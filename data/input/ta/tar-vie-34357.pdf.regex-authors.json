Viet  Nam  has  experienced  strong  economic  growth  in  recent  years  and  seeks  to \nenhance social safety nets by strengthening the social security system. It provides various \nbenefits in case of old age, maternity, and some unfortunate events. These benefits are critical \nto prevent and reduce the poverty of low-income households and those vulnerable to sudden \nshocks such as sickness, work injury, and death of an income-earning relative. These benefits \nalso mobilize a large amount of long-term financial resources, which have an impact on financial \nmarket development.  \n \n2.  To  strengthen  the  social  security  system,  the  Government  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) in 2002. In response, the Fact-\nFinding Mission1 visited Hanoi from 16 to 20 June 2003 to reach an understanding with the \nGovernment on the TA objective, scope, cost, and implementation arrangements.2 The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The social security system was established in 1947. As of 1962 it covered less than 4% \nof the population, all in the public sector. Before 1995 the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social \nAffairs (MOLISA) and the trade unions jointly administered social security. In 1995 the Viet Nam \nSocial Security (VSS) was established to collect social security contributions, administer the \nSocial Insurance Fund, and ensure timely payments of social security.3 In early 2003 VSS was \nmerged  with  health  insurance.  The  social  security  system  is  developing quickly. The total \nnumber of contributors increased from 2.9 million in 1995 to 4.5 million in 2002. Despite fast-\ngrowing coverage, the social security system only covers 11 % of the 40-million workforce, and \nno informal sector workers.  \n \n4.  VSS  offers  long-term  benefits  (pensions  and  survivor\u2019s  pensions)  and  short-term \nbenefits (maternity, sickness, and work injury). Pension schemes include those for old age, and \nreduced, privileged, and early pensions. The pension amount is based on the number of years \ncontributions were paid and average salary for the last 5 years. If a pensioner dies, up to four \nfamily members receive a long-term death benefit. A regularly employed woman who has given \nbirth normally is entitled to maternity benefit of 100% of salary 4 months before and after birth. \nSickness benefit provides for payment of 75% of salary. While an employee with longer service \nmay claim more sick days (30\u201350) per year, those who require long\u2013term treatment receive \nunlimited sickness benefits. In case of accidents on the job and occupational diseases, the \nemployer pays for medical treatment, salary, and other related costs during treatment. \n \n5.  The  system  is  in  surplus,  but  as the  population  ages, the  social  security  system\u2019s \nfinancial  sustainability  is  in  question.  The  Government  has  committed  to  expanding  the \ncoverage of social security while maintaining the system\u2019s financial sustainability. A strong legal \nframework should be established, VSS modernized through good governance and upgraded \nbusiness process, and an independent financial investment policy adopted. \n \n                                                \n1 The Mission comprised X. Zhang (financial economist, Governance, Finance and Trade Division [MKGF] ); S. \nHattori (senior financial sector specialist, MKGF); and B.T. Nghia (financial sector specialist, Viet Nam Resident \nMission). \n2 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 1 August 2003. \n3 Decree 12-CP Issuing the Regulation of Social Security (26 January 1995) and Decree 19-CP Founding of Viet \nNam Social Security (16 February 1995). ", "2 \nA.  Legal Framework \n6.  The social security system is organized pursuant to the Labor Code of 2002 and several \ndecrees. The Labor Code defines labor contracts, which are the prerequisite for social security \ncoverage; the decrees define the structure and functions of VSS and relevant regulations. To \nexpand  social  security  coverage,  labor  contracts  should  be  signed,  even  for  the  mobile \nworkforce  of  private  enterprises.  Reliance  on  decrees  instead  of  legislation  weakens \nenforcement as they do not contain any enforcement measures. A social security law is required \nto provide VSS with enforcement powers and to specify the rights and duties with respect to \nVSS contributions and benefits.  \n \n7.  The Government has assembled a social security law committee and a working group \nconsisting of 10 ministries and unions to draft a social security law for adoption by 2005, and \nidentify ways to resolve various policy issues. These include sustainability of the social security \nsystem, how social security can be expanded legally, collection system for social security, and \ndesign  of  various  pension  schemes.  Although  the  Government  has  agreed  that  financial \nsustainability  is  key  to  pension-related  policies,  fleshing  them  out  requires  solid  actuarial \nanalysis. This will pose a challenge to the committee and its working group as they have limited \nexperience and technical capacity.  \n \nB.  Institutional Setup \n8.  VSS has approximately 9,000 staff working in the national office in Hanoi, 64 provincial \nor city offices, and 598 district offices. Besides lack of legal authority, VSS suffers from a \nnumber of weaknesses, including inadequate governance, inadequate business procedures, \nand lack of automation. \n \n9.  VSS is governed by a management board composed of representatives of MOLISA, \nMinistry of Health, the trade union, and a director general. The director general is responsible \nfor daily management. VSS corporate governance raises several difficult concerns. First, VSS is \nexplicitly subordinate to the Prime Minister, who determines its investment strategy, subjecting \nVSS investment and future sustainability of VSS to political considerations. Another governance \nissue is that VSS does not represent employers.  \n \n10.  VSS business procedures need to be reviewed to ensure administrative improvement, \nincluding reorganization, to enhance the efficiency of staff. VSS still functions with 100% cash \npayments of benefits and without any network connection between the national office and \nprovincial  and  district  offices.  VSS  needs  to  upgrade  its  national  and  local  administrative \nstructure, payment agent system, accounting and auditing system, and office automation.  \n \nC.  Financial Sustainability \n11.  The Social Security Fund (SSF), covering all five types of social security, has total \nassets of D20 trillion ($1.33 billion); 56 % of the fund is invested in bank deposits, 40 % \nallocated to the government budget, and the remainder invested in government bonds and \nTreasury bills. These investments\u2019 annual return is around 4 %, and the profit goes back to the \nfund. Contributors 20 to 39 years old account for nearly 70 % of the total, and the system is \nprofitable largely because the participants are young. As the population ages, the number of \nbeneficiaries will increase, but the number of contributors is unlikely to increase as quickly. The \nfund\u2019s income is estimated to fall short of the payout by 2020. \n ", "    3 \n12.  Other factors concerning financial sustainability of SSF include low retirement age (60 \nfor men and 55 for women), front-loaded benefit formula (participants accrue 60 % of pension in \nthe first half of their career), low employer's contribution, and close linkage between pension \nand wage growth. This concern becomes more serious as budget support of the social security \nsystem decreases.4 \n \n13.  The investment policy may also adversely affect SSF returns. Fund management is \ndecided at an annual meeting of VSS's management board. The director general, as directed by \nthe Prime Minister, makes investment decisions. Investment decisions are, therefore, subject to \npolitical  considerations.  This  is  contrary  to  international  best  practice,  which  requires  that \npension institutions be insulated to the extent possible from political decisions so as to provide \nobjective  information  and  investment  in  the  participants\u2019  interests.  To  ensure  financial \nsustainability, VSS needs to develop an independent investment policy to preserve assets, \nenhance liquidity, and increase income for the sole and exclusive benefit of participants. The \ninvestment policy should consider the feasibility of financial sector investments. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The TA aims to develop a sustainable social security system with expanded coverage. \nThe purpose is to reduce vulnerability of the social security system, especially for poor and low-\nincome households. The TA has two components: \n \n1.  Component A, to be implemented by MOLISA, will have three major outputs:  \na.  a study on the informal sector's involvement in the social security system, \nwith focus on policy options, to be the base for a draft social security \nstrategy for the poor and informal sector; \nb.  a draft social security law, and related implementing policies as well as \namendments to the Labor Code and Income Tax Law; and \nc.  a proposal for social security system design to improve financial \nsustainability and coverage, which should be backed by statistical models \nand actuarial analysis. \n2.  Component B, to be implemented by VSS, will accomplish the following: \n \na.  Formulate a plan for administrative redesign of VSS, with descriptions of \nfunctions and tasks. The plan should be time-bound with clear \nbenchmarks, potential issues and problems, and detailed cost estimates. \n                                                \n4  When VSS was created, the Government paid the pensions of those who retired before 1995. As a result, a large \nportion of VSS benefits is funded by the state budget. This amount is expected to decrease as those who were \nretired in 1995 cease receiving pensions. ", "4 \nb.  Explore VSS investment strategies by developing an independent \ninvestment policy to preserve assets and enhance liquidity and increase \nincome for the beneficiaries, and by assessing the feasibility of financial \nsector investment.  \nc.  Conduct financial analysis and projections for SSF. \nd.  Upgrade the accounting system based on the newly adopted accounting \nstandards. \ne.  Propose an information technology system design for VSS based on the \nnew pension system and business process. \nf.  Conduct a survey on the informal sector's involvement in the social \nsecurity system, with focus on cost implications. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  TA implementation will integrate consultants\u2019 inputs into the daily work of the counterpart. \nTo support drafting of a social security law and provide advice on policy issues, MOLISA legal \nstaff will be assigned to work with an international legal expert to assure mutual understanding \nof different legal points and to explore solutions.  \n \n16.  To help VSS upgrade its business process, a social security administration expert will be \nrecruited to work closely with VSS staff in Hanoi as well as in provincial and district offices. \nBesides officers at the national office, a director-level official from a VSS provincial office will be \nappointed as counterpart staff. To ensure knowledge transfer, regular on-the-job training and \nroundtable discussions will be conducted.  \n \n17.  To  explore  opportunities for  the  informal sector\u2019s  involvement  in  the  social  security \nsystem, VSS will conduct a survey targeting the informal workforce. VSS will consult MOLISA \non the survey design and target group, and MOLISA will ensure that the survey outputs will be \nincorporated into the draft social security strategy for the poor and informal sector. To ensure \nthat the interests of the poor (mostly in the private or informal sector) are thoroughly considered \nand incorporated, a public information campaign and public consultation will be conducted \nduring the drafting of the social security law. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  TA,  estimated  to  cost  $940,000  equivalent,  includes  foreign  exchange  cost  of \n$468,000 and local currency cost of $472,000 equivalent. A total of $750,000 equivalent\u2014the \ntotal foreign exchange cost and $282,000 equivalent of local currency cost\u2014will be financed on \na grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. The TA will be administered by ADB. \nComponent A will have a total cost of $250,000, of which $174,000 will be in foreign currency, \nand $76,000 equivalent in local currency. Component B is estimated at $500,000 in total, of \nwhich $294,000 will be in foreign exchange, and $206,000 equivalent in local currency. The \nGovernment will contribute $190,000 equivalent in kind for office space, counterpart staff, and \nmiscellaneous  services.  Details  of  the  cost  estimates  and  proposed  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 3. \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOLISA and VSS will be the executing agencies (EAs) for the TA. They are expected to \nprovide  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  support  services  to  the  consultants.  To \nfacilitate effective implementation of component A, an interministerial working group to draft the \nsocial  security  law  was  established  in  July  2003.  The  working  group,  consisting  of \nrepresentatives from the ministries of finance, justice, interior, public security, defense, and \nhealth; MOLISA; VSS; Farmer's Association; and Union of Cooperatives, will play a coordination \nrole.  \n \n20.  ADB will engage a team of international and domestic consultants to provide consulting \nservices for 43.5 person-months. Component A involves 17.5 person-months of consultant input, \nand all consultants will be selected on an individual basis. A consulting firm will be selected for \ncomponent B, which involves 26 person-months of consultant input. Consultants will be selected \nand engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Consultants\u2019  terms  of \nreference  are  in  Appendix  4.  The  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used  to  select  the \nconsultant firm for component B. \n \n21.  The consultants will prepare a detailed work plan before their services start, including a \ntimetable for deliverables defined under each TA component. (Consultants are required to \ndeliver outputs according to schedule and in a format agreed upon with ADB and the EAs at the \ntime of contract negotiation.) Each output will be reviewed by the EAs and ADB. Draft final \nreport will be prepared, and a tripartite meeting will be held to discuss it. The final report, \nincorporating comments of the EAs and ADB, will be submitted upon completion of service. The \nTA is scheduled to commence in January 2004 and be completed by December 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nDeveloping the Social Security System, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

The study on the informal sector's involvement in the social security system will have \nthree major sections: (i) an examination of the structure and income of the informal sectors, and \na medium- and long-term forecast, which will provide a basis to analyze the feasibility of the \ninformal sector's involvement in the social security system; (ii) a list social security benefit \noptions indicating the estimated number of participants in the proposed schemes, finance, and \nother implications for participants, the Government, and other parties, and an exploration of the \nfeasibility and implications of voluntary pension scheme and unemployment insurance; and (iii)  \ninternational, especially regional, experience of the informal sector\u2019s social security scheme \ndesigns and practices, and the possibility of adopting these designs and practices in Viet Nam. \n \nB.  Structure of the Survey  \n2.  The survey on the informal sector's involvement in the social security system intends to \ngather data in three areas: (i) demographic information, including age, gender, number of family \nmembers, years of employment, type of employer, and the like; (ii) income data such as salary \nin the contract, other income from employment, and income from other family members; and (ii) \ndata  related  to  social  security  benefits,  indicating  current  benefit  schemes,  willingness  to \nparticipate in social security benefits, etc. \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Study and Survey \n3.  The study and survey on the informal sector's involvement in the social security system \nwill provide background information and reference material for the Government's strategy for the \ninformal sector's involvement in the social security system. First, decision-making authorities will \nbe able to identify options for the informal sector's involvement in the social security system. \nSecond, the authorities and other stakeholders will be clear about the financial, institutional, and \nhuman  resources  needed  to  implement  the  proposed  schemes.  Referring  to  international \nexperience,  the  authorities  will  be  able  to  make  policy  and  other  decisions  with  full \nunderstanding of their implications, ensuring implementation of the social security scheme for \ninformal sector participants, and helping reduce the vulnerability and poverty of the poor and \nlow-income population. \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n  \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
