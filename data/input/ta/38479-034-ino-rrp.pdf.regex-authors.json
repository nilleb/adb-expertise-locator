THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nloan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Regional Roads Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve about 476 kilometers (km) of strategic and national roads in \nfour  provinces2 of Indonesia. The  roads  are  in  less  developed  and  poorer  areas  of  the \nprovinces.  Roads were selected through project preparatory technical assistance3 based on \ncorridor development and regional connectivity criteria to maximize development impacts and \nbenefits. The project is consistent with the strategic priorities of the Indonesia country strategy \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), 4  through  supporting  investment  in  transport \ninfrastructure to promote inclusive growth and reduce disparities across less-developed areas \nof the country. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Strategic  context.  Indonesia is a middle-income country with varied development \nacross its provinces and islands. The Government of Indonesia plans to promote sustainable \neconomic growth by significantly increasing infrastructure investment over the next 5 years. \nTo achieve more equitable development across the country, the government recognizes the \nurgent need to (i) improve transport accessibility in less-developed areas, which will also \nreduce poverty in local communities; and (ii) expand long-term growth opportunities and \nattract investment through the development of stronger trade ties under regional cooperation \ninitiatives. \n \n4.  The proposed project will improve strategic and national road corridors in northern \nKalimantan and southern Java to support economic growth in these two less developed and \npoorer areas of the country. The rehabilitation and capacity expansion of road corridors will \nstrengthen  national  and  regional  connectivity,  and  improve  access  to  markets,  job \nopportunities, and social services. The national road network in southern Java is incomplete, \nwith some road sections of the southern Trans Java Highway not yet constructed, resulting in \ngaps in network coverage; other sections are constructed below national standards and are in \npoor condition. Improved road infrastructure in southern Java is necessary to remove existing \nconstraints to economic growth and investment in this isolated area. Similarly, road network \nimprovements are needed to support economic development in less-developed and remote \ndistricts in northern Kalimantan. Improved road connections in Kalimantan to the Malaysian \nborder  will  support  the  Brunei  Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines\u2013East  ASEAN \nGrowth Area (BIMP-EAGA) transport initiatives to develop two land-based transport corridors \nfor greater connectivity and reduced transport costs5, as well as complement other BIMP-\nEAGA programs to reduce nonphysical barriers to trade by improving customs, immigration, \nquarantine, and security. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   East Java, Central Java, East Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan provinces.  \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2008.

Manila (TA \n6174-REG). ", "2 \n5.  The road subsector. Roads are the dominant mode of transport in Indonesia, meeting \n83% of passenger and 70% of freight demand. Although Indonesia has a vast network of \nroads with 37,500 kilometers (km) of national roads, 41,100 km of provincial roads, and \n249,000 km of district (kabupaten) roads, the density of the national road network is relatively \nlow at about 0.4 km per 1,000 square kilometers (km2), and is significantly lower in less-\ndeveloped areas.6 Road transport demand in the country has been growing significantly faster \nthan the gross domestic product for nearly a decade, and congestion on the arterial road \nnetwork is becoming a widespread problem, especially in Java.  \n \n6.  Roads are a key enabler for the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, as they improve \npeople\u2019s access to education, health services, and job opportunities. In recent years, the \ngovernment has concentrated on eliminating the large maintenance backlog for the national \nhighway network, rather than expand the road network. This has limited funding for improving \naccess to areas away from primary traffic corridors. In addition to persistent maintenance \nrequirements, ongoing challenges include poor interdepartmental coordination, inadequate \ninstitutional capacity, poor control of vehicle overloading, and insufficient focus on road safety. \nThe government\u2019s 2010\u20132014 strategy for national highways7 is to ensure that roads are \nimproved and constructed to enhance connectivity between major towns in order to increase \naccess to markets and other centers of economic activity, including (i) expansion of road \ncapacity to meet traffic demand; and (ii) extension of the road network to serve poor, isolated \ncommunities and to promote regional cooperation with neighboring countries. \n \n7.  Road financing and sustainability. National road budgets have more than doubled \nfrom $1.0 billion in 2002 to almost $2.1 billion in 2009, equivalent to average annual growth of \n7%\u20138% in real terms but lower than the average growth in vehicles and transport demand. \nDespite this increase in funding, improper maintenance planning, inadequate standards, and \npoor implementation have contributed to unsustainable outcomes. Variable quality of work, \nshort-life  design  standards,  and  inconsistent  supervision  for  maintenance  and  new \nconstruction  works  reduce  the  life  of  road  assets,  which  subsequently  require  higher \nmaintenance  expenditure.  In  addition,  endemic  vehicle  overloading  accelerates  the \ndeterioration of roads. The government has come to recognize that new and more cost-\neffective road maintenance practices are essential to improve overall road conditions and to \nreduce  transport  and  logistics  costs.  Sustainability  of  the  road  subsector  also  requires \ninstitutional  capacities  to  be  strengthened,  especially  at  the  provincial  level  given  the \ndecentralization of responsibilities, particularly for road maintenance.  \n \n8.  Relevance. The government\u2019s medium-term development goals commit to increasing \nsustainable economic growth, creating jobs, and accelerating achievement of its millennium \ndevelopment goals.8 Infrastructure development and investment\u2014including that related to \nroad transport\u2014is critical to meeting these objectives. Improvement of road infrastructure is a \nkey  priority  under  the  government's  2010\u20132014  5-year  medium-term  strategy,  and  is \nconsistent with the Indonesia transport sector assessment, strategy, and road map of the ADB \n(footnote 4). \n \n9.  Lessons. Lessons from previous ADB transport loans and sector assessments are \nincorporated in the project design. The focus on corridor development addresses the relatively \nlow impacts of recent loans for roads that were spread widely throughout the country. The \n                                                \n6  The road density for Kalimantan is only 0.19 km per 1,000 km2, compared with 0.90 km per 1,000 km2 in Java. \n7  Ministry of Public Works. 2009.

Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project will be increased efficiency of road transport supporting \nintegrated and sustainable economic growth along project corridors. The outcome will be \nimproved capacity and safety of national and strategic roads. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project outputs will consist of two components: (i) development of national and \nstrategic roads, and (ii) road sector development program. \n \n12.  The component to develop national and strategic roads includes rehabilitation and \nimprovement of approximately 476 km of existing roads, mainly within the existing right-of-\nway, in the four provinces of East and West Kalimantan, and East and Central Java. ADB will \nfinance approximately 400 km of roads and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) will finance \napproximately  76  km  of  roads.  This  component  includes  consulting  services  for  project \nmanagement, environment and social safeguards, and construction supervision. \n \n13.  The road sector development program component will include two subprograms: \n  \n(i)  Road  safety  strengthening  subprogram  (RSSP).  The RSSP  will adopt an \nintegrated multiagency approach to road safety to support implementation of the \nnew road traffic law enacted in June 2009. The RSSP will include (a) road safety \nengineering and audits; (b) a road safety awareness campaign for communities \nin the project districts, which will also address gender issues related to road \nsafety; (c) road safety training; and (d) strengthening capacity for overloading \nand speed enforcement. \n \n(ii)  Road sector subprogram (RSP). The RSP will address key road issues and \nbuild  capacity  in  road  agencies  by  (a)  developing  an  integrated  capacity \ndevelopment  program  for  national,  provincial,  and  district  road  agencies;  (b) \ndeveloping an anti HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program for project districts; \n(c) a study to develop an overall strategic approach to transport sector planning \nto  prioritize  investments;  and  (d)  designing  and  implementing  an  effective \napproach for an integrated vehicle overloading control strategy. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $380.5 million (Table 1).    \n \n15.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of $180  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \n ", "4 \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n16.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The IDB will provide parallel cofinancing of $65.0 million \nequivalent  under  Istisna  loan  terms,  9 which  was  approved  by  IDB  on  1  May  2011.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart financing of $135.5 million equivalent. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  ADB  IDB  Gov\u2019t    Amounta \nA.

Chaired by the National Development Planning \nAgency (BAPPENAS), a project steering committee representing BAPPENAS, the Ministry of \nFinance,  MPW,  and  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  will  monitor  and  coordinate  project \nimplementation. DGH will be the main implementing agency and provide support for civil works \nand road safety engineering. The three other implementing agencies are (i) the Directorate \nGeneral  of  Land  Transportation  for  road  safety  awareness,  road  safety  training,  and  the \noverloading control program; (ii) the Directorate of Traffic Police for the overloading and speed \nenforcement program; and (iii) the BAPPENAS Directorate of Transportation for the transport \nsector development strategy and policy study. DGH will establish a project management unit \n(PMU) headed by a manager with experience in externally financed projects. The PMU staff will \nbe responsible for day-to-day implementation, technical and financial reporting, and ensuring \ncompliance with ADB procurement and consulting guidelines and safeguard policies. The PMU \nwill include experienced engineers, accountants, and other staff as required and be supported \nby a core team of consultants. Based on successful implementation of previous ADB loans, \nDGH has sufficient capacity to implement the project.  \n \n18.  Of  the  11  civil  works  contracts,  3  are  in  Central  Java,  1  in  East  Java,  3  in West \nKalimantan, and 4 in East Kalimantan. IDB will finance the 3 contracts in Central Java; ADB and \nthe government will finance all other contracts. Of the 11 consulting services contracts, IDB will \nfinance the design review and supervision consulting services for the civil works in Central Java; \nADB  will  finance  the  remaining  consulting  services.

The project will rehabilitate and widen existing substandard two-lane national highways \nand strategic roads with asphalt in accordance with updated national highway standards. The \nproject roads will follow existing alignments, with some minor deviations from the right-of-way \nand realignment to comply with national highway standards. The civil works will strengthen the \nexisting road pavement and improve road alignments to meet forecast traffic demand. The \nimproved roads will increase capacity and safety of existing highways and provide new all-\nweather links to the border with Malaysia at Aruk and Simanggaris in West and East Kalimantan \nprovinces, respectively. The detailed design for all road sections is complete. DGH has verified \nthe cost estimates for the civil works for the project. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The project will benefit road users and communities in four provinces and indirectly \nbenefit adjoining provinces and neighboring countries. The main benefits derived from improved \naccessibility are better, safer, cheaper, and faster transportation. The better connectivity will \nprovide social benefits that include improved access to health, education, and other government \nservices. The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n13.0%. The sensitivity and switching value analyses shows that the EIRR is marginal and risks \nfalling below the 12% threshold. With a 20% change in user benefits and project costs, the \n ", "7 \nEIRR will decrease to 10%, which is considered acceptable as the project areas will experience \nsubstantive social benefits due to the improved road conditions. However, as conservative \nvalues are used for diverted and generated traffic, and cost increases should be low since \ndetailed design is complete, the probability of the EIRR falling below 12% is considered to be \nvery low. \n \n22.  The low project EIRR values are due to the large number of road projects that will \nimprove road links that connect with the border and presently have low traffic volume; benefits \nare mainly derived in later years as traffic volume and trade increase. Benefits from increased \ntrade traffic have been conservatively estimated, but potential for improved benefits is high, \nespecially  if  the  current  nonphysical  constraints  to  trade  are  lowered;  expected  regional \ncooperation  measures  under  BIMP-EAGA  initiatives  are  successfully  implemented;  and \nsustainable development is expanded, including proposed ecotourism measures in Kalimantan. \n \n23.  The project will be a public sector investment, as low traffic volume will not attract private \nsector participation. DGH currently allocates about $1.2 billion of the annual budget for routine, \nperiodic,  and  major  road  maintenance,  or  about  70%  of  the  annual  budget  for  national \nhighways. The maintenance budget is expected to increase over the next 5 years to fully meet \nneeds, and sufficient funding will be allocated for maintenance of project roads. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  The governance assessment, undertaken as part of the due diligence process, focuses \non DGH\u2019s capacity in financial management, procurement, enforcement of regulations, and \nother  institutional  issues  including  risk  of  corruption  during  procurement.  The  governance \nperformance of DGH has improved steadily in recent years. From 2007, DGH has incorporated \nan anticorruption action plan for all loan-funded projects, with specific measures adopted to \nmeet specific financier requirements. These measures include information disclosure, oversight \nand monitoring, mitigation of fraud and collusion risks, complaints handling, and sanctions and \nremedies. \n \n25.  The country's performance on national and local governance has been lacking in some \nareas, but progress is being made on several fronts. The establishment in December 2007 of \nthe National Public Procurement Agency and the Anti-Corruption Commission has resulted in \npositive changes in terms of monitoring and enforcement of good governance. A major problem \nis lack of transparency in the public procurement process, and difficulties in validating prices for \nforeign-funded  contracts  and  contract  variations.  The  project  will  include  international \ncompetitive  bidding,  which  improves  oversight  and  helps  mitigate  corrupt  practices.  This \nvalidation  process  improves  governance  but  can  also  cause  implementation  delays  if \ninformation is not readily shared. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Ministry of Finance and DGH. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM, including the proposed anticorruption action plan (footnote \n10). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The project is a general intervention with indirect poverty reduction impacts. For the \ncoastal  highway  in  Southern  Java,  road  transportation  is  still  constrained  by  poor  road \nconditions and much of the traffic flow is for the transport of agricultural commodities from \n ", "8 \npoorer areas to larger northern cities. Local economies are expected to benefit from lower \ntransport costs to major centers and better access to lateral markets where current connections \nare poor or nonexistent. With improved east\u2013west access and easier access to the southern \nbeaches, tourism opportunities will increase and improve prospects for local businesses. In \nKalimantan,  upgrading  two  international  border  corridors  will  promote  interregional  and \ninternational linkages, and provide alternate markets and opportunities for local communities. \nAccess to alternative sources of goods will reduce costs, promote all-year access, and increase \nthe potential for small and medium-scale entrepreneurs to develop sustainable businesses. In \nall areas, the improved road access will facilitate government administration and social service \ndelivery, which will also promote women\u2019s empowerment through access to and use of relevant \nservices, resources, assets, and opportunities. \n28.  Local  communities  will  benefit  from  temporary  construction  jobs,  and  routine \nmaintenance will employ unskilled and semiskilled workers. The employment and fair treatment \nof  women  in  construction  and  maintenance  will  be  encouraged.  DGH  will  ensure  that \nemployment opportunities are announced to local communities and will ensure that contractors \nconform with appropriate labor laws and standards. \n \n29.  The potential adverse social impacts from the project are increased risk of exposure to \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking of women and children during construction and operation due \nto the influx of construction workers, improved border connections, and increased transit traffic. \nSafety risks will increase for communities along the road because of increased traffic and higher \nvehicle  speeds  along  the  improved  road.  These  risks  will  be  addressed  through  the  anti \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness and prevention program (AHHTAPP) and RSP. \nFocus  will  be  placed  on  supporting  local  communities  in  designing,  implementing,  and \nmonitoring community-based, gender responsive,  and culturally  appropriate  AHHTAPP  and \nRSP awareness activities. All civil works contracts under the project incorporate provisions and \nbudgets to the effect that contractors carry out the AHHTAPP in the construction campsites in \ncoordination with the government's programs and other initiatives. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The project is classified category A for involuntary resettlement and category B for \nenvironment  and  indigenous  people.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  land \nacquisition and resettlement action plans (LARAPs) for project districts were prepared to meet \nthe requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The LARAPs, based on preliminary \ndesign of the roads, will be updated during project implementation.   \n \n31.  The  IEE  covers  a  general  environmental  profile  of  all  subprojects  and  includes  an \nassessment of potential environmental impacts during various project phases. It includes the \nenvironmental management plan with a set of mitigation and management measures to be \ntaken during project implementation to avoid, reduce, mitigate, or compensate for adverse \nenvironmental impacts. The subprojects could have some adverse environmental impacts, but \nthey  would  be  short-term,  temporary,  and  reversible;  the  impacts  can  be  minimized  and \nmanaged by implementing mitigation measures.  \n \n32.  No subprojects will pass through conservation forests. One subproject in Java and six in \nKalimantan will pass through forests that are protected or used for production, but no tree \ncutting and land acquisition in such forests will be needed. No rare, threatened, or endangered \nspecies of flora and fauna are in or close to the subproject areas. No heritage sites of national \nand international importance, or sites that are historically or archaeologically sensitive, are in or \n ", "9 \nnear the subproject areas. Consultations were conducted from September 2008 to August 2011 \ninvolving  about  275  people  including  affected  people,  community  leaders,  nongovernment \norganizations, and national and provincial government officials. The IEE is available to the \npublic through the DGH office and ADB\u2019s website. \n \n33.  The Tambakmulyo\u2014Wawar road (38.5 km) is one of the three sections in Central Java.  \nThe land acquisition for the first 24 km of Tambakmulyo\u2014Wawar road was completed,11 for the \nremaining 14.5 km, a LARAP was prepared. As the resettlement impacts will be significant, this \nsubproject road is classified category A for involuntary resettlement.  About 145 households will \nbe severely affected; 106 households will lose at least 10% of their productive land, while 31 \nhouses and 8 shops will be physical displaced. A total of1,400 households will be marginally \naffected by this subproject.  Land acquisition for the other two subprojects in Central Java, has \nbeen completed (footnote 11). The 10 subprojects in East Java, and East and West Kalimantan \nprovinces  are  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts will not be significant. LARAPs for East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, and \nEast  Java  were  prepared.  About  530  households  will  be  marginally  affected  by  these  10 \nsubprojects.   \n \n34.  During the preparation of the LARAPs for all subproject roads, meetings were held with \npotentially affected households and other stakeholders to determine potential impacts on land, \nnon-land assets, and income of households along the subproject roads. The aim was to elicit \nconcerns and suggestions from the stakeholders to mitigate, if not avoid, these impacts. Key \ninformation in the LARAPs was disclosed to the affected people. No site clearing will be done \nuntil after DGH and ADB have agreed upon the updated LARAPs and the provisions in the \nupdated LARAPs have been implemented satisfactorily. \n \n35.  Ethnic groups, such as Melayu, Chinese, and Dayak, live along the roads in West \nKalimantan. They have been integrated into the wider socio-economic and cultural community, \nwhile retaining many aspects of their culture. Specific actions related to ethnic groups are \nincluded  in  the  LARAPs,  such  as  consultation  measures  that  use  local  leaders  and  the \ntraditional grievance redress process for Dayak people.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The project will involve standard road design and construction techniques; the risks \nassociated with project design and construction are minimal. However, the greatest risks during \nproject implementation will be related to public financial management, procurement, corruption, \nand  due  diligence.  Risks  to  sustainability  and  policy  reform  require  the  application  and \nenforcement  of  appropriate  mitigation  measures.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.12 Benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n \n   \n                                                \n11 For completed land acquisition, land owners are still allowed to use the land for farming and will be provided \nsufficient time to clear the land through socialization during project implementation. \n12 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of an effective policy for road  The government will expedite approval of the road safety \nsafety and inadequate control of  implementing regulations in 2012. \noverloaded vehicles \nThe government will complete the overloading assessment \nstudy in 2012 then implement the recommended measures. \nThe Traffic Police Corps will implement speeding and \noverloading enforcement program. \nDGH fails to maintain the project  Consultants will be appointed to help strengthen maintenance \nroads once improved  planning, funding, and implementation. \n  The government will assure availability of adequate funds and \nselected use of performance-based maintenance contracting. \nCorruption  DGH and ADB will implement annual project monitoring through \nthe anticorruption action plan and through two full review \nmissions, and make information available through the MPW and \nADB websites. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DGH = Directorate General of Highways, MPW = Ministry of Public Works. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  \n \n38.
