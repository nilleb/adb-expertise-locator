INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) established the Asia Pacific Project Preparation \nFacility (AP3F) in October 2014 to provide the additional resources and technical support for the \npreparation of public\u2013private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects in its developing member \ncountries (DMCs). This is expected to help increase the amount and quality of infrastructure in \nAsia and the Pacific by facilitating the use of PPP modalities. \n \n2.  PPPs have the potential for ADB to provide leverage and thought leadership. Under its \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020, ADB addresses PPP development \nholistically across four pillars: (i) advocacy, (ii) enabling environment, (iii) project development, \nand (iv) project financing.1 Under pillars 1 and 2, ADB is helping its DMCs to develop PPP \nframeworks and is providing PPP project-related support. Accordingly, ADB is in the unique \nposition to help advance its DMCs\u2019 knowledge on PPPs, apply recognized PPP principles and \nprocesses, and realize more PPP projects. \n \n3.  Through the AP3F, ADB will provide assistance to DMC governments and their public \nsector agencies to support the financial, legal, and technical advisory services required to \nprepare and structure PPP transactions, and bring them to the market. The AP3F can also \nprovide related assistance for (i) reform and improvement of policy, legislative, regulatory, and \ninstitutional  practices  in  DMCs,  where  this  is  linked  or  otherwise  complementary  to  such \ninfrastructure projects; and (ii) ongoing project monitoring and evaluation. This is expected to \nhelp increase the amount and quality of infrastructure in Asia and the Pacific by facilitating the \nuse of PPP modalities.  \n \n4.  The  proposed  cluster  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will \ncontribute to achieving the overall AP3F objective by providing upstream assistance to DMCs, \nessentially  increasing  their  capacity  to  prepare  and  undertake  PPPs  and  developing  the \nenabling environment for PPPs. The TA will help DMCs address the project preparation gap by \nsupporting a range of activities in DMCs to lay the groundwork (such as legislative and policy \nreform) necessary for DMCs to be able to tap the AP3F for further assistance in structuring \ntheir projects. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n5.  Asia\u2019s infrastructure demand is huge. While ADB predicts that Asia will need to spend \nabout $8 trillion from 2010 to 2020 just to maintain current economic growth, a report by \nPricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that Asia and the Pacific will need to spend $5.36 trillion \nannually on infrastructure by 2025\u2014representing nearly 60% of the world\u2019s total. Infrastructure \nprojects funded by national governments and development assistance, even when effectively \ndelivered and implemented, will not suffice to address this growing infrastructure demand gap. \n \n6.  Adequate investment in infrastructure is crucial to promoting further growth of Asia and \nthe Pacific, spreading the fruit of economic developments, and raising the living standards of \npeople  in  the  region.  Governments  have  a  key  role  to  play  in  promoting  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  investment.  The  region\u2019s  vast  savings  are  ripe  to  be  efficiently \nchanneled to funding long-term investment needs, thus helping the region to realize its full \ngrowth potential and lifting millions out of poverty. Governments need to draw on past lessons \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "2   \nand consider more commercial approaches as to how to engage the private sector in building, \noperating, and maintaining sustainable infrastructure assets. \n \n7.  Given the region\u2019s huge infrastructure needs, mobilizing private sector investments is \nvital.  PPPs  are  an  important  way  forward  since  they  can  offer  an  additional  procurement \napproach by tapping the private sector\u2019s financial resources and skills in delivering infrastructure \neffectively  and  efficiently  on  a  whole  life  cycle  cost  basis.  However,  PPP  development  is \nconstrained by limited or lack of understanding of PPP contracts, risk allocation, and lack of \ngovernment  capacity  for  project  identification  and  preparation.  Underdeveloped  regulatory \nframeworks  and  unclear  implementation,  as  well  as  limited  coordination  among  central \nministries,  also  contributed  to  the  slow  uptake  of  PPPs  as  a  procurement  modality.  PPP \nschemes are generally long-term partnerships, so governments must possess, develop, and/or \nretain sufficient expertise to  be able to understand the PPP arrangements, carry out  their \nobligations under the PPP agreement, and monitor the performance of the private sector, and \nenforce their obligations. \n \n8.  Another  pressing  challenge  that  DMCs  face  is  the  lack  of  effective  PPP  project \npreparation. There is a shortage of well-prepared, bankable PPP projects where investors are \nsufficiently reassured by the commercial and technical feasibility, the risk allocation, the public \nsector\u2019s contractual commitment and capacity as well as the institutional and legal framework. \n \n9.  The PPP project preparation process is quite complex, as it involves large teams and \nmultiple stakeholders (including ministries, regulators, engineering firms, banks, and users) as \nwell as a multitude of interfaces between the different functional feasibility studies and the \nregulatory  contract  design.  So  it  is  of  paramount  importance  to  assemble  capable  and \nexperienced teams within a well-defined governance structure, backed by strong and committed \npolitical and project leadership. High-quality project preparation is also costly and, in many \ncases, insufficient or ad hoc funding has led to poor quality, inconsistencies, and delays in \nproject preparation. PPP planners need to ensure sufficient up-front funding, to be disbursed at \nset milestones, to conduct a thorough feasibility study. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The TA will support capacity development in preparing infrastructure projects to be \nprocured  using  the  PPP  modality.  It  will  support  policy  dialogues,  capacity  building,  and \ninstitutional  strengthening  to  improve  planning  and  project  identification,  and  changes  and \nmodifications to policy and regulatory frameworks to enhance the enabling environment for \nPPPs. The TA will also provide ongoing project monitoring and restructuring. \n \n11.  The TA will use the cluster approach, targeting upstream activities, including sector or \npolicy reform, linked to potential projects being prepared. The cluster approach is proposed \nbecause the subprojects are interrelated and will address the challenges of having better-\nprepared projects. The cluster modality will maximize TA coherence and coordination better \nthan an individual TA approach. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be contributing to increasing private sector investment in infrastructure \nprojects. The outcome will be an increase in the number of properly prepared infrastructure \nprojects that attract private sector investments. \n ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will provide ancillary support for the preparation, structuring, and financing of \ninfrastructure PPP projects of ADB\u2019s DMCs. It is intended to streamline DMCs\u2019 access to the \nresources  of  the  AP3F.  It  will  help  them  respond  appropriately  and  expeditiously  to  the \nchallenges  and  issues  in  developing  and  financing  infrastructure  projects  through  PPP \napproaches. Within the framework of the implementation guidelines, as set out under the AP3F, \nthe TA will support a range of upstream activities and will give priority to projects that (i) have a \npositive impact on regional connectivity and support regional economic integration; (ii) take into \naccount  climate  change  and  are  demonstrably  climate-friendly  and  climate-resilient;  and \n(iii) demonstrate value for money and the potential for replication in the sector, country, and/or \nregion. \n \n14.  The TA will have three subprojects, to be carried out under the overall framework of the \nAP3F and in close coordination with ADB\u2019s regional departments. Subproject 1 will provide \ncapacity  development  support  to  DMCs  to  continuously  improve  their  skills  in  project \nidentification, preparation, and management. Subproject 2 will provide support to DMCs in \nmonitoring  the  operational  performance  of  a  specific  PPP  project,  and  during  project \nrestructuring. Subproject 3 will support DMCs to undertake the necessary reforms to facilitate \nPPPs. These subprojects may be undertaken in a single DMC at the same time. ADB will \ndetermine what type of intervention is needed and plan the sequence of such intervention \naccordingly. \n \n(i)  Subproject  1:  Support  for  capacity  development,  knowledge  and \nnetworking support. This component will help assess and build the capacity of \nnational  and  local governments,  stakeholders, and  other  project sponsors  to \nidentify, develop, structure, and implement infrastructure PPP projects. This will \ninclude  assessing  and  building  the  capacity  for  multi-stakeholder,  integrated \ninfrastructure  and  strategy  planning;  capital  investment  planning  and \nprogramming; financial management; and project management and supervision. \nIt will also include knowledge generation and dissemination on policy, fiscal, and \ninstitutional frameworks for sustainable delivery of PPP projects. \n \n(ii)  Subproject 2: Support for ongoing monitoring and project restructuring. \nThis  component  will  provide  support  to  DMC  agencies  in  monitoring  project \nperformance  against  the  key  performance  indicators  set  out  in  the  project \nagreement  to  ensure  that  service  delivery  is  in  accordance  with  the  output \nspecification.  This  will  also  include  support  to  the  DMC  during  project \nrestructuring, provided that the DMC has not been the party causing default, \nexcept in the case of political force majeure. \n \n(iii)  Subproject 3: Support for the establishment of enabling environment for \npublic\u2013private partnerships. This will include advising DMC agencies (such as \nline  ministries  and  PPP  units)  on  enabling  reforms  (such  as  changes  to \nlegislation, policy, and regulatory frameworks; and possible use of guarantees, \nviability  gap  financing,  new  financing  vehicles,  and  investment  incentive \nschemes); appropriate PPP project selection criteria; staff training; and market \nand/or stakeholder awareness. \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $10 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and broken down as follows: (i) subproject 1: \n$5.00 million, (ii) subproject 2: $2.86 million, and (iii) subproject 3: $2.14 million. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will coordinate the TA through its Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership. Upon TA \napproval, the subproject proposals will be submitted for approval to the Head, Office of Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership, in accordance with ADB guidelines on cluster TA processing.2 ADB will be \nthe executing agency and implementing agency for each subproject, and will work closely with \nregional departments, DMCs, and AP3F financing partners. The TA will finance consulting \nservices;  workshops  and  training  events,  including  study  visits  and  resource  persons; \npreparation  of  reports  and  knowledge  products;  as  well  as  communication,  miscellaneous \nadministration, support costs, and equipment. The TA and its subprojects are expected to be \nimplemented from January 2016 to December 2019. \n \n17.  The TA activities will be coordinated with other ongoing ADB projects under the overall \nframework of the AP3F. All subprojects will be supported and monitored by ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments, and activities will be closely coordinated with them. \n \n18.  Input of 271.9 person-months of international consultants and 127.3 person-months of \nnational consultants is envisaged. Different methods of consultant selection will be applied, \ndepending on the size and nature of the contracts. Consultants may be engaged via consulting \nfirms(s) or individually. Consultants will be engaged using the following procurement modalities: \n(i) quality- and cost-based selection using a financial ratio of 90:10; (ii) quality-based selection; \n(iii)  consultant  qualification  selection;  and  (iv)  single  source  selection,  as  appropriate.  All \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants for subprojects are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  All procurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nE.  Governance \n \n20.  The core TA implementation team will consist of management level staff, technical staff, \nand consultants with PPP and/or project finance expertise. The team will regularly communicate \nwith the subproject teams, AP3F financing partners, and other partners; organize meetings; and \nprepare  reports  required  by  ADB  and  AP3F  partners.  The  TA  will  be  monitored  through \nassessment of quality and timely delivery of outputs. Overall TA results will be disseminated \nthrough the AP3F donor meetings, PPP thematic group, and other relevant sector and thematic \ngroups. \n \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2013.
