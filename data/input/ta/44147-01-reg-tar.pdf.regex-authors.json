INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy 2020 of ADB identifies regional integration as one of three complementary \nstrategic agendas.1 Infrastructure and regional cooperation and integration belong to the five \ncore specializations that support the agendas. Strategy 2020 envisions (i) building physical \nassets and an enabling environment for private sector participation (including public\u2013private \npartnerships),  (ii)  promoting  institutional  and  policy  reforms,  and  (iii)  supporting  trade  and \ninvestments. The flagship study Infrastructure Development for a Seamless Asia,2 published by \nADB and the ADBI in 2009, estimated that infrastructure development in Asia and the Pacific \nwould require about $8 trillion during 2010\u20132020.3 This means that the region has to mobilize all \navailable resources and develop a comprehensive approach to infrastructure development, \nincluding  the  identification  and  preparation  of  priority  projects,  design  of  new  financing \nmodalities, and policy and capacity development to facilitate regional infrastructure integration.  \n \n2.  Infrastructure development produces important benefits and externalities. Its substantial \nimpact  on  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  trade  and  investment,  private  sector \ndevelopment, climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as regional cooperation and \nintegration is well known. Thus, infrastructure development is essential for the region's overall \ndevelopment. In recognition of the importance of regional infrastructure development, this TA \naims to enhance connectivity in Asia and the Pacific by developing a regional project pipeline.4 \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB's  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Strategy  identifies  infrastructure \ndevelopment as one of the pillars of regional development. The strategy states that physical \nconnectivity is essential for the active and productive movement of goods, services, capital, \npeople, and information across countries. When combined with policy components such as \nharmonization  of  cross-border  regulations,  immense  gains  can  be  achieved.  As  the  costs \nassociated with this effort are substantial, ADB's role is to provide financial support and to \nfacilitate  policy  coordination,  capacity  development,  and  knowledge  generation  and \ndissemination in the region. \n \n4.  The  importance  of  infrastructure  for  regional  cooperation  and  integration  was \ndemonstrated in a 2008 book published by the World Bank.5 The authors of a chapter on \ninfrastructure and regional cooperation argued that since the region\u2014particularly East Asia\u2014\nhad  become  a  dominant  part  of  international  production  networks  and  supply  chains,  its \ncompetitiveness  needed  to  be  reinforced  through  regional  cooperation  for  cross-border \ninfrastructure.  Regional  connectivity  is  crucial,  because  it  supports  complementarities  in \nproduction across the entire region, going beyond national boundaries. The need to reduce \ntransport and logistics costs, by connecting production clusters in different countries and linking \nthese clusters with markets, will be a major challenge in the next few decades. \n \n                                                \n1   The other two strategic agendas are inclusive growth and environmentally sustainable growth. \n2  ADB and ADBI. 2009. Infrastructure Development for a Seamless Asia. Manila. \n3  These needs must be seen against the backdrop of the recent global financial turmoil and the resulting decline in \nprivate investments.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 May 2010.  \n5  H. Kuroda, M. Kawai, and R. Nangia. 2008. \"Infrastructure and Regional Cooperation,\" in F. Bourguignon and B. \nPleskovic, eds. Rethinking Infrastructure for Development. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n ", "2   \n5.  In this regard, the Asian Highway Network (AHN)6 and Trans-Asian Railway (TAR)7 \nnetworks, which have been promoted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission \nfor  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (UNESCAP),  are  key  project  pipelines  for  regional  infrastructure \nintegration. The AHN and TAR together consist of more than 200,000 kilometers (km) of roads \nand railways. In 2005, the Intergovernmental Agreement on the AHN came into force, while the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on the TAR Network was adopted in 2006. These agreements \nindicate a high level of commitment to regional connectivity and the development of the two \nnetworks. \n \n6.  A  2009  study  by  ADB  provided  an  in-depth  analysis  of  its  contribution  to  the \nimplementation of the AHN.8 The study confirmed that connectivity across borders brought \nmany benefits, including improved competitiveness of production networks, higher trade flows, \nand reductions in development gaps between rich and poor countries. The study revealed that \nof the AHN\u2019s total length of about 142,000 km, about 106,000 km was in ADB\u2019s developing \nmember countries (DMCs); and that ADB had financed almost 18,000 km, or 20%, of the \nnetwork length. This is a significant contribution, reflecting the importance attached by ADB to \nregional integration. \n \n7.  To accelerate the physical development of the AHN and TAR, as well as to further scale \nup ADB support, the following tasks are deemed to remain:  \n\uf0b7  Updating  and  prioritizing  the  AHN  and  TAR.  Although  comprehensive \ndatabases  have  been  established,  and  road  and  railway  routes  have  been \nformally agreed upon by UNESCAP and the participating countries, a detailed \nanalysis of AHN and TAR configuration and priority projects is required to ensure \ntheir relevance, and economic and financial viability. For ADB, a set of priority \nprojects needs to be developed to provide additional assistance, in consultation \nwith the DMCs and ADB's regional departments concerned.  \n\uf0b7  Enhancing  the  link  between  trade  and  transport.  As  the  AHN and  TAR \nrepresent the main regional transport corridors, a significant opportunity exists for \nenhancing the link between trade and transport as a way to promote regional \nproduction networks further.9 This requires in-depth stock-taking of the activities \nto promote the link between transport and trade, as well as identifying such \nopportunities  related  to the AHN and  TAR.  Logistics facilities,  including  \"dry \nports\", will also have to be assessed in this context. An action plan on knowledge \nproducts and dissemination events related to the link is also required.  \n                                                \n6  The AH comprises about 142,000 kilometers (km) of roads passing through 32 member countries.  The AH \nnetwork is based on the principle that existing and potential trade flows should be the main criterion for inclusion \nand that the following routes should be incorporated, where appropriate: (i) capital-to-capital links, (ii) connections \nto main industrial and agriculture centers, (iii) connections to major sea and river ports, (iv) connections to major \ninland container terminals and depots, and (v) connections to major tourist attractions.  \n7  The TAR comprises about 114,000 km of railways connecting capitals, industrial centers, and ports in 28 member \ncountries. The TAR network design is based on the same principles as the AH.  \n8  S. Madhur, G. Wignaraja, and P. Darjes. 2009. Roads for Asian Integration: Measuring ADB's Contribution to the \nAsian Highway Network. ADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 37. Manila: Asian \nDevelopment Bank. \n9  Intraregional trade as a share of the region's total trade has increased dramatically. In 2006, it reached more than \n50% of the region's total trade. This growth has been fueled by a number of bilateral and multilateral free trade \nagreements. The most recent is the China\u2013ASEAN Free Trade Area (CAFTA), which covers six members of the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN):  Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand from 2010 onwards and will be expanded to include the other members (Cambodia, the \nLao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam) by 2015. In terms of population coverage, the CAFTA \nrepresents the largest trade agreement in the world.  \n ", "  3 \n\uf0b7  Establishing  a  regional  project  development  facility.  Based  on  the \nrecognition that the AHN and TAR require a significant level of investment, a \nmechanism to fund the preparation of road and railway projects effectively will be \nrequired. Accordingly, a project development facility (PDF) dedicated to such \nregional infrastructure projects needs to be designed and established. These are \noften more costly and complex compared to national projects in terms of project \npreparation. \n \n8.  In  addition  to  the  above,  possible  \"software\"  aspects  of  infrastructure,  knowledge \ncreation and dissemination, consensus building, and capacity development components need to \nbe identified to support the timely development and delivery of the AHN and TAR. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is expected to contribute to improving connectivity in Asia and the Pacific \nthrough integration of transport networks to support intraregional trade and regional production \nnetworks, and to gear ADB's operations toward this objective in coordination with the member \ncountries. This will also improve financing of key projects that promote regional infrastructure \nintegration  and  development,  particularly  through  the  AHN  and  TAR.  The  TA  will  be \ncomplemented by the expansion and dissemination of knowledge and the implementation of \nADB's strategic vision on regional infrastructure integration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will undertake the analysis on the key issues to support the regional transport \ndevelopment. In addition, through the TA, ADB will conduct in-depth consultations with the \nstakeholders, including UNESCAP. ADB regional departments will be consulted and requested \nto provide guidance on key issues, including the identification of projects for the AHN and TAR. \nThe consultative approach will include roundtable discussions and workshops to ensure the \ntransfer of skills and knowledge. ADB will monitor the process closely to ensure the high quality \nof outputs, including the dissemination activities. Specific outputs of the TA are described below. \n \n1.  Regional Transport Project Pipeline \n11.  The key output of the TA will be an enhanced and updated project pipeline for the AHN \nand  TAR.  This  will  require  an  updating  of  the  AHN  and  TAR  priorities,  followed  by  the \nidentification of viable projects for possible ADB financing. Thereafter, the consultants will work \nclosely with ADB regional departments to conduct a series of pre-feasibility studies. The specific \noutputs  and  outcomes  will  include:  (i)  updated  information  related  to  the  AHN  and  TAR, \nespecially  their  configuration,  to  ensure  recent  developments  in  countries\u2019  regional  trade, \nnational and subregional programs, and other relevant factors are reflected and an integrated \nregional, multimodal transport system is developed; (ii) a list of high-priority and economically \nviable road, railway, and related cross-border projects;10 (iii) a series of pre-feasibility studies to \nscreen for potential ADB-financed AHN and TAR projects; (iv) a report on the key \u2018software\u2019 \nissues; and (v) dissemination and consensus-building activities with regard to the AHN and TAR. \n                                                \n10  The priority projects will be identified based on their economic and financial viability, as well as their contribution to \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction,  and  regional  connectivity,  taking  into  account  future  trade  and  traffic \nprojections. This selection will be done in consultation with the regional departments.  \n ", "4   \n \n2.  Linkage between Trade and Transport \n12.  In  recognition  of  the  important  role  of  transport  in  regional  connectivity  and  trade \nintegration, the TA will also include an analysis of how to better link transport and trade. Starting \nwith a stock-taking exercise, the TA will develop a framework to facilitate this linkage. The focus \nwill be on transport-related logistical arrangements, rather than trade agreements, although the \nanalysis will build on the recent ADB\u2013UNESCAP activities on trade facilitation. The outputs and \noutcomes will comprise (i) a detailed analysis and stock-taking of the economic corridors, \u201cdry \nports\u201d, and other means to facilitate trade within the scope of the AHN and TAR; (ii) a time-\nbound action plan to link the operation of the AHN and TAR with trade facilitation; (iii) an \nanalysis of the regional production networks; and (iv) a series of dissemination events for \nconsensus and capacity building. This will begin with a detailed analysis and forecast on future \ntrade flows within the region, which will feed into the transport work of component 1.  \n \n3.  Establishment of a Regional Project Development Facility \n13.  For the medium term, given the significant level of investment required for the AHN and \nTAR, a mechanism to effectively fund and prepare projects is needed. This mechanism will \nrequire a set of stringent screening criteria and an operational framework. For ADB, an internal \nproject preparatory TA fund would be helpful. To catalyze private resources and those from \nother development partners, an external PDF may also be needed. Thus, both options for a \nPDF will be designed through the TA, in consultation with other stakeholders. Establishment of \nsuch a mechanism would demonstrate ADB's emphasis on regional infrastructure development, \nincluding the AHN and TAR. The outputs and outcomes are (i) a detailed design of an internal \nPDF for  regional  infrastructure  development,  (ii)  a  detailed  design of  an external  PDF for \nregional infrastructure development, (iii) a detailed analysis of public\u2013private partnerships and \nprivate financing as related to regional infrastructure development (in coordination with the ADB \nPrivate Sector Operations Department), and (iv) a series of dissemination events for consensus \nand capacity building. \n \n14.  Coordination with the subregional programs. Activities under the TA will start with a \ncomprehensive  stock-taking  of  the  corresponding activities  under  ADB\u2019s programs.  Priority \nprojects will be identified in close consultation with the regional departments and DMCs. This \napproach will maximize synergy between the proposed TA and the subregional and national \nprograms.11 \n \n15.  Emphasis on knowledge dissemination. For all components, high-quality knowledge \nproducts will be developed that will be published by ADB and elsewhere. The knowledge \nproducts will cover (i) the updated AHN and TAR concepts, priorities, and issues; (ii) the \nemergence of regional production networks, based on recent trade agreements; and (iii) the link \nbetween trade and transport, with emphasis on logistical support for facilitation. Stakeholders \nwill be consulted when drafting such knowledge products and dissemination activities will be \nheld in consultation with the ADB Department of External Relations. A small inception workshop \nis envisaged in July 2010, followed by a joint conference with UNESCAP on the AHN and TAR \nduring the fourth quarter of 2010. A series of smaller workshops arranged in coordination with \nthe regional departments will also be held.  \n                                                \n11  ADB's Office of Regional Economic Integration will also coordinate with the regional departments and resident \nmissions on any communications with DMCs. Concurrence from the concerned government will be sought if any \nTA activity is to be undertaken within a DMC. \n ", "  5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $2,175,000. The entire amount will be \nfunded on a grant basis by ADB. The equivalent of $1,100,000 will be financed by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV), the equivalent of $75,000 will be financed by \nTASF-Others, and the equivalent of $1,000,000 by the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFund12 under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by the ADB Office of \nRegional Economic Integration (OREI) with support from other ADB departments, in particular \nthe ADB Regional and Sustainable Development Department and regional departments. An \ninterdepartmental taskforce will be formed, and the community of practice on transport will be \nconsulted. Externally, ADB will coordinate closely with subregional initiatives and UNESCAP. \nThe TA is expected to be completed over 18 months from July 2010 to December 2011. \n \n18.  About 56 person-months of international consulting services and 58 person-months of \nnational consulting services are required on an intermittent basis for the three components of \nthe TA. The consultants' inputs will be based on a detailed work schedule that will be formulated \nas a part of the TA inception. Because of the diverse skills requirements, individual consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). In addition, the use of individual consultants, for the scope of this \nTA, is considered more effective and cost-efficient (based on the procedures as outlined in \nProject Administration Instruction 2.05).13 To implement the TA successfully, a team of OREI \nstaff, including one professional staff member, one national officer, and one operations assistant, \nwill  consolidate  consultants'  individual  outputs,  and  coordinate  and  administer  individual \nconsultant contracts. A team of staff members from OREI and the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department will review the outputs. The terms of reference for the consultants are \nin Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  Equipment (computer hardware and software) will be purchased in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and in coordination with \nthe  ADB  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  the  Office  of  Administrative \nServices, where applicable. After TA completion, any procured equipment will be disposed of in \ncompliance with Project Administration Instruction 5.11.14 Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (January 2008, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,175,000  on  a  grant  basis  for  Promoting  Regional \nInfrastructure Development. \n                                                \n12  Established by ADB.  \n13  ADB. 2009.
