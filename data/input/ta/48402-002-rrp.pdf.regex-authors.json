THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the additional financing of the National Motorway M-4 \nGojra\u2013Shorkot\u2013Khanewal  Section  Project. 1  The  report  also  describes  (i)  the  proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Government of the United Kingdom, and (ii) the \nproposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \n(AIIB), both for the additional financing of the National Motorway M-4 Gojra\u2013Shorkot Section \nProject, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the grant and loan for the additional financing.2 \n \n2.  The additional financing will support an increase in the scope of the current project by \nconstructing a 64-kilometer (km) four-lane, access-controlled motorway connecting Shorkot and \nKhanewal in Punjab province,3 which is the last remaining section of the national motorway M-4 \nto be constructed. The overall project will facilitate north\u2013south connectivity, improve the quality \nand efficiency of road transport services, and promote inclusive economic growth. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  primary  north\u2013south  transport  corridor  in  Pakistan  runs  from  Torkham  on  the \nnorthern border with Afghanistan and passes through primary production and population centers \nsuch  as  Peshawar,  Islamabad,  Faisalabad,  Lahore,  Khanewal,  Multan,  and  Muzaffargarh, \nbefore reaching the port city of Karachi in the south. The corridor, which is about 1,800 km long, \ncomprises national highways and motorways and connects the key centers of economic activity \nin the country. The corridor serves the economy of an area that accounts for 80%\u201385% of \nPakistan's gross domestic product (GDP) and, in the regional context, forms an integral part of \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) corridors 5 and 6. After Pakistan\u2019s \naccession to the CAREC Program in 2010, the corridors have become vital trading routes \nbetween landlocked Central Asian nations and Pakistan\u2019s warm-water ports of Gwadar, Karachi, \nand Port Qasim on the Arabian Sea. \n \n4.  The national motorway M-4, connecting Faisalabad with Multan, will be a part of the \nnorth\u2013south transport corridor. Its area of influence, which includes Faisalabad, Multan, and the \nentire Punjab province, accounts for about 56% of the country's population and for 59% of the \ncountry's GDP. The M-4 will extend the already completed M-1, M-2, and M-3 motorways \nsouthward and shorten the distance between Multan and the twin cities of Islamabad and \nRawalpindi in the north. The Faisalabad\u2013Gojra section (58 km) of the M-4 was completed in \n2014 with financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), while the Islamic Development \nBank supported the completion of the adjoining Khanewal\u2013Multan section (57 km) in 2015. Civil \nworks for the Gojra\u2013Shorkot section (62 km), cofinanced by ADB and the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom (footnote 1), commenced in April 2016. The proposed additional financing will \nbe applied to the construction of the remaining 64 km section between Shorkot and Khanewal. \nUpon completion, the new four-lane, access-controlled M-4 will provide a faster, safer, and more \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan and Administration of Grant to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the National Motorway M-4 \nGojra\u2013Shorkot Section Project. Manila. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The project is included in ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n ", "2 \ncost-effective alternative to the existing narrow and congested routes, notably in the heavily \ntrafficked Faisalabad and Khanewal\u2013Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh areas. \n \n5.  The implementation of the current project is progressing well with an on track project \nperformance rating and identified risks being appropriately managed. The project is financed by \na combined loan and grant of $270 million equivalent approved on 30 September 2015. The \nloan and grant became effective on 17 December 2015 and will close on 31 May 2020. All civil \nworks  contracts  were  awarded  on  27  December  2015.  As  effective  competition  among \ninternational and national bidders resulted in awards that were lower than the estimates, loan \nsavings  of  approximately  $50  million  were  achieved.  Both  the  construction  supervision \nconsultant and the social safeguard management consultant were mobilized in February 2016. \nThe  institutional  strengthening  component  on  safeguard  and  contract  administration  is \nprogressing well and benefiting the implementation of the project. The project is complying \nsatisfactorily with ADB safeguard policy requirements. The proposed additional financing will \nclose the remaining 64 km gap between Shorkot and Khanewal, which will enable the realizing \nof the full benefits associated with the M-4. Given the strong links with the current project in \nterms of design and implementation arrangements and also the efficiency gains in loan delivery \ntime, additional financing is deemed a suitable instrument to scale up the current project. The \nprospect  of  providing  additional  financing  had  already  been  raised  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President for the current project. All necessary due diligence has been \nconducted. The project meets ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria for additional financing as it (i) remains \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high priority by \nthe government; and (iii) is consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives and current \ncountry partnership strategy. \n \n6.  The increase in scope and the additional financing do not change the development \nobjectives  of  the  current  project.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  goals  and \ngovernment priorities.4 The transport sector in Pakistan contributes about 10% to GDP and \nemploys  about  2.3  million  people  (about  6%  of  the  active  labor  force  of  Pakistan).  Road \ntransport dominates Pakistan's transport system, accounting for almost 96% of freight traffic in \nton-kilometers and 92% of passenger traffic in passenger-kilometers. An improved north\u2013south \ncorridor will reduce the time and cost of moving goods and people along the entire logistics and \nsupply  chain.  It  will  be  instrumental  in  removing  one  of  the  key  constraints  on  raising \ncompetitiveness,  attracting  private  sector  investment,  increasing  productivity,  as  well  as \ndeepening and diversifying the industrial base. The project will thus go a long way toward \nproviding sustainable jobs to a growing population. The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2015\u20132019  for  Pakistan;5 fits  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy 2020;6 supports the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020;7 and is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Pakistan (footnote 3). \n  \n7.  Regardless of the absolute amounts involved in ADB\u2019s financial assistance to Pakistan, \nthe scope of the assistance is relatively insignificant compared to the country\u2019s substantial \nfinancing needs for the development of its transport infrastructure. ADB has, therefore, been \nactive in seeking additional resources to complement its own. This includes securing in June \n2015 a grant contribution of \u00a3262 million over 2015\u20132020 from the Government of the United \nKingdom for the development of the Pakistan Economic Corridors Program.

In addition, ADB and AIIB are working to conclude a cofinancing \nagreement,  based  on  which  the  infrastructure  needs  of  motorway  M-4  will  be  met.  The \nadditional non-ADB resources will, jointly with ADB\u2019s own efforts, support Pakistan Vision 2025 \n(footnote 4), the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020, and ADB\u2019s strategic \nobjectives. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact and outcome for the overall project will remain unchanged from those for the \ncurrent project. The impact will be the modernization of transportation infrastructure and greater \nregional connectivity to support a vibrant and growing economy, as highlighted in Pakistan \nVision 2025. The outcome will be an efficient and safer transport corridor between Islamabad, \nFaisalabad, and Multan that enhances the connectivity between the various parts of the country. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The proposed additional financing will enable the expansion of the project outputs. The \nincremental outputs will be that 64 km of four-lane, access-controlled motorway connecting \nShorkot and Khanewal is constructed and serviceable.8 \n \nD.

The additional financing does not entail any changes in the existing implementation \narrangements.  The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  remains  the  executing  agency.  The \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  under  the  NHA\u2014which  is  implementing  the  M-4  Gojra\u2013\nShorkot section and has suitably qualified staff, including project directors, engineers, and \nfinancial and safeguard specialists\u2014will also be responsible for day-to-day management of the \nadditional financing. The activities financed by the additional financing do not require additional \ncapacity at the PIU. \n \n14.  All procurement financed under the ADB loan, including the ADB-administered loan and \ngrant, will follow international competitive bidding procedures pursuant to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s prior review. As the project will be \ncofinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom and AIIB and administered by ADB, \nuniversal procurement will be applied.10 The consulting firm Renardet SA Ing\u00e9nieurs Conseils, \nwhich has been recruited under the current project, will also provide construction supervision \nservices for civil works under the additional financing. \n \n15.  Advance actions in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines have been taken to facilitate \nproject  implementation.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n16.  The engineering of the civil works for motorway M-4 is based on pertinent guidelines, \nstandards,  and  specifications.12 Project  design  elements  mitigate  expected  climate  risks, \nincluding storms, flooding, and high ambient temperature during summer.13 A road safety audit \nof the design was conducted and a further safety audit will be carried out after completion of the \ncivil  works  to  ensure  that  the  designed  standards  are  fully  realized  and  conform  to  best \ninternational practices. Road safety features such as motorway signage, emergency parking \nareas, acceleration and deceleration lanes, reflectorized lane markings, rumble strips, antiglare \narrangements, and arrangements for driving in fog were incorporated in the design.14 \n  \n17.  The motorway M-4 envisages a toll collection system, an emergency call service for \nmotorists, and a centralized operation center with closed-circuit TV system. Similar to other \noperational motorways, the NHA will outsource the toll collection operation and maintenance \n(O&M) to the private sector. The National Highways and Motorways Police, a specialized unit \ncreated  for  the  federal  road  network,  will  enforce  traffic  and  safety  regulations  and  laws, \nincluding those applicable to vehicle overloading, speeding, and other violations. The creation of \nthis unit has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of accidents on the motorways. \nOverall, the operation, management, and maintenance of motorways in Pakistan are deemed \nefficient and effective. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n18.  The economic evaluation of the project was carried out assuming the completion of the \nentire M-4 corridor and was undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic \nAnalysis of Projects.15 The project has an economic internal rate of return of 13.6%, and a net \npresent value of PRs4.87 billion at a 12.0% discount rate. The two calculated benefits are \n(i) vehicle  operating  costs  (65.8%  of  total  benefits),  and  (ii)  time  savings  (34.2%  of  total \nbenefits). The upgrading from an unsegregated two-lane road to a segregated four-lane road \nwith restricted access ramps is likely to yield a considerable safety dividend. However, lack of \nsufficient data makes it impossible to estimate the road safety benefits. The estimated rate of \nreturn on the project is, therefore, considered conservative and the project is economically \nviable. \n \n19.  The  Road  Maintenance  Fund\u2014a  pool  of  toll  revenues,  penalties,  and  other  funds \nprovided by the government and established in 2003 through road maintenance account rules\u2014\nis earmarked to finance O&M of the entire national highway network. The project road will be \ntolled after opening to traffic. Over the project life span, the forecast toll revenue will be sufficient \nto cover O&M of the project road, contributing an additional 2.5% to the NHA\u2019s annual O&M \n                                                \n12 By the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and the Pakistan Code of Highway \nBridges. \n13 The road embankment is sufficiently high (3\u20134 m on average, increasing to 5\u20136 m near underpasses and drainage \nstructures, and 6\u20137 m near bridges) to withstand the sheet flows of the highest floods. The design provides \nadequate cross-drainage structures and hydraulic structures over perennial water channels as well as canals and \nrivers. The design of these structures took into account flood levels of 100-year recurrence interval. The impact of \ntemperature on asphaltic pavement layers is mitigated by adopting pavement specifications suitable for the climate \nin the project area\u2014mean maximum temperature of 41oC in summer and minimum temperature of 4oC in winter. \n14 Road signs and lane markings regulate traffic flow safely, while rumble strips and antiglare arrangements minimize \naccidents and road fatalities. \n15 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \nbudget. In line with the annual maintenance plan generated by the road asset management \nsystem,  the  motorway  is  a  top  priority  for  O&M  fund  allocation.  Nevertheless,  resources \ngenerated by the Road Maintenance Fund are chronically short (by about 40%\u201350%) of the \nunconstrained demand to maintain the roads at established quality levels.16 Encouragingly, road \nmaintenance account receipts have significantly increased. Moreover, the NHA committed to \nstrengthen its financial performance on the national highway network by rationalizing its toll \nrates (the current tariff of about PRs1.24 per passenger car/km is considered one of the lowest \nglobally), and expand and implement more viable toll-based projects. The strategic capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance for the transport sector in Pakistan17 included the preparation \nof a detailed action plan for implementing the restructuring of the NHA\u2019s balance sheet. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  The proposed additional financing will not require changes in the financial management \narrangements. Financial management functions under the proposed additional financing will \nremain the responsibility of the PIU, as under the current project. The NHA\u2019s capacity for \nprocurement and financial management, and for implementing the project, was assessed and \nfound to be sufficient to manage international procurement and to maintain the accounting \nsystems, financial controls, and audit arrangements. Its financial accounting, auditing rules, and \ninternal control systems follow generally accepted international practices. The NHA maintains \nseparate project records and accounts adequate to identify the works, goods, and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the \nproject, and use of local funds, including adequate internal controls and financial reporting \narrangements. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in \naccordance with national and international auditing standards by the auditor general of Pakistan \nand by a chartered accountant. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  The national poverty rate of 33% is marked by urban\u2013rural disparity (18% urban and \n46% rural poverty incidence), and 21% of the population lives below the extreme poverty line. \nPunjab province (where the project is situated) is among the least-poor provinces in Pakistan \nwith a poverty incidence of 19%, an urban rate of 10%, and a rural rate of 28%. Within the \nprovince,  however,  poverty  levels  are  uneven\u2014the  southern  part  has  an  above-average \nincidence compared with a relatively lower incidence observed in the northern districts. The \nproject alignment passes through three districts of central Punjab\u2014Toba Tek Singh, with a \npoverty headcount index of 10%; Jhang at 26%; and Khanewal at 28% (2012). The local \n                                                \n16  The NHA is currently calculating the unconstrained road maintenance needs mainly based on the assumption of \ntargeting average international roughness index indicators (e.g., 4 m/km) for its entire national highway network. \nSome of the national highways with high international roughness index indicators (about 10 m/km or above) are no \nlonger maintainable. Those roads should be prioritized for capital investment projects rather than maintenance \nneeds. Examples of such roads are in the recently approved ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Post-Flood National \nHighways Rehabilitation Project. Manila. The NHA continues to tackle those roads with a high level of disrepair \nseparately and, with the continuous growth of toll revenues, it is expected that the shortfall between the actual \nmaintenance funds and the unconstrained needs will be much smaller by 2020. \n17 ADB.  2015.  Technical  Assistance  for  Enabling  Economic  Corridors  through  Sustainable  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment. Manila. \n ", "8 \npopulation, transport operators, freight forwarders, and those trading in agricultural products will \nbenefit directly from the project, as better connectivity through the M-4 will enable access to \nmarkets countrywide and, thus, lead to better socioeconomic networking and easier access to \nhealth, education, and social facilities.  \n \n23.  The project design will boost the connectivity of inhabitants along both sides of the M-4 \nand improve road safety by inclusion of traffic signs, markings, fencing, underpasses, and \ncontrolled exit and entry traffic at interchanges. This will produce several other benefits such as \nlower transportation costs,  shorter travel times, and shorter shipment times for edible and \nperishable agricultural products, all of which will ultimately contribute to sustainable economic \ngrowth. Diversion of freight and intercity traffic from existing highways to the project motorway \nwill reduce congestion and aid traffic flow, and boost the safety of local communities in the area. \nDuring construction, the local population will benefit from short-duration jobs, and opportunities \nto sell food and goods to construction workers. The roadside rest areas with amenities for both \ngenders will allow the local population to sell produce, food, and drinks to travelers. \n \n24.  During and after implementation, regionwide population movements across the project \nareas are expected and may increase the risk of human trafficking. Such risk will be mitigated \nby  conducting  awareness  campaigns  targeting  workers  and  local  populations  during \nimplementation.  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  conduct  these  campaigns,  under  the \noversight of the construction supervision consultant and the NHA, and such requirement will be \nincluded in the bid documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  Environment. Since the M-4 alignment passes through undisturbed agricultural land, \nand given the large scale of the operation, both the current project and the additional financing \nhave been categorized A for environment. In 2007, as required by ADB\u2019s Environment Policy,18 \nan environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was prepared and approved for the entire M-\n4. Subsequently, the EIA report was updated to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and new national legal requirements, and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \nin August 2015 at the time of processing of the current project. The EIA has been further \nupdated in 2016 to incorporate additional environmental baseline information, environmental \nmanagement costs, new public consultations, and other pertinent details and data for the Gojra\u2013\nKhanewal section. This updated EIA  has been approved by ADB and the Government of \nPakistan and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 12 April 2016. The project design has factored in \nclimate change risks and adaptation measures as well as community concerns. \n \n26.  The environmental impacts identified are largely concentrated in the construction phase. \nSoil erosion, dust, and noise impacts are likely to be significant. Noise impacts will persist into \nthe  operational  phase.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  includes  measures  to \nminimize  anticipated  impacts  during  construction  and  operation.  Prior  to  construction, \ncontractors will update the EMP into a site-specific EMP. The site-specific EMP will be based on \na risk assessment approach to select impact- and site-appropriate mitigation measures such as \nbarriers for construction and operational noise. The construction supervision consultant, the \nEnvironment, Afforestation, Land, and Social Division of the NHA, and ADB will closely monitor \nthe implementation of the site-specific EMP. The NHA will submit semiannual environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB for disclosure on the ADB website.  \n \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2002.

The  additional  financing  is  classified  category  A  for \ninvoluntary resettlement since it involves the acquisition of 622.2 hectares of private land that \nwill impact on 3,429 households (23,186 displaced people). Of these people, 2,754 will lose \nmore than  10%  of their  productive  land  and 162  households  with  1,302 members  will  be \nphysically displaced. The NHA has prepared and submitted to ADB the final land acquisition \nand resettlement plan (LARP) based on the completed detailed design. An independent land \nvaluation study has confirmed that compensation rates for affected land are reflective of full \nreplacement cost. The LARP was disclosed on ADB's website on 20 January 2016. Public \nconsultation and information disclosure were undertaken while preparing the LARP, including \nwith displaced people and the communities along the project road. Consultation and information \nsharing will continue throughout project implementation. \n \n28.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are  progressing  well  with  a  target  of \ncompletion by the third quarter of 2016. Resettlement is being managed and implemented by \nthe NHA, through the PIU, and supported by the Environment, Afforestation, Land, and Social \nDivision.  The  PIU  has  demonstrated  capacity  for  implementing  involuntary  resettlement.  A \nfunctioning  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established.  The  social  safeguard \nmanagement consultant was mobilized on 15 February 2016 to assist the PIU in completing the \ncompensation payments, information disclosure, consultation activities, grievance redress, and \ninternal  monitoring  for  both  the  Gojra\u2013Shorkot  section  and  Shorkot\u2013Khanewal  section.  A \nqualified and experienced external monitoring agency is being recruited to verify the executing \nagency's monitoring reports, monitor LARP implementation, identify issues, and recommend \ncorrective measures. \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The additional financing is classified category C since the project \nroad is located in the settled areas of Punjab province, where no indigenous peoples, as defined \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, reside. No indigenous communities will be affected \nby the project and, accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The project procurement classification is \ncategory B. Overall, the risks are deemed manageable by adopting mitigating measures, and \nthe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak financing  The practice of providing loans to the NHA to finance its development program \narrangements on  since the creation of the NHA in 1991 undermines the authority\u2019s financial \ndevelopment and  standing.

ASSURANCES \n \n31.  The government and the NHA have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents.
