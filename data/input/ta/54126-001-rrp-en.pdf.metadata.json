I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $55,000,000 to Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) for Kochi Metro Extension Project in India. \nThe report also describes the proposed administration of a loan of up to $50,000,000 to be provided \nby the Leading Asia's Private Infrastructure Fund, also known as \u201cLeading Asia\u2019s Private Sector \nInfrastructure Fund\u201d (LEAP),1 and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loan. \n \n2.  The project entails the extension of the existing 25.16 kilometers (km) of metro rail (built in \nphase 1) in Kochi, in India's state of Kerala in a phased manner, comprising (i) phase 1A from \nPetta\u2014the phase 1 terminal station\u2014to S.N Junction, for a length of 2.0 km; and (ii) phase 1B from \nS.N Junction to Tripunithura, where the metro rail connects to the existing long-distance railway \nstation, for a length of 1.2 km. The project will improve mobility, livability, and the urban environment \nby supporting the provision of a clean, safe, disaster-resilient, and inclusive transport system. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n3.  Project identification. An inclusive and sustainable urban transport system is critical for \nthe smooth functioning of cities. India\u2019s National Urban Transport Policy in 2006 projected an \nincrease in the country\u2019s urban population from about 285 million in 2001 to about 473 million in \n2021, and 805 million in 2050.2 This rapid urbanization led to a sharp increase in traffic\u2014between \n2009 and 2019, the number of registered vehicles grew at a compound annual rate of 9.9%3\u2014and \nseverely constrained urban road capacity, resulting in heavy congestion and air pollution, and \ncompromised  road  safety.  The  Government  of  India  committed  to  improve  the  situation  by \nimplementing its urban transport policy (footnote 2), which prioritizes sustainable public transport. \nAs of 31 March 2021, more than 700 km of metro railway networks are operational in 18 cities \nacross India. An additional 1,010 km are under construction, including in nine more cities.4 The \nMetro Rail Policy (2017) lays down guidelines and norms for the metro rail development that cater \nto passenger services in a large urban agglomerate or metropolitan area.5 \n \n4.  Kochi is the largest and most densely populated city in Kerala, and is often called the \neconomic capital since its industrial and financial activities are driving Kerala's economy. According \nto the 2011 census, the city alone had a population of 677,000, while the greater metropolitan area \nnumbered 2.1 million. The state's transport infrastructure consists of about 273,000 km of road; \n1,588 km of railways; 1,687 km of inland waterways; 18 ports; and 25,449 buses. 6 During peak \nhours, some of these services are heavily saturated. \n \n5.  Project  design.  The  metro  rail  system  in  Kochi  is  operated  by  KMRL,  which  was \nincorporated in 2011 to develop and operate nonmotorized public transport projects in the city. The \nGovernment of India and Kerala each own 50% of shares in KMRL.

The project entails an extension of phase 1: \nphases 1A and 1B (para. 2). (Confidential information deleted.)  \n \n6.  Borrower and guarantor. For fiscal year (FY) 2020, KMRL reported revenue of \u20b9940 \nmillion, an increase of 17% from \u20b9801 million in FY2019. Net loss was \u20b93,098 million in FY2020, \n9% higher than \u20b92,849 million in FY2019. As of 31 March 2020, KMRL\u2019s total equity was \u20b923.3 \nbillion, and short- and long-term borrowings were \u20b932.4 billion. Net losses are currently being \nincurred, because after commissioning of phase 1, passenger numbers had not yet stabilized when \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic struck. (Confidential information deleted.) Kerala \nhas the 11th highest gross state domestic product in India. The state also has the ninth highest per \ncapita income in the country\u2014about 1.6 times the national average. The state government is \ninternationally rated BB- by Standard & Poor\u2019s7 and BB by Fitch Ratings.8 \n \n7.  Corporate governance and state-owned enterprise reform. Key constraints which public \ntransportation projects face include ensuring financial sustainability while maintaining affordable \nticket prices and high quality of service to enable modal shift. Commercial financing is normally not \ncontemplated for such projects as the need to keep tickets affordable leads to farebox revenues \nnot  being  adequate  to  service  such  loans,  leading  to  significant\u2014and  occasionally   \nunsustainable\u2014dependence on subsidies to meet debt service. KMRL had therefore financed \nphase 1 by a traditional sovereign guaranteed loan from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. \nHowever, for the phase 1A and 1B extension, KMRL decided to borrow commercially, to minimize \ndependence on limited state government\u2019s sovereign guarantee headroom that could be utilized \nfor more pressing, developmental projects. (Confidential information deleted.) Since both KMRL \nand  the  state  government  have  to  comply  with  stringent  financial  covenants  (Confidential \ninformation deleted.), the proposed loan will impose meaningful financial and fiscal discipline on \nthe borrower and the guarantor\u2014aimed at sustained financial reform over the loan life.  \n \n8.  Borrowing on a nonsovereign basis from ADB, and going through the intensive financial, \nlegal and credit due diligence will also enable KMRL to build capacity to raise market-based finance \nfor its future capital expenditure, aimed at reducing financial dependence on the state government. \nFinancial structuring of the proposed loan, and reporting and disclosure requirements are similar \nto those for a private sector entity, which will require KMRL to enhance its corporate governance. \nIn addition, through extensive engagement with KMRL, in partnership with South Asia Department \n(SARD), best in class environmental and social (E&S) standards, and robust gender related \naspects, have been included in project design, compliance with which will lead to meaningful \ncapacity building. \n \n9.  COVID-19  impact.  With  the  outbreak  of  COVID-19  and  the  consequent  lockdown \nmeasures,  KMRL  had  to  suspend  its  operations  from  24  March  to  7  September  2020. \n(Confidential information deleted.)

The project impact is aligned with the Government of India\u2019s Metro Rail Policy 2017, \nwhich targets improvements to public transport in Indian cities by implementing mass transit \nsystems (footnote 5). \n \n13.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: operations of clean mass transport \nsystem expanded. \n \n14.  Outputs. The outputs of the project are (i) disaster-resilient Kochi metro rail expanded, \n(ii) gender-inclusive  local  employment  generated,  and  (iii) gender  inclusiveness  of  stations \nenhanced. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with four \nof the seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities; (ii) making cities more livable; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate \nand disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (iv) accelerating progress \nin gender equality.9 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 \nfor India, specifically pillar 2: providing inclusive access to infrastructure networks and social \nservices by improving the infrastructure bottlenecks in lagging regions.10 \n \n16.  Consistency with sector strategy and related ADB operations. The project is consistent \nwith two elements of ADB's Sustainable Transport Initiative: scaling up urban transport, and \naddressing climate change in transport.11 \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n17.  (Confidential information deleted.) \n \n18.  Table 2 identifies the corresponding sources of funds. \n \n19.  Climate change adaptation and mitigation. The climate change assessment revealed \nmedium overall risk for the project. Kochi is projected to experience increasingly higher average \ntemperatures and an increasing occurrence of extreme weather events. The project includes \nmodern design and technology, such as stack effect ventilation on station roofs to create airflow. \nTo minimize flooding, the plinth level of the network is set above high-flood levels, and the retention \ncapacity of existing storm drains is augmented. (Confidential information deleted.) The project will \ncontribute to climate change mitigation because it will result in a modal shift from road to rail, which \nis a cleaner mode of transport. Hence, the entire $105 million of ADB financing (including from \nLEAP) is eligible for climate financing\u2014primarily mitigation with a small amount for adaptation. \n \nE.

This project is the first nonsovereign transaction jointly processed by ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department (PSOD) and SARD in the transport sector in India and is categorized as a \nOne ADB collaboration.12 SARD and PSOD jointly identified the project and leveraged their \nrespective areas of expertise. SARD was engaged in sector policy dialogue and provided technical \nassistance on safeguard due diligence and financial modeling. PSOD is primarily responsible for \nfinancial structuring and commercial due diligence. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n23.  ADB\u2019s assistance will comprise (i) a loan of up to $55 million, and (ii) administration of a loan \nof up to $50 million from LEAP. (Confidential information deleted.) \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n24.  Financial  additionality.  Metro  rail  projects  in  India  have  been  largely  financed  by \nsovereign-backed  loans  from  development  financial  institutions,  or  public  sector  banks.  The \nnonsovereign loan from ADB will expand KMRL\u2019s funding sources, and have a demonstration effect \nto help reduce the risk perception of such projects (particularly the expansion of existing networks) \nand build confidence in the market. This will attract both domestic and international financiers to \nthe sector. ADB also mobilized meaningful commercial cofinancing from LEAP for the project. \n \n25.  Nonfinancial additionality. ADB\u2019s engagement will improve KMRL\u2019s institutional capacity. \nInvolvement in the processing of the nonsovereign loan, such as in due diligence and commercial \nnegotiations, gave KMRL the opportunity to familiarize itself with the process of raising finance on \na commercial basis, which will help it adopt a sustainable, market-based approach to the funding \nof future capital expenditure. In addition, compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) will result in the project adopting internationally recognized E&S standards that are not \nrequired under domestic laws. ADB\u2019s involvement also contributes to enhancing gender-sensitive \nplanning to ensure that women have access to metro services that are better tailored to their needs.  \n \nC.  Risks \n26.

Manila. \n ", "5 \n31.  (Confidential information deleted.) \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n32.  ADB categorized the investment in compliance with its Safeguard Policy Statement as \nfollows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category B), and indigenous peoples \n(category C).13 \n \n33.  ADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the potential E&S impacts of the project, and \nthe measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for them, as discussed in the safeguard \nreports and plans. Independent and qualified consultants conducted an E&S compliance audit, an \ninitial environmental and social examination (IESE) for phases 1A and 1B, and a social compliance \naudit (SCA) with a focus on state government-led land acquisition, compensation, and labor \npractices. The E&S measures, and the institutional capacity and commitment of KMRL to manage \nthe  project\u2019s  E&S  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  The  institutional  capacity  will  be  further \nstrengthened to ensure that management systems and resources are in place to implement the \nagreed actions and ascertain compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and other social \nrequirements. \n \n34.  Environmental safeguards. Key construction environmental impacts and risks include \nnoise and vibration, dust, potential damage to cultural heritage assets, danger to health and safety, \ndeterioration  of  surface  water  bodies,  increased  traffic,  and  solid  and  liquid  waste.  During \noperations, key environmental impacts will include noise and public safety risks. Environment, \nhealth, and safety (EHS) risks during construction are managed through the project\u2019s construction \nEHS management plans and procedures, with standard mitigation measures for the anticipated \nconstruction EHS impacts. Based on the findings of ADB\u2019s assessment, the management plans \nwill be strengthened to ensure compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n35.  A noise model was developed for the project\u2019s operations and is presented in the IESE. The \nmodel assumed a worst-case scenario and identified minor exceedance of the relevant guidelines \nat three locations. KMRL has embedded noise and vibration control measures in the project\u2019s \ndesign and will commit to implementing additional measures to minimize noise impacts during \noperations. These commitments will be incorporated into the environmental management plan. \n \n36.  A segment of the project passes through Champakara Canal (adjacent and in parallel to an \nexisting bridge), which is connected to the aquatic habitats of the Vembanad Kol Wetlands, a \nRamsar site.14 The construction methods used and the design of the segment that crosses the \ncanal were optimized to minimize disturbance to the flow of water in the canal. Further, impacts on \nthe Ramsar site are not expected to be significant since the project segment lies within Kochi City, \nwhich  is  highly  urbanized.  Anticipated  residual  impacts  are  addressed  through  measures \nincorporated in the project environmental management plan. \n \n37.  Significant effort went into the project\u2019s alignment design to avoid religious structures. \nHowever, some community property resources, including temples and statues, were found to be \nwithin the project\u2019s right-of-way in phase 1A. The main structures were not affected, and KMRL \ncompensated reductions in lot size and losses of minor assets such as parking spaces and \nboundary walls. The properties maintain the same functionality as before the project impact. \n \n13 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n14 The Ramsar Convention Secretariat.

The SCA of prior actions \nfor phase 1A land acquisition and planned activities for phase 1B assessed compliance with \nnational and local legal requirements, and the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement\u2014\nSafeguard Requirement 2 (involuntary resettlement) and Safeguard Requirement 3 (indigenous \npeoples). For both phases, land is being acquired by the state government on behalf of KMRL. \nPhase 1A land acquisition has been assessed as undertaken not in anticipation of ADB loan and \ntherefore national and state legislation was applied. Phase 1B land is being acquired during the \ntenor of the loan and the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements will apply in addition to state \nand national laws. The audit found that the land acquisition is being carried out in line with legal \nrequirements and is broadly aligned with the requirements of Safeguard Requirement 2. The \ngovernment process includes a detailed social impact assessment (SIA); various compensation \nentitlements which, when combined, met the principle of compensation at full replacement cost; \ncash compensation for losses to livelihoods; consultation and disclosure at various steps, including \npublic input to the design to minimize impacts; and public access to a government-managed \ngrievance resolution process. Gaps were found\u2014e.g., lack of attention to gender in the process, \nlack of involvement of KMRL in the grievance redress process, and inadequate compensation paid \nto several economically displaced commercial property renters and employees\u2014and assessed as \npotentially creating project-induced vulnerability. KMRL has developed a Livelihood Restoration \nPlan for phase 1A to address livelihoods related gaps in phase 1A land acquisition which has been \ndisclosed in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements and developed with appropriate \n \nmeaningful consultation with affected people. \n \n39.  The state government will undertake land acquisition and compensation for phase 1B once \nthe SIA for phase 1B is finalized; a draft SIA is currently under review by KMRL. KMRL will be \nrequired to submit to ADB a Resettlement Plan for Phase 1B related to land acquisition prior to any \nimpacts occurring as a result of Phase 1B land acquisition. \n \n40.  The SCA found that the land acquisition for phase 1A affected 399 households or 1,356 \nindividuals. Of these, 27 individuals experienced physical displacement or loss of more than 10% \nof productive assets. For phase 1B, for which the land acquisition legal process has only just begun, \nthe  draft  SIA  indicates  that  126  individuals  will  be  affected  through  physical  and  economic \ndisplacement; this will be verified during the census and asset inventory, which is yet to be \nundertaken. Given that the total number of displaced individuals is not expected to exceed 200 \nindividuals, the project\u2019s total involuntary resettlement impacts are deemed not to be significant and \nin line with the criteria for involuntary resettlement category B safeguards. \n \n41.  The project is based in a dense urban area where various ethnic groups reside together but \nwith individual property attachments. The audit and IESE found that very few people in the project \narea could be identified as belonging to scheduled tribes, and that these were part of the broader \nurban community with no attachment to communal resources, rights, or claims based on their \nidentity. Safeguard Requirement 3 is not triggered for phases 1A and 1B. \n \n42.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), KMRL incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nin its business, including (i) child-feeding booths and diaper-changing tables at new metro stations, \n(ii) station noticeboards for third parties to communicate support services for survivors of gender-\nbased violence, (iii) a corporate gender policy developed and implemented, and (iv) technical \ninternships for women. KMRL will submit periodic reports to ADB. \n \n43.  KMRL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \n ", "7 \nstandards. KMRL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with such \nlaws, and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will \nfollow ADB requirements.15 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  KMRL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n45.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single exposure \nlimits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n46.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),16 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of India has \nno  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  KMRL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$55,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Kochi Metro Rail Limited for the Kochi Metro \nExtension Project in India, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n13 September 2021 \n \n15 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 ADB. 1966.
