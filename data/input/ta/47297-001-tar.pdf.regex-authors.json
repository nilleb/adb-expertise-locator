INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  activities  under  the  technical  assistance  (TA)1  will  support  the \nimplementation of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). A key objective of the Safeguard Policy Statement is to help ADB\u2019s borrowers and/or \nclients strengthen their capacity to manage social and environmental risks. The TA will build on \nthe Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems Project, which sought to support \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in addressing the impacts of involuntary resettlement \ncaused by development projects.2 Specifically, this TA will follow up the project\u2019s efforts to \nprioritize institutional strengthening and capacity development of government institutions and \nagencies, civil society organizations, and/or other stakeholder groups in applying involuntary \nresettlement safeguards. Under the project, a number of DMCs have expressed strong demand \nfor further capacity building support on involuntary resettlement safeguard application. A design \nand monitoring framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since ADB adopted its first policy on involuntary resettlement in 1995, land acquisition \nand resettlement have become increasingly important in planning and delivering ADB projects. \nSocial safeguards have become a crucial part of project planning, including comprehensive \nproject-level consultation processes that not only influence project designs, but also enhance \nbenefit sharing and ensure inclusion of project-affected people. While the effectiveness of ADB-\nsupported projects has substantially improved as a result of attention to involuntary resettlement \nsafeguards, some borrowers and/or clients have expressed concern that the cost of applying \nADB\u2019s safeguards has become too high. ADB has been seeking ways to address this concern. \nThus, in updating its Safeguard Policy Statement in 2009, ADB included a commitment to help \nDMCs strengthen their safeguard systems to reduce the transaction costs associated with \napplying involuntary resettlement safeguards. \n \n3.  DMCs\u2019  ability  to  apply  involuntary  resettlement  safeguards  has  not  often  been \ncomplemented  by  the  use  of  available  technological  innovations  in  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT). These innovations have the potential to make assessing and \nplanning of mitigation measures to involuntary resettlement risks and impacts more thorough \nand cost-effective. This applies, in particular, to the practices in social impact assessment, \ndetailed  measurement  survey,  and  inventory  of  losses,  among  others,  which  are  done  to \ndetermine the scope and cost of land acquisition and resettlement. The project sponsor is \nrequired to accurately ascertain impacts within the project footprint or corridor, including the \nnumber of affected persons to be relocated and/or compensated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Unsystematic assessment and data storage techniques are often \nsources of inefficiencies and bottlenecks for project implementation. Planning errors caused by \nthese techniques pose a risk not only to ADB\u2019s reputation, but also to achieving project results. \nSpecifically, manual survey preparation and delivery have serious drawbacks such as poor \nhandwriting, incomplete forms, and transcription errors that affect the accuracy of collected data \nand reliability of results. Furthermore, project proponents have to deal with inconsistent data \nand reports that, for lack of proper storage and retrieval systems, cannot be easily verified \nduring later stages of project implementation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 October 2014.  \n2  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems. Manila (TA 7566-\nREG, $9,000,000, approved on 26 July). \n ", "2 \n \n4.  During  project  implementation,  implementing  agencies  are  often  unable  to  find  or \nusefully access raw socioeconomic and social impact assessment survey data collected during \nthe feasibility study stage. Without this information, agencies have to re-enumerate displaced \npeople during the detailed design stage\u2014meaning baseline data have to be reconstructed to \nenable project planners to fully address the impacts on assets, shelter, and livelihoods. At the \ndetailed design stage, the resettlement plan is finalized for implementation and basic data for \nfuture assessment of the post-resettlement status of displaced persons are established. When \nsuch  data  is  collected  and  stored  using  available  ICT  applications  (e.g.,  Droidsurvey, \nSnapsurvey,  and  Dooblo),  it  is  possible  to  avoid  project  delays  and  keep  the  cost  of \nresettlement planning and implementation manageable.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The proposed TA seeks to overcome inefficiencies discussed above. It will design, \ndevelop, and pilot-test the Involuntary Resettlement: Field Integrated Review and Standardized \nTool (IR-FIRST).3 The tool will be pilot-tested in ADB projects undergoing preparatory TA in the \nPhilippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam in 2016.4 ADB will request DMCs to endorse the TA. The \nTA  will  use  up-to-date  electronic  ICT  tools,  or  e-tools,  that  maximize  developments  in \ngeographical information systems and mobile devices, such as tablets for collecting and storing \nresettlement planning-related data.  \n \n6.  The TA rationale is that the use of e-tools to collect and store information is more \naccurate and less costly than current paper-based methods. While efficiencies are expected to \naccrue  from  substantial  time  and  cost  savings  and  improved  reliable  procedures  in  the \nenumeration of affected persons, the TA\u2019s priority will be project-displaced persons. The tool will \nbe designed to complement (not replace) face-to-face community consultations by specialists, \nwhich  are  essential  for  meaningful  consultation.  Although  mainly  aimed  at  collecting  and \nanalyzing quantitative involuntary resettlement-related information, the tool will meaningfully \nmanage limited qualitative information collection through short-answer questions. Overall, it is \nexpected that the pilot will lead to better project efficiency and inclusiveness, resulting from \nsound involuntary resettlement safeguards planning and implementation. \n \n7.  The TA impact will be enhanced effectiveness and inclusiveness of ADB-supported \nprojects. The outcome will be completed cost-effective and implementation-ready resettlement \nplans.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will achieve the above outcome by two concurrent outputs. First, the TA will \ndevelop and field validate a master set of standardized involuntary resettlement survey forms, \ndata reports, and the IR-FIRST tool. Second, knowledge products and learning tools will be \ndeveloped, designed, and disseminated so that staff from the executing and implementing \nagencies and other involuntary resettlement stakeholders (including ADB staff) can gain greater \n                                                 \n3  A diagram showing the IR-FIRST concept is shown in the Concept Overview (Supplementary Appendix). \n4 The Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam have, or are in the process of, establishing safeguards centers of \nexcellence and/or have already undertaken significant work in involuntary resettlement e-surveys and management \ninformation systems development in a relevant sector. The TA will link with projects identified during the design \nstage, based on demand from ADB teams. ADB safeguard specialists and some mission leaders and government \nexecuting agencies have expressed high preliminary interest to be involved in the pilot. \n ", "3 \n \nunderstanding of relevant ICT approaches for involuntary resettlement document preparation, \nand improve their capacity to apply the piloted tool. \n \n9.  The TA will source and calibrate an off-the-shelf e-survey package to enable the conduct \nof standardized surveys in selected ADB-funded transport and urban sectors projects in the \nPhilippines,  Viet  Nam,  and  Sri  Lanka,  using  mobile  devices  during  the  feasibility  study \npreparation or project preparatory TA, with an understanding (and flexible design) that it will \neventually be used in later project cycle stages (such as detailed design and project evaluation), \nother sectors, and other DMCs. The TA will develop appropriate metrics to measure the e-tool\u2019s \ncomparative advantage to existing methods of data collection, storage, and reporting.  \n \n10.  A technical advisory team (TAT) consisting of ADB social safeguard specialists and \nproject team leaders will set criteria for selecting suitable projects in the transport and urban \ndevelopment sectors in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam for e-tool pilot testing. The \noutputs will be targeted for use in transport- and urban-sector projects as these typically involve \nsignificant  involuntary  resettlement.  Major  assumptions  for  generating  the  outputs  are  that \nexecuting and implementing agencies and other stakeholders will actively take part in the pilot, \nare receptive to the use of e-survey processes, and have no restrictions on geo-location or \nstorage  of  survey  data.  These  aspects,  together  with  potential  concerns  about  intellectual \nproperty rights and how they can be managed, will form part of the pilot test\u2019s overall feasibility \nanalysis.5   \n \n11.  To mitigate the risk reflected in the assumption, the TA will develop a clear set of criteria \nfor selecting executing and implementing agencies that can benefit most from using IR-FIRST. It \nwill be important to survey the results of similar TA projects that have supported executing \nagencies in developing computer-based management information systems.6 These agencies \ncould be ready to scale up their systems to more modern ICT and mobile-based applications. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The associated governments are not \nexpected to provide any resources except for their in-kind contributions during field-testing. No \nactivity will be financed in any participating DMC unless a no-objection letter is obtained from \nthe  government  of  that  DMC.  Details  of  the  cost  estimate  are  in  Appendix  2.  All  TA \ndisbursements, including those related to the procurement and disposal of equipment, will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, from January 2015 to December 2016. ADB, \nthrough the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, will be the executing agency \nfor the TA. The department will lead the overall TA implementation in collaboration with the \n                                                 \n5 Limited intellectual property rights for the TA-developed portion of IR-FIRST will be secured as part of the \nThpero vciuerwems eenxt.p  ressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n6m  AeDmBb.e 2r0s0, 5B. oTaercdh noifc Dali rAescstiostrasn, cMe aton athgee Dmeemnot,c orart isct aSfof,c iaanlisdt  mReapyu bbelic p orfe Slimri iLnaanrkya i nfo rn tahteu rCea. p acity Building of the \nEnvironmental and Social Division of the Road Development Authority.

Selected  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  ADB  investment \nprojects in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam will collaborate in pilot-testing IR-FIRST. To \nsupport  capacity-building  activities,  the  TA  will  collaborate  with  centers  of  excellence  in \nsafeguards in  the  Philippines,  Sri Lanka,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  center  of  excellence  for  the \nPhilippines is housed in the University of the Philippines, and for Viet Nam in the Asian Institute \nof Technology, Ha Noi. The (joint) Regional Safeguards Community of Practice of ADB, the \nWorld Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Department of Foreign Affairs \nand Trade, Australia helped establish the two centers. Sri Lanka is already using an electronic \nmanagement information system in the road sector for land acquisition and resettlement. The \nsystem was developed using ADB TA and is considered a good platform for enhancement with \ne-tools like IR-FIRST. The TA will seek government concurrence for each of the three field tests \nonce a partner agency is identified during implementation.  \n \n14.  The TA will establish a TAT comprising at least one social safeguard specialist from \neach of the five regional departments and private sector operations department; at least one  \nexperienced mission leader from either a transport or urban development division; a social \ndevelopment specialist with advanced social impact analysis experience; a statistics specialist \nfrom the Economics and Research Department; and a relevant staff of the Office of Information \nSystems and Technology and the three resident missions. Members of the social safeguard \nnetwork will also support TA implementation. The TAT will be responsible for (i) overall TA \ncoordination; (ii) quality control and approval of standardized questionnaires, e-tool, reports, and \nknowledge products; and (iii) supervising knowledge dissemination activities. The TAT will meet \nevery 2 months, or more often as necessary, to review and comment on TA progress by the \nconsultants. As necessary, the TAT will hold short workshops (up to half a day) to allow time for \nassessment and consensus. \n \n15.  The TA will require the services of an international consulting firm selected using quality- \nand cost-based selection to deliver the TA outputs.7 The firm will provide an international social \ndevelopment  and  management  information  system  specialist  and  (or  combined  with)  an \ninvoluntary resettlement specialist, who together will provide 8 intermittent person-months. The \nfirm  will  also  provide  a  national  social  development  specialist,  located  in  Manila,  for  15 \nintermittent person-months who will provide day-to-day TA support and liaise with the TAT and \nteam members. ADB will procure the license for the e-survey software and services package, \nwhich will be utilized by the firm to develop IR-FIRST.8 The firm will conduct field testing in the \nPhilippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam and recruit the national specialists and surveyors for field \ntesting.  The  firm  will  prepare  a  consultation  program  for  the  TAT,  convene  meetings  as \nnecessary, and act as the TAT secretariat. The consultants will also prepare TA inception, \nprogress, and completion reports. Outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 3. ADB \nwill engage the consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). All procurement under the TA will be done in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  The expected outputs, feasibility report, and recommendations will be disseminated \nthrough national and headquarters workshops, relevant communities of practice within ADB, \nand the ADB website. Lessons will be shared with interested safeguard partners, including the \nWorld Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and Department of Foreign Affairs and \n                                                 \n7 ADB will consider the use of output-based (lump sum) contracts for consulting services. \n8 The cost estimate of $106,000 for equipment includes the cost of off-the-shelf software license and programming \nfee. ADB will maintain IR-FIRST. \n ", "5 \n \nTrade, Australia through the joint communities of practice, who have already shown significant \ninterest in and support for the TA. Since the TA is expected to strengthen ICT use in social \ndevelopment analysis, it is envisaged that TA results will be presented at the International \nAssociation for Impact Assessment annual meetings in 2015\u20132017. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nPiloting a Field-Integrated Review and Standardized Tool for Involuntary Resettlement, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \n     \nImpact  By 2021:    Assumption  \nEffectiveness and  Projects using IR-FIRST are  Project completion  International good practice in \ninclusiveness of ADB- rated successful at completion   reports  involuntary resettlement \nsupported projects  (Baseline: N/A)   safeguards and ADB \nenhanced    Safeguard Policy Statement \n  (2009) continue to be aligned  \n \nRisk \nDMCs are not willing to \naddress weaknesses in \ninvoluntary resettlement \nmethods and practice  \n \n       \nOutcome  By December 2016:    Assumption \nCost-effective and  IR-FIRST used in two or more  project preparatory   DMCs see the added value of \nimplementation-ready  project preparatory TA projects  reports   using IR-FIRST \nresettlement plans  (Baseline: N/A)      \ncompleted       \nCost to collect and prepare     \ninvoluntary resettlement-related \nsurveys reduced below baseline \n(Baseline = 10% of involuntary \nresettlement project preparatory \nTA budget) \n \nResettlement plans prepared \nusing IR-FIRST have all the \nrequired standardized data and \nforms (Baseline: N/A) \n \n       \nOutputs      Risk  \n1.
