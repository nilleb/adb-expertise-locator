THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $60,000,000 in Creador V L.P. \n \n2.  Creador represents, as a group, a regional private equity fund manager headquartered in \nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia that invests in companies located or with significant business activities \nin countries across South Asia and Southeast Asia (with a core focus on India, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam).1 The fund may also invest in Bangladesh, Singapore, \nSri Lanka, and Thailand on an opportunistic basis (para. 10). If approved, this would be the third \ninvestment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in a Creador-managed fund (para. 5 contains \ndetails of ADB\u2019s earlier investments). \n \n3.  Creador V L.P. (Creador V) proposes to make primarily growth equity investments in \ncompanies  operating  in  the  business  services,  consumer  goods  and services,  health  care \n(including pharmaceuticals), financial services, and manufacturing segments. As a result of ADB's \ninvestment, Creador V will be required to adopt enhanced environmental and social (E&S) \nrequirements to strengthen its investee companies\u2019 safeguards standards. Further, ADB intends \nCreador V to be the first Creador-managed fund to incorporate gender elements with assistance \nfrom ADB\u2019s private sector gender team. By incorporating ADB\u2019s proposed gender initiatives, \nCreador V is expected to improve access to social, economic, and financial resources and \nopportunities  for  women,  support  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  by  promoting  greater \nfinancial inclusion of women through investments in appropriate businesses, and strengthen \ngender equality in Creador\u2019s operations. \n \nII.  THE FUND  \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n4.  Description. Creador was established in 2011 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia by its chief \nexecutive officer (CEO) Brahmal Vasudevan, a seasoned private equity investment professional. \nVasudevan leads a large and experienced team of 42 professionals comprising 22 investment \nprofessionals and 20 strategy and operating professionals. As a regional fund manager, Creador \nmaintains a local presence and has offices in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and \nViet Nam. Since its inception in 2011, Creador has raised four funds totaling $1.5 billion in \ncommitted capital, investing about $1.2 billion across 41 investments as of 31 March 2021. \n \n5.  Investment identification. As an existing investor in Creador III L.P. ($40.9 million \ncommitment approved in November 2015) and Creador IV L.P. ($49.9 million commitment \napproved in September 2018),2 ADB understands the Creador platform well. ADB\u2019s relationship \nwith Creador dates to 2014 when ADB identified the fund manager through a comprehensive \nmarket mapping exercise of Southeast Asia as a potential partner based on  Vasudevan\u2019s \nreputation as an astute investor during his time at ChrysCapital in India and the developing track \nrecord of Creador\u2019s first two funds. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s overarching development goal in investing in Creador V is to support growing and \nwell-managed middle-market companies (with revenues of at least $10 million) in Southeast Asia \n \n1  The general partner of Creador V, Creador Management V Ltd., together with the general partners of Creador\u2019s \nprevious four funds, their investment advisors, and their respective affiliates are collectively referred to as Creador. \n2  ADB.

This information is being disclosed to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. ", "2 \nand South Asia to realize their expansion plans, thereby increasing employment, tax generation, \naccess to health and financial services, and regional growth. By supporting an established \nregional private equity manager such as Creador, ADB seeks to attract and mobilize equity growth \ncapital into markets with strong macroeconomic fundamentals driven by compelling demographic \nprofiles, growing middle classes driving domestic consumption, and established export linkages \nwith North America and Europe. \n \n7.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n8.  In addition, access to capital for women is generally considered an important driver to \nadvance women\u2019s economic empowerment and progress on gender equality in South and \nSoutheast Asia. Yet, women are significantly underrepresented globally as investment decision-\nmakers and founders of investee companies at private equity and venture capital firms. In 2019, \ncompanies founded by women received just 2.7% of global venture capital funding compared with \nthe 85.8% going to all-male founder teams.3 While very few firms apply a gender lens approach \nto their investments, gender lens financing (defined as a financing strategy intentionally looking \nat gender factors in investments toward advancing women in companies and/or advancing \ncompanies that promote a positive impact on women) is gaining important traction in Southeast \nAsia.4 In  the  past,  many  investors  have  reported  difficulty  in  identifying  gender  qualified \nenterprises since their understanding of gender lens investing was limited to companies that are \ndirectly financing businesses owned or led by women. However, the most common strategies \nused by gender lens investors have expanded to include providing critical goods and services to \nwomen and supporting businesses led and owned by women.5 As a result of these expanded \nelements, gender lens investing is having a significant development impact, especially in financial \nservices, agriculture, and workforce development. \n \n9.  Further, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to support the \neconomies  of  South  and  Southeast  Asia  with  greater  capital  investments  to  tackle  the \ndevelopment  challenges  exacerbated  by  weakened  consumer  demand,  declining  exports, \ndepressed domestic investments, and rising unemployment. ADB\u2019s participation in Creador V will, \ntherefore, contribute to increased availability of critical growth capital at a time when funding for \nnew investments (particularly from banks) is constrained and when financial institutions and \ninvestors are increasingly risk averse. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n10.  With an expected size of $600 million, Creador V aims to construct a portfolio of 10\u201312 \ngrowth investments with ticket sizes averaging $20 million\u2013$75 million each. The fund will seek \nmainly minority stakes, but may also selectively pursue control and roll up opportunities. Target \ncompanies will have significant business operations in South and/or Southeast Asia.6 Focus \n \n3  E. Hinchliffe. 2020. Funding for Female Founders Increased in 2019\u2014But Only to 2.7%.

The fund may also \ninvest up to 20% of commitments in companies that do not have significant business in South and/or Southeast Asia \nif the company has a nexus to Southeast Asia and/or South Asia. Relevant factors in determining whether a nexus \nexists include where the company has its principal place of business or headquarters, where the core of the business \nof the company is located, and where the key functions and decisions of the company will be made. Advisory board \napproval is required for any increase in this 20% limit. \n ", "3 \nareas  include  business  services,  consumer  goods  and  services,  health  care  (including \npharmaceuticals), financial services, and manufacturing, which are consistent with the targeted \nsectors of Creador\u2019s earlier funds. Creador V\u2019s holding period for each investment is expected to \nbe 2\u20135 years. Creador may commit a portion of ADB\u2019s capital in the fund toward listed companies, \nincluding  private  investments  in  public  equities  (PIPEs),  partly  to  create  early  liquidity \nopportunities for investors.7 \n \n11.  Across its portfolio, Creador prefers to assume an active role in areas where the underlying \nbusinesses need strengthening by leveraging Creador+, a unique dedicated in-house team of \n20 professionals that provides strategic and operational support to portfolio companies. Creador\u2019s \nengagement model ranges from board level oversight and strategic advisory to day-to-day \nmanagement in select instances where an investee company may be struggling to achieve \nCreador\u2019s growth plans.

Upon consummation of an investment, the Creador+ team actively engages with the \ninvestee company in areas where Creador\u2019s due diligence has identified areas of growth and \nimprovement. These areas include strategic planning, cost minimization, optimization of supply \nchain  and  distribution  channels,  streamlining  of  accounting  and  finance  functions,  talent \nacquisition, and capital raising. The Creador+ team regularly tracks the operational and financial \ndata of portfolio companies to identify operational issues early. The initial Creador+ engagement \nis typically for the first 3\u20136 months after Creador\u2019s investment. During this time, Creador+ works \nclosely with the management team of the investee company to establish appropriate business \ntargets and/or finalize operating budgets. Depending on the progress of the initial engagement \nand extent of the gaps identified, particularly if a business is underperforming, Creador+ continues \nto be actively involved in managing the company\u2019s operations and may even deploy its own staff \n \n7  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n8  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n9  ADB. 2016.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n20.  ADB intends to make an equity investment of up to $60 million in Creador V, representing \n10% of the targeted fund size. ADB\u2019s investment will not exceed 25% of Creador V\u2019s total \ncommitted capital and will not result in ADB being the single largest investor in Creador V. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n21.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  Exit strategy. Creador V has a 10-year term from its final closing date, which can be \nextended by two 1-year periods, with the consent of a majority in interest of the fund\u2019s limited \npartners. The exit strategies for Creador V\u2019s investments include public offerings on global stock \nexchanges, trade sales of portfolio companies to strategic buyers, and secondary sales to other \nprivate equity funds. \n \n23.  Reporting arrangements. The general partner will be required to provide ADB with \nunaudited quarterly reports, audited annual reports with financial statements, a fund overview, \nannual development effectiveness monitoring reports, and an overview of the portfolio. ADB will \nreview this information and follow up with the general partner if more information or clarification is \nneeded. If the information received from the general partner raises issues that could impair the \nvalue of ADB\u2019s investment in Creador V, ADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more \nfrequent and detailed reviews. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  Gender inclusiveness. The general partner has committed to adopt measures promoting \ngender equality across Creador V\u2019s operations by introducing and implementing a gender lens \ninvesting approach in the fund\u2019s portfolio and enhancing gender-inclusive workplace practices. \nADB has worked with the general partner to design a gender action plan, which the general \n \n11 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "5 \npartner has committed to implement.12 \n \n25.  Environmental and social standards. ADB\u2019s participation will obligate the fund to adopt, \nand to require Creador V\u2019s investee companies to adopt, ADB\u2019s E&S safeguard policies and \nrequirements, and report on development indicators (footnote 21). In this context, Creador \ninformed ADB of its intention to build out a dedicated in-house E&S team to oversee the execution \nof the fund\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS) for Creador V and its prior \nfunds. In response to Creador\u2019s request, ADB is providing guidance in recruiting a well-qualified \nE&S professional to head this team. ADB is also working with Creador to enhance the fund\u2019s E&S \ndue diligence, monitoring, and reporting processes (para. 42). \n \n26.  Governance oversight. ADB, along with other members of Creador V\u2019s advisory board, \nwill also provide oversight on important governance matters including issues relating to conflicts \nof interest. \n \nE.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n33.  Impact. Access to growth capital for middle-market companies in South and Southeast \nAsia in Creador V\u2019s target sectors improved at a time when capital availability for new investments \nis constrained and when financial institutions and investors are increasingly risk averse given \nuncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n34.  Outcome. Private equity investments to improve funding for middle-market companies in \ntargeted sectors in South and Southeast Asia expanded. \n \n35.  Outputs. The outputs are (i) Creador V is successfully established, and (ii) gender equality \nin Creador operations introduced. \n \n12 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \nPUBLIC. This information is being disclosed to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. ", "6 \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n36.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy.  The  investment  in  Creador  V  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 operational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities), \nwhich mandates ADB to undertake efforts to generate quality jobs to support inclusive growth for \nall.13 This  investment  also  aims to  accelerate  progress  on  gender  equality,  contributing to \nStrategy 2030 operational priority 2, which calls for scaling up support for gender equality and \npromoting women\u2019s empowerment through increasing financial inclusion, supporting women\u2019s \nentrepreneurship, and improving access to job skills. \n \n37.  Consistency  with  country  strategies.  The  proposed  investment  in  Creador  V  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for Indonesia, which prioritizes inclusive \ngrowth by improving job creation, deepening financial markets, and strengthening the health care \nsystem.14 The investment is also aligned with ADB\u2019s CPS for India, which highlights fostering \nregional cooperation and supporting the manufacturing, health, and education sectors as strategic \npriorities.15 In the Philippines, ADB\u2019s CPS highlights promoting local investments as one of its \nthree pillars.16 Similarly, the proposed investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s CPS for Viet Nam, \nwhich places emphasis on promoting job creation and competitiveness, supporting small and \nmedium-sized business enterprises, and improving access to services.17 \n \n38.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The investment in \nCreador V is consistent with ADB\u2019s operational plan for private sector operations, which supports \ninvestments in private equity funds that enable ADB to deploy and mobilize equity capital \nefficiently to support companies in realizing their expansion plans, thereby generating strong \nmultiplier effects on ADB\u2019s capital.18 \n  \n39.  Lessons from previous operations. A corporate evaluation of ADB\u2019s private sector \nequity  investments  concluded  that  ADB  should  refine  its  approach  to  private  equity  fund \ninvestments  to  ensure  their  financial  sustainability  and  to  prioritize  value  addition  and \ndevelopment impact.19 In this project, ADB is making a third investment in a Creador-managed \n \nfund. Given ADB\u2019s ongoing, strong relationship with Creador, which formally began in 2015 with \nan investment in Creador III L.P., ADB is comfortable with the management and investment \nteams\u2019 experience and track record, Creador\u2019s investment strategy for South and Southeast Asia, \nand the quality of Creador\u2019s deal pipeline. Further, ADB builds on the experience that the general \npartner\u2019s mandate in Asia (consistent with prior funds in which ADB has invested) aligns strongly \nwith ADB\u2019s areas of development focus and conforms to a rigorous multistage underwriting \nprocess that identifies potential market leading companies with strong management teams. \nTherefore, the project team is proceeding with the investment upon confirmation through its due \ndiligence  that  Creador  V  meets  the  criteria  of  financial  sustainability,  value  addition,  and \ndevelopment impact. \n \n13 ADB. 2018.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).20 \n \n41.  Category FI. The project is classified category FI for impacts on environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The \nfund\u2019s potential E&S impacts, the risks associated with existing and likely future portfolio, and its \ncommitment and capacity for E&S management have been assessed as part of the safeguards\u2019 \ndue diligence process. The fund\u2019s business activities are expected to be similar to Creador III L.P. \nand Creador IV L.P.  \n \n42.  Creador\u2019s existing ESMS (dated April 2020) applies ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities \nlist; has procedures in place to screen, assess, and address E&S risks of investee companies; \nand has provisions requiring the fund to oblige investee companies to operate in accordance with \napplicable national laws and regulations and to implement any corrective action plan.21 To \nstrengthen the fund\u2019s ESMS implementation, Creador is committed to (i) engage a dedicated and \nqualified E&S manager and strengthen its E&S capacity, (ii) enhance its process for engagement \nwith ADB during investment due diligence, (iii) enhance its monitoring and data collection of \ninvestee companies, (iv) enhance its E&S reporting to ADB, (v) enhance the grievance redress \nmechanism to cover all portfolio companies, and (vi) prepare an E&S training program tailored to \nthe needs of the organization. ADB will have the right to be excused from contributing capital to \nany  investment  classified  category  A  (for  all  safeguard  classifications)  and  any  proposed \ninvestment that it assesses as being noncompliant with the ESMS. \n \n43.  Effective  gender mainstreaming.
