THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Kiribati for the additional financing of the Road Rehabilitation Project.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  additional  financing  will  facilitate  the  rehabilitation  of  important  road \nnetwork links by adding 7.8 kilometers (km) of paved roads and 0.5 km of unpaved roads to \ncover additional geographic areas in Betio and Bairiki linked to the current project, and assisting \nwith expenditures to be incurred in completing the civil works. The additional scope will result in \nthe overall project rehabilitating 37.5 km of paved roads and 8.5 km of unpaved feeder roads on \nSouth Tarawa.2 The additional road sections will complement the current project by ensuring \nconsistent road quality throughout the entire South Tarawa road network. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background. Kiribati is a small, remote country consisting of 33 of dispersed islands \nover 3.5 million square km of ocean. Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati, has a population of 56,300 \n(55% of the total country population) and an average population density of 4,000 persons per \nsquare km.3 The communities on this island are linked to each other, and the international \nairport, by a single main paved road and three causeways that run from east to west. Urban \ndevelopment along the main road corridor, particularly in the far west in the main urban center \nof Betio, provides opportunities for cash employment and access to essential social services. \n \n4.  Current project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project ADF loan on \n20 December 2010 in the amount of SDR7,621,000 ($12 million) for the Road Rehabilitation \nProject. In 2015, ADB provided additional financing in the form of an ADF grant in the amount of \n$2.4 million. The current project (i.e., the original project and the first additional financing) \nsought to significantly improve people\u2019s lives by rehabilitating the South Tarawa road network, \nwhich in 2010 was acknowledged to have served its economic life. The road network serves the \nhabitable part of the atoll, which is generally no more than 100 meters wide, with most of the \npopulation living, working, or studying in buildings that line both sides of the road. \n \n5.  There is strong collaboration between the cofinanciers and the government to deliver the \nproject, with project cofinancing at $66.16 million inclusive of ADB\u2019s share. The current project \nhas  received  $26.97  million  of  cofinancing  from  the  World  Bank,  $15.21  million  from  the \nGovernment of Australia through the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility, and $3.65 million \nfrom the Government of Australia through the Australia\u2013Pacific Islands Partnership Trust Fund.4 \nThe government\u2019s contribution has increased from $1.05 million in 2010 to $5.93 million in 2015. \n \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n3  Government of Kiribati. 2016. 2015 Population and Housing Census Preliminary Report. Tarawa. \n4  On 31 January 2011, the World Bank increased its financing from $16 million to $20 million. In addition the \nGovernment of Australia through the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility increased its financing from $4.61 million \nto $5.79 million as a result of including an additional 5 km of paved road and 2 km of unpaved road. \n ", "2 \n6.  The current project is in line with the development objectives set out in the Kiribati \nDevelopment  Plan,  2016\u20132019,  which  seeks  to  (i)  achieve  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction;  and  (ii)  create  a  sustainable  environment,  and  sustainable  governance  and \ninfrastructure.5 The additional financing is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2017\u20132019 for Kiribati; ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020, which serves as the country \npartnership strategy; and ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.6 The current project also \nsupports the government\u2019s efforts in the draft Transport Sector Development Plan 2016 to (i) \nserve mobility and accessibility needs; and (ii) provide reliable, safe, and economically efficient \ntransport as priorities for improving economic development.7 South Tarawa has 41.6 km of \npaved roads and approximately 40 km of unpaved roads that support access to most areas in \nBetio, Bairiki, Bikenibeu, and Buota. Prior to the commencement of the project, inadequate \nroutine road and drainage maintenance, prolonged wet weather, and heavy traffic volumes \ncontributed to the rapid deterioration of the road network in South Tarawa. \n \n7.  The first additional financing, approved in 2015 (footnote 2), was necessary to help meet \nthe financing gap identified with the civil works contract due to (i) underestimated base costs at \nthe design stage, (ii) implementation delays that further introduced material escalation costs, (iii) \nexchange rate fluctuations effects, and (iv) increased transport costs.8 The government and the \ncontractor agreed on overall costs for the current work scope totaling A$59 million inclusive of \nall  claims,  variations,  currency  fluctuations,  and  extensions.  The  request  for  the  second \nadditional financing is to scale up the road network links by constructing an additional 7.8 km of \npaved main roads and 0.5 km of unpaved feeder roads to cover additional geographic areas in \nBetio and Bairiki that will be linked to the current project. \n \n8.  Current project performance. Progress on project implementation since the civil works \ncontractor mobilized in July 2013, has advanced satisfactorily despite the initial procurement \ndelays. As of October 2016, physical progress is at 96% with 97% elapsed time. As of the third \nquarter of 2016, the current project was classified as performing well. The following aspects \nhave been assessed:  \n(i)  Delivery of expected outputs. \n(a)  Output  1. Coastal protection works; 35.7 km of pavements with road \nsafety features, including speed bumps, street lighting, and road signage; \nand  more  than  50  km  of  footpaths  are  complete.  Extreme  weather \ndamaged the Betio causeway rock armor, resulting in deletion of the \ncauseway pavement works.9 The road sector reforms are progressing \nwell with the completion of the road safety action plan and the preparation \nof draft traffic legislation. \n                                                \n5  Government of Kiribati. 2016.

Consultant\u2019s report. Tarawa. Unpublished. \n8  The civil works contract awarded on 12 February 2013 was for A$48.2 million (then equivalent to $50.1 million). \nThe bid was denominated 13.00% in Australian dollars, 81.41% in New Zealand dollars, and 5.58% in United \nStates dollars. The contract was signed on 12 February 2013 and the start date was 1 July 2013. The procurement \ncontract summary sheet created at the time of contract award was for $7.59 million, to align with ADB\u2019s allocation \nof the loan proceeds. \n9  On 26 July 2016, the government signed a grant agreement with the Government of Japan, through the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, for the reconstruction of Nippon causeway project for $35.8 million. The current \nproject\u2019s civil works contractor has completed pavement of 0.4 km along the western approach of the Betio \n(Nippon) causeway and carried out repair works to keep the length of the causeway accessible. \n ", "3 \n(b)  Output  2.  The  contractor  is  finalizing  contracts  for  the \nengagement of small community-based subcontractors to perform routine \nroad  maintenance  during  the  2-year  defects  notification  period.  The \ncommunity-based maintenance teams have received training on the use \nof maintenance manuals. At least three teams will be formally established \nby 2017. \n(c)  Output  3.  The  Ministry  of  Public Works  and  Utilities  (MPWU) \nrecruited a technical advisor to monitor project implementation. In addition, \nthe  Kiribati  Fiduciary  Services  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nEconomic Development provides project coordination and fiduciary and \nprocurement support. \n(ii)  Satisfactory  implementation  progress.  The  World  Bank  administers  the \nongoing  jointly  funded  civil  works  contract.  The  contract  for  the  design  and \nsupervision consultant, fully funded by ADB, was awarded on 2 December 2010 \nfor $2.15 million. As of September 2016, the total contract amount was $5.76 \nmillion,  including  variations  related  to  additional  design  inputs,  additional \nconstruction supervision inputs, and environmental monitoring. As of October \n2016, ADB had disbursed 96% of ADF loan funds ($10.83 million) and 100% of \nADF grant funds ($2.4 million). \n(iii)  Satisfactory compliance with safeguard policy requirements. Compliance \nwith World Bank, ADB, and national safeguard policy requirements and plans is \nsatisfactory. No major issues have arisen to date.10 \n(iv)  Successful management of risks. The project has successfully managed and \nmitigated  the  risks  identified  during  processing  and  implementation.  Regular \ncoordination meetings with the Public Utilities Board and project stakeholders will \ncontinue to take place to monitor and address any implementation risks. \n(v)  On track rating. The project is rated on track and has performed consistently \nwell since November 2014. \n \n9.  Proposed additional scope. This second proposal for additional financing is to scale up \nthe road network links by rehabilitating an additional 7.8 km of paved main roads and 0.5 km of \nunpaved feeder roads to cover the additional geographic areas in Betio and Bairiki that will be \nlinked to the current project. The additional scope and associated costs is considered necessary \nto ensure that the project development objectives are met. The provision of additional financing \nwould also enable the existing civil works contractor to undertake the remaining works in a \ntimely and cost-effective manner, as the time and cost to mobilize a new contractor in Kiribati \nare significant. \n \n10.  The  road  sections  in  Betio  and  Bairiki  road  sections,  proposed  for  the  additional \nfinancing,  were  in  good  condition  at  the  project  scoping  stage  in  2010.  Since  then,  poor \ndrainage, inadequate road maintenance, and extreme wet weather during 2015 and early 2016 \nhave  caused  these  road  sections  to  deteriorate  to  very  poor  condition.  The  government, \ntherefore, decided to improve these road sections to enhance access to employment, markets, \nand services. \n \n \n                                                \n10 The cofinanciers entered into a Memorandum of Understanding dated 5 March 2012, which provides guidance on \nthe cofinanciers cooperation, coordination and sharing of information, particularly on the review of procurement \nprocesses, as well as safeguard requirements to ensure mutual agreement on project-related matters. \n ", "4 \n11.  Retroactive financing. In June 2016, Cabinet approved the MPWU submission for the \nadditional work and authorized the use of its own funds as bridge financing to cover costs until \nadditional financing from a donor was confirmed. Following Cabinet\u2019s decision, the Ministry of \nFinance and Economic Development requested ADB that $9 million of the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) grant resources be brought forward from 2017\u20132018 to 2016 to provide additional \nfinancing for the rehabilitation of the damaged road sections in Betio and Bairiki. As the current \nproject implementation was near completion, the government authorized the additional works \nusing its own funds, before ADB could confirm the ability to bring forward the ADF resources. \nThe government decision was made on the consideration that a delayed instruction to the \ncontractor would have resulted in demobilization and a lack of in-country resources capable of \nconstructing the important road network links. The government considers the additional road \nsections as high-priority roads as these are part of an essential road link that completes the \nroad network around Betio and Bairiki. Works commenced in June 2016 and are expected to be \nfully completed by December 2016. Currently, government has disbursed about A$9.5 million of \nits own funds and expects further payments to be made for the remaining period. Subsequently, \nthe government requested ADB to support the works with additional financing and requested \napproval for 100% retroactive financing. \n \n12.  With only 4% of the total 37.7 km of the original paved road and unpaved feeder road \nconstruction remaining, the volume of the additional work, is less than the ongoing contract, and \nits  accomplishment  will  ensure  the  overall  road  network  improvement  in  the  area.  The \ngovernment, ADB, and cofinanciers are satisfied with the very high quality of the works and \ntimeliness  of  implementation.  The  project  team  has  assessed  the  additional  sections  and \nconfirms that rehabilitating these sections will achieve a consistent road quality throughout the \nentire South Tarawa road network completed under the current project. Further, the project \nteam has assessed that the works are in full compliance with ADB procurement and safeguard \nguidelines and confirms that all current contract obligations remain. The works are ongoing and \nphysical completion is expected by February 2017. For this reason, the team deems that the \ngovernment's request for 100% retroactive financing can be supported.  \n \n13.  Under  ADB\u2019s  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of  Expenditures,  retroactive  financing  is \npermitted only if, among other factors, (i) it is specifically agreed by ADB and the recipient of \ngrant financing in the grant agreement, and (ii) the amount to be retroactively financed does not \nexceed 20% of the grant.11 For the reason set out in paras. 11-12 above, the project team seeks \na waiver from ADB\u2019s Board on the 20% ceiling for retroactive financing and requests that the \nBoard approve retroactive financing for 100% of the grant amount. \n \n14.  The current project is eligible for additional financing because (i) it remains technically \nfeasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) the government includes the investment \nas high priority in the Kiribati Development Plan (footnote 5); (iii) the additional financing is \nconsistent with the project\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) the overall project is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s current country partnership strategy.12 The current project is rated as performing well. \nThe safeguard categorization of the overall project remains unchanged. Additional financing of \nthe current project is the most efficient way for ADB to maintain support for achieving the \ngovernment\u2019s objective in the road transport sector and is a suitable modality to make sure that \n(i) the overall project is successfully completed, (ii) the targets and indicators of the design and \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2012.

The  impact  and  outcome  of  the  overall  project  will  not  change  with  the  additional \nfinancing. The impact will be an improvement in socioeconomic conditions for the people of \nSouth Tarawa. The outcome will be their access to a safe, sustainable, and well-maintained \nroad network. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1 under the current project is that the government rehabilitates and upgrades \n29.7 km of paved main roads and 8.0 km of unpaved feeder roads of the road network on South \nTarawa. The additional financing will expand the output 1 core indicators by constructing an \nadditional 7.8 km of the main road in Betio and 0.5 km of selected feeder road, increasing the \ntotal rehabilitated and upgraded roads to 37.5 km of paved main roads and 8.5 km of unpaved \nfeeder roads. Outputs 2 and 3 will remain unchanged. The design and monitoring framework \nhas been revised (Appendix 1). \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The additional grant of $9 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF) together \nwith the government\u2019s additional contribution will increase the investment in the current project \nby 15%.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The overall project has been assessed as technically viable, as demonstrated by the \nabsence of any significant technical issues during the ongoing civil works. Project preparation \nincluded  a  comprehensive  road  safety  audit  of  all  of  South  Tarawa\u2019s  roads,  and  the \nrecommendations have informed the detailed engineering design.15 The project team confirms \nquality tests demonstrate the results met or exceeded specifications. The additional scope \nincluding road designs, safety features, pavement surfacing, and costs have been verified by \nthe consulting engineer. The MPWU continues to monitor works and will issue instructions for \nremedial works, where required. The road runs near the edge of the lagoon for most of its length. \nA rise in sea level, extreme annual cycles of spring tides, and increased erosion are the most \nsignificant threats to its sustainability. Within the town areas of Betio and Bairiki, the additional \nscope will make use of existing drainage features (i.e., soak pits installed by the MPWU and \ndrains installed during the previous Government of Japan-financed road improvements), with \nsome works proposed to improve drainage. This will include cleaning out of existing drainage \nand, where practicable (in terms of site constraints and associated costs), landscape areas \nadjacent to the road to minimize roadway inundation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The additional financing will fund the rehabilitation of missing links of the road network in \nhigh traffic areas. The preliminary economic analysis yielded an overall economic internal rate \nof return of 35.6% (from 40.3% in the original appraisal). The project remains economically \nviable.16 Such high returns reflect the significant transport cost savings from the 6,000 vehicles \nper day utilizing a much-improved road pavement. Consideration of unquantified road safety, \nhealth  benefits,  and  potential  decongestion  on  the main  road  in  Betio further bolsters the \neconomic viability of the project. \n \n22.  The  project  roads  are  nonrevenue-earning  and  operated  by  the  MPWU,  a \nnoncommercial  unit  that  receives  annual  allocations  for  operation  and  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure  assets.

These  would, \ntherefore, facilitate consistently adequate allocations to the MPWU for routine and periodic road \nmaintenance. Government allocations are likely to be funded through the Revenue Equalization \nReserve Fund, which should provide adequate operation and maintenance funding and support \nthe sustainability of infrastructure assets. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  Financial management. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment, \nconducted in Kiribati in 2010, indicated that public financial management is weakened by (i) a \nlack  of  fiscal  discipline,  (ii)  non-retirement  of  advances,  (iii)  lack  of  financial  reconciliation \nbetween the executing agency\u2014the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED)\u2014\nand the line ministries, (iv) lack of effective expenditure commitment controls, and (v) outdated \nlegislation and regulations.17 Since then, development partners, including ADB, have assisted \nthe government in designing and implementing the Kiribati Public Financial Management Plan, \n2011\u20132014.18 Improvements in public financial management have been noted by the project \nteam, and the government plans to update the public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment in 2017. \n \n24.  The financial management arrangements for the current project will continue for the \nadditional financing. In February 2016, the World Bank carried out an implementation review \nthat included assessing the financial management arrangements in the MFED and MPWU. The \nreview was satisfactory, and ADB is comfortable with the World Bank's assessment. The MFED \nwill continue to be responsible for the overall financial management of the project. A full-time \nqualified project accountant continues to handle all financial management activities. The project \nwill  continue  to  use  direct  payment  and  reimbursement  disbursement  procedures,  and  all \nrequired audits will be carried out. Currently, no audited project financial statements are overdue, \nand  no  financial  management  issues  are  pending.  Of  the  four  audited  project  financial \nstatements received, two were submitted early and two were submitted after the deadline. All \naudit reports were issued with unqualified opinions. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  The project will directly benefit the entire population of 56,300 (51.5% female and 48.5% \nmale) of Tarawa, for whom the road is a vital shared communal asset (footnote 3). As the lone \nvehicular transport route on the atoll, the road provides access to vital infrastructure, social \nservices, and economic opportunities. It sustains economic development, links communities, \nand is also the main thoroughfare for pedestrians. It will reduce roadside dust and improve air \nquality,  leaving  homes,  shops,  and  vehicles  cleaner;  and  reduce  damage  to  mechanical \nequipment. New footpaths will improve pedestrian safety and reduce reliance and spending on \nvehicle transport while encouraging nonmotorized transport. \n \n26.  The  current  project  diligently  carries  out  a  HIV/AIDS  information  and  education \ncampaign for the contractor\u2019s employees, subcontractors, consultants, and communities near \nthe project site. \n   \n                                                \n17 Government of Kiribati. 2010.

Safeguards \n \n27.  Environment.  The  current  project  is  classified  category  B,  and  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) prepared was updated to reflect ongoing impacts. The project is \ncurrently operating under the revised version 6 of the EMP approved in December 2015. The \nresulting  contractor\u2019s  EMP  (revision  N)  was  accepted  in  August  2015.  The  main  potential \nimpacts are (i) disturbance from dust arising from loading, unloading, and transportation of \nconstruction materials; (ii) noise; (iii) erosion and sedimentation from exposed surfaces during \nconstruction, which may affect the lagoon environment; (iv) risks from the use and disposal of \nhazardous materials such as used fuel and lubricants; and (v) greater risk of accidents from \nmore vehicle movements. Detailed mitigation measures were incorporated in the project, as \noutlined  in  the  EMP.  An  international  environment  specialist  and  a  national  environment \ninspector were engaged during the construction phase to monitor compliance with the EMP and \nreport to the Ministry of Environment, Land and Agricultural Development. The environmental \nclassification for the additional financing is classified categorized C. \n \n28.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified category \nB, and the resettlement plan has been updated to reflect anticipated impacts and provide \nguidelines for any unanticipated impacts. The additional financing is classified categorized C \nsince no buildings are to be relocated and no economic crops are affected under the project. To \nthe extent possible, the roads to be rehabilitated will follow the current road alignment, and any \nresettlement or compensation for economic loss will be undertaken in accordance with the \nupdated resettlement plan. To date, compensation for loss of land and assets, mainly for the \nloss of fruit-bearing trees, has been paid to 97% of affected persons (327 in total). An escrow \naccount has been established for the compensation of the remaining 13 affected persons as \nsoon as the pending court cases are resolved and affected persons are traced. The project is \nclassified category C for indigenous peoples, and no indigenous peoples, as defined under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), are expected to be affected by the overall project. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  No significant issues are expected to arise in implementing the overall project. Major \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.19 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n30.  The government and the MFED have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and grant document. \n \n31.
