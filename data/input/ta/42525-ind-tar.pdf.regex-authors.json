INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following a request of the Government of India (the Government) during the Country \nProgramming Mission in July 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) included policy and \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Study  on  Cross-Sectoral  Implications  of  Biofuel \nProduction and Use in the country operations business plan1 for 2009. ADB fielded a fact-\nfinding mission during 14\u201318 July 2008. In a letter dated 21 January 2009, the Department of \nEconomic Affairs (DEA) provided government confirmation to the aide-m\u00e9moire containing the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, terms of \nreference of consultants, and design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) .2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India has many years of experience using renewable energy sources to fulfill the energy \nneeds of its population. This includes exploitation of both traditional sources (such as biomass) \nand nontraditional sources (such as wind power). India has been the region\u2019s research hub on \nthe use of biomass for electricity generation as well as development of biofuels, mainly to \nreplace fossil fuels used in the transport sector. Up to now, the production of biofuels in India \nhas  concentrated  on  ethanol  and  the  use  of  non-edible  sources  such  as  Jatropha3.  It  is \nexpected that the focus will remain on non-edible sources in the foreseeable future. These \nbiofuel interventions are well placed within India\u2019s Integrated Energy Policy of 20064 and the \nNational Action Plan of Climate Change of 2008.5 \n \n3.  India  has  an  estimated  64  million  hectares  (ha)  of  wasteland,  out  of  which  about \n17 million ha are likely to be suitable for biofuel crops. Under the current biodiesel strategy, \nabout 400,000 ha of marginal land are to be brought under biodiesel crop cultivation. It is \nexpected that India will achieve a target of 20% blending of biodiesel by 2012. In 2005, India \nintroduced a biodiesel purchase policy6 that allowed public sector oil marketing companies to \npurchase biodiesel at 20 identified centers in different states. \n \n4.  A variety of issues involving the production and use of biofuels need to be understood \nbefore interventions in this sector. These include issues involving usage of land, water, and \nlabor;  replacement  of  food  crop  cultivation  with  biofuel  crop  cultivation;  and  adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts.  These issues require careful attention and need to be \naddressed  in  an  integrated  manner.  Taking  them  in  isolation  could  lead  to  conflicting \nconclusions and recommendations leading to suboptimal solutions in the context of overall \neconomic development. Therefore, a balanced view on biofuel production and use is required \nconsidering these interactions among different sectors. \n \n5.  An in-depth study on the production and use of biofuels would allow the Government to \nhave appropriate and balanced interventions in this sector. This would optimize the contribution \nof biofuels in replacing high carbon-emitting fuels. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008.

Originating in the Caribbean, Jatropha was spread as a valuable hedge \nplant to Africa and Asia. Jatropha produces seeds containing up to 40% oil. When the seeds are crushed and \nprocessed, the resulting oil can be used in a standard diesel engine. \n4   Planning Commission, Government of India. 2006. Integrated Energy Policy.

The impact of the policy and advisory TA will be improved energy security and low \ncarbon energy sector development through appropriate bioenergy interventions. The indicators \nwill be reduction in projected oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n7.  The outcome of the TA will be well-informed interventions in the biofuels sector with due \nconsideration given to the cross-sectoral interactions and multifaceted nature of the impacts of \nbiofuel production and use. The indicator will be Government acceptance of a national policy \nand strategies on biofuel production and use accepted by the Government. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The methodology for successful implementation of the TA is the following: \n \n(i)  Literature survey on the worldwide production and use of biofuels, with specific \nemphasis on activities in South Asia. This will include a review of the extent of \nthe contribution of the biofuels sector to the sustainable development of these \ncountries and regions. \n(ii)  Study on the impact of biofuel production on agriculture and food security, land \nand water use, human resource utilization, rural employment generation, and \npoverty reduction in relation to the traditional biofuel crops used in India.7 \n(iii)  Extend study (ii) to include second-generation biofuels.8 \n(iv)  Study on possible biofuel penetration scenarios in the energy sector and their \nimpact on the overall socioeconomic environment. \n(v)  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  biofuel  production,  considering  the \nopportunity costs of factors such as land, water, and human resources; and the \nbenefit  of  replacing  imported  fossil  fuels.  Incentives  and  subsidies  will  be \nincluded during the financial analysis; an output of this will be the cost recovery \nprice of biofuels. \n(vi)  Estimation of possible greenhouse gas and other emission reductions under \ndifferent scenarios of biofuel production and use. \n(vii)  Reviewing the eligibility criteria for Clean Development Mechanism financing in \nbiofuel development. \n(viii)  Examining  the  investment  opportunities  in  different  subsectors,  including \npotential for projects under the Clean Development Mechanism. \n(ix)  Suggestions for government interventions with an integrated approach, including \nthose in the legal and regulatory environment, to maximize the overall benefits \nfrom expansion of the biofuels sector. \n(x)  Dissemination  of  the  findings  among  all  the  stakeholders  such  as  relevant \ngovernment  line  agencies,  research  institutions,  academia,  and  different \npressure groups active in the areas of biofuels, energy, and environment.  \n \n9.  The key output of the TA is a report containing the output of activities (i) to (v). This \nreport, along with the proposed outreach program for stakeholders on the findings of the study, \n                                                 \n7 Based on secondary data from other studies and relevant publications. \n8 Global experience adopted and extended to India for the analysis. \n ", "  3\nwill assist the Government in deciding and implementing required government interventions in \nthe biofuels sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $625,000. Of this, $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund-other \nsources). The Government will finance $125,000 equivalent of local currency costs through in-\nkind contributions, including office accommodation and related facilities and counterpart staff. \nThe detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  DEA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA.  It  will  provide  necessary  office \naccommodation for the consultants and provide counterpart staff. It will assist the consultants to \nliaise with the relevant ministries and other government agencies and to establish a working \nrelationship with these agencies. The TA is expected to start by April 2009 and close by \nDecember 2009. DEA has assured the availability of counterpart services, facilities, and funds \nby the start of the TA. \n \n12.  The TA will require the services of 3 international consultants for a total period of \n16 person-months and one national consultant for a period of 6 person-months. The consulting \nteam will include an international biofuels specialist, an international energy economist, an \ninternational environmental and social specialist, and a national biofuel specialist. ADB will \nrecruit the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). All four consultants will be recruited as individual consultants. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.9 \n \n13.  The findings of the study will be disseminated through a stakeholder seminar to be held \nafter completion of the study report, and through internal as well as external seminars and \nconferences. The report and the outcome evaluation will be made available on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  consultants  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  Study  on  Cross-\nSectoral Implications of Biofuel Production and Use based on policy and advisory technical \nassistance (TA) will provide a comprehensive analysis of issues involving biofuel production and \nuse.  Since  biofuel  production  and  use  concern  many  sectors\u2014such  as  energy,  transport, \nagriculture, social development, and the environment\u2014it is essential that the final outcome of \nthe project is balanced from the point of view of all these sectors. Further, given this cross-\nsectoral nature, it is important that the TA is executed and implemented by a nodal agency \nresponsible for the highest levels of decision making in the overall economy. The Executing \nAgency of the TA will be the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA).  \n \n2.  The consultants will (i) review work on biofuels already carried out for South Asia, \n(ii) compile international experience in the production and use of biofuels, (iii) critically analyze \nthe future of biofuels in India vis-\u00e0-vis international experience, (iv) consult all the stakeholders, \n(v) derive conclusions from the analysis and suggest interventions required in the biofuels \nsector, and (vi) conduct an outreach program. The data source needs to be clarified in all the \ndocuments. Where necessary to meet ADB standards and requirements, the consultants will \nalso conduct primary data collection and analysis. \n \n3.  The TA will require the services of 3 international consultants for a total period of \n16 person-months and 1 national consultant for a period of 6 person-months. The consulting \nteam will include an international biofuels specialist, an international energy economist, an \ninternational environmental and social specialist, and a national biofuel specialist.
