At the first Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Summit of Leaders in Phnom Penh, \nCambodia, in November 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was asked to help build \nbadly needed human capacity in the GMS. In response, the GMS: Phnom Penh Plan for \nDevelopment  Management  (PPP)  was  designed  by  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  the  GMS \ncountries, and an initial 2-year phase was approved in 2002 for $0.8 million.1 The New Zealand \nAgency for International Development (NZAID) supported the program.2 PPP is focused on \npublic policy and development management. The plan aims to impart knowledge and skills to \nmiddle- and senior-level GMS civil servants to support the enhanced design and management \nof development programs at national and subregional levels. \n  \n2.  Since its inception, PPP delivered 20 demand-based learning programs benefiting over \n300 middle- and senior-level GMS officials. A Learning Resource Center was established in \nADB\u2019s Cambodia Resident Mission to promote GMS awareness and knowledge. A network of \ncapacity-building  partners  was  created,  and  a  GMS  research  framework  was  endorsed  in \npartnership  with  the  GMS  Academic  and  Research  Network.  A  biannual  Journal  of  GMS \nDevelopment Studies has commenced publication, and a PPP Web site was established. A \nPPP  fellowship  program  that  sends  promising  alumni  to  programs  of  higher  learning  at \ninstitutions  of  international  repute  was  launched.  At  the  13th  GMS  Ministerial  meeting  in \nDecember 2004, GMS countries recognized the value-added provided by PPP and requested \nADB technical assistance (TA) for continuing the Plan with an expanded scope. This request \nwas considered by ADB, and the TA responds to this request. The TA framework is in Appendix \n1.3  A  review  of  the  GMS  PPP  Phase  1,  covering  key  outputs  and  lessons  learned,  is  in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  initiated  in  1992,  made  significant \ninvestments in infrastructure that laid the foundation for improved connectivity and broad-based \nsocioeconomic  growth.  Intraregional  trade  has  increased  and  the  economic  activity  so \ngenerated contributed to marked poverty reduction in some GMS countries. Investments in \nsocial development are rising. Rapid and necessary engagement of the GMS in the global \neconomy is also occurring. However, the GMS vision for enhanced connectivity, increased \ncompetitiveness, and greater sense of community requires parallel efforts aimed at developing \nhuman resources. Capacities are needed at individual, institutional, and organizational levels to \neffectively plan and manage a rapidly evolving and complex subregional development agenda. \n \n4.  A broad set of skills and knowledge is needed by development administrators in the \nGMS.4 Evidence shows that capacities, though improving, are still inadequate in a variety of \ncritical  fields.  The  quality  of  development  decisions  and  effectiveness  of  development \nadministration depends heavily on the ability of civil servants to effectively lead and manage the \ndevelopment  process.  Relevant  and  qualitatively  superior  skill  sets,  superior  leadership \nattributes, updated sector and thematic knowledge, and modernized know-how on cutting-edge \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. GMS: Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management. Manila. \n2  NZAID contributed NZ$500,000 in March 2003. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 November 2004. \n4  A GMS training needs analysis was conducted by ADB, in cooperation with the Mekong Institute and NZAID, in \nOctober 2003. The analysis was undertaken in a participative way across all GMS countries through a sampled \ngroup of GMS public officials. PPP learning programs are based on skill and knowledge demands reflected in the \nanalysis and on evolving needs of GMS governments. \n ", " 2   \nmanagement tools and concepts will contribute to the makings of a professional and committed \ncadre of GMS civil servants. \n \n5.  A key constraint to GMS cooperation was inadequate capacity to integrate and align \nnational plans with subregional plans. Taking the initiative to integrate across a variety of fronts \nand plan and manage initiatives requires leadership and skill sets that are different from those \nthat are typically required to meet national development goals. Aligning national programs with \nthe imperatives of regional cooperation places demands on the capacity of GMS governments. \nThese capacity constraints hinder the ability of GMS countries to maximize the benefits and \nmitigate the risks brought about by regional cooperation. \n \n6.  Governance is a critical development issue in the GMS. While the countries have varied \ngovernance systems and cultures and are at different stages of socioeconomic development, \nthe range of capacity-building needs is remarkably common. The needs are essentially twofold. \nAt a subject matter level, sector and thematic needs constitute one group, and public policy and \ndevelopment  management  constitute  the  other.  Subjects  in  the  former  group  include \ngovernance and regional cooperation and private sector development, as well as special skills \nsuch as trade facilitation and trade policy negotiations. They also include skills required to \naccomplish sector objectives in education, health, agriculture, urban development, environment, \nwater supply, energy, transport, labor, and others. The latter group includes leadership and \nstrategic management, planning, human resource development, organization development, and \nproject management. \n \n7.  PPP responded to improving the quality of development decisions by focusing on a \nrange of capacity-building needs in three ways. First, PPP conducted short-term, high-impact \nprograms  targeting  senior  civil  servants,  focusing  on  public  policy  and  development \nmanagement.  Second,  PPP  offered  thematic  and  sector-specific  courses  targeting  middle \nmanagers,  who  constitute  the  administrative  backbone,  in  implementing  national  and \nsubregional programs and projects. Third, PPP offered leadership and general development \nmanagement courses to develop successor generations of Mekong leaders and policy makers.  \n \n8.  The GMS lacks capacity-building institutions that can deliver quality training programs. \nInvesting  in  upgrading  the  skill  levels  of  trainers,  training  organizations  to  international \nstandards, and sustaining these organizations will likely pay the quickest dividends in building \nquality capacity. One concrete way to accomplish this is to establish partnerships between \ninstitutions.  PPP  began  establishing  a  network  of  capacity-building  institutions  intended  to \nencourage sharing best practices, transferring technology, and developing regional centers of \nexcellence in development management in the subregion. While the partnership model is in its \ninfancy, more concrete outcomes are expected in the long term. \n  \n9.  PPP identified the development of GMS intellectual capital to support the subregion\u2019s \ncapacity-building efforts. PPP is partnering with the GMS Academic and Research Network to \ndevelop a GMS research framework and agenda. This framework and agenda will encourage \nacademic research and discourse in the GMS. It will also support policy development at country \nand subregional levels. PPP aims to design and deliver courses anchored substantively in \nindigenous  GMS  research.  The  Plan  commenced  publication  of  the  Journal  of  GMS \nDevelopment Studies5 at the end of 2004. This will provide a platform for sharing research, \nreviewing development literature, and fostering debate.  \n \n                                                 \n5 ADB. Journal of GMS Development Studies. Volume 1. Number 1. December 2004. ", "      3   \n10.  Access to GMS development information will stimulate cross-fertilization of ideas and \nempower people and institutions. Access will establish a pool of knowledge workers in the \nsubregion. A Learning Resource Center established under PPP in Phnom Penh marks the first \nstep in this respect.  \n \n11.  PPP  was  successful  because  of  the  sustained  ownership,  commitment,  and \nparticipation of GMS countries. The Plan established a niche by being one of the very few GMS-\nfocused capacity-building programs with carefully chosen learning topics that promote regional \ncooperation. With the growing complexity of knowledge and skill areas required of civil servants \nfor meeting the needs of national and subregional development, PPP remains relevant and will \nbe needed over the foreseeable future. The current alumni of 300 civil servants are a small \nfragment of the total cohort that needs to be trained. Over time, PPP expects to guide and \nsupport the emergence of sustainable, high-quality capacity-building institutions in the GMS that \nwill cater to the subregion\u2019s needs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The  broad  goal  of  the  Plan  is  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of \ndevelopment management in GMS countries that will enhance economic growth and social \ndevelopment.  PPP  aims  to  accomplish  this  by  developing  a  core  group  of  development \nmanagers and leaders with the capacity to operate as motivated and competent change agents \nwho will manage the complex and challenging GMS development agenda. By the end of the TA, \na further 600 civil servants from the six GMS countries will have been trained and will be \nprovided opportunities to learn, study, know more about each other, and work together in a \ncongenial atmosphere. The growth of the GMS cooperative spirit that will serve as a powerful \ntool in promoting regional cooperation will be further developed. \n \n13.  The specific objectives of PPP are to (i) strengthen technical competence and the \nmanagerial  and  leadership  capacity  of  GMS  middle-  and  senior-level  officials;  (ii)  improve \nmanagement efficiency and effectiveness of national programs and projects; (iii) promote an \nenhanced understanding and awareness of, and cooperative spirit in, the GMS; (iv) reinforce \npartnerships and strengthen cooperation among GMS countries; (v) provide lifelong learning \nopportunities for alumni; (vi) develop institutional capacities through twinning arrangements and \nknowledge sharing and technology transfer between and among capacity-building partners; (vii) \npromote GMS-anchored research and intellectual capital development that will assist capacity-\nbuilding and policy development interventions; and (viii) promote knowledge-sharing activities \nand encourage access to development information.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  PPP has several components and activities premised on capacity building being a long-\nterm process that will require strong commitment and ownership on the part of GMS countries. \nThe PPP program framework was developed with thorough consultation with GMS governments \nand incorporates lessons from the earlier phase. The program will be implemented through \ntested technical methodologies and in close coordination with properly functioning institutional \nmechanisms.  \n \n15.  Demand-Driven Learning Programs. Courses are focused and repeated so that a \ncritical mass will be created. PPP will continue to offer two kinds of learning programs: short \n ", " 4   \ncourses and in-depth programs. Short, high-impact courses are essential for top-level officials \nwho guide policy formulation. High-level workshops and videoconference dialogue form part of \nthe short courses. Up to 16 programs will be offered each year. A GMS Distinguished Speaker \nseries will be conducted. The series will offer opportunities for GMS civil servants to share in the \nexperiences  and  insights  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  figures  in  development,  research,  and \ngovernance.  \n \n16.  Senior- and middle-level officials, who typically develop and implement policies, need \nin-depth courses. PPP offered, and will continue to offer, learning programs on the following \nthemes and topics: governance, leadership, poverty reduction, negotiations, human resource \nmanagement, education management, and trade policy development, as well as private sector \nparticipation, environmental management, regional cooperation, strategic management, public \nhealth  care  management,  electronic  governance,  and  social  protection  systems.  The \nparticipants  will  be  selected  from  relevant  government  ministries,  according  to  strict  but \ntransparent criteria. The number of participants in each learning program will be divided evenly \namong  the  six  GMS  countries.  The  training  program  will  be  mostly  implemented  in  GMS \ncountries.  Each  training  program  will  have  a  maximum  class  size  of  30  participants.  A \nFellowship Program that will provide higher skills development and learning to exceptional PPP \nalumni in world-class institutions will also continue to be offered.  \n \n17.  Core of Greater Mekong Subregion Champions. PPP will continue to create a broad \nbase of qualified development managers through its alumni network. A PPP alumni program \nthat  will  encourage  lifelong  learning  activities  and  support  the  alumni  network  will  be \nestablished. By building on the core of GMS champions that it currently has, PPP intends to \ncreate a multiplier effect to foster capacity building in the GMS. \n \n18.  Intellectual Capital Development.  GMS intellectual capital will be developed through \njoint research activities with the GMS Academic and Research Network and learning materials \ndevelopment and new programs development. The Journal for GMS Development Studies will \nplay a catalytic role in disseminating knowledge and information on the GMS. Twinning of \nresearch and training will be pursued. Nonproprietary learning materials used in PPP programs \nwill be offered on the PPP Web site for broader public use. \n \n19.  Advocacy, Outreach, and Knowledge Sharing. PPP will initiate activities that will \ngenerate  awareness  and  interest  in  PPP.  Events,  publications,  and  activities  encouraging \nnetworking and information technology use will create a platform for dialogue and learning and \nform part of the external relations strategy of PPP. The PPP newsletter will be released thrice a \nyear, and the Web site will continue be the gateway for PPP information. Knowledge-sharing \nactivities  will  be  undertaken  through  learning  resource  centers  and  will  include  research \ndissemination activities. Additional learning resource centers will be established in selected \nGMS countries, subject to demand and resource availability. \n \n20.  Institutional Networking and Development. The current PPP network includes the \nAdministrative Staff College of India; the Asian Institute of Technology; the Economics and \nFinance Institute, Cambodia; the Kunming University of Science and Technology; the Kennedy \nSchool  of  Government  at  Harvard  University;  the  National  University  of  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic; and the Mekong Institute. The Hanoi School of Business, the Viet Nam \nAcademy  of  Social  Sciences,  and  the  National  University  of  Singapore  are  potential  PPP \ncapacity-building partners. These institutions will contribute to the PPP in a variety of ways (e.g., \nprovision of facilities and joint program offerings and knowledge-sharing opportunities). PPP will \nexpand its institutional network and promote sharing best practices, transferring technology, and ", "      5   \ndeveloping regional centers of excellence in development management in the GMS. Institutional \ndevelopment activities with these institutions will be pursued. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost  US$800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed costs estimates are in Appendix 3. Other \nfunding sources for the PPP will be pursued. NZAID has indicated its continued support for the \nprogram. The Government of France has also expressed its intention to participate in the PPP. \nThese  supplemental  sources  of  financing  will be  used  to  finance  activities  not  adequately \ncovered by ADB financing and selectively expand existing activities. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee composed of GMS \nnational coordinators will continue to oversee the operational functions and policy guidelines of \nthe TA. The Deputy Director General in ADB\u2019s Mekong Regional Department will chair the \ncommittee. The day-to-day management of the program will be the responsibility of the PPP \nsecretariat located in ADB headquarters. Each GMS national secretariat will assign a PPP focal \nperson within its government who will work closely with the PPP secretariat. ADB\u2019s resident \nmissions in GMS countries will provide administrative and logistic support to TA activities. \nExisting and new capacity-building partners, as identified over time, will conduct the learning \nprograms in collaboration with PPP.  A PPP advisory board will be established to provide \nstrategic directions, suggest best practices in development management, and provide technical \nguidance in the design and implementation of a GMS research agenda. The board will comprise \nsix individuals who are distinguished in education and capacity building and have significant \nexperience in the Asia and Pacific region. \n23.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  by  individually  recruited  international  and  domestic \nconsultants  who  will  staff  the  PPP  secretariat,  under  the  close  supervision  of  ADB  staff \nmembers. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  Twenty-four  person-months  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  24  person-\nmonths of domestic consultant inputs are anticipated to be required. The outline terms of \nreferences for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n24.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 2 years. The TA is expected to commence \nin March 2005 and be completed in March 2007. Progress will be periodically reviewed by the \nsteering committee. A final review will be undertaken in March 2007. Tracer studies of alumni \nand an impact assessment study of the entire program will be conducted in early 2007. Office \nequipment will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. On completion of the \nTA, all office equipment will be retained by the PPP secretariat and will be used in follow-up \nprograms. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management II and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", " \n6\n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  p\ne\nn\n  d\nix\n         1\n \n  Performance Targets and Indicators     Data Sources/    Assumptions \nDesign Summary    Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n   \nImpact  By  2010 Compared to 2005 Baseline   \u2022  Government statistical and   \n  1.1  Significant improvement in per capita gross  economic reports \nImprove efficiency and  domestic product in  Greater Mekong Subregion  \u2022  Asian Development Bank \neffectiveness of  (GMS) countries  (ADB) annual development \ndevelopment management  1.2  Significant improvement in the quality of   reports  \nin the Greater Mekong  development decisions and enhanced policy- \u2022  World Bank development \nSubregion (GMS) countries   making capacity  reports \n  1.3  Significant improvement in management  \u2022  United Nations Statistical \nperformance  Yearbook \n \n\u2022  Public opinion survey of \ncitizens, government, \nemployees, and development \npartners  \n      Assumptions \nOutcome   By 2010 compared to 2005 baseline   \u2022  ADB mission reviews  \u2022  GMS countries\u2019 continued \n  1.1  Improved effectiveness in program and project  \u2022  Project performance reports  commitment to improving their \nBuild capacity of GMS  planning design and implementation in terms of  \u2022  Reports and statements in  people\u2019s quality of life \ngovernment officials and  quality, impact, cost, and effectiveness  high-level forums (GMS  \u2022  GMS countries continued ability to \ndevelop institutions in the  1.2  Significant improvement in administrative  summit and ministerial  coordinate with each other \nsubregion  efficiency in terms of project implementation and  meetings)   \u2022  GMS countries sustained political \n  progress reporting of ADB-funded national and  \u2022  Special before-and-after study  commitment and support to the \nsubregional projects  on ongoing and completed  Phnom Penh Plan (PPP) \n  1.3  Significant improvement in the institutional  projects   \u2022  Modalities in partnership   \ncapacities of GMS-based education and training  \u2022  Public opinion survey of  arrangements would be effective \ninstitutions  citizens, government,  to ensure technology transfer and \n1.4  Select group of institutions positioned as  employees, and development  knowledge sharing \nregional centers of development management \npartners  \u2022  Sustainability of capacity-building \nexcellence in the GMS   \u2022  Tracer study reports  interventions addressed \n \n\u2022  Independent consultant\u2019s   \n  reports    \n \n\u2022  Learning program reports \n \n(feedback and evaluation \n \nreports) \n \n \n \n ", "             \n     \n       \n  Performance Targets and Indicators     Data Sources/    Assumptions \nDesign Summary    Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n   \n       \nOutputs  1.1 Up to 16 quality demand-driven learning    Assumptions  \n   programs every year and short high-impact  \u2022  Independent consultant\u2019s  \u2022  GMS governments are willing to \n1.

Introduction  \n \n1.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS):  Phnom  Penh  Plan  for  Development \nManagement (PPP) has completed its first 2-year implementation period. Periodic reviews of \nthe PPP were conducted by the steering committee through its various meetings. The PPP \nsecretariat undertook several missions to evaluate the program. Feedback from PPP alumni \nand  reports  submitted  by  PPP  capacity-building  partners  were  consolidated  to  review  the \nprogram. Three major areas were reviewed, and the results are summarized in this paper as \nfollows: (i) PPP\u2019s key success and differentiating factors, (ii) lessons learned and areas for \nimprovement, and (iii) steps that need to be taken to address areas for improvement and \nexpand PPP\u2019s scope in the next 2 years.  \n \nB.  Key Success and Differentiating Factors  \n \n2.  Sustained  Ownership  and  Commitment  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \nCountries. PPP was born out of a request made by GMS leaders at the first GMS Summit of \nLeaders in November 2002. PPP has political commitment at the highest level and is strongly \nsupported by  GMS governments who have explicitly acknowledged PPP\u2019s catalytic role in \nimproving the subregion\u2019s human resources. Senior GMS officials who are members of the PPP \nsteering committee ensure the relevance of the PPP and its responsiveness to their needs.  \n \n3.  Niche-Based Learning. Given the magnitude of the management development task in \nGMS  countries,  PPP  chose  to  be  selective  and  concentrated  on  priority  learning  needs \nidentified in the training needs analysis conducted in October 2003.  All learning programs are \nand will be based on the priority training needs identified, or those that will emerge in the future, \nwhich  include  management-related  and  crosscutting  topics.  Management-related  topics  will \ninclude  leadership  and  strategic  management,  planning,  human  resource  development, \norganization  development,  and  project  management.  Crosscutting  topics  will  include \ngovernance, regional cooperation, private sector development, and special skills. The content of \nthe learning programs include general development management competencies, sector specific \nknowledge,  and  applied  management  skills.  Twenty  courses  were  conducted,  so  far,  in \ncollaboration with PPP\u2019s capacity-building service partners. About 300 middle- and senior-level \nofficials from GMS countries participated in these programs. Of these, over half were at levels \nequivalent to director or higher. Two exceptional alumni were sent to world-class institutions for \nfurther  training.  PPP  does  not  offer  courses  that  are  best  handled  by  capacity-building \ncomponents of sector projects. PPP also does not offer courses readily available in universities \nand business schools. Basic and introductory courses that are widely offered by civil service \ntraining institutions are outside the remit of PPP. This seems to be an appropriate philosophy to \nadopt, given the value-added nature of the program. \n \n4.  Multiplier Effect in Capacity Building. PPP now has a group of 300 middle- and \nsenior-level officials who, after being exposed to new paradigms and cutting-edge management \ntools and concepts, are expected to initiate reforms in their respective institutions. Through the \nalumni network, PPP intends to create a multiplier effect to foster capacity building in the GMS. \nFeedback from participants indicates a high level of motivation to share knowledge and adapt \nskills acquired or strengthened through participation in PPP learning courses.  \n \n5.  Promoting Regional Cooperation. Envisaged as a key instrument to promote regional \ncooperation, PPP has implemented activities that are regional in scope and character. It has ", "  Appendix 2  11   \ncontributed  to  an  enhanced  awareness  of  the  GMS  and,  specifically,  the  GMS  Economic \nCooperation Program. Its alumni represent a variety of organizations and agencies in the GMS \ngovernments. Their coming together to participate in shared learning has fostered friendships \nand bonds and a shared vision for the GMS. Although a seemingly intangible benefit, the growth \nof a cooperative spirit in the GMS is a powerful tool in the subregion\u2019s development that PPP \nlearning programs contribute to. \n \n6.  Broad-Based Partnerships. Owing to the enormity of the capacity-building task and to \nmaximize the involvement of existing and potential institutions, all PPP activities were designed \nand implemented in partnership with other institutions. PPP has begun establishing a network of \ncapacity-building  institutions  intended  to  encourage  joint  learning  programs,  share  best \npractices,  transfer  technology,  and  develop  regional  centers  of  excellence  in  development \nmanagement. Partner institutions are already confirming the benefits of joint work with PPP in \nterms of their own strengthened capacities. \n \n7.  Expanding the Reach and Providing Opportunities to Women. PPP has provided \nopportunities to build capacities in civil servants at the national level and beyond. Officials at the \nprovincial level have participated in learning programs. These officials are actively sought by \nPPP when inviting nominations for courses. Women civil servants are particularly targeted. One \nthird of the PPP alumni are women, and over half of the participants are from the provinces. By \nbuilding capacities at the local level, PPP is contributing to the strengthening of the GMS \ncountries\u2019 decentralization efforts. \n \n8.  Innovative Philosophy. PPP has gone beyond the traditional approach to building \ncapacity. It has provided discussion opportunities on critical development issues. A learning \nresource center in Phnom Penh was established to stimulate dialogue and provide the public \nwith all-that-you-need-to-know information about the GMS. PPP also has a dedicated Web site \nand will develop a portal to enable alumni to maintain lifelong contacts. Apart from a newsletter, \nthe PPP launched a GMS journal of development studies to provide a platform for sharing \nresearch, reviewing development literature, and fostering debate. \n \n9.  Replicability in Other Parts of the Asia and Pacific Region. The Asian Development \nBank\u2019s Pacific Regional Department established a similar capacity-building program for Pacific \ncountries. Regional technical assistance entitled Leadership Enhancement and Advancement \nProgram is modeled after PPP. \n \nC.  Lessons Learned, Areas for Improvement, and Expansion of the Scope of the \nProgram   \n \n10.  Selecting Quality Participants. Constraints are emerging in selecting participants for \nPPP learning programs who are fluent in the English language. Since the number of GMS civil \nservants fluent in English is small, the Governments are finding it difficult to nominate staff \nmembers who meet the course criteria and are also fluent in English. PPP needs to find ways to \nconduct programs that benefit those who are not fluent in English, and doing this in a six-\nlanguage environment will be a challenge.  \n \n11.  Designing Appropriate Course Formats. PPP has offered one learning program in a \ncontinuous format (The Role of Participation in Government and Civil Society). The course was \ndesigned on a modular basis to allow participants to apply on-the-job the information learned \nfrom each module and then return to the course in an interactive way. While GMS countries \nexpressed a preference for the continuous learning program format over the one-off format, this \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \nwas  not  effective.  Many  organizations  did  not  allow  participants  to  return  to  succeeding \nmodules, citing exigencies of duty.  \n \n12.  Institutional Development. While creating a critical mass of development managers \nwho would act as leaders and change agents in their fields is a key element in a GMS capacity-\nbuilding  strategy,  this  alone  is  inadequate.  Strengthening  GMS  education  and  training \ninstitutions that in the long term can address the supply side of capacity building in the GMS is \nneeded. Many institutions of higher learning in the GMS are weak. The fast-track strategy so far \nhas been to twin local with foreign universities. The results have been mixed. PPP can add \nvalue by helping selected local GMS institutions position themselves as centers of excellence in \ndevelopment management in the subregion. This will also support sustainability in the long term.  \n \n13.  Intellectual Capital Development. Weak academic institutions translate into limited \nrelevant and homegrown GMS research. GMS intellectual capital needs to be developed to \nsupport the subregion\u2019s capacity-building requirements. A discrete research agenda needs to be \nestablished and pursued to encourage academic research and discourse in the GMS. PPP aims \nto design and deliver learning programs anchored substantively in homegrown GMS research. \nOther than research relevant to drawing lessons for application in the GMS, research on issues \nof specific concern to the GMS will be particularly relevant for incorporating in GMS capacity-\nbuilding interventions. The GMS Academic and Research Network was established in 2000 to \nproduce and disseminate knowledge in the GMS and aid in policy development. PPP should \nsupport the GMS Academic and Research Network\u2019s research activities.  \n \n14.  Ensuring Development Impact. PPP focuses on short-term training and targeting of \ncritical development areas. However, this needs to be blended with long-term priorities geared \nto achieving internally generated capacities. A sustained intervention will be required. Lifelong \nlearning  programs  for  the  alumni  will  be  needed.  Further,  PPP  needs  to  monitor  the \ndevelopment impact of its alumni. Training alone cannot help build much-needed local capacity. \nBeyond the quantitative measures, qualitative outcomes of capacity-building interventions need \nto be measured. PPP tracer and evaluation studies on the impact of the learning programs to \nthe alumni and their institutions need to be conducted as the next phase of the program nears \ncompletion. \n \n15.  Expanding the Base. PPP learning programs have a variety of themes and topics. On \naverage, each country has four to eight people trained in sector areas and general development \nmanagement. A need exists to expand the base of the so-called sector practitioners to establish \na critical mass of sector experts and development managers in-country. PPP should accomplish \nthis by offering a learning program for at least 3 years.  \n \n16.  Access to Development Information. PPP efforts at enhancing capacities need to \ninclude access to development information. Learning resource centers can serve as focal points \nin sharing knowledge that could support innovative ideas for regional cooperation and informed \ndecision making. Since PPP aims to support effective policy development in the GMS, access to \nquality  knowledge  that  enhances  the  policy-making  capacity  of  GMS  officials  is  needed. \nEstablishing  learning  resource  centers  selectively  can  help  achieve  this  objective.
