During the 2002 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe  Government  of  Kazakhstan  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  local  government \nreform.  Subsequent  programming  missions  and  missions  related  to  the  Governance \nAssessment1 undertaken by ADB in cooperation with the Government, confirmed that reforms in \nthis area are urgently needed. The TA was included in the 2002 Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate for Kazakhstan. It was also agreed that the TA would proceed in two phases. \n \n2.  The TA represents phase I of ADB assistance, and aims to develop a medium-term \nstrategy for local government reforms by resolving basic issues in structuring administrative and \nfinancial relations between the central and local governments. Phase II will provide TA for \nimplementing the recommendations arising from phase I. A Fact-Finding Mission fielded by ADB \nduring 25 June-10 July 2003 reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements for phase I.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Kazakhstan  has  three  levels  of  local  government.  The  oblast-level  governments \nrepresent the 14 regions, and the cities of Astana and Almaty, whose status is similar to that of \nthe regions. The raion-level governments represent the 195 smaller regions and cities, and the \nrural-level governments represent the 2,283 rural districts. The distribution of functions and \nauthorities between these levels is at the discretion of the oblast government, and is often \ncentralized at the oblast level. \n \n4.   The Law on Local Governance (No.148-II, January 2001) provides the legal basis for the \noblast governments. Each oblast government has an executive body called the akimat, which is \nheaded by the akim. According to the law, akims are representatives of the President and the \nGovernment (Constitution Article No. 87) and are appointed by the President. Each oblast also \nhas an elected council, called the maslikhat. The oblast akims appoint the raion akims, and the \nraion akims in turn appoint the village akims. Civil servants working at the local level report both \nto central authorities and the local akimat under what is commonly referred to as the \u201cdual \nsubordination\u201d system. \n \n5.  Oblast governments are generally responsible for building, operating, and maintaining \ntypical  municipal  services,  such  as  transport  infrastructure,  water  and  electricity,  and  law \nenforcement. They also administer health care, education, and poverty reduction programs. \nHowever,  there  is  no  explicit  delineation  of  functions  between  the  Republican  and  local \ngovernments. This results in overlapping of some functions performed by the local offices of the \ncentral government agencies, and those performed by local government bodies dealing with the \ndelivery of similar services. In addition to wasting resources, the overlap and duplication of \nfunctions often create uncertainty regarding accountability.   \n \n6.  Financial relations between central and local governments have been formalized to \nsome degree over the past few years through the adoption of the Law on Budget System, the \nLaw on Local Governance, and the Law on State and State-Guaranteed Borrowing and Debt. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Kazakhstan for Governance Study and Capacity Building for Administrative \nReform. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 2003.   ", "2 \nHowever, a stable and effective framework is still evolving. The local budget is prepared by the \nakim and the relevant members of the akimat. The budget is subject to the Budget System Law, \nand once approved, is consolidated into the national budget. While the initial revenue forecasts \nare prepared at the oblast level, they are often reviewed/amended by central authorities. When \nrevisions are significant, local akimats have difficulties meeting their expenditure assignments. \n \n7.  Differences  in  resource  endowment  and  development  level  result  in  an  uneven \ndistribution of revenue sources among the regions. For example, in 2002 the ratio of per capita \nrevenue of the richest and the poorest oblast was 11.5. An effective mechanism for revenue \nequalization is therefore necessary to ensure equal access to public services for the population.  \nHowever, the existing mechanism for intergovernmental fiscal transfers is not fully effective. As \na result, per capita expenditures on social services such as health and education between \nregions show significant imbalances. \n \n8.  In acknowledging these concerns, the Government has made local government reforms \none  of  its  top  priorities.  The  draft  Law  on  Local  Self-Government  recently  submitted  to \nParliament  envisages  local  governments  as  separate  legal  entities.  The  Government  has \nestablished the State Commission for Delineation of Authorities Between Levels of Government \nand  Improvement  of  Intergovernment  Fiscal  Relations  (State  Commission),  headed  by  the \nPrime Minister and managed by a working group of representatives from key ministries. The \nState Commission has prepared the Concept for Delineation of Authorities Between Levels of \nGovernment  and  Improvement  of  Intergovernment  Fiscal  Relations  (Concept).  Highlighting \nweaknesses in the current allocation of responsibilities among various levels of government and \nthe methodologies for intergovernmental fiscal transfers, the Concept stipulates that each level \nof government be assigned clearly defined functions, and supported by adequate financial \nresources. The Concept has been approved by the President and adopted by the Government \nthrough Resolution No. 147, February 2003.  While the development of the Concept provides a \ngood starting point, the Government is keenly aware that the reform process will be long and \ncomplex, and that a well-developed strategy for implementing the reforms is needed. The TA \nwill  assist  the  Government  by  developing  frameworks  for  functional  and  financial  relations \nbetween various levels of government, and outlining a detailed strategy for sequencing and \nphasing necessary reforms. \n \n9.  ADB has undertaken a comprehensive Governance Assessment of Kazakhstan in close \ncooperation with the Government (footnote 1). The assessment emphasizes the urgency of \nlocal government reform and accordingly proposes ADB assistance during the reform process.  \n \n10.  ADB has coordinated closely with Kazakhstan\u2019s other development partners. In the past \nthe United Nations Development Program has been involved in developing the Civil Service \nLaw  and  in  conducting  functional  reviews  of  specific  line  ministries.  The  projects  of  the \nEuropean Union Technical Assistance for Commonwealth of Independent States (EU-TACIS) \nare focused on civil service training, including an ongoing large-scale project aimed at training \ntrainers  in  all  oblasts.  Under  its  Fiscal  Reform  Project,  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (USAID)  has  provided  considerable  support  for  implementing \nprogram budgeting, developing an improved budget code, and improving budget administration. \nUSAID  is  also  providing  technical  assistance  for  enhancing  the  transparency  of \nintergovernmental fiscal transfers by developing models for estimating the revenue-generating \ncapacity and the expenditure needs of each oblast. Given the relevance of this work, ADB will \ncontinue to coordinate closely with USAID during TA implementation. However, ADB\u2019s efforts \nwill focus more broadly on intergovernmental functional and financial relations as they relate to ", "    3 \ndecentralization, and on developing a strategy for implementing necessary reforms over the \nmedium term. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.   The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  developing  a  medium-term  strategy  for  local \ngovernment reforms by resolving basic issues in structuring central-local government relations. \nThe outputs will be (i) a functional framework for improving the division of responsibilities \nbetween  various  levels  of  government;  (ii)  a  financial  framework  for  improving  local \ngovernments\u2019  capacity  to  effectively  undertake  their  expenditure  responsibilities;  and  (iii)  a \nmedium-term strategy for implementing local government reforms.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will undertake the following: \n \n1.  Develop a Functional Framework  \n \n13.  This activity will entail \n   \n(i)  conducting a functional analysis of public service delivery in selected oblasts, \nand   identifying remaining inefficiencies and constraints; \n \n(ii)  reviewing the division of responsibilities among various levels of government in \nlight of the Concept developed by the Government; \n \n(iii)  making  recommendations,  identifying  specific  conditions  and  criteria  for  the \noptimal delegation of responsibilities among various levels of government; and \n \n(iv)  making  recommendations  for  managing  the  traditional  system  of  \u201cdual \nsubordination\u201d of civil servants, and for improving accountability at each level of \ngovernment.   \n  \n2.  Develop a Financial Framework  \n \n14.  This activity will entail \n \n(i)  reviewing expenditure and revenue arrangements in selected oblasts; \n \n(ii)  outlining  current  procedures  for  revenue-sharing  among  oblasts,  vertical  and \nhorizontal fiscal transfers between governments, intergovernmental loans, and \nmarket borrowing by local governments; \n \n(iii)  reviewing the potential for improving local-level tax administration, and expanding \nthe revenue base to reduce local governments\u2019 dependence on fiscal transfers; \nand  \n ", "4 \n(iv)  making specific proposals for allocating revenue sources in line with expenditure \nassignments at each level of government. \n \n3.  Develop  a  Medium-Term  Strategy  for  Implementing  Local  Government \nReforms \n \n15.  This activity will entail \n \n(i)  outlining alternative transition paths for decentralization and local government \nreforms, using (1) and (2) and incorporating relevant international experience; \n \n(ii)  elaborating the legal and institutional changes involved in each transition path; \n \n(iii)  detailing sequencing and phasing of reforms under each transition path; and \n \n(iv)  conducting a workshop with participation from central and local governments and \nother local representatives, to discuss the transition strategy and medium-term \naction. \n. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $358,000 equivalent comprising $210,000 in  \nforeign  exchange,  and  $148,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $250,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost of \n$210,000 and $40,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis from the Governance Cooperation Fund3 ($100,000) and ADB\u2019s TA funding program \n($150,000). The Government will finance the remaining $108,000 equivalent. Detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning (MEBP) will be the Executing Agency, \nand will provide necessary logistical support, workshop facilities, and counterpart staff. The TA \nwill be implemented over a period of 8 months, beginning November 2003.
