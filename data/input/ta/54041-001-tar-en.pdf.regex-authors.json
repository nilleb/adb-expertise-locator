INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will improve the capacity of selected \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  applying \ndifferentiated approaches in context-sensitive situations.1 Context-sensitive situation is a broader \ndefinition  of  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations  (FCAS)  that  also  encompasses  defined \ngeographical areas in upper-middle-income countries with population segments that experience \npersistent poverty caused by fragility and conflict. \n \n2.  Context-sensitive situations are intended to go beyond FCAS classification2 (i) to consider \nthe distinct challenges that DMCs may face in achieving development objectives in defined \ngeographical areas;  and (ii) to improve the effectiveness of ADB assistance in those areas, in \nline with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 goal to promote inclusiveness in lagging areas and pockets \nof poverty, and the related seven Operational Plans.3  \n \n3.  The TA will (i) review and update ADB\u2019s 2013 FCAS operational plan,4 (ii) operationalize \ndifferentiated approaches to context-sensitive situations, and (iii) support trainings and innovative \nknowledge-based approaches. Through these components, ADB will help DMCs progress along \nthe fragility-to-stability continuum.5  \n \n4.  The  TA  concept  was  endorsed  during  the  corporate  priority  framework  meeting  in \nNovember 2019 and is included in the 2020 ADB Management-approved results-based work plan \nof the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC).6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Strategy 2030 recognizes that fragile and conflict-affected countries \u201cface a high degree \nof  fragility  and  a  considerable  need  for  institutional  strengthening,\u201d  and  advocates  for  a \ndifferentiated  approach  to  how  ADB  operates  in  such  situations. 7  FCAS  countries  are \ncharacterized by political instability; weak governance and institutional capacity; economic and \nsocial insecurity; greater vulnerability to the effects of climate change; and, in the case of small \nisland  developing  states  (SIDS),  remoteness  and  isolation.  The  broader  context-sensitive \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  Countries are classified FCAS using a harmonized approach agreed with the World Bank, the African Development \nBank and ADB. In the Asia and the Pacific region, the harmonized approach uses an average of ADB\u2019s country \nperformance assessment and the World Bank\u2019s country policy and institutional assessment. Countries rated below \n3.2 on a scale of 0\u20136, or those with a United National or regional peacekeeping or peace building mission in the \nprevious 3 years, are classified FCAS. For 2019, the following ADB member countries were classified FCAS: \nAfghanistan and Myanmar were conflict-affected; and the following Pacific small islands developing states (the \nFederated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, Solomon \nIslands, and Tuvalu) were classified fragile. ADB monitors Vanuatu as it is close to the fragile classification cutoff of \n3.2. \n3  Footnote 1, para. 30, p. 13. \n4  ADB. 2013. Operational Plan for Enhancing ADB\u2019s Effectiveness in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations. Manila. \nAt the Second Asian Development Fund 13 Replenishment Meeting in February 2020, ADB committed to reviewing \nand updating the 2013 operational plan to align it with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. \n5  Footnote 4, p. 5. Fragility and conflict can best be understood as a continuum, with countries that may face violence \nand extreme state failure at one end and countries that are in transitional situations and moving toward stable \nsituations at the other end.  \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 March 2020. \n7  Footnote 1, para. 26, p. 12. \n ", "2 \napproach will address the specificities and underlying causes of vulnerability of DMCs in defined \ngeographical areas\u2014beyond those countries classified as FCAS (footnote 2)\u2014and will help ADB \nimprove its operational effectiveness in those areas. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s differentiated approach to FCAS recognizes that fragility and conflict are complex \nand  multifaceted.8 Countries  experiencing  context-sensitive  situations  confront  obstacles  to \ndevelopment that other DMCs may not face or may be better positioned to overcome. To \nsuccessfully operate in these situations, ADB follows international best practices based on (i) \nensuring  context  sensitivity,  (ii)  doing  no  harm,  (iii)  increasing  capacity  assistance  and \ndevelopment, (iv) enhancing monitoring for continuous improvement, and (v) seeking progress \non the fragility-to-stability continuum.  \n7.  ADB has put considerable effort in supporting fragile and country affected countries since \n2007, when the differentiated approach for weakly-performing countries (later identified as FCAS) \nwas adopted. Then, in 2013, the FCAS Operational Plan (footnote 4) was approved and continues \ncurrently to guide ADB operations in FCAS. Much of ADB\u2019s FCAS operations and experience is \nin the Pacific region, as eight SIDS in the Pacific are classified as FCAS. ADB\u2019s operations \ndepartments, including the Private Sector Operations Department, and resident missions are \ncharged with the implementation of the differentiated approaches. \n8.  Two corporate evaluation reports have provided insights and recommendations on ADB\u2019s \noperations  in  FCAS.9 These  evaluations  noted  that  common  factors  are  affecting  project \nperformances  in  FCAS  countries,  namely,  inadequate  understanding  of  the  underlying \ndevelopment problem; limited or overestimation of institutional capacity to achieve project outputs \nand outcomes; and poor government coordination, which places a substantial burden on national \ninstitutions. The reports also emphasized the need to increase project implementation capacity. \n9.  ADB assistance to FCAS DMCs has increased over the years. The FCAS portfolio grew \nfrom $4.5 billion in 2015 to $6.9 billion in 2019, to represent 7% of ADB\u2019s sovereign portfolio. ADB \nincreased its overall allocations to FCAS DMCs in the Asian Development Fund (ADF) 12th \nreplenishment  by  more  than  40%  compared  to  ADF  11. 10  Yet,  despite  some  positive \nperformances, success rates of projects in FCAS countries have recently declined. Only 54% of \nthe  sovereign  operations  completed  in  FCAS  countries  were  rated  successful  in  2019. 11 \nPerformances in FCAS DMCs dropped by 19 percentage points in 2017\u20132019 after an all-time \nhigh of 73% in 2016\u22122018 .12 The causes of the decline\u2014exacerbated by national or subnational \nconflicts, or by size and remoteness in the case of SIDS\u2014range from weak governance and \ninstitutions, to deficient government transparency, to knowledge and capacity gaps. Ensuring that \nthe outputs and outcomes of ADB-financed operations in fragile situations are sustainable \nremains a critical challenge.  \n10.  Achieving  development  and  progress  on  the  fragility-to-stability  continuum  requires \novercoming  basic  fragility  and  improving  state  capacity  to  promote  social  and  economic \nintegration.  Improving  development  effectiveness  in  context-sensitive  situations  requires  a \ndetailed understanding of the sources of conflict and fragility and a differentiated approach, with \n \n8  ADB. 2012.

In an effort to support Strategy 2030, an FCAS team was established in August 2019 in \nSDCC to serve as the corporate focal.13 Going forward, the TA will support government officials \nand development practitioners to facilitate and manage the implementation of context-sensitive \ninitiatives and sustainable actions. The TA will also complement existing initiatives to address \nfragile situations in Pacific SIDS,14 similar TA projects in Afghanistan15 and Myanmar,16 and other \nrelevant TA projects in operations departments and SDCC.17 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: resilience of DMCs affected by FCAS \nimproved (ADB Strategy 2030) (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: performance \nof DMCs integrating context-sensitive approach improved.18 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Strategic approach to context-sensitive situations developed. To better \nsupport DMC governments to address challenges brought about by contextual sensitivities \nincluding fragility and/or conflict, the TA will help review and expand the 2013 FCAS Operational \nPlan (footnote 4) into a broader context-sensitive approach. The approach will be aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and will reflect international and region-specific best practices. The review \nwill  be  based  on:  (i)  the  Pacific  Department\u2019s  assessment  of  its  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u2013\n2020 19and internal review of the FCAS Operational Plan to identify which actions have been \nsuccessfully  implemented  and  which  need  further  attention;  and  (ii)  context-sensitive \ndevelopment issues identified through a process of consultations with DMCs. To enable DMCs to \nperform better, the review will also look at strategic and operational aspects of DMCs\u2019 and ADB\u2019s  \napproaches, including their responses to coronavirus disease 2019, and will identify policies, \nprocesses, and procedures (e.g., partnership strategies, project design processes, financial \nmanagement, procurement and safeguard requirements) that may need to be revised to facilitate \nimproved operations and more sustainable and resilient results in context-sensitive situations. \nRecognizing that border areas are often flash points for fragility and conflict, the TA will support \n \n13 The FCAS team is led by a director-level staff member and serves as the corporate focal point to support, facilitate, \nand manage the implementation of the context-sensitive approach. The team will support the implementation of the \ninitiatives, actions, and activities outlined in the strategic approach paper and lead the collaboration with external \ndevelopment partners and stakeholders to facilitate the sharing of experiences and knowledge. \n14 ADB. 2018.

Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "4 \nprocesses and approaches to facilitate and boost regional cooperation and integration. The \napproach will include crosscutting issues such as gender inequality, expanding civil society \nengagement,  and  youth  inclusion;  and  will  endeavor  to  create  a  platform  to  improve  the \ncoordination of ADB support for context-sensitive situations. The approach will also support \nSustainable Development Goals 16 (promote just, peaceful, and inclusive societies) and 17 \n(revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development),and highlight the crosscutting \nissues with the ADB\u2019s seven operational plans, including the private sector.20 The TA will engage \nDMCs through policy dialogue and broad consultations in updating the approach to fit local \nsituations. The context-sensitive approach, which will be compiled in a strategic approach paper \nto FCAS, will include performance indicators to track and monitor progress in implementing the \nstrategic approach and will provide the overall strategy for addressing contextual issues in the \nentire Asia and Pacific region.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Context-sensitive differentiated approaches incorporated in programs \nand projects. The TA will support selected DMCs with context-sensitive situations to design and \nimplement projects and programs that best respond to local situations. The TA will provide expert \nguidance and upstream advisory support services to country teams for the formulation of country \npartnership strategies, project pipeline development, and new project designs. The TA will provide \nat least five DMCs with, among others, expertise in governance, public sector and financial \nmanagement, procurement, anticorruption, gender, climate change, and capacity and institutional \ndevelopment across sectors and themes (e.g., energy, health, transport, urban development, \nwater, and environment). The TA will support the preparation of fragility and conflict assessments, \nincluding stakeholder analyses, and will employ participatory development processes as they \napply to context-sensitive situations. In addition, recognizing that effective response in context-\nsensitive situations depends on the availability of timely information about local conditions, the TA \nteam will prepare situation analyses and briefs for selected DMCs to monitor potential adverse \nsituations. These briefs will be updated regularly to ensure that they remain relevant.  \n15.  Output 3: Context-sensitive innovative knowledge-based products and services \ncreated and disseminated.  The TA team will carry out an initial scoping of the knowledge base \non context-sensitive approaches in at least 10 DMCs. This will help gain a deeper understanding \nof issues and identify successful approaches and tools, including those used by regional and \nglobal development partners such as the World Bank, that can be continued and/or replicated \nwhen engaging in context-sensitive situations. Knowledge gaps gleaned from the scoping activity \nwill be addressed with the intent of developing innovative knowledge-based solutions tailored to \nlocal  conditions.  An  online  resource  center,  accessible  to  DMCs,  development  partners, \nnongovernment organizations, and others, will serve as a hub for knowledge dissemination and \nsharing. The TA will support the development of a monitoring tool for context-sensitive situations \nin Asia and the Pacific. The TA will also undertake training needs analyses for line ministries in \nselected DMCs to scope and design capacity-building activities for government officials and \ndevelopment practitioners. Inclusive training will support government officials and counterparts to \ngain capacity and unveil solutions to strengthening institutions, catalyzing change, and piloting \ninnovative approaches in learning and knowledge sharing. The TA team will develop training and \nawareness materials and carry out integrated workshops and seminars for single DMCs and for \ntargeted groups. The TA team will organize a regional event to address context-sensitive issues \nin Asia and the Pacific and enable countries to share knowledge and best practices with a special \nattention to gender inequalities and exclusions. \n \n \n20 ADB. 2019.
