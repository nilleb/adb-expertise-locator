Intraregional activities\u2014in trade and investment, money and \nfinance, infrastructure development, and regional public goods\u2014have benefited from the closer \nlinks being forged. Pushed by market forces and closer interdependence, especially through \ncross-border production networks, regionalism in Asia and the Pacific has made substantial \nprogress, particularly after the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98 which was a major trigger for \nregional cooperation. However, as economies in Asia and the Pacific are becoming closer and \nmembers of regional organizations see the advantages of speaking a common voice in global \nforums, the region lacks effective institutional arrangements for intergovernmental cooperation.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2008 flagship study, Emerging Asian Regionalism, \nidentified a need to enhance the institutional capabilities for regional cooperation in Asia and the \nPacific.1 It is now time to fill in the knowledge gap and study the issues at stake. Such study is \nneeded since Asia and the Pacific require more extensive institutionalization as it develops an \nappetite for deeper regional economic integration and cooperation. The challenge is to strike a \nbalance between supranational authority, regional cooperation, and national autonomy. This \nrequires designing regional cooperation and integration (RCI) institutions that are both strong \nand flexible, ensuring a balance between their independence and accountability. Providing \nbroad guidelines and filling in the details are the main objectives of this study. \n \n3.  The research and development technical assistance (TA) seeks to take stock of existing \nRCI institutions in Asia and the Pacific, assess the efficiency and effectiveness of some of the \nmost significant ones, and offer concrete policy recommendations for regional members to \nstreamline or consolidate existing RCI institutions and arrangements, strengthen their structure \nand operations, and explore and identify if new institutions or initiatives are needed.2 The TA will \nbenefit from collaboration across ADB between the Office of Regional Economic Integration \n(OREI), other knowledge departments, and all regional departments, in defining the structure \nand implementation arrangements of the study, and reviewing existing institutions for regional \ncooperation in subregions of Asia and the Pacific. The TA design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  So far, economies in Asia and the Pacific have steered clear of a European-style focus \non strong institutions, preferring to adopt a more pragmatic, bottom-up approach to economic \nintegration. These characteristics, however, have their limitations. The absence of formal rules, \nprocedures, and obligations for members, not to mention agencies overseeing compliance and \nenforcement,  has  sometimes  created  problems.  This  is  especially  true  where  eliciting \ncooperation  has  the  character  of  a  prisoner\u2019s  dilemma\u2014each  country  benefits  if  everyone \ncoordinates to achieve cooperative equilibrium. However, with inadequate sharing of information \nand reluctance to commit, individual governments may decide to diverge from the cooperative \nequilibrium, leaving everyone worse off.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Emerging Asian Regionalism: A Partnership for Shared Prosperity. Manila. \n2  A list (not comprehensive) of existing RCI institutions in Asia and the Pacific is in ADB. 2008. Emerging Asian \nRegionalism: A Partnership for Shared Prosperity. Manila (Table A7.1, pp. 256\u2013259). \n3  The TA concept paper was cleared on 12 December 2008. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB\u2019s website on 4 May 2009. \n ", "2   \n5.  This study sees regional institutions as mechanisms for providing the information and \ncommitment needed to support cooperative equilibrium. They range from implicit norms and \nunderstandings about the nature of acceptable behavior (\u201cweak institutionalization\u201d) to explicit \nrules and obligations with compliance monitored by a standing body or secretariat (\u201cstrong \ninstitutionalization\u201d).  Asia  and  the  Pacific  so  far  has  opted  for  weak  institutionalization  of \nregionalism. There are few institutions for regional cooperation with a proper secretariat, and \nthose that exist are not strong enough to be effective. The mandate they receive from national \nagencies is quite limited; their governance structure, rules, and norms are often not well defined; \nand in some cases they lack qualified staff. Given this vacuum of RCI institutions, it is difficult for \nAsia and the Pacific to shape a regional agenda as individual countries are often reluctant to \nlead regional initiatives, or have difficulty adopting other countries\u2019 proposals.  \n \n6.  Enhancing  the  capacity  of  RCI  institutions  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  is  particularly \nimportant, given the need to shape a new global economic and financial architecture that \nreflects regional priorities. This is especially pertinent at this time of global economic crisis. To \nhelp Asia and the Pacific reach this goal, more research is needed to link existing theoretical \ncontributions  from  political  science  and  economics  with  the  historical,  political,  and  social \nconditions of economies in Asia and the Pacific; the ongoing debate on reshaping the global \nfinancial architecture; and concrete possibilities to strengthen existing RCI institutions in Asia \nand the Pacific, and create new ones. \n \n7.  RCI institutions in Asia and the Pacific lack the extensive common rules, norms, and \nobligations\u2014enforced by formal, permanent intergovernmental and supranational structures\u2014\nsuch as those in Europe. The European Union has a broad range of formal obligations to which \nboth aspiring and existing members must adhere. Compliance with such set of rules and other \nmembership obligations is monitored by agencies such as the European Commission (EC). \nAlthough less institutionalized than in Europe, regional economic cooperation in Asia and the \nPacific  involves  some  shared  rules  and  obligations,  with  compliance  fostered  by  standing \ninstitutions. For instance, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)4 \nhave committed to create a free trade area (FTA) and an economic community within which \ngoods, labor, and foreign investment will flow freely by 2015. Although the ASEAN Secretariat \noversees the FTA\u2019s operation and progress toward the ASEAN economic community, trade \ndisputes are usually solved bilaterally without going through the authority of the Secretariat, \ndespite a dispute settlement mechanism was created in 1996. \n \n8.  The  members  of  ASEAN+3\u2014ASEAN  plus  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and \nRepublic of Korea\u2014have committed to extend financial swaps through the Chiang Mai Initiative \n(CMI), which was launched in May 2000 and continues to evolve. In February 2009, ASEAN+3 \ncountries agreed to establish an independent unit in conjunction with the multilateralization of \nthe  CMI  to  monitor  national  policies,  conduct  regional  surveillance,  and  reassure  lending \ncountries on borrowing countries\u2019 capacity to meet repayment conditions. The progress of \nASEAN+3 financial cooperation\u2014including the CMI\u2014is monitored through reports submitted by \nthe ASEAN Finance and Macroeconomic Surveillance Unit. ADB has a structured program for \nregional cooperation itself with its own budget, permanent staff, and formal rules. \n \n9.  The new financial architecture that is taking shape on the wake of the ongoing global \neconomic crisis raises several important questions for Asia and the Pacific. Is the political \nenvironment conducive to strengthening institutions for regionalism? What type of governance \n                                                 \n4 ASEAN has the following 10 members: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n ", "    3 \nstructure  should  these  institutions  follow?  Should  Asia  and  the  Pacific  create  a  regional \nbureaucracy with a strong secretariat? Are there lessons from Europe and other regions? What \nis the benefit to countries in Asia and the Pacific for participating in subregional, regional, and \nglobal institutions? These are the key questions this TA will attempt to answer.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  This TA aims to conduct a study for improving awareness among policy makers of the \nimportance of RCI institutions in Asia and the Pacific, and enhancing the institutions' capabilities \nto promote RCI initiatives. The study is expected to generate robust discussion among experts \non  whether  existing  RCI  institutions  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  need  to  be  strengthened  or \nstreamlined, if new ones need to be created, or if the status quo is optimal.  \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be ultimately measured by the increased effectiveness of RCI \ninstitutions in Asia and the Pacific to promote regional priorities in the new economic and \nfinancial architecture that will take shape in the wake of the global economic crisis. This will \nrequire better coordination of the policy dialogue and interaction among regional members. It \nwill also imply timely and articulated responses for Asia and the Pacific to economic issues that \nhave  regional  and  global  implications.  The  study  will  facilitate  the  underlying  process  for \nenhancing RCI institutions in Asia and the Pacific by improving the understanding of several \nimportant  issues,  including  the  political  and  economic  circumstances  under  which  the \ninstitutions were created, their membership issues, governance structure, and scope and range \nof activities.  \n \n12.  The outcome of the TA will be the provision of concrete policy recommendations and \nsuggestions to policy makers in Asia and the Pacific to improve the efficiency and effectiveness \nof RCI institutions. The study will include proposals for enhancing RCI institutions in Asia and \nthe Pacific. It will review the relevant analytical literature, make an inventory and assessment of \nexisting RCI institutions in Asia and the Pacific, and discuss how the experience of Asia and the \nPacific compares with that of RCI institutions elsewhere in the world. The study report will be \npublished in the form of a book, including the study highlights and an executive summary. \nUltimately, the utility and relevance of the study will help bolster ADB\u2019s reputation as a primary \nknowledge institution on RCI in Asia and the Pacific. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The study will comprehensively list and assess existing RCI institutions in Asia and the \nPacific,  discuss  issues  related  to  their  governance,  compare  regional  experiences,  distill \npertinent lessons from history, and offer policy recommendations to fill the institutional deficit.  \n \n14.  The study will take stock of work previously done inside and outside ADB on RCI \ninstitutions in Asia and the Pacific, and complement ADB\u2019s Emerging Asian Regionalism study. \nOREI will work in close collaboration with other ADB knowledge departments and with all \nregional departments in dealing with the RCI institutions pertaining to the various subregions of \nAsia and the Pacific. A detailed analysis of primary-source data will be obtained through surveys \nand interviews conducted with existing regional institutions, key national agencies, and opinion \nleaders from academia, government, business, and media.  \n \n15.  The  study  will  include  about  22  background  papers  authored  by  well-known \ninternational scholars that will be used as inputs for the preparation of the TA final report. The \n ", "4   \ndraft  papers  will  be  discussed  in  various  technical  workshops  organized  from  June  to \nDecember 2009. Three workshops will be organized to structure the three sections of the study: \n(i) governance issues, (ii) regional comparisons, and (iii) inventory and assessment of RCI \ninstitutions in Asia and the Pacific. The background papers' first drafts will be discussed in a \nmidterm  review  workshop  in  August  2009.  The  papers'  revised  and  final  versions  will  be \npresented  in  a  study  finalization  workshop  in  December  2009.  A  workshop  will  also  be \norganized in September 2009 to discuss issues related to the assessment of RCI institutions in \nAsia and the Pacific. The background papers will cover issues related but not limited to the \nfollowing topics: (i) history and evolution of Asian RCI institutions, (ii) contract design for RCI \ninstitutions,  (iii)  evolution  and  dynamics  of  RCI  institutions  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  (iv) \ncoordination  between  national  and  regional  RCI  institutions,  (v) RCI  institutions  and \nmechanisms  to  compensate  losers  of  RCI  activities,  (vi) constitutionalism  and  regional \norganizations, (vii) FTAs for regional financial cooperation, (viii) regional institution building and \neconomic crises, (ix) domestic politics and receptivity to regional institutions, (x) historical \ncomparison of European integration models, (xi) role of judicial and quasi-judicial institutions, \n(xii) membership criteria and government behavior: club versus convoy models, (xiii) Latin \nAmerican models of economic integration, (xiv) regional organizations and promotion of rule of \nlaw, (xv) organizing the wider East Asian region\u2014from the East Asia Economic Group to East \nAsia Summit, (xvi) regional institutions in Northeast Asia, (xvii) regional institutions in Southeast \nAsia, (xviii) regional institutions in Central Asia, (xix) regional institutions in South Asia, (xx) \nshaping  the  new  regionalism  in  the  Pacific  islands,  (xxi)   institutions  for  Asia\u2019s  financial \ncooperation, and (xxii) institutions for regional cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n16.  The TA final report will be drafted in early 2010 and published as a book in the second or \nthird quarter of the year. The draft final report outline is in Appendix 2. A prepublication version \nof  the  study  will  be  prepared  for the  2010  ADB  Annual  Meeting  (May),  together  with  the \nexecutive summary and highlights. The executive summary and highlights will be translated into \nfour languages: Bahasa Indonesia, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. After the book publication, \na series of international conferences will be jointly organized with national and international \nagencies to disseminate the study outcomes to wide audiences, promoting discussion of the \nissues included in paras. 4\u20139 to a large range of stakeholders and media.5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA will cost an estimated $1,500,000. The Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFund  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership  Facility6  will \nprovide a grant to finance the TA. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, managed by OREI. The TA is expected to \nbe carried out over a period of 24 months, from May 2009 to April 2011. OREI will finalize the \nstudy outcome, structure, and implementation arrangements following the advice of a steering \ncommittee, composed of ADB management representatives. Invited members of the steering \ncommittee will be the managing director general (chair) and director generals of regional and \nknowledge departments. The steering committee will function as an advisory and quality control \nbody. It will (i) ensure that the study is relevant to a wide range of developing member countries, \n                                                 \n5 Given the scope of the analysis, the study conducted under this TA will be an appropriate follow-up to ADB. 2008. \nEmerging Asian Regionalism: A Partnership for Shared Prosperity. \n6 Established by ADB. \n ", "    5 \n(ii) finalize the project timeline, and (iii) promote participation of ADB staff in the study. The RCI \nCommunity of Practice will serve as the ADB internal vehicle to discuss and implement the \nstudy across various departments and receive inputs from staff. An external review and advisory \nboard, including international experts on RCI institutions, will be created to ensure the quality of \nthe study. Members of this board will be invited to attend workshops and other meetings to \nprovide  comments  and  suggestions  on  the  study  structure,  its  focus,  and  more  detailed \ncomments on background papers. Members of the board will only be remunerated when invited \nto participate in workshops and other activities as resource persons. \n \n19.  The TA will require 72 person-months of international consulting services, 50 person-\nmonths of national consulting services, and 5 person-months of resource persons\u2019 services. The \nexpertise of consultants ranges from political science to economics, and includes editors as well \nas surveying firms, workshop facilitators, and project administrators. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Except as provided below, all consultants will be selected on an \nindividual basis as a wide range of experts will be required. Coordination and administrative \nsupport will be carried out directly by OREI. The terms of reference for consultants and resource \npersons are in Appendix 4. Single source selection will be used to engage two surveying firms \n(TNS Asia and the Secretariat of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, both located in \nSingapore) because of their unique expertise in the area. Total engagement will be about 3 \nperson-months. To facilitate the workshops\u2019 organization and translation services, the Project \nmay also engage firms using single source selection because of the small contract amount. \nIdentification of firms and other arrangements will be subject to consultation with ADB resident \nmissions.  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and turned over or disposed of (after TA \ncompletion) in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and \nOffice of Administrative Services. \n \n20.  The TA main report will be drafted by a team of four core consultants, including one \nlead, and three principal consultants. While the lead consultant will be responsible for the overall \nstudy, each of the three principal consultants will be mainly responsible for the three sections of \nthe study on governance issues, regional comparisons, and inventory and assessment of RCI \ninstitutions  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  principal  consultants  will  also  be  responsible  for \nsuggesting prominent scholars to write the background papers. Surveys will be conducted in \ncollaboration with international organizations and/or through private firms to gather primary data \nfrom opinion leaders in Asia and the Pacific on issues related to RCI institutions. A team of \nnational consultants will be hired to ensure smooth implementation of the TA. These include a \nproject coordinator and an editorial team to work on the publications that will be produced by the \nstudy. In addition, the TA will engage several resource persons to serve as discussants in the \nworkshops and prepare short papers and issue briefs, as necessary. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 financed on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation \nand  Integration  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  for  Institutions  for  Regionalism:  Enhancing \nEconomic Cooperation and Integration in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or \nAssumptions and Risks \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nRCI institutions in Asia  Timely and articulated  Number of articles in the  Strong collaboration \nand the Pacific promote  responses from Asia  press and academic  between ADB and other  RCI \nregional priorities more  and the Pacific to  journals referring to the  institutions in Asia and the \neffectively in the new  economic issues that  importance of RCI  Pacific \nglobal economic and  have regional and  institutions in Asia and the   \nfinancial architecture  global impact   Pacific  Risks \n      Misperception of ADB \n  Effectiveness of policy  Discussion on enhancing  engaging in noneconomic \ndialogue and interaction  the effectiveness of RCI  activities \namong  countries in  institutions in Asia and the   \nAsia and the Pacific  Pacific included in the  Changing political and \nagenda of national,  macroeconomic conditions in \nregional, and international  the region may not favor \nagencies working on RCI- prioritizing regional \nrelated issues   cooperation \n \nFeedback from scholars, \nADB stakeholders, and RCI \ninstitutions in Asia and the \nPacific \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nConcrete policy  Number of governing  Citations from meetings and  RCI institutions in Asia and \nrecommendations and  bodies of RCI  reports of RCI institutions in  the Pacific as well as \nsuggestions to policy  institutions in Asia and  Asia and the Pacific  relevant national and global \nmakers in Asia and the  the Pacific that consider    agencies collaborate to \nPacific  the study  Records of RCI institutions  provide data and information \n  recommendations  in Asia and the Pacific   \n    Leaders in Asia and the \nNumber of RCI  Feedback from members of  Pacific recognize the need to \ninstitutions in Asia and  RCI institutions in Asia and  enhance capabilities of RCI \nthe Pacific being  the Pacific  institutions and their \nproposed, created,    effectiveness \nstrengthened, or  Embedment of best    \nstreamlined   practices dissemination and  Risk \n  lessons learned from other   \nNumber of capacity  subregions in ADB regional  Domestic, regional, and \nbuilding projects and  departments' programs to  global crises (political, \nother initiatives taken  support RCI institutions in  economic, social) \nby ADB  to enhance  Asia and the Pacific   \neffectiveness of RCI   \ninstitutions in Asia and  Feedback from ADB staff \nthe Pacific  and departments  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nResearch schedule and  Feedback from members  of  Availability of and interest \n1.

The research and development technical assistance (TA) will provide services from \ninternational consultants, national consultants, and resource persons. International (lead and \nprincipal) consultants will assist in preparing the analytical and policy studies and some of the \nbackground papers used as inputs to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) report. They will also \nassist in gathering authors of background papers and organizing some of the workshops related \nto the specific sections of the study. Research assistants will help international consultants in \ntheir workstations to gather relevant material for the study. The background papers will be \nanalytical and policy studies that offer a synthesis of the existing literature and develop new \nparadigms  and  ideas  related  to  the  strengthening  and  streamlining  of  existing  regional \ncooperation and integration (RCI) institutions and creation of new RCI institutions in Asia and \nthe Pacific. Academic institutions will help organize some of the workshops and seminars held \noutside ADB headquarters.
