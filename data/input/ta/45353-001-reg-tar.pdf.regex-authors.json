INTRODUCTION \n1.  This technical assistance (TA) will help the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan \nsolve their water problems through the development of a water resources sector strategy in \neach  country  to  make  water  use  more  efficient  and  productive,  and  improve  agricultural \nproductivity. These three countries were selected for this assistance because they (i) face water \nstress,1 (ii) have prioritized the water sector in their national development strategies, (iii) present \npotential windows for highlighting the water sector in their next Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry partnership strategies, and (iv) are likely candidates for water-related project financing \nfrom ADB once strategies have been developed and potential projects identified.2 The TA is \nconsistent with the ADB\u2019s water operational plan for 2011-2020, which includes preparations of \nwater  resources  sector  assessments  and  water  operational  plans  in  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs) during 2011\u20132013, and will contribute to the plan\u2019s output targets which \ninclude (i) sustainable ADB water lending of $2.0 billion\u2013$2.5 billion annually or a total of $20 \nbillion\u2013$25 billion by 2020, and (ii) the inclusion of increased water-use efficiency and/or water \nproductivity  as  an  output  in  all  ADB\u2019s  irrigation  projects  for  2012\u20132020. 3 The  TA  is  also \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  which  promotes  inclusive  economic  growth  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth and supports investments in rural infrastructure, including \nirrigation and water management.4 The water resources sector is one of four sectors in which \nADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) is committed to developing infrastructure. 5 \nThe governments of these three Central and West Asia DMCs have supported the concept of \nthe proposed policy and advisory TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Five of the ten DMCs in Central and West Asia suffer from water stress.7 Stress is \nhighest in Uzbekistan, where it has reached 118%. It is followed, in order of severity, by \nTurkmenistan (101%), Pakistan (80%), Tajikistan (75%), and the Kyrgyz Republic (44%).8 This \nwater  crisis  is  exemplified  by  the  continued  shrinking  of  the  Aral  Sea  in  Uzbekistan  and \nKazakhstan,  which  depends  on  water  the  flow  from  the  Amu  Darya  and  the  Syr  Darya. \nUnsustainable withdrawals of water have reduced flow in the Amu Darya and resulted in the \nnear-disappearance of a portion of the southern part of sea. This has led to deterioration of the \necosystem  and  in  the  economies  and  societies  that  depend  on  the  sea  and  downstream \n                                                \n1 The TA uses one of two definitions of water stress, which is the ratio of withdrawals to available resources. The \n2006 United Nations World Water Development Report (UNDP, 2006; World Bank and IMF, 2008) presents the \nRelative Water Stress Index, defined as the \u2015ratio of total water use to renewable water supply\u2016 (UNESCO, 2006). \nWater stress exists for ratios above 40%, while physical scarcity is reached for ratios above 75% (UNESCO, 2006).  \n2 ADB\u2019s  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan,  which  is  facing  serious  water  stress,  includes  the  water  sector. \nTurkmenistan, another water-stressed country, has no current national development strategy.  \n3  ADB. 2011. Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020. Manila (approved on 13 October). \n4 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n5 The  water  resources  sector  includes  (i)  integrated  water  resources  management,  including  climate  change \nadaptation  and  mitigation;  (ii)  irrigation,  drainage,  and  flood  protection;  (iii)  water-based  natural  resources \nmanagement; and (iv) irrigated land-based natural resources management (sustainable land management and \nconservation agriculture activity). Urban water and sanitation and rural drinking water supply are not covered by \nthis TA. Urban water and sanitation are expected to be covered under an ongoing regional TA: ADB. 2011. \nTechnical Assistance for the Preparation of Sector Road Maps for Central and West Asia. Manila. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 December 2011. \n7  Central Asia comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan. West Asia comprises Afghanistan and Pakistan.  \n8  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Aquastat Country Fact Sheets. http://www.fao.org/nr/ \nwater/aquastat/main/index.stm (accessed 13 September 2011). A withdrawal-to-water-supply rate of over 100% is \npossible because drainage return flows are reused.   \n ", "2   \nstretches  of  the  two  rivers.  In  addition,  frequent  water-related  disasters,  including  floods, \nmudflows, and droughts have impacted people and the economies in mountainous areas of the \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.  \n3.  Economic expansion, population growth, and unsustainable management of water use, \nespecially for irrigation, have been adding to the already great pressure on the water resources \nand the environment in water-stressed countries. A shift of industry from agriculture to non-\nagriculture sectors also demands better and more rational management of water resources.  \n4.  Climate change is also affecting the balance in hydrological cycles and the availability of \nwater resources. An example is the Pyanj River, which is a tributary of the Amu Darya, and has \nits river basin in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The outputs of ADB\u2019s previous TA for Tajikistan \npredicts in its river basin that (i) annual flow in some tributaries will increase until about 2080 \nand then decrease as glaciers start disappearing; (ii) annual river flows will become more \nvariable toward 2100 and high river flows will start earlier in some areas, as hydrological \nregimes are influenced more by rainfall-induced flows than by snow and ice melt; and (iii) \nannual evapotranspiration will increase in line with the predicted air temperature increase of \nabout 3.5\u00b0C between 2010 and 2100.9 These climate change risks will be manifested as (i) \nincreased demand for water, especially for irrigation, because of increasing temperatures and \nevapotranspiration,  potentially  leading  to  water  shortages,  and  (ii)  there  will  be  increasing \nsocioeconomic damage due to higher annual melt water floods in the glacier-fed rivers. These \npotential climate change impacts, as well as the pressure to increase agriculture production to \nsecure food supply, will make it more difficult to improve water management and may worsen \nwater stress.  \n5.  Several DMCs have neither strategies nor plans for prioritizing investments, and policy \nand institutional reforms in the water resources sector even though they are greatly needed to \nmeet the challenges of water-use efficiency, water productivity, and agricultural productivity. \nThis creates uncertainty about long-term government commitments to improvements in the \nwater resources sector and makes it difficult for development partners to (i) reach agreements \nwith  governments  on  strategic  directions,  (ii)  identify  these  governments\u2019  most  important \ninvestment and reform needs, and (iii) finance investments in the sector. The government \nprocesses for identifying qualified water resources sector investments are also weak. \n6.  With a water stress level at 44% in the Kyrgyz Republic, the country\u2019s medium-term \ndevelopment program for 2010\u20132014 makes irrigation one of eight priority sectors and requires \nan expenditure of $240 million to solve an irrigation water shortage in five southern districts. The \nprogram also requires (i) upgrading of the hydrometeorological data collection networks and (ii) \nrehabilitation of structures to protect populated areas and agricultural land from mudflows and \nfloods.  \n7.  The country development strategy for 2010\u20132014 in Tajikistan, which has a water stress \nlevel of 75%, calls for more efficient use of land and water, rebuilding and development of \nirrigation systems, and support for the formation of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs). The \nstrategy also emphasizes the need to reduce the land area affected by salinization and to \nensure a reasonable supply of irrigation water to promote environmental sustainability.  \n8.  The welfare implementation strategy for 2008\u20132010 in Uzbekistan, which suffers from \nthe highest water stress in Central and West Asia (118%), calls for (i) substantially increasing \n                                                \n9   ADB. 2010.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n9.  The impact will be increased investments in sustainable and efficient management of \nwater resources in the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.10 The TA outcome will be \nthe use of 5- to 10-year water resources sector strategies starting 2013 by the governments of \nthese  three countries for  water  resources management  planning to address  priority sector \nchallenges.   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n10.  The TA output will be the development of a water resources sector strategy for each \nDMC. For each country, the output will include (i) a sector assessment; (ii) the sector strategy; \n(iii) a list of priority investment projects, including the investments and associated policy and \ninstitutional  reforms  and  capacity  development  to  meet  challenges  that  include  water-use \nefficiency, water productivity, and the agricultural productivity of water; (iv) concept papers for \nthe priority investment projects selected from each country\u2019s list; and (v) a knowledge product \nsummarizing the process and outputs. The activities will be undertaken in two phases. \n11.  Phase  1  will  cover  (i) sector  assessments  to identify  and  prioritize  river  basin  and \nirrigation system challenges, (ii) development of sector strategies to propose solutions,  (iii) \nestablishing criteria for selecting potential investment projects, and (iv) finalizing the scope and \nimplementation arrangements of phase 2. Phase 1 will take 4 months, including 1 month in each \ncountry to assess the sector and develop a strategy. Phase 1 activities will be undertaken (i) \nfirst  in the  Kyrgyz  Republic;  (ii)  next  in  Uzbekistan;  and (iii)  last  in Tajikistan. The  sector \nstrategies will not be comprehensive and will instead address the top three challenges in each \ncountry.  These  will  be  identified  through  consultations  with  ministries,  donors,  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs); reviews of documents and data; and simplified field \nsurveys.11 Feedback from the government, donors, and NGOs will be discussed at a workshop \nwhen  finalizing  the  sector  assessment,  the  country  strategy,  and  the  criteria  for  selecting \npotential investment projects in each DMC.  \n12.  Phase 2 will develop a list of priority investment projects, concept papers for the priority \ninvestment projects, and a knowledge product in each country.12 Phase 2 will take 8 months, \nincluding 1.5 months in each country to develop the lists, with the remaining time allotted to \nobtaining government endorsements and to produce the knowledge product. The list of priority \n                                                \n10 Subject to available financing from ADB and/or the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility, the development of water resources sector strategies for other Central and West Asian countries will \nfollow.  \n11 Simplified field surveys will be required to verify the challenges identified through consultations and the reviews of \ndocuments and data.  \n12 The TA output is expected to include knowledge products summarizing the sector assessment findings, the \nstrategies, the lists of priority investments, and concept papers. \n ", "4   \nprojects  will  be  finalized  using  feedback  from  the  government,  donors,  and  NGOs  at  a \nworkshop.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing    \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, of which (i) $0.5 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund13 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility and \nadministered by ADB, and (ii) $1.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  with  CWRD\u2019s  Environment,  Natural \nResources, and Agriculture Division as the focal point. ADB\u2019s resident missions will support the \nTA  under  CWRD\u2019s  joint  venture  approach.  The  Environment,  Natural  Resources,  and \nAgriculture Division will also be responsible for overall TA management and coordination. In \neach country, the ministry in charge of water resources management will be the implementing \nagency and the ministry or ministries in charge of national strategy planning and finance will \nprovide  the  implementing  agency  with  strategic  guidance  and  support.  Each  participating \ngovernment will appoint two main focal points in the implementing agency (one for decision \nmaking and another for administrative support) and one focal point each in the other ministry or \nministries involved. The focal points are expected to review and endorse the key TA outputs.  \n15.  The TA will require six international consultants (25 person-months) and nine national \nconsultants (33 person-months). An international water management consultant will be team \nleader and the other international consultants will be responsible for (i) salinity management, (ii) \nirrigation management, (iii) agricultural development, (iv) image interpretation, and (v) economic \nevaluation. Phase 1 will require 10.5 person-months of international and 15.0 person-months of \nnational consultancy, while phase 2 will need 14.5 person-months and 18.0 person-months of \ninternational and national consultant services, respectively. A consultant firm will be recruited for \nthe two phases using a full technical proposal and weighted quality- and cost-based selection, \nwhich will apply a 90:10 ratio to reflect the additional challenges presented by differences and \ncomplexities of the water resources sectors in these three countries. ADB will also recruit one \nindividual international consultant for 13 person-months to liaise with the consultant firm and the \nimplementing agencies and to manage the delivery schedule and output quality. The consultant \nfirm and the individual consultant will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA fund will be disbursed in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n16.  The TA will be implemented from December 2011 to March 2013. The TA team will \noversee the outputs of the TA activities, including comments on draft papers and coordination of \nmissions to meet governments. The no-objection of each participating CWRD country will be \nconfirmed before TA activities are financed and begin in that DMC.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n13  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n ", "  5 \nIV.
