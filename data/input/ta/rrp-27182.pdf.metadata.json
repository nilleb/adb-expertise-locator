The  urban  centers  have  major  deficiencies  in\ninfrastructure and delivery of services in subsectors given\nhigh  priority  by  the  provincial  government  under  its\nProvincial Spatial Development Framework and Strategy\nand sector investment needs program. The Project also\naims  to  improve  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to\nprovide, operate, and maintain essential urban services in\nline with the Government's devolution program.\nClassification Primary:  Pro-poor growth\nSecondary: Human development\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B\nAn initial environmental examination was undertaken.\nRationale Urban centers in the NWFP are experiencing rapid growth\nand rising demand for improved urban services. Current\ndeficiencies  in  basic  infrastructure  are  inhibiting  human\ndevelopment  and  economic  growth,  and  severely\nconstraining the potential for urban areas to play a more\nsignificant role in economic growth of the province. The\nGovernment\u2019s proposed devolution policy will place new\ndemands on local governments to improve financial and\ninstitutional capacity and human resource management.\nNWFP's  Urban  Investment  Plan,  together  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  initiatives  and  greater\ndevolution of power and responsibility to local governments\nto provide and finance urban infrastructure and municipal\nservices,  all  require  support.  Participatory  approaches\nneed  to  be  developed  together  with  (i)  institutional\ndevelopment  and  devolution  of  service  delivery;  (ii)\ntargeting of low-income communities; (iii) financial equity\nand  cost  recovery  at  the  local  government  level;  (iv)\npartnerships between communities and local governments;\n(v) priority investments in basic services that will impact on\nthe  lives  of  low-income  groups;  and  (vi)  stimulation  of\ndemand-driven competition.\nObjectives and Scope The main aim of the Project is to support the (i) devolution\nof  responsibility  and  authority  to  local  governments  by\nexpediting  the  policy  reform  process  in  the  sector,  (ii)\ndecentralization  of  economic  growth  to  reduce\nprovincewide  disparities,  and  (iii)  reduction  of  urban\ninfrastructure deficiencies. The specific objectives are to (i)\ndemonstrate  effective  interventions  in  urban  service\nmanagement  that  can  be  replicated,  (ii)  stimulate  a", "iii\nprogressive  shift  of  responsibilities  to  urban  local\ngovernments  for  financing  and  management  of  urban\nservices,  and  (iii)  improve  management  and  resource\nmobilization capacities of urban local government.\nThe  Project  will  finance  high-priority  basic  infrastructure\ninvestment  in  accordance  with  the  needs  of  each\nparticipating municipal committee (MC), in the context of\ntheir  medium-term  investment  needs.  Infrastructure  will\nconsist  of  subprojects  in  water  supply,  sewerage  and\nsanitation, drainage, solid waste management, and roads\nand  local  access.  The  Project  will  consist  of  two\ncomponents:  (i)  urban  development,  including\ninfrastructure improvements and community development\nand  participation;  and  (ii)  institutional  development,\nincluding project implementation support, municipal finance\ncapacity building, and incremental administrative support.\nCost Estimates The Project cost is estimated at $30.0 million equivalent, of\nwhich $8.7 million equivalent is the foreign exchange cost\nand $21.3 million equivalent the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan                  ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Costs\nADB 8.5      12.3     20.8        69\nNWFP 0.2        7.2       7.4        25\nMCs 0.0        1.8       1.8          6\nTotal 8.7      21.3     30.0      100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, MC = Municipal Communities,  NWFP = North-\nWest Frontier Province.\nLoan Amount and Terms A loan of SDR 16,136,000 ($20.8 million equivalent) will be\nprovided in various currencies from the Asian Development\nBank's (ADB) Special Funds resources for a term of 32\nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nRelending Terms The  MCs  will  be  required  to  finance  the  incremental\nadministration costs associated with their investments in\nthe Project, and a minimum of 20 percent of the cost of\ncapital works of town-specific subproject costs, increasing\nto a maximum of 50 percent based on the MCs current and\nprojected  financial  capacity  at  the  time  of  subproject\napproval, through subloans using project funds. Tripartite\nsubsidiary project agreements, including grant and subloan\ncomponents,  will  be  entered  into  between  the  NWFP\nDepartment of Finance, Local Government, Elections and\nRural Development (LGERD), and the participating MCs.\nSubloans to the MCs will be at an interest rate of 7 percent\nper  annum,  with  a  grace  period  of  three  years  and\nrepayment  of  principal  over  12  years.  The  subsidiary", "iv\nproject  agreements  will  include  standard  terms  and\nconditions,  and  will  be  supported  by  a  loan  agreement\nbetween  the  NWFP  Department  of  Finance  and  the\nMinistry of Finance.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2008\nExecuting Agency  The Executing Agency for the Project will be the NWFP\ngovernment through LGERD.\nImplementation Arrangements A project steering committee to oversee the Project, and to\nbe chaired by secretary, LGERD, with committee members\nrepresenting  Department  of  Finance,  Planning  and\nDevelopment  Department,  Works  and  Services\nDepartment, and the departments handling the functions of\nthe  Physical  Planning  and  Housing  Department,  Public\nHealth  Engineering  Department  and  environmental\nconcerns, will meet at least twice a year and as often as\nrequired.  A  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  be\nestablished  in  LGERD,  and  will  (i)  prepare  the  overall\nproject implementation plan and the consolidated annual\nwork  plan,  (ii)  coordinate  and  appraise  subproject\nfeasibility  studies,  (iii)  provide  technical  support  and\nsupervision  functions  for  subproject  implementation,  (iv)\nplan and coordinate activities to improve local government\nfinancial  management,  (v)  plan  and  guide  community\nparticipation, (vi) provide advice on terms of reference and\nconsultant  selection  for  design  and  supervision  of\nsubprojects,  (vii)  facilitate  project  coordination,  (viii)\nprepare consolidated progress reports and documentation,\n(ix) organize benefit monitoring and evaluation activities,\nand (x) prepare the project completion report.  The PCU\nwill be headed by a project director from LGERD. The\nPCU\u2019s  agenda  of  activities  range  from  the  continual\nmonitoring of MC participation criteria to the screening and\ndevelopment of the physical investment program. The PCU\nwill provide technical support and supervisory functions for\nsubproject implementation, and have 12 professional staff,\nsupported by international and domestic consultants.\nProcurement Procurement  will  generally  be  carried  out  by  the  MCs\nunder the guidance of the PCU. All procurement will follow\nADB's  Guidelines for Procurement.  Since  most  of  the\nproject sites will be small and scattered, the Project will not\nlikely  attract  international  civil  works  contractors.  All\nsubprojects are expected to cost less than $1.0 million and\nwill  therefore  be  undertaken  through  local  competitive\nbidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.\nWhere  the  contract  value  exceeds  $1.0  million,  the\ncontract will be procured through international competitive\nbidding  procedures.  Equipment  items  that  are  locally\navailable and cost more than $50,000 equivalent and less\nthan $100,000 equivalent may be procured through local", "v\ncompetitive bidding, while items costing less than $50,000\nmay be procured through direct purchase in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB. International shopping\nwill  be  followed  for  materials  and  equipment  packages\nestimated  to  cost  more  than  $100,000  but  less  than\n$500,000  equivalent, while  for  materials  and  equipment\npackages  costing  in  excess  of  $500,000  equivalent,\ninternational  competitive  bidding  will  be  used.  All\nprocurement  will  be  channeled  through  the  PCU  for\nconcurrence before submission to ADB for approval.\nConsulting Services To support project implementation, a total of 396 person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services  (36  person-months\ninternational  and  360  person-months  domestic)  will  be\nrequired, covering (i) project management support to the\nPCU  and  project  implementation  teams,  including\nsubproject preparation and appraisal, and capacity building\nfor  subproject  implementation  by  local  government\nagencies (214 person-months); and (ii) capacity building\nfor municipal financial management to the MCs, to improve\naccounting  systems  and  increase  local  revenues  (182\nperson-months). Consultants will support LGERD and MC\nstaff. The consultants will be engaged through a firm under\na single contract, and in accordance with ADBs Guidelines\non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.  In  addition,  one  or  more  NWFP-based\nnongovernment  organizations,  to  be  recruited  by  a\ngovernment  committee,  in  accordance  with  established\nguidelines, will be involved in the process of establishing\nsustainable  government-community  partnerships,  for  the\ndevelopment  of  effective  and  lasting  channels  of\ncommunication.\nEstimated Project 31 December 2007\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and The Project will improve the living conditions of about\nBeneficiaries 400,000  residents  in  up  to  24  urban  centers,  by\nenhancing the quality of life and health, improving the\nenvironment,  and  creating  conditions  conducive  to\nsustained urban development and economic growth. The\nProject will contribute to reduced mortality, morbidity, and\npoverty,  and  the  loss  of  amenity  associated  with\nenvironmental  degradation  in  urban  centers,  especially\namong  slum  inhabitants  and  poor  groups,  particularly\nwomen and children, who are estimated to make up 15\npercent of the urban population.

PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) Urban\nDevelopment Sector Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The Government has recognized the need for greater responsibility and decision making\nby  lower  levels  of  government,  especially  within  urban  centers  where  high  growth  rates,\ncombined with the slow development of the urban sector are resulting in uncontrolled and\nunplanned  development.  Recently  the  Government  initiated  a  policy  of  devolution  of\nresponsibility for development to local governments and communities. The mobilization of local\nresources  and  improved  management  of  existing  urban  infrastructure  and  services  are\nparamount to achieving these objectives. To achieve this goal, the Government has requested\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in developing the economic potential of urban\ncenters in NWFP by improving existing infrastructure, and developing the required institutional\ncapacity of local governments. The Appraisal Mission1 was undertaken from 14\u201323 June 2000.\nThis report is based on the consultant\u2019s reports prepared during an ADB-financed technical\nassistance  (TA),2  and  the  Mission\u2019s  understandings  with  both  the  federal  and  provincial\ngovernments, and with senior town officials and community groups. The linkage between the\nproject objectives, inputs, and outputs are shown in the project framework in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Trends and Conditions\n3. Pakistan\u2019s population, estimated at 135 million in 1999, is growing at about 2.3 percent\nper annum. The urban population of about 47 million, estimated to be growing at 5 percent per\nannum, accounts for approximately 35 percent of the total. This high rate of urban growth is\nexpected to continue in the foreseeable future, in view of the country\u2019s relatively high birth rate,\nmigration from rural areas in search of employment, and industrial and commercial growth in\nurban centers. By 2020, the urban population is expected to almost triple to around 115 million,\naccounting for about 50 percent of the total population. The annual national per capita income is\nabout $483. The 1998 United Nation Development Programme human development index ranks\nPakistan 138th among 174 countries and classifies it as a medium human development country.\nHowever, this ranking is lower than Pakistan's rank in real gross domestic product per capita,\nindicating that more emphasis should be placed on human development. The infant mortality\nrate is about 85 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy is estimated at 63 years for men and\n62 years for women. Despite significant progress during relatively high economic growth in the\n1980s, poverty incidence remains high, with an estimated one quarter to one third of the\npopulation living below the poverty line.3\n                  \n1\nThe Mission comprised W. A. Costin, Sr. Urban Development Specialist and Mission Leader; V. S. Rekha,\nCounsel; and S. A. Khan, Sr. Project Implementation Officer, Pakistan Resident Mission. The Pakistan Resident\nMission provided guidance and support to the Mission.\n2\nTA 2940-PAK: North-West Frontier Province Urban Development Project, for $1.15 million, approved on 12\nDecember 1998.\n3\nPoverty is defined in terms of deprivation of a minimum bundle of the basic necessities of human life such as food,\nbased on a consumption of 2,550 calories per day, clothing, and nonfood requirements.", "2\n4. High urban growth, combined with slow development of the urban sector, has resulted in\nuncontrolled  and  unplanned  development  of  the  cities  and  towns,  deteriorating  urban\nenvironment, and deficiencies in all forms of urban services, including water supply, sewerage,\nroads, drainage, and solid waste management. Lack of urban planning, land-use control, and\nconstruction regulations, coupled with limited skilled human resources and financial capacities,\nin almost all urban centers, has constrained the ability of governments to meet the overall needs\nof urban communities. Many slums have emerged in urban centers. NWFP is no exception to\nthis phenomena. NWFP, with a total population of around 17 million, and an urban population of\napproximately 3 million, has an annual population growth rate of some 3.5 percent. In 1993/94\npoverty incidence was estimated to be approximately 17.7 percent, with poverty incidence in\nurban areas accounting for around 15 percent. By 2020, the urban population in NWFP is\nexpected to be 5.6 million. The current NWFP administrative boundary contains 7 divisions with\n24 districts and 46 classified urban centers; populations in each range from a few thousand to a\nmillion in the capital city of Peshawar. Appendix 2 provides a list of the urban centers, their\nadministration classification, population and growth rate, and per capita incomes as of 1998.\nApproximately half the towns in the province have populations ranging from 25,000 to 100,000.\nAverage household size is 7.7 persons, with an average of 1.2 families per household.\n5. Levels of urban services within NWFP urban centers can be generally characterized as\nlow, especially in comparison with many other South Asian countries. Coverage and service\nlevels vary greatly from town to town. While most of the towns have a water supply system,\ncoverage of households with access to water supply ranges from 25 to 83 percent of the\npopulation. Due to lack of maintenance and poor initial construction, water losses in existing\npiped systems are in excess of 40 percent. Service levels in the sanitation sector are low; only\nfour towns in the province have piped sewerage systems. However, a large percentage of\nhouseholds have individual sewage disposal systems, consisting mainly of pit latrines, and to a\nlesser extent, septic tanks. These systems are often in poor condition with overflows discharged\ninto open canals and drainage networks, and infiltrating the surrounding groundwater aquifers.\nDrainage systems in the towns are dependent on open canals serving as both drainage and\nsewage collection points. Secondary and tertiary drainage systems are virtually nonexistent.\nWhile limited solid waste collection systems exist in most of the towns, waste is commonly\ndisposed  of  in  open  fields  and  unsanitary  dump  sites.  While  urban  road  networks  are\nreasonably  extensive,  they  are  all  in  extremely  poor  condition  and  maintenance  is  totally\ninadequate. Municipal facilities such as public markets, bus shelters, slaughterhouses, and\ncommunity buildings are inadequate to meet the demands of the public. The existing standards\nand provision of urban infrastructure and services are generally insufficient to support sustained\nhuman development and economic growth in the urban centers.\n2.  Sector Institutions, Infrastructure, and Finance\na.  Urban Sector Institutions\n6. Responsibility  for  urban  development  and  environmental  management  is  distributed\namong various government organizations: local authorities, urban councils, cantonment boards,\nand departments handling public health engineering, communication and works. Details on the\nsector institutions are provided in Appendix 3. The NWFP Local Government Ordinance was\npromulgated  in  August  2001  and  as  many  of  the  functions  are  being  devolved  from  the\nprovincial to the local government level, a number of government organizations are being\nreorganized and renamed. As many as 24 federal, provincial, and local government agencies\nare involved in urban development in NWFP. As a result, some functions, such as undertaking\nurban development projects, are duplicated by several agencies, while many other functions,\nsuch  as  urban  planning,  land-use  control,  construction  regulation,  and  operation  and\nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  completed  urban  facilities,  are  left  without  adequate  attention.  The", "3\ninstitutional framework through which urban areas are administered and developed is complex.\nFundamental  shortcomings  are  the  separation  of  the  budgeting  role  from  the  urban\ndevelopment planning role, and the absence of a clear framework for urban land-use planning.\nAs a result, towns have no form of development control. In the absence of medium-term plans\nand budgets, the discontinuity created by perpetual political change prevents the realization of\nany urban development strategy.\n7. Two main ministerial departments are largely responsible for the provincial institutional\nframework. The Local Government, Elections, and Rural Development Department (LGERD) is\nresponsible for the administration of local councils. Originally exclusively responsible for local\ngovernment administration, LCB has become increasingly involved in supporting local councils\nfor  planning,  finance,  and  infrastructure  engineering.  The  Physical  Planning  and  Housing\nDepartment (PPHD) is the main department responsible for land-use planning, and guiding and\ncontrolling urban growth and development. The Provincial Urban Development Board within\nPPHD is a semiautonomous body, created to formulate policies on urban area development.\nPart  of  its  powers  are  delegated  to  local  area  authorities,  through  the  establishment  of\ndevelopment  authorities  in  the  main  urban  centres  (Dera  Ismail  Khan,  Hazara,  Kohat,\nMalakand, Mardan, and Peshawar). A separate project management unit headed by a director\ngeneral was established under the Provincial Urban Development Board to implement the ADB-\nsupported Second Urban Development Project (SUDP).4 The unit is also the counterpart agency\nfor other urban development initiatives, in particular for the Community Infrastructure Project, an\ninfrastructure  upgrading  project  being  implemented  in  55  rural  and  urban  low-income\ncommunities in NWFP and funded jointly by the World Bank, Swiss Agency for Development\nand Cooperation, and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).\n8. Central  to  all  planning  at  the  provincial  level  is  the  Planning  and  Development\nDepartment (PDD), headed by the additional chief secretary. It holds overall responsibility for\nplanning and development of all NWFP sectors, including policy and procedures, and plays a\nkey  role  by  coordinating  the  preparation  of  annual  budgets  of  the  Provincial  Annual\nDevelopment Programme. In this capacity, PDD reviews investment proposals for development\nfrom all line departments, and prepares recommendations to the NWFP government, as part of\nthe  plan  approval  procedure.  Most  issues  relevant  to  urban  infrastructure  fall  under  the\nresponsibility of the additional secretary holding the PPHD portfolio.\n9. Line departments are responsible for the delivery of major urban infrastructure projects.\nThe  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  is  mandated  to  plan  and  construct  water  and\nsewerage works in urban areas.  Once completed, water supply schemes are generally handed\nover  to  local  councils.  The  Communication  and  Works  Department  is  responsible  for  the\nconstruction, repair, and O&M of provincial roads (and associated roadside drains), bridges, and\ntunnels in the province. In many cases, to maintain sections of the national highway network,\nwork is contracted by the National Highway Authority. Urban (local) roads are the responsibility\nof local councils, although this may also be subcontracted to the Communication and Works\nDepartment for practical purposes.\n10. Urban local government5 in Pakistan is presently through local councils administered by\nLCB.  Local  councils  currently  include  the  Peshawar  Municipal  Corporation,  29  municipal\n                  \n4  Loan 1004-PAK: Second Urban Development, for $66.0 million, approved on 14 December 1989.\n5\nWhile the role and position of urban local government has changed due to the NWFP Local Government Ordinance\npromulgated in August 2001, with devolution of power to local governments, and the creation of district assemblies,\nthe change will be more in terms of political form and financial autonomy than in administrative powers and\nfunction; laws, rules, and regulations will be amended as required.", "4\ncommittees (MCs),6 and 16 town committees. All towns under the proposed Project are classed\nas MCs. The MCs are grouped in categories, depending on the level of revenue, irrespective of\nthe population size. LCB allocates staffing levels according to category, not to population size.\nThe MCs are given a range of mandated functions. In addition to the provision of basic urban\nservices  and  infrastructure,  responsibilities  include  drawing  up  master  plans  and  site\ndevelopment plans, and a form of building control. The MCs generally do not have adequate\nnumbers of skilled staff or local revenue. Typical staff in an MC, depending on its size and\ncovering  administrative,  financial,  and  engineering  units,  comprise  an  administrator,  chief\nofficer, various levels of clerks, accounts officer, accountant, tax officer, collectors, municipal\nengineer,  subengineer,  sanitary  inspector,  sanitary  supervisor,  and  a  number  of  sanitary\nworkers. Maintenance of urban infrastructure is given low priority. Urban populations have little\nconfidence in local government, and are reluctant to pay existing taxes and charges because of\npoor service delivery.\n11. Planning  legislation  for  local  councils  is  included  in  the  NWFP  Local  Government\nOrdinance (1979), which mandates the preparation of master plans. However, under the NWFP\nUrban Planning Ordinance (1978), the Provincial Urban Development Board, through its local\narea authorities, is delegated to prepare local area plans; this falls under a different provincial\ndepartment. Current legislation does not recognize the concept of structure plans as a means to\nprovide  a  medium-term  framework  for  urban  land-use  planning  that  is  immune  to  political\nchange.\n12. Elections for local councils were suspended in 1996, and towns are administered by an\nadministrator appointed by the secretary, LGERD. The administrator is presently supported by\nofficers heading four main departments. The main departments relevant to urban services and\ninfrastructure  are  the  (i)  Health  Department:  responsible  for  sanitation  (solid  waste\nmanagement, drainage, and vaccination); (ii) Water Supply Department: responsible for water\nsupply, fire fighting, and street watering; and (iii) Building and Works Department: responsible\nfor  roads,  general  municipal  works,  building  control,  gardens,  roadside  drains,  and  street\nlighting.\nb. Urban Infrastructure\n13. Core  areas  of  most  urban  towns  suffer  from  inadequate  infrastructure  and  poorly\nmanaged services. Town centers often lack adequate markets and other community facilities,\nand the number of low-income households living in slum and squatter settlements is steadily\nincreasing. To meet growing pressures and demands, urban development has usually occurred\nwith little or no effective environmental controls and with forms of urban governance that do not\nmatch  the  responsibilities.  Little  attention  has  been  given  to  the  environmental  and  social\nimplications  of  such  rapid  urban  expansion,  including  availability  of  water  resources,  job\nopportunities,  human  hygiene,  social  integration,  and  personal  security  and  safety  of  the\nresidents. Rapid urban expansion without effective governance means that in virtually every\nurban center a substantial proportion of the population is at risk from environmental, social, and\neconomic threats. A survey undertaken by the TA consultants indicates that water supply,\nsanitation, and solid waste are the major concerns of town communities; road improvement and\nstorm-water drainage are also highly ranked. While 37 percent of households have individual\nhouse connections to piped water systems, 2 percent rely on community standpipes, 37 percent\non wells, and 24 percent on other sources. Problems concerning water supply generally relate\nto  the  lack  of  distribution  systems  and  the  quality  and  intermittent  supply  of  water,  often\navailable less than six hours per day. The quality of drinking water is often low due to aging\n                  \n6 Municipal Committees means a participating Tehsil Municipal Administration set up under the NWFP Local\nGovernment Ordinance, 2001, including any successsor(s) thereof, functioning at the local government level of\nNWFP.", "5\ndistribution systems, lack of local treatment facilities, and contaminated water sources in some\nurban centers. Sanitation facilities are generally insufficient with 40 percent of residents either\nconnected  to  piped  sewerage  systems  or  dependent  on  individual  septic  tanks,  with  the\nremainder using pit latrines, bucket latrines, fields, or streams. Wastes from septic tanks and\nlatrines  are  disposed  of  in  drains  and  open  areas,  creating  unhygienic  conditions  and\ncontaminating the shallow water aquifers. The lack of treatment of wastewater and its direct\ndisposal  into  waterways  not  only  affects  groundwater  quality,  but  also  depletes  aquatic\nresources, and pollutes surrounding water bodies. Approximately 27 percent of solid waste is\nregularly collected by municipal authorities, with the waste being disposed of in open areas,\nwithout any proper treatment and protective measures. The remaining solid waste is disposed of\nby residents along roads and in open spaces and nearby water courses. No waste classification\nsystem exists, and hazardous waste is mixed with domestic waste. Town road networks are\ngenerally  adequate  but  their  condition,  width,  and  quality  of  maintenance  are  inadequate.\nDrainage problems are often associated with poor flow conditions due to inadequate drain sizes\nand  insufficient  coverage.  Stagnant  water  is  common,  causing  health  hazards  and\nenvironmental  degradation.  Details  of  the  existing  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  urban\ncenters is given in Appendix 4.\nc.  Finance\n14. The financial capacity of local government is at an early stage of development. The\naverage revenue of the MCs in NWFP in 1998/99 was, excluding Peshawar, PRs15 million\n($0.3 million), with revenue ranging from PRs4 million to PRs52 million. The octroi tax, which\nwas abolished in 1999, was the principal source of revenue, accounting for between 30 and 50\npercent of MC revenue. Net revenue obtained from the octroi tax, a local tax, has been replaced\nwith a grant from the federal Government using revenue from the general sales tax. While this\nchange  has  been  revenue  neutral  for  individual  local  governments,  it  has  resulted  in\nsubstantially different rates of federal Government grants to local governments, ranging from\nPRs30 to PRs260 per capita in a sample of towns. Hence, the level of the federal grant has\nconsiderable influence on MC financial resources. While the federal Government has no plans\nto reform the grant, the current unequal distribution may be corrected, so relatively greater\nassistance is provided to poorer localities. The grant could also be provided on a matching basis\nto  locally  derived  municipal  income  to  encourage  local  resource  mobilization.  Such\ndevelopments would have a significant impact on individual local government income.\n15. Water rates typically account for about 10 percent of municipal revenue. Cost recovery\nfor water supply is poor, with revenue being a little under half of O&M costs. Water tariffs are set\nby the NWFP government at a uniform rate for all towns, with the current monthly rate of PRs60\nper household set in 1995. Municipal collection efficiency for water charges is about 70 percent.\nThe NWFP Finance Department is currently proposing that the charge be increased to PRs85\nper household per month, which will restore most of the decline in the real value of the current\nrate that has occurred due to inflation.\n16. The  immovable  property  tax  is  administered  by  the  NWFP  Excise  and  Taxation\nDepartment with the local town governments receiving 85 percent of the revenue collected. The\ntax base was changed in 1997 to a scaled flat rate related to property land area; this should\nprovide a robust tax base. However, revenue from the tax falls far short of its potential. It\nprovides an average of about 5 percent of municipal income, but varies considerably with the\ncollection efficiency for individual towns ranging from almost zero to about 40 percent. Revenue\nfrom the combination of the grant from the federal Government, water sales, and the property\ntax account for over half of MC income, but is largely beyond their control. The MCs gain the\nremainder of their income from a range of sources; the most significant are a tax on transactions\nat cattle sales, charges for the use of bus terminals, and rent for municipal properties. Few local", "6\ngovernments impose charges for solid waste collection. Weak institutional capacity of the local\ngovernments and the low willingness by the general public to pay for services, which they have\ntraditionally  expected  the  Government  to  provide  free  of  charge,  has  limited  resource\nmobilization by local governments.\n17. A little over half of MC expenditures are for staff. O&M expenditure is limited, and capital\nexpenditure accounts for only 12 percent of total municipal expenditure. Total investment by the\nMCs and town committees in NWFP during 1996/97 to 1998/99 averaged PRs62 million per\nannum (in 1999 prices), equal to PRs22 per capita per year.\n18. Local governments need to increase the mobilization of finances if they are to undertake\nbasic  O&M  functions,  and  invest  in  infrastructure  and  human  resource  development.\nConsiderable  potential  exists  to  increase  local  government  revenue,  especially  from  the\nimmovable property tax and charges for water supply. However, increasing income from these\ntwo sources is largely dependent on the provincial government. The need for private sector\nparticipation in urban development is being increasingly recognized. Many towns in NWFP have\nstarted contracting out the collection of water tariffs and local taxes to private operators. The\nscope of private sector participation can be expanded, in part by withdrawing local government\nfrom commercial property activities.\n19. The finance function of local governments has traditionally had a relatively low profile,\nand  consequently  demand  has  been  low.  The  current  system  of  accounting  is  simple,  is\nundertaken almost exclusively using paper-based systems, and has the limited objective of\nsecuring  the  stewardship  of  cash.  The  taxation  and  financial  management  functions  are\nadministered through separate finance and taxation departments in each local government.\nManagement information and budgeting are undertaken at a basic level only. LGERD obtains\nconsiderable information on local government finance, but makes little use of it. A previous\nstudy7  proposed  that  a  more  comprehensive  accounting  system  based  on  double-entry\naccounting  principles  and  improved  budgeting  and  management  information  systems  be\nadopted. The proposal, which has not yet been implemented, remains appropriate. The NWFP\nFinance Department is currently reexamining the proposal, with a view to implementing it.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n1. Federal Programs and Strategies\n20. Although  progress  was  made  in  reducing  poverty  during  the  1970s  and  1980s,\napproximately 30 percent of the population still live in poverty and the incidence of poverty has\nbeen increasing over the past decade. The Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, established in\n1997 to finance income-generating projects, microenterprises, and infrastructure projects at the\ncommunity level, mainly through nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the private sector,\nhas recently commenced its lending activities. In April 1999, the Government released a draft\nfederal poverty strategy with the major objectives to (i) provide employment opportunities; (ii)\npromote sustainable economic growth; (iii) sustain growth using people friendly strategies that\npromote  labor  intensive  employment  and  provide  access  to  microfinance;  (iv)  expand  and\nimprove the quality of social services; (v) foster the development of community organizations to\ncreate social capital; (vi) focus on women as productive partners in development; (vii) mobilize\ngovernment support organizations, especially NGOs; (viii) create safety nets for the poor; and\n(ix) support the evolution of an integrated approach that will create synergy through existing\ninterventions.  While  strategy  implementation  is  presently  uncertain  due  to  the  indefinite\npostponement of the 1999 Pakistan Development Forum, where the policy was to be presented,\nthe  Government  recently  launched  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Program  with\n                  \n7 TA 1248-PAK: Urban Financial Management and Accounting, for $700,000, approved on 19 December 1989.", "7\nimplementation  commencing  in  March  2000.  The  program,  which  emphasizes  stimulating\nemployment opportunities and providing basic essential infrastructure and services to rural and\nlow income urban areas, is now ready to commence implementing projects based on approved\nselection criteria for poverty-related projects. The type of projects that can be considered are\nidentified  under  various  subsectors,  with  those  relating  to  low-income  urban  communities\nconsisting  of  water  supply  systems,  sewerage  and  solid  waste  management,  drainage,\nprovision of civic facilities, and maintenance of existing infrastructure. Each individual project will\ngenerally not exceed a cost of $100,000 equivalent, and importance will be given to involving\nvarious  communities  and  associated  organizations  in  project  selection,  planning,  and\nimplementation. A first tranche of PRs600 million (approximately $12 million) was released to\nNWFP, and the selection and approval of nominated projects is ongoing. The distribution of\nfunds will be based on 40 percent for farm to market roads, 10 percent each for water supply\nschemes and sanitation projects, 10 percent for projects specifically involving women, and 30\npercent for other eligible sectors. In each district, 25 percent of the projects will be selected in\nmarginalized areas.\n21. To  address  the  present  institutional  shortcomings,  particularly  the  delivery  of  basic\nservices and facilities to the general public, the Government recently announced a program to\ndevolve power and responsibility based on a bottom-up methodology, that is people-centered\nand customer service-oriented. The devolution program, contained in the Local Government\nOrdinance and promulgated in August 2001, is having significant impacts on the present system\nof local government, both administratively and financially. The local government design is based\non five fundamentals: devolution of political power, decentralization of administrative authority,\ndeconcentration  of  management  functions,  diffusion  of  the  power-authority  nexus,  and\ndistribution of resources to the district level. The present civil service is being transformed from\nrulers to service providers, while bringing about greater levels of accountability. Women are\nassured one-third representation on all union councils. The current fiscal transfer system from\nthe federal to the provincial government is not subject to political approval, is not based on a\ntransparent formula, is highly discretionary, and does not involve the district governments.\nUnder the new Local Government Ordinance, more transparent, predictable, and equitable\nformulas are being established to determine fiscal transfers and grants from the province to the\ndistrict level. At the same time, district and local governments will be encouraged to generate\ngreater financial resources from their own constituencies, and to be less dependent on grants\nfrom federal and provincial governments. At this initial stage, the district administrations have\nbeen  established  within  existing  line  departments,  however,  this  administration  system  is\nenvisaged to gradually move to a more corporate form of governance driven by a greater\nentrepreneurial approach. This will involve introducing a customer-service orientation, results-\nbased management using achievement indicators, and staff performance evaluations based on\nmonitoring  by  committees.  In  the  long  term,  service  contracts  will  be  introduced  that  are\nrenewable on the basis of performance and visible results in the improvement of the quality of\nlife of the general public.\n22. In response to the World Conservation Strategy launched in 1980, in 1992 the federal\nGovernment approved the National Conservation Strategy. Based on this strategy, in 1996 the\nNWFP cabinet approved the Sarhad Provincial Conservation Strategy. The strategy, developed\nusing  extensive  public  consultations,  sectoral  meetings,  and  thematic  workshops,  reflects\nprovincial aspirations for sustainable development and a commitment package containing major\npolicy statements, law reform initiatives, structural improvements, and new programs to achieve\nthe  strategy  objectives.  The  specific  objectives  are  to  (i)  address  the  fundamental  social\nproblems that are the underlying cause of environmental degradation; (ii) conserve, rehabilitate,\nand undertake sustainable development of natural resources; (iii) protect the living environment;\n(iv) develop high-quality environmental protection mechanisms including appropriate legislation,\ndevelopment  planning  mechanisms,  environmental  quality  standards,  and  participatory  and", "8\nregulatory institutional arrangements; (v) improve the institutional and financial capacity of the\nNWFP government to achieve sustainable development; (vi) protect and conserve the cultural\nheritage; (vii) increase community participation in environmental management; and (viii) raise\npublic  awareness  and  understanding  of  conservation  and  sustainable  development.  The\nstrategy defines priority areas for action, including (i) governance and capacity development; (ii)\npoverty  reduction  and  population;  (iii)  NGO,  communication  and  education;  (iv)  urban\nenvironment and sustainable cities; (v) sustainable industrial development; (vi) natural resource\nmanagement and biological diversity; and (vii) cultural heritage and sustainable tourism.  While\nimplementation of some of these initiatives has commenced, the full realization of the objectives\nmust  be  viewed  over  the  long  term.  The  strategy  provides  a  sound  basis  for  sustainable\ndevelopment in NWFP.\n23. The Eighth Five-year Plan (1993/94-1997/98) identified poor quality management as one\nof  the  major  problems  of  the  social  sector,  and  recommended  enhancing  the  absorptive\ncapacity of the system through effective institutional reforms. The plan called for deliberate\nfocus  on  the  empowerment  of  communities  and  NGOs;  and  identified  poverty  reduction,\npromotion  of  good  governance,  and  environmental  protection  as  its  major  development\nobjectives.  With  limited  achievements  under  the  plan,  and  in  recognizing  the  need  for\ninstitutional reform and improved governance at the provincial and local governments, the\nNWFP government, approved on 4 September 1999 the Action Plan for Restructuring and\nStrengthening Local Government. In general, the thrust of reforms is from the bottom-up. The\nemphasis on improving the capacity of local urban councils and municipalities is intended to\npercolate up through the system and influence the role and responsibilities of the provincial\ngovernment. The plan identifies the need for changes in organizational culture. Recognizing the\nunacceptable state of urban services within towns, and with the objective of establishing an\nenvironment in which the delivery of public services can be improved and sustained, the NWFP\ngovernment recently established an interdepartmental working group to assess the problems\nand to develop recommendations for institutional reforms. In line with the recent Government\ninitiative to undertake greater devolution and decentralization of responsibilities to the local\ngovernments,  part  of  the  NWFP  government\u2019s  overall  restructuring  plan  is  to  improve\ngovernance,  including  restructuring  civil  administration,  consolidating  existing  administrative\narrangements, identifying surplus staff of public service entities, enhancing tax collection, and\nincreasing  decentralization  and  devolution  of  administrative  and  financial  authority  and\nresponsibility to the provincial, district, and local levels. Cost recovery will be a main policy and\nstrategy  item,  and  incremental  user  tariffs  will  need  to  be  enforced  to  meet  the  entire\nexpenditure for effective O&M of completed projects.\n2. NWFP Urban Sector Framework and Investment Needs\na. Sector Framework\n24. NWFP  developed  the  Provincial  Spatial  Development  Framework  and  Strategy  for\n2000/01-2019/20, with a provincial five-year plan (2000/01-2004/05). Details of the framework\nare given in Appendix 5. The objectives of the framework and strategy identify a number of\npolicy issues and service standards that form the overall guiding parameters for future NWFP\nurban development initiatives. Under governance, the devolution of powers and responsibilities\nfor planning, implementation, and management of urban development to local government units\nis the overall objective. This will be supported by strengthening local governments to enhance\ntheir capacity to carry out the devolved powers. With the absence of any real development\nplanning tools, the development and implementation of urban structure plans will be undertaken\nto guide and control land use, and provide a basis for development and building control. To\nensure  enforcement  of  the  plans,  and  to  provide  the  necessary  legal  basis  for  their\nimplementation,  the  structure  plan  will  be  codified  within  the  legislative  framework.  The", "9\napplication of appropriate, affordable (least cost), and balanced service standards will be the\nguiding principle when planning and delivering urban services. These standards will be applied\nin  the  process  of  investment  planning,  prioritizing,  and  budgeting  for  the  development  of\ninfrastructure facilities. To ensure sustainability of urban infrastructure facilities, and to meet the\npriorities and aspirations of the urban communities, the focus will be on participatory planning\ntechniques involving community-based organization (CBOs). The sector strategy will emphasize\nreducing existing environmental degradation in urban towns using a combination of physical\ninfrastructure interventions, improved planning, community awareness programs, and enhanced\nO&M programs. Strengthening the capacity of local governments to raise local revenues, to\ncover at least the full cost of O&M of services, will be fundamental to any urban investment\nprograms.\n25. Urban  centers  in  NWFP  vary  widely  in  the  quality  and  coverage  of  basic  urban\ninfrastructure and services. The government has formulated targets for the provision of these\nbasic needs, as a guide for planning and prioritizing investments in the urban centers. Given the\nwide  disparities  in  infrastructure  provision,  a  range  of  target  standards  has  been  defined,\nmarked by low and high levels of service, with these targets to be reached by 2010. In addition,\nperformance indicators were defined, as a basis for monitoring and evaluating project success.\n26. In the project towns, from 25 to 83 percent of urban household currently have a piped\nwater supply. Quality varies greatly with availability as low as 1-3 hours per day. Reducing the\nincidence of unaccounted for water and illegal connection is a focus of the strategy. The low\ntarget for 2010 is to achieve 50 percent coverage of the urban population, while the high target\nis 75 percent. Performance indicators include reaching the low target for 2010: installing water\nmeters  in  50  percent  of  households,  improving  the  quality  of  service  by  adopting  key\nperformance indicators (water quality, pressure, hours of service), reducing unaccounted for\nwater losses, and increased available revenue to be spent on O&M.\n27. None of the proposed project towns have piped sewerage. Although many towns have\nexpressed interest in full piped sewerage schemes with sewage treatment, such schemes are\nnot considered realistic at the current levels of municipal income and available skills.  Targets\naim to improve the coverage of proper septic tanks (high: 75 percent, low: 40 percent), and\nimprove septic tanks maintenance by introducing a septic tank maintenance service. Whether\nthis service will be operated by the MC or contracted out to a private operator will depend on the\nMC's capacity. Performance indicators specify achieving the 2010 low target: the existence of a\nfunctioning septic tank cleaning service, and evidence of the installation of a septic tank for new\nbuildings.\n28. The central problem of the degraded living environment in all towns is related to the\ncondition of the secondary and tertiary drainage systems, which invariably carry fecal waste.\nTargets  for  drainage  improvement  are  difficult  to  express  in  quantitative  terms.  Rather,\nimprovements are aimed at routine cleaning and rehabilitation of the existing systems, including\nthe construction of road culverts. Performance indicators are formulated as an increase of real\nrevenue spent on drainage system maintenance.\n29. Coverage of domestic and commercial solid waste collection in the project towns ranges\nfrom 16 to 38 percent. These figures do not indicate the adequacy of the waste disposal\nmethods. Targets are formulated as a percentage of population served (low: 40 percent, high:\n60 percent) and as a fraction of the market waste collected (low: 80 percent, high: 90 percent).\nPerformance indicators define that solid waste disposal should be operated by the private\nsector, with the use of formal disposal sites by 2005, and achievement of the low coverage\ntargets by 2010.", "10\n30. Road maintenance in urban areas has been inadequate for many years. The MCs are\nresponsible for most roads and associated roadside drains within their urban areas, with the\nexception of provincial and national roads. The existing road conditions are quantified in terms\nof the investment (PRs per capita) required to reach a predefined high and low standard. Values\nrange from PRs400/capita to PRs2,000/capita to reach a low standard, and PRs1,300/capita to\nPRs5,000/capita to reach a high standard of road pavement. Targets are expressed as a\npercentage of roads in urban areas paved (low: 50 percent, high: 90 percent). Performance\nindicators  specify  achieving  the  2010  low  target:  increased  real  revenue  spent  on  road\nmaintenance, as well as traffic management issues addressed in local plans.\nb. Sector Investment Needs\n31. Sector investment needs are based on actions needed to redress seriously deteriorated\ninfrastructure and to expand infrastructure to service expected population growth. The urban\npopulation is expected to increase from 3.0 million in 1998 to 3.8 million in 2005, with average\npopulation growth of 3.4 percent per annum. An investment of about PRs4.8 billion (in 1999\nprices)  is  needed  in  NWFP  during  2000/01-2004/5  for  remedial  work  on  existing  urban\ninfrastructure. A further PRs13.8 billion is needed to provide the desired level of service to the\nincreased urban population by 2004/05. Total needed investment until 2004/05 is therefore\nPRs18.6 billion, equal to an average of PRs3.1 billion per year (PRs835 per capita per year). If\nrecent  average  annual  investment  in  urban  infrastructure  by  the  local  and  provincial\ngovernments of about PRs0.4 billion continues, the financing gap will be PRs2.7 billion per year\nif future targets are to be achieved. This represents an ambitious capital investment program\nthat will be difficult to implement in its entirety. Accordingly, desired investment projects will\nneed to be prioritized to ensure that the maximum benefit is obtained from the available finance;\nand an acceptance that the desired targets will be difficult to achieve. Details of the sector\ninvestment needs are shown in Appendix 6.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n32. ADB has been involved in the urban sector in NWFP since 1989 with one loan ($66.0\nmillion) and three TAs ($2.2 million). The loan,8 the SUDP, which was closed on 31 December\n1999, included road construction, sewerage treatment plants, water supply, drainage, slum\nupgrading,  and  solid  waste  management  in  seven  provincial  towns.  The  TAs  provided\nassistance with urban finance and management, and feasibility studies for priority investment\ncomponents in selected towns, with policy recommendations for institutional restructuring and\nfinancial management. Another major external assistance to the urban sector in NWFP is the\nCommunity Infrastructure Project, for the provision of infrastructure upgrading for 55 rural and\nurban low-income communities. The project commenced in 1994, and was financed by the\nWorld  Bank,  the  United  Nation\u2019s  Children  Fund,  and  Swiss  Agency  for  Development\nCooperation. Details on external assistance to the urban sector in Pakistan is given in Appendix\n7.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n33. Portfolio performance has been constrained by a number of generic macro and micro\nissues,  including  (i)  legal  and  administrative  issues  relating  to  processing  procedures  and\nrequirements,  (ii)  coordination  difficulties  and  procedural  issues,  (iii)  technical  and  project\nmanagement issues, and (iv) counterpart funding constraints and timely release. These issues\nresult in implementation delays, with often negative financial and economic consequences. In\naddition,  noncompliance  with  specific  covenants,  delay  in  consultant  recruitment,  minimal\nbeneficiary participation, poor O&M of completed facilities, low financial and economic rates of\n                  \n8   Loan 1004-PAK(SF), Second Urban Development Project, for $66.0 million, approved on 19 December 1989.", "11\nreturn, and frequent changing of senior project management staff diminishes accountability and\ntransparency, and undermines project sustainability.\n34. An important lesson derived from the Karachi Urban Development Project9 is that urban\nupgrading is complex, and a piecemeal approach involving a few selected problems is not an\noptimal solution. Urban upgrading should be designed from a plan that integrates all aspects of\nurban infrastructure, and involves the participation of the ultimate beneficiaries. The institutional\ncapacity to implement the project must be present, and the financial framework must be in place\nto ensure long-term sustainability of the upgrading. ADB\u2019s project performance audit report\nconcluded  that  the  Karachi  Urban  Development  Project  was  unsuccessful,  with  the  main\nidentified weakness being in the design. Appendix 8 provides details of lessons learned from\nprevious projects in the sector.\n35. The design of the proposed Project takes this experience into account, in particular to (i)\nimplement subprojects at the local level to develop greater ownership; (ii) use a competitive\nenvironment  to  select  participating  towns  and  subprojects;  (iii)  support  subproject\nimplementation and sustainability by obtaining financial contributions from participating towns,\nand enhancing the collection of taxes and fees from project beneficiaries; and (iv) develop a\nmonitoring system to ensure effective implementation and accrual of benefits to the target\ngroups.\nE. ADB's Sector Strategy\n36. ADB's operational strategy for Pakistan supports human resource development and\nsocial infrastructure requirements, as well as programs to respond to the policy environment,\nincluding  increased  priority  for  macroeconomic  management  and  support  for  economic\nstabilization and restructuring. With ADB\u2019s emphasis on poverty reduction, and the challenge to\ndeliver basic services to the people, resources must be effectively used, especially to reduce\npoverty in an environment of effective economic management, good governance, and strong\npolicy  commitment.  The  main  focus  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  urban  sector  will  be  on\nenvironmental  aspects  and  the  needs  of  the  poor,  and  will  broadly  cover  (i)  institutional\nrestructuring emphasizing eliminating overlapping functional responsibilities, professionalizing\nurban management, developing staffing policies, and devolving service delivery; (ii) private\nsector involvement in the delivery of selected urban services; (iii) budgeting and finance, and\nincreased cost recovery and municipal revenue; and (iv) increased community participation.\nCapacity  building  efforts  will  be  pursued  for  institutional  strengthening  of  provincial  and\nmunicipal  urban  management  and  operations,  including  planning  and  implementation\ncapabilities,  financial  management,  and  environment  management.  Identified  strategic\nconsiderations for the urban sector include (i) establishing service levels, affordability, and\nbeneficiaries' willingness to pay; (ii) implementing cost recovery; (iii) minimizing environmental\nimpacts;  (iv)  targeting  low-income  groups;  (v)  integrating  health  service  provision;  and  (vi)\nsupporting community participation.\n37. The  demand-oriented  planning  approach  is  considered  best  practice,  and  requires\ninvolving  beneficiaries  in  design,  technology  choice,  implementation,  and  operations;  and\nallowing  flexibility  in  project  design  and  service  levels.  This  project  participatory  design\nmethodology is central to ADB's sector development strategy. While in urban areas sector\ninterventions  are  tied  to  measures  to  conserve  environmental  resources,  public  sector\nmanagement capacity and accountability remain major constraints to satisfactory social sector\ndevelopment.  Improving  existing  service  delivery  mechanisms  is  essential  to  achieving\nsustainability and will be used to encourage private sector participation and NGO involvement.\n                  \n9 Loan 793-PAK(SF): Karachi Urban Development, for $55.20 million, approved on 14 October 1986.", "12\nPublic sector management requires decentralizing decision-making authority, policy reforms for\nlocal revenue generation capacity, and cost recovery for urban services.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n38. Since commencement of its assistance to the urban sector in the mid-1980s, ADB has\ncontinuously discussed issues and policies in the sector with the Government, particularly (i)\nimproving governance; (ii) enhancing service delivery; (iii) ensuring financial and administrative\nautonomy for urban service providers; (iv) implementing cost recovery and sound financial\nmanagement; (v) institutionalizing community participation; and (vi) providing greater equity in\nthe delivery of municipal services, particularly for the low income and disadvantaged groups\nwithin the community. ADB has noted with concern the lack of progress made in the NWFP\nurban  sector  to  strengthen  the  planning,  management,  and  financing  capacity  of  local\ngovernments. The Urban Sector Policy Action Plan outlines a clear set of objectives and tasks\nfor NFWP over the next five years to improve governance, financial strengthening, and resource\nmobilization, O&M, rehabilitation capability, and environmental protection. These objectives fully\ncomplement the Government\u2019s devolution initiatives.\n39. In view of the current limited capacity of local government for forward planning and\nraising financial resources, ADB's investment in the sector will be (i) strictly limited to high-\npriority basic needs of the urban poor, (ii) linked with capacity building programs for urban\nfinancial management and urban development planning, and (iii) simultaneous with programs\naimed to strengthen the municipal capacity for community participation. ADB recognizes the\noverriding importance of continuous training and education, taking into account the basic levels\nof skills and awareness in small urban communities in NWFP. The federal Government has\ndeveloped new initiatives to devolve power and responsibility to local governments, and reduce\npoverty.  Given  this  background,  the  urban  policy  for  NWFP  is  formulated  to  support  the\nGovernment\u2019s devolution and poverty reduction initiatives.\n1. Decentralization and Devolution\n40. The Government\u2019s policy of decentralization and devolution is critical to developing a\ngreater local responsibility. Unless greater accountability at the local level can be developed and\nmanagement  improved,  efficient  and  cost-effective  services  to  the  community  cannot  be\nachieved.  The  mobilization  of  local  resources  and  improved  management  of  existing\ninfrastructure and services are paramount to achieving these objectives.\n41. The federal Government has agreed that the Project will support these objectives by (i)\nstrengthening the managerial, financial, and technical capacity of the MCs by giving them more\nresponsibility, and upgrading the capability and capacity of their staff; (ii) providing adequate\nstaff,  equipment,  and  procedures  to  enable  the  MCs  to  increase  resource  mobilization,\nsuccessfully implement and sustain subprojects, and improve the management and delivery of\nexisting urban infrastructure and services; and (iii) providing a training program for the MCs and\nprovincial staff to develop their technical proficiency. The Government has made a commitment\nto aim at greater continuity in the appointment of key professional and administrative staff in\nlocal councils.\n2. The Urban Poor\n42. The  Government  is  committed  to  providing  support  for  low-income  groups,  and\nresponding to their needs in prioritizing development programs and evaluating the performance\nof urban services that will affect them. ADB has encouraged the urban poor to participate in\nthese processes to ensure the effective implementation of projects that meet user needs, and to\nenhance equity and sustainability in urban service provision. ADB has also encouraged the", "13\nGovernment to ensure that the benefits of activities intended to support the poor are delivered to\ntarget beneficiaries. The Project, through it\u2019s basic human needs approach, with emphasis on\nproviding improved services to lower income groups within the urban community, is designed to\nsupport these objectives.\n3. Urban Planning and Development Control\n43. ADB recognizes that the absence of a clear legal and institutional framework for urban\nland-use  planning  and  development  control  is  a  crucial  deficiency  when  improving  urban\nmanagement. The concept of structure plans as a guide for medium-term planning is (i) not\npresent in current legislation, and (ii) little known as a professional planning tool for urban sector\nstaff. Revision of the legislative and institutional framework to allow for an improved basis of\nplanning will require broad discussion and agreement at federal and provincial levels, and can\ntherefore not be achieved in the short term. ADB will therefore continue to support government\nin its aims to make practical improvement at the local level, by introducing the concepts of urban\nplanning to urban government staff as part of its capacity building program. Simultaneously,\nADB will continue its involvement in the longer-term review of the legislative and institutional\nframework of NWFP's urban sector. Under the Project, each participating town will be required\nto have an up-to-date base map, with the outline of an urban structure plan as a guide for future\ndevelopment. The Project will provide support for the development of structure plans that will\nultimately form the basis for improved municipal management and enhanced implementation of\nthe immovable property tax system.\n4. Communication between Local Government and Communities\n44. Both ADB and the Government recognize the current reluctance of the urban population\nto contribute to urban services through taxes or charges, largely because they lack confidence\nin local government to deliver any form of services to the benefit of the population. The drive to\nraising more local revenues by collecting taxes and charges can only succeed if government is\nseen to improve the quality of its services.  This will require improved communication between\ncivic society and local government, as well as an improved understanding by local government\nstaff  on  their  responsibility  to  provide  service  to  the  urban  population.  The  Project  will\nemphasize developing forms and mechanisms for community participation that are appropriate\nto  the  sociocultural  and  political  environment  of  urban  communities.  The  development  of\nsustainable  partnerships  between  community  groups  and  local  government  will  be  a  key\nobjective of the Project to develop effective and lasting channels of communication.\n5. Municipal Capacity for Community Participation\n45. ADB  is  committed  to  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  participatory\nplanning in urban management and development. To achieve this in government structures with\nlittle direct exposure to such techniques, ADB recognizes the need to understand the problems\nthat local government will experience in planning and implementing participatory processes, the\noptions for resolution, and the nature and extent of capacity building required. In program\npreparation, three primary areas will be identified where a better understanding as well as\nimmediate  action  is  required:  (i)  the  nature  of  participation  and  partnerships  with  poor\ncommunities,  (ii)  the  mechanisms  for  establishing  community  participation,  and  (iii)  the\ninstitutional change necessary to integrate participatory processes with current operations.", "14\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n46. Urban areas in NWFP are experiencing rapid growth, and demand for improved urban\nservice is increasing. Current deficiencies in basic infrastructure are inhibiting economic growth,\nand  severely  constraining  the  potential  for  urban  areas  to  play  a  more  significant  role  in\nNWFP\u2019S economic growth. To meet the growing pressures and demands, urban development\nhas usually occurred with little or no environmental controls and with forms of governance that\ncannot begin to meet the responsibilities. High urban growth combined with slow urban sector\ndevelopment has resulted in uncontrolled urban sprawl; deteriorating urban environments; and\ndeficiencies in all forms of urban services, including water supply, sewerage systems, drainage,\nsolid waste management, roads, and community facilities. Lack of urban planning, land-use\ncontrol, and construction regulations in almost all urban centers in NWFP has resulted in\nunplanned, ad hoc town developments, with the emergence of many slum areas.\n47. Although on average 39 percent of NFWP\u2019S urban population have access to piped\nwater supply, the quality of drinking water is often low due to the aging distribution system, lack\nof local treatment facilities, and contaminated water sources in some urban centers. System\nlosses are high and supply irregular, often providing for less than six hours per day. Sewerage\nsystems and drainage networks are totally insufficient in most towns, particularly in the low-\nincome  settlements,  where  localized  flooding  causes  unhygienic  conditions  and  seriously\nimpacts on the living conditions of the residents. In most urban towns, clinical, industrial, and\ncommercial sewage is discharged into open drains and canals without treatment. Wastewater\nfrom leaking sewers, unlined drainage canals, septic tanks, and open ponds percolates into the\nsoil and contaminates the shallow water aquifers from which most people draw their drinking\nwater.  Solid  waste  management  in  the  majority  of  urban  towns  is  at  best  rudimentary.\nApproximately 50 percent of the total generated solid waste is collected and the remainder is left\nuncollected and disposed of in waterways and open fields. This results in blocked drainage\nsystems, flooding, and environmental pollution.\n48. Of the 46 classified urban centers in NWFP, 7 towns participated in the SUDP leaving a\nremainder  of  39  urban  centers  to  be  considered  for  the  proposed  Project.  Towns  will  be\nselected for inclusion in the Project based on a series of assessments of key factors that include\n(i) administrative status (headquarters of either a division, district, or tehsil), (ii) availability of a\nbase map of the town, (iii) population size greater than 20,000 persons, (iv) population growth\nrate, (v) level and availability of social infrastructure, (vi) capability and interest of the local\ngovernment, and (vii) economic potential. Of the 24 urban centers meeting the criteria for\nadministrative status and population size, seven towns that meet all the criteria were selected\nas first-phase towns under the Project.\n49. The Project is formulated as a sector loan based on the NWFP government\u2019s overall\nlong-term sector requirements for 2001-2020. It will support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction\ninitiatives,  as  well  as  the  forthcoming  devolution  of  power  and  responsibility  to  the  local\ngovernments for the provision and financing of urban infrastructure and municipal services. The\nProject incorporates several strategic features and incentives for participation in the Project\nincluding (i) promotion of policy reform in the sector, particularly financial management and\nresource generation at the local government level; (ii) priority to investments that meet the basic\nneeds of urban communities; (iii) local community participation and ownership; and (iv) equity\nparticipation by local governments in the investment packages.\n50. The Project meets the criteria for adopting a sector lending modality. A workable urban\nsector framework and strategy exists, and LGERD has the legal mandate for administration of", "15\nthe  local  governments,  for  planning,  finance,  and  infrastructure  development.  In  addition,\nLGERD has the lead responsibility for implementing the Government\u2019s devolution and poverty\nreduction programs. The Project will also support ADB's urban sector strategic objectives,\nespecially for use of participatory approaches, institutional development, devolution of service\ndelivery,  targeting  of  low-income  communities,  financial  equity,  and  cost  recovery.  The\nGovernment  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  criteria  for  town  participation,  selection  of\nsubprojects, and appraisal standards.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n51. The overall objectives of the Project are to support the  (i) devolution of responsibility\nand authority to local governments by expediting the policy reform process in the sector; (ii)\ndecentralization of economic growth to reduce provincewide disparities; and (iii) reduction of\nurban infrastructure deficiencies in urban areas. The Project\u2019s specific objectives are to (i)\ndemonstrate effective interventions in urban services management that can be replicated, (ii)\nstimulate a progressive shift of responsibilities to urban local governments for financing and\nmanagement  of  urban  services,  and  (iii)  improve  management  and  resource  mobilization\ncapacities of urban local governments.\n52. The Project covers up to 24 urban centers in NWFP, classified as MCs (excluding 7\nurban  centers,  including  Peshawar,  included  under  the  SUDP),  with  a  total  population  of\napproximately 1.0 million, or around 32 percent of the overall provincial urban population. The\nProject gives priority to seven of these centers, which are generally representative of the urban\nsector, including Charsadda, Hangu, Haripur, Mansehra, Takht Bhai, Timargara, and Swabi,\nwith a total project population of around 400,000. Each of the seven centers has an outlined\nstructure  plan,  five-year  investment  plan,  urban  profile,  and  detailed  feasibility  studies  of\nproposed subprojects.\n53. The Project has two main components: (i) urban development, including infrastructure\nimprovements and community development and participation; and (ii) institutional development,\nincluding project implementation support, municipal finance capacity building, and incremental\nadministrative support. A description of these components follows and summary of the prepared\nsubprojects is given in Appendix 9.\n1. Urban Development Component\n54. The  urban  development  component  comprises  infrastructure  improvements  and\ncommunity development and participation, and includes town-specific investments in one or\nmore  infrastructure  improvement  subprojects,  and  formation  of  CBOs.  The  component  will\ncomplement the Government's initiatives under its Poverty Alleviation Program.\na. Infrastructure Improvements\n55. Water Supply. Subprojects will be designed to improve the service quality of existing\nschemes, and increase revenues through a combination of leak-detection programs and the\nconversion of illegal connections to registered accounts. Where necessary, distribution systems\nwill be extended to, or improved for, poorly served areas. Priority will be given to servicing low-\nincome areas. Consideration will be given to installing water meters in towns that have achieved\na secure 24-hour supply system, and that can demonstrate the technical and management\ndiscipline required to run a meter-based billing system.\n56. Sewerage and Sanitation. Subprojects will aim to improve the disposal of human waste\nby  increasing  the  use  of  small  sewerage  schemes  with  local  treatment,  encouraging  the\ninstallation of adequately designed individual and communal septic tanks, and improving the", "16\nmaintenance of septic tanks by introducing septic tank maintenance services. Whether this\nservice will be operated by the MC or contracted out to a private operator will depend on the\nMC\u2019s capacity, and realistic projections of the potential revenue resulting from service charges.\n57. Drainage.  Subprojects  will  focus  on  routine  cleaning  and  rehabilitation  of  existing\nsystems,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  interconnection  of  isolated  stretches  of  drainage\nchannels into a fully integrated drainage network. Priority areas will be high-density, low-income\nareas,  where  project  intervention  will  result  in  a  marked  improvement  of  living  conditions.\nInvestments  in  new  works  will  focus  on  establishing  drainage  networks  including  suitable\noutfalls. Drainage subprojects will all include the establishment of maintenance procedures and\nsystems,  and  where  necessary,  supported  by  the  provision  of  basic  drainage  cleaning\nequipment.\n58. Solid Waste Management. Subprojects will aim at minimal investment for collection\nsystems,  thereby  requiring  community  support  through  waste  minimization  and  the\nconcentration of waste to neighborhood collection points. Emphasis will be placed on increasing\nthe cash contribution from commercial establishments. Where waste collection equipment is to\nbe  provided  under  the  subproject,  it  will  be  based  on  practicality  and  affordability,  and\nappropriate  to  the  particular  urban  environment.  Waste  disposal  sites  and  new  landfill\ndevelopments will be supported contingent upon the identification of suitable disposal sites that\nmeet established environmental guidelines and controls.\n59. Roads and Local Access. Subprojects in the road sector will rehabilitate and improve\nthe main urban road network by resurfacing and widening within the existing right-of-way.\nImproved  access  to  the  town  center  and  local  neighborhoods  will  increase  economic\nopportunities by attracting investment. Road projects include the improvement of associated\nroadside drains. Part of the subproject will involve traffic management measures to improve\ncirculation  in  congested  town-center  areas,  through  junction  improvement  and  introducing\nrestrictions on parking and roadside vending. Other subprojects will include the extension of the\nroad network, and opening up new areas for controlled development.\nb.  Community Development and Participation\n60. This subcomponent will aim to develop organizational and human capacity within local\ngovernment  for  participatory  processes  targeted  at  poverty  reduction  and  basic  needs\nprograms. During project preparation, a socioeconomic survey was undertaken in the seven\nfirst-phase  towns,  along  with  public  hearings,  group  interviews,  and  a  selected  household\nsurvey.  In addition, consultations with NGOs and CBOs were initiated during the various town\nmeetings. Where possible, households headed by women were interviewed to develop a better\nunderstanding of their problems and perceived priorities. Urban sector policies in the past were\nfragmented and resulted in a serious erosion of public trust in state mechanisms and their ability\nto provide sustainable public facilities and services to urban communities. As a consequence,\nthe increase in self-help initiatives and in new partnerships between communities, NGOs, and\nthe private sector is significant. Under the Project, CBOs will be established, where they do not\nexist within the participating town, and mechanisms established to develop greater partnerships\nbetween the communities and local governments. For existing CBOs, these relationships will be\nstrengthened,  with  greater  focus  on  this  partnership  role,  and  the  development  of  better\nmunicipal management.\n2. Institutional Development Component\n61. The institutional development component consists of project implementation support,\nmunicipal finance capacity building, and incremental administration support, all linked to support\nthe Government\u2019s devolution program, while building the capacity of urban local governments.", "17\na. Project Implementation Support\n62.   Involvement  in  the  Project  will  encourage  the  MCs  to  take  a  more  active  role  in\nplanning, preparing, designing, and managing the implementation of development initiatives\nwithin their area, to the benefit of their constituency, largely consisting of the urban poor.\nCommitment to such involvement is required for participation in the Project. The MCs will be\nhelped to establish, from within their own ranks, a project implementation team (PIT) dedicated\nto project preparation and implementation. The management of the entire project cycle is the\nprimary responsibility of the MC, with the Project\u2019s project coordination unit (PCU) and its TA\nteam taking a guiding and monitoring role.\nb. Municipal Finance and Capacity Building\n63. In recognition of the critical importance of improved financial performance and increased\nrevenue collection by the MCs, a specific component of the Project\u2019s institutional development is\ndedicated to improving municipal financial management, by introducing improved accounting\nprocedures and management information systems. With greater devolution of power to the local\ngovernment levels, especially for the management of urban services, along with greater fiscal\nautonomy,  the  development  of  improved  financial  management  systems  and  enhanced\nresource generation is critical to the long-term sustainability of the urban centers. With the\nassistance of the consultants, the MCs will develop and implement a computerized accounting\nsystem;  improved  financial  management  and  information  systems,  including  budgeting,\nresource  mobilization,  and  enhanced  O&M  of  existing  assets;  and  improved  billing  and\ncollection systems.\nc. Incremental Administration Support\n64. Incremental  administrative  support  for  project  implementation  is  required  for  the\nprovincial and local governments. A PCU, consisting of LGERD staff, will be responsible for\nprovincial  coordination,  planning,  and  management  of  project  activities.  A  team  of  12\nprofessional staff, representing various disciplines, and administrative support staff, will be\nrequired. At the local level, a PIT will be established in each participating town to oversee\nsubproject planning, design, and implementation; and maintain close linkages with associated\nNGOs and CBOs. One of the major objectives of this subcomponent is to develop greater\nownership at the town level.\nC. Cost Estimates\n65. The Project is estimated to cost $30.0 million equivalent, with foreign exchange costs of\nabout $8.7 million, or about 29 percent of the total project cost, including $0.5 million for interest\nduring construction. Local currency costs are $21.3 million equivalent, or about 71 percent of\nthe total project cost. The cost of the infrastructure component includes civil works, equipment\nand materials, survey, and detailed design and supervision. Table 1 provides summary of the\nproject costs.", "18\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currencya\nCost\nA.

Financing Plan\n66. The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  $20.8  million  equivalent  from  the  Special  Funds\nresources, which will represent 69 percent of the total project cost. The loan will cover 98\npercent of the foreign exchange cost component of the Project and 58 percent of the local\ncurrency cost, excluding taxes. The Borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The\nBorrower will pass on loan funds to NWFP on the same terms and conditions as those between\nADB and the Borrower. The Borrower will assume the foreign exchange risk on the loan. NWFP,\ntogether with the participating MCs, will cover the remaining 31 percent of the project cost,\napproximately $9.2 million equivalent, which includes (i) $7.4 million equivalent from NWFP,\nincluding $0.25 million in foreign currency cost for funding the international municipal finance\nmanagement  advisor  position  of  13  person-months  under  the  Institutional  Development\nComponent; and (ii) $1.8 million equivalent from the MCs for incremental administration. ADB's\nfinancing of local currency expenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, which will\nimprove the living and health conditions of the people in the project areas by upgrading existing\nunsanitary conditions, improving water supply services, and preventing damage to property and\ndisruption of lives caused by localized flooding. Communities will contribute to the cost of\nimplementing and sustaining sanitation and drainage subprojects where practicable. A summary\nof the financing arrangements is shown in Table 2.\n67. The MCs will be required to finance the incremental administration cost associated with\ntheir involvement in the Project, and a minimum of 20 percent of the cost of town-specific\nsubproject capital works costs, increasing to a maximum of 50 percent based on the MC\u2019s\ncurrent and projected financial capacity at the time of subproject approval, through subloans\nusing project funds. This loan proportion takes account of the MCs\u2019 financial capacity, including\nability  to  impose  user  fees  for  full  cost-recovery  purposes.  Tripartite  subsidiary  project\nagreements, including grant and subloan components, will be entered into between the NWFP\nDepartment of Finance, LGERD, and the participating MCs. Subloans to the MCs will be at an\ninterest rate of 7 percent per annum, with a grace period of 3 years and repayment of principal\nover a subsequent 12-year period. The subsidiary project agreements will include standard\nterms and conditions for implementation of the subproject, and will be supported by a loan\nagreement between the NWFP Department of Finance and the Ministry of Finance. As subloans", "19\nare repaid, the NWFP Department of Finance has the opportunity to relend funds to other\nproject MCs and other local governments for investment in urban infrastructure, thus enhancing\nthe sustainability of future urban sector investment by local governments. Funds will be repaid\nto the Ministry of Finance, according to its debt service obligations on the ADB loan. Details of\nthe proposed financing arrangements are shown in Appendix 10.\nTable 2: Financing Plana\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB 8.5 12.3 20.8 69\nNWFP Government 0.2 7.2 7.4 25\nMunicipal Committees 0.0 1.8b 1.8 6\n         Total 8.7 21.3 30.0 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NWFP = North-West Frontier Province.\na   Excludes beneficiary contributions to sanitation subprojects.\nb   Based on cost of incremental administration by MCs.\nE. Executing Agency\n68. The Executing Agency for the Project will be the NWFP government through LGERD.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Implementing Agencies\n69. A project steering committee will be established prior to loan effectiveness to oversee\nthe Project, and to be chaired by the Secretary LGERD, with committee members consisting of\nrepresentatives from DOF, PDD, WSD, and departments handling the functions of PPHD,\nPHED and environmental concerns. The steering committee will meet at least twice a year and\nas often as required.\n70. The PCU, established in LGERD before loan negotiations, will (i) prepare the overall\nproject implementation plan and the consolidated annual work plan, (ii) coordinate and appraise\nsubproject proposals, (iii) provide technical support and supervision functions for subproject\nimplementation,  (iv)  plan  and  coordinate  activities  to  improve  local  government  financial\nmanagement, (v) plan and guide community participation, (vi) advise on terms of reference and\nconsultant  selection  for  design  and  supervision  of  subprojects,  (vii)  facilitate  project\ncoordination,  (viii)  prepare  consolidated  progress  reports  and  documentation,  (ix)  organize\nproject  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  activities,  and  (x)  prepare  the  project\ncompletion report. The PCU\u2019s large agenda of activities range from the continual monitoring of\nMC participation criteria to providing technical support and supervisory functions for subproject\nimplementation. The PCU will be headed by a Project Director from LGERD and have 12\nprofessional staff, supported by international and domestic consultants.\n71. At the local government level, PITs will be established within each participating MC to\nmanage subproject implementation. Procurement of goods and services for all subprojects will\nbe initiated by the PITs and will be ratified by a local bid evaluation committee, including\nrepresentation from the MC, PCU, and district councils. Each PIT will comprise four professional\nstaff,  identified  from  the  MC\u2019s  permanent  professional  cadre,  and  managed  by  a  senior\nengineer. Details of the project organization are given in Appendix 11.", "20\n2.  Participation in the Project\na.  Criteria\n72. Urban towns to be included in the Project will need to show willingness to provide\ntechnical staff to manage and implement the subprojects, and adequate financial capacity to\nservice debt requirements. Subprojects10 will be identified and prepared through a subproject\nplanning  and  appraisal  process  under  which  user  demands,  and  financial,  economic,  and\naffordability  considerations  are  fully  integrated  with  technical,  environmental,  social,  and\ninstitutional factors. Least-cost technical solutions will be a focus of the subprojects. A total of 11\ncore subprojects were prepared during the TA; these subprojects are representative of the high\npriority  urban  infrastructure  improvements  in  accordance  with  the  needs  of  the  first-phase\nparticipating urban towns, and in the context of the town\u2019s development plans. Based on the\ncurrent  financial  and  management  capacity  of  the  first-phase  towns,  the  proposed  core\nsubprojects include water supply, sewerage and drainage, solid waste management, and road\nimprovements. Their financial internal rates of return range from 6 to 17 percent.\n73. Entry participation of MCs in the Project will be conditional on (i) setting up a PIT from\nthe existing staff cadre, consisting of at least a senior qualified municipal engineer, bookkeeper,\nclerk, and senior officer to be assigned as a community liaison officer; (ii) undertaking to\nimplement an updated improved accounting system and management information systems to\nbe provided under the Project; (iii) committing to increase revenues to implement proposed\nsubprojects; (iv) agreeing to finance a minimum of 20 percent of subproject capital works cost,\nand up to a maximum of 50 percent based on the current and projected financial capacity; (v)\nhaving an up-to-date base map, with the outline of an urban structure plan as a guide for future\ndevelopment; and (vi) providing evidence of preparedness to implement an improved municipal\nfinance and accounting procedures.\nb. Subproject Selection and Preparation\n74. Subprojects will be located in participating project towns throughout NWFP, and will be\nsmall to moderate in value (most will be between $100,000 and $1 million equivalent). Priority\nsubproject investments will be identified by the MCs; feasibility studies will be prepared by the\nPIT, appraised by the PCU, and approved by ADB. Management action and financial plans\nprepared by the MCs upon acceptance into the Project will be updated as required to ensure\nthat the MCs implement actions required to continue development of long-term technical and\nfinancial capacity. This process will ensure that the proposed investments are focused, respond\nto local basic needs and demand for services, designed to appropriate standards, suitably\njustified, and sustainable. Prior to approval of any subproject, the MC will have undertaken the\nfollowing actions to improve its financial capacity: (i) register all water connections; (ii) ensure\nthat the immovable property tax register has been updated; (iii) identify potential municipal\nincome at least for water fees and immovable property tax, and current and potential collection\nefficiencies; (iv) develop a time-bound action plan, in coordination with the provincial urban\nsector policy action plan, to increase revenue at least from water fees and immovable property\ntax; and (v) agree to implement a program of user fees for solid waste collection and cleaning of\nseptic tanks.\n75. Requests for subprojects with outline project description, and rationale will originate from\nthe MCs. Successful subprojects will provide basic urban services and needs, be directly aimed\nat poverty reduction and improving economic opportunities, and have a low investment with\nemphasis on improved processes for rehabilitating and maintaining existing municipal assets.\n                  \n10\nA subproject is defined as an urban infrastructure investment package in a single subsector.", "21\nAggregate investment for subprojects per town will not exceed the equivalent of $1 million.\nFollowing confirmation that the proposed subproject(s) meet the agreed eligibility criteria for\nfunding under the Project, the MC through its PIT will proceed with subproject preparation, with\ntechnical guidance from the project staff at the PCU when required. Subproject appraisal reports\nwill  include  (i)  the  rationale,  scope,  target  beneficiaries,  design  standards,  cost,  and\nimplementation  and  procurement  arrangements;  (ii)  environmental  clearances,  and  social,\neconomic,  and  financial  justification;  (iii)  evidence  of  technical,  managerial,  and  financial\nperformance of the MC to demonstrate that it will be able to cover O&M costs and debt service\nassociated with the proposed subproject; and (iv) identification of actions to update the MC\u2019s\nmanagement and financial action plan to take into account the proposed subproject. Feasibility\nstudies will be documented in standardized subproject appraisal reports.\n76. Following approval by ADB, the MC will sign a subsidiary project agreement with the\nDepartment of Finance, and with LGERD as a party to the agreement, regarding the loan and\ngrant component of the subproject. This agreement will describe any conditions and covenants\nthat must be satisfied by the MC before or during subproject implementation. Prior to signing,\nthe first subsidiary project agreement will be submitted to ADB for approval.\nc. Community Participation\n77. Particular emphasis will be given to developing forms and mechanisms for community\nparticipation  that  are  appropriate  to  the  sociocultural  and  political  environment  of  urban\ncommunities  in  small  towns  in  NWFP.    Lessons  can  be  learned  from  the  successful\nestablishment of CBOs as a means to plan and deliver small-scale infrastructure improvements\nwithin the Community Infrastructure Program in NWFP.  While these were predominantly in rural\nareas,  important  lessons  can  nevertheless  be  drawn.  Participatory  techniques  need  to  be\ndesigned to improve communication between community groups and government, and to make\ngovernment more responsive to the priority needs of its constituency.\n78. The community participation component of the program will be planned and designed by\nthe community development adviser as part of the institutional development team to the PCU.\nFor project towns, mechanisms need to be established to organize and mobilize communities to\nparticipate in improving delivery of urban services in general, and in the project activities in\nparticular. The form, nature, and mechanism of this participation will vary depending on the type\nof subproject, and the interests, willingness, and skills of the community. The integration of the\nparticipatory processes with current operations will be a focus of the community participation\ncomponent.\n79. The  Project  will  include  one  or  more  NWFP-based  NGOs  to  establish  sustainable\ngovernment-community partnerships in the development of effective and lasting channels of\ncommunication. The NGO activities will be coordinated by the community development adviser\nin  the  PCU.  The  objectives  of  the  NGO  involvement  will  be  to  (i)  jointly  determine  the\nappropriate nature and extent of community participation; (ii) assist with formulating suitable\nmechanisms for government-community interaction; and (iii) develop organizational and human\ncapacity within local government for participatory processes aimed at poverty reduction and\nbasic needs activities.\n3.  Consulting Services\n80. To  support  Project  implementation,  396  person-months  of  consulting  services  (36\nperson-months international and 360 person-months domestic) will be required, covering (i)\nproject  management  support  to  the  PCU  and  PITs,  including  subproject  preparation  and\nappraisal, and capacity building for subproject implementation by local government agencies\n(214 person-months); and (ii) capacity building for municipal financial management to the MCs,", "22\nto improve accounting systems and increase local revenues (182 person-months). Consultants\nwill support staff within LGERD and the MCs. The consultants will be engaged through a firm in\naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. In addition, one or more\nNWFP-based NGOs, to be recruited by the government, in consultation with ADB, and in\naccordance with guidelines established in PDD for NGO recruitment, will be involved in the\nprocess of establishing sustainable government-community partnerships, for the development of\neffective and lasting channels of communication. Outline terms of reference for consultants are\ngiven in Appendix 12.\n4.  Procurement\n81. Procurement will generally be carried out by the MCs under the guidance of the PCU. All\nprocurement will follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Since most of the project sites will be\nsmall and scattered, the Project is not likely to attract international civil works contractors. All\ncivil  works  subprojects  are  expected  to  be  less  than  $1.0  million  and  will  therefore  be\nundertaken through local competitive bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.\nEach subproject should be procured as a single contract. Where the contract value exceeds\n$1.0 million, the contract will be procured through international competitive bidding procedures.\nEquipment items that are locally available and cost more than $50,000 equivalent and less than\n$100,000 equivalent may be procured through local competitive bidding, while items costing\nless than $50,000 may be procured through direct purchase in accordance with procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB.  International  shopping  will  be  followed  for  materials  and  equipment\npackages estimated to cost more than $100,000 but less than $500,000 equivalent, while\nmaterials and equipment packages costing in excess of $500,000 equivalent will be procured\nthrough international competitive bidding procedures. All procurement will be channeled through\nthe PCU for concurrence prior to submission to ADB for approval.\n5.  Disbursement\n82. To ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and to expedite project implementation,\nand subject to ADB\u2019s assessment of the accounting systems and internal control of LGERD, an\nimprest  account  will  be  established  in  LGERD  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness.  The\nestablishment and operation of the imprest account will be in accordance with ADB's Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. The initial deposit to the imprest account will be based on estimated\nexpenditures  for  the  first  four  months  of  project  implementation,  but  will  not  exceed  the\nequivalent  of  $200,000.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  may  be  used  for\nreimbursement of eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances to the imprest account. The\nstatement of expenditures procedure will be applicable to contracts amounting to $50,000 or\nless.\n6.  Operation and Maintenance\n83. Responsibility for O&M of the project facilities will rest with the MCs. Communities will\nalso play an important role in O&M, particularly for solid waste management and drainage\nmaintenance,  where  community  involvement  and  active  participation  is  critical.  Routine\nmaintenance in urban centers in NWFP has deteriorated over recent years, as a result of\ninadequate funding, ill-defined responsibilities, and lack of a service-oriented perception/attitude\nin local government. The emphasis placed in the institutional development component of the\nProject to improve financial management and increase MCs\u2019 resource generation is largely\naimed  at  reversing  this  trend.  Project  guidance  and  monitoring  by  the  PCU  will  focus  on\nevidence  of  tangible  improvement  in  O&M.  Increasing  community  awareness  of  the  MCs\u2019\nconstitutional responsibility for O&M will apply pressure to council staff to improve performance,", "23\nwhile simultaneously identifying a role for community groups in neighborhood maintenance.\nSubproject agreements will emphasize adequate O&M of subprojects as a condition for financial\nsupport.\n7. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n84. By their nature, only solid waste disposal, drainage, and road improvement subprojects\ncan be expected to require any land acquisition, and even this will be minimal. During project\npreparation,  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  was  identified  for  core  subprojects.  The\napproval  of  subproject  appraisal  reports  will  be  conditional  on  the  inclusion  of  a  detailed\ntimetable for land acquisition that is acceptable to ADB. Resettlement of people is unlikely. If\ninvoluntary resettlement is unavoidable, a resettlement plan will be prepared by the MC, with the\nassistance of the project consultants and in consultation with the community. The resettlement\nplan,  which  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  the\nHandbook on Resettlement, 1998, will be submitted to ADB for its review and approval as part\nof the subproject appraisal report.\n8.  Public-Private and Community Partnerships\n85. Some of the subprojects proposed appear suitable for private sector involvement with\nO&M.  In  particular,  the  solid  waste  management  and  the  septic  tank  desludging  service\npromoted as part of the Project are primary targets for private sector operation. However,\ncurrent conditions in MCs are not immediately conducive to effective public-private partnerships.\nThe present record on cost recovery of basic services by collecting fees and charges is such\nthat local entrepreneurs are unlikely to be interested in assuming service contracts. In addition,\nthe MCs have had little or no experience in formulating or effectively managing private sector\nservice contracts.\n86. The potential for community partnerships in the delivery of urban services, the form of\nparticipation developed, and the role of each partner will be influenced by the complexity of work\nto be undertaken and the degree to which the community feels ownership of the work being\ncarried out.  The array of service types (water, sanitation, solid waste, etc.), the scale of these\nservices  (primary,  secondary,  or  tertiary),  and  stage  of  their  implementation  (planning,\nconstruction,  or  maintenance)  create  a  range  of  opportunities  for  participation.  Therefore,\nservice  delivery  must  be  disaggregated,  to  consider  the  potential  roles  of  partners  at  the\ndifferent levels and to integrate these into a practical implementation proposal.\n9.  Implementation Schedule\n87. The Project will be implemented over six years, beginning in early 2002, with completion\nby 31 December 2007. The Project is expected to be undertaken in three phases, with three\nbatches  of  provincial  towns.  Phase  1  will  involve  seven  towns,  with  subprojects  already\nappraised, and ready for detailed design and implementation. Subprojects for phases 2 and 3\nwill include groups of about five towns that come on stream in years 2 and 3, at approximately\n18-month intervals. The six-year implementation period is considered appropriate, given the\nlarge number of subprojects, the geographic spread of the Project, and the institutional capacity\nof the local governments. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 13.", "24\n10. Monitoring and Reporting\na. Midterm Review\n88. A midterm review will be carried out within three years of loan effectiveness. The review\nwill  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  project  implementation  arrangements,  with\nprogress checked against the designed targets, consultations with community groups, and a\nreview of the institutional and policy development aspects.\nb. Project Performance Monitoring System\n89. The Government will ensure that a comprehensive performance monitoring program\nacceptable to ADB is implemented to monitor and evaluate the technical performance and\nsocial  and  economic  benefits  of  the  Project,  especially  to  the  poor  and  women.  The\nperformance monitoring indicators and procedures will be tested with respect to data availability\nand  other  constraints,  revised  if  necessary,  and  institutionalized  as  part  of  the  Project\u2019s\nmanagement  information  system.  Participating  towns  will  be  responsible  for  undertaking\nperiodic monitoring and assessment of the performance monitoring activities for subprojects. To\nmeasure  the  project  impacts  on  the  beneficiaries,  particularly  marginalized  groups  within\nparticipating towns, accurate baseline information must be established at the commencement of\nsubproject implementation, with this information being the basis for determining the resulting\nimpacts. Monitorable indicators will consist of (i) institutional development indicators covering\nrevenue generation and financial management, along with O&M; (ii) subproject implementation\nindicators  for  the  various  categories  and  types  of  urban  infrastructure,  including  levels  of\ncoverage and service delivery; and (iii) sectoral impact indicators, covering economic growth,\npublic health, and community participation aspects.\nc. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n90. The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation. The progress reports, to be prepared by the PITs and consolidated by the PCU,\nwill provide a narrative description of project progress during the period, any modifications to the\nproject schedule, problems and difficulties experienced, and a description of the work to be\ncarried out in the next period. The progress reports will provide summary financial accounts for\nthe Project consisting of project expenditures during the quarter, year-to-date expenditures, and\ntotal  expenditures  to  date.  The  PCU  will  address  the  institutional  and  policy  development\naspects of the Project, and maintain separate accounts for the Project. Detailed annual project\naccounts and statements of the imprest account will be submitted to ADB in audited form within\n9 months of the close of the fiscal year. The auditor appointed to audit the accounts will be\nacceptable to ADB. LGERD will submit to ADB, within three months of physical completion of\nthe Project, a project completion report that will cover the details of project implementation,\ncosts, BME activities and results at that time, compliance with loan covenants, and other\ninformation that may be requested by ADB.\nd. Management and Financial Action Plans\n91. The need to define a base from which improved financial and technical management\ncapabilities of the MCs can be developed is essential for long-term sustainability of urban\ninfrastructure provision. The means of subsequent management improvement will only flow from\nfuture actions of (i) the MCs; (ii) the NWFP Government through its influence on water tariffs\nand collection of the immovable property tax; and (iii) support and changes in the environment\nin which the MCs operate, and promoted as a result of the devolution initiatives of the federal\nGovernment. Financial management performance will continue to be critical to MC capacity", "25\nthroughout and beyond the project period. Continuous improvement will be required for the\nproduction of management information and annual account preparation; production of regular\ncash flow statements; liability identification; and most critically, regular review of tariffs and\ncharges and collection efficiency. To improve their financial capacity to contract loans, the MCs\nmust (i) ensure that revenue growth is incorporated into their charging policy, and (ii) exercise\ndiscipline in formulating future expenditure plans against the background of known financial\nliabilities. Participating MCs will be required to report to the PCU on implementation of financial\nmanagement action plans, and in the event of shortfalls, will discuss and agree on interventions\nnecessary to achieve the original targets.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n92. The  Project  will  address  environmental  and  social  issues  related  to  identifying,\npreparing, and implementing subprojects, and will take steps to alleviate negative environmental\nand social aspects. Sample initial environmental examinations (IEEs) of selected prepared\nsubprojects identify positive impacts on the environment. Initial environmental examinations will\nbe prepared for all subprojects in accordance with relevant Government regulations and ADB\nguidelines, and documented in the subproject appraisal reports. The Environmental Protection\nAgency, originally located within PDD, and created in October 1992, was upgraded and made a\nregular attached department on 4 November 1993. The agency, headed by a director general, is\nresponsible  for  enforcing  environmental  laws  and  standards  across  all  departments  and\norganizations within the province. In addition, an environment section was commissioned within\nPDD on 20 January 1992. This section is responsible for developing environmental plans and\npolicies,  and  integrating  environmental  concerns  in  development  planning.  Environmental\nimpact assessments of public sector projects, will be reviewed by the environment section to\nensure  that  environmentally  damaging  projects  are  not  approved.  Initial  environmental\nexaminations will be prepared initially at the local government level and, if necessary, through\nthe department for environment at the provincial level.\n2. Social\n93. Social measures will be incorporated into the preparation of subprojects by consulting\nwith  beneficiary  groups,  particularly  women  and  the  poor,  CBOs,  and  NGOs  to  ensure\nmaximum participation of such groups in subproject identification, preparation, implementation,\nand O&M of completed subprojects. CBOs are by far the most important community group as\nthey generally represent low-income communities and are found in most of the urban towns.\nCBOs represent a community structure in low-income neighborhoods that can be tapped during\nproject implementation. In project towns where CBOs do not exist, NGOs recruited under the\nProject will assist in establishing CBOs. Sample perception surveys carried out in the first-phase\nproject towns provide an assessment of public perceptions of urban infrastructure, urban service\ndelivery, community priorities, absorptive capacity, willingness to pay, and gender issues.\n94. Each  PIT,  in  association  with  NGOs  and  CBOs,  will  develop  and  implement  a\ncoordinated public information, education, and participation program with the participating local\ngovernments. The program, which will be sustained over the duration of the Project, will focus\non (i) the proper use of the facilities; (ii) the benefits of good hygiene and public health; and (iii)\ncommunity  participation  through  a  consultative  process  with  community  leaders  and\nspokespersons, including women, to determine existing and future needs and to establish day-\nto-day activities for adequate O&M of public facilities.", "26\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic and Financial Analyses\n1. Analyses\n95. Indicative economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of return\n(FIRRs) for a representative range of subprojects are shown in Appendix 14. The evaluations\nindicate (i) an EIRR of 17 percent for road improvements, based on savings in vehicle operating\ncosts and personal travel time savings; (ii) an FIRR of 6 percent for sanitation improvements,\nbased on indications of willingness to pay; (iii) an FIRR of 7 percent for solid waste, based on\nindications of willingness to pay and reduced O&M costs to clear drains; and (iv) an FIRR of 11\npercent for improved water supply, based on increased revenue from tariffs. An analysis of the\nsensitivity of the results of the evaluations to changes in key variables (including a 10 percent\nincrease in capital costs, a 10 percent reduction in benefits, a delay of one year in subproject\nbenefits, and combinations of these changes) indicates that, with the exception of the road\nimprovement project, the EIRRs and FIRRs fall to generally very low levels.\n96. Given  the  subprojects'  focus  on  public  good,  and  the  external  socioeconomic  and\nenvironmental  benefits  that  will  accrue  from  them,  but  which  cannot  be  quantified  fully  in\nfinancial or economic terms, the EIRRs and the FIRRs of the sample subprojects indicate the\npotential for returns from the investments to be reasonable. In the sensitivity analysis for the\nsubprojects, the lowest EIRR and FIRR were both 4.1 percent, with the FIRR exceeding the\nweighted average cost of capital of 2.5 percent incurred by the MCs to implement subprojects.\n2. Financial Projections for Urban Towns\n97. The seven first-phase MCs currently have positive, though modest, cash balances. The\ntowns have generally achieved a small excess of revenue over expenditure in recent years, but\nall incurred a deficit in 1997/98 due to unusually large increases in expenditure. With modest\nreserves, the towns have limited capacity to operate deficits, and thus keep their income and\nexpenditure broadly in balance. From 1996/97 to 1998/99, the MCs were able to undertake\ndevelopment expenditure that was, on average, equal to 15 percent of their total outlays.\nHowever, the modest financial turnover of the MCs resulted in total capital outlays for the seven\ntowns of only PRs5 million per annum. Achieving a sustainable increase in investment in public\ninfrastructure through the Project by participating MCs will require a substantial increase in their\nrevenue to finance the incremental administrative cost of implementing subprojects, improved\nO&M, and eventually, debt service on subloans. This will be supported by implementation of\nimproved accounting and financial management procedures by MCs through the municipal\nfinance capacity building component of the Project.\n3. Cost Recovery, Subsidies, and Sustainability\n98. Surveys indicate only limited willingness by the community to pay for improved services\n(about PRs11 per household per month for improved drainage and sanitation, and PRs25 per\nhousehold per month for improved water supply), despite current high levels of morbidity due to\nwaterborne diseases. The community development and participation component of the Project\nis designed to increase public understanding and ownership of subprojects to improve the\ncapacity to impose higher charges to improve cost recovery.", "27\nB.  Social Dimensions\n99. The urban infrastructure and community development components of the Project will\nimprove  living  conditions,  the  local  environment,  and  the  provision  of  services  needed  by\nhouseholds and businesses in up to 24 MCs with a current total population of about 1.0 million.\nThe direct beneficiaries of improvements in urban infrastructure and services include people\nwho will gain access to new services, and people for whom existing services will be improved.\nIn  addition,  indirect  benefits  related  to  improved  solid  waste  management,  environmental\nsanitation, and drainage will accrue to the general population living in the towns covered by the\nProject.  The  involvement  of  the  public  in  subprojects  will  complement  and  reinforce  the\nimmediate economic and health benefits associated with water supply, drainage, sanitation, and\nsolid waste management components of the Project by ensuring sustainability and ownership.\n100. The  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  is  high  in  towns,  with  about  80  percent  of\nhouseholds surveyed in the initial project towns reporting that a member of the household had\nbeen ill during the month prior to the survey. Improved access to water supply and solid waste\nservices will save time, raise public health standards, and reduce the physical burden for\nwomen and children, who are mainly responsible for carrying water and garbage. The sanitation\nand drainage components will raise public health standards by diverting effluent to suitable\noutfalls away from residential areas and by increasing the treatment of effluent. Improved health\nstandards will reduce the number of school days and workdays lost to illness and medical\nexpenditures. The drainage components will reduce the risk of flood damage to property, and\nhealth  risks  resulting  from  flooding  and  stagnant  water.  Road  subprojects  will  ease  traffic\ncongestion, facilitate access and mobility, improve road safety, and reduce the level of air\npollution and noise.\n101. The Project will consider and address the needs of, in particular, the urban poor, women\nand  children.  The  selection  criteria  for  subprojects,  and  design  and  implementation\narrangements, will ensure that subprojects are targeted to primarily benefit these groups. The\ncommunity development and participation component of the Project will maximize community\ninvolvement, by both beneficiary groups and CBOs, in subproject identification, preparation, and\nimplementation,  and  will  increase  the  awareness  of  MC  staff  of  their  responsibilities  and\ncommunity expectations. This will be critical for the ultimate success of the Project and the\nsustainability of the benefits it delivers (Appendix 15).\n102. The Project will improve the living conditions of up to 400,000 residents in about 26\nurban centers and will enhance the quality of life and health, improve the environment, and\ncreate conditions conducive to sustained urban development and economic growth. The Project\nwill contribute to a reduction in mortality, morbidity, and poverty, and the loss of amenity\nassociated with environmental degradation in the urban centers, among all segments of the\ncommunity,  especially  among  slum  inhabitants  and  poor  groups,  particularly  women  and\nchildren, who are estimated to make up 15 percent of the urban population. The Project will also\nsupport  improvements  to  the  capacity  of  local  governments,  improving  their  financial  and\noperational management and planning, including local resource generation.\nC.  Impact on Poverty\n103. Two notable sources of substantially increased income are the immovable property tax,\nwhich is entirely the responsibility of the NWFP government, and water charges, the rates for\nwhich are set by the NWFP government. The MCs and the NWFP government have indicated a\nwillingness to implement actions to increase MC revenue. Immediately required actions are to (i)\ninitiate incremental increases in water charges over the first two years of project implementation\nto PRs85 per household per month; (ii) identify and regularize illegal water connections; and (iii)", "28\nprepare a clear tax base for the immovable property tax, to identify potential income from the\ntax, and to implement a plan to significantly increase revenue from the tax, especially in MCs\nwhere current collection efficiency is below 10 percent. The real level of the water rate will need\nto be increased by about 5 percent per annum so that expenditure on O&M can be increased\nand full cost recovery for water services eventually achieved.\n104. Surveys indicate only limited willingness by the community to pay for improved services\ndespite high levels of morbidity due to waterborne diseases. Increased confidence in MC ability\nto deliver improved water, drainage, sanitation, and waste disposal services, and enhanced\nunderstanding of the benefits of these improvements are needed to boost the community\u2019s\nwillingness  to  pay  for  the  benefits  that  will  accrue.  The  community  development  and\nparticipation component of the Project is designed to support this process. The potential exists\nto add a surcharge to water charges or the immovable property tax to recover the cost of\nproviding improved drainage, sanitation, and waste disposal services. Specific charges can be\nimposed  for  solid  waste  disposal  from  concentrated  sources  of  waste  such  as  markets,\ncommercial areas, and industrial sites.\n105. Financial projections for the seven MCs initially proposed for inclusion in the Project\nindicate a capacity and general willingness to generate sufficient revenue to meet incremental\nadministration and O&M costs, and debt service associated with subprojects implementation.\nThe principal sources of additional revenue are the immovable property tax and water charges,\nand  revenue  from  charges  for  infrastructure  and  services  resulting  from  subprojects.  The\nfinancial projections indicate the potential for the MCs to service subloans, with the minimum\ndebt service coverage ratio being an acceptable 3.1. If a substantial increase in income from the\nimmovable property tax and water charges cannot be achieved the ability for MCs to undertake\nimproved O&M and to service subloans will be jeopardized.\n106. A proposed incremental increase in the cost of water over the first two years of project\nimplementation from PRs60 to PRs85 per household per month is expected to increase the\naverage level of O&M costs in the seven first-phase project towns from the current 46 percent to\n60 percent after allowing for an increase in O&M costs to a more adequate level. The higher\nrate of PRs85 per household per month is equal to 2 percent of average 25th percentile\nhousehold income of PRs4,500 per household per month, which suggests that the real level of\nwater tariffs could still be increased, while still ensuring adequate access to water by low income\nhouseholds. However, continuing real increases in recurrent expenditure are needed to bring\nO&M to a level that will enable current water supply systems to be sustained over the long term.\nAccordingly, full cost recovery for water supply systems is unlikely to be achievable during\nproject implementation. However, where water meters are installed, water charges should be\nadjusted to achieve full cost recovery within three years; higher charges can be imposed for\nusers of large quantities of water while ensuring that low income groups have access to water at\nan affordable rate.\n107. The lack of a tradition of user charges for sanitation, drainage, and solid waste disposal\nmakes it difficult to achieve full cost recovery for these services. Moreover, under ADB\u2019s policy\non subsidies, moderate cost subsidy can be provided for these services because of their pubic\ngood features and the positive externalities that result from their presence. User charges for\nsolid waste collection and sanitation will be initiated for the Project, albeit at a low level initially\nand  with  real  increases  in  charges  over  time  as  household  income  rises  and  community\nacceptance of the approach increases. In the meantime, the immovable property tax provides\nthe  most  effective  means  to  finance  the  cross-subsidy  for  those  services  where  full  cost\nrecovery is not achieved; the tax is mildly progressive and is used in many countries as a\nmeans to finance urban services such as drainage and solid waste collection. This reinforces\nthe critical need to increase the collection efficiency for the immovable property tax.", "29\n108. The public good features and the positive externalities of the subprojects justify the\nprovision of a maximum of 80 percent of the cost of subprojects as a grant, with the MCs\nborrowing the remaining minimum 20 percent of the cost of the capital works of the subprojects.\nThe NWFP government and MCs will also finance incremental administration and O&M costs\nfor  subproject  implementation  and  debt  service  obligations  from  their  own  resources,\nsupplemented  by  enhanced  user  charges.  The  community  development,  institutional\ndevelopment, and municipal finance capacity building assistance provided under the Project will\nimprove financial management and community understanding; this should enable subsidies to\nbe reduced and O&M improved, thereby ensuring project sustainability.\nD.  Risks\n109. The major risks associated with the Project include (i) NWFP government borrowing\ncapacity;  (ii)  uncertainties  relating  to  the  effective  implementation  of  devolution  of\nresponsibilities  to  the  local  governments,  (iii)  limited  institutional  capacity  of  the  local\ngovernments to respond to additional devolved responsibilities, and (iv) low financial capacity of\nthe  MCs  resulting  in  fewer  participating  urban  towns  and  subprojects  than  projected.  The\nProject involves a significant degree of policy initiatives. It will be implemented through the local\ngovernments, and with extensive community participation to develop project ownership, leading\nto greater accountability at the local level. The major project risks have been minimized and will\nbe adequately responded to by the Project.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n110. The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\nassurances incorporated in the legal documents.\n(i)  The NWFP government, in line with the Government\u2019s devolution program (Local\nGovernment  Plan  2000),  will  implement  the  time-bound  Urban  Sector  Policy\nAction  Plan,  and  will  advise  ADB  on  an  annual  basis  of  actions  taken  to\nimplement the plan.\n(ii)  Existing block water tariffs within the MCs will be incrementally increased over\nthe first two years of project implementation, from the present level of PRs60 per\nhousehold per month, to PRs85 per household per month, along with measures\nto improve collection of water charges.\n(iii)  The  NWFP  government  will  agree  to  the  full  application  of  the  immovable\nproperty tax in all participating MCs, as a condition of participation in the Project,\nalong with an incremental increase in the existing tax base.\n(iv)  The  NWFP  government  will  ensure  that  each  participating  MC  will  have\nestablished a PIT prior to acceptance in the Project.\n(v)  Each participating MC will be required to commit a minimum of 20 percent, and\nup  to  a  maximum  of  50  percent,  based  on  the  MCs  current  and  projected\nfinancial capacity at the time of subproject approval, of the total cost of the capital\nworks of each subproject to be implemented within their respective town.\n(vi)  Participating MCs will prepare management and financial action plans for their\ntechnical and financial management strengthening, which will show that they can", "30\nmeet their obligations, including the cost of O&M of subprojects and debt service,\nto ensure long-term sustainability, as a criteria for participation in the Project.\n(vii)  The  federal  Government  will  continue  to  accord  priority  to  schemes  and\nprograms aimed at poverty reduction and community participation.\n(viii)  The federal Government will ensure and cause the NWFP government to ensure\nthat the PCU and MCs maintain separate accounts and reports in relation to the\nProject and subprojects that are to be included in the reports and accounts to be\nsubmitted to ADB.\nVII.

Introduction\n1. The legal and institutional framework governing urban planning and management in\nPakistan  involves  a  broad  range  of  federal,  provincial,  and  local  agencies.  Roles  and\nresponsibilities are complex and frequently overlapping. \n2. In the smaller towns in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), the crucial shortcoming of\nprovincial and local governments is the failure to prepare and be guided by any form of plans.\nAny development plan is subject to cancellation or amendment with a new administration. The\nconcept of structure plans, reflecting national and local urban policies and acting as a guide for\nmedium-term urban development and investment plans, is unknown, not recognized in current\nlegislation, and generally not understood. Development control is effectively absent, making the\nenforcement of any policies and programmes impossible.\nB. Legal Framework\n1. Relevant Legislation \n3. NWFP Urban Planning Ordinance 1978. The ordinance prescribes the establishment\nof a provincial urban development board (PUDB), within the Physical Planning and Housing\nDepartment (PPHD), to give, formulate, and amend long-, medium-, and short-term policies for\ndevelopment of NWFP urban areas (so-called development policies). PUDB is empowered to\nestablish local area authorities (LAAs), to undertake detailed planning and implementation,\nincluding fundamental tasks of land-use planning, development control, and building control.\nPUDB is financed by annual development grants from the provincial government, loans from\nfinancial  institutions,  and  profits  from  development  activities.  The  ordinance  permits  any\nplanning  agency  (PDD,  PUDB,  LAAs,  division,  district,  or  urban  area)  to  adopt  land\ndevelopment regulations.\n4. NWFP Local Government Ordinance 1979. The ordinance describes the duties and\nresponsibilities of local councils (LCs) and includes broad provisions for municipal committees\nto produce master plans and other development regulations for their urban areas, as well as\nbuilding regulations. The ordinance provides for LCs to prepare development plans for selected\nschemes. No specific mention is made of zoning as a means of land-use planning and control,\nbut  the  ordinance  does  assign  the  responsibility  for  the  development,  expansion,  and\nimprovement of an area within the municipality. \n5. PUDB Land Development Regulations, 1980. The regulations define matters to be\nprovided within urban development planning schemes (UDPS) and the type of UDPS. The\nregulations include detailed procedures for preparing schemes, and allows PUDB and LAAs to\nmake zonal plans showing the purpose for which any areas can be primarily used.\n6. Local Council (Budget) Rules (1980). The rules prescribe budget procedures and\nfinancial organisation to be adopted by all councils.\n7. National Reference Manual for Planning and Infrastructure Standards (1986).  The\nmanual, produced for the then Ministry of Housing and Works, Environment and Urban Affairs\nDivision, defines standards and targets for the provision of a wide range of (urban) services.\n8. Eighth Five Year Plan (1993\u20131998). The plan provides targets relevant for urban areas", "Appendix 3, page 2\n38\nincluding (i) access to clean water for all; (ii) access to sewerage facilities to all urban areas; (iii)\nincrease in tertiary roads; (iv) provision of town development schemes. A national urbanization\npolicy followed by provincial urbanization policies and a framework for regional development of\nnew towns will be formulated with policy implementation during the plan period. \n9. The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1998\u20132003). Not yet published, an early draft gives priority\nto effective and increased involvement of local bodies in planning, developing and maintaining\nwater supply and sanitation programs.\n2. Procedures\n10. The current sequence of procedures governing the planning and implementation of\ndevelopment projects within urban areas can be outlined as follows:\n(i) directive is issued by the provincial government (PDD, CM), through the chief\nsecretary, to the respective line department;\n(ii) or  an  alternative  until  recently:  proposals  for  investment  into  development\nprojects as generated by members of national or provincial assembly (no longer\nactive);\n(iii) the line departments prioritize the proposals;\n(iv) line department prepares project, prepares PC-I or PC-II for submission to the\nprovincial government (PDD); and\n(v) PC-I sent to PDD for review and concept clearance, and to PDWP for approval\nC. Institutional Framework\n1. Provincial Government Departments\n11. NWFP is divided into seven divisions, each headed by a commissioner. Each division is\ndivided into 24 districts, controlled by deputy commissioner. Each district is divided into tehsils,\npresently  controlled  by  an  assistant  commissioner.  Within  the  district,  certain  areas  are\ndesignated as urban areas, administered by a town council (either a municipal corporation\n(Peshawar),  municipal  committees,  or  town  committees).  Under  the  Local  Government\nOrdinance,  promulgated  in  August  2001,  the  organization  of  local  government  has  been\nrestructured into three levels: district, tehsil, and union, with devolution of power to local level\ngovernments, and the creation of district assemblies. The plan integrates the rural with the\nurban local governments, into one coherent structure, in which the district administration is\nanswerable  to  an  elected  chief  executive  of  the  district.  Citizen  monitoring  by  elected\nrepresentatives, the civil society\u2019s involvement with development, and a system of effective\nchecks and balances, completes the hard core of the political structure and system of the local\ngovernment.\n12. The NWFP government (headed by the chief minister and the chief secretary) includes\nseveral departments (each headed by a secretary) involved with the development of urban\nareas. A summary of the functions and responsibilities of the main departments follows.  In\naddition, several derived agencies and boards reporting to the main urban planning department,\nthe  PPHD,  play  important  roles  in  implementing  development  programs,  particularly  those\nsupported by international funding.\n13. Planning and Development Department. Headed by an additional chief secretary,\nPDD has overall responsibility for planning and development of all sectors in the province,", "Appendix 3, page 3\n39\nincluding policy and procedures. It has a key role, through its coordination function, in preparing\nand reviewing annual budgets of the provincial annual development program (ADP). PDD\nreviews  development  investment  proposals  from  all  line  departments,  and  prepares\nrecommendation to the NWFP government, as part of the plan approval procedures. Most\nissues relevant to urban development fall under PPHD additional secretary and the respective\nchief. \n14. Provincial  Development  Working  Party  (PDWP).  Headed  by  an  additional  chief\nsecretary (development), the PDWP includes secretaries of provincial departments involved\nwith development as members. The party is responsible for reviewing project proposals for\ninclusion in annual plan and five-year plans. It has authority to approve provincial schemes up\nto PRs100 million per scheme. Projects above this value need to be approved at the federal\nlevel, by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP).\n15. Local  Government,  Elections,  and  Rural  Development  Department  (LGERD).\nLGERD is mandated to administer the NWFP Local Government Ordinance (1980). Its Local\nCouncil Board manages activities relevant to local councils and reports directly to the secretary,\nLGERD.\n16. Physical Planning and Housing Department.  PPHD has primary responsibility for the\nplanning  and  implementation  of  physical  infrastructure,  by  implementing  the  NWFP  Urban\nPlanning Ordinance. PPHD is responsible for land-use planning, guiding and controlling urban\ngrowth and development, and planning and implementing projects related to civic facilities.\nPPHD is also responsible for area development schemes, new townships, improvement of\nslums, utilities and urban services, and rehabilitation of public and private housing. \n17. Provincial Urban Development Board. PUDB is a semiautonomous body, with the\nsecretary, PPHD as its managing director. PUDB is entrusted with the formulation of policies for\ndeveloping urban areas and securing compliance by government departments and agencies.\nPUDB has delegated part of its powers on urban development to 6-7 urban development\nauthorities (those of Dera Ismail Khan, Hazara, Kohat, Malakand, Mardan, and Peshawar). In\naddition,  it  includes  the  project  management  unit,  established  to  implement  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank-supported Second Urban Development Project.\n18. Development Authorities (DAs).  Under the legislative framework of the NWFP Urban\nPlanning Ordinance 1980, PUDB established local development authorities (for Dera Ismail\nKhan, Hazara, Kohat, Malakand, Mardan, and Peshawar) to undertake detailed planning and\nimplementation of development plans within a designated area. In practice, the DAs have been\nprimarily  involved  in  providing  serviced  land  for  residential,  commercial,  or  industrial\ndevelopment.    Infrastructure  within  such  schemes  is  to  be  provided  by  the  DAs,  and\nsubsequently  handed  over  to  local  councils.  However,  frequently  councils  are  reluctant  to\naccept responsibility for such maintenance, as no revenue is linked with the greater operational\nresponsibility. DAs in NWFP seem to have all but abandoned their infrastructure development\nrole.\n19. Project  Management  Unit  (PMU).    Established  to  implement  the  Second  Urban\nDevelopment Project (SUDP) and headed by a director general. The PMU was made the\ncounterpart  agency  of  other  urban  development  initiatives,  in  particular  of  the  Community\nInfrastructure  Project  (CIP)  (supported  by  World  Bank,  Swiss  Agency  for  Development\nCooperation, and United Nations Children's Fund, as a spin-off of the Shelter for Low Income\nCommunities Project, originally under the National Housing Authority (NHA). The PMU is now\ndivided into two units, for the SUDP and for CIP.", "Appendix 3, page 4\n40\n20. Public  Health  Engineering  Department  (PHED).  PHED  is  responsible  for  the\ndevelopment of water supply systems in urban and rural areas.  Once completed, urban water\nsupply schemes are usually handed over to the municipal committees (MCs) for operation and\nmaintenance. PHED prescribes water tariffs. Currently, PHED in collaboration with Kreditanstalt\nf\u00fcr Wiederaufbau is experimenting with installing water meters in selected (small) towns (Baffa,\nKulachi, Lachi, Nawan Killi, Nawan Shaher, Thal, and 11 villages). Setting metered water rates\nis the responsibility of the local council managing the system.\n21. Communication and Works Department (CWD). CWD's main relevance for urban\ninfrastructure and services is its mandate to construct, repair, operate, and maintain provincial\nroads  (and  associated  roadside  drains),  bridges,  and  tunnels  in  the  province.  It  is  often\ncontracted  by  the  National  Highways  Authority  (NHA)  to  maintain  sections  of  the  national\nhighway network. Urban roads are the responsibility of local councils, although this may also be\nsubcontracted to CWD for practical purposes. \n22. Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). This is a national institution, with\nprovincial  delegations,  with  a  board  responsible  for  the  provincial  area.  In  addition  to  its\nresponsibilities  in  managing  national  water  resources,  WAPDA  generates,  transmits,  and\ndistributes electric power to households. WAPDA is responsible for reading meters and billing\nconsumers.\n23. Sui Northern Gas Pakistan Ltd.  This company is responsible for transmission and\ndistribution of natural gas to householders; an increasing number of NWFP towns are getting\nconnected with individual metered gas connections.\n24. Cantonment Board.  Part of the Pakistan Army, a cantonment board is responsible for\nplanning, developing, and maintaining urban infrastructure, services, and civic amenities such\nas health and schools. Currently, there are nine boards in NWFP. A cantonment board can be\nopened or closed according to the defence needs of the country. \n2. Urban Local Government\n25. Urban local government in Pakistan was provided by local councils administered by the\nLocal Council Board (LCB) within LGERD. Local councils include the Peshawar Municipal\nCorporation, 29 MCs, and 16 town committees. All project towns are classed as MCs. MCs are\nclassified in categories, depending on the level of revenue1 (Class A: >PRs15 million; Class B:\nbetween PRs5 million and PRs15 million) and Class C (< PRs5 million). No direct correlation\nexists  between  these  categories  and  the  size  of  the  urban  population.  Staffing  levels  as\nassigned by LCB are a function of category, not of urban population. \n26. The MCs have a range of mandated functions, compulsory and optional. In addition to\nthe provision of basic urban services and infrastructure, the MCs are also responsible for\ndrawing up master plans and site development plans, and a form of building control. MCs are,\nwith  some  exceptions,  short  of  skilled  staff,  and  do  not  have  adequate  local  revenue.\nMaintenance  of  urban  infrastructure  is  given  low  priority.  Urban  populations  have  little\nconfidence in local government, and are reluctant to pay existing taxes and charges. \n27. Elections for local councils were suspended in 1996, and towns have been administered\nby an administrator, appointed by the secretary, LGERD. The administrator is supported by\nofficers heading four main departments. The main MC departments relevant to urban services\n                                                          \n1 Definition of revenues categories before the abolition of octroi.", "Appendix 3, page 5\n41\nand infrastructure are (i) health department: responsible for sanitation (primarily solid waste\nmanagement (on average 78 percent of budget in project towns), drainage (21 percent), and\nvaccination (<1 percent)); (ii) water supply department: responsible for water supply, firefighting,\nand  street  watering;  (iii)  building  and  works  department:  responsible  for  roads,  general\nmunicipal works, building control, gardens, roadsides, and street lighting. Table A3 provides an\noverview of the allocation of responsibilities in urban planning and management for various\nsectors.  With  the  promulgation  of  the  Local  Government  Ordinance  in  August  2001,  the\nadministrative system is being changed, with the replacement of the administrator by a duly\nelected council representing all segments of the community. However, the existing infrastructure\nand  service  delivery  departments  will  remain,  with  changes  only  in  their  laws,  rules,  and\nregulations.\nTable A3: Allocation of Urban Planning and Management Responsibility\nSector Planning & Design Implementation / Operation &\nenforcement maintenance\nPreparation of PPHD; PPHD Not applicable\nstructure plans through LAAs\nDevelopment control PPHD PPHD Not applicable\nLand management PPHD PPHD Not applicable\nWater supply PHED PHED MC \u2013 Water supply\ndepartment\nDrainage MC \u2013 Health MC \u2013 Health MC \u2013 Health\nDepartment Department Department\nSewerage / sanitation MC \u2013 Health MC \u2013 Health MC \u2013 Health\nDepartment Department Department\nSolid waste MC \u2013 Health MC \u2013 Health MC \u2013 Health\nmanagement Department Department Department\nRoads & access:\n    National NHA NHA / CWD CWD\n    Local MC \u2013 Building & MC MC\nWorks Department\nElectricity WAPDA WAPDA WAPDA\nGas SNGPL SNGPL SNGPL\nFire MC MC MC\nCWD = Communication and Works Department, LAA = local area authorities, MC = municipal committees, NHA =\nNational Highways Authority, PHED = Public Health Engineering Department, PPHD = Physical Planning and\nHousing Department, SNGPL = Sui Northern Gas Pakistan Ltd., WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority.", "42\nAppendix 4, page 1\nEXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES IN URBAN TOWN\nA. Introduction\n1. Information about the quality and extent of the existing infrastructure and services in\nurban areas in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), and the seven phase 1 towns (the project\ntowns) in particular, is mainly drawn from Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance\n(TA),  namely  Urban  Infrastructure  Needs  Assessment,1  and  NWFP  Urban  Development\nProject.2 These studies concerned larger towns, thus the quality of service in the remaining\n(smaller, more remote) towns in NWFP will be less than described in this section. Responsibility\nfor  the  installation  or  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  covers  a\nnumber of provincial and local government agencies, as well as individual households. Table A4\nprovides a summary of quantitative data on the provision of infrastructure and services in the\nseven first-phase project towns.\nB. Infrastructure Sectors\n1. Water Supply\n2. The provision of piped water supply in the project towns at present ranges from 25-83\npercent of urban households. Takht Bhai and Swabi have only 8 percent coverage, due to the\nnoncommissioning of existing Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED) schemes.\nThe figures hide a wide range of quality differences, with hours of service per day as low as 1-3\nhours. Community taps (standpipes) are not common in NWFP, with a maximum of 6 percent\n(Charsadda, Mansehra) of the population dependent on such taps as their main source of\nwater.\n3. PHED is usually responsible for the major part of the design and construction of water\nsupply schemes, from source development, treatment, transmission, storage, and primary and\nsecondary distribution. Tertiary distribution and house connections are the responsibility of the\nlocal council. Upon completion, the scheme is handed over to the local councils for operation\nand maintenance. Billing is also the responsibility of local councils, although at rates set by\nPHED. Water meters have not yet been introduced in the project towns, but a Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau supported program of meter installation is under way elsewhere in urban NWFP.\nScheme designs usually follow a standard design, without a great deal of site-specific detail.\nCapacity of tubewells, reservoirs, and transmission mains follows standard designs.\n4. The fundamental problem with most piped water supply schemes is the high incidence\nof  leakage  (from  the  distribution  system),  wastage  (water  wasted  from  house  connections\nthrough faulty fittings, continuously open taps, and overflowing house reservoirs), and illegal\nconnections, leading to low system pressures and low water quality. Hours of operation are\noften severely limited (down to two or three hours per day), sometimes to reduce the high\nelectricity  costs  of  running  tubewells.  Discontinuous  supply  not  only  leads  to  low  system\npressure and thereby allowing entry of polluted water into the system, but also encourages\nconsumers to leave their taps open for when the water returns, leading to high wastage.\nAlternative supply to the piped supply usually consists of wells, for as much as 70 percent of\nhouseholds.  Most  wells  are  open  shallow  wells,  with  water  drawn  using  buckets.  Only\nCharsadda has a significant (20 percent) portion of the population using wells with handpumps.\n                                                          \n1 TA 1249-PAK: Urban Infrastructure Needs Assessment, for $600,000, approved on 19 December 1989.\n2 TA 2940-PAK: North-West Frontier Urban Development Project, for $950,000, approved on 12 December 1997.", "43\nAppendix 4, page 2\n2. Storm-Water Drainage\n5. The central problem of the degradation of the living environment in all towns is related to\nthe condition of the secondary and tertiary drainage system, which invariably also function for\ncarrying  fecal  waste.  All  storm-water  drains  are  contaminated  with  wastewater  and  are\neffectively open sewers.  Surveys (1993) show that the majority of drains in the project towns\nare lined, with roughly 25 percent in good condition, the remainder in average or poor condition.\nEven lined drains may not function adequately as they are seldom part of an interconnected\nnetwork, with adequate slope and profile. Maintenance of the drainage network is the MC's\nresponsibility. Performance on drainage maintenance varies, but is generally poor.\n3. Sewerage and Sanitation\n6. None  of  the  project  towns  have  piped  sewerage.  The  majority  of  households  are\nreported to have a septic tank, although the definition of a septic tank and simple cesspit with or\nwithout a soakpit is not clear. Survey data are therefore not consistent. Septic tanks in town\ncenters are old and not designed to present standards, i.e., with two or three chambers. None of\nthe local councils in any of the towns offer a septic tank desludging service. Thus, septic tanks\ndo not offer any form of treatment and the effluent quality is little better than that of raw sewage.\nA significant percentage of households (as high as 75 percent in some towns) still practice\nunacceptable human waste disposal methods (open air, bucket latrine, drain).\n4. Solid Waste\n7. Coverage for the collection and disposal of domestic and commercial solid waste in the\nproject towns ranges from 2-50 percent, typical coverage is around 25 percent. Collection can\nbe from individual households or from strategic locations such as neighborhood collection\npoints. These figures do not provide an indication of the adequacy of the disposal methods of\nthe  waste.  Final  disposal  is  generally  as  simple  as  dumping  in  low-lying  areas,  without\nsubsequent compaction or coverage. A major problem is the reluctance of the population to pay\ncharges for solid waste management services, which therefore remains seriously underfunded.\nThe volume of domestic waste generated is still relatively low, as a result of limited cash\neconomy in the smaller towns of NWFP. No specialized services exist for the disposal or\ntreatment of special waste such as hospital waste.\n5. Roads\n8. Major roads (national and provincial network) are maintained by Communication and\nWorks Department; the national roads by National Highways Authority. These are generally in\ngood condition, with widths of 7 meters. Local roads and access roads in urban areas, and\nassociated roadside drains, are the responsibility of the local council. The network is generally\nadequate in coverage, but poor in terms of road pavement quality and maintenance condition.\nMany  roads  are  still  unpaved,  without  adequate  drainage,  with  wastewater  over  the  road\nsurface. In old town centers, access is often via narrow lanes, not suitable for vehicular access.\n9. Traffic  problems  exist  in  most  town  centers,  largely  the  result  of  encroachment  of\ncommercial activities and uncontrolled parking. Another aspect of traffic is the wide disparity in\nvehicle speed and acceleration, with the still widespread use of human or animal traction.", "Table A4: Existing Infrastructure - Quantitative Data\nItem Unit Charsadda Hangu Haripur Mansehra Swabi Takht Bhai Timagara Province\n(46 towns)\n1.

Introduction\n1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has had limited involvement in the urban\nsector in Pakistan, with only four projects1 implemented and completed in North-West\nFrontier Province. In general, portfolio performance has been constrained by a number\nof generic macro and micro issues, including (i) legal and administrative issues relating\nto processing procedures and requirements, (ii) coordination and procedural issues, and\n(iii)  counterpart  fund  constraints  and  timely  release.  These  issues  resulted  in\nimplementation delays, with often negative financial and economic consequences, as\nwell as noncompliance with specific covenants, delays in consultant recruitment, minimal\nbeneficiary participation, poor operation and maintenance of completed facilities, and\nlimited institutional capacity. The following information provides specific lessons learned\non Pakistan urban projects.\n1. Karachi Urban Development Project\n2. Urban upgrading is complex in nature; a piecemeal approach to a few selected\nproblems is not an optimal solution. Urban upgrading should be designed from a plan\nthat integrates all aspects of urban infrastructure, and involves the participation of the\nultimate  beneficiaries:  The  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  project  must  be\npresent, and the financial framework must be in place to ensure long-term sustainability\nof the upgrading. The absence of any one of these elements will eliminate any chance\nfor project success.\n3. The  implementation  schedule  of  integrated  urban  development  projects  in\nmegacities like Karachi should be realistic and provide adequate time allowance for staff\ntraining  for  new  executing  agencies,  as  well  as  for  stoppages  from  unforeseen\nexigencies as peace and security problems.\n4. When a major outstanding problem is identified at appraisal, its resolution should\nbe a precondition for loan negotiations or at least for Board consideration.  Otherwise, it\ncould  lead  to  suspension  of  contract  awards,  which  inevitably  delays  project\nimplementation.\n5. The upgrading of sewerage treatment capacity needs to be synchronized with\ninflow of sewage available for treatment. Future financing of sewerage treatment plants\nshould ensure that properly connected sewers deliver an adequate level of sewage for\ntreatment upon completion.\n6. The main weakness of Karachi Urban Development Project was its design. This\nwas a direct result of the absence of project preparatory technical assistance (TA) early\nin  the  design  stage  of  this  complex  undertaking.  A  TA  would  have  identified  the\ninstitutional shortcomings of the executing agencies, provided estimates of willingness\nto pay of katchi abadi residents for leases, and provided appropriate designs for the\nphysical components of the project. Moreover, the results of such a TA would have\n                                                          \n1 Loan 793-PAK(SF):  Karachi Urban Development Project, for $55.2 million, approved on 14 October\n1986; Loan 1001-PAK(SF) and 1002-PAK: Karachi Sewerage Project, for $85.0 million, approved on 14\nDecember  1989;  and  Loan  1004-PAK(SF): Second Urban Development Project, for  $66.0  million,\napproved on 14 December 1989.", "52\nAppendix 8, page 2\nbeen available for discussion with the beneficiaries and other project stakeholders, thus\nincreasing project ownership during the design stage and the chances of its success.\n7. In December 1999, ADB conducted a project performance and audit report and\nconcluded that the project was unsuccessful. The project did not meet its original\nobjectives. The main identified weakness was in Project design. In addition, the long\nimplementation  delays  resulted  from  some  major  issues  that  should  have  been\nresolved prior to implementation, especially the financial solvency of the implementing\nagencies, which ultimately impacted on the sustainability of the project components.\n8. ADB's  project  administration  needs  to  be  strengthened,  particularly  for\nmonitoring financial and institutional aspects of a project. Loan covenants must be\nclosely monitored and enforced during implementation. Financial covenants need to be\nmore precise in their intentions. Weak and vague covenants tend to not be complied\nwith, resulting in little institutional reform. Moreover, financial covenants should be\nbased on a firm economic rationale. In the case of cost recovery, a clear relationship\nshould exist between the beneficiary of a service and the ultimate payer for the service.\nThis is not the case for solid waste disposal and sewage services. Because of the large\npositive externalities generated by these services, consideration should be given to\nfinancing these services out of general revenues.\n2. Karachi Sewerage Project\n9. The appraisal cost estimates for the Karachi Sewerage Project were based on\npreliminary designs and the Sindh government\u2019s standard unit rates, which led to cost\nescalation at tendering. This factor combined with the withholding of contract awards\nand nonavailability of part of the land for the Mauripur sewerage treatment plant led to a\nneed  to  reformulate  the  plant  layout  and  downsize  the  project.  This  experience\nunderlines the need to complete detailed design, use a reliable cost base, and obtain\npossession of key project sites before loan approval.\n10. When reformulation leads to significant scope reduction of a project, then the\ndimensions and the expected benefit stream of the revised project should be clearly\nindicated.  Absence of relevant information leads to difficulties in evaluating completion\nand measuring benefits.\n11. Beneficiary participation was limited during project implementation as it was not\nenvisaged at appraisal. This has led to some dissatisfaction among residents in one\nlocality served by the project. The Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) now\nrecognizes the importance of beneficiary involvement and has made serious efforts to\naccommodate beneficiary concerns in the Korangi Wastewater Management Project.\n12. Given the continued need for large investments to meet growing demands for\nwater and sewerage services in Karachi, KWSB has recognized the need for private\nsector participation in its activities. However, the process is tied up in a legal stalemate.\nKWSB needs to seek innovative solutions to this stalemate.", "53\nAppendix 8, page 3\n3.  Second Urban Development Project\n13. While this loan was closed on 31 December 1999, no project completion report\nhas been completed, and no formal assessment of project performance and associated\nproblems and issues relating to its implementation. However, a number of issues can be\nreadily identified from the project: (i) delays in land acquisition, (ii) minimal community\ninvolvement in the project, (iii) lack of ownership by the municipal and town committees\nin the project towns, (iv) limited financial contribution by the towns, (v) lack of counterpart\nbudget and untimely release, (vi) delay in consultant recruitment, (vii) frequent turnover\nof senior staff of the Project Management Unit, particularly at the position of director\ngeneral, and (vii) limited implementation of institutional reforms. While the Project can be\nconsidered a success in so far as it implemented significant capital works subprojects,\nconcern is noted at the capacity of the Project towns in operating and maintaining the\nassets, due to lack of budget and limited institutional capacity, as well as the financial\ncapacity of the Project towns to meet their debt service obligations under the various\nsubsidiary  loan  agreements.  The  design  of  the  Project  could  be  considered  over\nambitious considering the financial capacities of the participating towns.\nB.  Incorporating Lessons Learned to Project Design\n14. The lessons from the experience of the previous urban projects undertaken in\nPakistan have been incorporated into the project design to minimize recurrence of past\nproblems and issues. Particular emphasis has been given to assessing the financial and\ninstitutional capacities of the towns that are likely to participate in the Project. In addition,\nthe  proposed  subprojects  will  be  small  and  use  least-cost  design  solutions.  The\nmaximum amount of any subproject will be PRs50 million. Community participation will\nbe a focus. Without the participation of community-based organizations throughout the\nwhole  project  cycle,  long-term  sustainability  will  be  jeopardized.  Institutional\nstrengthening of the local government units, where the Project will be implemented, has\nbeen  given  priority,  particularly  to  financial  management  and  resource  mobilization.\nOwnership at the local government level must be a focal point of any urban project, and\nthis aspect has been carefully incorporated into the project design. The participating\ntowns will be required to nominated a core group of staff to be involved in project\nimplementation, with this core group forming the basis for a permanent urban unit within\nthe respective municipal committee.  In addition, an equity share of a minimum of 20\npercent for each subproject, and up to a maximum of 50 percent, depending on the MCs\nfinancial capability, will be required from each participating town. The Project will support\nthe Government\u2019s devolution initiatives and poverty reduction programs.", "Appendix 9, page 1\n54\nSUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF PREPARED SUBPROJECTS\nFOR THE URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT COMPONENT\n1. The urban infrastructure component consists of town-specific investment in one or more\ninfrastructure  subprojects.  The  infrastructure  subprojects  include  five  different  categories.\nSubproject appraisal studies were conducted for priority projects in the phase 1 project towns:\nCharsadda, Hangu, Haripur, Mansehra, Swabi, Takht Bhai, and Timargara. Details of these\nsubprojects are summarized in Table A9. Details of some of those subprojects have been\nrevised to reflect the commitment to basic needs and poverty reduction type subprojects, and to\nmatch both financial and institutional capabilities. \nA. Water Supply Subprojects\n2. While  statistics  on  percentage  of  the  population  connected  to  piped  water  supply\nsystems in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) towns may seem high, the performance of the\nschemes is often poor, with the main deficiencies including high leakage, low pressure, many\nillegal connections, and very limited hours of service. Strategies are aimed at reducing the\nincidence of unaccounted for water and illegal connections. Subprojects will be designed to\nimprove the quality of the service provided by existing schemes, and simultaneously increasing\nrevenues  through  a  combination  of  leak-detection  programs  and  the  conversion  of  illegal\nconnections to registered accounts. These measures should improve system pressures and the\nquality of the water as supplied. Where necessary, distribution systems will be extended to or\nimproved for poorly served areas. Priority will be given to servicing low-income areas. \n3. Consideration will be given to installing water meters in towns that have achieved a\nsecure  24-hour  supply  system,  and  that  can  demonstrate  the  technical  and  management\ndiscipline  required  to  run  a  meter-based  billing  system.  Lessons  will  be  learned  from  the\nexperience gained on the KfW-supported program of installing water meters now under way in\nBaffa, Kulachi, Lachi, Nawan Killi, Nawan Shaher, Thal, and 11 villages.\nB. Sewerage and Sanitation Subprojects\n4. The  construction  of  full  piped  sewerage  schemes  with  treatment  is  unlikely  to  be\naffordable  or  manageable  in  project  areas.  Targets  are  therefore  aimed  at  improving  the\ndisposal  of  human  waste  by  increasing  the  use  of  small  sewerage  schemes  with  local\ntreatment, encouraging the installation of adequately designed individual and communal septic\ntanks, and improving the maintenance of these tanks by introducing septic tank maintenance\nservices. Whether this service will be operated by the municipal committee (MC) or contracted\nout  to  a  private  operator  will  depend  on  the  capacity  of  the  respective  MC,  and  realistic\nprojections on the potential revenue resulting from service charges. The drainage component,\nas described in the following section, will also contribute to improving sanitary conditions as\nmost storm-water drains are currently contaminated with human waste.\nC. Drainage Subprojects\n5. The central problem of the degradation of the living environment in all towns is related to\nthe condition of the secondary and tertiary drainage systems, which invariably also carry fecal\nwaste.  Improvement  subprojects  are  aimed  at  routine  cleaning  and  rehabilitating  existing\nsystems, with particular emphasis on interconnecting isolated stretches of drainage channels\ninto a full network. Priority areas will be high-density, low-income areas, where interventions\nshould result in marked improvement of living conditions. Investments in new works will focus\non  establishing  drainage  networks  including  suitable  outfalls.  Drainage  subprojects  will  all", "55 Appendix 9, page 2\ninclude setting up maintenance procedures and systems, where necessary supported by the\nprovision of (manual) equipment for channel clearing.\nD. Solid Waste Management Subprojects\n6. The  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste  is  recognized  as  one  of  the  first\nresponsibilities of fledgling local authorities. However, current reluctance of the urban population\nin small towns in NWFP to pay all but minimal charges for a municipal waste collection service\nmeans that system improvements must be low cost. Waste volumes generated are relatively\nlow because of limited cash economies in up-country NWFP. Therefore, subprojects are aimed\nat minimal investment for collection systems, thereby requiring community support to minimize\nwaste and concentrate waste at neighborhood collection points. Emphasis will be placed on\nincreasing the cash contribution from commercial establishments, especially from wet markets.\nCollection equipment will be chosen to be affordable, maintainable, and appropriate to the\nparticular  urban  environment.  Disposal  management  will  include  equipment  and  operation\nsystems to compact and cover waste.\nE. Roads and Local Access Subprojects\n7. Subprojects in the road sector will seek to rehabilitate and improve the main urban road\nnetwork by resurfacing and widening within the existing right-of-way. Improved access to town\ncenters, and in particular to local neighborhoods, will enhance accessibility for all members of\nthe community as well as increase economic opportunities by attracting investment. Road\nsubprojects include improving associated roadside drains. Part of the subproject will involve\ntraffic management measures to improve circulation in congested town-center areas, through\njunction  improvement  and  introducing  restrictions  on  parking  and  roadside  vending.  Other\nsubprojects will include the extension of the existing road network system to low income areas,\nwhere present access is virtually nonexistent.", "Appendix 9, page 3\n56\nTable A9: Summary of Subprojects Prepared for Phase 1 Project Towns\nName/Subproject Present Condition Rationale Scope\nCharsadda\nSolid Waste \u2022  Only 12-16 percent of Subproject should \u2022  Pilot composting scheme:\nManagement waste collected increase the fraction of civil works, equipment\n\u2022  Most waste of domestic and commercial \u2022  Community self-help\ndomestic nature waste collected from the collection and disposal:\n\u2022  Inadequate collection urban area, and dispose of civil works, small\nand disposal it in a more equipment\nequipment environmentally \u2022  Sanitary landfill sites:\n\u2022  Uncontrolled dumping acceptable manner at development of disposal\nimproved landfill site site and basic operational\nequipment\n\u2022  Improved collection,\ntransport, and disposal:\nprovision of basic\nequipment\nSwabi\nRoad Improvement \u2022  Three provincial \u2022  Improvement to main \u2022  Resurfacing, upgrading\nroads functioning as urban road networks \u2022  Road widening\narterial roads to \u2022  Improved traffic \u2022  Improved roadside drains\nSwabi town center management \u2022  Improved traffic\n\u2022  Mixture of fast and management\nslow-moving vehicles\n\u2022  All commercial\nactivities along main\nroads; no parking\nspace; on road\nloading/unloading\n\u2022  All combined leading\nto frequent gridlock\nsituation\nMansehra\nWater Supply on \u2022  System suffering \u2022  Improved quality of \u2022  Introduction of 5,500\nGravity Flow from high losses supply and quality of water meters\n\u2022  Polluted surface water \u2022  Leak detection and repair\nwater source \u2022  Increased fraction of scheme: reduce from 55\n\u2022  High cost for pumped and treated percent to 30 percent\nelectricity for water actually \u2022  Management assistance:\ndeepwell pumps delivered and sold to prepare operation\nconsumer manual, training,\nintroduction of billing and\npayment systems, set-up\nmanagement information\nsystem", "57\nAppendix 9, page 4\nName/Subproject Present Condition Rationale Scope\nSanitation \u2022  No piped sewerage \u2022  Sanitation \u2022  (Re)construction of drains\nsystem improvements should (40 hectares)\n\u2022  High incidence of improve functioning of \u2022  (Re)construction of septic\nopen drains carrying existing facilities by tanks (18 communal)\nraw sewage the providing \u2022  Development of sludge\nmaintenance drying site with\nequipment; and by associated infrastructure\nimproving the flow of \u2022  Provision of desludging\nthe existing network and maintenance\nequipment (handtools,\netc.)\nTakht Bhai\nRailway Crossing \u2022  Narrow crossing \u2022  A new crossing will \u2022  Relocation of \nleading to congestion improve traffic flow, encroaching commercial\nthroughout the day reduce economic establishments to be\n\u2022  Reduced traffic losses caused by completed before\ncapacity because of congestion, and subproject processing\nencroachment reduce nuisance for \u2022  Civil works on railway\n\u2022  Unsafe conditions for residents and road (removal and clearing\npedestrians users ballast), and on roads\n\u2022  Present crossing ill-\ndesigned and\ndangerous\n\u2022  Train three times per\nweek\nSewerage and \u2022  No piped sewerage \u2022  Subproject will provide \u2022  Construction of\nDrainage system transport and interceptor sewer\n\u2022  High incidence of treatment of \u2022  Construction of primary\nunsanitary methods wastewater.  sedimentation ponds\nof disposal of human Secondary and tertiary \u2022  Provision of basic\nwaste (pit latrine, drains will be improved operational and\nbucket systems, through the PHED- maintenance equipment\ndrain, open space) initiated rehabilitation\n\u2022  PHED to rehabilitate scheme.

The proceeds of the loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be onlent by the\nGovernment of Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Finance (MOF) to the Department of Finance (DOF) within\nthe Planning and Development Department of the North-West Frontier Province government on\nthe same terms and conditions applicable to ADB\u2019s loan to the Government, with a term of 32\nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1 percent per annum\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The Government will assume the\nforeign exchange risk. In addition, the NWFP Government will provide $250,000, in foreign\ncurrency,  to  finance  the  cost  of  the  international  municipal  financial  management  advisor\nposition of 13 person-months, as included under the Institutional Development Component.\n2. All disbursements for subprojects will be made by the project coordination unit upon\nendorsement of pertinent project implementation teams and municipal committees (MCs). MCs\nwill be required to borrow an amount equal to a minimum of 20 percent of the subproject cost,\nand up to 50 percent depending on the MCs financial capacity. The MCs will sign subloan\nagreements with DOF for the loan portion of the subproject cost, using standard terms and\nconditions established by DOF, including an interest rate of 7 percent and repayment period of\n15 years, and a three-year grace period during which interest payments only will be payable. No\ninterest will accrue on subloans during the construction of subprojects because of the small\nscale of the loans and the short implementation period. Subject to the demand for loans in the\nfuture, DOF may retain principal repayments made by the MCs for relending subject to its\nobligations to repay funds to MOF to enable MOF to meet the Government\u2019s obligations to ADB.\n3. The Government will seek the approval of ADB for any significant change to the terms\nand conditions of the loan agreement between DOF and MOF.

NGOs committed to the development of (urban) CBOs,\n(urban) local government, and issues of devolution and decentralization will be recruited in\naccordance with Planning Environment and Development Department (PEDD) guidelines on the\nrecruitment of NGOs, by a committee comprising members from Finance, PEDD, LGERD, and\nthe (PMU), through direct invitation or following public notification. The NGOs will enter into an\nagreement with the Government on the form and content of the provision of the services of\nteams of SOs, to be based in each project town.\n10. A team of SOs will consist of one female and one male SO.  The team will work in the\nproject town for the duration of the project, from the point of confirmed selection of the town,\nuntil completion of the implementation of subproject components, expected to be three years.\nPreferably, the team will be recruited from the relevant district (i) to ensure cultural affinity and\nlanguage compatibility with the communities, and (ii) to avoid logistical problems of transport\nand accommodation.  SOs are likely to operate from the offices of the MC.\n11. Upon appointment by the PCU, the NGOs will select teams of SOs for the phase 1 project\ntowns.  The NGO will be responsible for the selection process, according to outline job descriptions\nand qualification requirements as specified by the PCU.  Before the start of their involvement,\ncandidate SOs will be trained at the provincial level under guidance of the senior community\ndevelopment adviser (CDA), who has overall responsibility for the planning and implementation of\nthe community development process. The training will focus on clarifying the role of the SOs in the\nprocess, nature, and objectives of the overall Project; some fundamentals on urban services and\ninfrastructure; and the functioning and organization of (urban) local government and the municipal\ncommittee in particular. Experience can be drawn from other successful community-based projects\nin NWFP on appropriate forms of organizing and training large groups of SOs.", "65\nAppendix 12, page 5\n12. During the course of the Project, senior SOs will be selected based on experience and\norganizational aptitude to take on a wider role in administration, training, and dissemination of\ncollective experience. During the course of the Project, some organizational structure will evolve\nwithin the group of SOs, with more experienced SOs assuming a regional management role, and\nliaison for practical purposes between town teams and the central PCU.\n13. Tasks for the SOs include the following:\n(i)  Receive training and orientation at the PCU on the project framework and\nthe overall developmental objectives;\n(ii)  Became familiar with available relevant socioeconomic data from earlier\nstudies and surveys on project town: social profile, priorities on service\nprovision, records on fee payments (data to be provided by the PCU);\n(iii)  Map population groups in project town assigned; inventory social groups\nand existing CBOs; report on functioning of existing CBOs, record nature,\npurpose, composition, and method of operation;\n(iv)  Gain  insight  on  the  operation  of  the  MC;  plan,  organize,  and  conduct\nexploratory  meetings  with  key  municipal  staff,  explaining  objectives  of\ninvolvement in the development program;\n(v)  Maintain close coordination with the PIT, in particular with the community\nliaison  officer  (CLO)  within  the  team,  and  keep  informed  on  planning\nprocess; train the CLO, jointly define role and method of operation;\n(vi)  Through interviews and from observation, assess the level, purpose, and\nmechanism of current interaction between MC and the population, whether\nas individuals, representative organizations, or lobby groups;\n(vii)  Plan, prepare, and conduct a series of joint meetings or workshops between\nCBOs (representatives) and MC staff, to discuss mutual expectations and\npriorities  on  respective  roles  in  town  management,  and  on  means  to\nimprove constructive communication and collaboration; discuss and identify\npotential roles of communities in planning and delivering urban services and\ninfrastructure; achieve joint understanding on common objectives; explore\nand identify common benefits;\n(viii)  Plan, prepare, and conduct meetings, workshops, and training seminars for\nMC  staff  at  all  levels,  to  discuss  actual  and  assigned  role  and\nresponsibilities  of  local  government  in  service  delivery  and  improve\nperformance;\n(ix)  Plan,  organize,  and  deliver  public  awareness  campaigns  for  specific\nsubprojects; improve awareness among communities on impact of their\nliving  environment  and  family  health;  explain  reason  for  and  benefit  of\ncertain sanitation improvements and need for charges to maintain certain\nservices; and\n(x)  Act as liaison and catalyst between communities and other sources of\nsupport  in  other  sectors,  such  as  health,  education,  and  employment\ngeneration;  and  provide  guidance  on  how  to  access  other  support\nprograms.\n14. Estimates for the input of SOs (Table A12.4) are based on (i) a team of one female and\none male SO per project town; (ii) for the entire period of the project, including initial planning,\nsubproject  selection  and  appraisal,  bid  preparation  and  evaluation,  and  implementation  of\nsubprojects, estimated as approximately three year; and (iii) for a total of 17 project towns.\nActual inputs per town are bound to vary, as may be total number of participating towns.", "66\nAppendix 12, page 6\n15.

The broad range of economic benefits that are expected to result from subprojects is\noutlined in Table A14.1. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of\nreturn (FIRRs), as appropriate, were prepared for representative subprojects in accordance with\nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of\nUrban Development Sector Projects. EIRRs were prepared for road and drainage subprojects\n(Table A14.2), and FIRRs for solid waste disposal and water supply subprojects (Table A14.3).\n2. Financial evaluations were based on current fees paid by consumers and indications of\nwillingness to pay for improved services, determined on the basis of a socioeconomic survey of\nhouseholds. However, the surveys generally indicated a low willingness to pay, apparently\nreflecting doubts by potential beneficiaries about the capacity of government to deliver effective\nprojects and an underestimation of the impact of projects on their lives. Economic evaluations\nwere based on the domestic price numeraire, and exclude taxes (at a rate of 10 percent) and\nother market distortions (with a standard conversion factor of 0.85). A shadow exchange rate\nfactor was applied to tradable components of the project costs. Projects were assessed over a\n20-year evaluation period, with allowance made for the residual value of assets at the end of the\nevaluation period. The evaluations were undertaken using constant 1999 prices, and took into\naccount incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The minimum acceptable EIRR\nshould be 12 percent, and FIRRs for subprojects should exceed the real weighted average cost\nof  capital,  which  is  estimated  at  2.5  percent.  However,  the  community  development  and\nparticipation  component  of  the  Project  is  designed  to  increase  public  understanding  and\nownership of subprojects, and thus improve beneficiary perception of the effective delivery of\nservices and understanding of the benefits that will result. The higher willingness to pay that\nshould result will increase the value of the subprojects, which are conservatively based on\ncurrent willingness to pay.\nA. Drainage and Sanitation\n3. Storm-water drainage subprojects involve rehabilitating and upgrading existing drains,\nand some development of new drains, to establish an interconnected network with suitable\noutflow arrangements. The subprojects will reduce the incidence of inundation, which is severe\nin some towns with flat terrain, and reduce the incidence of erosion in towns where the terrain\nleads to rapid runoff of storm water. The former will result in reduced damage to property,\nimproved quality of life, and health benefits. These benefits will be reflected, to some extent, in\nincreased property values following implementation of the subprojects. Drainage subprojects\nwill reduce property damage, social dislocation and health impacts, and economic dislocation.\nThe value of such benefits will often be difficult to explicitly identify and value, but willingness by\nbeneficiaries to pay for the benefits will normally provide an indication of their value. It is\nprobable that some of the social benefits from reduced flooding and environmental benefits from\nreduced erosion may not be fully reflected through indications of willingness to pay. This may\nwarrant acceptance of subprojects that have lower EIRRs but where unquantifiable social and\nenvironmental benefits are expected to be major benefits. No pure drainage subprojects have\nbeen prepared for the initial project towns, and hence no evaluation has been undertaken.\n4. Sanitation improvements will generally involve the provision of individual and communal\nseptic tanks, which, in conjunction with drainage subprojects, will result in diversion of outflows\nfrom septic tanks and household wastewater away from residential areas and for outflow to\noccur in suitable locations. The improved sanitary conditions that will result will provide health", "69\nAppendix 14, page 2\nbenefits and savings in medical expenditure. Socioeconomic surveys for the project towns\nindicate only limited current willingness by the community to pay for improved services, at about\nPRs11 per household per month for improved drainage and sanitation. This occurs despite\ncurrent high levels of morbidity due to waterborne diseases, with 63 percent of households in\nthe initial project towns reporting illness in the household in the month before the survey. The\nprincipal illnesses were malaria (26 percent), diarrhea (23 percent), and typhoid (14 percent), all\nof which are related to poor water management.\n5. A financial evaluation was prepared for the component of a subproject in Takht Bai,\nwhich would provide treatment of wastewater and removal via improved secondary and tertiary\ndrains, which will reduce exposure of residents in the urban area to contaminated wastewater.\nBased on the currently expressed willingness to pay, the FIRR for the subproject is estimated at\n6.1 percent (Table A14.2). This FIRR would increase substantially if community perceptions of\nthe merits of the subproject were improved and the willingness to pay increased accordingly.\nB. Solid Waste Disposal\n6. Solid waste subprojects involve development of new disposal sites, procurement of units\nfor the collection of solid waste, and improved treatment of solid waste. The subprojects have\nenvironmental and health benefits that warrant acceptance of a hurdle rate that is less than the\nopportunity cost of capital associated with the Project. Socioeconomic surveys for the project\ntowns indicate a negligible current willingness by the community to pay for improved services.\n7. A financial evaluation was prepared for a subproject to develop an improved system of\nself-help collection and disposal of solid waste in Charsadda through community mobilization,\nthe  purchase  of  relevant  collection  and  disposal  equipment,  and  development  of  a  waste\ndisposal site. Socioeconomic surveys for the project towns indicate a low current willingness by\nthe  community  to  pay  for  improved  urban  services,  but  the  community  development  and\nparticipation component of the Project are expected to improve beneficiary perception of the\neffective delivery of waste collection services and understanding of the benefits that will result.\nThe combination of a current willingness to pay of PRs11 per household per month and a\nreduction in the cost of maintaining drains because of the reduced quantity of waste disposed of\nin drains results in an FIRR for the subproject of 7.1 percent (Table A14.3). This FIRR would\nincrease substantially if community perceptions of the merits of the subproject were improved\nand the willingness to pay increased accordingly.\nC. Water Supply\n8. Water  supply  subprojects  will  generally  involve  rehabilitation  of  and  extensions  to\nexisting systems to improve the quantity and quality of water supply, and reduced technical and\nadministrative  losses.  Reductions  in  physical  losses  of  water  and  wasted  water  will  allow\nadditional water to be supplied to new consumers without the need to increase the supply of\nraw water. A financial evaluation was prepared for a water supply subproject in Hangu to reduce\nphysical water leakage, improve the water distribution system, and introduce water meters. The\nbenefits of the subproject will be to release current water that can be sold to new customers.\nBased on projected water tariffs (PRs85 per household per month, which is equal to 2 percent\nof average 25th percentile household income of PRs4,500 per household per month, with a 5\npercent per annum real increase in the water tariff), the FIRR for the subproject is estimated to\nbe 10.6 percent (Table A14.3).", "Appendix 14, page 3\n70\nD. Roads\n9. Road improvements will include improvements to the surface and alignment of existing\nroads, widening of existing roads, and to a lesser extent, construction of new streets. Benefits\ninclude savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) and personal travel time (business purposes),\nand increased accessibility for development. The last of these benefits is reflected in higher land\nvalues, but is excluded because of the risk of double-counting the benefits, and the difficulty of\naccurately depicting increases in land value that can be attributed to improved accessibility.\nSavings in VOCs resulting from road improvements take into account the effect of higher travel\nspeed and reduced road roughness on VOCs as derived by the Ministry of Communications.\nSavings in personal travel time were based on trips for work purposes only. Incremental O&M\ncosts were estimated at 0.4 percent of the capital cost of subprojects, plus an allowance of 20\npercent  of  the  capital  cost  every  seven  years  for  resurfacing.  The  economic  life  of  road\nimprovement subprojects is 20 years.\n10. An economic evaluation was prepared for the subproject to improve an at-grade railway\ncrossing in Takht Bai to improve traffic movement and reduce delays. The crossing is heavily\nused, and the improvement results in an EIRR of 17 percent (Table A14.2). Savings in VOCs\naccount for 40 percent of the benefits; and savings in personal travel time account for the\nremaining benefits. Overall, the road subprojects in the central areas of towns are expected to\nhave high EIRRs because of the concentration of traffic in those areas and the poor quality of\nexisting roads. Rehabilitation of existing roads will also generally have higher EIRRs because of\nthe considerable savings in travel time and, in particular VOCs, which can result from relatively\nmodest expenditure. New roads to developing areas at the periphery of towns are likely to have\nlower EIRRs, but may be warranted in some circumstances.\nTable A14.1:  Summary of Economic Benefits of Subprojects\nSolid Water Roads Drainage Sanitation\nBenefit Waste Supply\nHealth & Environment\n Reduced waterborne diseases High High High Medium\n Reduced fly/mosquito breeding High High High High\n Decreased infant mortality Medium Medium Medium\n Less sick time off from work Medium Medium Medium Medium\n Improved school attendance Medium Medium Medium Medium\n Savings in medical costs Medium Medium Medium Medium Medium\n Improved hygiene standards High High High High\n Pollution abatement High High Medium High High\n Fewer road accidents High\nInfrastructure and Financial\n Expanded land use and availability Low Medium High\n Increased land/property values Low High High High\n Increased MC revenue Medium High Medium Medium\n Reduced MC O&M costs High Medium Low Medium\n Reduced damage to crops/livestock Low High\n Reduced road maintenance costs High High\n Reduced vehicle operating costs High Medium", "Appendix 14, page 4\n71\nSolid Water Roads Drainage Sanitation\nBenefit Waste Supply\n Reduced travel time High High\n Improved accessibility of markets High Medium\nSocioeconomic Development\n Improved municipal service levels High High High High\n Improved trade and business High High High High High\n Employment impacts Medium High Medium\n Reduced household maintenance High Medium Low Medium Medium\n Improved living standards High High High High High\n Greater productivity of MC staff High High High High\nMC = municipal committees, O&M = operation and maintenance.\nTable A14.2:  Summary of Economic Evaluations\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return  (%)\nComponent/Location Base Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5\nCase (Capital (Benefit (Delayed (1+2) (1+2+3)\nCost \u201310%) Benefits\n+10%) 1 year)\nRoad Improvement, Takht Bai 17.3 15.7 15.3 14.2 13.9 12.6\nSanitation and Drainage Rehabilitation, Takht 6.1 5.4 5.2 4.6 4.6 4.1\nBai\nTable A14.3:  Summary of Financial Evaluations\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%)\nComponent/Location Base Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5\nCase (Capital (Benefit (Delayed (1+2) (1+2+3)\nCost \u201310%) Benefits\n+10%) 1 year)\nSolid Waste Improvement, Charsadda 7.1 6.0 5.6 5.4 4.6 4.1\nWater Supply, Hangu 10.6 9.5 9.2 8.7 8.2 7.5", "72\nAppendix 15, page 1\nSOCIAL ASPECTS AND AFFORDABILITY\nA. Introduction\n1. Social  development  concerns,  including  gender,  poverty,  and  community\nparticipation, have been incorporated into all stages of project preparation. Gender,\npoverty, and public welfare issues were the bases of approaches used in socioeconomic\nand urban data collection during the project preparatory technical assistance, particularly\nin the design of the household perception survey and the survey of current services and\nsocial and physical infrastructure in the initial project towns, and in the sector and\nsubsector assessments. Social and economic issues influenced the selection and design\nof the urban infrastructure, community development, and participation components of the\nProject. The involvement of the public in subprojects will complement and reinforce the\nimmediate  economic  and  health  benefits  associated  with  water  supply,  drainage,\nsanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  components  of  the  Project  by  ensuring\nsustainability and ownership.\nB. Socioeconomic Profile of Urban Households\n2. The average household size in the initial project towns is 7.7, with an average of\n1.2 families per household.\n3. Average household monthly income is estimated to be PRs9,800, with the 25th\npercentile and medium income at PRs4,400 and PRs7,100 respectively (Table A15.1),\nindicating a substantial unequal distribution of income in the community. About two thirds\nof income for both average and 25th percentile income households is spent on food,\nclothing,  rent,  electricity,  fuel,  and  water,  with  only  0.4  percent  of  income  for  both\ncategories of household spent on water. The amount spent on water is only 4 percent of\nthat spent on electricity and fuel.\n4. Household ownership is high, at 86 percent of households, with an average of\none fifth of houses being katcha (permanent mud-formed structures). Flooding is a\nproblem for many, with 17 percent of households reporting that floodwater enters their\nhomes. The supply of services to households includes a low 26 percent for solid waste\ncollection, 37 percent have piped water supply, and 40 percent have a septic tank. The\ncurrent moderate residential density away from town centers alleviates the difficulties of\nthese service levels. However, high average population growth of 3.6 percent per annum\nwill increase the need for higher levels of service in the future.\nC. Gender\n5. The ratio of women in urban households in the initial project towns is low in\ncomparison with demographic norms, with an average of only 93 women for every 100\nmen in urban households. Women also remain almost exclusively tied to household\nactivities, wives make up only 3 percent of employed household members, compared\nwith husbands at 86 percent, children at 8 percent, and other household members, 3\npercent.\n6. Women in Pakistan bear primary responsibility for management of the domestic\nenvironment,  including  water  collection  and  solid  waste  disposal.  Children  also\nparticipate significantly in these activities. Women will therefore benefit directly from", "73\nAppendix 15, page 2\nproject activities that improve sanitary conditions in the immediate surrounding area of\nhomes (improved removal of wastewater and solid waste collection). Women will also\nbenefit from drainage projects that reduce the incidence of flooding of houses and the\ndamage and dislocation that results.\nD. Affordability to Beneficiaries\n7. A review of the components and subcomponents included in the Project reveals\nthat the direct and indirect repayment burdens imposed on beneficiaries are generally\naffordable to all benefiting social and income groups. The affordability implications for\nparticular subcomponents are discussed in the following subsections.\n1. Immovable Property Tax\n8. Current collection of the immovable property tax varies considerably between the\ninitial project towns, ranging from PRs0 to PRs41 per capita per annum, equal to a\nmaximum of 0.03 percent of average household income and 0.08 percent of first quartile\nincome households, and generally a markedly lower share for most urban residents.\nSubstantial increases in revenue from the immovable property tax are expected only in\ntowns where rates are low at present. Hence, the need to increase resource mobilization\nthrough  the  immovable  property  tax  should  not  generally  present  a  burden  to\ncommunities. The immovable property tax is mildly progressive because very small\nallotments (of less than approximately 38 square meters) pay no tax, although this effect\nis diminished by a relatively higher rate of tax for small to medium-size allotments (5-10\nmarla) than for larger properties. The Tax could be made more progressive by ensuring\nthat the unit tax rate rises with property size.\n2. Water, Drainage, Sanitation, and Solid Waste Charges\n9. Surveys indicate only limited current willingness by the community to pay for\nimproved services (e.g., about PRs11 per household per month for improved drainage\nand  sanitation  services,  and  PRs26  per  household  per  month  for  improved  water\nsupply). This occurs despite current high levels of morbidity due to waterborne diseases,\nwith  63  percent  of  households  in  the  initial  project  towns  reporting  illness  in  the\nhousehold in the month before the survey. The principal illnesses were malaria (26\npercent), diarrhea (23 percent), and typhoid (14 percent). Proposed subprojects will\ncontribute to a reduction in these water-related illnesses by improving the removal of\nwastewater and solid waste, and reducing the unnecessary presence of still water. The\ncommunity  development  and  participation  component  of  the  Project  is  designed  to\nincrease  public  understanding  and  ownership  of  subprojects,  and  thus  improve\nbeneficiary perception of the effective delivery of services and understanding of the\nbenefits that will result.\n10. A proposed increase in the cost of water, on an incremental basis over the first\ntwo years of the project implementation, of PRs85 per household per month, will result in\na  tariff  that  is  equal  to  2  percent  of  average  25th  percentile  household  income  of\nPRs4,400 per household per month, which indicates that continuing real increases in\nwater tariffs (which will be offset to some extent by rising household income) can occur,\nwhile still ensuring adequate access by low income households to water. Similarly,\ncharges for removal of solid waste and for drainage and sanitation improvements should\nbe affordable to beneficiary communities."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011022142427", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "rsa", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R186-01RRP.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011114173645+08'00'"}}
