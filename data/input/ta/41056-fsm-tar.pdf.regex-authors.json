The Government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to support national and state \ngovernments  in  strengthening  their  execution  of  performance-based  budgeting  to  facilitate \nimplementation  of  priority  actions  identified  in  the  Strategic  Development  Plan  2004\u20132023 \n(SDP). The need to improve budget management and plan implementation within the broader \ncontext of improved economic management has been recognized domestically1 as well as in \nexternal assessments of the FSM by ADB, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and United \nStates Government Accountability Office (US GAO).2  \n \n2.  The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited the FSM during 18 April\u20133 May 2007 to assess the \nrelevance and scope of this TA.3 Discussions were held with representatives of the national \nGovernment  and  three  state  governments  and  other  stakeholders.  An  understanding  was \nreached on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The FSM has received high levels of external assistance since independence in 1986, \npredominantly from the US under the Compact of Free Association. Yet the economy remains \nheavily dependent on the public sector (overall public expenditure is equivalent to around 60% \nof gross domestic product [GDP]), with limited private sector activity and a narrow export base. \nOn a per capita basis, GDP was estimated at $1,952 in fiscal year (FY) 2006. Growth averaged \nonly 1.3% between 1987 and 2003 (the period of the first Compact), the economy contracted by \nan estimated 0.7% in 2006, and growth of just 1.0\u20131.5%4 is expected in 2007 and 2008. Aid \nflows, in combination with a lack of capacity, have contributed to some poor habits going \nunchecked\u2014limited financial responsibility, limited monitoring of performance, reliance on the \npublic sector, substitution of aid for raising domestic revenues, and limited demand for policy \nchange.  \n \n4.  External  assessments  of  the  FSM  by  ADB,  IMF,  and  US  GAO  have  all  identified \nunsustainable fiscal management and failure to implement key development priorities as major \nimpediments  to  achieving  self-sustaining  economic  growth.  The  need  to  improve  budget \nmanagement  and  strategic  plan  implementation  within  the  broader  context  of  improved \neconomic  management  has  also  been  recognized  domestically,  most  recently  in  national \nGovernment assessments of Chuuk and Kosrae states and also in the FSM report to the \nConsultative Group Meeting (November 2006).5   \n \n5.  There are increasing pressures to redress the situation. The amended Compact (which \ncame into effect in FY2004) goes some way to addressing issues of financial responsibility and \n                                                 \n1  FSM report to the Consultative Group Meeting, November 2006.  \n2  ADB. 2006. Federated States of Micronesia 2005 Economic Report. Manila; US GAO. 2006. Compacts of Free \nAssociation Development Prospects Remain Limited for Micronesia and Marshall Islands. Report to Congressional \nCommittees, GAO-06-590. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 25 April 2007. \n4  ADB. 2007. Asian Development Outlook 2007. Manila. \n5  This reported that \u201cRecent fiscal deficits have led to a substantial drawdown in reserves so that only Yap has a \nreasonable level of unrestricted financial reserves. In Chuuk, there are no reserves and government arrears have \nclimbed to over 40% of GDP. There are also no reserves in Kosrae and Pohnpei and the National Government\u2019s \nreserves are less than 2% of GDP.\u201d  \n ", "2   \nperformance monitoring by requiring quarterly financial and performance reports as well as \nproviding the US with the ability to withhold or suspend funds. The FSM is feeling this pressure \nas  the  US  has  now  withheld  funds  every  year  since  FY2004.  Furthermore,  the  amended \nCompact itself creates substantial fiscal adjustment challenges by placing pressure on recurrent \noperations expenditures that in the past the Compact funded, but that in the future must be \neither cut or funded from local revenues. In the longer term, the lack of full indexation of the \nannual Compact sector grants and the annual decrement of $800,000 (which is directed to the \nTrust  Fund)  will  require  continuous  fiscal  adjustment.  Finally,  the  2023  scheduled  end  to \nCompact funding is directing greater attention to the issue of self-sufficiency.  \n \n6.  The Government recognized these issues prior to the implementation of Compact II and \nin preparation developed the SDP with the support of ADB.6 The SDP was designed to identify \npriority activities essential to generate the growth required to meet the national goal of self-\nsustainability  by  2023.  The  broad  policy  priorities  were  recognized  as,  and  remain,  fiscal \nadjustment through expenditure cuts and tax reforms, and structural reforms to support private \nsector development.  \n \n7.  However, progress in implementing the SDP has been very slow. Responsibilities for \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  coordination  are  divided  among  several  central  agencies  and \ncoordination is not effective. At the state level, the varying degrees of knowledge and ownership \nof the SDP suggest a need to identify a small number of priority actions that can be achieved in \nthe short term and can be regularly revisited and updated, thus creating a stepping-stone path \nto reaching SDP goals. There have been initial efforts at integrating strategic priorities into \nbudget  processes,  which  is  essential  to  ensure  the  funding  of  priority  activities,  but  full \nintegration and performance reporting need further work. Slow SDP implementation has been \npartly due to capacity limitations and the loose federation of government that has made it \ndifficult to forge a consensus for reform and to coordinate policies.  \n \n8.  Progress  in  implementing  tax  reforms,  led  by  the  Department  of  Finance  and \nAdministration's taxation reform project manager, signals strengthened willingness to tackle \ndifficult economic management issues. When fully implemented, the proposed reforms will \nimpact on budget positions and the ability of the FSM to implement the SDP. Yet tax reform \nalone will not be sufficient to manage fiscal pressures. Attention also needs to be paid to \nensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of budget expenditure, particularly in the period before \nFY2009 when the tax reform will be fully implemented. While a 22% decrease in public sector \nemployment and a 28% decline in the wage bill for government were achieved as part of the \nADB-supported  Public  Sector  Reform  Project,7  since  then  government  employment  and \nexpenditure have crept back to levels equivalent to, or above, prereform levels. This assistance \nthus complements taxation reform and should be coordinated closely with taxation reform.  \n \n9.  At  least  two  states  are  currently  facing  financial  difficulties.  National  Government \nassessments of the states of Chuuk and Kosrae have found a range of problems in the areas of \nrevenue collection, expenditure management, and procurement, which have resulted in high \nlevels  of  debt  and  ongoing  and  unsustainable  budget  deficits.  In  March  2007,  Congress \nappropriated over $1.4 million for Kosrae to meet immediate needs.  \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003.

This TA is strategically important in that it clearly supports the FSM Country Strategy \nand Program Update 2006\u20132007 key priority of good governance (which includes promotion of \neffective  development  processes  and  support  for  long-term  capacity-building  efforts). \nImportantly,  it  links  two  areas  where  ADB  has  previously  provided  support\u2013\u2013planning  and \nfinancial management8\u2013\u2013to facilitate FSM use of performance information in the budget for \nresults-based decision making and strategic development planning. This TA directly addresses \nthe problematic issues of governance and capacity in financing and implementing the SDP by \ndeveloping  long-run  adjustment/sustainable  transition  plans,  strengthening  capacity  in \nperformance  budgeting,  and  interlinking  the  budgeting  and  planning  processes.  The  TA \ncomplements  ongoing  US  federal  assistance  initially  targeted  at  developing  performance \nindicators for the six Compact sectors for the FY2008 budget and reporting on them. Importantly, \nthis TA supports FSM\u2019s capacity to utilize performance information for sound decision making \nthrough  developing  an  awareness  and  understanding  of  performance  budgeting  within  the \nNational Congress and state legislatures as well as within departments. Activities will take place \nwithin a broader framework of implementing priority development needs to move toward a \nposition of sustainable economic development in the long term.  \n \n11.  This TA builds on lessons of earlier assistance to the FSM in related areas\u2015in particular, \nthat adequate time needs to be allowed to build the capacity to ensure sustainability of activities. \nCompletion reports for the initial TAs in budget management considered the TAs to have \nprovided a sound basis for budgeting in the FSM, although the TAs had not created integration \ninto planning processes nor generated a high level of political interest in strengthened budgeting, \nwhich would lift the use of performance budgeting to the next level. These are of particular focus \nin this TA.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be to support the implementation of the SDP and its goal of \neconomic self-sufficiency. The TA seeks to achieve the outcome of interlinked budget and \nplanning processes supporting sustainable economic development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will support assistance in the interrelated areas of public financial management \nand national planning and will build on and complement earlier and ongoing related assistance. \nTo support the achievement of the impact and outcome described above, the TA will be in two \n                                                 \n8  ADB  provided  broad  support  for  economic  policy  reform  through  ADB.  2001.

The \nimplementation of phase 2 at the national and state levels will depend on the achievement of \nspecific  short-term  benchmarks  identified  in  the  national  and  state  long-run \nadjustment/sustainable transition plans developed in phase 1.  \n \n14.  Phase 1 will have as its outputs national and state transition plans and a governance \narrangement to oversee the TA. Activities in this phase will comprise (i) development of national \nand state long-run adjustment/sustainable transition plans to move to a sustainable balance of \ngovernment revenue and expenditure and cut fiscal deficits; and (ii) creation/identification of \nsteering committees at national and state levels to oversee the implementation of the TA and to \nsustain the processes developed beyond the implementation period of the TA. TA steering \ncommittees  will  be  created  by  each  government  and  will  comprise  relevant  public  sector \nrepresentatives. The committees will also be responsible for monitoring and coordinating related \nfunding agency assistance.  \n \n15.  The adjustment/sustainable transition plans developed in phase 1 will each include a \nsmall number of specific financial and/or macroeconomic benchmarks for achievement within 1 \nyear. Achievement of the benchmarks, thus demonstrating the commitment of governments to \nthe objectives of the TA, will be a prerequisite for implementation of phase 2 at each of the \nnational and state levels.  \n \n16.  Phase 2 will have as its outputs prioritized short-term action plans at national and state \nlevels, interlinked budget and planning cycles at national and state levels, strengthened capacity \nof relevant public sector officers to implement the plans, and strengthened processes and \ncapacity for performance-based budget implementation and monitoring.  \n \n17.  Activities in phase 2 will comprise (i) assessing progress in implementing the SDP; (ii) \ndeveloping achievable rolling priority action plans covering periods of 3\u20135 years for national and \nstate implementation, building on earlier planning assistance to the FSM; (iii) developing an \nannual cycle of planning review linked to the budget cycle, which supports inclusion of action \nplan priorities in the national/state budgets for funding and which seeks to update the rolling \naction  plans  and  monitor  progress  toward  SDP  implementation;  (iv)  holding  a  series  of \npractically oriented, participatory public sector workshops in all states to develop awareness and \nunderstanding of the operation and implications of the interlinked performance-based budget \nand planning cycles and to build capacity in support of sustained implementation; (v) assessing \nthe existing budget process and practices at national and state levels with a view to identifying \nweaknesses, and highlighting opportunities for strengthening the performance focus of the \nbudgets; (vi) developing the necessary procedures and administrative guidelines to allow the \nimplementation  of  a  strengthened  performance-based  budgeting  system,  which,  as  far  as \npossible,  is  consistent  across  governments;  and  (vii)  generating  demand  within  state \nlegislatures  and  the  national  Congress  by  conducting  seminars  and  workshops  to  build \nawareness and understanding of the use of performance information for policy-based decision \nmaking.  \n \n18.  A number of assumptions are important to the success of the TA. The tightened financial \nposition facing the FSM, in combination with the leadership changes coming from the 2007 \nelections,  creates  an  environment  conducive  to  tackling  the  weak  budget  and  planning \nprocesses that are constraining growth. It is assumed that this supportive environment will be \nmaintained. The greatest risks to the TA\u2019s success include (i) weakening of political support for \nimplementing expenditure cuts, which will necessarily arise in a situation where performance \n ", "  5\nbecomes a more important basis for budget allocation and revenue streams remain static; and \n(ii) failure to attract and retain suitable capacity at both national and state levels to follow \nthrough with implementation of the strengthened budget and planning processes.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $475,000 equivalent. Of that amount, $400,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan.  The  Government  of  the  FSM  will  finance  $75,000  equivalent  in  kind  through  the \nprovision of counterpart staff, office accommodations, and local communication. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  while \nimplementing agencies will include Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) and state \nbudget and planning offices. Under DEA, the TA focal point will be appointed, who will supervise \nthe activities of and liaise with the consultant team. The TA focal point and the team will work \nwith  the  Government  through  steering  committees  at  both  national  and  state  levels.  The \nconsultants will also consider the outcomes of related activities by other funding agencies, and \nwith the TA focal point liaise with relevant funding agency projects. The consultants will also \nliaise  with  the  DFA\u2019s  taxation  reform  project  manager  to  promote  coordination  and \ncomplementarities  in  activities.  Coordination  with  the  taxation  reform  project  manager  is \nparticularly important as the implementation of the taxation reform project will have implications \nfor national and state budgets and the ability of the FSM to implement its SDP. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented intermittently over a 3-year period, starting in October 2007 \nand ending in September 2010. Phase 2 should begin implementation by November 2008, \ndepending on achievement of the identified short-term benchmarks. The TA will finance 12 \nperson-months of international consulting services. The proposed consultants will be (i) a public \nfinancial management specialist/team leader (international, 9 person-months, intermittent); and \n(ii) a national planning specialist (international, 3 person-months, intermittent). ADB will engage \nthe  consultants  individually  based  on  their  qualifications  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Appendix 3 gives \nthe outline terms of reference. \n \n22.  An inception report will be prepared for ADB by the team leader within 2 weeks of the \nstart of field activities, a phase 1 implementation report by December 2007, a phase 2 readiness \nassessment by October 2008, a phase 2 work-in-progress report by August 2009, and a draft \nfinal  report  by  August  2010.  The  final  report  is  to  be  submitted  within  a  month  of  the \nincorporation of ADB comments on the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.
