INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Rural Economic Transformation \nand Upgrading by the Integration with Internet Plus.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for the PRC, 2016\u20132018.2 ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission to \nBeijing on 15\u201318 March 2016 and held discussions with the National Development and Reform \nCommission  (NDRC)  to  clarify  and  agree  on  the  TA\u2019s  scope,  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements.3 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.  The TA will review international and national practices and policies of internet plus \nagriculture  business  models.  The  TA  will  also  identify  constraints  and  opportunities  for \nparticipation of farmers and farmer organizations in internet plus economy. In addition, a policy \nnote will be prepared comprising regulatory and investment recommendations to develop PRC\u2019s \ninternet plus economy in the agriculture sector. The TA also aligns with ADB\u2019s core area of \noperations  and  the  strategic  priorities  outlined  in  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.4 \nSupporting inclusive economic growth is a focus of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the \nPRC, 2016\u20132020, which supports rural development by promoting good practices to strengthen \nagriculture productivity and value chain participation of rural households.5 Improved value chain \nlinkages and enhanced food safety are key priorities of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture \nand Natural Resources. It is envisaged to achieve these priorities through ADB operations \nsupport for the application of information and communication technology in agriculture and food \nvalue chains.6 The ADB lending program in the PRC provides support to agriculture value chain \ndevelopment including by linking agribusinesses and local entrepreneurs with poor farmers. 7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Although agriculture has been developing and making substantial contributions to the \nPRC\u2019s overall economic development since 1978, agricultural production and rural livelihoods \nhave lagged behind industrial production and urban livelihoods. The agricultural infrastructure is \ninsufficient and fragile, technological development and adoption levels are low, and constraints \non natural resources and the environment intensify challenges to agricultural development. \nThere is also an urgent demand for the sector to upgrade to modern technology and business \nmodels to boost production scale, develop value chains, and improve product safety.  \n \n4.  Agricultural modernization is regarded as a fundamental way to ensure food security, \ndevelop the rural economy, and close the income gaps between rural and urban areas. One \npriority of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of \nChina, held in Beijing on 26\u201329 October 2015, was for the PRC to improve its food security \ncapacity. The integration of the agricultural sector into the wider economy is identified as a \n                                                \n1  Internet plus refers to the enhancement of agricultural economy through improved information and communication \ntechnology and infrastructure. It includes mobile internet, internet of things, cloud computing, and big data. \n2   ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018.

Manila. \n ", "2     \nstrategy to boost agricultural productivity. The internet has shown to be a great advantage in \nintegrating, transforming, and upgrading agriculture value chains. In the PRC, the need for the \ncombination of internet and agriculture is urgent to rebuild the information and distribution \nchannels, and to coordinate value chain actors\u2019 practices in agricultural production, supply, and \nsales  systems.  High  production  costs  and  farmers\u2019  disadvantaged  status  against  market \ncompetition are a few characteristics of the existing complex agricultural and food value chain. \nIn addition, negative externalities, such as non-point source pollution and food safety problems, \nare  often  a result  of a  lack  of coordination,  aligned  incentives  of  value  chain  actors,  and \ntraceability of environmental and public health sensitive inputs and production practices. \n \n5.  The PRC is already implementing the so-called internet plus policies for the integration \nof agriculture value chains into secondary and tertiary industries. Several pilot projects have \nbeen initiated for enhancing the use of internet technologies to transform and integrate the rural \neconomy.  In  2014  and  2015,  the  Ministry  of Commerce  selected  256  counties to  pilot  e-\ncommerce in rural areas, and each pilot county will receive CNY10 million in funding support \nfrom the central government for rural logistics, an e-commerce service station, and primary \nprocessing facility development, as well as quality control systems and brand establishment. \nThe implementation of pilots to develop internet plus agriculture has shown many challenges \nand constraints regarding non-defined roles for government institutions in coordinating with the \nprivate sector, insufficient information and communication infrastructure in rural areas, data \nstandards, and insufficient participant incentives. This TA will focus on analyzing the challenges \nand  constraints  of  internet  plus  development  from  the  perspective  of  farmers  and  farmer \norganizations. Farmers and farmer cooperative organizations are not aware of the potential \nbenefits of internet technology use and also lack the necessary capabilities and skills. Further \nresearch, targeted at farmers and farmer organizations, is required to analyze farmers\u2019 internet \ntechnology knowledge, awareness, and practices.  \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be  a successfully restructured rural economy. The outcome will be \nfacilitated inclusive agriculture transformation. This will be achieved through NDRC\u2019s adoption of \ninternet plus agriculture policy recommendations. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will deliver three main outputs: (i) review of international and national practices \nand policies of internet plus agriculture business models; (ii) identification of constraints and \nopportunities for participation of farmers and farmer organizations in internet plus economy; and \n(iii)  formulation  of  policy,  regulatory,  and  investment  recommendations  to  develop  PRC\u2019s \ninternet plus economy in the agriculture sector.  \n \n8.  Output 1: Review of international and national practices and policies of internet \nplus  agriculture  business  models.  The  review  of  international  and  national  policies  will \nsummarize  national  and  international  best  practices  in  applying  internet  technologies,  e-\ncommerce, and other internet plus policies in the agriculture sector. The review will identify the \nrequired  policy  interventions  to  maximize  farmers\u2019  potential  benefits  from  using  internet \ntechnologies along specific food and agriculture value chains.   \n \n ", "  3 \n9.  Output  2:  Identification  of  constraints  and  opportunities  for  participation  of \nfarmers and farmer organizations in internet plus economy. The study report will be based \non case studies for internet plus business models and the application of internet technologies \nalong food and agriculture value chains. It will mainly focus on constraints and opportunities for \nfarmers  and  farmer  organizations  in  the  internet  plus  rural  transformation  and  integration. \nConstraints  and  opportunities  for  other  internet  plus  economy  stakeholders  will  also  be \nassessed to identify a balanced incentive structure for active participation. \n \n10.  Output 3: Formulation of policy, regulatory, and investment recommendations to \ndevelop the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s internet plus economy in the agriculture sector. \nThe policy note will synthesize and highlight policy implications from outputs 1 and 2 and \npropose  policy  options  for  accelerating  penetration  of  internet  technologies  with  increased \nbenefits for farmers and farmer organizations. This will include identifying public and private \nsector investment gaps for the application of internet technologies in agriculture.  \n \n11.  For NDRC to adopt and turn the TA outputs into reformulated national policies that \nfacilitate inclusive agriculture transformation, it is assumed that NDRC will communicate the \nproposed internet plus policy changes to stakeholders in agriculture and food value chains. As a \nrisk, however, failure to align incentives of public and private stakeholders for more integration \nof internet technologies in agriculture and food value chains may weaken inclusive agriculture \ntransformation.   \n \n12.  Activities to achieve the outputs include (i) reviewing literature to draw lessons from \nnational and international experiences on internet plus policies and ascertain business models \nfor rural transformation and integration; (ii) organizing two international study tours to the United \nStates and New Zealand, where successes in internet business model application to agriculture \nand  food  value  chains  may  be  applicable  to  the  PRC;  (iii)  conducting  field  visits  and \nconsultations  with  stakeholders\u2014such  as  local  governments,  enterprises,  and  farmers\u2014in \ncounties in the PRC\u2019s eastern (Zhejiang and Shandong), central (Hubei), and western (Yunnan) \nprovinces; (iv) collecting and analyzing data on farmers\u2019 and farmer organizations\u2019 participation \nin internet business models and the impact of internet plus policies on rural development; and \n(v) organizing TA workshops (inception, interim, and final) and an international conference to \npresent  and  discuss  the  project\u2019s  framework,  methodology,  and  periodic  results,  and  to \ndisseminate TA findings. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff time, data source access, administrative and \ncoordination support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.   The  NDRC\u2019s  Department  of  Rural  Economy  will  be  the  executing  agency.  A  TA \nmanagement office will be established to coordinate with ADB, providing guidance on project \nimplementation issues and ensuring intra- and inter-departmental coordination. The researcher \n(deputy director level) of the Department of Rural Economy\u2019s Comprehensive Division will serve \nas the TA management office chair and be responsible for day-to-day operational matters \namong ADB, consultants, and government agencies. The office will establish a leading group \n ", "4     \ncomprising  agriculture  and  e-commerce  agencies  and  representatives  from  the  relevant \ndepartments of the ministries of finance, agriculture, industry and information technology, and \ncommerce.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented for 18 months, from 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2017. The \nTA will require 2 person-months of international and 23 person-months of national consulting \nservices, as well as one international resource person.8 One international specialist (agricultural \neconomist) and three national specialists (team leader and rural development specialist, deputy \nteam  leader  and  agricultural  economist,  and  agriculture  information  and  communication \ntechnology specialist) will be required for implementation. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will engage the consultants following the Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  through  individual  consultant \nselection. 9  This  is  considered  the  most  efficient  method,  as  individual  experience  and \nqualifications  are  main  requirements  and  collective  responsibility  is  not.  TA  funds  will  be \ndisbursed following the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  follow  the  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-\nadministered TA projects. ADB will carry out monitoring and review missions at the project\u2019s \ninception, interim, and final phases. During these missions, ADB, the executing agency, the \nconsultants, and stakeholders will review the project\u2019s technical progress and provide feedback \nto improve the TA. Progress will be measured against the targets and indicators in the design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference, and reported in \nTA progress reports. ADB and local experts will review progress reports to provide additional \nfeedback and guidance. TA outputs will be presented and discussed with national stakeholders \nand during an international conference on internet agriculture. In addition, all TA reports will be \nmade available on ADB\u2019s webpage. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Rural Economic Transformation and \nUpgrading by the Integration with Internet Plus, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n                                                \n8  One resource person will be hired for specific expertise and separately from the consulting entity for 10 days. The \nresource person will not be part of the consultant team, but will work closely with the team to provide additional \nexpertise and support that is not available within the team.  \n9  Lump sum payments and/or output-based contracts will be considered for consulting services in line with Midterm \nReview Action Plan Nos. 2.9.2. and 2.10.2. \n ", "Appendix 1    5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact(s) the Project is Aligned with \nRural economy successfully restructured (Decisions of the Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of \nthe Communist Party of China).  \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nInclusive  By May 2018  a.
