THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The ensuing project will support the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to implement its \nRevised National Power Development Master Plan 2011\u20132020 (Revised PDP VII).1 The ensuing \nproject will (i) construct a new 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission line [approximately 372 double circuit-\nkilometer (cct-km)] from the northern to the central Viet Nam, ensuring more reliable power supply \nto load centers and (ii) install an intelligent transmission line monitoring system for efficient and \nproactive operation and maintenance, which will be the first intelligent monitoring system in Viet \nNam introduced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The use of high temperature, low sag \nconductors and/or low loss conductors will also be reviewed for possible inclusion to increase \nreliability and reduce technical losses. The ensuing project will contribute to provide adequate \nand reliable power supply for sustainable economic growth in Viet Nam. \n \n2.  One of the core problems in the power sector is insufficient power grid infrastructure to \nprovide adequate and reliable electricity supply to support economic development. In Viet Nam, \nthere is an imbalance between power generation and power demand across regions. The \nsouthern region is the biggest power load center accounting for about 50% of total power demand \nin the country.2 However, this region is short on generating capacity while the northern and central \nregions  are  in  surplus.  A  single  500  kV  backbone  transmission  line  (about  1,487  cct-km) \ncompleted in 1994 is currently the only connection between the northern and southern region. \nHowever, this overloaded line has reliability concerns due to occasional power faults that cause \nblackouts in some parts of the southern region. To address this issue, the National Power \nTransmission Corporation (NPT)3 is currently constructing a new 500 kV transmission line from \nthe central to the southern region, and seeks ADB support for a new 500 kV transmission line \nfrom the northern to the central region. \n \n3.  The Revised PDP VII projects the average power demand growth at 10.5% through 2020 \nand 8% during 2021\u20132030. Generation expansion plans to accommodate this power demand \ngrowth  require  commensurate transmission grid  expansion. To  address this  challenge, the \ngovernment prepared the master plan for the development of power grids in the Revised PDP VII, \nand the government prioritizes a new 500 kV transmission line from the northern to the central \nregion for ADB financing, which comprises three segments: (i) Nam Dinh-Thanh Hoa transmission \nline, (ii) Thanh Hoa-Quynh Lap transmission line, and (iii) Quynh Lap-Vung Ang transmission line. \n \n4.  The ensuing project has the following impact: adequate and reliable power supplied.4 This \nwill result from the following outcome: power transmission grid efficiency and reliability from \nNorthern to Central region increased. The outputs are (i) 500kV transmission line from Northern \nto Central region constructed and (ii) intelligent transmission line monitoring system installed and \noperational capacity improved. \n \n5.  The total estimated amount of the ensuing project is $220 million, of which $200 million \nwill be financed by an ADB loan from ordinary capital resources, and the balance of $20 million \nwill be provided by the government in counterpart financing. ADB will finance 91% of total project \ncosts. The transaction technical assistance (TA) is included in the country operation business \n                                                \n1  Government of Viet Nam. 2016.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n6.  The transaction TA will help the government to prepare the project to implement the \nensuing project. The TA will conduct feasibility study and prepare the relevant project documents \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements for approval of the ensuing project by ADB and the \ngovernment.  \n \nB.

Cost and Financing \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF VI). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1.  \n \n9.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff, \ncounterpart staff salaries, office space, and other in-kind contributions. The government was \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n ", "16  Appendix 3 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.
