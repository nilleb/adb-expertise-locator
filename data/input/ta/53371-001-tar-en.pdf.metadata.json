INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  strengthen  social \nprotection systems in Pacific developing member countries (DMCs). It will support the analysis \nand assessment of feasible investment options in social insurance,1 social assistance,2 and active \nlabor market programs;3 capacity building to improve social protection systems and delivery of \nsocial protection services for vulnerable groups; and sharing of knowledge on social protection  \namong Pacific DMCs.  \n \n2.  The TA is in line with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which \nunderscores the importance of social protection in addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities;4 and the Pacific Approach strategy of managing risks by improving health and social \nprotection services.5 It also supports the Sustainable Development Goals agenda of leaving no \none behind. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s regional operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for \nthe Pacific.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Increasing poverty, social exclusion, and vulnerability. Poverty, social exclusion, and \nvulnerability are rising in the Pacific, with about one in four Pacific Islanders living below national \npoverty lines in 2018.7 Inequality is evident in remote rural communities and among marginalized \npopulation groups where access to social services and job opportunities are limited. The typically \nsmall  and  limited  economic  base  of  Pacific  DMCs  constrains  job  opportunities.  Youth \nunemployment in 2013, for instance, averaged 23% in the region, compared with a global average \nof 13%.8 The problem is most marked for women, whose economic participation tends to be \nmostly in the informal sector\u2014as many as 75%\u201390% of informal market vendors in the Pacific \nare women (footnote 7). The burden of social exclusion for women is further aggravated by high \nlevels of violence against women in the region. The increasing intensity and frequency of climate- \nand  disaster-related  shocks  in  the  Pacific  heighten  vulnerability  among  the  population  by \nimpacting food security and depleting savings, making it difficult for families to meet their daily \nexpenditure needs.9 The recent threats of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) heightened the \nvulnerability of the Pacific given its weak health system. The impacts of COVID-19 including from \n \n1  Social insurance refers to contributory schemes to help people respond to common risks, such as illness, old age, \nand unemployment. \n2  Social assistance provides unrequited transfers to groups that cannot qualify for insurance or would receive \ninadequate benefits from such a source. \n3  Active labor market programs comprise cash and food-for-work programs as well as skills development and training \nprograms. \n4  ADB. 2018.

The World Risk Index ranked \nVanuatu (1), Tonga (3), Solomon Islands (4), and Papua New Guinea (6) among the 10 countries most at-risk to the \neffects of climate change and natural disasters. \n ", "2 \neconomic and social disruptions will disproportionately impact the poor and vulnerable groups \nwho have no means to recoup quickly. \n \n4.  Demographic  challenges.  The  region\u2019s  changing  demographics  place  additional \npressure on economies and societies. People aged 10\u201324 represent the largest population group, \nbut the number and proportion of older people are rising. The number of people aged 60 years or \nolder in the Pacific was about 512,000 as of 2014, and is projected to reach 1 million by 2030 and \n2 million by 2050.10 The estimated proportion of older people is more than 10% in most Pacific \ncountries, and is higher in the Cook Islands and Niue as of 2014. At least 1.5 million Pacific \nIslanders, or 15% of the total Pacific population, are living with some form of disability as of 2018 \n(footnote 7). The number is rising because of high rates of diabetes-related amputations and \nblindness,11 plus an aging population. These demographic changes will have implications for the \nlabor force, financial markets, and traditional and formal social protection systems. \n \n5.  Traditional social protection systems under stress. Vulnerable groups rely on the \nsupport of strong family and community ties during times of need. However, these traditional \nsocial protection systems are coming under stress from rising urbanization and migration, which \nweaken community ties.12 Traditional support systems are also less effective in mitigating events \nthat affect the entire community, such as economic crises and natural hazards. Susceptibility to \nnatural hazards among Pacific countries, for instance, stretches the resilience of families and \ncommunities. Their ability to support each other is constrained by their common poverty or similar \ncircumstance, hence the need for governments to play a greater role in providing social protection \nfor the vulnerable, while drawing upon local social values and community systems of mutual \nassistance. The TA will consider key lessons from a previous ADB project, Social Protection of \nthe Vulnerable in the Pacific,  in supporting the establishment of a formal social protection system \nin  Pacific  DMCs,  such  as  collecting  baseline  and  disaggregated  data  to  strengthen \nimplementation and monitoring; exploring opportunities for volunteers to be involved; and putting \nin  place  service  standards  and  continuous  capacity  building  to  ensure  quality  of  care  for \nvulnerable groups.13 \n \n6.  Inadequate formal social protection system. ADB\u2019s Social Protection Indicator for the \nPacific:  Assessing  Progress  reports  that  formal  social  protection  systems  are  generally \nundeveloped in the Pacific, with the exception of social insurance and provident funds that mainly \ntarget those with formal employment in the public sector.14 This poses further challenges with \nincreased demands for social assistance under a pandemic such as COVID-19. The report found \nthat average social protection expenditures in 2015 accounted for 5.3% of gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita and favored men over women. Social insurance, particularly spending on old-\nage pensions, dominates social protection spending in the region. Performance across the Pacific \nisland  groups  varies,  with  Micronesia  spending  relatively  higher  on  social  insurance,  and \nMelanesia and Polynesia spending higher on social assistance.15 Spending on labor market \n \n10 United Nations Population Fund. 2014.

According to this report, 69% of people with diabetes have \nretinopathy and 11% have diabetes-related amputations in some Pacific countries. \n12 More than 50% of the total population in the Cook Islands, Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, and Palau live in urban \nareas. Migration levels are higher in Polynesia and Micronesia than in Melanesia, with the exception of Fiji. \n13 ADB. 2010.

Social protection covered only 31.2% of \nintended beneficiaries in 2015, leaving two-thirds of eligible people without support. Social \nprotection benefits also fail to reach the poor; social welfare expenditures were 1.4% of GDP per \ncapita for the poor and 3.9% of GDP per capita for the nonpoor. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: government capacity and leadership in social \nprotection development in selected Pacific DMCs enhanced. The TA will have the following \noutcome: social protection systems and programs strengthened in selected Pacific DMCs.16 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  The TA is designed to address piecemeal and weakly targeted social protection measures \nin the Pacific and expand social protection systems to promote sustainable support for the \nvulnerable. It will offer broad support to meet the distinct needs of the region by focusing on social \ninsurance, social assistance, and active labor market programs. Although all Pacific DMCs will be \neligible for assistance under the TA upon request, the initial focus will be on Papua New Guinea, \nTonga, and possibly the Cook Islands, all of which have requested ADB support for strengthening \ntheir social protection systems. Additional support will target regional activities such as social \nprotection workshops.17 Priorities will also be given to assist Pacific DMCs in responding to \nCOVID-19 and other climate and disaster related shocks under all the TA outputs.   \n \n9.  Output 1: Gender-responsive social protection policies and investments identified \nand prioritized. The TA  will provide technical expertise, assessments, diagnostics, and other \nanalytical work to selected Pacific DMCs to (i) formulate or strengthen gender-responsive social \nprotection policies and regulations suitable to the country context; and (ii) identify innovative, \ngender-responsive social protection projects and programs and assess their appropriateness for \nthe selected countries. An assessment of how using technology can enhance social protection \nsystems in the Pacific will draw from the experience of the Republic of Korea in applying \ntechnology in the provision of social services. Under output 1, the TA will provide on-the-job \ntraining to governments to help build a cadre of staff at the national level who are familiar with the \ncritical elements of preparing social protection investments.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Capacity in building social protection systems and delivery of social \nprotection services for vulnerable groups improved. Under this output, the TA will build the \ncapacity of selected Pacific DMCs in strengthening social protection systems and delivering \nservices to vulnerable groups such as older people, people with disabilities, households headed \nby women, and poor households. The TA will examine the enabling factors and challenges to \nimplementing social protection systems effectively and will assist in building government capacity  \nto sustain  and improve the quality of care services for vulnerable groups. Under this output, the \nTA will collect data disaggregated by age, disability and sex to build evidence on the positive \nimpacts of gender responsive design on social protection outcomes. \n \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17 Strengthening social protection for the elderly, including the delivery of elderly care services, are relevant in the Cook \nIslands and Tonga as they are among the fastest aging countries in the Pacific. Papua New Guinea, meanwhile, has \nthe lowest expenditure on social protection in the Pacific. \n ", "4 \n  \n11.  Output 3: Social protection partnerships strengthened and knowledge products \nproduced and shared among Pacific developing member countries.  Under this output, the \nTA  will help create knowledge solutions to (i) improve the design and delivery of social protection \nservices in Pacific countries, and support regional conferences and workshops to promote \nknowledge and experience sharing among Pacific DMCs; and (ii) generate conference papers \nand publications on social protection as a relatively new field in the Pacific. The output will \ncontribute  to  strengthening  partnerships  among  Pacific  countries  and  will  support  the \nestablishment of a social protection network in the Pacific in coordination with development \npartners and other key stakeholders.18 The social protection network is envisaged to be part of \nexisting government partnerships in the region to be sustainable. Output 3 will also draw from the \nexperience of outputs 1 and 2 in disseminating findings and lessons. The TA will prepare a \nknowledge product dissemination plan in consultation with stakeholders and potential users of \nthe information. In addition, a learning event on aged care will be held in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina in collaboration with experts and relevant institutions in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund  (TASF-Others [$150,000] and TASF 6 \n[$350,000]), (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund administered by ADB, and (iii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund (PRC \nFund)19 administered by ADB.20 The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund \nwill be mostly allocated to undertake prefeasibility assessments and support social protection \npolicies and regulatory frameworks under output 1. The PRC Fund will be prioritized toward \nsupport for aged care systems and knowledge products on this topic across all outputs. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented from April 2020 to March 2025. ADB, through the Pacific \nDepartment, will administer the TA. The Pacific Department will work closely with the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department to ensure complementarity with the existing TA \non social protection (footnote 18).  The focal agency of each participating government will assist \nADB in implementing the TA. Participating governments will provide counterpart support in the \nform  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and  other  in-kind  assistance,  if  necessary.  Pacific \nDepartment will maintain close coordination with field offices, other development partners, and \nregional organizations in the Pacific. Disbursement of TA proceeds will follow ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The implementation \narrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n \n \n \n18 This activity will ensure complementarity with the proposed social protection network in Asia and the Pacific under \nADB. 2018.
