INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  institutional \nstrengthening of the national statistical system (NSS) of Myanmar in collaboration with the Central \nStatistical Organization (CSO) and the Planning Department of the Ministry of Planning and \nFinance of Myanmar.1 The TA will build on the achievements of an earlier Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  project\u2014Technical  Assistance  for  Myanmar  for  Capacity  Development  of  the \nNational Statistical System\u2014financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and completed \nin June 2019.2 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the approved 2019 work plan of ADB\u2019s Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department (ERCD) and supports one of the five priority themes of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) 2017\u20132021 for Myanmar\u2014the capacity and governance \ntheme, which aims to accelerate the country\u2019s transformation process by intensifying its focus on \ncapacity development and governance.3 The TA also supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 Operational \nPlans: Operational Priority 6: Strengthening Governance and Institutional Capacity, 2019\u20132024, \nwhich states that building strong statistical institutions to improve availability of timely and reliable \nstatistics is essential for informed decision-making and inclusive development; and is aligned with \nthe Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data through target 17.19 of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, which aims to support initiatives for measuring progress on sustainable \ndevelopment and statistical capacity building in developing countries. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB identified capacity and governance as one of the development challenges related to \nits reengagement with Myanmar in 2012. For a country in transition to a market economy like \nMyanmar, capacity development that will accelerate its transformation process is crucial in \nsupporting the government\u2019s policy priority of improving the quality of life of its people. Myanmar\u2019s \neconomic  vision  is  to  achieve  inclusive  and  sustainable  economic  development,  and  the \ngovernment has committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and tracking the \nprogress through a set of measurable indicators. ADB\u2019s CPS 2017\u22122021 indicates that the \ncapacity of the public sector is underdeveloped and poses a significant challenge to basic service \ndelivery. The CPS further underlines the importance of statistics to the development of Myanmar, \nspecifically indicating that \u201cthe quality, timeliness, and accessibility of Myanmar\u2019s economic and \nsocial statistics, while improving with ongoing development support, remain poor and constrained \nby weak institutional and human capacity.\u201d Capacity development and governance, a priority \ntheme of the CPS, support evidence-based reforms and planning, not least the strengthening of \nnational statistics and analytical capacity. With assistance from ADB and other development \npartners, the ability of Myanmar\u2019s NSS to produce quality and timely statistics has been improving, \nbut much room remains for long-term and sustained support to strengthen institutions, upgrade \ntheir standards and methods so as to improve data quality and accessibility, and build statistical \ninfrastructure and human capacity.   \n \n \n1   A knowledge and support TA may be used for capacity development, policy advice, and research and development. \nThe TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2019. \n2  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to Myanmar for Capacity Development of the National Statistical System. Manila \n(TA 8377). \n3  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Myanmar, 2017\u22122021\u23afBuilding the Foundations for Inclusive Growth. \nManila. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  The Statistics and Data Innovation Unit of the ERCD (EROD-SDI)4 was engaged with \nstrengthening Myanmar\u2019s NSS through phase 1 of the TA implemented from June 2013 to June \n2019 (footnote 2). Through that TA phase, ADB comprehensively assessed the institutional and \nlegal aspects of Myanmar\u2019s NSS; provided extensive inputs to the preparation of the National \nStrategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS); drafted a new statistics law for Myanmar to replace \nthe outdated Statistics Act of 1952 (the Parliament of Myanmar promulgated the new Statistics \nLaw of 2018 in January 2018); drafted statistics rules for implementing the Statistics Law of 2018; \nassessed the system of national accounts statistics of Myanmar and drafted a strategy for \nadopting the latest standards\u2014the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA); provided TA \nand built the capacity for adopting the 2008 SNA framework for the compilation of national \naccounts statistics; provided support for developing a statistical business register (SBR) in the \nCSO; built the internal training capacity of the CSO; and supported several internal and external \ntraining programs to build the skills of staff of the CSO, Planning Department, and line ministries.  \n \n5.  More is needed to expand national data sets and improve the quality and timeliness of \ndata for monitoring government programs and to support evidence-based policies to achieve \ninclusive and sustainable development. The CSO prepared the Implementation Plan of the \nNational Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS-IP) to steer statistical production toward \nmeeting users\u2019 data needs.5 It sets out eight strategies to bring about systematic improvements \nin the NSS and to improve subject matter programs and methodologies. A key lesson from the \nphase 1 TA and from the implementation of the interim CPS for 2012\u22122014 for Myanmar was that \nsustainable capacity building is a gradual and long-term process, which should evolve from \nproject-specific approaches to sector- and country-system development activities.6 This implies \nthat the efforts that were started under the phase 1 TA and even under the TA projects of other \ndevelopment partners in Myanmar must be sustained for Myanmar\u2019s NSS to continue going up \nthe ladder of sustainable statistical development. Hence, the phase 2 TA will further build on the \nachievements of the phase 1 TA, and is aligned with four of the eight strategic priorities outlined \nin the NSDS-IP\u2014i.e., improvements in the legal and organizational infrastructure, in the statistical \ninfrastructure, in human resource capacity, and in economic statistics. These are also broadly the \nstrategic areas for which the CSO and the Planning Department received phase 1 support and \nwhere they have expressed interest for continuing ADB support. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: The ability of the NSS of Myanmar to support \nevidence-based policymaking and monitor the achievement of development targets improved.7 \nThe TA will have the following outcome: institutional and technical capacity of the NSS of \nMyanmar for producing timely and quality statistics strengthened.8 \n \n \n4  ERCD\u2019s realignment in January 2019 led to the creation of EROD-SDI, which consists of the statistics group of the \nerstwhile Development Economics and Indicators Division.  \n5  CSO, recognized as the national statistical agency under the Statistics Law 2018, formulated the NSDS with support \nfrom the World Bank and in collaboration with ADB and other development partners. TA 8377 (footnote 2) provided \nextensive inputs and recommendations for the development of the NSDS. The NSDS-IP for 2018\u201319 to 2022\u201323 \nprovides strategic directions and actions for implementing the NSDS and is also a valuable coordination mechanism \nfor development partners in supporting national priorities for strengthening capacity of Myanmar\u2019s NSS. \n6  ADB. 2012.

Output 1: Instruments of the institutional and legal capacity of Myanmar\u2019s national \nstatistical system strengthened. In the context of the newly adopted Statistics Law 2018 and \nthe draft statistics rules supported under the phase 1 TA, the TA team will support the CSO in \nfinalizing and approving the statistics rules and their implementation. It will provide technical \nsupport to the CSO for initiating actions that will strengthen its role of leading the NSS, as \nmandated  under  the  Statistics  Law,  and  for  creating  awareness  and  understanding  of  its \nprovisions on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Central Statistical Organization and Planning Department management \ncapacity strengthened. Expert engaged through the TA will provide advisory services to the \nCSO management to support its role as secretariat of the Central Committee for Data Accuracy \nand Quality of Statistics. This involves policies and actions needed for managing and coordinating \nnational statistical operations, coordinating with development partners and stakeholders, and \nimplementing the provisions of the statistics rules. The TA team will also organize learning \nmissions  for  CSO  and  Planning  Department  to  neighboring  countries  with  well-developed \nstatistical systems to harness good management and coordination practices, including data \ndissemination and adoption of technology in modernizing statistical systems.9 \n \n9.  Output 3: Compilation of national accounts statistics of Myanmar based on the \nframework of the 2008 System of National Accounts improved. The TA will build on the \nprogress of the phase 1 TA in implementing the 2008 SNA framework and assist the Planning \nDepartment in further improving the national accounts statistics and methodology. The TA will \nsupport rebasing10 of the national accounts series following the 2008 SNA framework to the extent \npermitted by available data sources and producing supply-use tables for a benchmark year, \ndocumentation and publishing of sources and methods, and release and revision of annual \nnational accounts estimates. The TA will support learning from the proven good practices and \nsystems of other developing countries in producing national accounts statistics. \n \n10.  Output 4: Human resources and technical skills improved. The phase 1 TA built a \ngood foundation for the internal training capacity of the CSO and supported various training \nprograms for newly recruited and existing staff of the CSO and some line ministries. The TA team \nwill continue to strengthen the CSO\u2019s internal training capacity to enable it to effectively perform \nits role as the training provider for staff in the CSO and line ministries. It will conduct in-country \ntraining in specialized areas of official statistics with direct application to the compilation of official \nstatistics and for the modernization of statistical processes. To professionalize the statistician \ncareer in Myanmar, the TA will also support external short- and long-term training, including \nhigher-level formal statistics education in coordination with centers of excellence.11 The CSO\u2019s \ntraining room also needs upgrading, and  the TA will provide limited support for the purchase of \n \n9  The countries for the learning missions will be decided after identifying the specific learning objectives and strengths \nof the national statistical offices of other countries, such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. \n10 In national accounts compilation, rebasing implies replacing the old base year used for compiling the constant price \nestimates to a new or more recent base year. \n11  Target institutions to provide such training will be selected from knowledge centers like the International Statistical \nEducation Centre (ISEC) in India, Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific (SIAP) in Japan, the International \nMonetary Fund\u2019s regional training institutes in Singapore and India, and relevant training and educational institutes \nin neighboring countries such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. ADB TA grants in the 1990s \nsupported the staff of Cambodia\u2019s National Institute of Statistics in obtaining higher statistics education in the \nPhilippines, and these candidates now occupy leadership positions in Cambodia\u2019s National Institute of Statistics. \n \n ", "4 \ncomputers, software, and other equipment for the smooth conduct of training activities. Moreover, \nthe TA team will explore ways for staff to learn some specific technical skills through staff \nexchange programs with other national statistics offices. \n \n11.  Output 5: Statistical infrastructure strengthened through continued development of \nthe statistical business register and of classifications and standards. An SBR is useful in \nthe production of business statistics and also serves as sampling frame for business surveys, \nwhich are essential inputs for key economic statistics such as national accounts statistics. They \nprovide better understanding of the business landscape (across all industries and business sizes) \nof an economy. The phase 1 TA prepared the ground by setting up the ADB SBR system in the \nCSO.12 To sustain that system, the TA team will support technical improvements and build the \ntechnical capacity of the CSO\u2019s SBR team for updating and maintaining the SBR. Finally, the TA \nwill support the finalization of the Myanmar version of the International Standard Industrial \nClassification in line with the classification needs of the Myanmar economy.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, logistics and administrative support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Ministry of Planning and Finance will be the executing agency, while the CSO and \nthe Planning Department will be the implementing agencies. ADB will administer the TA through \nEROD-SDI. ADB will recruit international and national consultants through individual consultant \nselection and carry out procurement activities (paras. 16 and 17). ADB will select, supervise, and \nevaluate the consultants; procure goods; organize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource \npersons in the workshops. \n \n15.
