THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $20,000,000 in tenge equivalent to RG Brands Kazakhstan LLP for the Inclusive Beverage \nProduction and Distribution Project. \n \n2.  The project will support the expansion of the RG Brands Group (RGB) across the \nbeverage value chain through the financing of (i) energy efficient coolers for retail distribution in \nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic and (ii) production equipment in Kazakhstan. The project \nwill support the diversification of the Kazakhstan economy by enhancing non-oil exports and will \nimprove the livelihoods of shopkeepers and support women\u2019s empowerment in both countries. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT    \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Kazakhstan\u2019s middle-income country challenge. From 2010 to 2018, gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 4.5%, reaching $9,331 in 2018; and the share \nof the population living below the national poverty line fell from 6.5% to 2.5%.1 However, the global \nfinancial crisis of 2007\u20132008 and the tenge devaluations of 2014\u20132015 considerably reduced \neconomic growth; and Kazakhstan continues to need to diversify its economy from natural \nresources, which still accounted for 16% of gross domestic product (footnote 1) and 90% of \nexports in 2017.2 To diversify and transcend its middle-income country challenges, productivity \nand competitiveness need to increase in the non-oil private sector, supported by appropriate \ninvestment, capacity building and innovation.3 \n \n4.  Kazakhstan\u2019s underdeveloped food and agriculture sector. Agriculture represents 4% \nof Kazakhstan\u2019s GDP (footnote 1) and 6% of exports (footnote 2). Local agricultural products are \ngenerally less competitive than imported products, due to lower productivity and quality. Further, \ncapacity  utilization  in  the  food  industry  remains  low  due  to  obsolescence  and  physical \ndeterioration of fixed assets. Food safety systems are underdeveloped, and agricultural exports \ncontinue to be plagued by a lack of logistics, imperfections in legislations and insufficient efforts \nfor brand promotion.4 \n \n5.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s development priorities. The Kyrgyz Republic is a lower-middle \nincome country, with GDP per capita at the lower end of Central Asian countries ($1,281 in 2018). \nPoverty remains high at 26% in 2017, based on the national poverty line, and uneven across the \ncountry (74% of the poor live in rural areas). The Kyrgyz Republic critically needs to create \nemployment and livelihoods opportunities in all productive sectors. As the country is a small and \nlandlocked economy, regional cooperation and integration is also a national imperative.5  \n \n6.  Regional integration in Central Asia. As part of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), \nall markets in the union, including Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, come under common \n \n1 World Bank. World Development Indicators.

This  is  beneficial  to  food  and  beverage \nmanufacturers who can access a larger market and increase cross border exports, strengthening \nagricultural value chains. The EEU also provides a common external tariff that offers some \nprotection vis-\u00e0-vis imports from third countries, with tariffs on flavored and sweetened drinks \n(8%), juice (10%), packaged tea (12%) and bottled water (15%). \n \n7.  Borrower\u2019s  selection.  RGB  is  a leading  food  and  beverage  group  in  Kazakhstan, \nproducing milk, tea, juice, water, and other packaged beverages. ADB had provided a loan to the \ngroup in 2013.6 Given ADB\u2019s long-term relationship with RGB, ADB was approached for financing \nanother round of expansion [Redacted]. ADB again assessed the financing needs of the company \nand found it to be suitable given its continued solid operational and financial track record. \n[Redacted] \n \n2.  Project design \n \n8.  The  project  consists  of  (i)  the  expansion  and  strengthening  of  RGB\u2019s  distribution \ninfrastructure, (ii) the expansion and upgrading of production lines for beverages, (ii) working \ncapital for beverage production and distribution, and (iv) potential acquisitions that would further \nboost RGB\u2019s and shopkeeper\u2019s sales. The project is central to RGB\u2019s strategy of improving \nproduction and distribution efficiency and maintaining and expanding direct access to customers \nin Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. [Redacted] \n \n9.  Energy  efficiency  and  inclusive  distribution.  The  project  will  help  expand  and \nstrengthen RGB\u2019s distribution infrastructure across Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The \nfunds will be invested in energy efficient coolers (which will reduce annual emission of CO ) that \n2\nwill be deployed in small convenience stores, of which at least 50% owned by women. [Redacted] \nGiven the large territory of Kazakhstan, efficient distribution is critical. RGB works with about \n44,000 small convenience stores, including more than half in rural areas. These stores are often \nowned and run by families that lack the financial resources to buy their own equipment. RGB will \nalso place coolers in the Kyrgyz Republic. This will reduce concentration risk for RGB and improve \nnon-farm livelihoods for small shopkeepers in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n10.  Resource efficient beverage production. The investment will include a new bottling line \nfor flavored water and other beverages and the upgrading of existing juice and water bottling lines, \nto increase production efficiency, notably through reduced usage of both energy and plastics, \nused in bottles and caps. The project will also support modernization across RGB\u2019s existing \nproduction facilities, to improve cost and energy efficiency, as well as partly finance the company\u2019s \nincremental working capital requirements. \n \n11.  Corporate governance technical assistance (TA). As a complement to the project, ADB \nwill  provide  TA  to  RGB  to  enhance  its  corporate  governance,  including  through  deeper \nengagement with stakeholders in the beverage value chain.7 The TA will help RGB strengthen \ncorporate policies. The TA will support an inclusive business approach for RGB\u2019s engagement \nwith shopkeepers, with the implementation of a monitoring mechanism to track the gender and \nincome of the shopkeepers and trainings for women shop owners on financial literacy and digital \ntechnology. The TA will help RGB engage with local and central governments to improve the \n \n6  ADB. 2013.

Finally, the TA will support RGB in conducting an \noutreach program to raise consumer awareness on the health impact of sweet beverages and \nalternatives.  The  TA  will  draw  on  international  expertise  in  corporate  governance,  circular \neconomy, and responsible consumption, which is not readily available in Kazakhstan or the \nKyrgyz Republic. \n \n3.  The Borrower \n \n12.  Established in 1994, RGB is a leading producer of milk, tea, juice, water, and other \npackaged beverages in Kazakhstan. With leading brands and dominant market shares in key \nsegments, a modern production base and a strong management team, RGB is focused on \nbecoming the largest and most efficient food and beverage group in Central Asia by 2025. \n[redacted] \n \n13.  RGB has two main production centers: Kostanay and Aksengir. A third, smaller production \nfacility, Tealand, hosts the tea packaging activity, just outside of Almaty.  \n \n14.  RGB has its own extensive, nationwide sales and distribution platform.  \n  \nRGB\u2019s founder and majority shareholder is a well-known businessman, Kairat Mazhibayev, who \nowns the business through a holding company: JSC RG Brands.  \n \n15.  RGB directly employs about 2,400 staff, who receive benefits in compliance with local \nlabor law. In addition, about 3,000 households indirectly depend on RGB for their livelihood (e.g., \ndairy farmers, juice concentrate factory workers, fruit farmers and shopkeepers). \n \n16.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.8 RGB\u2019s founder, shareholders, managers and \nsignificant contracting entities do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant \nintegrity risk, as there is no unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other information \n \nrelated to them. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.\n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n17.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the fifth target of sustainable development goal (SDG) \n5 (gender equality): \u201censure women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for \nleadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life\u201d. The project will \nalso contribute the second target of SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): \u201cachieve higher \nlevels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, \nincluding through a focus on high-value added and labor-intensive sectors\u201d.9 \n \n18.  Outcome.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  is  inclusive  production  and  distribution  of  quality \nbeverages promoted. At least 7,000 additional shopkeepers will benefit from cooler-generated \nsales in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. Further, RBG will create at least 138 jobs (including \n125 for women) in Kazakhstan.  \n \n \n8  ADB. 2003.

The project\u2019s outputs are: (i) Kazakhstan gender inclusive investment plan \ncompleted, and (ii) RGB as a more gender inclusive employer. RGB has committed to a gender \naction plan (para. 41). \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n20.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which calls for ADB: (i) \u201cto scale up its financing for agribusiness\u201d; (ii) to \n\u201cpromote commercial sustainability through high standards of corporate governance, integrity, \ntransparency, and environmental and social safeguards\u201d, and (iii) to promote gender equality in \nat least 75% of the number of ADB\u2019s committed operations by 2030.10 The project is also aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies, for Kazakhstan (2017\u20132021) and for the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  (2018\u20132022).11 The  country  strategy  for  Kazakhstan  identifies  strengthening  the \nfoundations for economic diversification through private sector development as a key operational \npriority. The strategy also emphasizes the role that ADB can play to contribute to inclusive \ndevelopment and reducing spatial and gender inequalities. The project is also aligned with the \ncountry strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic, which identifies the strengthening of agricultural value \nchains and promotion of regional integration and cooperation as key focus areas. \n \n21.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 5 (Promoting Rural Development and \nFood Security, 2019\u20132024) as the plan emphasizes the importance of \u201clocal value addition for \nboth domestic and export markets\u201d and \u201copportunities to make an impact in the fast-growing \nbranded food, modern retail, and e-commerce sectors\u201d. The project is also aligned with Strategy \n2030 Operational Plan for Priority 7 of Strategy 2030: (Fostering Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration), which makes the development of regional trade a strategic priority.12 The project is \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s sovereign operations in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, notably \nthe ongoing TA by ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department to support the development of \nagricultural wholesale markets in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, within the Almaty-Bishkek \nEconomic Corridor framework.13 \n \nD.

The project is ADB\u2019s first regional agribusiness project in Central Asia. RGB will contribute \nto providing livelihoods to small retailers Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic by enabling them \nto participate in the high-quality beverage value chain. RGB has also committed to a gender action \nplan which aims to increase women\u2019s empowerment across the beverage value chain (para. 41). \nFinally, an innovative approach to corporate governance TA will help promote new models for \ninclusive business, circular economy, and responsible consumption (para. 11). \n \nIII.  THE ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n23.  ADB proposes to provide a loan facility of up to $20.0 million in tenge equivalent to RGB \nKAZ. [redacted] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  ADB assistance will add value on several fronts: \n(i)  Long term funding. ADB will provide long term financing in tenge, which is not \nreadily available in Kazakhstan. Macro-economic conditions are volatile, affecting \nthe stability of the banking sector. Given this, RGB prefers to limit its reliance on \nlocal banks as they are unable to provide sufficient financing to sustain its growth. \n(ii)  Corporate governance. ADB will promote better corporate governance standards \nand will provide corporate governance TA, including international expertise on \nstakeholder engagement (para. 11). \n(iii)  Gender inclusion. ADB will promote gender equality through a gender action \nplan. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[Redacted] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n25.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category C), involuntary resettlement (category C) and \nindigenous peoples (category C).14 \n \n26.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  RGB  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n27.  RGB has implemented a corporate wide Environmental and Social Management System \n(ESMS) per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) since 2013. The two bottling plants \n \n14 ADB. Safeguard Categories. Manila. \n ", "6 \n(Aksengir  and  Kostanay)  also  implement  environmental,  health  and  safety  and  quality \nmanagement systems that are certified to ISO14001, OHSAS18001 and ISO9001 standards as \nwell as \u2018good management practices\u2019 for food manufacturing \n \n28.   Based on the due diligence conducted, the key anticipated impacts on the environment \nare  related  to  potential  greenhouse  gas  release  from  replaced  cooling  units  and  waste \nmanagement. [Redacted] The project will also have an indirect impact related to increased \nproduction of containers for beverage products, leading to increased generation of solid waste. \nTo mitigate this impact, the project will introduce technology that will reduce the usage of plastic \nfor bottles and caps. In addition, ADB\u2019s TA will assist RGB in the identification of opportunities to \nfurther reduce the usage of plastics and improve recycling mechanisms, in coordination with \npublic sector stakeholders. The project will also enhance the energy efficiency of production lines \nand introduce more energy efficient coolers. The project may also have an indirect impact related \nto increased production of sugar sweetened drinks, leading to health impacts. This impact will be \nmitigated by the increase in demand for low- or no-sugar drinks (including many of RGB products \nsuch as water and flavored water) and ADB\u2019s TA will assist RGB in the development of awareness \ncampaign on the impacts of unhealthy diets and excessive sugar consumption. Finally, gaps \nregarding corporate policies will also be addressed by a gender action plan (para. 41) and through \nADB\u2019s TA (para. 11). \n \n29.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), RGB has incorporated measures to promote gender equality in its business activities.  \n \n30.  RGB will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments \nusing ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s SPS and abide by national laws and regulations, and (iii) \nestablish and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement. The ESMS \nwill set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor laws and measures to \ncomply with internationally-recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001).15 The ESMS will also contain requirements, as applicable, for information \ndisclosure and consultation with affected people following ADB requirements. RGB will report \nregularly to ADB on its compliance with such laws and the measures taken.16 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n31.  RGB was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
