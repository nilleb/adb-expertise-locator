During the 2003 Country Strategy and Programming Update Mission, the Government of \nIndonesia agreed to include the Urban Air Quality Improvement Sector Development Program \n(the Program) in the 2005 pipeline of projects for Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. \nADB intermittently fielded a Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission) from 16 March to 11 May 2004, \nfor the technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Program. The Mission and Government reached \nan  understanding  on  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  cost,  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference, \nimplementation arrangements, and schedule.1 A preliminary project logical framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rapid urbanization and weak enforcement  mechanisms and strategies in Indonesia \nhave made air pollution a significant urban health threat, more so for the poor, and resulted in \nloss of productivity for the nation. The United Nations Environmental Program ranks Jakarta as \nthe world\u2019s third most polluted megacity, after Mexico and Bangkok. Levels of lead, nitrogen \ndioxide, and particulates in the air are significantly higher than World Health Organization \nstandards. Vehicle fleet and industry are two major air pollution sources. Air pollution costs the \neconomy at least $400 million every year, which could increase 10-fold by 2010 in the absence \nof pollution control. \n \n3.  ADB has been providing TA and financing support to its developing member countries to \nprepare  policies  and  strategies  to  improve  urban  air  quality.2  Lessons  learned  show  that \nimprovement of urban air quality requires multisectoral commitment to formulating and enforcing \nmultisectoral policies and regulatory frameworks; adopting regulations and standards in stages; \nand strengthening enforcement capacity and facilities, including those of sectoral agencies and \nlocal governments.  \n \n4.  Parliament has enacted laws on air quality management, including Act 14 of 1992 on \ntraffic and land transportation, Act 23 of 1997 on environmental management, and Act 22 of \n2001 on oil and gas. The Ministry of Environment (MOE) has issued regulations, including \nministerial decrees 35/1993 on Emission Standard for Motor Vehicles, 15/1996 on Blue Sky \nProgram, and 45/1997 on Air Pollutants Structured Index. The Ministry of Communications has \nalso released ministerial decrees 6 and 7 of 1997 on an environmental management plan and \nan environmental monitoring plan for the transportation sector. Other programs, decrees, and \nstandards are associated with air quality management, directed at controlling emissions from \nvehicles and stationary sources. The principal ministries involved in air quality management are \nenvironment, communications, and energy and mineral resources. The governor of Jakarta has \nalso issued relevant decrees. \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 May 2004. \n2   ADB. 1998.

The Government launched the Blue Sky Program in 1996, which includes controlling \nactivities for stationary and mobile sources. For stationary sources, the earlier phase of the \nprogram focused on plants producing cement, iron and steel, pulp and paper, and coal-fired \npower,  and  targeted  five  of  the  largest  cities:  Bandung,  Jakarta,  Medan,  Semarang,  and \nSurabaya. Due to weak enforcement and coordination among agencies and lack of funding and \na monitoring mechanism, implementation of the Blue Sky Program has been slow. Supply of \nclean fuel such as unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, and natural gas has been delayed or \nfailed. Air monitoring has not been consistent or scientific enough to produce an authoritative air \nquality database for strategic planning. \n \n6.  The challenges to enforcement increased after decentralization in 2001. Act 22 of 1999, \nwhich came into effect on 1 January 2001, gives regional governments increased powers to \nregulate and manage their functions. The lack of a comprehensive implementation framework, \ncoupled  with  regional  governments\u2019  limited  capacity  to  manage  air  quality,  weakens \nenforcement of air quality regulations and harms the health and welfare of urban residents.  \n \n7.  An ADB TA3 helped MOE develop a draft policy paper on reducing vehicle emissions, \nwhich is expected to be endorsed by the minister and other concerned ministers in 2004. The \npaper identified six major categories of actions to be adopted by ministries and agencies to \nimprove vehicle emissions: (i) air quality monitoring, (ii) air quality management governance, (iii) \nfuel quality improvement, (iv) vehicle standards and vehicle technology, (v) inspection and \nmaintenance,  and  (vi)  transport  planning  and  traffic  management.  A  number  of  policy \ninstruments are recommended for each category. Priority activities requiring future funding are \nalso recommended. Actions for industrial air pollution control have yet to be identified and \nintegrated. ADB is also providing a regional assistance through Clean Air Initiatives\u2013Asia to help \nselected developing member countries, including Indonesia, develop a regional network to \nexchange knowledge and share information on air quality management. Through the regional \nassistance, Indonesia participated in the Forum of Development of Fuel Strategy. \n \n8.  Other international agencies have granted Indonesia TA, including the World Bank \nUrban  Air  Quality  Management  Strategy    (URBAIR)  Jakarta  Program,  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency Study on the Integrated Air Quality Management for Jakarta Metropolitan \nArea,  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  Environmental  Impact \nManagement Agency (BAPEDAL) and East Java Pollution Control Implementation Project, and \nSwisscontact vehicle inspection and maintenance. The Government has not fully taken up these \nactivities\u2019 recommendations due to the implementing agencies\u2019 weaknesses in policy integration \nand enforcement, and shortage of consistent funding and a strong coordination and monitoring \nmechanism. Therefore, a sector development program is needed to provide financing source \nand technical assistance to strengthen both the central and regional governments\u2019 capacity of \npolicy development and their enforcement infrastructure. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA\u2019s purpose is to help prepare the Program to strengthen enforcement strategies \nand the framework of urban air quality management in Indonesia. The main focus area could be  \nthe Capital City of  Jakarta (DKI Jakarta) and its neighboring regencies, or other cities that have \nserious  industrial  or  vehicular  air  pollution  problems.  The  TA  will  review  the  policy  and \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002. Clean Vehicle Fuel for Blue Skies, Part B. Manila. ", "      3   \nregulatory framework, strengthen institutional capacity, develop implementation strategies, and \nprepare an investment plan to improve infrastructure required for air quality management in the \nprogram area. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two phases in 12 months. Phase 1 will be implemented in \n5 months to prepare an air quality management strategy and action plan (SAP), which will \ninclude policy and investment actions on reducing vehicle and industrial air emissions, as the \nProgram\u2019s implementation basis. Phase 2 will be implemented in 7 months to prepare the \nProgram  based  on  the  SAP.  Five  cities  (Bandung,  Jakarta,  Jogyakarta,  Semarang,  and \nSurabaya) have been tentatively selected to be consulted during the inception stage. One or \ntwo will be selected to participate in the Program. \n \n11.  To prepare the SAP, the TA consultants will review the implementation framework and \neffectiveness of the Government\u2019s and donors\u2019 air quality management polices and programs. \nThe review will draw on findings and conclusions of previous reviews and reports, including the \npolicy paper prepared under the ADB TA on Clean Vehicle Fuel for Blue Skies and the outputs \nof  the  ADB  regional  TA  on  Clean  Air  Initiatives\u2014Asia4, which will then be discussed and \nfollowed up with the Government through policy dialogue. A time-bound policy enforcement \nframework,  including  activities  to  be  undertaken  by  each  implementing  agency,  resource \nrequirements, performance indicators, and a coordination and monitoring mechanism will be \nrecommended to strengthen urban air quality management. The SAP will also identify areas \nwhere the private sector can help improve air quality, or private pro-environmental funds can be \nmobilized for the Program. Monthly technical meetings will be held in phase 1 for stakeholders \nto discuss the SAP\u2019s preparation. A consultation conference will be held to discuss the draft \nSAP. The Government will review the draft SAP during the fifth month of phase 1. \n \n12.  Due  to  the  multisectoral  nature  of  air  quality  management,  holistic  planning  and \ncoordination capacity, which the Government lacks, is vital to the Program\u2019s success. A study \ntour in countries where air quality management is successful or in progress will be conducted \nduring phase 1 to strengthen the Government\u2019s comprehensive planning capacity. Eight senior \nofficials  of  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  MOE,  Ministry  of \nCommunication, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, and two city governments will \nattend the study tour, which is tentatively planned to include Republic of Korea; Philippines; \nand/or Taipei,China. The participants will learn air quality management strategic planning and \nenforcement skills. \n \n13.  In phase 2, a feasibility study will be conducted to prepare an investment plan for air \nquality improvement. The plan will cover all aspects related to new investments, including \ntechnology selection; technical specifications; economic and financial analyses; environment, \npoverty, and social impact assessments; and institutional strengthening to improve air quality \nmanagement. The investments may include, but not be limited to, adding new or rehabilitating \nair quality monitoring and survey equipment, and supporting capacity building and institutional \nstrengthening. The plan may also include a mechanism through financial intermediaries to \nprovide funds to the private sector to improve air quality. The funds could be used to procure air \nemission  reduction  equipment,  air  quality  monitoring  devices,  a  motor  vehicle  emission \ninspection and maintenance system, natural-gas filling stations and vehicles, and cleaner-\nproduction and energy-efficient technology to meet emission standards. Technical meetings will \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001. Regional Technical Assistance on Clean Air Initiatives Asia. Manila. \n ", " 4   \nalso  be  held  in  phase  2  to  discuss  with  concerned  agencies  the  investment  design  and \nimplementation framework. \n \n14.  An international consulting firm associated with a local firm will be engaged to help line \nministries and selected cities jointly commit to improving urban air quality. The consultants will \ndiscuss with the public and private sectors to identify potential investment needs and design \nappropriate investment components in line with SAP activities. To facilitate project preparation, \nthe consultants will examine in phase 2 the new procedure specified in Ministry of Finance \nDecree  35/2002  to  help  the  central  and  selected  city  governments  comply  with  financing \nrequirements. The consultants will also design and conduct a policy development training \nworkshop in phase 1, and an air quality management technical training workshop in phase 2 to \nstrengthen agencies\u2019 planning and enforcement capacity. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $880,000 equivalent, comprising $390,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $490,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$700,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange costs and $310,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance in kind the remaining \n$180,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The cost estimates and financing plan are \npresented in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  BAPPENAS,  through  its  Directorate  for  Environment  and  Natural  Resource \nManagement, will be the Executing Agency. The ministries of environment, energy and mineral \nresources, and communications; other concerned ministries; and selected city governments will \nbe the implementing agencies. A steering committee chaired by BAPPENAS will be set up to \ncoordinate  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  views  and  advise  the  consultants  during  TA \nimplementation. The private sector, civil society, and NGOs representatives will be invited to the \nsteering committee for extensive stakeholder consultation. \n \n17.  The TA will be carried out in two phases in 12 months, from November 2004 to October \n2005. An international consulting firm associated with a domestic consulting firm will undertake \nthe TA activities. The international and domestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Simplified technical proposals will be requested \nand evaluated using the quality- and cost-based selection method to select a consulting firm. \n \n18.  The total consulting services will include 17 person-months of international and 52 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. Phase 1 will require 6 person-months of international \nand 25 person-months of domestic consultants. Phase 2 will require 11 person-months of \ninternational and 27 person-months of domestic consultants. Expertise required includes air \nquality management policy and institution development, air quality monitoring, industrial air \npollution  control,  environmental  economics,  vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance,  transport \nplanning, fuel quality, social development, information technology and public awareness, public \nhealth,  and  government  finance  and  procurement.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  of  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. \n ", "      5   \n19.  The consultant team should have a home-base office in Jakarta to effectively and \nefficiently  communicate  and  work  closely  with  BAPPENAS  and  implementing  agencies. \nEquipment required for TA implementation will be procured by the consultant in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and retained by BAPPENAS upon TA completion. \n \n20.  The consultants will submit  (i) an inception report at the end of the first month, (ii) \nmonthly progress reports at the end of months during which no other reports are due, (iii) a first \ninterim report, including the draft SAP, in the second week of the fourth month, (iv) a second \ninterim report and a final SAP at the end of the sixth month, (v) a draft final report at the end of \ntenth  month,  and  (vi)  a  final  report  within  3  weeks  after  the  final  tripartite  meeting.  The \nconsultants  will  submit  hard  and  electronic  copies  of  all  the  reports  to  the  BAPPENAS, \nimplementing agencies, and ADB. Tripartite meetings involving the BAPPENAS, implementing \nagencies, consultants, and ADB, will be held after submission of the inception, interim, and draft \nfinal reports.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia  for  preparing  the  Urban  Air  Quality  Improvement  Sector \nDevelopment Program and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 2  \nLOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targetsa    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \nImprove urban air  \u2022  Ambient air quality meets  \u2022  Government and   \nquality   standards  stakeholder air quality \n\u2022  Industrial air emissions  reports \ncomply with standards  \u2022  Verified stack emission \n\u2022  Vehicular air emissions  testing reports of \ncomply with standards  stationary sources \n\u2022  Vehicular emission testing \nreports \n \nPurpose      Assumptions \n\u2022 Help the  \u2022 An air quality management  \u2022 Existence of the strategy  \u2022 The Government is \nGovernment  strategy and action plan is  and regulatory  strongly committed \ndevelop air quality  adopted by the  enforcement framework  to TA \nmanagement  Government after TA  \u2022 Government annual  implementation. \nstrategies and  completion  budget on air quality  \u2022 Policy incentives \nimplementation  \u2022 Government officials are  management  encourage the \nframework  trained during program  \u2022 Private sector  private sector to \n\u2022 Strengthen human  completion  expenditures on air  actively uptake the \nresources and  \u2022 Regulatory enforcement  pollution control  credit-line facility to \ninstitutional  capacity is improved after  \u2022 Publications on air quality   improve air pollution \ncapacity of air  program completion  control. \nquality  \u2022 Public awareness is raised  \u2022 Enforcement skill \nmanagement  \u2022 Air quality monitoring and  and technology of air \n\u2022 Promote public  emission testing  quality management \nand private  equipment are improved  are improved. \ninvestments in air  after program completion  \u2022 Trained government \nquality  \u2022 Installation of emission  staff stay in their \nmanagement  control facilities is  posts. \nincreased during program  \u2022 All stakeholders \nimplementation  actively participate.  \n\u2022 Public and private   \ninvestments in air quality  Risks \nmanagement increase  \u2022 The legal and \nduring program  regulatory \nimplementation  framework is not in \n  place on time. \n\u2022 Trained staff leave \ntheir posts. \nOutputs (of the TA)      Assumptions \n\u2022 An air quality  \u2022 A strategy and action plan  \u2022  TA implementation  \u2022 All stakeholders \nmanagement  prepared in the fourth  inception, progress,  actively participate. \nstrategy and action  month of TA  interim, and final reports  \u2022 The Government \nplan  implementation  \u2022 Tripartite meetings  provides \n\u2022 Improved  \u2022 An investment plan for  following submission of  counterpart staff \nhardware and  public sector, including  inception, interim and  and budget support. \nsoftware facilities  contract packages,  draft final reports  \u2022 The private sector \nfor better  bidding documents, and  supports the \nenforcement of  implementation  Program. \nand compliance  framework prepared in  Continued on next page.
