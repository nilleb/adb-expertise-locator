", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since 1978, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has helped borrowers and executing \nagencies (EAs) strengthen their capabilities to manage the implementation of projects through \nregional and country training programs on project implementation and administration. By the \nend of 2002, ADB had conducted 174 training programs under regional technical assistance \n(TA) grants. A total of 5,320 senior and middle-level officials of EAs, central ministries, and state \nbanks  from  30  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  have  participated  in  these  training \nprograms.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Two core governance activities that cut across all sectors and on which ADB will focus in \nthe medium term are capacity building and policy reform. Training programs provided under \nthis  TA1  are  part  of  a  systematic  and  long-term  approach  to  capacity  building  for  project \nimplementation in DMCs. The TA fulfills two capacity building activities: institution strengthening \nand  human  resource  development.  The  training  programs  also  indirectly  support  other \ngovernance activities such as accountability, transparency, and anticorruption efforts.  \n \n3.  Current  initiatives  to  improve  portfolio  management  emphasize  DMC  ownership  of \nprojects and capabilities for project implementation. The ability to implement projects efficiently \nand economically depends on the knowledge, skills, and experience of the staff of project EAs. \nMany DMC  personnel have acquired substantial experience in project implementation over the \nyears. However, further practical and regular training in procurement and administration of other \nproject implementation activities is needed to (i) familiarize new EAs that are entrusted with \nimplementing ADB-assisted projects and are from new borrowing member countries or DMCs \nthat may have previously borrowed from ADB, but are not yet fully familiar with the Guidelines \nfor Procurement, Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, disbursement procedures, and other \nassociated project implementation and administration procedures; and (ii) train EAs that have \nadministered ADB-assisted projects but may need to transfer and replace staff of ongoing ADB-\nassisted projects, acquire new staff for new projects, or both.  ADB needs to introduce project \nmanagers, especially those newly appointed, to the latest concepts and techniques of project \nimplementation  and  administration,  and  to  the  guidelines,  policies,  and  procedures  on \nprocurement,  consulting  services  and  disbursements;  and  to  share  with  them  the  lessons \nlearned from earlier projects.  \n \n4.  Country  portfolio  review  missions  routinely  determine  that  delays  in  project \nimplementation are, to a large extent, caused by a lack of understanding of, and unfamiliarity \nwith, ADB\u2019s requirements and guidelines. The TA training programs are designed to address \nthese deficiencies by upgrading project implementation skills of EA personnel and to improve \nfamiliarity with, and application of, the guidelines, policies, and procedures on procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursements.   \n \n5.  Evaluation  and  feedback  from  past  seminars  indicate  that  the  training  programs \nsuccessfully  strengthen participants' professional skills and increase their understanding of \nADB\u2019s requirements relating to the implementation and administration of projects. The structure \nand content of the seminars are being continually revised and improved based on suggestions \nfrom participants and in response to the changing needs of EAs and ADB. The TA framework is \npresented in Appendix 1. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 2003. ", "2 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The seminars in the program will provide project directors, managers, and other key staff \nof EAs with an understanding of modern principles and techniques of project management and \nimplementation,  and  will  familiarize  them  with  ADB's  guidelines  and  procedures  for  the \nprocurement of goods and works, selection and engagement of consultants, disbursements, \nand other associated activities. The seminars will also provide the trainees with a valuable \nopportunity  to  share  with  and  learn  from  the  experience  of  participants  from  other  sector \norganizations within a DMC or, in the case of regional seminars, from other DMCs within the \nregion, thereby supporting regional cooperation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Two regional and eight country seminars on project implementation and administration \nwill be conducted during June 2003 to May 2004.  \n \n8.  One regional seminar will be held at ADB's headquarters in Manila and the other in one \nof the Central Asian Republic countries. The regional seminars follow in principle the same \nformat as the country seminars.   The only difference is that, due to the availability of ADB staff, \nadditional presentations are offered during the regional seminar at ADB headquarters. The \nregional seminar at ADB Headquarters will last 10 days while the regional seminar for the \nCentral Asian Republics will be for 9 days.  Newly appointed project directors and senior policy-\nmakers of central agencies will be selected to form the target group. \n \n9.  The eight country seminars, each of which will last 9 days, will address and take place at \nthe country level. In general, the seminars will cover a broad range of activities related to project \nimplementation.  \n \n10.  The country seminars are envisaged for the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, \nIndia,  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  Nepal,  Pakistan,    Philippines,  and  Viet  Nam. \nCountries  selected  include  (i)  DMCs  in  which  loans  approved  in  2002  involved  new \nimplementing  EAs,  (ii) DMCs  receiving  a  large  number  of  loans  annually,  (iii)  DMCs  that \nrequested inclusion, and (iv) DMCs that Country Portfolio Review Missions determined to need \nthe seminar.   The scope and content of the country seminars will be similar to those of the \nregional seminars (para. 8). Cross-cutting issues will be covered but only in general terms \nbecause of constraints in arranging for staff specialists to travel to the selected DMCs. The \ntarget group will consist of project managers and middle-level project staff.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, which will support the two \nregional and eight country seminars. The detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2. This \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA-funding program. \n ", "    3 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The  Central  Operations  Services  Office  will  implement  the  TA.  Nominations  of \nparticipants  will  be  solicited  from  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  administering  ADB-funded \nprojects in the selected DMCs.   A list of ADB-recommended nominees will then be submitted to \nthe governments for their consideration and endorsement.   Letters of no objection from each of \nthe DMCs will be obtained prior to initiation of the TA in the DMC. \n \n13.  The seminars will focus on the responsibilities of project managers to plan, organize, \nprovide  resources,  budget,  schedule,  direct,  monitor,  control,  and  evaluate  project \nimplementation. The program will follow the sample seminar outline shown in Appendix 3. The \nmethods of instruction will include lectures, case studies, class exercises, and workshops. The \nseminars will be carried out in the English language.  For the country seminars, the resource \npersons may be assisted by interpreters where necessary. The lectures will deal with project \nimplementation concepts and systems, including explanations for adapting them to the local \nsetting. The case studies will analyze problem situations and the decision-making process. The \nexercises will test and reinforce the participants' abilities to apply implementation tools and \ntechniques in relation to the types of projects assisted by ADB. An important feature of each \nseminar will be a workshop on the problems and issues the participants have encountered in \ntheir projects.  \n \n14.  Invitations will be extended to project directors and managers, and to other key staff \nfrom the EAs of ADB-assisted projects. As far as possible, they will be drawn from projects that \nare  at  the  inception  stage.  Selected  policy-makers  from  central  agencies  involved  in  the \nformulation of financial and procurement regulations will be encouraged to participate.   About \n40 participants for each regional seminar and 30 participants for each country seminar will be \nselected in consultation with ADB's regional departments and resident and regional missions.   \nAll of the seminars will be held during June 2003 to May 2004. The resource persons for the \ncountry  and  regional  seminars  will  be  ADB  staff,  particularly  procurement  and  consulting \nservices  specialists  from  Central  Projects  Services  Office  and  staff  from  the  Controller\u2019s \nDepartment.  \n \nIII.
