THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nPT Geo Dipa Energi (GDE), to be guaranteed by the Republic of Indonesia, for the Geothermal \nPower Generation Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a loan to be \nprovided by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) for the Geothermal Power Generation Project,1 \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the CTF loan. \n \n2.  The project will support the expansion of Indonesia\u2019s geothermal generating capacity to \ncontribute to the sustainability, resiliency, and sufficiency of the electricity system. It is aligned \nwith the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 7 on access to affordable, \nreliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all and SDG 13 on urgent action to combat climate \nchange and its impacts. The project will support GDE, a state-owned geothermal company \nfocused on the development and use of geothermal resources, to commission an additional \n110 megawatts  (MW)  of  geothermal  electricity  generating  capacity\u201455  MW  at  the  Dieng \ngeothermal field in Central Java and 55 MW at the Patuha geothermal field in West Java.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector status and projections. The Electricity Power Supply Business Plan, 2019\u20132028 \n(RUPTL) of the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) projects demand for electricity to grow to \n112.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2028.3 As of December 2018, Indonesia\u2019s total power generation \ncapacity was about 65 GW, of which 41 GW was owned by PLN, 15 GW was contracted from \nindependent power producers, and 9 GW was from captive power generators. More than half of \nIndonesia\u2019s current power generating capacity uses coal; if this continues, it will be challenging \nfor Indonesia to meet its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target of 29% by 2030 \ncompared with business as usual.4 Part of the contribution to Indonesia\u2019s climate mitigation target \nwill come from renewable energy capacity contributions to total electricity generation, for which \nthe RUPTL sets a target of 23.2% in 2028, up from 11.4% in 2019. In addition to climate benefits, \nincreasing renewable energy\u2019s share in the power mix will improve air quality, the adverse impacts \nof which disproportionately impact the poor, making them more vulnerable to other stressors.  \n \n4.  Geothermal energy strategy and challenges. Geothermal energy is one of the few \nrenewable energy technologies that can provide baseload power and improve power system \nreliability, making it a valuable complement to variable renewable energy such as wind and solar \npower. Indonesia has the world\u2019s largest geothermal potential, estimated at 29 GW and has the \nsecond  largest  installed  capacity  after  the  United  States.  The  government  has  prioritized \n \n1  The CTF is a funding window for the Climate Investment Funds that provides middle-income and developing \ncountries with resources to scale up the demonstration, deployment, and transfer of low-carbon, clean technologies. \n2  These are net generating capacities. \n3  Government of Indonesia. 2019. Keputusan Menteri ESDM No 39/K/20/MEM/2019 Rencana Usaha Penyediaan \ntentang Listrik (RUPTL) 2019\u20132028 (Decree of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources No. 39 / K / 20 / MEM \n/ 2019 concerning Electricity Supply Business Plans (RUPTL) 2019\u20132028). Jakarta. \n4  Indonesia\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement include reducing GHGs by \n29% by 2030 (up to 41% with international support) and call for integrating resilience measures in all development \nplans and projects, given the country\u2019s vulnerability to hydro-meteorological hazards, which are exacerbated by \nclimate change. Priority resilience measures include securing energy, food, water, social welfare, and livelihoods by \ndeveloping renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and climate-resilient infrastructure. \n ", "2 \ngeothermal since enactment of the Geothermal Law in 2003, but development has been slow to \ntake off. Development rights have been allocated for geothermal working areas with an estimated \naggregate potential of 4.4 GW. Of these, private sector developers hold the development rights \nfor 2.4 GW and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) hold the rights for 2.0 GW. As of mid-2019, \nIndonesia had reached only 1.9 GW of installed geothermal capacity, which is less than half of \nthe allocated rights and significantly short of the targeted 7.2 GW by 2025 (footnote 3). \n \n5.  To reach the required scale, the private sector must play a strong role in geothermal \ndevelopment. Indonesia has had some success with private sector-led geothermal projects, \nincluding those supported by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Private Sector Operations \nDepartment.5 However, many privately held concession areas have not advanced because of \nenvironmental, social, or fiscal issues, and private sector interest in recent tenders has been \nmodest. A variety of challenges face the sector, including the costly, lengthy, and high-risk \nexploration phase; unstable policy environment; and an often-unfavorable tariff regime. Private \nsector interest and available financing is now further challenged by uncertainties arising from the \nglobal pandemic, with an unclear timeline for investor appetite to return.  \n \n6.  Development partners are supporting the government to establish a more conducive \npolicy environment for geothermal development. ADB has been an active participant in these \nefforts, in particular through the recent policy-based lending program.6 To reduce the up-front \nrisks associated with geothermal exploration, the government is implementing a new risk-sharing \nmechanism for the project initiation phase, funded by the World Bank and the Green Climate \nFund. As part of this program, the government will fund exploratory drilling for geothermal working \nareas  that  can  subsequently  be  tendered.  The  updated  geothermal  regulation  allows  for \ngreenfield geothermal working areas to be assigned to SOEs if the tender process fails.7 Legacy \nprojects where both private and public sector developers have grandfathered power purchase \nagreements (PPAs) are expected to proceed under the agreed mechanism and ownership.    \n \n7.  History and planned developments of PT Geo Dipa Energi. GDE was formed in 2002 \nas a joint venture company of Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas corporation, and PLN to \nmanage and develop the geothermal working areas at Dieng and Patuha, which are among the \n2 GW of working areas allocated for SOE development. GDE negotiated a PPA with PLN in 2004 \nfor both sites, covering the generation of up to 400 MW at each. In 2011, the government \nreorganized GDE from a joint venture to a limited liability company and took over the 67% of \nshares owned by Pertamina. Government equity injections have increased its shareholding to \n93.3%, while PLN holds 6.7%. GDE operates a 55 MW power plant at Dieng (Dieng Unit 1) and \na 55 MW power plant at Patuha (Patuha Unit 1). It started operations by recommissioning Dieng \nUnit 1, which was initially commissioned by the private sector and then turned over to the \ngovernment  after  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis.  GDE  subsequently  constructed  and \ncommissioned Patuha Unit 1 in 2014, which is fed by previously drilled wells. Under the proposed \nproject, GDE plans to commission additional units at Dieng and Patuha (Dieng Unit 2 and Patuha \nUnit 2). These are government priority projects (according to the Regulation of the Ministry of \nEnergy and Mineral Resources No. 40 [2014]) and PLN will purchase the electricity generated \n \n5  ADB. 2018.

Separate from this project, GDE will conduct exploratory drilling on \nbehalf of the government, under the new risk-sharing program (para. 6), for sites to be tendered. \nIn addition, GDE will develop geothermal sites for which it holds the development rights in areas \nthat are less attractive to private investment because of environmental and social risks. \n \n8.  The  project  will  add  renewable  energy  baseload  generation  in  Java  by  expanding \ngeothermal power generation to reduce Indonesia\u2019s reliance on coal. It will contribute to reaching \nIndonesia\u2019s renewable energy targets and reducing GHG emissions in Indonesia and globally. \nJava has the country\u2019s largest electricity demand but is the most challenging for renewable energy \nbecause of low average generating costs from low-cost coal-based electricity generation, against \nwhich renewable energy must compete.8 The project will support capacity development of GDE, \nincluding  increased  knowledge  of  geothermal  reservoir  performance,  contract  and  project \nmanagement, and social and environmental impact minimization and management\u2014all with \ngender and climate resilience considerations. It will also support GDE to enhance its community \ndevelopment  programs  to  be more  strategic  in  responding  to  community needs,  including \nwomen\u2019s  needs.  The  strong  emphasis  on  environmental  and  social  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement reflects lessons learned from previous energy sector projects in Indonesia, where \nsuch issues have impeded efficient and sustainable project development. The enhancement of \nGDE\u2019s institutional capacity will better equip it to undertake government-supported drilling to bring \nin the necessary private sector investment and set a proven standard for safeguard management, \nincluding for geothermal areas to be newly developed. \n  \n9.  Alignment. The project is aligned with Indonesia\u2019s long-term goals for economic growth \nand energy as articulated in the Draft National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN), \n2020\u2013 2024 and the National Energy Policy.9,10 These goals include maximizing the use of \nindigenous energy resources, diversifying the fuel mix, and ensuring environmental sustainability. \nADB\u2019s energy sector support, as outlined in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Indonesia, is \naligned with these long-term goals, with a focus on policy reforms, developing sustainable \nelectricity generation, and grid investments.11 The project is also aligned with several operational \npriorities of Strategy 2030 (Table 1).12 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Project\u2019s Contributions \nTackling climate change,  Support increased use of low greenhouse gas-emitting electricity \nbuilding climate and disaster  generation in line with the government\u2019s international commitments. \nresilience, and enhancing  Adopt an eco-sensitive and climate-resilient approach to project \nenvironmental sustainability  planning and implementation. \nStrengthening governance  Strengthen GDE\u2019s capacity to conduct competitive procurement and \nand institutional capacity  promote enhanced financial management capabilities. \nAccelerating progress in  Incorporate proactive gender designs in human resources practices \ngender equality  and community engagement and development activities. \nGDE = PT Geo Dipa Energi. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n8  The 2018, average kWh power costs in West and Central Java, the location of the proposed projects, was 6.91 US \ncents, as compared to 17.58-21.28 US cents in Flores, another region with active geothermal development.  \n9 Government of Indonesia.

While the project was planned before the coronavirus pandemic, it \nwas negotiated after its onset, clearly signaling the government\u2019s sustained commitment to its \nclimate ambitions. Engagement from the ADB in the project at this juncture is critical, as Indonesia \naddresses  the  pandemic\u2019s  impact  on  the  economy.  Institutions  such  as  the  International \nRenewable  Energy  Agency,13  and  the  International  Energy  Agency  have  called  for  post-\ncoronavirus investments to ensure a climate-conscious recovery.14 ADB\u2019s intervention will help \nmake a clean energy transition a key part of Indonesia\u2019s recovery, and the project will provide \njobs for those supplying goods and services for the geothermal, oil, and gas industries, which \nhave been impacted by the drop in oil demand due to quarantine conditions. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) contribution to geothermal energy in \nIndonesian power supply increased (footnote 3), and (ii) renewable energy in electricity subsector \nincreased.15 The project will have the following outcome: adequacy and sustainability of energy \nsupply increased.16 \n \n12.  Output 1: Geothermal power plants constructed and commissioned. The project will \nsupport GDE in constructing and commissioning a 55 MW geothermal power plant at Dieng, \nCentral Java Province (Dieng Unit 2) and a 55 MW geothermal power plant at Patuha, West Java \nprovince (Patuha Unit 2). Both Dieng Unit 2 and Patuha Unit 2 will include (i) the drilling of new \nwells for the production and reinjection of reservoir fluids, and (ii) the construction of an above-\nground steam gathering system and fluid reinjection lines connecting the wells and generating \nunits. Patuha Unit 2 will be a single-flash power plant, and Dieng Unit 2 will be a geothermal \ncombined cycle plant.17 The project will also support the transmission interconnection systems \nbetween the plants and the grid. At Dieng, this will include the commissioning of a new, \n6- kilometer underground transmission line to the Dieng substation. Existing lines and towers will \nbe used to connect Patuha Unit 2 to the Patuha substation, but the project will include the \ninstallation of a new transformer at the existing substation. \n \n13.  Output 2: Institutional capacity of GDE strengthened. The project will strengthen \nGDE\u2019s  capacity  to  plan  for,  develop,  and  operate  geothermal  power  plants,  including  the \nmanagement of complex technical conditions and multiple contracts with coordinated activities. \nThis  will  be  done  through  gender-responsive  training  programs,  organized  by  the  loan \nconsultants, on reservoir management and procurement; and on-the-job training, supported by \nthe project management consultant (PMC), on meeting ADB procurement, financial management, \nand reporting requirements. GDE will also increase its ability to manage environmental and social \nrisks by implementing a revised environmental management system (EMS), which will incorporate \ngender, climate, and community safety considerations. \n \n \n13  International Renewable Energy Agency. 2020.

Jakarta.   \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17 The wells will produce reservoir fluids that are a mixture of steam and water. In a single-flash steam power plant, the \nsteam is separated and used as the working fluid for the power plant, while the water is unused and reinjected in the \nreservoir along with the condensate from the steam cycle. In a combined cycle plant, the steam and water are still \nseparated, but the heat energy from the steam is used twice, and the heat energy from the water is used once before \nreinjection. The steam will first go through a steam turbine, after which it will go through a heat exchanger where the \nresidual heat in the steam will be transferred to an organic fluid that will power another turbine. The water will also \ngo through a heat exchanger, where the heat is transferred to an organic fluid that will power another turbine.  \n ", "5 \n14.  Output 3: Community development program enhanced. The project will support the \nenhancement  of  GDE\u2019s  Community  Development  Program.18  This  will  begin  with  the \nimplementation of a gender-responsive stakeholder communication strategy,19 which will involve \n(i) increased outreach and education on the project and its impacts; and (ii) information gathering \non the communities\u2019 challenges, including the differential needs and experiences of men and \nwomen. Improved communication will help address misperceptions around the existing power \nplants and planned development; this is particularly important at Dieng, where communities live \nand farm close to the project sites. Based on community feedback on key challenges and needs, \nthe community development program will refocus on actions that will contribute most meaningfully \nto the improved well-being of the men and women in the project communities, e.g., a stronger \nemphasis on alternative livelihood opportunities and addressing challenges such as access to \neducation  (through  scholarships),  water  strain,  and  declining  agricultural  production.  The \nimproved  communication  and  more  strategic  focus  of  programs  to  benefit  neighboring \ncommunities will strengthen their relationship with GDE and their support for the project. The PMC \nwill also develop a feasibility study for a geothermal direct-use project, such as use of geothermal \nheat for drying of agricultural products or heating dwellings for tourism homestays, which could \nprovide enhanced livelihood opportunities for community members. This direct-use project could \nbe implemented as part of the Community Development Program, in parallel with the development \nof Dieng Unit 3. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s engagement in this project supports strengthened governance and institutional \ncapacity of GDE, an SOE that can play a catalytic role in the next wave of geothermal expansion \nin  Indonesia.  GDE  will  gain  experience  in  project  and  contract  management,  particularly \ncompetitive tendering and effective management of multiple synchronous contracts (para. 26), \nwhich will be necessary as it undertakes future exploratory drilling for the government and will act \nas benchmarks for evaluation of IPP proposals. ADB\u2019s engagement during the design phase \nresulted in GDE adopting design changes to address operational challenges experienced at the \nexisting facilities and introducing best international practice design (para. 21) and sustainability \nplanning (para. 24). The project design will minimize environmental, climate, and social risks, \nwhile ADB\u2019s sustained engagement will support GDE to manage residual risks. ADB will also \nsupport  GDE  to  (i)  ensure  gender-sensitive  approaches  in  its  human  resources  and \ncommunication activities and (ii) enhance its community development program to meet the needs \nof the communities suffering from overreliance on agricultural activities and challenges caused \nby water strain. GDE\u2019s increased experience in designing and developing projects that minimize \nsocial and environmental risks and maximize social and gender benefits will provide a model for \ngeothermal projects in Indonesia that could be adopted by both private- and SOE-led geothermal \nprojects. This ADB support through and after the global pandemic contributes to a sustainable \nand resilient economic recovery.  \n  \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $469.20 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).20 \n \n18 GDE\u2019s Community Development Program is a corporate social responsibility program through which it undertakes \nactivities to benefit communities in the areas surrounding GDE operations.

Numerical modeling of the reservoirs \ndemonstrates the capacity to supply steam to the existing and additional plants for their design \nlife. The steam turbine technology to be used for Patuha Unit 2 is based on technology that has \nbeen in use for decades, and is similar to that of Patuha Unit 1, which has been in operation for \nabout 5 years. Several international manufacturers are capable of supplying power plants to the \nrequired level of quality and reliability. The steam system supplying the new plant will be designed \nto the same operating conditions as the existing plant to provide operational flexibility. \n \n \n21 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n22.  The existing plant at Dieng (Dieng Unit 1) has had operational challenges, resulting in \nsignificant mineral deposition in production and reinjection wells, surface piping, and the plant. As \na result, the operations of Dieng Unit 1 have been affected, and, at times, the plant has only been \nable to operate at about 50% of its rated capacity. Studies undertaken during the feasibility study \nphase have concluded that the traditional steam turbine-based plant and operating conditions \nselected for Dieng Unit 1 were not appropriate. The Dieng Unit 2 expansion will be based on a \nplant configuration known as a geothermal combined cycle plant, which consists of a conventional \nsteam turbine and an Organic Rankine Cycle plant\u2014extracting energy from both steam and liquid \nbrine streams produced from the reservoir. Combined cycle plants of this type have been \noperating in a number of geothermal projects for more than 30 years and are well proven in this \nenvironment. In addition to offering Dieng improved performance and reliability, the combined \ncycle plant will offer improved thermal efficiency compared with the technology used for Dieng \nUnit 1. The operation of the brine disposal system to be used for Dieng Unit 2 will be new to GDE \nand will require training in both operation and maintenance to be successful. Various programs \nare planned to train GDE staff (Output 2), starting with a training program as part of pilot plant \ntrials, which will be undertaken in 2020 to confirm plant design parameters. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n23.  The project\u2019s economic viability was assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects.22 A with- and without-project framework was adopted, and \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of Patuha Unit 2 and Dieng Unit 2 were measured \nagainst an assumed hurdle rate of 9.0%, and the sensitivity to adverse changes in the underlying \nassumptions was also assessed. Each subproject is economically viable, and the combined EIRR \nis 13.0%, which exceeds the economic hurdle rate. Economic benefits are derived from the \nincremental and non-incremental output of the geothermal plants to meet additional demand and \ndisplace thermal generation. The basis for the valuation of these benefits was the consumers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay and the avoided cost of thermal fuel stock. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates \nthat the expected economic performance is robust. \n \n24.  The Project is financially viable, with a financial internal rate of return of 5.8%, which is \nhigher than the 2.3% (real) weighted average cost of capital. A sensitivity analysis showed the \nproject to be robust with the financial internal rate of return exceeding the weighted average cost \nof capital under all scenarios, including a 20.0% increase in capital costs.23 However, with the \ncurrent tariff in the PPA, the project would not be viable under commercial financing terms. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n25.  Project planning has considered the actions and resources required to sustain the project \noutcome throughout the project life. At the technical level, these include planning for additional \ninvestments, such as drilling of makeup production wells during operation and capacity building \nfor GDE in geothermal reservoir management. Significant additional efforts are also under way to \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity.  GDE  has  done  a  staffing  analysis  in  planning  for  the \nestablishment of the project management unit to ensure that sufficient permanent staff are hired \nto support the operations of the power plants after commissioning. In addition, the capacity of \nboth the project management unit and corporate staff in financial management, procurement and \ncontract management, and overall project management will be strengthened. The project is \nassessed as financially viable and is expected to generate strong positive cash flows to support \n \n22 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n23 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ncapital investment, debt servicing, and maintenance expenditures. Therefore, the project will \npositively  contribute  to  GDE\u2019s  long-term  financial  sustainability.  The  project  design  has \nincorporated adaptation measures to address identified climate vulnerabilities and the project will \ncontribute to climate change mitigation over the project\u2019s life (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  GDE has limited experience of managing externally financed projects and will require \nsignificant support from the PMC to implement the project. GDE is still enhancing its procurement \nand contract management capacity and will benefit from the formal training programs and on-the-\njob training provided by the PMC. Enhancement of GDE\u2019s financial management, procurement, \nand contract management capacity will help GDE in executing this and future projects. ADB \nsupport to strengthen GDE\u2019s capacity in these areas is consistent with the government\u2019s efforts \nto promote good corporate governance, transparency, and accountability across SOEs. \n \n27.  GDE developed standard procurement procedures following those of PLN and carried out \nstrategic  procurement  planning  to  ensure  that  appropriate,  fit-for-purpose  procurement \napproaches  achieve  value  for  money  and  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives.  Contract \npackaging of drilling works reflects the most appropriate contract sizes and procurement methods, \nin line with the strategic priorities of GDE to meet the project schedule and to lower the dispute \nrisk among contractors and suppliers during drilling operations. The market assessment confirms \nan adequate number of international and national suppliers. Contractors for geothermal power \nplant projects in Indonesia are international and national companies. \n \n28.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Guidance Note on Financial Management Assessment,24 and Financial Due Diligence: \nA Methodology Note.25 The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial \nmainly because of the untested capacity of GDE\u2019s finance and accounting staff to manage the \nproject\u2019s  scale  and  complexity,  the  absence  of  a  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risk \nmanagement policy, GDE\u2019s unaudited corporate financial model, and inexperience in borrowing \nfrom and reporting to multilateral development banks. However, GDE has strong oversight, \nsupported by a clear legislative framework, an internal audit function with direct reporting to the \nboard  of  commissioners,  policy  and  procedure  manuals  for  all  financial  operations,  and \ncomprehensive enterprise resource planning software. GDE has agreed to implement an action \nplan with key measures to address the identified risks, which will be a first step in building its \ncapacity to borrow on a commercial basis.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and GDE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. Integrity due diligence was conducted.26 No significant integrity risks \nwere identified with GDE.  \n \n   \n \n24 ADB. 2015.

Electricity  supply  is  essential  for  economic  growth,  which  can  reduce  poverty  and \nunemployment. This can create better income-generating opportunities for poor households. \nGiven  that  higher-value  income  generation  hinges  on  the  use  of  electricity,  the  project's \ncontribution to reliable and stable electricity supply will support economic activities for large \nindustries, small and medium-sized enterprises, and households and community-level facilities \n(e.g., clinics, schools); and provide increased opportunities for employment in project areas. The \nproject will also create substantial domestic employment opportunities for skilled labor.  \n \n31.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has been \ndeveloped  based  on a  gender analysis  and  community  consultations.27  The  plan  includes \nmeasures to ensure that long-term benefits accrue to both women and men: (i) increased job \nopportunities for women with both contractors and GDE, (ii) participation of women in capacity-\nbuilding  activities  and  the  incorporation  of  gender  responsiveness  in  corporate  plans  and \nstrategies, (iii) implementation of an enhanced livelihood program for women in surrounding \ncommunities and a commitment to direct a portion of the community development program budget \nto support women\u2019s livelihoods and scholarships, and (iv) development of a direct-use geothermal \nstrategy that maximizes opportunities for women and youth. \n \nG.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 All safeguard documents were prepared based on meaningful \nconsultations with affected persons and communities, endorsed by GDE, and disclosed on the \nADB website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy.  \n \n33.  Environment (category B). Initial environmental examination reports were prepared for \nthe proposed facilities in Dieng and Patuha.29 These reports, supplemented by independent \nstudies,30 conclude that the project will extend existing facilities located in built-up and agricultural \nareas and is not anticipated to result in impacts that are significant or unprecedented. During \nconstruction,  localized  temporary  direct  impacts  will  include  ground  surface  disturbances, \nincreased dust and noise levels, occupational and community health safety risks, a significant \ntemporary increase in water usage for well drilling, temporary traffic disturbance, and waste \ndisposal.  These  and  other  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through  measures  presented  in  the \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs). Biodiversity action plans prepared for both sites have \nidentified measures to avoid and mitigate adverse impacts on the natural habitat and important \necology. Facility operation is not expected to cause significant adverse impacts. Noise and air \nquality impact forecasts confirm compliance with relevant ambient air quality standards at the \nnearest sensitive receptors. Significant incremental operational and community safety risks are \nnot anticipated. An independent assessment confirmed that both facilities have a certified EMS \n \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB.

These systems will be \nextended to the new facilities to be supported by the project. Minor gaps identified in the current \nEMS at existing well pads and the steam above-ground gathering system will be addressed \nthrough a corrective action plan, which is included in the EMP. \n \n34.  GDE will be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the EMP and has \ncommitted to provide adequate environmental management capacity, both at its head office and \nthe two site offices in Dieng and Patuha. Community members will observe the environmental \nsampling  activities  of  licensed  third-party  laboratories.  Consultation  with  stakeholders  and \naffected  persons  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation  and  will  be  continued  during \nimplementation. Project-related complaints will be addressed in a timely manner through a joint \nsocial and environmental safeguards grievance redress mechanism (GRM). The GRM will be \ncoordinated by the GDE head office, and GDE will have GRM coordinators at the site offices. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The social impact assessment at Dieng Unit 2 \nidentified a total of 106 persons (29 households) that will be directly affected and four lease \ncoordinators (21 persons), who manage the farmers\u2019 leases, that will be indirectly affected by the \nproject. The resettlement plan documents the assessed impacts and mitigation measures.32 Of \nthe affected persons at Dieng, 86 are considered to be severely affected by the project and 47 are \nconsidered vulnerable. No significant changes to land requirements are expected during the \nconstruction of Dieng Unit 2, but any changes will be reflected in an updated resettlement plan. \nPatuha Unit 2 will be built mostly within GDE\u2019s existing premises but requires an additional \n7.2 hectares (ha) of land. Some of this (2.6 ha) is located in a forest area that is not used by the \ncommunity. GDE is processing a forestry land use permit for this land and will be required to \nprovide forestry land replacement. Once identified, GDE will prepare a resettlement plan in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for this forestry land replacement. The \nremaining 4.6 ha required for Patuha Unit 2 is within a tea plantation area, and GDE is processing \na lease extension to secure its use. The Patuha Unit 2 due diligence report documents the \nassessments and mitigation measures.33 The PMC will increase GDE knowledge on social \nsafeguards during project implementation to ensure smooth and effective application of social \nsafeguards. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The due diligence confirmed that the project is not \nexpected to have any impact on indigenous peoples, as project sites are not in areas with \nprevalent indigenous communities. It will not directly or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, \nlivelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples or affect the territories of natural or cultural \nresources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as their ancestral domain. \n \nH.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.  The  overall  project  risk  is  moderate.  Significant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 5 and described further in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \n \n \n \n31Relevant  certifications  are  the  standard  of  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  that  specifies \nrequirements for an effective EMS (ISO 14001:2015) and the Government Regulation 50/2012 regarding Application \nof Management System for Work Safety and Health (SMK3 PP No. 50/2012). \n32 Resettlement Plan: Dieng 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Due Diligence Report: Patuha 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nWater scarcity in Dieng may affect drilling  The use of condensate water from Dieng Unit 1 as the main \noperations  water source for well drilling provides an innovative \nalternative that enables continuous drilling operations \nwithout impacting drilling performance or rig reliability. \nOperation and maintenance cost higher  Pilot plant testing to confirm plant design parameters before \nthan expected because of mineral  the power plant engineering, procurement, and construction \ndeposition or high corrosion rates in  contract is issued for bid. \nDieng surface facilities and wells \nRisk of unsynchronized drilling activities  Hiring full-time and contracted staff with relevant \nbecause of lack of experience of GDE  experience, and engagement of a PMC to support \nstaff in managing drilling contracts  contracting and project management oversight. \nLimited procurement capacity of GDE to  Additional staff allocated following the resource \nmanage multiple bidding activities  enhancement plan; extensive PMC support in procurement; \nsimultaneously  procurement training and clinics by ADB to train existing \nand new GDE staff on ADB requirements. \nCorporate financial performance  Capital expenditure estimates reviewed by international \ncompromised if project is delayed or  experts and validated by market soundings.
