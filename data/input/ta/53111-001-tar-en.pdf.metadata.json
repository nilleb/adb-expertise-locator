INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide capacity building and \nadvice and will support coordinated efforts to lower the immediate barriers to cross-border \nlivestock trade and tourism cooperation between Timor-Leste and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) in \nIndonesia. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with operational priority 7 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nStrategy 2030 as it looks at opportunities to reduce spatial inequality in lagging border regions \nthrough an economic corridor approach.1 It also lays the foundation for new lending operations to \nboost regional cooperation and integration in Indonesia and Timor-Leste. The TA is included in \nthe Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s 2019 results-based work plan.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The TA is needed to seize the opportunities and tackle the challenges identified in the \nScoping Study on Enhanced Cross-Border Cooperation and Integration between Indonesia and \nTimor-Leste.3 The Government of Indonesia requested the scoping study to support a national \npolicy of development from the margins, specifically to tackle inequality and poverty in border \nareas, since NTT is Indonesia\u2019s second-poorest province.4 The border between NTT and Timor-\nLeste is particularly important as a place of previous conflict, but which nonetheless maintains \nprofound  personal  relationships.5  The  Government  of  Timor-Leste  requested  the  study  in \npreparation for joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and as part of its \nbroader strategic goals of economic growth and diversification away from its dependence on oil.6 \n \n4.  Opportunities.  The  scoping  study  highlights  several  opportunities  for  cross-border \ncooperation, but tourism and livestock are the two areas with the greatest potential. In the seven \ndistricts along the land border between NTT and Timor-Leste, 90% of households engage in \nsmallholder livestock raising, making it critical for livelihoods. Robust livestock demand in NTT \nand Timor-Leste indicates market potential for the trade of cattle from Timor-Leste to Indonesia \nand an expansion of poultry trade from NTT to Timor-Leste.7 Tourism is also an important and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and Pacific. Manila. \nOperational priority 7 focuses on fostering regional cooperation and integration. An economic corridor approach is \nthe promotion of wider economic benefits along transport corridors to transform them into economic corridors. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 June 2019. \n3  ADB conducted the study from 2017 to 2018 under TA 9350: Implementing the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nOperational Plan. The specific opportunities and challenges to address were further refined based on consultations \nwith stakeholders after the completion of the report, specifically at a joint meeting between Indonesia and Timor-\nLeste in Bali on 28\u201329 March 2019. \n4 Indonesia\u2019s commitment to develop border areas was included in the National Medium-Term Development Plan, \n2015-2019 (Government of Indonesia. 2015. Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, 2015\u20132019. \nJakarta). \n5  Timor-Leste was the 27th province of Indonesia from 1975 to 1999. This period and the years following Timor-Leste\u2019s \nself-determination were marked by violence and conflict. \n6  Timor-Leste applied for ASEAN membership in 2011, and Indonesia has been a strong advocate for its membership. \nTimor-Leste\u2019s Strategic Development Plan (Government of Timor-Leste. 2011. Timor-Leste Strategic Development \nPlan, 2011\u20132030.Dili) promotes economic growth of non-oil sectors to diversify the economy. \n7  In 2017, Indonesia imported $500.0 million worth of live cattle largely from Australia, and Timor-Leste imported \n$13.7 million worth of poultry largely from Brazil, which demonstrates the strength of domestic consumer demand. \n ", "2 \ngrowing income generator for NTT and Timor-Leste,8 offering potential for expansion by building \non the success of nearby Bali and cross-border tourism.9 \n \n5.  Challenges. Despite these opportunities, several challenges reduce or eliminate the \npotential gains for the livelihoods of people in NTT and Timor-Leste. One of the most pressing \ncrosscutting challenges is a poor aviation policy environment that reduces connectivity and raises \nticket prices. Lack of agreements on the movement of vehicles across the land border makes \nprocedures burdensome and lengthy. Furthermore, time release studies revealed that land border \nprocedures are not standardized or harmonized, leading to higher costs and time delays that are \ndetrimental  to  the  trade  of  perishable  items  such  as  agricultural  produce.10  Also,  many \nnationalities cannot obtain a visa on arrival at the land borders to Timor-Leste, and Indonesians \nmust pay an entry fee. These issues increase cross-border tourism costs. Long-term problems \ninclude the quality of the road corridors between NTT and Timor-Leste and the lack of rest stops \nand viewing areas for tourists.11 Timor-Leste\u2019s port infrastructure is also unsuitable for cruise \ntourism. \n \n6.  NTT and Timor-Leste have developed their own tourism brands but have limited marketing \nresources. Moreover, their marketing efforts are in direct competition because they offer similar \nattractions. Long-term challenges include a lack of basic amenities, accommodation options, and \nfacilities for tourism, particularly community-based tourism. Tourism skills are also limited in the \nworkforce. \n \n7.  In 2005, Timor-Leste banned poultry imports from NTT following an outbreak of avian \ninfluenza in other parts of Indonesia. No cases of avian influenza were reported in NTT, and \nTimor-Leste in 2018 permitted limited exports from one NTT business certified as free from \ninfluenza. Nevertheless, without certification that NTT as a whole is free from avian influenza, \nother poultry producers in NTT are excluded from trade.12 Indonesia banned imports of cattle from \nTimor-Leste in 2010, citing animal health concerns, particularly foot and mouth disease (FMD) \nand brucellosis. Timor-Leste has had no reported cases of FMD but requires official FMD-free \nstatus from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to enable future trade. Both NTT and \nTimor-Leste are affected by brucellosis, but the prevalence is higher in Timor-Leste, which \ncontributes to the trade ban. While animal health risks from trade are low, support for official \ncertification and recognition of such low risks is required. \n \n8.  Livestock trade is also hindered by low productivity and poor animal health regimes \nbecause livestock producers lack access to inputs such as medicine and feed, to advisory \nservices (extension and veterinary), and more broadly to financial and insurance services. Other \nunderlying issues include poor rural road networks that reduce access to markets, incomplete \nlegal frameworks for animal health, and lack of facilities and staff capacity for animal testing. \n \n                                                \n8  A 2014 survey estimated that tourism contributes $14 million to Timor-Leste\u2019s economy each year, making it the \nsecond-largest non-oil contributor to the economy after coffee exports. Visitors to NTT increased by 28% from 2012 \nto 2016 and brought an estimated $80 million from tourism-related expenditures. \n9  Bali receives 5 million visitors each year and has good air connectivity with Kupang in NTT and Dili in Timor-Leste. \n10 Time release studies were conducted under TA 8674: Trade and Transport Facilitation in the Pacific, in Timor-Leste \nand in NTT as part of the scoping study. \n11 The road standard is adequate for current traffic and vehicles but would need upgrading with higher volumes of traffic \nor larger or heavier vehicles. These will become a higher priority once the volume of trade increases.  \n12 Broiler production in NTT expanded 10-fold from 2015 to 2016, but only one business has permission to export. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The objective of this TA will be to deal with the most immediate policy and capacity \nchallenges described in paras. 5\u20138 and thereby build the foundation for larger investments by the \ngovernments and the private sector into resolving the long-term problems.13 \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: cross-border trade and investment between \nNTT and Timor-Leste increased. The TA will have the following outcome: enabling environment \nfor cross-border livestock trade and tourism cooperation enhanced between NTT and Timor-\nLeste.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Knowledge  and  capacity  for  cross-border  transport  and  trade \nstrengthened. The TA will seek to reduce the policy and capacity barriers to cross-border trade \nand transport by supporting cross-border agreements on transport. This will include technical \nadvice and support for meetings to finalize and implement a draft memorandum of understanding \n(MOU) on cross-border movement of buses and coaches and to explore an MOU on goods \nvehicles to encourage agricultural trade.15 The TA will also provide priority training of customs, \nimmigration, and quarantine staff for joint risk management at the border. This will support the \nMOUs between the customs authorities that the two countries are discussing. The TA will also \nprovide policy advice to Timor-Leste on visa reform, particularly on assisting cross-border tourism; \nand help conduct a review of the regulatory and legislative environment for cross-border air \nconnectivity, with particular reference to lessons learned from the ASEAN Open Skies policy.16 \n \n12.  Output 2: Animal health requirements for livestock trade bolstered. The TA proposes \nto tackle the most immediate causes of trade bans over animal health concerns by (i) assisting \nthe  assessment  and  certification  of  NTT  as  free  from  avian  influenza,  (ii) supporting  the \napplication of Timor-Leste as an FMD-free country with OIE, and (iii) making recommendations \nfor joint surveillance and assessment of brucellosis in cattle in Timor-Leste. As regards the \nsurveillance of brucellosis, the intention is to work with producer groups or small and medium-\nsized  enterprises  that  promote  sustainable  and  resilient  agricultural  practices  and  the \nengagement of women, particularly in higher value-added activities.17 Activities will also support \n                                                \n13 Long term problems are identified within the Scoping Study on Enhanced Cross-Border Cooperation and Integration \nbetween Indonesia and Timor-Leste. \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 Joint Meeting of the Indonesia and Timor-Leste Cross-Border Livestock and Tourism Pilot Project: Meeting Summary \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). During a joint meeting on the TA activities, the two \ncountries agreed to prioritize a draft MOU on buses and coaches and to explore wider transport agreements that \nwould support agricultural trade. \n16 Also known as the ASEAN Single Aviation Market, a policy that came into effect in 2015 to liberalize air services \nwithin a unified air transport market. \n17 Surveillance of animal disease is supported by good animal husbandry. In the context of Timor-Leste control of \nanimal movement is vital for disease surveillance and increasing productivity. Consequently, this output should be \nconducted with groups receiving support in this area. Women tend to be involved in low value activities in the livestock \nvalue chain hence producer groups which enable women to be engaged in higher value aspects of production and \nmarketing should be encouraged. \n ", "4 \na  technical  cooperation  agreement  between  the  agriculture  ministries  of  Timor-Leste  and \nIndonesia.18 \n \n13.  Output 3: Potential joint tourism itineraries identified. The TA will provide capacity \nbuilding and advice on mapping the tourism assets of NTT and Timor-Leste, and designing a joint \nland or sea tourism itinerary for marketing and promotion. This will be done in partnership with \nthe government, individual tour operators, and tourism and business organizations such as the \nHotel Owners Association of Timor-Leste and the chambers of commerce of NTT and Timor-\nLeste.19 The emphasis will be on supporting a brand of tourism that aligns with Indonesia\u2019s and \nTimor-Leste\u2019s  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  particularly  with  regard  to  environmental \nprotection and gender equality.20 This will build the foundation for a comprehensive strategy of \njoint tourism promotion and help define the long-term infrastructure investment needs (e.g., water \nand sanitation in community-based tourism attractions) and workforce training needs. \n \n14.  To help prepare for larger sector investments, the TA team will conduct activities to \nestablish baselines and collect data to forecast project costs and benefits. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000, of which (i) $250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and (ii) $700,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund (RCIF).21 The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.22 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented from July 2019 to July 2021. ADB will be the executing \nagency.  The  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Thematic  Group  of  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department will administer the TA; select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants; procure goods (para.19); organize workshops; and provide staff to act as \nresource persons in the workshops. The thematic group will implement the TA in consultation with \na joint task force comprising the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste and \nthe Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia. \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n                                                \n18 In 2018, the livestock directorates in the agriculture ministries of Timor-Leste and Indonesia signed a technical \ncooperation agreement that includes cross-border capacity building, knowledge sharing, and collaboration on animal \nhealth. \n19 Launched in March 2019, the Hotel Owners Association of Timor-Leste supports tourism in Timor-Leste and receives \ncapacity building from other development partners. By partnering with the association, ADB would further strengthen \nits capacity. Similar bodies in NTT will be engaged. \n20 For example, the emphasis will be on opportunities for ecotourism and on working with partners that support female \nentrepreneurs. \n21 Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n22 Additional financing of about $1 million will be sought within the lifetime of the TA to expand activities in line with \nrecommendations from the scoping study.
