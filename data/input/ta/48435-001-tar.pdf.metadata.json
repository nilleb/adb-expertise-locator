INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  cluster  regional  capacity  building  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to \naddress energy poverty in Asia and the Pacific. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in the \ncourse of implementing its Energy for All Initiative and Clean Energy Program, has conducted \nextensive  consultations  on  scaling  up  access  to  energy,  renewable  energy,  and  energy \nefficiency  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  representing  governments,  civil  society \norganizations, the private sector, financial institutions, and development partners. ADB, as the \nleading partner and host of the Asia-Pacific Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) hub, supports \nthe SE4ALL initiative to (i) ensure universal access to modern energy services; (ii) double the \nannual global rate of improvement in energy efficiency; and (iii) double the share of renewable \nenergy in the global energy mix, all by 2030. 1 \n \n2.  The proposed TA aims to provide accessible, cleaner, and more efficient energy in Asia \nand the Pacific through mainstreaming operations while focusing on the nexus of the three \npillars of the ADB Energy Policy: (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy; (ii) \nmaximizing access to energy for all; and (iii) promoting energy sector reform, capacity building, \nand  governance.2 The  proposed  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB  Strategy  2020\u2019s  environmentally \nsustainable growth agenda and Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, especially with regard to the \nenvironment  and  ADB\u2019s  climate  change  strategic  priority  for  2014\u20132020.3 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework of the cluster TA is in Appendix 1.4 \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Energy  security  and  the  region\u2019s  increasing  energy  consumption.  By  2035, \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s primary global energy consumption is expected to increase to as much as \n56%  from  34%  in  2010.5 This  trend  reflects  (i)  Asia\u2019s  increasing  role  as  a  center  of \nmanufacturing, (ii) its commercial sector growth, and (iii) its greatly expanded population (in \nparticular its urban population), which has resulted in over half of global megacities in Asia. This \nenergy consumption is being met by rapidly growing energy imports. ADB projects that by 2035, \nmost countries in the region will generate only half of the energy they require locally, with the \nrest of the demand met by imports. Imported oil in particular will continue to be critical in the \nregion. The projected level of consumption requires approaches beyond the installation of new \npower generation. For instance, a 1%\u20134% investment in energy efficiency, as a share of overall \nenergy sector investments, can meet as much as 25% of the projected increase in primary \nenergy consumption in developing Asian countries by 2030.6 \n \n4.  Need for sustainable energy solutions. Clean energy responds to both energy supply \nissues and the threat of climate change; it decouples economic and social development from \nincreased greenhouse gas emissions. The People\u2019s Republic of China and India are among the \nglobal leaders in renewable energy development, which is now the fastest growing sector of \nenergy  generation.  The  wide  range  of  clean  energy  resources  available  also  benefits  the \n                                                \n1 Sustainable Energy for All.

Increased energy efficiency is possible \nthroughout all of the region\u2019s economies.  \n \n5.  Majority  of  the  world\u2019s  energy  poor  is  found  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The \nInternational  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  estimates  that  around  628  million  people  in  the  region \naccount for almost 50% of the total number of people globally without access to electricity.7 The \nregion also ranks the highest in terms of dependence on traditional solid fuels for cooking, with \n1.8 billion people (out of a global total of 2.6 billion) lacking access to clean cooking solutions. \nAccess to electricity and clean cooking energy solutions has tremendous positive impacts on \nthe environment, greenhouse gas reduction, and the socioeconomic situation of people. \n \n6.  Energy  poverty  is  not  only  a  rural  problem.  Asian  cities  currently  have  an \nurbanization rate of more than 40% and are home to more than 500 million urban poor. With  \n90% of the urban growth taking place in the developing world, the Asian urban population will \nreach 2.6 billion people by 2030.8 The urban poor are deprived of basic services, including the \nprovision of reliable and efficient lighting, heating, and cooking, which excludes them from the \nbenefits  of  modern  energy  services  and  exposes  them  to  serious  health  risks  from \nunsustainable  and  harmful  cooking  practices.  Urban  sector  interventions  often  miss  such \nissues. \n \n7.  Huge investment requirements to address energy poverty. The IEA has estimated \nthat around $600 billion of additional investment is required to provide universal access to \nelectricity by 2030, or an average of $35 billion per year (footnote 9). According to the IEA, the \nAsia and Pacific region accounts for 36% of this investment need based on current levels of \nenergy poverty. Private financing can and should play a greater role. \n \n8.  The problem of energy poverty and the need for sustainable energy solutions are of \nglobal concern. The SE4ALL initiative is a global response to these issues that will help catalyze \nmajor  new  investment  opportunities  to  speed  up  the  transformation  of  the  world\u2019s  energy \nsystems, pursue the elimination of energy poverty, and enhance prosperity. Even though energy \nwas left out in the Millennium Development Goals, sustainable energy is now being proposed as \none of the Sustainable Development Goals for the post-2015 development agenda and is \nconsistent with the vision and objectives of the SE4ALL initiative. The proposed TA could assist \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in undertaking early actions to implement the proposed \nenergy Sustainable Development Goal in the post-2015 era.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the proposed cluster TA will be achievement of Sustainable Energy for All \ntargets in Asia and the Pacific. This will be measured against the SE4ALL targets of (i) universal \naccess to modern energy services; (ii) a doubling of the annual global rate of improvement in \nenergy efficiency; and (iii) a doubling of the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, \nall by 2030. The overall outcome of the proposed cluster TA will be increased capacity, maturity, \n                                                \n7 IEA. 2014. World Energy Outlook.

The target is to increase investment for SE4ALL \nby $1 billion by 2020. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The cluster TA will build on ADB\u2019s experience and is proposed to formulate a more \nintegrated  response  to  energy  poverty  and  energy  security,  addressing  technological, \ninstitutional,  and  operational  barriers  to  achieve  sustainable  energy  for  all  by  2030.  The \nproposed  cluster  TA  subprojects  will  complement  existing  regional  TA  projects  such  as \nEmpowering the Poor through Increasing Access to Energy and other activities under ADB\u2019s \nClean Energy Initiative and Energy for All Program for promotion of energy access, renewable \nenergy, and energy efficiency.9 Partnerships with other institutions, governments, and private \nsector organizations will be forged to increase the impact of the TA, ensure its complementary \nnature,  and  avoid  duplication  with  other  efforts.  Also,  North\u2013South  and  South\u2013South \ncooperation on knowledge sharing and experiences will be promoted among ADB\u2019s member \ncountries and beyond. There will be four subprojects initially included in the cluster TA that \ndirectly contribute toward achieving 2030 SE4ALL targets; additional subprojects, or topping up \nof initial subprojects, may be proposed later. Paras. 11\u201314 outline the methodology and key \nactivities, consistent with fund regulations, agreements, and guidelines, including eligibility of \nexpenditure of each of the subprojects. \n \n11.  Subproject  A:  Renewable  energy  mini-grids  and  distributed  power  generation. \nThis subproject addresses the fundamental challenge of providing access to energy by utilizing \ncombinations  of  technologies  and  new  private  sector  business  models.  It  aims  to  provide \nsupport to entrepreneurs and private sector project developers in DMCs in identifying and \ndeveloping viable projects for investment from ADB\u2019s private and public sector windows or other \nsources. This will provide more targeted investment advisory and due diligence support to those \nproject  developers  that  could  benefit  from  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department \nprogram  providing  concessional  finance  to  a  range  of  early  to  mid-stage  mini-grid  and \ndistributed power generation companies in ADB\u2019s DMCs. The subproject also aims to build \npartnerships to encourage regulators, policy makers, and other stakeholders to recognize that (i) \na healthy enabling environment for private developers is critical to achieving universal energy \naccess; and (ii) there will be a need to continue providing assistance to DMCs in their efforts to \nbuild capacity, share knowledge, and create an enabling environment for the private sector.  \n \n12.  Subproject B:  Energy access for the urban poor. This subproject will address urban \nenergy poverty in the region by overcoming the major barriers in the deployment of clean, \nreliable, and environmentally friendly energy services. It will address the lack of energy services \nthrough  (i)  stakeholder  consultation;  (ii)  active  involvement  of  government  agencies, \nmunicipalities, electricity utility companies, the community, and civil society organizations; and \n(iii) the introduction of new inclusive business models that allow sustainable access to energy. \nFurthermore, this subproject will support DMCs in pursuing reforms to address issues that \ndirectly relate to urban energy poverty such as the lack of attention to informal settlements, high \nup-front cost of connecting to modern energy, unreliable distribution network of energy services \ncommon in urban slums, and energy-inefficient construction of housing. This subproject will also \nreview ADB\u2019s pipeline of projects in the energy and urban sectors, and it will provide support to \nADB\u2019s operations departments in identifying best models and pilot testing which then can be \nscaled up with possible ADB investment. The subproject will also support promotion of green \narchitecture and energy-efficient construction methods in low-cost housing. Pilot projects will be \n                                                \n9 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Empowering the Poor through Increasing Access to Energy.

Subproject C: Sustainable Energy for All regional hub for Asia and the Pacific. \nADB, through its Energy for All Initiative, has been a part of SE4ALL even prior to its official \nlaunch, and has remained a close partner of SE4ALL from its launch to the present. In June \n2014, ADB formally became lead organization for SE4ALL in Asia and the Pacific and host of \nthe regional hub, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme and the \nUnited  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  proposed \nsubproject will provide secretariat services and expert inputs to support the participation of \nADB\u2019s DMCs in SE4ALL in (i) developing their action agendas, investment prospectuses, and \ndetailed project design; (ii) mobilizing their resources; and (iii) undertaking other activities such \nas capacity building, knowledge sharing, and tracking of results of SE4ALL in Asia and the \nPacific. Monitoring and tracking of progress will be undertaken together with the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe Pacific, as well as the global facilitation team of SE4ALL through an online platform that will \nalso serve as a repository of knowledge products. All subproject activities will support ADB\u2019s \nEnergy for All Initiative and Clean Energy Program.    \n \n14.  Subproject  D:  Project  development  and  investment  facilitation.  Through  this \nsubproject, the methodology of ADB\u2019s Energy for All Initiative in identifying credible energy \naccess entrepreneurs, providing relevant project development services through its mentoring \nprogram, and facilitating private sector investment will be scaled up. This subproject will also \noffer support services to impact investors and financing institutions to support small-scale, high-\nimpact investments in areas such as energy access or sustainable energy. These support \nservices include feasibility studies of electricity generation, providing due diligence support, \npiloting risk-sharing mechanisms, and offering other technical assistance applications that serve \na catalytic role in deploying private sector capital to sustainable energy enterprises and their \nend  users.  Support  for  development  of  projects  involving  a  range  of  new  and  innovative \ninstruments  such  as  output-based  aid  and  results-based  financing  will  be  provided.  This \nsubproject will also support piloting some of these innovative concepts to prepare for financing \nfrom  ADB  or  other  sources  for  scaling  up.  An  online  platform  will  also  be  developed  to \ncoordinate services for energy access entrepreneurs and investors in a systematic way. The \nexperts will review ADB\u2019s pipeline of projects and assist ADB\u2019s operations departments during \nproject  identification,  development  (pre-project  preparatory  TA  and  project  preparatory  TA \nstages), and implementation. It will support an existing or new entity, in collaboration with other \ndevelopment partners, to continue providing project development and investment facilitation \nservices in the long term for projects that address sustainable energy for all. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $7.738 million, of which (i) $3.500 million will be financed on \na grant basis by the Clean Technology Fund and administered by ADB, (ii) $2.738 million will be \nfinanced on grant basis by the Government of Austria and administered by ADB, and (iii) $1.500 \nmillion will be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.10 A possible increase of $17.262 \nmillion in the TA amount through additional allocation from donors may be considered in the \nfuture, subject to resource availability and implementation progress to reach target of $25 \nmillion. The details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n10 The financing partners of the Clean Energy Fund are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.  \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing and implementing agency of the TA. The Sector Advisory \nService  Division  of  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department  will  be \nresponsible for the overall implementation of all the subprojects under the TA and will work \nclosely with ADB\u2019s operations departments and Energy Sector Group in undertaking specific \nactivities and engaging other partners.11 ADB\u2019s TA mission leader will lead the implementation \nof the TA under the guidance of the Sector Advisory Service Division Senior Director and \nTechnical Advisor (Energy). A working group of ADB staff representing operations departments \nand  other  support  departments  will  be  set  up  to  enhance  coordination  and  effective \nimplementation  of  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  procedures  will  be  applied  during  the \nimplementation of the TA regardless of the funding source. All DMCs will benefit from this TA, \nbut  few  DMCs  will  be  targeted  for  pilot  testing  during  the  subproject  approval  stage. \nConfirmation of no objection will be obtained from participating DMCs before any activities \nfinanced by the TA commence in those DMCs. The Sector Advisory Service Division has the \ncapacity to implement the TA and will also engage consultants to help implement the TA \nsubprojects.12 The implementation period of this cluster TA will be 5.5 years, from June 2015 to \nDecember 2020. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  mainly  finance  consulting  services,  pilots,  and  other  capacity  building \nactivities. The TA will require 344 person-months of international and 520 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services  in  the  areas  of  investments,  project  development,  sustainable \nenergy, energy policy, and communications. Individual consultants will be engaged to be flexible \nand timely fielded. Some international and national consultants will be engaged in long-term \nsupport roles. For some activities that are best packaged and managed independently of the \ncore team, consultancy firms may be engaged using consultant quality-based selection and \nquality- and cost-based selection. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix \n3. Engagement of experts will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Partnership  with  centers  of  excellence  will  be  promoted.  All \nprocurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). The disposal of all equipment procured under the TA will \nfollow ADB disposal procedures. Output-based or lump sum contracts will be considered as \nappropriate  where  possible  to  reduce  administrative  burden  and  improve  efficiency  and \neconomy. Disbursements under the TA will be performed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n18.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Clean Technology Fund, and (ii) ADB administering a portion of technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $2,738,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of \nAustria, for Promoting Sustainable Energy for All in Asia and the Pacific. If the Board approves \nADB administering the technical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated \nby the Board, approves ADB administering a portion of the technical assistance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under \nthe Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for Promoting Sustainable Energy for All in Asia \nand the Pacific. \n                                                \n11 Some in-kind support will be provided by the participating governments. Efforts will be made to link with ongoing \nADB and government programs to leverage additional support. \n12 The Sector Advisory Service Division as TA supervising unit is experienced in administering high-value TA projects \nand has also already managed a TA project similar to this (footnote 11). \n ", "6               Appendix 1                 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and   \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting   \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nSE4ALL targets  By 2030, universal access to  Government statistical  Strong and stable \nin Asia and the  modern energy services (2010  and census reports  commitment from the \nPacific achieved  baseline: 1.2 billion people    governments in achieving  \nwithout access to electricity  SE4ALL status reports  SE4ALL \nworldwide, of which about half  of the United Nations,   \nare in Asia and the Pacific)  ADB, and World Bank  Risk \n    Inadequate resources to \nBy 2030, a doubling of the    mobilize project \nshare of renewable energy in     development and \nthe global energy mix (2010  implementation \nbaseline: 18% share of \nrenewable energy) \n \nBy 2030, a doubling of the \nannual global rate of \nimprovement in energy \nefficiency (2010 baseline: rate \nof energy efficiency of 1.2%) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased  Investment approved for  Country reports  Continuous strong \ncapacity,  SE4ALL increased by $1    support and commitment \nmaturity, and  billion by 2020   IEA reports   from governments \ninvestment     \nreadiness of   SE4ALL reports   Governments install \nSE4ALL projects    reforms and put in place \n    national plans and \n    policies that are \n    conducive for sustainable \nenergy projects \n   \n \nRisk \nAverage project size and \nquantity of private sector \ninvestments are low \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
