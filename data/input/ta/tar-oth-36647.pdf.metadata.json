INTRODUCTION \n \n \n \n1.  In  June  1999  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  regional  technical \nassistance (TA) to establish the Asia Recovery Information Center (ARIC), funded by a grant \nfrom  the  Government  of  Australia.  The  TA\u2019s  objective  was  to  provide  a  web-based \nclearinghouse to consolidate, disseminate, analyze, and exchange information on the Asian \ncrisis and recovery. The TA covered the five countries most affected by the crisis: Indonesia, \nRepublic  of  Korea  (henceforth  Korea),  Malaysia,  Philippines,  and  Thailand.  The  TA  was \nimplemented over 1 year and 9 months, and completed in March 2001.  \n2.  In response to the ARIC advisory committee\u2019s recommendation,1 in April 2001 ADB \napproved a regional TA for ARIC\u2019s second phase, funded by a new grant from the Government \nof Australia and covering eight developing member countries (DMCs), including the five affected \ncountries, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Singapore, and Viet Nam. The TA was to be \nimplemented  over  12  months,  which  was  later  extended  due  to  cost  savings.  The  TA  is \nscheduled to be completed in November 2003. \n \n3.  The third meeting of the ARIC advisory committee, held in April 2002, concluded that the \nARIC web site had provided valuable services to many East Asian countries in their recovery \nfrom the crisis, and that demand for such services was still strong. The ARIC web site will help \nthese  countries  respond  to  the  challenges  of  globalization.  The  advisory  committee  thus \nrecommended a third phase of ARIC, and so this TA is proposed. The TA paper reflects the \npurpose and output, methodology and key activities, cost estimates and financing plan, and \nimplementation arrangements of ARIC Phase III.2 The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The ARIC web site was established in 1999 by ADB under a TA3 in response to a \nproposal by the Sydney Meeting on Development Cooperation: Responding to the Asia Crisis to \nset up an Internet-based information facility for collaborative exchange of information on, and \nanalysis of, the Asian crisis and recovery, and a request from the Government of Australia to \nhouse the facility. The TA was approved in June 1999, covered five countries most affected by \nthe Asian crisis, and funded by a grant from the Government of Australia.  \n \n5.  Launched in November 1999, the ARIC web site was envisaged as an information \nclearinghouse focusing on (i) social and economic impacts of the Asian crisis and recovery; (ii) \ndevelopment assistance and domestic policies and programs in response to the crisis, including \nthose in relation to social safety nets; (iii) emerging assistance needs identified by the affected \ncountries or aid agencies; and (iv) public, private, and nongovernment sector expertise that can \nbe  used  to  address  specific  crisis-related  issues.  The  web  site\u2019s  targeted  users  include \ngovernment officials at various levels in the countries covered by the TA and other DMCs, aid \nagencies,  private  sector,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  economic  policy  analysts, \nacademic researchers, and journalists. With its overall policy directions guided by an advisory \n                                                 \n1  Co-chaired by ADB and Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), with representatives from the \nAsia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 2003. \n3  ADB.1999. Technical Assistance for Establishment of the Asia Recovery Information Center. Manila. ", "2  \ncommittee,  the  web  site  was  expected  to  help  countries  recover  from  the  crisis  and  fight \npoverty. \n \n6.  Shortly after its launch, the web site became a leading portal of information and analysis \non the Asian crisis and recovery, quickly building up a sizable usership, with 300 visitors and \n4,000 hits per day in early 2000. The web site also received a number of favorable external \nreviews and citations. In February 2000 the Scout Report4 cited ARIC as \u201ctruly invaluable to \nusers following the Asian crisis.\u201d In May 2000 Forbes rated ARIC as one of the \u201cBest of the \nWeb\u201d in its summer issue. The World Bank introduced ARIC in its Interest Bearing Notes \nNewsletter in May 2000. In the same month the Asia Observer5 featured ARIC as a \u201cSite of the \nWeek.\u201d In August 2000 the Far Eastern Economic Review cited ARIC as \u201ca good source of \nupdates on Asia\u2019s recovering economies.\u201d During ARIC dissemination seminars in Indonesia \nand  Thailand,  participants  from  government  and  aid  agencies  (World  Bank,  International \nMonetary Fund [IMF], and United Nations Development Programme [UNDP]) indicated that they \nhad been using the ARIC web site for their work.6  \n7.  Based on the performance of ARIC and demand for its services, as well as on an \nindependent  evaluation  conducted  by  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID), the ARIC advisory committee, which met again on 28 September 2000 at the ADB \nHeadquarters, recommended a second phase of ARIC. ADB approved a TA for ARIC Phase II \nin March 2001, funded by a new grant from the Government of Australia.7 As at that time, \nalthough recovery had been faster than expected, it was still incomplete and ARIC, therefore, \nkept  its  original  mandate.  At  the  same  time,  policymakers  were  increasingly  turning  their \nattention to medium-term issues of economic management and crisis prevention. In response to \nchanging circumstances, ARIC would strengthen its monitoring function to help DMCs detect \neconomic and financial vulnerability. \n8.  The web site was thus improved and expanded in the second phase. Eight DMCs were \ncovered  (the  five  affected  countries,  PRC,  Singapore,  and  Viet  Nam).  ARIC\u2019s  capacity  to \nhighlight topical and emerging economic and policy issues was also enhanced. SARS Watch, \nfor  example,  is  an  ARIC  site  that  exclusively  disseminates  SARS-related  information  and \nanalysis. ARIC\u2019s second phase saw continuously improved performance, with 530 visitors and \n8,500 hits per day at the beginning of the second phase, and about 700 and 9,100 in May 2003. \nThe web site continued to receive favorable reviews and citations by reputable media sources, \nincluding Forbes.8 \n9.  The ARIC advisory committee met a third time in April 2002 at the ADB Headquarters, \nand concluded that the web site had helped many East Asian countries recover from the crisis \nand that demand for such services was still strong. The committee recommended a third phase \nfor ARIC, based on the following considerations:  \n                                                 \n4  The Scout Report is a weekly publication by the Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin-Madison, \nUnited States, offering a selection of new and newly discovered Internet resources of interest to researchers and \neducators. \n5  Asia Observer is a web site of news and development in East and Southeast Asia. \n6  Dissemination seminars were organized by the Regional Economic Monitoring Unit in November 2000, with \nassistance of the ADB Resident Mission in Indonesia and Extended Mission in Thailand. \n7  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for the Asia Recovery Information Center. Manila. \n8  Winter 2002 and Spring 2003. Best of the Web. Forbes. \n ", "  3\n(i)  Although many Asian countries have significantly recovered, much financial and \ncorporate restructuring and structural reform remains to be done, and for which \nARIC still has a role to play as a clearinghouse of information.  \n(ii)  With increasing globalization, developing countries are exposed to more risks \nand need to be extremely vigilant against possible external shocks and crises, \nand to monitor vulnerability not only in their own economies but also in others. \nARIC\u2019s services will continue to be highly relevant and in demand.  \n(iii)  Financial crises could reverse gains in poverty reduction. By mitigating financial \ncrises,  therefore,  ARIC  will  also  help  DMCs,  ADB,  and  other  development \npartners fight poverty.  \n(iv)  The ARIC web site has established itself as an important and credible source of \ninformation and analysis on the Asian crisis and recovery, and earned a high \nreputation among its targeted users. Given the amount of financial and human \nresources  invested  in  this  project  by  AusAID,  ADB,  and  other  development \npartners,  continuing  ARIC\u2019s  operations  after  the  second  phase  would  cost-\neffectively enhance ADB's development impact.  \n10.  The  ARIC  web  site  has  helped  ADB  promote  regional  monetary  and  financial \ncooperation by providing valuable services to targeted users in DMCs and worldwide and by \nsupporting activities of the Regional Economic Monitoring Unit (REMU). ADB established REMU \nto support the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Surveillance Process in 1999. \nOver the years, as regional efforts to promote monetary and financial cooperation, mainly in \nareas of information exchange, surveillance, and resource pooling, have evolved, requests for \nREMU\u2019s  support  have  increased.  REMU  now  supports  five  regional  groups\u2014ASEAN, \nASEAN+3,  Manila  Framework  Group,  Asia-Europe  Finance  Ministers  Process,  Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers Process\u2014through high-frequency monitoring, \ncapacity building, and special studies. The ARIC web site, including its online publication, Asia \nEconomic Monitor (AEM), is essential for REMU to provide supporting services to its clients and \nfulfill its mandate. \n \n11.  The TA for ARIC Phase III is a response to the recommendation of the ARIC advisory \ncommittee and the need to continue supporting REMU operations. ARIC Phase III will focus on \nhigh-frequency  monitoring  of  national,  subregional,  and  regional  economic  and  financial \nvulnerabilities, structural reforms, and emerging policy issues. ARIC\u2019s country coverage will be \nextended to include 11 DMCs in East Asia and 4 in South Asia. The selection of the latter is \nbased on the availability of high-frequency data. The expansion of country coverage can be \njustified by the demand for ARIC services by these countries and the fact the additional cost for \nincluding another country in ARIC is small.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The objective of the TA is to continue second-phase ARIC activities and maintain ARIC \nas a regional facility to monitor national, subregional, and regional economic and financial \nvulnerabilities, structural reforms, and emerging policy issues. As in the previous phases, the \ntargeted web-site users will be government officials at various levels in the countries covered by \n ", "4  \nthe TA, other DMCs, officials of aid agencies, private sector users, NGOs, economic policy \nanalysts, academic researchers, and journalists.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will (i) expand the web site to reflect its new focus (monitoring economic and \nfinancial vulnerabilities, structural reforms, and emerging policy issues in participating countries) \nand extended country coverage; (ii) maintain the web site; and (iii) prepare the AEM. \n \n14.  Six to eight issues of AEM will be produced for on-line publication during the TA. AEM \nwill review and analyze economic and financial vulnerabilities, structural reforms, and emerging \npolicy issues of countries covered by the TA, on the basis of high-frequency ARIC indicators. \n \n15.  The TA will cover 11 DMCs of the ASEAN+3 group: Cambodia, PRC, Indonesia, Korea, \nLao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and \nViet Nam; and 4 South Asian DMCs: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is $785,593 equivalent; $381,0139 equivalent will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  Australia  and  administered  by  ADB;  and  $404,58010 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost will cover \nremuneration, travel, and per diem for international and local consultants, computer hardware \nand software, supplies, communication, printing, and publication. A detailed cost breakdown \nand the proposed financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the TA Executing Agency. REMU will implement the TA, collaborating \nclosely with other ADB departments and offices. The ARIC advisory committee, consisting of \nrepresentatives from APEC, ASEAN, AusAID, ADB, IMF, UNDP, and World Bank will continue \nto provide overall policy direction. The advisory committee, chaired jointly by ADB and AusAID \nrepresentatives, will meet as needed. \n \n18.  The TA will require approximately 26 person-months of international and 182 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  All  the  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  individual \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nOutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  One international consultant\u2014an economist with expertise in development issues in \nAsia, and strong analytical, liaison, and communication skills\u2014will be designated as the team \nleader. Under the supervision of ADB staff, the consultant will oversee other consultants who \nwill develop and maintain the ARIC web site. The other international consultants\u2014economists \nfamiliar with development issues in Asia, particularly the participating countries, and with strong \nanalytical and communication skills\u2014will help prepare special studies on topical issues with \nsignificant policy implications as inputs to AEM, under the supervision of ADB staff. Domestic \n                                                 \n9  This includes $155,439 savings from a regional TA (ADB. 1999. Establishment of the Asia Recovery Information \nCenter [ARIC Phase I]. Manila) and an additional grant of $225,574.  \n10 This includes $44,580 savings from a regional TA (ADB. 1998. Technical Training and Capacity Building in Support \nof the ASEAN Economic Surveillance Process. Manila) and $360,000 new allocation.  \n ", "  5\nconsultants,  consisting of  two  web  programmers,  a  parttime  copyeditor,  and  six  economic \nanalysts, will help expand and operate the web site. The economic analysts will have extensive \nexperience in economic, social, and financial data processing and analysis, be familiar with \neconomic and policy issues of the participating countries, have strong communication skills, and \nbe proficient in using standard computer applications software. \n \n20.  Procurement  of  equipment  (computer  hardware  and  software)  by  ADB  will  be  in \naccordance with its Guidelines for Procurement. Procurement will take place in coordination \nwith ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and Office of Administrative Services. \nAfter TA completion, any procured equipment will be disposed of in accordance with Project \nAdministration Instructions 5.11. \n \n21.  The  TA  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  24  months,  from  December  2003  to \nNovember 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $381,013 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $404,580 on a grant basis for the Asia Recovery Information \nCenter Phase III, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nMonitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets \nMechanisms  Risks \n1.
