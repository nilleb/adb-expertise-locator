The Asian Development Bank (ADB) implemented the regional technical assistance \n(RETA)  on  Strengthening  and  Collection  of  Purchasing  Power  Parity  Data  in  Selected \nDeveloping Member Countries1, which conducted the 2005 International Comparison Program \nfor Asia and the Pacific (ICP Asia Pacific) from 2003 to 2007.  The RETA compiled 2005 \npurchasing power parity (PPP) data for major macroeconomic variables. It produced regionally \ncomparable price levels, expenditure values, and PPP estimates that can inform national policy \nmakers, economists, international organizations, and academics about the relative purchasing \npower of citizens of the participating economies. Major aggregates of the ICP such as the final \nconsumption  expenditure  generated  robust  price-level  data  for  policy-relevant  expenditure \ncategories such as the share of food in household consumption in different economies or the \nshare of total food outlays spent on staple products. 2   \n \n2.  PPPs also play a crucial role in generating internationally comparable estimates of \npoverty.  Whether the task is to determine an international poverty line (IPL) or to convert a \ngiven IPL into local currency units, the importance of using an appropriate PPP cannot be over-\nemphasized. In fact, quantifying the purchasing power differences across countries and income \ngroups is the first and vital step for compiling an IPL ($1-a-day) that is critical for measuring and \ncomparing the prevalence of poverty, and for monitoring the effectiveness of poverty reduction \npolicies\u2014the first of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \n3.   ICP Asia Pacific has become the premier source of information on regional comparisons \nand MDG monitoring. The experience obtained from it demonstrates that good governance, and \nstrong commitment and dedicated cooperation of the participating economies are important \ningredients in achieving the success of the biggest regional statistical undertaking in the area. \nThe 2005 ICP Asia Pacific has been hailed as a statistical milestone with the participation of 23 \neconomies in the region; however, there is much more to do and many challenges remain. The \nproposed RETA intends to address those challenges by building on the momentum of the \nrecently concluded 2005 ICP round and capitalizing on the benefits of capacity-building steps \ntaken by national statistical offices (NSOs) to ensure sustainability of the ICP framework for \nnon-benchmark  years.3  Addressing  these  concerns  is  seen  to  increase  the  leverage  and \nreadiness of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) in the region for the next round of \nbenchmark ICP targeted in 2011.  The RETA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A continuing challenge for the ICP in the Asia and Pacific region is the need to gain the \ncooperation  of  NSOs  in  providing  data  that  are  not  a  standard  part  of  their  regular  data \ncollection exercises. Although the NSOs involved in the 2005 ICP have benefited either directly \nor indirectly from the ICP experience and have come to see the advantage of the ICP structured \nproduct and service description, data-handling methods, and other procedures that have aided \nin their national work, the priority for most of them is still their national statistics. Therefore,, it \nmay be appropriate for the ICP to integrate and align ICP data requests as closely as possible \nwith the regular NSO work with prices and national accounts. Such integration could enable \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Selected Developing Member Countries for the Strengthening and Collection \nof Purchasing Power Parity Data.  Manila (TA 6088-REG, approved on 19 December, for $1.2 million). \n2    ADB. 2007. Purchasing Power Parities and Real Expenditures, 2005 ICP Asia Pacific. Manila (Tables 30\u201331). \n3    A non-benchmark year is one when no global ICP is being conducted. \n4   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 July 2008. \n ", "2  \nmore frequent and less expensive ICP activities.  For instance, the Organization for Economic \nCo-operation and Development/Eurostat model uses a 3-year price collection program. For \nthem, the additional effort required for price comparison is relatively small. Most of the required \ndata are already regularly collected. This is one possibility the RETA proposes to explore. Such \na strategy would clearly reduce costs for countries, maintain the necessary expertise, and allow \nthe  alignment  of  the  technical  capacity-building  effort  with  price  and  national  accounts \nprograms, which are already subject to much technical assistance.   \n \n5.  The framework for collecting prices for the consumer price index (CPI) in countries is \ngeared toward getting a good reading on temporal price movements, i.e., to measure price \nmovements over time within a country. Products priced are country-specific, taking into account \ncountry-specific consumption patterns, habits, etc. However, this framework for collecting prices \nis not much of a guide for spatial price differences. Hence, the ICP product list that was created \nrequired pricing comparable items of expenditure across national boundaries. In the 2005 ICP, a \ntotal of 656 products were priced.  Most countries found the surveys very costly in terms of both \nhuman resource and budgetary requirements because of a significant increase in the workload. \nThis poses a challenge on the sustainability of the PPP for non-benchmark years. A balanced \nreduction  in  the  number  of  ICP  products,  combined  with  initiatives  aimed  at  aligning  and \nmainstreaming the ICP activities more closely in routine statistical programs of NSOs, would \nensure the sustainability of the comparison program during non-benchmark years. It would also \nsignificantly reduce operational costs and ensure that price inputs for estimating PPPs during \nnon-benchmark years will be available. To address the issue, the rich database generated from \nthe 2005 ICP will be explored for generating a primary product list.  \n \n6.  Harmonizing the ICP and CPI price collection was also emphasized in the country \nreports relating to experiences gained from the 2005 ICP. A largely reduced list would not only \nenable countries to absorb the cost of pricing an additional list of ICP products, but would also \nallow  for  an  uninterrupted  flow  of  the  regular  price  collection  survey.  To  facilitate  such \nintegration, the primary product list needs to be matched with the CPI product list to establish \noverlaps.  Products outside the overlap would be kept to a minimum without jeopardizing the \nintegrity of the PPP computation. \n \n7.  The 2005 ICP had introduced new approaches in  pricing non-household consumption \nexpenditure, especially those relating to investment or gross fixed capital formation, such as \nmachinery and equipment; and construction. Construction is a major part of investment, but it is \nalso one of the most difficult components of the gross domestic product (GDP) to price. The \n2005 ICP measures relative prices at the level of the construction components such as major \ninstalled components of construction projects, labor, and equipment. A major benefit of this new \napproach  is  that  it  can  be  used  to  build  in  countries  the  capacity  to  price  construction \ncomponents for potential use in the construction sector. The other major part of investment is \ncapital equipment.  This is another problematic area for pricing. During the 2005 ICP, the \nstructured  product  description  (SPD)  methodology  was  introduced  for  equipment  (and \nhousehold consumption items). The SPD approach systematically captures price-determining \ncharacteristics that uniquely define a product. This method allows harmonizing the individual \ncountry  equipment  lists  used  for  price  surveys.    In  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region,  these \nmethodologies are relatively new and should be further refined and fully exploited. Countries \nwould be encouraged to adopt these new frameworks in producing national price indicators. \nThey can expect to see improvements in their ability to monitor product quality and control for \nvariations through time.   \n   ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The RETA\u2019s intended impact is increased implementation of international standards in \nmacro- and micro-economic statistics with emphasis on price statistics.  In particular, the impact \nis greater harmonization of ICP with CPI price collection activities in NSOs through a more \nmanageable regional ICP operation. The RETA seeks to institutionalize ICP price collections in \nthe NSOs\u2019 regular price surveys to enable updates of PPP estimates for non-benchmark years, \nby generating a core and/or primary product list, which will be a subset of the 2005 ICP product \nlist. The RETA would also support the development of NSOs\u2019 expertise in new price collection \nmethodologies introduced during the 2005 ICP and encourage them to participate in  enhancing \nthese methodologies and subsequently adopting them in producing their own price indices and \nindicators. By the end of the RETA, the following would have been achieved: (i) a primary \nproduct list for price collection on a regular basis to enable PPP estimation in non-benchmark \nyears for participating DMCs; (ii) price data for household products for non-benchmark years \nmainstreamed into the consumer price surveys of NSOs; (iii) implementation of recommended \nmethodologies for pricing gross fixed capital formation components; (iv) further development of \nthe capacity of NSOs to  collect more reliable price data inputs for PPP computation; and, \nfinally, (v) an updated PPP generated for 2009 as the selected non-benchmark year.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  To achieve the desired outcome, the RETA will consist of the following activities: (i) \ninvite countries to participate in the RETA; (ii) identify items for the primary product list; (iii) \ncollect  and  validate  price  data,  and  estimate  the  2009  PPP,  including  mainstreaming  the \nhousehold consumption items into the consumer price collection surveys; (iv) improve statistical \ncapacity building; and (v) explore knowledge management systems.. \n \n1.  Inviting Countries to Participate in the RETA \n \n10.  Letters of invitation will be sent to the DMCs that participated in the 2005 ICP  Asia \nPacific to determine their willingness to participate in the new RETA.  \n \n2.  Identifying Items for the Primary/Core Product List  \n \n11.  The core product list will be drawn from the product lists used in computing the 2005 \nPPPs  for  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  Research  will  use  statistical  tools  to  establish  a \nprimary/core product list, which should be about one third of the full list of 656 products priced \nduring the 2005 ICP Asia Pacific. The subset list, while reduced in number, must remain \nrelevant  and  significant  for  the  PPP  computation.    The  possibility  of  including  products \ncharacteristic of the subregions (subregional baskets) in the Asia and Pacific region would be \nexplored, but they will not necessarily be included in the core product list, if doing so would \ndramatically lengthen the list. \n \n3.  Collecting and Validating Price Data and Estimating 2009 PPP  \n \n12.  Price data will be collected for the primary product lists for household consumption \naggregate and construction. Mainstreaming ICP price collection (for household products) into \nthe CPI price collection will maximize the use of CPI price information and of the established \n   ", "4  \norganizational structure for collecting price data in the countries.  These activities, in turn, are \nintended to strengthen general management of data compilation and the overall organization of \nprice collection activities. Like the benchmark figures, household data will be national average \nprices. Construction, prices will be collected for a single period due to the complexity and costs \ninvolved in price collection. For governments, pricing information (compensation) would be \ncollected from NSOs for a single period.   Meanwhile, given the difficulty of collecting prices for \nequipment as experienced in the 2005 ICP, an alternative methodology for pricing equipment \nwill be the subject of research to be undertaken.  For GDP weights, participating countries will \nbe requested to provide data as close as possible to 2009. \n \n13.  Since the quality and reliability of PPP estimates depend on the quality of price data \ninputs used in PPP computation, intra-(within) and inter-country validation will be crucial in \nensuring  product  comparability  and  price  reliability.    The  RETA  will  improve  on  the  data \nvalidation modules used in the 2005 ICP and develop additional procedures for intra- and inter-\ncountry validation of price data.  Data validation workshops, which proved effective during the \n2005 ICP round, would again be convened for this purpose. \n \n14.  Using  the  new  prices  collected  and  prices  generated  from  alternative  pricing \nmethodologies, and updated GDP weights, the 2009 PPP estimates will be generated.  A report \non the 2009 PPPs will be prepared and circulated.  \n \n4.  Building Statistical Capacity  \n \n15.  Statistical capacity building will be at the country level and at the Development Indicators \nand Policy Research Division (ERDI) of ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department. At the \ncountry level, NSOs gained technical expertise (from the 2005 ICP Asia Pacific) in specifying \nand identifying products, conducting price surveys, validating price data, and understanding the \nrudiments of PPP estimation. The RETA hopes to capitalize and build on this preexisting base \nand further hone the NSOs\u2019 proficiency at conducting ICP price surveys and validating price \ndata. Likewise, given the new methodologies adopted during the 2005 ICP, the countries would \nbe  encouraged  to  participate  in  their  enhancement  and  to  eventually  adopt  these  new \nframeworks (i.e., the SPD approach) in producing their own price indices and indicators. The \nRETA would also have established the strategies for mainstreaming ICP price collection into \nnational statistical programs, which will ensure the availability of consistent and comparable \nprice data during non-benchmark years. At ERDI, ADB staff would have developed their skills at \nidentifying a core list of products significant in estimating PPP, sharpened skills in validating \ndata,  and  gained  knowledge  and  expertise  in  developing  and  implementing  alternative \napproaches to estimating PPPs for non-benchmark years. \n  \n5.  Exploring Knowledge Management Systems \n \n16.  Upon successful completion of the RETA, the following would have been achieved: (i) \nparticipating countries would have provided the price data inputs for computing PPP data for \n2009,  (ii)  country  experiences  would  have  shown  the  facilitating  factors  and  problems  in \nintegrating ICP and CPI price data collection efforts, (iii) the methodologies introduced in the \n2005 ICP would have been further refined and more efficiently exploited, and (iv) the 2005 PPP \nwould have been updated to 2009 as the first non-benchmark year estimate. \n \n17.  The  GDP  based  on  the  2009  PPP  will  be  published  and  major  sub-aggregates  of \nparticipating DMCs will be produced.  The publication will be circulated among the NSOs and \nother relevant agencies in the region. To disseminate the RETA output, the results will also be \n   ", "5 \npublished on the ADB website under the economic and statistics webpage as well as the \nwebsites of participating NSOs.  Before the RETA ends, a concluding workshop will be held at \nwhich participating DMCs will present their results and their future courses of action to ensure \nthe sustainability of PPP compilation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $600,000. This amount includes (i) consulting \nservices;  (ii)  training,  seminars,  and  conferences;  (iii)  surveys;  and  (iv)  miscellaneous \nadministration and support costs.  The RETA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program.  The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2  \n \nD.  Implementation Agreements \n \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, with national statistical offices or \nagencies in charge of price collection activities as Implementing Agencies. The administration of \nthe RETA will be handled by the Economics and Research Department. Confirmation of no-\nobjection will be obtained from the government of each participating DMC prior to starting RETA \nactivities in each such DMC, in coordination with their regional departments.     \n \n20.  The RETA will be implemented from September 2008 to August 2010, and will finance \n20  person-months  of  consulting  services  provided  by  2  international  and  18  national \nconsultants. ADB will select and engage individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference of the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nImproving  Price  Collection  of  Non-Household  Expenditure  Components  and  Updating \nPurchasing Power Parity Estimates for Selected Developing Member Countries, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.   \n \n   ", "6  Appendix 1  \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nIncreased  Participating DMCs are able  Workshop documents and  Support from \nharmonization of ICP  to conduct price surveys for  reports, price data  respective DMCs\u2019 \nprice collection activities  the primary product list and  submitted by participating  governments and \nwith CPI price collection  components of gross fixed  DMCs  implementing \nactivities in national  capital formation; updated  agencies \nstatistical offices  PPP estimates are based on \n  prices collected. \n   \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \n1.
