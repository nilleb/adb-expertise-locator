The  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training \n(MOET)  plans  to  introduce  a  3-year  pilot  tryout  of  a  new, \ndiversified upper secondary curriculum starting from the 2002/04 \nschool  year.    The  Project  will  help  improve  the  quality  and \nefficiency  of  upper  secondary  education  by  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s effort to diversify the curriculum and textbooks in \nline with student-centered, active learning methods during the try-\nout  and  revision  period;  and  by  developing  quality  support \nsystems such as trained teachers, improved libraries, and well-\nequipped laboratories, and student assessment. The Project will \npromote  access,  equity,  and  participation  in  upper  secondary \neducation in disadvantaged provinces through (i) school facilities; \n(ii) provision of furniture and equipment; and (iii) study support \nprograms for the poor, ethnic minorities, and girls. The Project will \nalso  strengthen  institutional  capacity,  from  MOET  to  local \nadministration,  by  examining  possible  approaches  to \ndecentralized management of upper secondary education. \n   \nRationale  Primary education became near-universal in 2000\u2014a remarkable \nachievement among developing countries with similar levels of \nper capita income. Expansion of secondary-level coverage has \nalso  been  remarkable.  During  1991\u20131999,  lower  secondary \nschool enrollment grew from 2.7 million to 5.8 million, for a net \nenrollment  rate  (NER)  of  68%.  Upper  secondary  school \nenrollment also expanded rapidly, from about 700,000 to 2 million, \nfor an NER of 32%.  Despite impressive gains in access, much \nremains  to  be  accomplished  to  improve  the  quality  of  upper \nsecondary education. \n \nThe quality of education suffers mostly from limited instructional \ntime and out-of-date memorized teaching and learning methods. \nMOET plans to introduce the new, diversified upper secondary \nschool curriculum, with general curriculum courses designed for \nthe many students who will probably not proceed to the tertiary \neducation level. To improve curriculum relevance to the labor \nmarket, content needs to be linked to industry demands. The \ndiversified curriculum is under preparation, and try-out of new \nteaching methods and instructional materials for grade 10 will \nbegin  in  the  2003/04  school  year.  A  challenge  for  quality \nimprovement is to change classroom teaching and learning to be \nmore active and student centered. ", "iv     \n  Significant disparities in enrollment and cycle completion between \nrural and urban and among ethnic groups appear at the upper \nsecondary  level.  Ethnic  minority  students  are  particularly \ndisadvantaged.  The  Government  needs  to  reach  poor, \nunderserved  groups  by  strengthening  institutional  capacity  in \ndecentralized  education  management  and  by  developing \nadequate regulatory options to manage and monitor nonpublic \nupper secondary schools.   \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The broad objective of the Project is to contribute to poverty \nreduction in Viet Nam through development and improvement of \nupper secondary education. Over the medium term, the Project \nwill  improve  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and \nmanagement  capacity  in  upper  secondary  education,  by \nstrengthening quality support systems nationwide and targeting \nsome of the most economically and educationally disadvantaged \nareas  in  the  country.  The  specific  project  objectives  are  to \n(i) improve quality and efficiency of upper secondary education by \n(a) supporting the Government effort to try out and diversify the \ncurriculum,  textbooks,  and  other  instructional  materials;  and \n(b) developing education quality support systems such as trained \nteachers, improved libraries, equipped laboratories, and improved \nevaluation, student assessment, and quality assurance systems; \n(ii) improve access, equity, and participation in upper secondary \neducation in the disadvantaged areas through school construction \nand replacement, provision of furniture and equipment, and study \nsupport programs for the poor, ethnic minorities, and girls; and \n(iii) strengthen institutional capacity to manage upper secondary \neducation, from MOET to local administration, including provincial \ndepartments of education and training (DOETs), district bureaus \nof education and training, and schools, by examining possible \napproaches to decentralized management. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $80  million  equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties, physical and price contingencies, and \ninterest  charge  on  the  loan.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated at $29.9 million (37.4% of the total cost), and the local \ncurrency cost at $50.1 million equivalent (62.6%).   \n   \nFinancing Plan                                                                                         ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local \nSources  Total Cost  Percent \nExchange  Currency \nADB  29.9  25.1  55.0  69 \nGovernment  0.0  17.0  17.0  21 \nCommunity  0.0  8.0  8.0  10 \n      Total  29.9  50.1  80.0  100 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n     \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 41,615,000 ($55 \nTerms  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources,  with  a \nmaturity term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and \nan interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   ", "    v \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education and Training \n   \nImplementation  MOET will have overall responsibility for project coordination and \nArrangements  implementation. An Interagency Steering Committee will provide \noverall  guidance  for  the  Project  and  help  other  government \nagencies coordinate and liaise with each other. A National Project \nImplementation  Unit  (NPIU)  will  oversee  day-to-day \nimplementation of project activities. A deputy manager and six \nspecialists  for  administration  and  finance,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  civil  works,  procurement,  textbook  and  curriculum \ndevelopment,  and  staff  development  will  assist  the  NPIU \nmanager. Provincial project implementation units (PPIUs), one in \neach  project  province,  will  be  set  up  in  existing  DOETs  to \ncoordinate, plan, implement, monitor, and supervise the Project; \nand report to the NPIU on province-level project activities. \n   \nProcurement  All ADB-financed goods and services will be procured following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement;  and  civil  works  and \nprocurement  of  teachers\u2019  guides  will  follow  government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. International competitive bidding \nprocedures  will  be  applied  to  supply  contracts  for  goods  and \nservices  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  more.  Supply \ncontracts for goods such as vehicles and computers (other than \ninstructional  materials)  of  less  than  $500,000  but  more  than \n$100,000 will follow international shopping procedures. Supply \ncontracts  for  instructional  materials  of  less  than  $500,000 \nequivalent but more than $100,000 will follow local competitive \nbidding (LCB) procedures. Small contracts for minor items of less \nthan $100,000 equivalent may be procured by direct purchase. \nProject civil works will consist of construction and replacement of \nclassrooms and facilities.  All project civil works contracts will be \nawarded on the basis of LCB following government procedures \nacceptable to ADB.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  use  consultants  to  develop  quality  support \nsystems nationally; promote access, equity, and participation in \ndisadvantaged  provinces;  and  strengthen  decentralized \nmanagement of upper secondary education.  Approximately 56 \nperson-months  of  international  and  154  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting will be needed.  The Government will select \nand  engage  all  ADB-finance consultants through a firm using \nquality- and cost-based selection and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n   ", "vi     \nProject Benefits and  The Project will upgrade upper secondary education to produce \nBeneficiaries  graduates  with  the  skills  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the \nVietnamese economy. The Project will improve conditions in the \ncommunity where the project schools are and ensure that upper \nsecondary education is responsive to local needs. Approximately \n45% of all beneficiaries will be female.  \n \nThe beneficiaries of component 1 will be all upper secondary \neducation students (about 5 million during the Project) who will \nhave access to more modern, interesting, and relevant curriculum \nand learning materials. The Project targets approximately 66,000 \nstudents during the pilot try-out, and revision of the curriculum \nand textbooks in 55 upper secondary schools in the 11 selected \nprovinces. While the curriculum is being developed, 100 master \nteachers,  1,000  core  trainers,  and  about  18,600  teachers  will \nreceive training.  About 230,000 poor students will benefit from \naccess  to  improved  instructional  materials.  The  new  technical \nupper secondary schools will benefit employers, who will have a \nsource of well-trained employees, and students, who will have \nmore jobs.   \n \nUnder component 2, poor, ethnic minority, and female students in \nthe  20  disadvantaged  provinces  will  be  direct  beneficiaries. \nProvision of about 1,500 constructed and replaced classrooms \nwill  benefit  approximately  120,000  upper  secondary  students; \n22,500 poor, ethnic minority, and/or female students will attend \nspecial  study  support  programs;  and  1,000  teachers  will  be \ntrained  to  provide  these  programs.  Another  810  teachers  will \nreceive  in-service  training  to  update  their  teaching  skills. \nInformation, education, and communication programs will benefit \nethnic  minority  girls,  who  will  be  encouraged  to  attend  upper \nsecondary schools. \n   \nThe beneficiaries of component 3 will be communities, through \ncloser relationships with their schools, and better-managed public \nand  nonpublic  schools.  Pilot  initiatives  in  community-school \npartnerships and school management in difficult situations will \nlead to efficiency gains and resource mobilization for schools. \nApproximately 1,400 education administrators, school principals, \nand members of community groups and parents associations will \nreceive management training.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project will help the Government introduce a new, diversified \ncurriculum  and  textbooks,  but  not  all  classrooms  will  have \nteachers trained in the new curriculum, textbooks, or instructional \nmaterials at the beginning of the school year.  MOET is aware of \nthe  risk,  and  phasing  the  introduction  of  the  curriculum  and \ntextbooks  will  be  flexible.  The  Project  will  also  build  on  and \ncollaborate with existing systems at the DOET level for in-service \nteacher training, and civil works. During the transition, teachers \nwill continue to rely on familiar teaching methods. However, most \nteachers are willing to accept new teaching methods and will try \nto  adopt them.  Risks involved in  improving  access,  equity,  and  \n   ", "    vii  \n  participation  in  upper  secondary  education  in  disadvantaged \nareas are that (i) qualified teachers and volunteers to conduct the \nspecial study support programs are lacking, and (ii) school sites in \nprovinces  might  not  be  in  the  neediest  areas.  During  project \npreparation, detailed discussions were held with DOETs, and the \nselection criteria carefully developed. To minimize risks involved \nin  civil  works,  PPIUs  will  utilize  the  services  of  provincial \nconstruction  engineers  to  supervise  civil  works  and  budgets, \nundertake fieldwork, and hold consultative meetings.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Upper Secondary Education Development Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance, Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Primary education became near-universal in 2000\u2014a remarkable achievement among \ndeveloping countries with similar levels of per capita income. Expansion of secondary-level \nschool  coverage  has  also  been  remarkable.  During  1991\u20131999,  lower  secondary  school \nenrollment grew from 2.7 million to 5.8 million, for a net enrollment rate (NER) of 68%. Upper \nsecondary school enrollment also expanded rapidly, from about 700,000 to 2 million, for an NER \nof  32%.  In  1994\u20132000, enrollment in lower secondary education grew by 61%, and upper \nsecondary, by 202%. Enrollments of males (53%) and females (47%) are almost on par. Viet \nNam  is  making  good  progress  in  meeting  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  of  universal \nprimary education and gender equality. The Government\u2019s sector policy targets by 2010 are to \n(i) consolidate universal primary education, (ii) universalize lower secondary education, and (iii) \ngradually expand upper secondary education.1 The Government targets a nationwide gross \nenrollment rate (GER) of upper secondary education at 45% in 2005 and at 50% in 2010. \n \n3.  Despite  impressive  gains  in  access,  disparities  exist  by  geographic  location  and \neconomic and social background, and much remains to be accomplished to achieve these \nsector policy targets. \u201cUnreached\u201d and poor groups must be reached, and education quality \nimproved under decentralized education management. Viet Nam remains a low-income country \nwith per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $395 at 2000 prices. Many people are poor, \nwith  45%  of  the  rural  population  living  below  the  poverty  line,  typically  farmers  with  little \neducation, and upland ethnic minorities. Ethnic minority children are particularly disadvantaged. \nIn 1999, 32% of the Kinh ethnic majority but only 8% of ethnic minorities were enrolled in upper \nsecondary schools.2 The gap between the poor and the nonpoor is also significant. According to \nthe Viet Nam Living Standard Survey (1997-1998), the GER was only 9.5% for upper secondary \nstudents from the lowest income quintile, and 75.4% for the highest.3 The poverty-related gender \ngap also widens at the upper secondary school level. In 1999, the female NER was 42.6% in the \n15 provinces with the best enrollment (top quartile), but only 20.0% in the 15 provinces with the \npoorest enrollment (bottom quartile).  \n \n4.  Improving the quality of education is a high policy priority of the Ministry of Education and \nTraining (MOET) in view of the need to develop a creative, flexible, self-motivated, and skilled \nlabor force  for a knowledge- and market-based economy. A new, diversified curriculum and \ncompatible textbooks and instructional materials are thus being developed for upper secondary \neducation.  The  new,  diversified  curriculum  intends  to  encourage  active,  student-centered \nteaching and learning methods. The Project seeks to help the Government develop and improve \nupper secondary education in accordance with government policies, plans, and targets.4  The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1.   \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Education and Training.

Although upper secondary education in Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in \nrecent  years,  the  following  constraints  need  to  be  addressed:  (i)  quality  and  efficiency, \n(ii) access and participation, (iii) affordability and public-private partnerships, and (iv) institutional \ncapacity in management. The sector and subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  The quality of teachers needs to be improved. Although most possess the required \nformal qualifications, teachers badly need skill updating, familiarity with curricular changes, and \nnew teaching methods. In-service teacher training is urgently required.  In-class instructional \ntime is also low by international standards. Classes almost totally rely on teacher lectures. The \nGovernment plans to introduce the upper secondary curriculum, with general curriculum courses \ndesigned for the many students who will probably not proceed to the tertiary education level. To \nimprove relevance of the curriculum to the labor market, content needs to be linked to industry \ndemands. The diversified curriculum is under preparation, and try-out of new teaching methods \nand instructional materials for grade 10 will begin in the 2003/04 school year. A challenge for \nquality  improvement  will  be  to  make  classroom  teaching  and  learning  active  and  student \ncentered. Internal efficiency remains low in upper secondary education. Dropping out and grade \nrepetition are common, particularly in rural and highland provinces. External efficiency is also a \nproblem, as measured by transition rates from one level to the next or by transition from school \nto work.  \n \n7.  Access to upper secondary education is limited to about one third of the age group (15\u2013\n17 years) and is more restrictive for ethnic minorities. Significant disparities between rural and \nurban enrollment and cycle completion are found at the upper secondary education level. In \n1999, NER was below the national average of 32% in predominately rural regions such as the \nNorthern Uplands, Central Coast, Central Highlands, and Mekong River Delta. The GER was \n47.52% in 15 provinces with the best enrollment (top quartile) and only 21.37% in the 15 \nprovinces with the poorest enrollment (bottom quartile). Efforts to promote access and equitable \nparticipation must focus on the provinces, many of which have unique economic and social \ncharacteristics requiring targeted responses to education issues. \n \n8.  Enrollment in nonpublic schools is growing at the upper secondary education level, \naccounting for 34% of total enrollment. Expanding nonpublic schools is an important means to \nfinance  expanded  access.  However,  other  ways  in  which  the  Government  can  support \nexpansion  must  also  be  considered  as  fees  for  upper  secondary  education  burden  poor \nhouseholds,  exceeding  their  annual  nonfood  consumption  outlay.  MOET  and  its  provincial \ndepartments cannot meet all the education expansion and quality improvement objectives and \nthus need to (i) concentrate on investments that will most effectively expand access and raise \nquality; and (ii) develop public-private sector partnerships, including the option of establishing \npurely private schools, especially in affluent urban areas. \n \n9.  Institutional capacity for effective school management needs to be strengthened at the \nprovincial  and  district  levels.  Managerial  capacity  is  weak  in  core  competencies  such  as \nplanning, budget allocation, delivery of in-service training and other teacher support services, \nmonitoring of teacher and student performance, and assessment of learning achievement with \nappropriate  feedback  to  teachers.  National  government  transfers  for  recurrent  budget  and \nprovincial allocations to districts should be rationalized and harmonized. The system could \ncause resource shortfalls, and gaps between local plans and actual transfers.  \n ", "                        3\n       \n10.  ADB  is  supporting  lower  secondary  education  development  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining and lower secondary preservice teacher training development.  Key lessons from the \nongoing lower secondary education projects include the following:  \n(i)  The piloting of new curriculum and textbooks at the upper secondary education \nlevel can be shortened from 2 years to 1 since MOET has gained experience at \nthe lower secondary level. \n(ii)  The textbook loan scheme can generate income for school improvements.  \n(iii)  Capacity-building support is required to strengthen project management and \nimplementation.5  \n \nADB is also supporting the renovation of the vocational and technical education system.6 To \nachieve the targets set forth in the long-term government strategy, and other international \ndevelopment targets, including the Millennium Development Goals, the Government requested \nADB to help prepare the secondary education sector master plan (SESMP) as an analytical tool \nand  decision-making  guide.  The  SESMP  analyzes  issues,  policy  frameworks,  feasible \nstrategies, enrollment projections by province, financing trends, investment priorities with costed \noptions, and an implementation timetable to develop and improve secondary education.  \n \n11.  The European Union is supporting improvements in MOET capacity in sector analysis, \nfinance, and management, including an information system. The World Bank, other agencies \nfrom  Japan  and  the  United  Kingdom,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and \nnongovernment  organizations  have  focused  on  primary  education  and  primary  education \nteacher training. The World Bank is also supporting higher education, together with bilateral \nagencies from Canada, Japan, and the Netherlands.  The Japan International Cooperation \nAgency  (JICA)  is  supporting  a  primary  education  development  plan.  Recently,  the  United \nNations  Education,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  began  helping  the \nGovernment prepare a national action plan for extended education for all (EFA), including early \nchildhood development, primary, lower secondary, and nonformal education. The national EFA \nplanning process will integrate findings and recommendations of JICA\u2019s primary education \ndevelopment plan and of SESMP. External assistance to the education sector is described in \nAppendix 3. \n \n12.  Given  the  strategic  role  of  upper  secondary  education,  MOET  has  identified  three \nprimary  areas  for  its  development:  (i)  improving  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  education; \n(ii) increasing access to education  in poor and rural provinces, and participation of poor and \nethnic  minority  students;  and  (iii)  making  education  management  efficient  through \ndecentralization. Quality improvement is the highest policy priority. ADB\u2019s strategy will support \nthe Government\u2019s vision to modernize the economy and reduce poverty by encouraging pro-\npoor, sustainable growth and structural changes. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program will focus \neducation sector operations on helping the Government achieve universal lower secondary \neducation by 2010 and gradually expand upper secondary education in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s primary areas for its development and improvement.7 This is consistent with \nADB\u2019s past operations and with the emphasis of other aid agencies on consolidating universal \naccess to quality primary education.  \n \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 1997.

The Project will have three components: (i) supporting conditions for quality improvement \nin upper secondary education; (ii) improving access, equity, and participation in upper secondary \neducation in disadvantaged areas; and (iii) strengthening management of upper secondary \neducation.  While  all  provinces  will  be  involved  under  components  1  and  3,  the  20  most \neconomically and educationally disadvantaged provinces will be under component 2. These \nprovinces are Ha Giang, Cao Bang, Lao Cai, Bac Kan, Lang Son and Bac Giang in the North \nEast; Lai Chau, Son La, and Hoa Binh in the North West; Quang Binh on the North Central \nCoast; Quang Ngai on the South Central Coast; Kon Tum, Gia Lai, and Dac Lac in the Central \nHighlands; Ninh Thuan in the South East; and Dong Thap, Kien Giang, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, \nand Ca Mau in the Mekong River Delta.8 Profiles and education data of these provinces are in \nSupplementary Appendix A. Project components are summarized briefly:   \n \n1.    Component 1: Supporting Conditions for Quality Improvement in Upper \n  Secondary Education \n \n15.  The Project will support the policy of improving upper secondary education through \ndevelopment,  testing,  and  dissemination  of  new  curriculums,  textbooks,  learning  materials, \nteaching methods, and support systems, which will be piloted in 11 provinces.9 The support \nsystems  include  learning  support  materials  and  equipment,  student  assessment,  school \nmanagement, and educational leadership and evaluation systems. Eleven technical centers for \ncomprehensive career orientation will be supported in the 11 provinces. Computer and science \nlaboratory equipment, libraries, and teaching materials will also be provided to 20 ethnic minority \nboarding schools (1 for each province) and 61 model schools. Four demonstration schools \nattached to teacher training universities (TTUs) will be upgraded for observation and practice of \nnew teaching methods. The Project will also develop a new model technical upper secondary \nschool (TUSS) and assess demand for it, and its cost-effectiveness. Component 1 has three \nsubcomponents: (i) new curriculum, textbooks, and teaching methodologies; (ii) provision of \ninstructional materials and equipment; and (iii) development of quality assessment systems and \nenhanced education leadership.  \n                                                 \n8   Selection criteria for these 20 provinces are (i) lowest NER in the country, (ii) low GER and female GER, (iii) a large \nnumber of very poor communes and/or low human development index rating, (iv) a high number of ethnic minority \npeople, and (v) relatively high completion rate in lower secondary education but low transition rate to upper \nsecondary education.  \n9  Selection of the 11 pilot provinces will be based on the following criteria: (i) geographical balance\u2014north, central, \nand south provinces; (ii) socioeconomic conditions\u2014rich and poor provinces; and (iii) ethnic background\u2014plain, \nmountainous, and coastal provinces.  ", "                        5\n       \na.  New Curriculum, Textbooks, and Teaching Methodologies \n \n16.  Since 2001, the Government has been revising the curriculum and textbooks, and has \ndeveloped a pilot diversified curriculum for all 14 upper secondary education subjects and is \ndeveloping textbooks. MOET plans to introduce a 3-year pilot try-out period starting from the \n2003/04 school year. Grade-10 curriculum, learning materials, and teaching methods will be \ntested during the year, then revised during the summer break. Grade-11 materials and methods \nwill undergo the same process in 2004/05, and grade-12 materials and methods, in 2005/06. \nNationwide introduction by the Government will follow the piloting and revision for each grade. \nThe Project will support the Government policy of introducing the new diversified curriculum, \ntextbooks, teachers\u2019 guides, and workbooks to around 66,000 students during the pilot try-out \nand revision stage in 55 upper secondary schools in 11 selected provinces. About 2,700 \nteachers and 55 school principals will be trained in student-centered teaching methods. Women \nteachers and principals will be given priority to achieve at least the same proportion of women \ntrainees in the overall pool of targeted teachers and principals. Four demonstration schools will \nbe upgraded for observation and practice of the new teaching methods. A multimedia laboratory \nwill be provided with the latest production equipment to help MOET produce audio, video, and \nother  learning  support  materials.  A  framework  for  the  new  diversified  curriculum  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n17.  National Assembly Decree No. 40 authorizes MOET to develop a new TUSS model. The \nProject  will  support  the  policy  by  developing  a  model  curriculum  and  learning  materials, \nproviding management support, and assessing the relevance of the TUSS model to economic \nand  social  objectives.  Four  TUSSs\u2014two  focusing  on  agriculture  and  two  on  industry  or \nservices\u2014are to be included in the pilot try-out of the TUSS model. The model schools will be \nupgraded and provided with equipment and learning materials.   \n \n18.  Overseas short-term training will also be provided for 16 curriculum development and 16 \ninstructional design specialists from government agencies and/or institutions. The instructional \ndesign specialists will help train 110 curriculum designers and 480 textbook writers. Consulting \nservices will be provided in curriculum development, textbook design, and instructional design. \nCurriculum renovation must also include the development of teaching skills. For this reason, \noverseas  training  will  be  provided  for  16  teacher  trainers  in  especially  designed  3-month \nprograms, which will focus on active, student-centered learning methodologies and combine \nacademic training with practical observation and discussions with teachers. Two groups of eight \ntrainers will be sent to two countries. Trainers will have backgrounds in physics, chemistry, \nbiology, history, geography, mathematics, information technology, Vietnamese language, and \ntwo other specialties. Upon return from their study programs, the core trainers will develop in-\nservice training programs for teachers in the new curriculum and pedagogical methods in \ncollaboration  with  the  Hanoi  University  of  Education.  Training  materials  will  be  produced.  \nNationwide training will be provided for 100 master trainers, 1,000 core trainers, and 10,000 \nteachers in instructional methods and student assessment approaches to effectively deliver the \ncurriculum. Women trainers and teachers will be given priority to achieve at least the same \nproportion of women trainers and teachers in the overall pool of the targeted trainers and \nteachers.  \n \n19.  In the 20 disadvantaged provinces under component 2, in-service training will update the \nskills of 810 teachers in subject areas where they are assigned but not fully trained, and retrain \n3,660 teachers on new teaching methods. The teachers will be identified by the provinces and \nschools.  As the new curriculum and teaching and learning materials will be finalized for grades \n10, 11, and 12, a total of 128 teacher trainers will be trained under the Project. ", "6     \nb.  Provision of Instructional Materials and Equipment \n \n20.  Once the new teaching materials and approaches have been tested and refined, the \nGovernment  will  disseminate  textbooks  nationwide.  However,  the  Project  will  provide \ninstructional materials, teachers\u2019 guides and workbooks to all upper secondary schools that \nserve the poor populations in selected provinces; the schools will receive 120,000 sets of \nlearning  materials,  initially  consisting  of  learning  support  materials  such  as  teaching  aids, \nposters, laboratory supplies, computers, and library materials. Where the shortage of textbooks \nfor  grades  11  and  12  is  severe,  old  textbooks  can  be  provided  temporarily  until  the  new \nmaterials become available in 2005 and 2006, respectively. \n \n21.  Each of the 20 disadvantaged province has an ethnic minority boarding school, which the \nProject will support by providing equipment. The Project will thus help the ethnic minority \nboarding school meet the new standards, including the career orientation needs of ethnic \nminority students, and enhancement of technical skills, especially of ethnic minority students \nwho wish to work after their upper secondary education.  \n    \n22.  The Project will supply equipment and teaching materials for 61 model schools (1 for \neach province), including 2 schools which meet international standard, to the extent required for \nthe diversified and streamed curriculum. The schools will demonstrate the effective use of \ninstructional  aids  and  student-centered  teaching  methods.  The  Project  will  also  provide \nequipment for four TUSSs, which will support courses relevant to local industry\u2019s general \nrequirements  and  to  on-the-job  training  unique  to  specific  industries  and  provided  by  the \nemployers. \n \n23.  The Project will support four demonstration schools attached to TTUs to demonstrate \nteaching methods. The Project will provide the schools with high-standard equipment and \nreplace outdated equipment. \n \n24.  To strengthen career orientation, curriculum, and teaching methods for technical and \nvocational activities, the Project will support the extension of 11 existing centers in 11 try-out \nprovinces. The Project will upgrade existing vocational education centers by transforming them \ninto centers for comprehensive career orientation.  They will provide technical and practical \ntraining for upper secondary school students undertaking optional topics in career orientation. \nThe centers will be equipped for skill training in locally specific activities such as agriculture, \nfishery, horticulture, forestry, engineering, and technology. \n \nc.  Development  of  Quality  Assessment  Systems  and  Enhanced \nEducation Leadership \n25.  Assistance will be provided to develop, try out, and disseminate materials and programs \nto train school managers (principals and administrators) in education leadership, supervision, \nand school management. All public upper secondary school principals will be trained in school \nmanagement and education leadership techniques to support student-centered, active learning \napproaches. New student assessment systems will also be developed. School managers and \nteachers will train in the new assessment techniques after they have been tried out and refined. \nAppropriate education evaluation and quality assessment systems will be disseminated through \nteacher and principal training programs.  \n \n26.  Designing strategies to improve the cost-effective delivery of education in poor and often \npredominantly rural areas is not easy. Ensuring that the curriculum remains manageable for \nteachers and pupils and allows a degree of flexibility for students\u2019 different academic ability ", "                        7\n       \nlevels and aptitudes will require systematic assessment of learning outcomes. Curricular reform \nand development will be accompanied by a pilot assessment of pupils\u2019 performance. Information \nfrom the assessment will help MOET and provincial education leaders understand the extent to \nwhich the reforms are effective. The assessment of learning achievement will be designed to \nreveal  the  individual  student's  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  specific  skill  areas,  and  give \nvaluable feedback to the teacher about how to pace and structure lessons, for example, and to \nthe curriculum developer and textbook writer information about how well students learned what \nwas intended to be taught. The cost of the assessment will be kept low by relying on a \nrepresentative sample of students from participating pilot schools and new curricular areas. \nBaseline data on student performance will be used for comparative estimates of incremental \nlearning across different types of schools with similar student intake. \n \n2.  Component  2:  Improving  Access,  Equity,  and  Participation  in  Upper \nSecondary Education in Disadvantaged Areas  \n \n27.  Component 2 will help the 20 disadvantaged provinces improve access, equity, and \nparticipation. Special programs and support services will be provided for ethnic minority, female, \nand very poor students. Civil works for building new schools and replacing existing classrooms \nwill provide greater access to upper secondary education for these groups. Component 2 has \nthree  subcomponents:  (i)  school  facilities  development;  (ii)  study  support  programs  with \nvocational orientation; and (iii) development of information, education, and communication (IEC) \nprograms. \n \na.  School Facilities Development \n \n28.  Civil  works,  together  with  furniture,  equipment,  and  sanitary  facilities,  will  initially \ncomprise construction of 2,000 schoolrooms, including 1,484 classrooms, 130 libraries, 226 \nscience laboratories, and 160 computer laboratories. Construction and replacement of school \nfacilities in the districts with the poorest communes will be scheduled in each province on a \npriority basis. Assistance to the 20 provinces will be provided in stages, depending upon \nreadiness and need to expand.  Construction and replacement will begin in the second year of \nthe Project and can take place during summer when school is not in session or during the school \nyear if classes will not be disrupted.  Construction will be contracted locally. \n \nb.  Study Support Programs with Vocational Orientation \n \n29.  Special study support programs, including tutorials and vocational orientation, will be \ndeveloped and provided annually for 5,000 very poor, female, and ethnic minority students to \nhelp them keep up with their studies and remain in school.10 The study support programs will be \nprovided by 1,000 qualified teachers and other volunteers. Upper secondary teachers in very \npoor and ethnic minority areas will be targeted and expenses provided for them to deliver these \nprograms. \n \nc.  Development  of  Information,  Education  and  Communication \nPrograms \n \n30.  The reasons for low enrollment of the poor, ethnic minorities, and girls are complex, and \nIEC programs will consider the sociocultural factors and implications of direct and opportunity \ncosts of upper secondary schooling for these groups. IEC programs and materials will be \ndeveloped to encourage families and girls, especially of ethnic minorities, to enter and remain in \nupper secondary schools. Materials will include print (newsletters, posters, handouts) and mass \n                                                 \n10  Further details of the study support programs are given in para. 38. ", "8     \nmedia  (radio  and  television  programming),  and  approaches  such  as  discussion  groups, \nmeetings,  and  teacher  awareness  training.  Twenty  core  volunteer  trainers  selected  from \nteachers, the community, and NGOs will be trained; and 3,600 educators will receive awareness \ntraining. Consultants will develop IEC programs focusing on learning needs of ethnic minority \nstudents and vulnerable girls from poor families, and complementing the Government\u2019s poverty \nreduction efforts to provide scholarships and stipends to the poor, especially ethnic minority \ngirls. \n \n3.  Component 3: Strengthening Management of Upper Secondary Education \n \n31.  Under the decentralized implementation structure, lower levels of administration have \ndecision-making authority to allocate resources. However, Viet Nam faces new challenges in \nstrengthening decentralized education management. Component 3 will support government \nefforts to identify means to decentralize education management. Five pilot initiatives will explore \nnew approaches to financing schools, improving school-community partnerships, identifying \nappropriate administrative roles and responsibilities, managing schools in difficult areas, and \nsocializing (cost sharing in) upper secondary education. Regulatory options to better manage \nnonpublic  upper  secondary  education  will  be  examined,  and  new  information  technology, \nincluding a student-based education management information system (EMIS), will be applied to \nupper secondary school management.  Project activities under component 3 will complement \nthe public administration reform program, which promotes autonomy of MOET and its lower \nadministrative bodies.11 \n \na.  Strengthening Decentralized Upper Secondary School Management \n \n32.  Pilot initiatives in two provinces\u2014one richer than the other\u2014will be selected for each of \nthe five pilot activities dealing with approaches to decentralized management: (i) financing of \nschools,  (ii)  improvement  of  community-school  partnerships,  (iii)  administrative  roles  and \nresponsibilities in a decentralized environment, (iv) management of schools in difficult situations, \nand (v) socializing of upper secondary education in rural and remote areas. Thai Binh, Tuyen \nQuang, Yen Bai, Hoa Binh, Quang Ngai, and Ninh Thuan provinces will host the first three pilot \nactivities. Lang Son province in the North East and Dong Thap province in the Mekong River \nDelta will host the pilot initiatives on school management in difficult situations and socializing of \nupper secondary education in rural and remote areas. Based upon the results of the pilot \ninitiatives,  decentralization  management  training  will  be  provided  to  approximately  1,400 \neducation administrators, school principals, and members of community groups and parents \nassociations.  Such  training  will  be  conducted  in  20  disadvantaged  provinces  involved  in \ncomponent 2, starting from the third year of project implementation.  \n \nb.  Regulatory Options to Manage Nonpublic Upper Secondary Schools  \n \n33.  In view of the recent rapid increase of nonpublic upper secondary schools, the Project \nwill examine the options for regulating and monitoring them, including techniques and training to \nmanage the three types of nonpublic schools (semigovernment, people-funded, and private \nschools). The provinces involved will be Hai Phong in the Red River Delta, and Quang Ninh in \nthe North East.  Based on the findings and a thorough review of experience of other countries, \nthe Government will develop regulatory measures that will concentrate on school outputs rather \nthan on overly restrictive barriers that might inadvertently discourage nonpublic schools.   \n \n                                                 \n11 The Government of Viet Nam. 2001.

Application  of  New  Information  Technology  in  Upper  Secondary \nSchool Management \n \n34.  The Project will develop a new student-based EMIS tracking and analysis system to help \nidentify and support vulnerable children (in and out of school) and assess their progress through \nthe education system. The Project will also use the student-based EMIS to conduct students\u2019 \nassessment, train managers, and provide software for subject teachers in TUSSs. The student-\nbased EMIS will first be developed in two provinces to be identified. The Project will provide \ntraining for 126 EMIS specialists and EMIS equipment to 61 DOETs and MOET. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n35.  A Modular Approach in Diversified Upper Secondary Curriculum. The Project will \nrecommend  modules  such  as  (i) generic  enterprise  and  work  education;  (ii)  health,  sex, \nHIV/AIDS, and gender education; and (iii) computer and information technology. The first will \nprovide  students  with  skills  to  complete  the  transition  from  upper  secondary  schools  to \nemployment or further education and training and to foster the desire for life-long learning.  The \nsecond will mainly help students enter adulthood by developing self-esteem, respect for self and \nothers, rewarding human relationships, and the joy of desired parenthood. The third will teach \nstudents how to use personal computers and computer applications.  \n \n36.  Model Technical Upper Secondary Education. Support for TUSS involves a pilot try-\nout of a new type of institution in Viet Nam. TUSSs will serve a target group not served under \nthe new curriculum and provide a pool of trained persons who may contribute to human capital \nformation  in  unique  ways.  The  assumption  that  students  and  employers  demand  more \ntechnology-oriented education will be examined as part of the project evaluation by referring to \nindicators  of  external  efficiency.    While  the  comparative  analysis  of  external  efficiency will \nrequire  tracer  studies  of  several  years,  the  Project  will  provide  interim  results  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s consideration. Interim results will include, among other things, (i) an analysis of \ncosts  and  learning  achievement  in  TUSS  schools  compared  to  general  secondary  school \nstudents, and (ii) a demand analysis for TUSS among potential students and demand for \ngraduates among employers.  \n   \n37.  Integrated Provision of Upper Secondary Education in Disadvantaged Areas. The \nProject includes several integrated elements in the 20 disadvantaged provinces: (i) in-service \nteacher training for teaching methods based on student-centered, active learning approaches; \n(ii)  provision  of  the  new  curriculum,  instructional  materials,  and  equipment;  (iii)  school \nconstruction  and  replacement,  and  study  support  and  IEC  programs;  and  (iv)  school \nmanagement and EMIS training. An integrated provision of education services by targeting poor, \nethnic  minority,  and  female  students  is  envisaged  to  help  reduce  poverty  in  the  most \neconomically and educationally disadvantaged areas in the country.     \n \n38.  Study Support Programs.  They will target poor students in the 20 provinces under \ncomponent 2. The programs are designed to provide additional opportunities for general study \nand vocational orientation when school is not in session. Three special concerns of the study \nsupport programs are (i) identifying students who need support, (ii) encouraging them to attend \nthe programs given their home and work commitments, and (iii) evaluating the results of the \nprograms.  If  the  programs  can  keep  at-risk  students  in  school,  the  programs  should  be \nexpanded nationwide.  \n \n39.  Student-Based EMIS. An innovation will be introduced to EMIS, which is effective in \ngathering fairly accurate data nationwide, which is not, however, disaggregated by gender, ", "10     \nethnicity, or other important student characteristics. The student-based EMIS is designed to \nallow tracking of individual or groups of students with special learning needs. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n40.  The total project cost is estimated at $80.0 million equivalent, of which an estimated \n$29.9 million or 37.4% is the foreign exchange cost, including $2.4 million interest on the \nproposed loan. The local currency cost is estimated at $50.1 million equivalent or 62.6% of the \ntotal cost. The detailed project cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local \nComponent  Exchange  Currency  Total Cost \n A.

Financing Plan \n41.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 41,615,000 ($55 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to finance 68.8% of the total project cost. ADB will fund 100.0% \nof the foreign exchange cost or 37.4% of the estimated total project cost, and $25.1 million \nequivalent of the local currency cost or about 50.1% of the total local currency cost. The loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The remaining $25 million \nequivalent as counterpart financing or 31.2% of the total project cost will be provided by the \nGovernment  ($17  million)  and  communities  ($8  million),  including  financing  in  kind  by \ncommunities, provision of land for new schools and facilities, provision of materials and labor for \nsmall civil works, taxes and duties, and operation and maintenance of project facilities.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSources  Foreign Exchange    Local Currency    Total Cost  % \nADB  29.9    25.1    55.0  69 \nGovernment  0.0    17.0    17.0  21 \nCommunity  0.0    8.0    8.0  10 \n        Total  29.9    50.1    80.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "                        11\n       \n42.  The provision of financing for local currency cost of about $25.1 million equivalent is \nconsidered  justified  under  ADB's  local  currency  financing  policy.12  From  an  economic \nperspective, assistance is required to meet the local currency cost of development projects \nbecause a low level of per capita income hinders national savings and puts public finance under \npressure. The Government is enhancing revenue collection and improving the efficiency of \npublic expenditure and incentives for private sector participation in revenue-generating public \nsector projects. Although these efforts are expected to increase national savings, a significant \nresource gap will continue for some time because the country needs large capital investments. \nThus, ADB assistance for project-related local currency expenditures is economically justified. \nFrom a technical perspective, the high level of  financing of local currency cost is justified \nbecause (i) many small civil works are scattered over numerous rural sites, which will utilize \nlocally produced construction materials; and (ii) the Project is funding the delivery of in-country \ntraining programs, and recruitment of domestic consultants. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n43.  As Executing Agency, MOET will have overall responsibility for project coordination and \nimplementation. An Interagency Steering Committee (IASC) will provide overall guidance to the \nProject, monitor its activities and outputs, and help coordinate and liaise with other government \nagencies. Members will be MOET representatives, including from the departments of secondary \neducation,  planning  and  finance,  and  teachers;  National  Institute  for  Educational  Science; \nMinistries of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Finance; State Bank of Viet Nam; and Office \nof Government. The IASC will be chaired by a MOET vice minister.  \n \n44.  A  National  Project  Implementation  Unit  (NPIU)  will  oversee  day-to-day  project \nimplementation, and consist of a manager, a deputy manager, and staff appointed by MOET. \nThe NPIU manager will be a member of IASC and report directly to it. Six specialists for \nadministration  and  finance,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  civil  works,  procurement,  textbook \ndevelopment, and staff development will assist the NPIU manager. Other members of the NPIU \nwill be senior staff of concerned MOET departments and institutes, assigned to implement \nproject activities at the central level. Two international consultants (one management advisor \nand one midterm review specialist) and two domestic consultants (one project management \nspecialist and one monitoring and evaluation specialist) will assist the NPIU. It will also have \nadministrative  staff:  secretaries,  translators,  a  finance  officer,  and  other  support  staff.  \nEquipment and operating resources for the NPIU will be provided under the Project. The NPIU \nwill have overall responsibility for project planning, budgeting, monitoring, and reporting; various \nstudies; and coordination of the work of the provincial project implementation units (PPIUs). The \ncurriculum, textbook, in-service training, and other subcomponents will be supported through the \nGovernment\u2019s  scheme  to  implement  the  diversified  curriculum,  and  will  be  managed  and \nimplemented by the NPIU. It will also coordinate the work of consultants.  \n \n45.  Many project activities will be delegated to DOETs, and will be implemented within the \nexisting administrative structure. PPIUs\u2014one in each of the selected project provinces\u2014will be \nset  up  in  existing  DOETs  to  coordinate,  plan,  implement,  monitor,  and  supervise  project \nactivities, and report on them to the NPIU at the provincial level. The PPIU will consist of a \nprovincial  project  manager  and  basic  administrative  staff  designated  from  existing  DOET \npersonnel,  with  support  provided  by  various  specialist  staff  from  provincial  government \ndepartments as required. PPIUs will undertake general project management and implementation \nactivities,  and  be  responsible  for  managing  and  implementing  in-service teacher training, \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1995.

Project management and implementation structure are in Appendix 5.   \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n46.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, from early 2003 to June 2009. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n47.  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  and  procurement  of  teachers\u2019  guides  will  follow \ngovernment procedures acceptable to ADB. The NPIU, in close coordination with the PPIUs, will \nbe responsible for all procurement. The indicative procurement package is in Appendix 7. \n \na.  Equipment and Materials \n \n48.  Supply contracts for goods estimated at $500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding. Supply contracts for goods such as vehicles and \ncomputers (other than instructional materials) of less than $500,000 but more than $100,000 will \nfollow international shopping procedures. Supply contracts for instructional materials of less than \n$500,000 but more than $100,000 will follow local completive bidding (LCB) procedures. Minor \nitems costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by direct purchase. Supply \ncontracts for teachers\u2019 guides may be awarded to the Education Publishing House on the basis \nof  direct  selection.  Details  of  procurement  packages  and  technical  specifications  will  be \nsubmitted for ADB approval before procurement.  \n \nb.  Civil Works \n \n49.  Project civil works will consist of construction and replacement of school classrooms and \nfacilities.  The  estimated  unit  cost  is  $10,000  per  classroom/facility,  including  design  and \nconstruction  supervision.  The  civil  works  are  spread  over  upper  secondary  schools  in  20 \ndisadvantaged provinces. The civil works component will be financed by ADB and government \nand community beneficiaries and will be awarded on the basis of LCB, following government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The PPIU will ensure correct implementation of the civil works.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n \n50.  Provisions for consultants have been kept to a minimum. The Project will use consultants \nto develop quality support systems nationally; improve access, equity, and participation in \ndisadvantaged  provinces;  and  strengthen  management  of  upper  secondary  education.  \nApproximately 56 person-months of international and 154 person-months of domestic consulting \nwill  be  needed.  International  consultants  will  be  needed  for  curriculum  and  textbook \ndevelopment,  teaching  methods,  learning  materials  and  equipment,  evaluation,  and  quality \nassessment (component 1); study support programs (component 2); and EMIS development \n(component 3). Domestic consultants will be needed in curriculum and textbook development, \nteaching  methods,  learning  materials  and  equipment,  evaluation,  and  quality  assessment \n(component 1); IEC, social development, and gender and ethnic minority education (component ", "                        13\n       \n2); and EMIS development (component 3). Project implementation will require the services of \ninternational and domestic NPIU advisers to help set up financial management system, manage \nprocurement, train staff, and coordinate consultants\u2019 inputs. Project implementation will also \nrequire  consulting  services  in  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  midterm \nreview. All ADB-financed international and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged \nby the Government through a firm, using quality- and cost-based selection and in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nconcerning the engagement of domestic consultants. The award of subcontract services for \nADB-financed learning assessment, studies, evaluation, pilot initiatives, or any activity for an \namount  greater  $75,000  equivalent  will  need  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval.  The  NPIU,  under  the \nguidance of the IASC, will act as liaison between ADB and consultants.  Consulting service \nrequirements and outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 8.   \n \n5.  Training  \n \n51.  Extensive in-country and limited overseas training will be provided under the Project with \na total of about 1 million in-country person-days and about 4,500 overseas person-days. In-\ncountry  and  overseas  fellowship  training  programs  will  be  provided  to  upgrade  the  skills, \nknowledge,  and  experience  of  qualified  individuals  who  will  be  implementing  the  project \ncomponents. Overseas short-term training will focus on specialized subjects related to quality \nimprovement programs under the Project. The Government will establish and submit criteria \nacceptable to ADB on the award of overseas fellowships. ADB will be provided with a list of \n(i) the nominated candidates, (ii) their qualifications, (iii) nominated institutions and agencies, \nand (iv) detailed cost of the proposed courses.  ADB approval will be required before the award \nof  overseas  fellowships.  In-country  training  will  be  held  at  MOET/DOET  facilities  or  other \nrelevant training institutions selected from among reputable training institutions, on a contractual \nbasis.  Priority will be given to women participants to achieve at least the same proportion of \nwomen as in the overall pool of the targeted candidates. Staff development (training) program is \nin Appendix 9. \n \n6.  Pilot Initiatives \n \n52.  Component 3 will involve five action-oriented pilot initiatives to be implemented in three \nphases. Phase 1 (design) will begin with a review of regulations and conclude with a review and \napproval of the pilot initiative design by the IASC and NPIU. Phase 2 (implementation) will begin \nwith preparation of programs and materials for orientation/training of provincial staff to be \nincluded in pilot initiatives and conclude with monitoring and evaluation of implementation of pilot \ninitiatives. Phase 3 (reporting) will begin with analysis of the results of pilot initiatives and \nconclude  with  submission  of  the  final  report  with  recommendations.  Pilot  initiatives  are  in \nAppendix 10. \n   \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n53.  The Government will provide funds to MOET through budget allocations. To expedite \nproject implementation through the timely release of ADB\u2019s funds for eligible expenditures, a \ndollar imprest account will be established by the Government, at a commercial bank designated \nby the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB, within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001. The imprest account, with a \nceiling amount of $2.0 million, will be utilized for eligible project expenditures. In view of the large \nnumber of small contracts involved, the statement of expenditures procedure will be used for \nexpenditures of $100,000 or less.   ", "14     \n8.  Accounting and Auditing \n \n54.  MOET will maintain records and accounts to identify goods and services financed from \nthe loan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, statement of expenditures, \nand  imprest  account  records  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  external  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The auditors\u2019 report and copies of the certified accounts and related financial \nstatements, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan \ncovenants, and use of the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure, \nwill be submitted to ADB in English not later than 9 months after the close of the Governments\u2019 \nfiscal year.  The independent external auditing services will be financed from the loan proceeds. \n \n9.   Reporting   \n \n55.  The NPIU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to \nADB within 30 days after each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and \nwill indicate, among other things, the progress made against established targets, problems \nencountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed to resolve problems, compliance \nwith loan covenants, and proposed program of activities for the succeeding quarter. The NPIU \nwill compile the provincial reports into a quarterly report to be submitted to MOET and ADB.  \nWithin 3 months after physical completion of the Project, the NPIU will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report on project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, and impact.   \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n56.  The monitoring and recording system and procedures will be reviewed and improved.  A \nnew project performance management system will be developed and institutionalized within \nMOET to monitor and evaluate implementation performance and development impact at various \nstages  of  the  project  cycle.  Project  performance  monitoring  will  focus  upon  project \nimplementation  plans  and  targets  and  their  execution  and  achievement.  Performance \nevaluations will examine the impact of project interventions (such as improved participation and \ncompletion rates due to civil works or provision of equipment and learning materials, transition to \nhigher levels of education, employment after graduation); problems and constraints faced; and \ntheir reasons and solutions. The NPIU will monitor project activities, using data primarily from the \nprovincial reports and periodic studies. PPIUs will submit monthly, quarterly, and annual reports \non  indicators,  including  training  outputs,  construction  and  replacement  targets,  student \nenrollment and completion targets, and provision of learning materials and equipment. PPIUs \nwill also make monthly visits to field sites supported by the Project, and submit field visit reports \nto the NPIU.  Project performance and monitoring indicators are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n  11.  Project Review \n \n57.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual project reviews to assess \nprogress in each component, identify difficulties or constraints, and help  determine ways to \novercome them. Before each review, the NPIU, in coordination with PPIUs, will prepare a \nprogress report based on the quarterly report and submitted to ADB and the Government.  \n \n58.  ADB and the Government will conduct a midterm review during the last quarter of the \nthird year of project implementation to inform planning for the second half of the Project. The \nmidterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and project implementation arrangements; \n(ii) identify  changes  needed;  (iii)  assess  performance  against  targets  and  benchmarks; \n(iv) review lessons and experiences in upper secondary education development, focusing on the \ncurriculum, textbooks, and teaching and learning methods; (v) review compliance with loan ", "                        15\n       \nagreements;  and  (vi)  recommend  changes  in  project  design  and/or  implementation \narrangements. The findings will be discussed at the midterm workshop to be attended by \nrepresentatives from concerned government agencies, including Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, and State Bank of Viet Nam, MOET, DOETs, the consultants, and \nADB. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n1.  Educational Benefits  \n \n59.  The educational benefits are project outputs that directly or indirectly impact on upper \nsecondary education in particular and the education system in general. The Project will upgrade \nthe upper secondary education subsector to produce educated and skilled graduates who can \nmeet the requirements of the Vietnamese economy nationally and internationally. Enhancing the \nquality  and  efficiency  of  upper  secondary  education  by  providing  better  physical  facilities, \nequipment, and supply of adequate instructional materials will attain this objective. The Project \nwill  support  government-funded  try-out  and  revisions  of  new  curriculum,  textbooks,  and \ninstructional materials in 11 try-out provinces. Improved teacher training and effective classroom \nsupervision, and school management are envisaged to enhance student learning, using student-\ncentered, active learning approaches.  \n \n2.  Social Benefits \n \n60.  The  social  benefits  are  outcomes  that  may  improve  the  social  conditions  in  the \ncommunity where the project schools are located.  Under component 2, the Project will support \nconstruction and rehabilitation of school facilities, including classrooms, toilets, laboratories, and \nlibraries. This support will make access and participation in upper secondary education more \nattractive to the poor, ethnic minorities and girls. Women make up 55% of all upper secondary \nschoolteachers.  Females account for 47% of all upper secondary students. On the basis of \ngender participation in upper secondary education by DOET officials, principals, teachers, and \nstudents, approximately 45% of all beneficiaries will be female. The provision of special study \nsupport programs and tutorials to poor, ethnic minority, and female students will improve their \ncompetitive advantage over the other students.  \n \n3.  Efficiency Benefits \n \n61.  The Project will ensure that upper secondary education is responsive to local needs. The \nProject will, for example, ensure that schools are at least the minimum size and located where \nthey are needed, and that communities are able to maintain and support them.  The Project will \nalso  ensure  that  the  schools  have  learning  materials,  and  educational  leadership  and \nmanagement support. The Project will train new and existing teachers in practical and student-\ncentered teaching methods. The diversified upper secondary schools will focus on optional \nmodules in career orientation; information technology; and health, sex, HIV/AIDS, and gender \neducation. The student-centered teaching methods and other improvements in the instructional \nprocess will raise student learning and add to the perception by students and their parents that \nthey are getting good value for time spent in school, and thus encourage students to remain in \nschool until graduation and continue in successive levels of education. Low internal and external \nefficiencies should be overcome through project interventions.   \n ", "16     \n4.  Direct Beneficiaries \n \n62.  The beneficiaries of component 1 will be all upper secondary education students in the \ncountry (about 5 million during the Project) who will have access to modern, interesting, and \nrelevant curriculum and learning materials. The Project targets approximately 66,000 students \nduring the pilot try-out and revision of the curriculum and textbooks in 55 upper secondary \nschools in the 11 selected provinces. Female students will benefit from gender-sensitive learning \nmaterials. While the curriculum is being developed, 100 master teachers, 1,000 core trainers, \nand about 18,600 teachers will receive training; about 230,000 poor students will benefit from \naccess to improved instructional materials in the 11 selected provinces. Development of new \ntechnical schools will benefit employers, who will have a source of well-trained employees, and \nTUSS students, who will have job opportunities. Under component 2, poor, ethnic minority, \nand/or female students in the 20 disadvantaged provinces will be direct beneficiaries. Provision \nof about 1,500 classrooms either constructed or replaced will benefit approximately 120,000 \nstudents; and 22,500 poor, ethnic minority, and/or female students needing learning assistance \nwill attend special study support programs. One thousand teachers will be trained to provide \nthese programs and will benefit from financial assistance. Another 810 more teachers will \nreceive in-service training to update their teaching skills in the diversified  curriculum.  IEC \nprograms will benefit ethnic minority girls, who will be encouraged to attend upper secondary \nschools. Component 3 will benefit communities by allowing them to form close relationships with \ntheir  schools  and  by  ensuring  that  public  and  nonpublic  schools  are  managed  well.  Pilot \ninitiatives in community-school partnerships and school management in difficult situations will \nlead  to  efficiency  gains  and  resource  mobilization  for  schools.  About  1,400  education \nadministrators, school principals, and members of community groups and parents associations \nwill receive management training. \n \nB.  Financial Sustainability Analysis \n \n63.  The Project\u2019s financial sustainability depends on ongoing reforms of the Government's \neducation finance policy and, to a lesser degree in the short term, on the continued growth of the \nVietnamese economy. Recurrent spending must be at regional standard levels to ensure that (i) \nteachers have incentives to remain in poor provinces, (ii) new teachers are hired to meet \ngrowing enrollment, and (iii) project investments in new and rehabilitated school facilities will be \nproperly maintained. The Project is designed to minimize recurrent cost implications for the \nGovernment and households. The Project will have limited impact on the government budget, \nunder the following assumptions: (i) education expenditure will stay at over 3% of GDP and 15% \nof government expenditure throughout the Project; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs after the \nProject will be maintained at minimal levels ($800,000 per annum thereafter), and increases will \nbe contained through allocation of existing resources.  Of the project cost of $80 million, ADB \nwill finance $55 million, and the Government, $25 million. The Government\u2019s annual share in \nproject cost will average around $4.2 million or D63,000 million equivalent or about 0.2% of the \nupper secondary education average annual budget of about $212 million or D3,200 billion. \nGiven that the upper secondary education annual budget averaged 10% of the total education \nbudget over the last 5 years, the budgetary impact of the estimated annual recurrent costs \nduring  and  after  project  implementation  is  considered  minimal.  A  summary  of  financial \nsustainability analysis is in Appendix 11. \n \nC.  Economic Analysis \n64.  Public and private investment has been substantial at all levels of education for the last \ntwo decades. Increased spending on education at all levels has directly increased access to and \nparticipation  in  it.  From  school  years  1996/97  to  2001/02,  primary  education  enrollment ", "                        17\n       \nincreased by 16%, lower secondary by 37%, and upper secondary by 115%. The Government\u2019s \ngoal is to gradually expand upper secondary education by 2010 to provide the level of human \nresources  required  for  industrialization  and  economic  modernization.  The  socioeconomic, \npolitical,  and  cultural  climate  calls  for  a  redesign  of  educational  objectives,  content,  and \nmethods. To achieve a sustainable level of economic growth and to prosper in a globally \ncompetitive environment, Viet Nam needs to increase its human capital base by raising the level \nof general education together with problem-solving skills and the ability to adapt to a rapidly \nchanging labor market.  The Project will draw the curriculum away from near-total reliance on \nrote  memorization  to  student-centered,  inquiry-based,  and  problem-solving instruction. The \nquality of instructional materials will be improved and matched to the curriculum and teaching \nmethods. Access will be expanded to previously underserved populations, including the rural \npoor, ethnic minorities, and girls. School management will become more efficient and effective. \nThe Project is expected to yield substantial economic benefits. A summary of the economic and \nlabor market analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nD.  Environmental and Social Measures \n \n  1.  Environment and Resettlement \n \n65.  The Project\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed, and no significant adverse impacts \nidentified. However, any environmental consideration will be incorporated into all project-funded \nschool construction and replacement during implementation. The designs of the new schools will \nrequire minimum maintenance. Construction of buildings and replacement of old ones will not \nnegatively impact the environment. Water supply (for drinking and toilets) to promote good \nhealth and environmental sanitation for students and teachers will also be emphasized.  \n \n66.  Construction of new schools will be carried out on vacant public land or commune \nreserve land. In the event no vacant public land is available and community or household land \nmight be needed, a detailed community decision-making process for site selection must be \nstrictly followed to safeguard the communities\u2019 interests. First, the commune will identify possible \nland  through  a  process  of  household  level  consultation,  including  a  process  of  grievance \nredress. Second, the district people\u2019s committee will confirm that (i) the land selected has no \nhousing or enterprises, no encroachers or squatters; (ii) the contribution of  land by any one \nhousehold is not more than 5% of the household\u2019s total landholding; (iii) the contributors are not \npoor; (iv) the commune will guarantee to replace any lost assets at replacement cost and \nreplace any lost income/livelihoods, and compensation to be paid will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement;13 and (v) the people affected will provide verbal or \nwritten agreement to the arrangement. The PPIUs will check each case before the award of civil \nworks contracts that these procedures are followed and provide a written report to ADB together \nwith contract documentation for ADB\u2019s endorsement prior to the award of civil works contracts.  \nADB review missions will make spot checks to ensure that the community site selection process \nhas been followed. \n \n2.  Social Analysis \n \n67.  The Project does not have any adverse social impact. A detailed social analysis was \nundertaken during project preparation. The Project is classified as a poverty intervention and is \nexpected to raise incomes of families in the 20 targeted provinces. Students who graduate from \nupper  secondary  schools  are  likely  to  be  more  productive  than  their  parents  with  lower \neducational qualifications. The improvement of teaching methods, student-centered textbooks, \ndiversified curriculum, student and quality assessment, and educational leadership will benefit \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement (Appendix 1). Manila. ", "18     \nstudents nationally. Updating teaching methods will improve (i) creativity, self reliance, problem-\nsolving ability, flexibility, and life-long learning ability of all students; and (ii) practical knowledge \nand understanding, skills, attitudes, and values to prepare students for further studies and/or \ntraining or jobs. Nationwide, 47% of upper secondary students are females, but lower in the \ntargeted provinces under component 2. Improved access to and participation in education, \nespecially for ethnic minority females, are expected to have significant social consequences \nsuch as widespread adoption of preventive primary health care measures; greater acceptance of \nfamily planning methods; and an understanding of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and \ndrugs. A summary poverty and social strategy is in Appendix 13, and a gender and ethnic \nminorities action plan prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policies on Gender and Development \nand Indigenous Peoples is in Appendix 14.  \n \nE.  Project Risks \n \n68.  The Project covers a diversified curriculum and compatible textbooks, in-service teacher \ntraining, construction and replacement of school facilities, and management activities. With such \na large student population served by so many teachers, not all classrooms will have teachers \ntrained to teach the new curriculum, textbooks, or instructional materials at the beginning of a \nschool year.  MOET is aware of the risk and allows some flexibility in the schedule. The Project \nwill also build on and collaborate with existing systems at the DOET level for in-service teacher \ntraining and civil works. During the transition, teachers will continue to rely on familiar teaching \nmethods. However, most teachers are willing to accept new teaching methods and will try to \nadopt them. Risks involved in improving access, equity, and participation of upper secondary \nstudents in disadvantaged areas are that (i) qualified teachers and volunteers to conduct the \nspecial study support programs are lacking, and (ii) school sites in provinces may not be in the \nneediest areas.  During project preparation, detailed discussions were held with DOETs, and the \nselection criteria carefully developed. To minimize the risks involved in civil works, PPIUs will \nutilize the services of provincial construction engineers to supervise civil works and budgets, \nundertake fieldwork, and hold consultative meetings. \n \nV.        ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n69.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submissions  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation requests and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriate funds \nduring each year of project implementation. \n \n(ii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will \nconduct  initial  baseline  studies  and  surveys  to  establish  appropriate  key \nindicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  project  implementation.  Further,  the \nGovernment, through MOET, will undertake periodic surveys, in the third and \nsixth year of project implementation, to monitor relevant indicators and to institute \nrevision or improvement in implementation schemes, where necessary. \n \n(iii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will have \ndesignated one model upper secondary school for each of the 61 provinces, and ", "                        19\n       \nsubmit to ADB a list containing the names and location of the designated model \nupper secondary schools. \n \n(iv)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will have \nestablished  and  submitted  criteria  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  selection  of \ncandidates for overseas training. \n \n(v)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will \nidentify the first year of school construction and replacement program as set out \nunder component 2 of the Project.  \n \n(vi)  The Government, through MOET, will ensure that new schools to be constructed \nare precisely located by school mapping in areas requiring access for lower \nsecondary graduates from poor, ethnic minority and disadvantages areas, and \nthat the school mapping is completed at least 1 year prior to construction of new \nschools. Further, the Government, through MOET, will submit to ADB the details \nof school construction and replacement program at least 1 year prior to the \ncommencement of the program. \n \n(vii)  The Government and the MOET will ensure that construction of new schools will \nbe carried out on vacant public land or commune reserve land. In the event no \nvacant  public  land  is  available  and  community  or  household  land  might  be \nneeded,  a  detailed  community  decision-making  process  for  site  selection  as \nspecified in the project design must be strictly followed. Further, in the event \ncompensation must be paid, as a consequence of the use of community or \nhousehold land, the Government will ensure that compensation will be paid in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure the continuation of the existing textbook lending \nscheme to ensure that improved textbooks for the new curriculum are made \naccessible to poor and disadvantaged students in all priority provinces. \n   \n(ix)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will \nsubmit to ADB the names of the participating provinces in the pilot initiatives as \nrequired under component 3 of the Project. \n \n(x)  The Government will establish, by the end of 2005, a student-based EMIS that \nwill enable the tracking of upper secondary graduates in both higher education \nand  the  work  environment  and  generate  feedback  for  improving  the \nimplementation of diversified curricula.  \n \n(xi)  The Government, through MOET, will ensure priority be given to the gender and \nethnic minority development through the implementation of the gender and ethnic \nminorities action plan, prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Policies on Gender \nand Development and Indigenous Peoples. The Government, through MOET, will \nfurther ensure that (a) in selecting the participants for all training activities, priority \nwill be given to women to achieve participation of women in each training activity \nat a level at least proportionate to their representation in the groups of candidates \nfrom among whom the selection is made; and (b) in order to increase the quality \nand access of upper secondary education received by ethnic minorities, ethnic \nminorities will have equal opportunities to participate in training activities. The ", "20     \nProject\u2019s impact on ethnic minorities will be observed during project monitoring \nand evaluation. \n \n(xii)  Although no significant environmental impacts were identified, the site selection, \ndesign, construction, replacement work and operation of school facilities will be \nimplemented in line with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n70.  Before loan effectiveness, the following will have been completed: \n \n(i)  The members of the IASC will have been appointed.  \n \n(ii)  Project finance specialist, project civil works specialist, and project procurement \nspecialist of the NPIU will have been appointed. \n \n(ii)  Eleven pilot provinces will have been selected and designated for try-out of new \nupper secondary curriculum and textbooks. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n71.  Before any disbursement, the following will have been satisfied: \n \n(i)  DOETs will have appointed the members of the PPIUs at least in 20 provinces \ndesignated under component 2 of the Project. \n \n(ii)  DOET, through MOET, will have submitted to ADB, a letter from each of the 20 \nprovinces confirming their commitment to participate in the Project and for the \nprovision of budget to maintain project facilities. \n \nVI.

The education system in Viet Nam consists of 5 years of primary, 4 years of lower \nsecondary,  and  3  years  of  upper  secondary  education,  followed  by  4\u20136 years of higher \neducation.  Education  administration  is  shared  among  the  central,  provincial,  and  district \ngovernments,  and  communes,  with  centralized  decision  making  and  decentralized \nimplementation. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) is responsible for all policy \nformulation, guidance, and supervision. Upper secondary education is administered by the \nprovincial department of education and training under the supervision of MOET and provincial \npeople\u2019s committees. The Government is the main provider of upper secondary education in \nrural and remote areas, while upper secondary-level enrollment is increasingly covered by \nnonpublic schools, especially in urban areas.  \n \n2.  The  general  public  education  system  has  expanded  rapidly  over  the  last  decade. \nPrimary education is nearly universal, with the net enrollment rate at 95% in 2000. In 1994\u2013\n2000, lower secondary education enrollment increased by 61%, and upper secondary education \nenrollment, by 202%. In 2001/02, 2.3 million students were enrolled in upper secondary schools, \nand the gross enrollment rate (GER) was 38%. While enrollment in lower secondary schools will \npeak in 2006 and begin to decline due to the falling number of children in the lower secondary \nschool age bracket, upper secondary education enrollment is projected to increase through \n2010.1 The Government targets a nationwide upper secondary education GER of 45% in 2005 \nand 50% in 2010. \n \n3.  In many of the 61 provinces, the 2005 target for upper secondary enrollment has already \nbeen or will be attained. However, the top-quartile and bottom-quartile provinces have different \nenrollment rates. The 15 provinces with the lowest enrollment rates have the greatest poverty, \ndifficult topography, and a larger proportion of ethnic minorities than the 15 provinces with the \nhighest enrollment rates. The average GER for upper secondary education was 47.5% in 2000, \nbut only 21.4% in the bottom-quartile provinces. Efforts to increase participation in upper \nsecondary education should clearly focus on the provinces with the most difficult conditions. \nEquity in providing upper secondary education has also improved. Female gross enrollment \nincreased from 21% in 1996/97 to 27% in 1999/00. However, regional disparities in gender \nequity are also a problem. Female GER in the top quartile was 42.6% but only 20.0% in the \nbottom quartile. More poor children are in upper secondary school, but their participation \nremains low. In 1998, 64.1% of children from the richest quintile (20%) of the population were in \nupper secondary school but only 4.5% from the poorest.  \n \n4.  Repetition  and  dropout  rates  have  improved  nationwide  in  the  past  decade.  The \ncompletion rate in upper secondary education rose from 61.7% in 1991/92 to 78.4% in 1999/00. \nHowever, in the lowest quartile, repetition and dropout rates increased from 1996/97 to 1999/00. \nFor the highest and lower quintiles, student-teacher ratios were similar at around 30:1 in \n1999/00, as were student-class ratios. The ratio of teachers per class showed a wider disparity. \nThe  standard  is  two  teachers  per  class  for  upper  secondary  education.  The  top-quartile \nprovinces have 1.6, but the lowest-quartile provinces have only 1.0.  \n \n5.  Public expenditure for education has increased significantly from 1.8% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in 1992 to 3.5% in 1998, but the picture is incomplete without reference to \nanother  dramatic  increase:  in  private  contribution.  Household  expenditure  on  education \nincreased from 1.7% of GDP in 1992 to 3.4% in 1998. In 1998, the private share of expenditure \non upper secondary education was 69%, placing Viet Nam near the top of all countries in this \ncategory and illustrating how great demand is as well as the Government\u2019s inability to finance \n                                                 \n1  ADB and MOET. February 2002. Secondary Education Sector Master Plan (Final Report), Volume I: Main Report. \nHanoi. \n   ", "26    Appendix 2 \nexpansion from purely public resources. Expenditure per student or unit cost of primary and \nlower secondary education is nearly the same\u2014a departure from the typical case, where each \nsuccessive level is much more costly than the previous one. Expenditure per student for upper \nsecondary education was lower than that for lower secondary education in 2000/01 (D260,000 \nvs. D264,000).  High household outlay to meet children\u2019s education needs does not denote the \npresence of either private schools or even high levels of household involvement in school \naffairs, which are low.  \n \n6.  Few direct indicators are available to assess education quality. Enrollment expansion \ndoes not mean student learning. Because Viet Nam has no tradition of periodic assessments of \nlearning achievement, how much of the curriculum is mastered by which students is unknown.  \nHowever, indirect indicators include (i) qualified teachers, who make up 95% of all teachers; and \n(ii) study hours per week (31.59) for the 35-week school year, or about 800 hours per year, \nwhich is low by international standards (900\u20131,200 hours per year). Depending on the indicator \nused, therefore, Viet Nam ranks low or high. Physical facilities are inadequate and frequently in \npoor repair. Other facilities such as desks, bookshelves, and so forth are either lacking or in \npoor condition. Less than 20% of schools had chemistry, biology, or language laboratories. Only \n25%  had  physics  laboratories.  Boarding  and  specialized  schools  had  the  most  facilities, \nfollowed by public schools. Semipublic and people-founded schools had the least amount of \nfacilities. Nearly all specialized, boarding, and public schools had computer laboratories.  \n \n7.  MOET places high priority on improving education quality to prepare a creative, flexible, \nself-motivated, and skilled labor force. A diversified curriculum and compatible instructional \nmaterials are being developed for upper secondary education to encourage active student \nlearning and student-centered instruction, but similar objectives for lower secondary education \nhave not had the same results. A much-improved system for in-service teacher training will be a \nkey to attaining this objective. A try-out of the new curriculum and materials, as well as \nsupportive systems for school management and student learning assessment, is planned for \n2003\u20132006.  \n \n8.  Another important objective is increased participation in upper secondary education. To \nreach the target of 45% GER in 2005 and 50% in 2010, the focus should be on provinces with \nthe most difficult conditions and serving the rural poor population, a large proportion of which is \nmade up of 54 minority groups. In 1998, ethnic minorities represented 14.2% of the population \nbut 28.5% of the poor. They are most numerous in the Northern and Central highlands and the \nMekong River Delta. Bringing ethnic minorities into the secondary education mainstream will \nensure equitable social and economic development.  \n \n9.  In accordance with policy directions under public administration reform for 2001\u20132010,2 \ndecentralized education management will continue to be explored. New approaches to finance \nschools  and  improve  school  and  community  partnerships  should  result  in  better  student \noutcomes and lower overall costs.  More community participation will also allow students and \ntheir families to match their education to their abilities and their long-term economic and social \naspirations.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  The Government of Viet Nam. 2001.

Over the last 10 years, economic growth in Viet Nam has averaged a robust 7.4%, \nhelping finance increased government expenditure on education from 1.8% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in  1992 to 3.5% in 1998. One result has been near-universal primary-level \ncoverage and rapid expansion of lower and upper secondary school enrollment. Government \npolicy calls for increasing the net enrollment ratio of primary school students to 99% in 2010, \nand  gross  enrollment  of  lower  and  upper  secondary  school  students  to  90%  and  50% \nrespectively. However, as with most rapid expansion elsewhere, resources to sustain expansion \nat acceptable levels of quality are constrained. Additional spending for infrastructure expansion \nand  current  budget  increases  are  needed  for  curricular  development  and  diversification, \ntextbook quality and availability, teacher education and pedagogical methods, and vocational \nand  technical  education.  Provinces  are  to  be  financially  responsible  for  upper  secondary \neducation infrastructure with central budgetary aid to the poorest areas. Nongovernment school \nfinancing, already high, is to be further increased. Management is to be decentralized to the \nprovincial and district levels with assistance and training as required.  \n \n2.  Education and training sector spending by level are as follows: primary education, 38%; \nlower secondary education, 20%; upper secondary education, 8%; and the remainder is for \ntraining expenditures. Upper secondary school enrollment is expected to increase substantially, \nrequiring changes in intersectoral allocation during the project period.1 Capital and recurrent \ncosts comprise about 30% and 70%, respectively. Salaries consist of 60% of recurrent costs, \nwhich  go  primarily  to  teachers\u2019  salaries.  At  the  school  level,  funds  are  raised  through \nconstruction fees paid by parents and other contributions to augment the construction and \nmaintenance of facilities. Teachers\u2019 salaries are low by international comparison and teachers \nneed at least two jobs. Although the budget for 2000/2001 provides for increased teachers\u2019 \nsalaries, these only make up for the losses that occurred during the financial crises. From the \nViet Nam Living Standards Survey, 1997-1998, the average expenditure per pupil at the upper \nsecondary level is D1.2 million ($97).2 Private costs to education are about 60% of the cost of \neducation to parents.  \n \n3.  The Project will address some education financing issues. It has been designed to \nminimize recurrent cost implications for the Government and community. The improvement of \nthe quality support systems under the Project is intended to reduce wastage, improve the \ninternal efficiency of upper secondary education, and reduce the cost of producing a graduate. \nThe incremental recurrent project costs arise largely from increased access to schools. The cost \nof textbooks has been minimized by improving their design, and quality for reuse. Cost recovery \nfrom parental purchases of textbooks is proposed under the textbook loan scheme. Although \nnew construction and renovation of schools are being financed, sustainability is being ensured \nby the local community\u2019s commitment to operate and maintain the schools. \n \n4.  The  financial  sustainability  analysis  evaluates  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \ngovernment  budget.  The  total  financial  cost  of  the  Project,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties, \ncontingencies, and interest charges, is $80 million for a approximately 6 years.

The fiscal impact of the Project shows that it will have \nvery limited impact on the government budget under the following assumptions: (i) education \nexpenditure is maintained at over 3% of GDP and 15% of government expenditure throughout \nthe project period; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs after the Project are maintained at \nminimal levels ($800,000 per annum thereafter), and increases are contained through allocation \nof existing resources. \n \n5.   From the total project cost of $80 million, the Government will finance about $25 million \nof  the  total  project  cost  and  a  maximum  of  30%  of  the  development  expenditures.  The \nGovernment\u2019s annual share in project costs will average about $4.2 million or D63,000 million \nequivalent during the Project, or about 0.2% of the upper secondary education average annual \nbudget of about $212.0 million or D3,200 billion annually. The upper secondary education \nbudget is projected based on increased enrollment in upper secondary education during the \nProject, consistent with historical growth in the subsector. The recurrent costs to be borne by \nthe Government during the Project are estimated to be about $800,000 per year and include \n(i) the  operating  expenses  of  the  project  implementation  unit,  and  (ii)  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  new  and  replaced  school  facilities  and  equipment.  Given  that  the  upper \nsecondary education annual budget averaged 10% of total education budget over the last 5 \nyears, the budgetary impact of the estimated annual recurrent costs during and after project \nimplementation is considered minimal (Table A11.1).   \n ", "Table A11.1: Financial Sustainability Analysis  4\n6\nActual and Projected, 1998\u20132013   \n \n  Actuala  Budget Planned

MARKET ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Justification \n \n1.    Public and private investment at all levels of education in Viet Nam has been substantial \nover the last two decades. Increased government and household spending on education at all \nlevels has had direct impact on access and participation. From 1996/97 to 2001/02, enrollment \nin primary schools increased by 16%; in lower secondary, 37%; and in upper secondary, 115%. \nThe  Government\u2019s  goal  is  to  expand  upper  secondary  education  by  2010  to  promote \nindustrialization and economic modernization. Quality improvement is of the highest priority. The \nsocioeconomic, political, and cultural climate of the country calls for improvement of education, \nincluding curriculum and teaching methods. To achieve a sustainable growth path and to \nsurvive in a globally competitive environment, the country needs to build a dynamic human \nresource base with adaptable skills. Investment in education under the Project consists of \nimproving  quality,  promoting  access  and  participation,  and  increasing  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of education management through management training, decentralization, and \nimproved fiscal transfers. The Project is expected to yield substantial economic, social, and \ninstitutional benefits.  \n \nB.  Labor Market Demand  \n \n2.    Viet Nam\u2019s population is now about 78 million, having doubled in the last 30 years. \nGross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  during  the  last  decade  averaged  7.4%  annually. \nPopulation growth will result in further increase in the working-age population in Viet Nam. The \nlabor demand projections1 indicate that the 38.6 million labor force in 2000 will increase to 45.7 \nmillion in 2010, representing an average annual growth rate of 1.8%. By 2010, the working-age \npopulation will account for around 51.0% of the total population as compared to 46.7% in 2000. \nDespite strong economic growth, employment growth lagged behind. The labor-intensive and \nexport-oriented  domestic  private  sector,  although  growing  quickly,  is  still  small.  This \nemployment structure remains largely dominated by agriculture, with labor shifting from the \npublic and cooperative sectors toward household enterprises/farms that do not use salaried \nworkers, and toward independent labor. \n \n3.    The labor market in Viet Nam continues to be predominantly unskilled, agricultural, or \nhousehold workers2. In 2000, the educated and trained labor force comprised only 15.3% of \nemployed  persons  (at  the  technical  professional  level).  The  labor  market  will  continue  to \nincrease by 3%, which means that every year another 1.4 million people will enter the labor \nmarket. These are young, often unskilled workers with minimal experience, who live in rural \nareas where land and nonfarming jobs are scarce. Those who will not be absorbed by the \nformal sector will continue to work in household enterprises. If the private sector does not \ndevelop  significantly,  unemployment  will  increase,  especially  as  state  enterprises  and  the \nagriculture sector employ fewer people, and because the absorptive capacity of the labor-\nintensive,  low-productivity  tertiary  sector  is  low.  The  Government,  while  dismantling  its \nmonopoly in employment, has not invested sufficiently in retraining, which has been left to \nindividual initiative.  \n \n4.  The transition to a market economy, and rapid economic growth in the last decade have \nraised the demand for skilled labor. Growth promises to be more labor intensive. Given its rich \nnatural and human resources, Viet Nam can triple manufacturing exports and create around 1.6 \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs. 2001. Vocational Training Development Strategy 2010. Hanoi. \n2  In 2000, 84.6% of the labor force was unskilled and 63% in agriculture.  ", "48    Appendix 12 \nmillion manufacturing jobs in export sectors in the near future. To be competitive, however, Viet \nNam must develop the high-technology sectors and upgrade its labor force. Upper secondary \neducation is particularly important to foster the needed labor skills and the capacity to learn on \nthe job while adapting to new technologies. Measures must mitigate the poverty and inequality \nthat may worsen with increasing globalization. Viet Nam\u2019s comparative advantage is likely to be \nin sectors and enterprises that require relative shifts in the skill content of export manufactures; \nsteady increase in labor-intensive products; and dramatic increase in science-based goods, \nincluding those that are technologically complex. \n \nC.  Economic Rates of Return and Project Benefits \n \n5.  The economic benefits will potentially include high social returns from the investment \nthrough (i) improved efficiency of infrastructure and personnel, and in allocation of resources; \nand (ii) improved productivity of graduates. The major economic benefits of the Project lie in its \ncontributions  to  improving  the  internal  efficiency  of  upper  secondary  education.  The  new \ncurriculum and teaching methodologies based on active student-centered approaches to be \nintroduced by the Project will enable the newly trained teachers to interact more with students, \nthus helping improve the performance of their students. Teachers will be upgraded in areas \nwhere they have had no preservice training, and principals will be trained in new approaches to \nschool leadership and management training. The Project will also develop comprehensive \nevaluation and assessment procedures, formative and summative. The Project is expected to \nincrease the number of upper secondary school graduates to over 500,000 annually. The \nProject will directly improve the quality of outcomes and performance of graduates in the labor \nmarket. The Project will provide the means to raise academic standards and help improve the \nalignment  between  graduate  skills  and  the  labor  market.  Increased  earning  capacity  and \nspending ability of low-income groups will help reduce poverty. \n \n6.  Demand Analysis. Lower and upper secondary education has rapidly expanded since \n1994. From 1996 to 1999, upper secondary education enrollment increased from about 1.2 \nmillion to 2.0 million, for a net enrollment rate (NER) of 32%.  In the 15 provinces with the \nhighest NER, the number of secondary schools increased by 38.1%, and enrollment by 78.6%. \nIn 15 provinces with the lowest NER, the number of schools increased by only 30.3%, and \nenrollment by 128.0%. Enrollment differs significantly, however, among income groups. Upper \nsecondary education NER among the richest 20% of households in 1998 was  64.1%, while \namong the 20% poorest households it was a mere 4.5%. The low enrollment rates among the \npoor are attributable to the high direct private costs to education and the indirect (opportunity) \ncosts of upper secondary education. In view of government plans to expand primary, and lower \nand upper secondary enrollment by 2010, significant public (and private) resources will be \nrequired at all levels.  \n \n7.    Reverse Cost-Benefit Analysis. Expected benefits from productivity differential and \nreduced costs are based on the expected minimum. Total project benefits are estimated at \nabout $19 million per year based on reduced costs and productivity differentials (Tables A12.1 \nand A12.2). In considering the benefits of education, \u201cswitching values\u201d are useful in the \nabsence of reliable data on earnings differentials. The analysis, sometimes referred to as \nreverse cost-benefit analysis, consists of estimating the productivity differential required for an \neducation  investment  to  have  an  acceptable  rate  of  return.  The  Project  has  few,  if  any, \nquantifiable objectives for which future monetary benefits can be estimated, but it does have \nmultiple objectives and multiple inputs toward reaching them. The Project is an investment to \nredirect and improve an existing upper education system. The Project is not just a series of \ndiscrete investments aimed at particular goals but a systemic approach using a combination of ", "                      Appendix 12  49\n         \npolicy changes and new investments to improve upper secondary education.

", "50    Appendix 12 \n7.  The approach used in the economic quantification is to estimate some minimum rate of \nreturn  based  on  the  least  that  one  can  expect  from  the  proposed  investments  in  upper \nsecondary education. With a minimum hurdle rate of 12% (real rate of return), the Project can \nbe deemed a good investment. The rate-of-return approach is based on organizing on an \nannual basis the different project activities or interventions. Where possible, the expected \neffects have been summarized in monetary terms either as cost reductions (such as producing \nthe same output at a reduced overall cost) or increased benefits (such as producing more \ngraduates who earn more because they are better educated and/or more equipped to contribute \nto the global economy). These benefits exclude externalities that accrue to the Project. \n \n8.   Productivity differentials are computed based on the number of projected graduates from \nthe secondary education sector master plan (SESMP)3 multiplied by the differential earnings \nfrom the mean and median average income. The Viet Nam Living Standards Survey, 1997-1998 \n(VLSS98)4 shows that the median average for the seven regions with educational attainment \nless than primary diploma and lower secondary diploma comprises 70% of population. The \ndifference between the median and mean income is the productivity differential of the upper \nsecondary education graduates under the Project, assuming 78% completion rate. About 40% \nof graduates are expected to benefit from the productivity differential. \n \n9.    Key Benefit Assumptions. Reduced costs are the yearly savings expected as a result \nof  strengthening  management  of  upper  secondary  education.  The  Project  is  expected  to \nimprove cost-effectiveness by increasing capacity utilization of upper secondary education \nschools,  reducing  the  unit  cost,  and  strengthening  the  management  of  upper  secondary \neducation at the provincial and school levels. The expected cumulative savings are assumed to \nbe about 1% of annual recurrent costs of upper secondary education. \n \n10.  Productivity differentials\u2014benefits from increased earnings or inflows\u2014will result from \nimproved productivity of graduates. The quality improvement measures and teacher training are \nexpected to increase earnings of new graduates based on the better education that they will \nreceive through the Project. Benefits will come from increased earnings because students have \nbeen directed into subjects for which demand is greater. Better-qualified teachers and student-\ncentered  approaches  will  improve  student  performance  and  thus  improve  the  quality  of \ngraduates and the workforce. VLSS98 data on education and income was used to calculate \nproductivity differentials. \n \nD.  Cost-Effectiveness and Internal Efficiency \n \n11.  A key element of cost-effectiveness of education spending is per student or unit cost. \nAccording  the  SESMP,5  the  public  cost  per  pupil  in  2000/01  was  D254,000  for  primary \neducation; D264,000 for lower secondary; and D260,000 for upper secondary. Upper secondary \neducation public expenditure is increasing, but is relatively modest compared to expenditure in \nprimary and lower secondary education. Public expenditure per student is only slightly above \nexpenditure per pupil at the primary level and less than the cost per pupil at the lower secondary \nlevel. This is possible due to the relatively large share of total costs borne by individual \nhouseholds as described below. In most countries, however, public expenditure per pupil \nincreases significantly at each successive education level.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB and the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET). 2002.

The Government has continued its efforts at cost recovery (shifting costs of education \nfrom  the  Government  to  individuals  and  families)  by  encouraging  the  establishment  of \nsemipublic programs and nonpublic schools requiring fee payments at the upper secondary \nlevel.6 The consequence has been a rapid increase in the private costs of education from a per \ncapita expenditure of D32,700 in 1993 to D108,400 in 1998. In 1998, the private share of upper \nsecondary education expenditure represented 69% of the total expenditure. In 1993, the private \nexpenditure share was 57%. According to VLSS98, the average per pupil expenditure per year \nwas D557,500 ($45) at the lower secondary level and D1.2 million ($97) at the upper secondary \nlevel. Public unit cost per student at all levels is almost equal, resulting in the provision of low-\nquality  higher-level  education.  This  indicates  that  improvements  in  teacher  quality,  and \ncurriculum, textbook, and other quality reforms, are the most important and cost-effective \neducational spending to prepare students for higher education or the labor market. It makes \ngood economic sense that various activities planned under the Project aim to improve quality. \n \nE.  Beneficiaries \n \n13.  A large number of teachers and principals will benefit from the new and improved in-\nservice training programs: 18,600 teachers trained in new teaching methods (component 1); \n1,000 teachers retrained and upgraded (component 2); and about 1,400 school principals \ntrained in school management and education leadership (component 3). The Project will directly \nbenefit about 25% of the teaching and administrative staff at the districts and schools through \ntraining,  leading  to  enhanced  capacity  and  improved  efficiency,  and  upgraded  school \nmanagement  skills.  About  5  million  upper  secondary  education  students  will benefit from \nimproved student assessment, testing, education evaluation, and quality assurance. Public and \nprivate  upper  secondary  education  institutions  will  benefit  from  improved  student-centered \ncurriculum,  teaching  methods,  textbooks,  and  instructional  materials  in  key  subject  areas. \nStudents  will  benefit  from  enhanced  quality  and  quantity  of  education  inputs,  leading  to \nimproved  education  achievements  and  higher  returns  to  private  investment  in  education. \nEducational reforms will be supported through participatory policy studies, study visits, and \nexternal training of key staff. Under component 2, about 120,000 disadvantaged students in 20 \nselected  provinces  with  low  participation  rates  will  benefit  from  the  new  construction  and \nreplacement of classrooms, and equipment provision. The teaching and learning environment \n(i.e.,  conditions  of  facilities  and  availability  of  instructional  equipment,  teaching  aids,  and \nmaterials) will be improved. Study support programs will benefit about 22,500 poor and ethnic \nminority students.  \n                                                 \n6  Public upper secondary education is supposedly free (but in actuality there are costs). Semi-public students pay \ntuition and a construction fee among others. Students in nonpublic schools pay  a higher tuition and perhaps \nconstruction fee. Provincial peoples\u2019 committees set the fee levels within the range established by the Government.  ", "52 Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

Yes  Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement?         Yes \nPartnership agreement signed. \nContribution of Sector/Subsector to Reduce Poverty: \n \nThe upper secondary education subsector is geared to reduce poverty in Viet Nam by promoting greater access to \nupper secondary education nationally and for females, especially those from poor and ethnic minority backgrounds. \nThe poor and ethnic minorities, for various cultural and economic reasons, are underrepresented in upper secondary \neducation. The provision of upper secondary education includes general upper secondary education curriculum \ntogether with career orientation and technical training focusing on local industry requirements, thus providing \nstudents with skills to help them get jobs and overcome transgenerational poverty. \n \nViet Nam's lower and upper secondary education has expanded rapidly since 1994. From 1991 to 1999, upper \nsecondary enrollment increased by 101.2% from 700,000 to 2 million, for a net enrollment rate (NER) of 32% in \n1999. In the 15 provinces with the highest NER, secondary schools increased by 38.1%, and enrollment, by 78.6%. \nIn the 15 provinces with the lowest NER, schools increased by only 30.3%, and enrollment, by 128.0%. However, \nsignificant differences in enrollment remain among income groups. NER in upper secondary education among the \nrichest 20% of households in 1998 was 64.1%, while among the 20% poorest households, a mere 4.5%. The low \nenrollment rates among the poor are due to the high direct private costs of education, and the indirect (opportunity) \ncosts of upper secondary education.  \n \nThe Project will address issues concerning access to and participation in upper secondary education. The provinces \nrecommended for component 2 promote access, equity, and participation in upper secondary  education in the \ndisadvantaged provinces in the North East, North West, North Central Coast, South Central Coast, Central \nHighlands, South East, and Mekong River Delta.  \n \nB.            Poverty and Social Analysis                                      Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n                                             Human Development \n                                                                                                                                                Gender and Development \n \nViet Nam has an overwhelmingly rural population (59 million in 2000). The population grew from just over 66 million \nin 1990 to slightly over 77.6 million in 2000,1 or an increase of 17.5%. The female population increased from 33.8 \nmillion to 49.5 million, and the male population from 32.2 million to 38.2 million. The annual per capita income in \n1994 was D2 million ($134) and D3.5 million ($236) in 1999. In the rural areas, the annual per capita income in 1994 \nwas D1.7 million ($113), and D2.7 million ($180) in 1999. However, stark differences exist between rural and urban \nareas, and between the lowest and highest household quintiles. In 1999, the lowest income quintile of households \nhad an annual per capita income of D1.2 million ($78); the highest, D10.4 million ($691). In rural areas, the \ncorresponding figures for the lowest income quintile are D996,000 ($66), and for the highest, D6.3 million ($418). In \n1999, the figures for the lowest income quintile in urban areas was D2.4 million ($160), and for the highest, D23.5 \nmillion ($1,569).2 \n \nPoverty incidence is highest the Northern Uplands, Central Highlands, and Mekong River Delta, and certain groups \nremain vulnerable. Most of the poor (i) are farmers, (ii) are poorly educated, (iii) have many children, (iv) have little \naccess to material resources such as land, and (v) have little access to social and physical infrastructure. Two \ngroups are particularly vulnerable: ethnic minorities and unregistered migrants in urban areas. \n \nThe Government\u2019s achievements in reducing poverty are momentous. Urban poverty dropped from 25% in 1993 to \n9% in 1998, and rural poverty, from 66% to 45%. Poverty largely affects the rural population and ethnic minorities. \nApproximately 90% of poor live in rural areas, where the incidence poverty is 45% compared with 10\u201315% in urban \nareas. Although poverty incidence has declined significantly, one third of the country\u2019s population remains poor. The \nincreased private costs (tuition fees, uniforms, etc.) of education have reduced enrollment, particularly among the \npoor. Ethnic minorities make up 28.5% of the poor but only 14.2% of the population. Despite the Government\u2019s high \npriority on poverty reduction and support for ethnic minorities, they are underrepresented in upper secondary \neducation, especially the poor and females. Low income and consumption, and poor health bar these groups from \nupper secondary education.  \n \nPoor households lack access to productive farming land and adequate infrastructure and education  services. Ethnic  \nminority  households, and  settlers who previously engaged in swidden agriculture then moved to urban areas are \noften  excluded  from  mainstream  economic  activity.  Physical  and  social  exclusion  usually  results  in  a \ntransgenerational poverty cycle of poor living conditions, low productivity, and low income, limiting access to \neducation. \n                     \n1  Statistical Publishing House. 2001.

Targeting poor beneficiaries, especially females from ethnic minorities and others from \ndisadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, the Project will reduce poverty in the 20 disadvantaged provinces \nthrough (i) provision of special study support programs, (ii) provision of institutional materials and teaching aids to \npoor students, and (iii) development of facilities such as new schools/classrooms closer to the homes of poor \nstudents. These measures will increase access and participation, and retention and completion rates among \ndisadvantaged students. \n \nThe Project is national in scope but will focus its investment in 20 disadvantaged provinces with (i) the lowest NER, \n(ii) low gross enrollment rate (GER) and female GER, (iii) a large number of very poor communes and/or low human \ndevelopment index rating, (iv) a high number of ethnic minority people, and (v) a high completion rate in lower \nsecondary education but low transition rate to upper secondary.

Access, equity, and participation in upper secondary education has improved markedly over \nthe past decade, with increasing enrollment among females and ethnic minorities. However, wide \ndisparities still remain in and between provinces. The poor have much more limited access to \neducation  at  all  levels  than  do  higher-income  groups.  Many  more  ethnic  minority  children, \nespecially girls, continue to face obstacles to attending school. \n \n2.  The  Government  has  actively  supported  and  invested  in  services  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable.  However,  certain  ethnic  minorities  face  many  specific  disadvantages,  which  are \nhighlighted by physical and cultural isolation. Gender inequality is also serious, especially among \npoor, rural, and ethnic minority households. Despite government initiatives, discriminatory practices \nand traditions undermine the rights and needs of ethnic minority girls and women. Curriculum and \nfacility development targeting ethnic minority children will be prioritized. The following action plan \nidentifies the approach and target group that the Project will focus on to address the needs of \nfemale and ethnic minority students. \n \nTable A14.1: Action Plan for Gender and Ethnic Minority Needs \n \nComponent/Activity  Approach and Target \nComponent 1: Supporting Conditions for   \nQuality Improvement in Upper Secondary   \nEducation   \n   \nCurriculum development  Curriculum development specialists will be trained in gender \nand ethnic minority issues and diversity.  The new diversified \ncurriculum will be sensitive to gender and ethnic minority issues \n(social, cultural, and economic diversity).  \n \nOptional topics relevant to gender and ethnic minority issues, \npreservation of indigenous knowledge, and economic \ndevelopment of ethnic minority areas will be included. \n   \nTeaching methods for the diversified curriculum will be \nTeaching methods  \nsensitive to gender, and ethnic and cultural diversity. \n \n   \nIn-service teacher training will include topics on gender issues, \nIn-service teacher training \nethnic and cultural diversity, indigenous language instruction, \nand learning styles of girls and diverse ethnic minority groups.  \n \nMaster trainers will conduct in-service training for delivery of \nsummer school programs.  New teachers will be trained and \nassigned to teach in special programs.  Skills of teachers in \npoor areas will be upgraded. \n \nIn selecting participants for in-service teacher training, priority \nwill be given to women to achieve at least the same proportion \nof women's participation as in the overall pool of the in-service \ntrainees.  \n \nThrough student-centered learning approaches, the learning \nneeds of female and ethnic minority students will be included in \nin-service teacher training. \n \n   \nImproved instructional materials will be provided to upper \nInstructional materials \nsecondary schools that serve the poor populations, including \nethnic minority groups under component 2. \n ", "56      Appendix 14 \nComponent 2: Improving Access, Equity, and   \nParticipation in Upper Secondary Education in   \nDisadvantaged Areas   \n   \nConstruction, replacement, or upgrading of upper  This subcomponent will cover the 20 disadvantaged provinces. \nsecondary school facilities, including classrooms  Efforts will be made to locate schools as close to ethnic \n  minority communities as possible and to include amenities to \n  attract girls.  Decisions on school locations will be based on \nschool mapping and targeting. \n \n   \nSupport study programs for targeting poor, ethnic minority, and \nSupport study programs \nfemale students will be initiated and implemented in the 20 \ndisadvantaged provinces.  The programs will be conducted at a \nschool or through qualified teachers who reside in remote \nareas.  Support study program delivery will be sensitive to local \nneeds such as remote location.  Materials designed to enhance \nacademic skills and knowledge of gender, and culture and \nethnic diversity will be used. \n \n   \nAn IEC program will be developed and campaigns conducted in \nInformation, education and communication (IEC) \ntarget communities, especially among ethnic minority groups to \ndevelopment \nconvince parents of the benefits of educating children, \nparticularly girls. Information will be disseminated in \nethnographically focused and culturally sensitive ways and \nmeans. \n   \nComponent 3: Strengthening Management of   \nUpper Secondary Education   \n   \nPilot initiatives  Pilot initiatives will be completed in eight provinces: \n(i) decentralized financing of schools, (ii) improving community-\nschool partnerships, (iii) administrative roles and \nresponsibilities in a decentralized environment, (iv) managing \neducation in difficult areas, and (v) socializing of upper \nsecondary education.  \n \nLessons learned will be fed back into the education system to \nincrease access and participation in upper secondary schools, \nespecially among the poor, ethnic minorities, and girls. Training \nof education managers at provincial, district, school, and \ncommune level, including members of parents\u2019 associations, \nwill raise awareness of gender and ethnic minority issues. \n \n   \nStudent-based education management  Student-based EMIS strategies will be strengthened so that \ninformation system (EMIS)  disaggregated data tracking and analyses can be carried out.  \nThis activity will be of special benefit to the underserved ethnic \nminority and female students on whom there is little available \ndata. \n \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Organization  \n \n3.  The  Project\u2019s  gender  and  ethnic  minorities  action  plan  is  infused  across  all  three \ncomponents.  Overall  implementation  responsibilities  will  lie  with  relevant  departments  of  the \nMinistry of Education and Training (MOET) and the National Project Implementation Unit (NPIU) at \nthe  central  level,  and  provincial  project  implementation  units  (PPIUs)  at  the  provincial  level.  \nSpecific responsibilities for particular aspects and activities of the action plan are included in the \nterms  of  reference  for  individual  consultants  to  ensure  that  intended  goals  are  achieved. ", "                      Appendix 14   57 \nNongovernment organizations will be consulted to develop innovative approaches to reach ethnic \nminority female students in remote areas.   \n \n2.  Institutional Capacity \n \n4.  MOET  has  one  research  center,  the  Research  Center  for  Ethnic  Minority  Education, \nresponsible for gathering information on education of ethnic minority groups, developing curriculum \nand  teaching  methods,  and  contributing  to  policy  studies.    The  Department  of  Continuing \nEducation also does similar work, but targets ethnic minorities and adult learners. The action plan \nwill seek to involve the center staff, although primary responsibility for activities will be spread \nthroughout MOET departments, NPIU, PPIUs, and consultants. The Project will build upon ongoing \nactivities under the Lower Secondary Education Development Project and the Teacher Training \nProject, targeting ethnic minorities, especially females, in school construction and replacement \nprograms; curriculum renovation adopting more active, student-centered learning approaches; and \nrelated in-service teacher training.    \n \n3.  Budget and Financing Plan   \n \n5.  The action plan does not require separate budgets since it is integrated into the overall \nproject cost. The benefits of component 1 will spread nationwide at different levels; estimating how \nmuch will accrue to ethnic minorities and female students is difficult.  Civil works under component \n2 in the 20 disadvantaged provinces will increase access in remote and ethnic minority areas. The \nProject  will  also  have  specialist  assistance  through  social  development,  ethnic  minority,  and \ngender specialist (6 person-months) who will help implement the action plan.   \n \n4.  Implementation Schedule \n \n6.  The action plan\u2019s implementation schedule will be in line with the overall implementation of \nthe Project for 6 years, from early 2003 to mid-2009, and specific implementation schedule of each \nof three project components.  \n \n5.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n7.  The monitoring and evaluation of the action plan will be incorporated into the overall \nmonitoring and evaluation plan developed for all three project components.  Monitoring will be \nongoing to ensure that activities are effectively carried out and targets reached. Monitoring will also \nallow for adjustments of the action plan during implementation.  The NPIU will be responsible for \nestablishing and coordinating monitoring and evaluation activities, and PPIUs will monitor local \nschool-based and community activities.  The midterm review will also be accompanied by staff with \nexpertise in gender and ethnic minority issues. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021129143545Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20030203100707+08'00'"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2002) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  dong (D) \n \nD1.00  =  $0.00007 \n$1.00  =  D15,369.5 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  BOET  \u2013  bureau of education and training \n  DOET  \u2013  provincial department of education and training \n  EFA  \u2013  education for all \n  EMIS  \u2013  education management information system \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  GER  \u2013  gross enrollment rate \n  IASC  \u2013  Interagency Steering Committee \n  IEC  \u2013  information, education, and communication \n  JICA  \u2013  Japan International Cooperation Agency \n  MOET  \u2013  Ministry of Education and Training \n  NER  \u2013  net enrollment rate \n  NPIU  \u2013  National Project Implementation Unit \n  PPIU  \u2013  provincial project implementation unit \n  SESMP  \u2013  secondary education sector master plan \n  TTU  \u2013  teacher training university \n  TUSS  \u2013  technical upper secondary school \n \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n     This report was prepared by a team consisting of Y.
