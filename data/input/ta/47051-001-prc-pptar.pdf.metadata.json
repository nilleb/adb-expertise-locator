Justification \n1.  A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) of $700,000 is required to prepare the \nproject. The PPTA will be implemented in two parts. During Part 1 of the PPTA, an innovative \nenergy service company (ESCO) financing structure will be developed in close cooperation \nbetween  the  China  National  Chemical  Corporation  (ChemChina),  China  Haohua  Chemical \nGroup Co., Ltd. (CHC), potential ESCOs, the National Development and Reform Commission \n(NDRC), financial intermediaries, and other stakeholders. Together with the financing structure, \nthe overall ensuing loan implementation arrangements will also  be firmed up. Due to potential \nenvironmental impacts,  an in-depth energy audit and environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nof the subprojects will be conducted in parallel to the development of the financing structure \nduring the part 1 of the PPTA.  \n \n2.  The  part 2 of the PPTA  will (i) conduct technical, economic and financial due diligence \nof subprojects; (ii) strengthen the implementing agency in Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) \nguidelines on procurement and loan disbursement; and (iii) carry out necessary assessments of \nthe executing and implementing agencies, including financial management and procurement \ncapacity  assessments.  Further  analysis  and  consulting  services  requirements  will  be \ndetermined at the end of the PPTA\u2019s part 1.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n3.
