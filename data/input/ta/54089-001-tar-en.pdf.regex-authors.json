The transaction TA facility will provide project preparation support to a series of ensuing \nprojects, comprising (i) Punjab Provincial Highway Project; (ii) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Rural \nRoad Development Project; and (iii) Sindh Provincial Road Improvement Project (Phase II). All \nensuing projects aim to rehabilitate or upgrade existing provincial roads or rural roads while \nimproving regional connectivity with neighboring provinces. Project identification and preliminary \ntechnical reviews are being carried out with either ongoing loan proceeds or the provincial \ngovernment\u2019s own resources. The government has cleared the concept papers for these ensuing \nprojects in the fourth quarter of 2019. The TA facility is required to conduct the relevant due \ndiligence, improve project readiness, provide implementation support during the initial stage, and \nprovide capacity building activities for the concerned executing and implementing agencies. The \nTA facility is listed in the 2019 pipeline in the approved Country Operations Business Plan (2019\u2013\n2021)1 for Pakistan. The ensuing projects are included in the Country Operations Business Plan \n(2020\u20132022) for Pakistan.2 \n \n2.  Road network in the country. Transport is a key driver of socioeconomic development. \nTransport allows people to access jobs, markets, social interaction, education, and other services, \nenabling people to rise out of poverty and overcome social exclusion. Transport adds value to \ngoods brought to markets, and links rural areas to cities and global supply chains, thereby driving \neconomic development.3 Road transport dominates Pakistan's transport system, accounting for \nalmost 98% of freight traffic in ton-kilometers and 94% of passenger traffic in passenger-\nkilometers. Pakistan\u2019s road network of 263,000 kilometers (km) consists of 12,500 km of national \nhighways and 93,000 km of provincial highways, with the remainder classified as either district, \nrural roads, or urban roads. The national highway network, which is less than 5% of the total road \nnetwork, caters to 80% of inter-urban traffic. The National Highway Authority (NHA) is responsible \nfor national highways, while the provincial governments are responsible for provincial highways, \nand district roads. Other rural roads come under the jurisdiction of local government bodies as \nwell as other government agencies (such as provincial irrigation departments). Urban roads and \nstreets are the responsibility of municipalities, cantonment boards, metropolitan/city development \nauthorities and housing development agencies.  \n \n3.  Needs for improved connectivity. Despite the high reliance on road transport, the quality \nand capacity of the road infrastructure severely constrains free and safe traffic flow. While the \nquality of the national highways has improved considerably from continuous capital spending such \nas China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Program and better road asset management, the \noverall condition remains below the target to eliminate those roads with condition of poor and very \npoor\u2014only 11% of national highways are assessed to be in good and 67% in fair condition.4 This \nis partly due to aging road and bridge infrastructure. The condition of the provincial highways is \nworse, especially in the remote parts of the country. They have poor serviceability (narrow, rough \nand unsafe) and many are either perennially impassable due to flooding/landslides, or subject to \nclosure due to extreme weather events. The district and rural access roads, which connect \nfarmers to market, likewise have poor serviceability and receive even less attention (mostly \nemergency repairs) due to lacking ownership and inadequate funding.  \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

The government\u2019s vision for 20255 \nincludes transport and connectivity as one of the seven priorities to achieve high, sustained, and \ninclusive growth. The previous government\u2019s plan for the transport sector envisaged rehabilitation \nand upgrading of the existing network, selective investment in new highways to facilitate regional \ntrade, enhanced private sector participation, and control of overloading. Following  completion of  \nseveral mega road projects under CPEC, the government has shifted its focus to improvement of \nregional connectivity, especially linkages to remote and/or underdeveloped areas, reforming the \nrailway  network,  and  improving  transport  logistics,  particularly  removal  of  bottlenecks  to \ninternational (cross-border) trade, domestic commerce, and tourism (footnote 3).  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s involvement in the transport sector. ADB has been a leading development \npartner in Pakistan\u2019s transport sector. Since 2010, ADB has focused on the upgrading of existing \nnational highway network as well as construction of new motorways totaling 480 kms, including \ninvesting in improving border crossing under the Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Program. Before 2009, ADB\u2019s assistance included interventions in each province, \ncovering improvements on national and provincial highways, as well as rural roads in one \numbrella project. However, each project involved more than one executing agency which resulted \nin difficulties in implementation. Some projects faced difficulties during implementation due to \nstart-up delays in projects in Sindh and KP provinces. Some lessons will be further addressed in \nthe proposed TA facility and ensuing projects. \n \n6.  Road development in Punjab. The province of Punjab is situated at the crossroads of \nnational and international growth corridors with the potential to connect with regional economies. \nThe area mostly consists of an alluvial plain that has served as the region\u2019s food basket for \ncenturies. It is also Pakistan\u2019s most industrialized province, and accounts for almost 40% of large-\nscale manufacturing and 70% of small-scale manufacturing, mostly located in north\u2013eastern \nPunjab. The classified road network of 86,098 km in Punjab includes 3,276 km of national \nhighways and 1,422 km of motorways managed by the NHA, 10,415 km of provincial highways, \nand 70,985 km of district roads managed by the Punjab Communication and Works Department \n(C&WD). \n \n7.  There is a significant geographical disparity in the development of Punjab\u2019s economy, with \nthe southern and western districts of the province (more rural, agricultural) lagging substantially \nbehind the relatively more prosperous northern and eastern districts (more urban, industrial). The \ninadequacy of east-west road connectivity becomes most apparent in southern Punjab given the \nnorth-south orientation of the three high-capacity national  road  transport corridors (M4, M3 and \nN5) while there are no direct east-west corridors linking the market towns of southern Punjab (e.g. \nbetween Layyah and Okara; Rajanpur and Bahawalnagar; and other areas).  \n \n8.  The Punjab government is developing a provincial spatial strategy that has identified key \neast-west routes to provide strong potential for economic growth with forward linkages to various \ndevelopment initiatives under CAREC and CPEC programs. The key provincial road transport \ncorridors that the government plans to develop by 2023 are included in Punjab Growth Strategy \n2023, which was launched in May 2019. These corridors include about 244 roads (classified as \narterials) with an aggregate length of more than 11,000 km. The traffic volume exceeds 8,000 \nvehicles per day on about 60 out of 244 roads, but only 45 roads have been dualized. Increasing \ntraffic growth (at a rate of 6\u20138% per annum) combined with a traffic mix of motorcycles, rickshaws, \ntractors, and heavy-laden trucks, buses, and cars causes acute traffic congestion and significant \n \n5  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms. 2014.

Many fatal and serious injury traffic accidents have been \nreported as a result of head on collisions.  \n \n9.  Road development in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Road transport is the mainstay of transport \nactivity in KP. In addition, KP provides the main transit corridor to Afghanistan across the Khyber \nPass. The province has a classified paved road network of 15,102 km, of which 1,878 km are \nnational  highways managed  by  NHA,  2,204 km  are  provincial  highways6 managed  by the \nPakhtunkhwa Highways Authority (PKHA), and 11,400 km are district roads managed by the KP \nC&WD. Provincial highways, with an average daily traffic ranging from 3000-8000 vehicles, \nconnect district centers with the national highway network, and play a vital role in economic \ndevelopment of the province. District roads and rural access roads which directly connect farmers \nto market and other social service providers, have been neglected for quite a long time, due to \nlack of financial resources, the very large rehabilitation needs (maintenance backlog), relatively \nlow traffic volumes, the rugged mountainous terrain, and until recently, conflict and insecurity \naffecting large parts of KP.  \n \n10.  As in Punjab, there is also a significant disparity in road connectivity in rural areas of KP \nwith southern and western KP having significantly lower road density (especially all-weather, \npaved roads) as compared to central and eastern KP. The newly merged tribal districts (formerly \nFederally Administered Tribal Areas) are the least endowed with roads. A key development \npriority of the KP government is to rectify the disparity in road connectivity across the province \nwith greater attention to the southern and western districts. Other road sector priorities include \nupgrading of the provincial road network (managed by PKHA), improved and reliable access to \ntourism centers, and rehabilitation and upgrading of rural roads to improve access to markets and \nsocial services.  \n \n11.  Road development in Sindh. More than 60% of Sindh\u2019s population live in rural areas, \nwhere  agriculture  is  the  main  source  of  livelihood.  Sindh\u2019s  economic  development  is  also \nunbalanced geographically. Karachi, the provincial capital and Pakistan\u2019s largest city, accounts \nfor about 20% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, 75% of national trade, and more than 30% \nof value added in large-scale manufacturing. Rural Sindh, especially the poorly connected \nsoutheast and north parts of the province, lags in both economic and social development with a \npoverty headcount double that of urban areas. The lack of reliable, all-weather roads has \nsignificantly contributed to economic and social deprivation in rural areas.  \n \n12.  Transport activity in Sindh largely relies on road transport. The classified paved road \nnetwork of 25,737 km in Sindh includes 1,365 km of national highways, 2,830 km of provincial \nhighways, 11,630 km of secondary roads, and 9,912 km of access roads. Much of the road \nnetwork is spread densely along the banks of the Indus River and its major irrigation and drainage \ncanals. Rural road connectivity is poor in the southeastern and north districts of the province and \nalong the coast. Sindh\u2019s provincial highways, which handle traffic with a range of 3,000\u20138,000 \nvehicles daily, connect provincial administrative and commercial centers with district headquarters \nand market towns. They are vital in facilitating intra-provincial trade and commerce; providing \naccess to health, education, and other public services; and reducing poverty by creating jobs and \nbusiness opportunities. The condition of the provincial highway system is, however, below \nnational standard, and the pavement surface condition and riding quality are deteriorating. Many \nof these roads have been upgraded to rural roads or tracks with low bearing capacity to sustain \nheavier traffic loads and resist damage from storm surges and flooding. Most provincial highways \nhave substandard geometric standards. The pavement condition of more than half of the road \n \n6  Including 380 km of provincial highways located in federally administered tribal areas. \n ", "4   \nnetwork is rated poor or bad. Inadequate expenditure on road maintenance and an inability to \nproperly prioritize expenditures have accelerated road deterioration, resulting in an increase in \ntraffic accidents, vehicle operating costs, and travel times. Key road development objectives \ninclude upgrading all provincial highways to proper design standards with a focus on safety and \nclimate resilience, adding critical missing road links to the network in the under-served parts of \nthe province, and sustainable preservation and maintenance of the secondary and rural access \nroads. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Transport sector project feasibility study and preparation supported. The \nTA facility will provide technical expertise to prioritize, plan, and prepare road investment projects \nunder the proposed (i) Punjab Provincial Highway Project; (ii) KP Rural Road Development \nProject; and (iii) Sindh Provincial Road Improvement Project (Phase II). This will include all \nrequisite due diligence; assessment of technical suitability; and the economic, financial, and social \nviability of the proposed projects. The TA facility will also address capacity and institutional \nconstraints, environmental and social safeguards, and gender concerns, and identify measures \nto strengthen project implementation and policy related issues. \n \n14.  Output 2: Project management capacity of the executing agencies improved. The \nTA facility will strengthen the capacity of the executing agencies in project management through \nimproved project readiness, procurement and contract management. The TA facility will also aim \nto (i) improve road safety and road maintenance sustainability, including gender mainstreaming \nfor design and implementation; (ii) promote climate risk adaptation and mitigation measures; (iii) \nexplore the private sector\u2019s participation in road investment; and (iv) introduce a new technology \nin the transport sector in the provinces.  \n \n15.  The TA facility is considered complex, because the loan amount for an ensuing project \nmay  exceed  $200 million.  ADB  has  experience  with  each  of  the  executing  agencies,  and \nsafeguards classifications for the ensuing projects would likely be B. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,600,000.00, of which $1,500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n17.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA activities for ensuing projects will start only after ADB approves the project concept \npaper for each of the ensuing projects. \n \n19.  ADB will administer the TA facility and be responsible for TA implementation oversight, \naccountability for the outputs, and communication with the consultants and stakeholders. The \ngovernments of Punjab, KP, and Sindh will be the executing agencies for each ensuing project, \nrespectively. A steering committee, to be chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary, will be \n ", "5 \nestablished for each province to oversee and monitor project preparatory activities under the TA \nfacility.  \n \n20.
