Regional cooperation and integration is one of three institutional objectives of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) corporate guidance in Strategy 2020, which recognizes health security \nfrom the control of communicable diseases as a regional public good.1 The Operational Plan for \nHealth  and  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Strategy  also  highlight  ADB\u2019s  role  in \nsupporting  Asia  and  the  Pacific  to  expand  opportunities  for  addressing  health  challenges  at \nregional and subregional levels.2  \n \n2.  The region continues to face communicable disease challenges, including a continuing \nburden from malaria, particularly in border areas.3 Malaria control and elimination remain relevant \nto  the  health  agenda,  even  as  many  countries  have  made  strong  progress  in  meeting  the \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) target on malaria (6c) of reducing by 75% the incidence of \nmalaria by 2015. After 2015, countries in the region are targeting further reductions, with some \ncountries declaring malaria elimination goals within the next 10\u201315 years.  \n \n3.  However, sustained progress in reducing malaria will depend on better regional cooperation \nto  prevent  cross-border  transmission;  sustained  attention  from  national  health  authorities; \nmaintaining financing, even as malaria garners less global and national concern as a result of \nlower incidence; and containing growing artemisinin resistance (drug-resistant) malaria, particularly \nin the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). High-level engagement within and beyond the health \nsector is needed if malaria control and elimination are to be achieved. \n \n4.  This regional technical assistance (TA) will support regional leadership and cooperation on \nmalaria control and elimination, including containment of drug-resistant malaria, and pave the way \nfor  strengthened  regional  cooperation  on  long-term  control  and  prevention  of  communicable \ndiseases.4 It will help build stronger collaboration between governments, the private sector, and \nother stakeholders, to improve regional leadership, financing, and drug management for malaria.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Asia and the Pacific has made significant progress in combating malaria\u2014reducing malaria \ndeaths by more than 25% since 2000.5 Despite this, malaria remains a major cause of death and \nillness, with an estimated 30 million cases and around 42,000 deaths in the region each year. This \nhigh rate of illness and loss of human life affects economic development and is both unacceptable \nand preventable.  \n \n6.  In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant malaria in parts of the GMS is a threat to \nregional and global health. While much progress has been made in reducing malaria, the rise of \ndrug resistance in the GMS threatens progress made to date, not only in Asia, but in other regions \nof the world. The previous history of drug resistance saw resistance that developed in the GMS \nspread  throughout  Asia  and  transfer  rapidly  to  Africa  through  trade  and  labor  migration, \noverwhelming fragile malaria control programs. As new drugs entered the market rapidly, the \n                                            \n1 ADB. 2008.

World Malaria Report. Geneva. ", "2     \n \ndisease  was  again  beaten  back.  However,  no  viable  new  drugs  are in  the  antimalarial  drug \ndevelopment pipeline, so the situation is considered grave.  \n \n7.  Malaria, including drug-resistant malaria, does not recognize national borders.6 A regional \napproach is needed to address the causes and spread of malaria and drug-resistant malaria, which \nis linked to increased human mobility, migration, trade, logging, and illegal trade of counterfeit \ndrugs. Urgent coordinated, multi-country action is needed to keep countries on course. Failure to \ndo so will result in reversing malaria trends, at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives and \nbillions of dollars.  \n \n8.  In this context, representatives of governments and partners from Asia and the Pacific and \nbeyond met in Sydney, Australia, for the Malaria 2012 conference from 31 October to 2 November \n2012, to accelerate progress on malaria control and elimination and to accelerate containment of \ndrug resistance. The leaders attending the meeting agreed to (i) accelerate progress toward the \ngoal set by member states of the World Health Assembly of a 75% reduction in malaria cases and \ndeaths by 2015, thus contributing to the United Nations Secretary General\u2019s goal of near-zero \ndeaths from malaria worldwide; and (ii) support urgent collective action to contain drug-resistant \nmalaria. To do this, it was agreed to establish the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance (APLMA). \nThe subsequent agreement of East Asia Summit (EAS) leaders on 20 November 2012 to the \nAustralian-proposed  declaration  on  Regional  Responses  to  Malaria  Control  and  Addressing \nResistance to Antimalarial Medicines gave further political leadership and support to this issue. 7  \n \n9.  The APLMA is a regional initiative led by Australia and Viet Nam. ADB was asked to \nprovide  secretariat  functions  for  the  APLMA  because  of  its  strength  in  regional  cooperation, \nmultisectoral  collaboration,  donor  harmonization,  and  innovative  partnerships.  The  APLMA, \nincluding  co-chairing  arrangements,  the  secretariat,  and  the  task  forces,  will  have  an  initial \nmandate through the end of 2015, to coincide with the ending of the timeline for meeting the MDG \ntargets. The objectives of the APLMA are to (i) undertake high level policy advocacy with decision \nmakers in Asia and the Pacific, to drive progress and accountability to achieve the goals of 75% \nreduction in malaria cases and deaths by 2015; (ii) contribute to the worldwide target of near-zero \ndeaths and to the long-term aspiration of Asian and Pacific countries to achieve malaria elimination; \n(iii) mobilize urgent country and regional action to address emerging public health issues, in the \nfirst  instance  addressing  antimalarial  drug  resistance;  and (iv) track  progress  by  working  with \nexisting regional institutions, such as the WHO; Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; \nRoll Back Malaria Initiative; and the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be reduced incidence of malaria in the GMS and other selected \nhigh-malaria incidence developing member countries8. The outcome will be increased financing, \n                                            \n6  Malaria is preventable and curable, and the best treatment is artemisinin-based combination therapy (antimalarial \ndrugs). No alternative antimalarial medicines currently exist that offers the same level of efficacy. In recent years, \nresistance to this antimalarial medicine has been detected in the GMS reigon. Continued efficacy of this first line \ntreatment is critical for ensuring that gains made are not reversed and for the eventual elimination of malaria. \n7  Participating  countries in the  7th  EAS are  Australia,  Brunei,  Cambodia,  India,  Indonesia,  Japan,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, People\u2019s Republic of China, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, \nSouth Korea, Thailand, United States, and Viet Nam. \n8  Countries  include:  Afghanistan,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  East  Timor,  India,  Indonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, People\u2019s Republic of China, Philippines, \nSolomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam \n \n ", "3 \n \nsupport, and quality drugs and technologies for malaria and other communicable diseases in the \nregion. This TA will support capacity building of the APLMA, and will establish and oversee the \nsecretariat and two task forces. One task force will help APLMA develop policy recommendations \non improving access to quality medicines and other technologies, including increasing regional \nproduction capacity for and access to medicines. The other task force will examine options and \ndevelop policy recommendations for the APLMA for sustainable financing mechanisms for malaria \nprograms as the region moves from disease control to elimination. It is envisaged that the APLMA \nplatform will provide an entry point to develop a regional architecture to respond effectively to other \nregional  health  threats,  particularly  communicable  diseases.  The  TA  will  also  ensure  strong \nlinkages between the APLMA and ADB\u2019s regional financing mechanism for health, which will allow \nADB to respond to health sector needs expressed by leaders convened through the APLMA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will deliver three outputs: (i) APLMA secretariat in place supporting regional leaders \nto deliver on national malaria targets; (ii) selected member countries implement APLMA policy \nrecommendations to improve financing of malaria control programs; and (iii) selected member \ncountries  implement  APLMA  policy  recommendations  on  improving  access  to  quality  malaria \nmedicines. \n \n12.  Output  1:  Asia-Pacific  Leaders  Malaria  Alliance  Secretariat  supporting  regional \nleaders to deliver on national malaria targets. The APLMA consists of leaders from select EAS \nnations and malaria-affected countries in Asia and the Pacific. The initial mandate for the APLMA \nis through to the end of 2015. In mid-2015, a review will be undertaken to inform decisions about \nthe ongoing need for and structure of the APLMA, including expansion to other communicable \ndiseases. The Secretariat will support the APLMA in developing the capacities needed to improve \nmalaria programs in Asia and the Pacific. This will include support for organizational development \nof the APLMA, developing work plans, convening of task forces, coordinating review of task force \nrecommendations, reporting on progress and engaging new members.   \n \n13.  The APLMA Secretariat will (i) convene a regional task force to explore options and make \npolicy recommendations to close the financing gap; (ii) convene a regional task force to develop \npolicy recommendations to improve access to quality antimalarial medicines and technologies in \nAsia and the Pacific; (iii) help APLMA to expand the coverage of effective malaria interventions, in \npartnership  with  nongovernment  organizations  and  the  private  sector;  and  (iv)  identify  and \ncoordinate priority research and development.9 The APLMA secretariat will support the APLMA to \nwork toward its objectives and achieve its envisaged results.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Policy recommendations implemented by the majority of APLMA members \nfor sustained financing of malaria control and elimination. A regional task force on innovative \nfinance with two co-chairs will be established to assess the baseline and gap in domestic and \nregional financing and to identify options and make policy recommendations for raising sustainable \nadditional financing for malaria. The task force will need to (i) identify financial  shortfalls and \ncommodity gaps to meet the agreed malaria targets; and (ii) develop a strategic plan to address \nthese gaps, with options and recommendations for raising and sustaining finance. This will include \nassessment of options for a regional financing mechanism based on voluntary contributions. The \n                                            \n \n9  The WHO estimates the financing gap between available domestic and external resources needed to provide full \nmalaria prevention and treatment services to those in need, for the GMS alone, to be nearly $400 million through 2015. \n \n ", "4     \n \ntask force will build on lessons learned on global health financing, and work through existing \ninstitutional and programmatic arrangements to avoid duplication of effort, and where possible, \naccelerate  progress.  It  will  collaborate  closely  with  existing  regional  institutions  and  policy \nprocesses, in particular the ASEAN secretariat, EAS, Secretariat of the Pacific Community, and the \nPacific Islands Forum. \n \n15.  The  task  force  will  be  composed  of  a  number  of  experts  convened  by  the  APLMA \nsecretariat  (through  the  team  leader),  representing  government,  regional  bodies,  multilateral \nagencies, the private sector, and donors in Asia and the Pacific. The Task Force will build on the \nfindings and outcomes of this work to make policy recommendations to the APLMA. Findings will \nalso feed into country and regional political fora including ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum, \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community, and EAS. Limited technical assistance is available through \nthe TA to support policy implementation at the national level. \n \n16.  Output 3: Policy recommendations implemented by majority of APLMA members on \nimproving  access  to  quality  malaria  medicines  and  other  technologies.  A task force on \naccess to malaria medicines with two co-chairs will be established to develop and implement a \nstrategy for improving the licensing, trade, and availability of effective antimalarial drugs and other \nnecessary technologies in the region. \n \n17.  Building  on  existing  information regarding  issues  of availability,  quality,  and  access to \nmalaria control drugs and technologies, and on information regarding drivers of drug-resistant \nmalaria, the task force will develop policy recommendations for the APLMA to improve access to \nand  reduce  the  development  of  new  resistance  to  malaria  drugs.  This  will  include  policy \nrecommendations on (i) improved licensing and quality control in the production of antimalarial \ndrugs;  (ii)  improved  malaria  treatment  standards  across  the  region,  recognizing  the  growing \npotential for drug resistance (e.g., eliminating monotherapies); (iii) enforcement of quality control \nstandards in trade, wholesale and retail, of antimalarial drugs and technologies; and (iv) improving \nthe knowledge and understanding of drug buyers, prescribers, and users regarding therapies and \nuser behavior to prevent increased resistance.  \n \n18.  The  task  force  will  be  composed  of  a  number  of  experts  convened  by  the  APLMA \nsecretariat  (through  the  team  leader),  representing  government,  regional  bodies,  multilateral \nagencies, and donors in Asia and the Pacific. Each of the five experts will convene a separate \nworking  group  with  three  to  five  experts,  as  needed,  on  specific  topics.  The  policy \nrecommendations of the task force will be provided to the APLMA and will feed into country and \nregional political fora, including meetings of the WHO governing body, Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation,  ASEAN,  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum,  and  EAS.  Limited  technical  assistance  is \navailable through the TA to support policy implementation at the national level. \n \n19.  A key assumption in the success of the TA is the commitment of the Asia and Pacific region \nleaders for long-term regional political leadership and collaboration in controlling and eliminating \nmalaria,  including  drug-resistant  malaria;  and  in  tackling  broader  communicable  diseases.  A \npotential risk to successful implementation of the TA is the timely availability of highly qualified \nsecretariat staff and technical consultants to support the APLMA in achieving results.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Australia and administered by ADB. \n \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The TA will be implemented from October 2013 to December 2015. ADB, through the \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department,  will  be  the  executing  agency.  Individual \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) to support the TA implementation at ADB \nheadquarters. The project requires a total of 45 person-months of international consulting services \nand 32 person-months of national consulting services. This will include the APLMA executive \nsecretary  (international,  5  person-months);  APLMA  deputy  secretary  (international,  15 person-\nmonths);  APLMA  champions  group  team  leader  (international,  5  person-months,  intermittent); \nAPLMA finance task force team leader (international, 10 person-months); APLMA access to quality \nmedicines task force team leader (international, 10 person-months); health specialist (national, 10 \nperson-months);  finance  and  administration  support  officer  (national,  18 person-months);  and \nknowledge  management  officer  (national,  4  person-months).  Terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n  \n22.  The consultants comprising the APLMA secretariat will be based at ADB headquarters or in \nan adjacent rented space. The TA will finance the cost of rented office space. The TA will also \ncover expenses incurred in the conduct of regional meetings and workshops. Disbursement under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment (computers and office equipment) and supplies \nshall be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time \nto time). \n \n23.  A regional steering committee consisting of key stakeholders will be established to provide \nguidance and coordination to the Secretariat. This will include representatives of key government \nconstituencies,  ADB,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  the  WHO,  and \nrepresentatives from the private sector. A network of centers of excellence will also be established \nto provide technical updates and support to the APLMA.10 \n \n24.  The  expected  outputs,  outcome  evaluation,  and  lessons  learned  will  be  disseminated \nthrough the websites of ADB and other development partners, including the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development and the WHO; and through conference and print materials. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Australia for Strengthening Regional Response to Malaria and \nOther Communicable Diseases in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                            \n10 Centers of Excellence include the Schools of Public Health at Harvard University, London University, Mahidol \nUniversity, and the National University of Singapore; the Pasteur Institutes in Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic; and the WHO Malaria Policy Advisory Committee. \n ", "6  Appendix 1  \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselinesa  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nReduced malaria    World Malaria Report  Long-term government \nincidence in the GMS  Malaria burden reduced    commitment to control \nand other selected high- by 75% by 2015 (2000  WHO Malaria Scorecard  or eliminate malaria \nmalaria burden  baseline).
