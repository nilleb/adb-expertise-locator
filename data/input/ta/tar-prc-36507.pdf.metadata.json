During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) confirmed the request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare a project covering water supply and wastewater components in Jilin \nProvince (Map 1), including Changchun, Liaoyuan, and Meheikou cities (Map 2). The ADB Fact-\nFinding Mission visited the PRC in September 2003, and reached an understanding with the Jilin \nprovincial government (JPG) on the TA goals, purpose, outputs, cost estimates, financing plan, \nand implementation arrangements.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s urban population has grown rapidly in line with economic growth during the past \ntwo  decades.  Rapid  economic  growth  and  continuing  urbanization  place  pressure  on  an \noverloaded urban infrastructure and causes a rapid increase in the demand for urban services, and \nintensifies environmental threats from pollution. Most cities\u2019 physical and financial capacity to \nprovide adequate water and wastewater treatment infrastructure is being strained, leading to \ndeteriorating  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents,  degraded  urban  environment,  and  inefficient \neconomic development. Some cities have a critical shortage of water supply, and many others lack \nwater  supply  delivery  capacities  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  The  Government  has \nclassified more than 300 cities as \u201cwater short,\u201d 108 as having serious water problems, and more \nthan 60 as being critically short of water. The need to cut back on groundwater extraction to \nsustainable  levels  due  to  salinity  intrusion  and  ground  subsidence  has  worsened  the  water \nshortage problem. The situation has been exacerbated by the pollution of raw water sources \nthrough the discharge of inadequately treated agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastewater. In \nmost cities, untreated industrial wastewater is the major source of water pollution, posing a risk to \npublic health, particularly by waterborne diseases and severely polluting streams, canals, rivers, \nlakes, and oceans. Municipal wastewater management is still at an early stage, with only 7.5 billion \ncubic meters (m3) (34% of the total discharge) of municipal wastewater estimated to have received \nsecondary  treatment.  The  Government  is  paying  increasing  attention  to  water  resources \nmanagement, wastewater treatment and pollution control, and formulation of investment plans to \naddress water supply shortages and wastewater treatment.   \n \n3.  The Songhua River Basin (SRB) is the third largest in the PRC after the Changjiang and \nYellow river basins. Located in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and in the Autonomous Region of \nInner Mongolia, SRB has a catchment area of 557,000 square kilometers and a population of 62 \nmillion. The Songhua is one of the most polluted of the 47 major rivers, contaminated with organic \nchemicals, heavy metals, and conventional pollutants. Water pollution is a major constraint on \nsustainable  economic  development.  An  ongoing  ADB  cluster  TA2 is helping the Government \nimplement  the transjurisdictional provisions of the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Act. To \nhelp reduce SRB\u2019s pollution, ADB has provided the Songhua River Basin Water Quality and \nPollution Control Management TA3 to strengthen capacity for water quality and pollution control \nmanagement, and help develop an SRB pollution control plan. The plan will oblige compliance \nfrom industrial, domestic, and non-point source polluters through selected programs and priority \ninvestment projects. The TA will help the Government undertake a public information campaign on \nthe health risks of pollution and mobilize public support to clean up SRB. ADB policy dialogue has \nstressed the need to strengthen the Songliao Water Resources Commission to give it greater \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 30 May 2003.  \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Transjurisdiction Environment Management. \nManila. \n3  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution \nControl Management. Manila. ", "2 \nauthority for comprehensive flood management.4 The 2002 Law on the Management of Water \nResources5 introduces the concept of river basin management. The State Environment Protection \nBureau is coordinating SRB pollution reduction and developed the Five-Year Songhua Pollution \nControl Plan,6 which is the first of a series of steps to improve the Songhua\u2019s water quality to \nminimum levels.  \n \n4.  Changchun, the capital of Jilin, has an urban population of 3 million and is in the upper \nreaches of SRB, between Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces in the northeast of the PRC. The \nYitong and Yongchun rivers in Changchun, which flow into the Songhua, are highly polluted due to \ninadequate  treatment  of  wastewater  discharge.  Jilin,  therefore,  has  a  critical  role  to  play  in \nwastewater management upstream of SRB. The Yitong and Yongchun do not  meet class V of \nnational  water  quality  standards,7  severely  pollute  the  Songhua,  and  threaten  urban  and \ndownstream public health. The Government recognizes that adequate environmental protection \nand  pollution  controls  are  required  for  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  Changchun  sewer \nnetwork and wastewater treatment capacity must be expanded to improve water quality of the \nYitong and Yongchun. State guidelines require that major cities have a wastewater treatment rate \nof 70% by 2010.8 The project will help significantly reduce discharge of untreated wastewater \nupstream of SRB and help the Changchun municipal government (CMG) achieve its goal of 70% \nwastewater treatment rate by 2010. \n \n5.  The  project  rationale  is  consistent  with  the  ADB  water  policy  to  foster  integrated \nmanagement of water resources from a river basin perspective. The Government has proposed \nthree wastewater treatment subprojects with sewers and interceptors in Changchun, and one water \nsupply subproject each in the Shuangyuang district  and Liaoyuan and Meihekou cities. CMG\u2019s \noverall wastewater treatment plans include (i) expansion of the capacity of the Beijiao Wastewater \nTreatment Plant (WWTP) to 390,000 (m3/day); (ii) construction of the Yanming Lake WWTP with a \ncapacity of 100,000  m3/day, and of a WWTP in south Changchun with a capacity of 150,000 \nm3/day (including 50,000 m3/day tertiary treatment to recycle treated wastewater), and a WWTP in \nthe east with a capacity of 100,000 m3/day; and (iii) 183 kilometers (km) of sewer mains and six \npumping stations in north and south Changchun.  \n  \n6.  Shuangyuang, which is 46 km southeast of Changchun, has an urban population of 85,000. \nShuanyuang sources its drinking water from groundwater, depleting the aquifer beneath the city, \nresulting in land subsidence. To address the water shortage and increased demand through 2010, \nthe water supply subproject will convey class II raw water (39,000 m3/day) from the Shuangyang \nReservoir through two 2.9 km pipelines.  \n \n7.  Liaoyuan, with an urban population of 470,000, is south of Changchun.  Average daily \nurban water demand is 132,000 m3/day, which is met only from April to August with water \nshortages for the rest of the year. Water sources include the Yangmu and Daliang reservoirs, and \nsome enterprise self-supplied groundwater. Because of prolonged drought, the Yangmu Reservoir, \nLiaoyuan\u2019s major source of water, has been running for years under the dead water storage of the \nreservoir. The Daliang Reservoir did not have any water in 2002. Liaoyuan proposed to create a \nnew water source by constructing a regulating barrage and raw water mains on the East Liao River \nto provide approximately 100,000 m3/day raw water to the city.  \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Songhua River Flood Management (Sector) Project. Manila. \n5  Approved by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress on 29 August 2002, and effective 1 October \n2002. \n6  The plan is expected to be approved by the State Council within 2003. \n7  PRC water quality standards range from level I (pristine) to level V (very polluted). Level III is considered the lowest \nsuitable for a municipal raw water source.   \n8  China State Department Notice 2000 (36) requires at least 60% by 2005, and 70% by 2010 for all major cities. ", "    3 \n8.  Meihekou, with a population of 629,000, is southeast of Jilin. The water supply shortfall is \nestimated at 22,663 m3/day. Shallow underground aquifers are the sole source of city water. They \ncontain iron and manganese concentrations that exceed national drinking water standards. The \nproposed water supply component includes developing the Hailong Reservoir9 as a source of \ndrinking water for Meihekou through a 40 km pipeline and a water treatment plant.  \n \n9.  The project will relocate about 2,000 people close to their present homes.10 A detailed \nresettlement plan will be prepared in consultation with the affected people, who will receive \nreplacement land of equal or better quality; full compensation for relocation expenses, including \nhousing; and financial assistance for loss of income opportunities. Particular attention will be paid \nto poverty issues and ensuring that people are at least as well-off after resettlement as before. The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction will be reviewed, the impact of the project on the poor \nassessed, and specific measures proposed to make it pro-poor. As unemployment and poverty are \nlikely to increase in Changchun, Liaoyuan, and Meheikou as a result of the reform of state-owned \nenterprises,  the  TA  will  suggest  ways  to  make  safe  water  affordable  to  the  poor  through \nappropriate tariff design, including lifeline tariffs.11 ADB has helped develop national guidelines for \nwastewater  tariffs12  to  improve  urban  wastewater  management  and  enable  investment  in \nwastewater infrastructure. A progressive tariff structure will be considered when reviewing current \nand proposed water and wastewater tariffs. The conceptual project framework is in Appendix 1. An \ninitial assessment of the project\u2019s social and poverty impact is in Appendix 2.  \n \n10.  The project will also support the Government\u2019s objectives for water and wastewater as set \nout in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). The project will improve living conditions and health \nin Changchun, Liaoyuan, and Meihekou, and have a positive impact on downstream cities in SRB \nsuch as Harbin in Heilongjiang Province. Policy dialogue will be pursued in the following areas: (i) \nimproving cost recovery by strengthening tariff systems and structures for raw and treated water \nand  introducing  wastewater  treatment  charges,  (ii)  wastewater  management,  (iii)  water \nconservation,  (iv)  integrated  water  resource  and  wastewater  management  and  environmental \nissues,  (v)  regulatory  enforcement  and  monitoring,  (vi)  corporate  governance  and  enterprise \nreform, (vii) institutional strengthening, (viii) poverty reduction, and (ix) promotion of private sector \nparticipation. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s PRC Country Strategy and Program (2004-\n2006), which emphasizes (i) addressing urban environmental problems, (ii) reducing poverty and \nimproving the living conditions and standards of urban dwellers, and (iii) reducing bottlenecks that \nincrease transaction and production costs and hamper the growth of urban industry and services. \nSince 1994 ADB has provided loans for nine water supply and wastewater treatment projects in the \nChao  Lake  area,  Dalian,  Fuzhou,  Harbin,  Hebei  Province,  Shanghai,  Wenzhou,  Tianjin,  and \nWuhan. These projects have generally been implemented on schedule and have performed well. \nOperations Evaluation Department has postevaluated the Dalian Water Supply Project.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The objective of the TA is to help JPG prepare a project suitable for ADB financing by \nassessing the technical, environmental, financial, economic, social, and institutional feasibility of a \nproject to (i) increase wastewater treatment capacity and improve the urban environment in \n                                                 \n9  The Hailong Reservoir, constructed in 1959, has been used mainly for irrigation. The water quality standard is class II. \n10  Resettlement affects the wastewater treatment component in Changchun.  \n11 ADB has supported the water supply tariff reform process in the PRC through two completed water tariff studies with \nthe Ministry of Construction: ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Water Supply \nTariff Study. Manila; and ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Water Tariff Study II. \nManila.  \n12  ADB. 2001.

", "4 \nChangchun to help clean up SRB; (ii) address problems linked to drinking water shortages and \nwater  quality  in  Shuangyang,  Liaoyuan,  and  Meihekou;  and  (iii)  promote  the  project  cities\u2019 \nsustainable economic development. The TA will identify institutional capacity-building measures, \nincluding wastewater management and policy reforms, to ensure the long-term sustainability of the \nproject and related facilities. The TA output will be workshops and reports recommending the least-\ncost solution to develop wastewater treatment and water supply facilities in Changchun, Liaoyuan, \nand Meihekou to support the Government\u2019s development master plans and help improve living \nconditions, particularly of the urban poor.      \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  will  (i)  evaluate  the  project  in  the  context  of  long-term  plans  and  alternative \nstrategies for wastewater management and water supply capacity to meet project cities\u2019 increasing \ndemand, (ii) review the technical alternatives proposed in the domestic feasibility studies and \nconfirm that the project components have the least economic cost, (iii) assess the situation and \nproject water demand and wastewater generation in urban drainage areas, (iv) prepare cost \nestimates and procurement packages, (v) evaluate local counterpart fund sources and prepare \nfinancing plans for each subproject, (vi) evaluate water and wastewater tariff levels and promote \ntariff reform and cost recovery, (vii) review and update  the Government\u2019s land acquisition and \nresettlement plan in the context of ADB guidelines, (viii) review and update the environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) and prepare a summary EIA (SEIA), (ix) carry out financial and economic \nanalyses, (x) assess the potential impact on the urban poor and propose poverty reduction options \nto ensure that urban poor families will benefit from the project, (xi) propose enterprise management \nreform  options,  (xii)  evaluate  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation,  (xiii)  prepare  a \ncomprehensive project framework and establish monitoring indicators and an effective monitoring \nmechanism, and (iv) review the information and data on water supply leakage. \n \n13.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  that  need  to  be  considered  for  successful  TA \nimplementation include (i) inadequate counterpart support and performance, (ii) lack of adequate \nand timely provision of data, (iii) delay in submitting required studies, (iv) delay in appointing and \nmobilizing consultants, and (v) inadequate performance by the consultants. Competent consultants \nshould be recruited on time and subjected to regular performance checks. JPG agreed to provide \nadequate counterpart support and provide all data when required and to undertake and update all \nstudies according to a timetable agreed on with ADB. Close coordination among the consultants, \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies,  and  ADB  will  mitigate  the  potential  risks.  The  TA \nconsultants will coordinate their work with the ongoing and planned ADB-financed projects in Jilin \nand Heilongjiang, particularly with respect to cross-border water pollution issues (e.g., SRB clean-\nup), maintenance of water resource infrastructure, quality of construction, and rehabilitation works.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $845,000 equivalent, comprising $491,000 in foreign exchange \ncosts, and $354,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will provide $650,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost, and $159,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government has agreed to \nprovide the balance of local currency cost, equivalent to $195,000 in cash and kind for counterpart \nstaff, office space, furniture, administrative support services, and logistics. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  JPG will be the Executing Agency of the TA. A vice governor will chair the TA steering \ncommittee, with members from the Jilin planning committee; Jilin bureaus of construction, finance, ", "    5 \nenvironment  protection,  water  resources,  and  price  administration;  CMG;  and  Liaoyuan  and \nMeihekou  municipal  governments  to  ensure  that  their  views  are  adequately  considered  and \nnecessary support provided. The TA office is headed by the vice director of the construction bureau \nand will include staff from all the mentioned bureaus to maintain interdepartmental coordination and \nensure consultants\u2019 access to relevant project information and data, and to liaise with ADB on \nmatters  relating  to  TA  implementation.  CMG  and  the  Liaoyuan  and  Meihekou  municipal \ngovernments have established a similar organization structure, chaired by their respective vice \nmayors, to implement the TA. JPG will provide the consultants with a suitably furnished office with \nutilities, telecommunication access, materials, maps, data, and all required project documents. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 5 months, from April to August 2004. Total consultants\u2019 \ninput is estimated at 43 person-months: 16 international and 27 domestic. The consultants will be \nengaged through a firm in accordance with Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants by Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers, based on the quality- and cost-based selection method and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consultants will \nhave  expertise  in  water  and  wastewater  management,  wastewater  treatment,  tariff  analysis, \nfinancial and economic analysis, institutional and regulatory development, social analysis and \npoverty impact assessment, resettlement issues, and environmental matters. The consultants\u2019 \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. ADB\u2019s simplified technical proposal approach will be \nused to select and engage the consultants. TA equipment will be procured by the consultants in \naccordance with Guidelines for Procurement under Asian Development Bank Loans. \n \n17.  The consultants will submit to ADB inception, interim, draft final, and final reports; EIA and \nSEIA reports; and an English translation of the Government\u2019s resettlement plan and its summary. \nThe consultant will translate the executive summary of the interim report and complete draft final \nand final reports into Chinese for review by concerned officials.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Jilin Water Supply and Sewerage \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6 Appendix 1   \nCONCEPTUAL PROJECT FRAMEWORK \nProject Targets and   Monitoring  Risks and \nDesign Summary \nMeasurable Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions \nSector/Area Goals       \n       \nImprove water-related  Yitong and Yongchun rivers\u2019  Water quality monitoring   \nenvironmental and social  water quality restored to   and reporting by the   \nconditions in Changchun,  class III, significantly  Changchun Environmental \nLiaoyuan, and Meheikou  reducing pollution upstream  Protection Bureau (EPB)  \ncities, and in cities  of SRB   \ndownstream of the    Conduct surveys at mid-\nSonghua River Basin  National wastewater  term and at project \n(SRB)    treatment rate requirement of  completion as part of the \n      70% met by 2010 in  project performance \n  Changchun   monitoring system \n     \n  100% of urban residents and  Household surveys to be \n  industries receive good  conducted by the project \n  quality and adequate water  management office \nsupply   \n  Records of the water \nsupply companies \n \n \nPurpose/Objectives       \n       \n1.
