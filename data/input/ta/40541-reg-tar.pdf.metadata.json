The 13th summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \n(SAARC), held in November 2005 in Dhaka, has expanded the avenues for energy sector \nregional cooperation among the South Asian countries. The Dhaka Declaration1 reaffirmed the \nprevious Islamabad Declaration on energy sector dialogue and cooperation among SAARC \nmember states. In view of the improved prospects for energy sector cooperation in South Asia, \nand based on the signed Memorandum of Understanding,2 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand the SAARC Secretariat intensified the discussion for cooperation in the energy sector. \nWhen the SAARC secretary general visited ADB headquarters in late November 2005, ADB \nagreed to provide technical assistance (TA)3 to strengthen energy sector cooperation. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  SAARC was formed in 1985 by the heads of state or governments of Bangladesh, \nBhutan, India,  Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka (i) to promote collaboration and mutual \nassistance in economic, social, cultural, technical, and scientific fields; and (ii) to strengthen \ncooperation among the member states in international forums on matters of common interest. \nThe SAARC Secretariat is located in Kathmandu, Nepal, and eight sector- or theme-specific \nSAARC  centers  are  distributed  in  the  SAARC  member  states.  Technical  committees  and \nworking groups have been established to promote sector-specific cooperation. The 13th SAARC \nsummit approved to establish the SAARC Energy Center (SEC) in Islamabad and the Working \nGroup  on  Energy  was  established  during  the  12th  summit  to  promote  sector-specific \ncooperation issues. \n \n3.  ADB is mandated by its Charter to foster regional cooperation in the Asia and Pacific \nregion and contribute to the acceleration of economic development. ADB has considerable \nexperience  in  promoting  subregional  and  regional  cooperation  initiatives,  including  the  (i) \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS), (ii) Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), \n(iii) South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), and (iv) Subregional Economic \nCooperation  in  South  and  Central  Asia  (SECSCA)  programs.  The  main  lesson  is  that \nsubregional  and  regional  cooperation  initiatives  result  in  (i)  better  allocation  and  use  of \nresources through trade liberalization, (ii) better connectivity and knowledge sharing, and (iii) \ncreation  of  opportunities  for  an  increased  level  of  productive  investments.  Improved \nunderstanding  and  trust  through  cooperation  can  also  contribute  to  peace,  stability  and \nenhanced well being in the region.  \n \n4.  ADB fielded the Fact-Finding Mission in April 2006 and the Mission had discussions with \nthe  SAARC  Secretariat  in  Kathmandu  and  SEC  in  Islamabad.  During  the  Mission,  senior \nofficials at the SAARC Secretariat and SEC and the Mission discussed the possible regional \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  concept,  rationale,  outcome,  output,  scope,  and  implementation \narrangements.  The  SAARC  Secretariat  agreed  in  principle  to  the  scope  of  work  and  the \nimplementation arrangements of the proposed TA and requested ADB to prepare the TA paper. \n \n                                                 \n1 The Dhaka Declaration was signed at the Thirteenth SAARC Summit held on 13 November 2005 in Dhaka, \nBangladesh. \n2  In April 2004, ADB and SAARC signed the Memorandum of Understanding for mutual cooperation in areas where \nSAARC places priority and ADB has comparative strengths. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 September 2006. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  India has the largest power system (126,089 megawatts [MW] installed capacity) among \nall SAARC member states. The other member states and their installed capacities are as \nfollows: Pakistan (19,540 MW), Bangladesh (4,680 MW), Sri Lanka (2,387 MW), Nepal (480 \nMW), Bhutan (468 MW), and Maldives (115 MW). Except in Sri Lanka, percentage of rural \nelectrification is less than 50% in all SAARC member states. Often the vast majority of the rural \npoor and other disadvantaged people and groups are deprived of any form of modern energy \nsource. Power system losses in Bhutan and Maldives4 are about 9\u201311%. System losses in all \nother SAARC member states are much higher. For various reasons, energy is not utilized in the \nmost efficient way in all SAARC member states.  \n \n6.  Most  SAARC  member  states  have  their  own  energy  sector  strategies  and  overall \ndevelopment goals. They also have their plans to meet such goals and the energy requirements \nof  their  countries.  For  example,  India  is  currently  promoting  the  most  ambitious  energy \nexpansion program in its history. With the Government\u2019s mission of \u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d at \nan affordable cost, 100,000 MW of new generation capacity is envisaged by 2012, which \nrepresents an approximate doubling of current generation capacity. Pakistan has an equally \nambitious plan and expects to increase its installed capacity to 162,590 MW by 2030. However, \nall SAARC member states, in particular not only major energy users but also major producers, \nare faced with serious problems of power shortages today. The estimated gap between the \npower supply and demand varies from 15 to 20% at the minimum. Consumers and industries \nsuffer due to planned or unplanned load shedding or power shortages.   \n \n7.  Issues such as increasing power shortages in SAARC member states, escalating fuel \nprices, poor access to a modern form energy in rural areas, technology transfer, and sharing \nexamples of good practice were discussed at various meetings sponsored by SAARC. As a \nremedy,  at  the  recent  Dhaka  Summit,  SAARC  member  countries  agreed  to  establish  the \nSAARC Energy Centre (SEC) in Islamabad to promote the development of energy resources, \nincluding hydropower and energy trade in the region; to develop renewable and alternative \nenergy resources; and to promote energy efficiency and conservation in the region. \n \n8.  Efficient use of energy, including power, gas, and oil, are critical in promoting economic \nand social development. However, the progress of cooperation in the energy sector among \nSAARC member states has so far been limited and slower than cooperation in other sectors. All \nover the world, there are sensitivities over energy security and trade. Nonetheless, opportunities \nare significant for cooperation in the joint development of energy resources in energy-rich \ncountries for export to energy-deficient countries within South Asia and neighboring regions. \nThe  trading  of  energy  between  countries  in  South  Asia  and  between  South  Asia  and \nneighboring regions is expected to create a win-win situation for the countries concerned. The \nproposed technical assistance could assist the governments, the private sector, and other \ndevelopment partners to support harnessing opportunities to promote energy trade and identify \noptions for better use of limited energy resources in the SAARC member states. \n \n                                                 \n4 Only Male.  The rest of the country losses are about 20\u201425%. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  expected  impact  of  the  TA  is  to  create,  together  with  other  interventions,  an \nenabling environment for optimizing the supply of and demand for energy through energy \ncooperation  within  the  region  in all  its  aspects.  It  will promote  better  dialogue  and  higher \ncooperation, and identify mutually beneficial investment options. It will create a sustainable \nframework for developing the capacity of SEC and that of energy sector professionals in the \nregion. The TA will comprise three main components: (i) undertaking the SAARC Regional \nEnergy Trade Study (SRETS), which will look into the potential for or impact of energy trade \namong SAARC member states; (ii) developing the capacity of SEC; and (iii) providing technical \nand logistical support by ADB. \n \n10.  The overall expected outcome of the TA is the identification of the most appropriate \nenergy development and trading opportunities to meet the growing energy demand in SAARC \nmember states. The TA will also improve the viability of such development in the energy sector \nprojects in the region by increasing awareness about appropriate incentives, technologies, and \nenabling environment.  \n \n11.  As  recommended  by  the  SAARC  Working    Group  on  Energy  in  its  draft  terms  of \nreference (Appendix 2), SRETS will cover all possible aspects of energy sources, including \nelectricity,  gas,  oil,  coal,  and  alternative  energy  resources.  More  specifically,  SRETS  will \nexamine or assess (i) options for, benefits from, and constraints on energy trade in the region, \ncovering  demand and supply\u2500both current and projected\u2015for optimal utilization of energy \nresources  for  the  benefit  of  SAARC  member  countries;  (ii)  prevailing  trade  regimes,  the \nregulatory and legal frameworks of the member countries; (iii) international best practices and \ntheir relevance or applicability to the region; (iv) various technological, financial, and commercial \noptions for operationalizing the energy trade projects; and (v) the viability and modalities for \ndeveloping transnational energy lines (electricity, gas, oil, and others) keeping in view the \nbroader concept of the Energy Ring (as stated in the Islamabad Declaration).  \n  \n12.  The SEC capacity-development component will establish a network of energy sector \nprofessionals in the region, allowing them to share knowledge, resources, and experience. This \ncomponent will cover activities including undertaking policy studies, training, skills development; \nsharing examples of best practices, and study tours. It will also provide opportunities pertaining \nto energy development and trade for the SEC to undertake the Energy Dialogue, stakeholder \nconsultation to facilitate various regular activities such as Experts Working Group Meeting. \nStudy tours such as visits to the ASEAN Energy Center in Jakarta by about 25 energy sector \nprofessionals from all SAARC member states would be another activity. This will allow the \nSAARC  energy  professionals  to  learn  lessons  from  the  ASEAN  Energy  Center,  which  is \nconsidered a well-organized institution.  \n \n13.  Networking of SAARC regional energy professionals will have the following benefits: \n(i) effective  sharing  of  information  leading  to  improved  systems  and  processes, \n(ii) harmonization of policies and guidelines and establishment of  examples of best practice and, \n(iii) joint utilization of grant funding for building capacity. The network for the energy sector \nprofessionals will be a platform for sharing experience among the regional professionals and \nbuilding the capacity to undertake regional development projects in the future. The network will \nalso allow discussion and coordination of policy, strategic, and regulatory issues that are of \n ", "4   \nmutual interest and facilitate the exchange of information through activities such as seminars, \ntraining, and workshops. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  In general terms, the TA will build on previous works in the area of energy development \nand trade in close coordination with the SAARC Secretariat, SEC, and SAARC member states \nto ensure that all initiatives are sustainable beyond the TA implementation period. Similar \nactivities  in  the  region  and  organizations  involved  in  such  activities  will  be  consulted  and \ncoordinated to the extent relevant to the TA activities. Key activities will include, among others, \n(i) conducting SRETS, workshops, study tours, and seminars; and (ii) sharing best-practice \nexperiences. A number of consultants, recruited as per ADB guidelines, will work closely with \nthe SAARC Secretariat, SEC, governments, and ADB.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.0 million equivalent. The TA will be entirely \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period beginning in January 2007. ADB \nwill  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  Two  of  the  three  components,  namely,  SRETS  and \ndeveloping SEC capacity, will be implemented by the SAARC Secretariat and/or SEC. The \ntechnical and logistics support component will be undertaken by ADB in close coordination with \nthe SAARC Secretariat. \n \n17.  The two components to be implemented by the SAARC Secretariat will be carried out \nunder the overall guidance and direction of the SAARC Standing Committee comprising foreign \nsecretaries of the SAARC member states. The outline terms of reference for the consulting \nservices are in Appendix 4. The SAARC Secretariat will coordinate and communicate with the \nStanding  Committee,  the  governments  concerned,  and  all  stakeholders  involved  in \nimplementing the TA, and keep in close touch with ADB. The SAARC Secretariat will also \nconsult the SAARC Working Group on Energy and SEC. \n \n18.  The SRETS will be undertaken by a team of consultants selected as an international \nconsulting firm with a team leader who has extensive experience in both energy trade issues \nand the region. The consultants may include national energy experts and international energy \nexperts to be engaged for 24 and 8 person-months, respectively (total of 32 person-months). \n   \n19.  The  SRETS  will  use,  as  inputs,  all  available  information,  studies,  reports  at  ADB, \nSAARC Secretariat, and others. The team leader will prepare an inception report (IR) including \na  background  paper  and  a  detailed  work  plan  within  1  month  after  acceptance  of  the \nassignment. The IR will be discussed at the intergovernment inception meeting/workshop of \nSAARC member states, which will deliberate on modalities for carrying out the SRETS. The \nmeeting/workshop will also be attended by the SAARC Secretariat, SEC, and ADB team. The IR \nwill also present the detailed scope and methodology to carry out the SRETS, for discussion \nand final determination at the inception meeting scheduled in February 2007. The methodology \nto carry out SRETS will have intergovernmental scrutiny before its submission to the Standing \nCommittee. The inception meeting will provide recommendations and clear direction for the \n ", "  5\nSRETS  to  be  conducted  by  national  and  international  sector  experts.  The  national  sector \nexperts  will  prepare  individual  country  assessments.  The  international  sector  experts  will \nanalyze the individual country studies and prepare a draft report from regional energy trade \nperspectives  for  discussion  at  the  second  meeting,  and  finalize  the  SRETS  incorporating \ncomments. The final report will be submitted to the Standing Committee for approval. \n \n20.  The capacity development programs will be implemented as agreed upon by the SAARC \nSecretariat, SEC, and ADB. This component will require about 16 person-months of national \nenergy experts and 8 person-months of regional energy experts.  \n \n21.  At ADB, an ADB TA team will be established, comprising staff of the South Asia Country \nCoordination and Regional Cooperation Division, South Asia Energy Division, Nepal Resident \nMission, Pakistan Resident Mission, and consultants, as well as other ADB divisions and other \nresident  missions  as  appropriate.  The  South  Asia  Country  Coordination  and  Regional \nCooperation Division will be responsible for overall TA implementation and close coordination \nwith the SAARC Secretariat and within ADB, while the South Asia Energy Division will take the \nlead in monitoring and overseeing the SRETS and capacity-development components. \n \n22.  The technical and logistical support component will be undertaken by ADB. A senior \nadvisor (international consultant) will be engaged for 6 person-months for quality control of the \nSRETS.  In  addition,  a  regional  cooperation  advisor  and  a  program  analyst  (both  national \nconsultants) will each be recruited for 16 person-months. They will be coordinating with the \nSAARC Secretariat, SEC, consultants, and ADB, and will provide logistics services for TA \nimplementation  and  other  activities  related  to  cooperation  in  South  Asia.  An  international \nconsulting  firm  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  quality  and  cost  based  selection \nprocedure to undertake the SRETS. The rest of the consultants and experts for the TA will be \nengaged as individuals. All consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor  preparing  the  Energy  Sector  Dialogue  and  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional \nCooperation Energy Center Capacity Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms \nImpact       \n     \nAn enabling environment for  Identification of energy  SAARC summits, \ndevelopment and more  investment options with  ministerial meetings, \nefficient use of energy in the  regional benefits, greater  industry publications, \nSAARC region.   awareness of such  journals, guidelines, \nbenefits and common  workshops, study \nguidelines, professional  tours, and \nnetworks, improved  dissemination of \nhuman resources, and  examples of best \nsharing examples of best  practice  \npractice.    \n \nOutcomes      Assumptions \n       \nA set of energy sector  SAARC member states\u2019  Periodic publications  \u2022  Participation and \ndevelopment options with  policy statements  by SAARC Energy  buy-in from all \nregional benefits  highlighting importance of  Center and the  stakeholders \n  regional cooperation  regional energy \nA report highlighting the  energy development,  professional networks   \u2022  Governments\u2019 \nbenefits from energy trade  security, and use     continued \namong and identifying  trade      commitment to \noptions in SAARC member  Participation of 300 energy    making steady \ncountries   professionals in study    progress in \n  tours, workshops, training    improving legal and \nIncreased number of energy  programs by 30 June 2008    regulatory systems \nprofessional with      and practices \nunderstanding and  Identification of at least 20     \nappreciation of regional  energy development    Risk \ncooperation   investment opportunities     \n  with regional benefits, in    \u2022  Economic or \nStrengthened capacity of the  particular with win-win  political disruption \nSAARC Energy Center   options   in regional \n    cooperation \nEffective sharing of \ninformation among regional \nenergy professionals on \nimprovement of systems, \nbest-practice examples, and \ncapacity building  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

Consultants will be recruited for the three components of the technical assistance (TA): (i) \nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Energy Trade Study \n(SRETS); (ii) developing the capacity of SAARC Energy Center (SEC) and (ii) logistics services \nand support. \n \nA.   Regional Energy Trade Study \n \n1.   Objective \n \n2.  The main objective of the SRETS is to prepare an action plan to improve regional dialogue \nand promote energy projects with regional benefits and win-win options. It will facilitate energy \ntrade  among  SAARC  member  states.  The  action  plan  will  explore  the  possible  ways  for \nestablishing better dialogue among SAARC member states to promote intraregional power trade, \nexchange of technology, sharing of examples of best practices, and better networking among \nenergy sector professionals. The SRETS will identify the major physical, institutional\u2013nonphysical \nconstraints hindering energy trade among SAARC member states and recommend an integrated \napproach to overcome these constraints and enhance regional dialogue on energy trade.  \n \n2.   Scope of the Study \n \n3.  The SRETS will be implemented as a set of activities. First, a national energy sector review \nwill be undertaken in each SAARC member states. During this assessment a detailed analysis of \nsubregional and regional cooperation options will be given priority among SAARC member states \nas well as neighboring countries. Second, parallel exercises will be carried out for identifying areas \nfor which sector reforms are needed. Third, projects that will yield quick and visible impacts will be \nidentified. Finally, it is necessary to examine options for undertaking poverty reduction impact \nstudies. \n \n4.  An action plan will also be prepared to look into specific proposals for establishing improved \nenergy trade links in the region including major transmission hubs, and to develop a time-bound \ninvestment plan with possible external assistance.
