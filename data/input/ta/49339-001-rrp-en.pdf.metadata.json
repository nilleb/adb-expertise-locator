INTRODUCTION \n1.  This  is  an  eligible  transaction  under  the  Faster  Approach  to  Small  Nonsovereign \nTransactions (FAST) framework. The transaction involves (i) a loan of up to $2 million from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) ordinary capital resources (OCR); and (ii) the administration of \na loan of up to $1 million to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in \nAsia under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility to Jarcon Pty Limited and Sun Pacific \nEnergy Limited (SPEL) for the Solar Power Development Project in Samoa. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project History and Status \n2.  The proposed financing of up to $3 million will expand an existing 2.2-megawatt (MW)1 \nsolar farm that has been in partial operation since April 2015.2 The existing facility was completed \nin  December  2015.  The  project  sponsor  has  already  invested  about  $3.5  million  for  the \nconstruction of the existing solar farm. The total project cost is estimated at $7 million. \n \n3.  SPEL,  the  independent  power  producer  (IPP)  sells  power  to  the  Electric  Power \nCorporation (EPC), Samoa\u2019s state-owned power utility and the sole offtaker of the project. The \npower is sold under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that was signed in June 2015. \nAn addendum to the PPA is expected to be signed in July 2017 to increase the offtaking output \nfrom 3.5 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year to 6.1 million kWh per year. 3  \n \n2.  Project Rationale \n4.  Increased access to and affordability of solar power. The proposed project will help \nthe  country  lower  its  dependence  on fossil fuels  and  increase  affordability  of  solar  power \ngeneration. Although endowed with abundant solar resources,4 Samoa is heavily dependent on \nimported fuel. In 2012, 95 million liters of diesel were imported for power generation to meet the \ndemand of a 98% electrification rate. Of the total nationwide installed capacity of approximately \n42 MW, over 30 MW is diesel fueled. \n \n5.  Since 2010, the Government of Samoa has promoted private sector participation to \nincrease renewable energy investment. There are currently three solar IPPs operating in the \ncountry, including SPEL. The other two IPPs are backed by larger international sponsors who are \nfunding the projects entirely by equity, resulting in higher project costs driven by the expected \nequity returns. SPEL is currently the most affordable IPP. 5 Given that the IPP tariff is passed \nthrough to the consumers, an expansion of SPEL\u2019s existing operation will improve affordability. \n \n                                                \n1  The solar farm\u2019s capacity will be expanded to a total of 4 MW (alternating current). \n2  The first stage (500 kilowatts) of the system started operation in April 2015. The system was developed modularly \nup to a capacity of 2.2 MW while generating revenues. \n3  The addendum, inclusive of a new tariff, has been approved by the Office of the Regulator. \n4  The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that Samoa has a daily average insolation of over 5.0 kWh \nper square meter (with relatively small seasonal variation). This is a promising insolation for both utility scale and \nhousehold solar power systems. International Renewable Energy Agency. 2013. Renewable energy opportunities \nand challenges in the Pacific Islands region: Samoa. Abu Dhabi. \n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "2  \n6.  Enhanced power system resilience. Samoa\u2019s hydropower systems make a useful \ncontribution to the country\u2019s power mix, but they are exposed to natural disasters and climatic \nvariability. They are also old manual systems, controlled by a series of hand-turned valves, and \nthus are not easily integrated into the national grid. The country\u2019s 12 MW hydropower capacity \nhas been adversely affected by past natural disasters such as the damage caused by Cyclone \nEvan in 2012. Hydropower generation is also exposed to seasonal volatility and drought. While \nup to 50% of Upolu\u2019s power can be generated by existing hydropower plants, hydropower \ngeneration only meets 19% of demand during the dry season.6 Solar power, on the other hand, \nis well suited for the dry season, when hydro resources are low and the weather is less cloudy. In \naddition,  the  solar  system  structural  design  has  adopted  international  standards  (e.g.,  the \nAustralian standard AS 4040.3, which considers resistance to wind pressures for cyclone regions) \nthat will help improve the overall resilience to extreme weather events of Samoa\u2019s power system. \n \n7.  Access to long-term credit. Accessing long-term credit in the Pacific island countries is \ndifficult  for  local  entrepreneurs.  The  lack  of  long-term  credit  is  particularly  harmful  for  the \ndevelopment of infrastructure that typically requires high up-front capital costs and revenues \nspread over a long period. The project is the first renewable energy project that is being developed \nas an IPP in Samoa that is seeking debt financing. Despite having funded over 50% of the project \ncost, the borrowers are experiencing difficulties in obtaining credit from local and regional banks. \nADB assistance will contribute to ease access to credit and support private sector participation in \nthe energy sector. \n \n3.  Borrowers and Sponsors \n8.  The recipients of the loan are two co-borrowers: Jarcon and SPEL. Jarcon is incorporated \nin New South Wales, Australia, while SPEL is a Samoan company. Both companies are family \nowned  and  have  the  same  ownership  structure.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Integrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.7 No \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified.8 \n \n9.  SPEL  is  the  owner  of  the  Samoan  solar  farm.  In  2016,  the  asset  was  valued  at \napproximately ST7.0 million. The Upolu solar farm was entirely funded through equity in the form \nof a loan from Jarcon to SPEL used to purchase equipment and services for the construction of \nthe existing facility.9 \n \n10.  While Jarcon is not formally SPEL\u2019s parent company, given Jarcon\u2019s role as financier and \ncommon ownership structure, Jarcon acts as co-borrower with SPEL.  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n11.  Impact. The impact will be increased availability, affordability, safety, and environmental \nimpacts of energy generation in line with the Government of Samoa\u2019s policy goal.10 \n                                                \n6  In November 2015, ADB approved a sovereign grant to provide resources for EPC to rehabilitate and reconnect to \nthe grid 4.69 MW of hydropower capacity.

However, the loan from Jarcon would be \nsubordinated to ADB\u2019s loan once the project is approved. \n10 Government of Samoa, Ministry of Finance. 2012. Samoa Energy Sector Plan 2012\u20132016. Apia. ", "  3\n \n12.  Outcome. The outcome will be an increased supply of clean, carbon-negative solar \nenergy generated by an IPP. The project will generate an estimated 5.5 gigawatt-hours of solar \npower annually for 20 years. The estimated carbon emissions will be reduced by 1,644 tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent per year. \n \n13.  Output. The project output will be the installation of up to 4 MW of solar power generation, \nowned and operated by an IPP. This will be a milestone achievement in the Pacific region, where \nprivate sector developers are hesitant to take country and regulatory risks, and struggle to access \nlong-term credit when they do take these risks. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n14.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \ninfrastructure and environment, two of ADB\u2019s five core operational areas, and is consistent with \nADB's Midterm Review of Strategy 202011 as well as ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, which is used as \nSamoa\u2019s country partnership strategy.12 As highlighted in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor Samoa, 2017\u20132019,13 ADB\u2019s past support was centered on the energy sector and has helped \nthe country improve electricity services as well as strengthen the resilience of renewable energy \npower generation against disasters caused by natural hazards. The project is also aligned with \nSamoa\u2019s Energy Sector Plan, 2012\u20132016. \n \n15.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB Energy Policy in promoting access to clean and affordable energy.14 The \nproject builds on ADB\u2019s sovereign operations in the energy sector in Samoa through the Power \nSector Expansion Project15 and the more recent Renewable Energy Development and Power \nSector Rehabilitation Project.16 Both projects are supporting (i) EPC\u2019s assets maintenance, \nrehabilitation, and expansion, as well as its performance, through the provision of a project \nmanagement unit; and (ii) EPC\u2019s ability to increase renewable energy and provide battery energy \nstorage systems. In addition, the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility recently approved an \napplication to assist Samoa\u2019s Office of the Regulator in setting out a power tariff policy and \nstrengthening the capacity of its electricity regulatory staff. The Asian Pacific Project Preparation \nFacility is also considering an application from EPC to provide assistance and prepare for the \noutsourcing of the operation and maintenance of generation, transmission, and distribution assets \nin Samoa. \n \n16.  The project also exemplifies the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, as described in ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020.11  Past  sovereign  projects  in  Samoa  have  contributed  to  the \ndevelopment of an enabling environment for private sector participation through the development \nof the Office of the Regulator. ADB sovereign projects in Samoa have also supported EPC\u2019s grid \nand generation investments and institutional capacity, resulting in EPC\u2019s improved operations and \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2014.

Project Cost and Financing Plan \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $7 million.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.17 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The Government of Samoa has been heavily invested in the power sector since \n2007, with a $100 million project cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank, the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, and the Government of Australia. The \nOffice of the Regulator was established in 2006 to regulate telecommunication, and \nwas also appointed the regulator of the power sector in 2010. The Office of the \nRegulator has the power to license utilities and approve tariffs, including the one \napplied by the Electric Power Corporation. \nManagement  SPEL was created with the sole purpose of owning the Samoan independent power \nproducer with the same structure as the Australian sister company (and co-borrower \nfor the project), Jarcon Pty Limited.  \nImplementation period  The existing solar farm started partial operation in April 2015. SPEL has continued \nto expand the facility, which had a capacity of 2.2 MW in December 2016. The \nconstruction of the expansion is scheduled to start in July 2017 and will be completed \nin 6 months. \nConstruction arrangements  The construction of the plant is entirely managed by SPEL. The construction is \nmodular. The latest progress report from the clients shows that the plant will reach \n2.5 MW capacity at the end of July 2017. Orders of solar panels and inverters to \nreach the expected 4 MW capacity are scheduled to reach Samoa by the end of July \n2017. \nOperations arrangements  SPEL oversees operation and maintenance of the system. Mr. Harrison visits Samoa \nregularly (at least once per quarter), and employs a certified electrician in Samoa for \ndaily operations and supervision. Some members of the neighboring community are \nemployed to provide system security and wash the panels regularly. \nPerformance monitoring  Key  performance  indicators,  including  output  and  outcome  indicators,  will  be \nreported by SPEL every 6 months.  \nMW = megawatt, SPEL = Sun Pacific Energy Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.

ADB\u2019s proposed assistance will consist of: (i) a direct loan not exceeding $2 million; and \n(ii) a concessional loan funded by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia under \nADB\u2019s Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, to be administered by ADB, not exceeding \n$1 million.  \n \n21.  In 2015, the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia also provided small-\nscale project preparatory technical assistance of $225,000 to cover technical and legal due \ndiligence costs of the project.18  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  The project is ADB\u2019s first private sector investment in support of an IPP for renewable \nenergy in the Pacific region. The Government of Samoa has been at the forefront of promoting \nprivate sector participation for renewable energy generation. While there are currently three solar \nIPPs operating in Samoa (inclusive of the one that the project is supporting), affordability of \nrenewable energy remains an issue due to funding and structural issues of the other IPPs (para. \n5). This imposes a larger cost on Samoan consumers who, while committed to greener power \ngeneration, also cope with low income and limited employment opportunities. ADB\u2019s long-term \nloan  blended  with  concessional  funding  is  improving  the  affordability  of  renewable  power \ngeneration for all. \n \nC.  Risks \n23.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n24.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n25.  Natural disaster risk. Samoa is vulnerable to natural disasters, particularly tropical \ncyclones which may result in extreme rain events and flash flooding. This risk is addressed \nthrough selection of climate-appropriate PV modules and inverters and incorporation of various \ndesign elements. However, there is limited historical rainfall and wind data from cyclone events \nto fully assess this risk.   \n \n26.   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n27.  Completion risk. The project is already operational and completion risk for the expansion \nis low given the conventional design structure and the sponsor\u2019s technical expertise. However, \nthe construction process, including procurement and staff engagement, is managed informally. \nThis risk is mitigated to some extent by the technical advisor\u2019s validation that the existing facility \nis well-designed and engineered relative to other projects in the region and that the contractors \nand subcontractors have the required skills.  \n \n28.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. An environmental and social audit has been conducted for the existing facility, \nand an initial environmental examination report has been prepared for the 1.8 MW expansion of \nthe solar power station in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The environmental \nconstruction impacts are not significant and are mostly directly related to the construction process, \nsuch as elevation of noise level, generation of dust and wastewater, and health and safety risks. \nThese are, however, localized and short-term impacts, as construction is scheduled to be \ncompleted within 6 months. Additionally, these impacts can be mitigated through the adoption of \ngood engineering practices. Notable operational impacts include potential water competition \nduring the dry season since the existing operations source cleaning water from the community. \nRainwater tanks will be installed to avoid this potential issue. Potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project have been identified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, \nand compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  SPEL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. SPEL will submit annual environmental and social \nmonitoring reports to ADB. \n \n32.  The project will be an expansion of an existing solar farm and will not entail economic or \nphysical displacement. The project site was previously unused land in a secure complex within \nthe boundary of Faleolo International Airport. No communities have resided in the project area \nsince its acquisition in 1942 to build the airport. The expansion of the solar farm will be contained \nwithin the subleased area, and no additional land will be acquired. \n \n33.  The project is categorized as having no gender element. Measures to benefit women or \nfacilitate their participation in the project are limited due to the size of the operation and the short \nconstruction time frame. The companies however, observe a no discrimination policy and is open \nto providing opportunities to a limited number of women during project operation. SPEL will \ncomply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will \ntake  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.19 The \nborrowers will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance with such laws, \nand  (ii)  the  measures  taken  to  assure  compliance  if  needed.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.20  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n34.  Jarcon and SPEL were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2003. Social Protection.

Investment Limitations  \n35.  Based  on  nonsovereign  operations (NSO)  portfolio  data  as  of  31  March  2017, the \nproposed transaction will breach Samoa\u2019s country exposure limit. The NSO country limit of 10% \nof gross domestic product, net of sovereign exposure, has been fully exhausted by concessional \nsovereign loans outstanding. As of the first quarter of 2017, total sovereign exposure was $99.4 \nmillion,21 $20.8 million above the $78.6 million that signifies 10% of 2016 gross domestic product. \nThis country limit was set prior to the transfer of Asian Development Fund lending operations to \nOCR, effective 1 January 2017. 22 Samoa\u2019s NSO limit was fully consumed at this point, essentially \nproviding no way for ADB to participate in NSO interventions in Samoa without a waiver. A waiver \nfrom ADB\u2019s Board of Directors will be sought in respect of this breach of the country exposure \nlimit. The Investment Committee supports this waiver. \n \n36.  The transaction remains within single borrower, group, and subsector limits. \n \nD.  Assurances \n37.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),23 \nADB will proceed with the assistance upon establishing that the Government of Samoa has no \nobjection  to  the  assistance  to  Jarcon  and  SPEL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n38.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) a direct \nloan of up to $2,000,000 from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ordinary capital resources, and \n(ii) the administration of a loan of up to $1,000,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund \nfor the Private Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility to Jarcon Pty \nLimited and Sun Pacific Energy Limited for the Solar Power Development Project in Samoa, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n21 July 2017 \n \n \n                                                \n21 Current exposure excludes potential impact of the following: (i) potential drawdown of undisbursed effective loan of \n$1.1 million, and (ii) repayments. \n22 ADB. 2014.
