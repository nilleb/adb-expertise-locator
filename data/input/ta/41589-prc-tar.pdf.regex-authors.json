During the 2007 Country Programming Midterm Review Mission, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to support the macro environmental strategy study and prepare a \nnational strategy for developing sustainable energy crops.  At the request of the Government, \nADB fielded a Fact-Finding Mission in Beijing during 5\u20138 June 2007, held discussions with \nrepresentatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MOA),  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration (SEPA), and Ministry of Finance (MOF). During the discussions, the need for and \nthe scope of a consolidated TA for national strategies for environmental management and \nenergy conservation were confirmed.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over  the  last  25  years,  the  PRC  has  transformed  itself  from  a  closed  agricultural \neconomy to a global industrial and economic powerhouse. The sustained and rapid economic \ngrowth resulting from this transformation has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty \nand improved the standard of living of all citizens to varying degrees. However, the distribution \nof the gains has not been widespread or equitable, and they have come at a significant cost to \nthe environment due to the accelerated exploitation of natural resources and massive increases \nin pollutant discharges. With the PRC\u2019s population predicted to reach 1.45 billion, with gross \ndomestic product of $4 trillion and urbanization of about 55% by 2020, the need to balance \nenvironmental protection and economic and social development is imperative.  \n \n3.  The  environmental  challenges  facing  the  PRC  are  diverse  and  growing,  from  land \ndegradation to water scarcity, and from air pollution to greenhouse gas emissions. The total \nemissions of major pollutants far exceed the environmental bearing capacity. Pollution problems \nadversely affecting water, air, soil, and solid wastes are significant. In addition, environmental \npollution-related accidents seem to occur more frequently, ecological degradation is escalating, \nand  the  ecology  of  major  river  basins  in  various  regions  is  severely  threatened.  The \nenvironmental protection targets set in the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) have not been met, and in \n2006\u2014under the 11th FYP period (2006\u20132010)\u2014discharge of major pollutants shows no sign of \nreduction but instead has increased.2  \n \n4.  The Government is determined to address the issues of environmental management and \nenergy  conservation.  The  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP  for  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment, which was approved by the National People\u2019s Congress Conference in March \n2006,  included  a  detailed  discussion  of  the  issue  of  building  a  resource-efficient  and \nenvironment-friendly society, with focus on promoting energy conservation and strengthening \nthe effort of pollution control. The 11th FYP also calls for resource-efficient agriculture and \npollution prevention in the agriculture sector. There are many specific targets for the 11th FYP \nperiod, but the two most prominent are the reduction of energy intensity of gross domestic \nproduct by 20% and the reduction of the total pollution load by 10%. The PRC\u2019s National \nClimate Change Programme, announced in June 2007, stressed the use of renewable energy \nincluding the development of biomass renewable energy (BRE) to reduce energy intensity and \nfurther contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Due to the interrelated nature of these two TAs as well as the limited number of TA projects to be processed in the \ndepartment, it was decided that the two TAs be combined. A consolidated concept paper was prepared and \ncleared by the Management on 3 August 2007.  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 \nAugust 2007. \n2  ADB. 2007. Country Environmental Analysis of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  In this context, the Government is developing a macro environmental strategy and a \nstrategy for BRE development. The macro environmental strategy refers to the strategy to \naddress long-term fundamental issues concerning environmental protection. In recent years, \nresearch on environmental strategy has drawn ever-growing attention globally, and several \ncountries  and  regional  organizations  including  Germany,  Japan,  United  States,  European \nUnion,  and  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  have \nsuccessively formulated their own environmental strategies. In 2002, SEPA began a research \nprogram on a strategy for environmental security, which played a crucial role in guiding the \ndevelopment of related environmental chapters for the 11th FYP. In February 2007, SEPA \nobtained the State Council\u2019s approval for the preparation of the macro environmental strategy \nstudy. One of the key challenges is how to manage the PRC\u2019s environmental challenges using \nOECD experience.  \n \n6.  BRE is a sensible and cost-effective way to address both rural energy gaps and the rural \nnonpoint source pollution problem. BRE is generated from animal wastes and plant biomass, \nand includes biogas, straw and stalk combustion and gasification, biomass power generation, \nand biofuels. The production of liquid biofuels from energy crops is one of the high priorities in \nthe  11th  FYP.  The  Government  released  a  policy  document  in  November  2006  entitled \nSuggestions on the Implementation of Taxation Policies to Support Bioenergy Development, \nand an investment of about CNY3.2 billion is planned to support energy crops development. \nThe National Development and Reform Commission recently promulgated a special program on \nethanol and biofuel development for the 11th FYP period, prioritizing the production of ethanol \nfrom energy crops like cassava, sweet sorghum, etc., and setting a production target of 5.22 \nmillion tons of ethanol annually during 2006\u20132010. \n \n7.  Although  biofuel  development  is  one  of  the  key  measures  to  conserve  energy  by \nreducing energy intensity, the Government is also aware of the necessity to balance biofuel \ndevelopment with food security, and ensure that biofuel development will neither impact the \npeople\u2019s grain consumption nor compete with food grain production for cultivated land. There is \nalso the concern that the extensive use of energy crops for biofuel production may lead to a \nshortage of edible grains and feedstock supplies. Apart from the food security concern, there \nare also some environment-related issues facing the PRC including (i) the appropriate energy \ncrops, locations, and environmental implications; (ii) the key environmental considerations (such \nas  water  availability,  nutrient  and  pesticide  applications,  carbon  benefits,  and  habitat \npreservation) in the production and distribution of energy crops; and (iii) appropriate agricultural \npractices suitable for ensuring soil quality, soil carbon, water quality, and wildlife population.  \n \n8.  Strengthening the environment and energy conservation are the strategic areas in the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  update  (2007\u20132008)  for  the  PRC.  The  TA  will  assist  in  \ndeveloping  the  PRC\u2019s  macro  environmental  strategy  and  preparing  a  national  strategy  for \nsustainable energy crops development, and will analyze international experiences on balancing \neconomic growth and environment protection; environmental management of air, water, and \necosystems; and energy conservation, particularly the use of biofuel derived from energy crops \ndevelopment,  and make recommendations for the Government to consider. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA aims to contribute to PRC\u2019s quest for sustainable development with balanced \neconomic growth, environmental protection, and energy conservation. Specifically, the TA will \nsupport  PRC\u2019s development of the macro environmental strategy and the national strategy for ", "            3\nsustainable  energy  crops  development.  The  TA  will  support  strategy  development  through \nsurveys,  analysis,  assessments,  and  recommendations  covering  institutional,  financial,  and \ntechnical aspects. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  To attain the expected impact, two components have been identified: (i) support for the \nmacro environmental strategy study, and (ii) preparing a national strategy for sustainable energy \ncrops development.     \n \n11.  Component  A:  Support  for  the  Macro  Environmental  Strategy  Study.  Over  60 \nacademicians  from  both  the  Chinese  Academy  of  Sciences  and  the  Chinese  Academy  of \nEngineering, and internationally and nationally renowned experts and scholars will be invited to \ncarry  out  the  macro  environmental  study.  This  component  will  introduce  international \nexperiences and lessons learned from developed countries and make recommendations for the \nselected thematic issues. The tasks under the component are the following.  \n \n(i)  Conduct research on balancing environmental protection and economic growth in \ndeveloped countries, and make practical recommendations for the PRC including \n(a) analysis of the relationship between environmental protection and economic \ngrowth, (b) analysis of the break-even point when environmental protection and \neconomic growth are in harmony, and (c) ways to solve the conflict between \neconomic growth and environmental protection.  \n \n(ii)  Study developed countries\u2019 experiences and lessons in managing air, water, and \nthe  ecosystem;  and  give  specific  recommendations  for  environmental \nmanagement in these areas in the PRC.  \n \n(iii)  Study environmental policies and institutions in developed countries to shed light \non how PRC could strengthen its institutional capacity, legal framework, and \nmarket mechanism for environmental protection. Specific focus should be on (a) \ndevelopment of environmental legislation and enforcement at national, regional, \nprovincial,  and  local  levels;  and  (b)  market  instruments  for  environmental \nprotection including labeling, pricing, insurance, securities, finance, taxation, and \neco-compensation. \n  \n12.  Component  B:  Preparing  a  National  Strategy  for  Sustainable  Energy  Crops \nDevelopment. MOA completed a national survey on current agricultural wastes and marginal \nland resources suitable for energy crops development. The TA will assist MOA in preparing a \nnational strategy with recommendations for short- and long-term strategic options covering \n2008\u20132020 for developing energy crops. The following tasks will be undertaken under this \ncomponent.  \n \n(i)  Assess energy crops development potential, i.e., (a) evaluate crops and crop \nspecies most suitable for various soil types, farming systems, and environment; \n(b) investigate and appraise water and land resources and adaptability, and \nrecommend possible energy crops for the selected areas; (c) develop an energy \ncrop distribution information base; and (d) investigate the global energy crop \nmarket and its impact on the national strategy.  \n \n(ii)  Analyze the production and marketing of energy crops at the farm and sector \nlevels. Specifically, (a) analyze the potential for production of various crops, labor \n ", "4   \nneeds,  financial  viability,  water  requirement,  energy  intensity,  harvesting  and \nprocessing, etc., in comparison with alternative food crops; and evaluate the \nfinancial feasibility of its production and marketing; (b) evaluate and recommend \nan optimal farmer-enterprise relationship model to secure a supply of high-quality \nfeedstock and ensure that farmers receive a greater share of the profits from \nvalue-added  activities  (e.g.,  in  processing);  and  (c)  recommend  a  practical \nvertically-integrated enterprise production model for sustainable energy crops \ndevelopment including tax/policy incentives in the PRC. \n \n(iii)  Assess social and environmental impacts of energy crops development, including \nproduction and biofuel development and its influence on the food chain, and \nrecommend adequate safeguard measures to mitigate the possible impact on \nfood supplies and the environment.  \n \n(iv)  Recommend a national strategy for energy crop development including (a) inter-\nagency coordination mechanisms, (b) policy instruments, (c) regulatory protocols, \nand  (d)  investment  and  financial  mechanisms  to  promote  public-private \npartnerships. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA cost is estimated at $1,300,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $900,000 on a grant \nbasis through its TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining $400,000 \nequivalent. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.
