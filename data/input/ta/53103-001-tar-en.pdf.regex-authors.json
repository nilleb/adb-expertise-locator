INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Pacific Region \nInfrastructure Facility (PRIF) by continuing to resource the coordination and technical assistance \nactivities of the PRIF coordination office for another 4 years, from November 2019 to October \n2023. The TA design is based on review of PRIF\u2019s current phase and consultation with PRIF \npartners.1 Cofinanced by multiple partners, PRIF is an investment coordination and technical \nassistance facility that supports the planning, prioritization, coordination, and management of \ninfrastructure  in  the  Pacific.  PRIF  aims  to  improve  development  effectiveness  and  the \nsustainability of infrastructure investments in Pacific island member countries2 by (i) strengthening \ncoordination among PRIF partners, (ii) improving infrastructure policies and regulation, and (iii) \nimproving infrastructure planning and management. A PRIF management committee provides \nstrategic oversight of PRIF activities, based on governance arrangements in the PRIF charter. \nPRIF partners chair the management committee on a rotational basis. The PRIF coordination \noffice is located in the Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The coordination office supports enhanced coordination and provides short-term TA to \nrespond to requests from PRIF partners and member countries.  \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with Strategy 2030\u2019s focus on infrastructure as a key development \npriority in its aim to tackle climate change, build disaster resilience, make cities more livable, \nstrengthen capacity, and foster regional cooperation and integration.3 The TA is also consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020, with its focus on reducing costs, managing risk, and \nenabling value creation.4 The TA is included in the Pacific regional operations business plan, \n2019\u20132021 as a 2019 nonlending activity.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  PRIF member countries face several challenges in infrastructure planning, financing and \nmanagement. Member countries are remote and have small populations, precluding economies \nof scale in infrastructure delivery and management. Given their narrow economic base, member \ncountries rely heavily on development aid and remittances. They also face frequent natural \ndisasters and climate change, resulting in additional unplanned costs. Policy, institutional, and \ncapacity  issues  also  negatively  affect  performance  and  sustainability  of  investment. 6 \nInfrastructure investment and service delivery in Pacific island countries lag well behind global \nand Asian averages. ADB estimates that the Pacific region requires $3.1 billion annually to fully \naddress its infrastructure needs.7 Development partners active in the Pacific have responded to \nthe region\u2019s challenges by (i) establishing PRIF in 2008, to provide better coordinated support to \nPRIF member countries, (ii) significantly increasing available finance to Pacific island countries, \nand (iii) providing long-term capacity development. \n \n1  The PRIF partners are the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, \nEuropean Union, European Investment Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, New Zealand Ministry of \nForeign Affairs and Trade, United States Department of State, and the World Bank Group. \n2  The 13 PRIF member countries are the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall \nIslands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. PRIF does not cover Papua \nNew Guinea. \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n4  ADB. 2016.

The Pacific Infrastructure Challenge. Washington, DC. \n7  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila (p. xi). \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Some of the key achievements of PRIF since its establishment in 2008 include: (i) \nfacilitation of strategic engagement between development partners in the Pacific, (ii) helping \nmember countries plan infrastructure investments and maintenance needs, (iii) providing a \nplatform for technical experts from PRIF partners in sector working groups to develop common \napproaches to sectoral challenges, (iv) supporting regional organizations such as the Pacific \nPower Association and the Pacific Water and Wastewater Association, (v) leading applied \nresearch on engineering solutions for local Pacific conditions, and (vi) rapidly mobilizing technical \nresources immediately after disasters.8 While the coordination effort of development partners has \nsignificantly  improved  over  recent  years,  the  recent  and  proposed  scaling  up  of  financial \nresources by development partners in the Pacific will require ongoing, long-term, and regionally \nfocused coordination and support for infrastructure planning, financing and management. \n \n5.  PRIF\u2019s first phase (August 2009\u2013April  2013) comprised a secretariat in the World Bank \nSydney office and a TA support facility at ADB\u2019s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney. \nThe current phase (April 2013\u2013October 2019) is being implemented by the PRIF coordination \noffice under a single ADB TA providing secretariat services and TA.9 \n \n6.  A 2019 strategic review of the PRIF, commissioned by ADB\u2019s Pacific Department in 2018, \nfound PRIF to be an example of best practice in coordination among development partners.10 The \nreview  found  that  PRIF\u2019s  activities  have  (i)  reduced  duplication  of  effort,  (ii)  supported \nopportunities for collaboration, (iii) helped identify and scope projects of interest to all PRIF \npartners, and (iv) facilitated a more open and cooperative donor environment. Key lessons from \nthis and previous reviews that have guided TA design include: (i) PRIF should strengthen its \nstrategic engagement with member countries on upstream infrastructure planning, priority setting, \nfinancing, and asset management; (ii) the PRIF coordination office should intensify benchmarking \nefforts, including strengthening data on infrastructure in the Pacific and engaging PRIF partners \non  results;  (iii)  PRIF  partner  coordination  through  sector  working  groups  and  the  PRIF \nmanagement committee should remain a core function of the coordination office; and (iv) PRIF \npartners and the coordination office should continue to support opportunities for greater private \nsector participation alongside individual development partners and the Pacific Private Sector \nDevelopment Initiative.11 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  quality  and  coverage  of  infrastructure \ninvestments and service delivery in PRIF member countries improved (footnote 2).

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  The TA will continue to support PRIF coordination office activities.13 The outputs of the TA \nare as follows. \n \n9.  Output  1:  Coordination  of  Pacific  Region  Infrastructure  Facility  partner \ninfrastructure investments in the Pacific further enhanced. The coordination office will help \nto align and coordinate PRIF partner infrastructure investments in collaboration with member \ncountries, PRIF partners, and other regional stakeholders. The coordination office will facilitate \nand  support  PRIF  partners  by (i)  coordinating  strategic  engagement between  partners; (ii) \npreparing and implementing a work plan approved by the PRIF management committee; (iii) \nidentifying strategic infrastructure issues; (iv) supporting and facilitating sector and crosscutting \ntheme  working  groups;  (v)  facilitating  increased  cofinancing  activities;  (vi)  monitoring  and \nevaluation; and (vii) undertaking communications activities, including a strategy and PRIF website. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Technical  advice  on  infrastructure  development  and  sustainable \ninfrastructure management provided to Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility partners and \nmember countries. The coordination office will manage the provision of technical advice to PRIF \npartners  and  member  countries  on  (i)  infrastructure  plans  and  planning  frameworks;  (ii) \ninfrastructure policy and regulatory advice; (iii) strategies and research on infrastructure sectors \nand crosscutting themes; (iv) project implementation and coordination advice; (v) infrastructure \nmanagement advice, including asset management, maintenance, and budget frameworks; and \n(vi) issues such as performance benchmarking, project scoping, innovative technologies, and \nprivate sector participation.14 The coordination office may also provide technical advice and \nsupport on crosscutting themes such as gender, climate change, and disaster risk preparedness \nand response. The coordination office will provide quality assurance of TA support, drawing on \nexpertise from PRIF partner sector working group members and specialist short-term technical \nconsultants. The TA may also pilot test community-based solutions and local materials, including \ndesigning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the potential to scale up and replicate the \npilot approaches (para. 17). \n \n11.  It is expected that member countries will continue to improve the quality of their public \nexpenditure,  maintain  or  increase  budget  allocation  for  infrastructure  refurbishment  and \nmaintenance, use infrastructure planning documents, and continue to demand external advisory \nservices.  PRIF  partners  are  expected  to  remain  committed  to  increased  coordination  and \ncofinancing. The major risks are (i) PRIF member country government agencies have limited \ncapacity to implement infrastructure plans, (ii) data availability and quality for analyses is poor, (iii) \nPRIF partner commitment to strengthening coordination and cofinancing declines, and (iv) PRIF \npartners do not allocate sufficient resources to accompany coordination office support and TA, or \nfor cofinancing and project investment. The TA will mitigate major risks by (i) refining the \ninfrastructure planning process to recognize and address capacity constraints, (ii) providing \ncapacity development activities alongside TA within the constraints of the TA budget, (iii) helping \n \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 TA is preferred over a grant-financed project approach because of the demand driven nature and policy focus of the \nproposed activities.. \n14 Economic infrastructure sectors are (i) energy, (ii) information and communication technology, (iii) transport, (iv) \nurban development, and (v) water supply and sanitation. Crosscutting themes include (i) climate change and disaster \nrisk, (ii) private sector participation, (iii) gender and inclusion, and (iv) sustainable infrastructure management. \n ", "4 \nmember countries improve data availability and quality, and (iv) facilitating ongoing dialogue at all \nlevels within PRIF partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $9.09 million, of which (i) $2.00 million (22.0%) will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1.00 million from TASF 6 and \n$1.00 million from TASF-other sources), (ii) $4.09 million (45.0%) will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Australia, and (iii) $3.00 million (33.0%) will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of New Zealand.15 ADB will administer the grants and additional cofinancing \nis anticipated.16 PRIF partners will also explore opportunities to provide in-kind contributions, \nincluding financing and implementing parallel technical activities and individual consultant roles. \nPRIF member countries will provide counterpart support in the form of country data, office \naccommodation, counterpart staff and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will administer and \nimplement the TA through the PRIF coordination office over 48 months, from 1 November 2019 \nto 31 October 2023. It is anticipated that a new phase could be explored in mid-2022 to ensure \ncontinuity. \n  \n14.  ADB  will  engage  consultants  and  procure  nonconsulting  services,  equipment,  and \nmaterials, following ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its \nassociated project administration and staff instructions. ADB will disburse the proceeds of the TA \nin line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). The coordination office will not undertake activities in member countries until no-objection \nletters are obtained. Upon TA completion, ADB will transfer equipment and materials either to \nsubsequent phases of PRIF TA or to member countries, as determined by the PRIF management \ncommittee. Training and workshops will be implemented through consultants\u2019 contracts.

Consulting services. The TA will require 241 person-months of international consultants, \n119 person-months of national consultants, and the services of consulting firms. ADB will recruit \nup to six full-time consultants\u2014four international (176 person-months) and two national (88 \nperson-months)\u2014and  one  part-time  national  consultant  (16  person-months)  for  the  PRIF \ncoordination office core team using individual consultant selection. The PRIF coordination office \ncore team will include a team leader, an infrastructure economist, two technical assistance officers, \na secretariat and communications coordinator, an operations and finance officer, a part-time \nmonitoring and evaluation specialist. The terms of reference for the core consultant team are \naccessible  from  Appendix  3.  Specialist  short-term  consultants  and  consulting  firms  will  be \nrecruited to support the coordination office core team and provide technical expertise for on \ndemand assignments requested by PRIF partners or member countries. The requirements for \neach type of expertise and the length of engagement will vary according to the scope of work and \nsectoral focus. The specialist individual consultants and firms will be recruited using a combination \nof individual consultant selection, framework agreement assignments, quality- and cost-based \nselection, and consultant\u2019s selection qualification. The coordination office core team will prepare \nthe terms of reference for assignments by specialist consultants and firms and submit them for \nendorsement  by  the  PRIF  management  committee  and  ADB  TA  supervising  unit.

The estimated value of the potential future assignment is about $200,000. Consistent with the Staff \n \n ", "6 \n16.  Work planning and monitoring. The coordination office\u2019s team leader will prepare a \nstrategic work plan in close collaboration with the core consulting team and the PRIF management \ncommittee. The requirements of the strategic workplan will be specified by the management \ncommittee. The management committee will approve the coordination office\u2019s strategic work plan \nand annual updates. The coordination office will prepare quarterly progress reports and annual \nreports for the management committee in an agreed format, outlining the activities undertaken, \nprogress towards targets, alignment with the TA requirements, financial reconciliation, and issues \nor risks. Sector working groups will comprise technical sector specialists from the PRIF partners. \nThe lead sector coordinators will guide the coordination office\u2019s sector work. The coordination \noffice will prepare a results framework to be approved by the management committee and report \nquarterly and annually against the results framework. The coordination office will conceptualize \nnew technical assistance and knowledge activities in collaboration with sector working groups, for \nmanagement committee approval. The coordination office will prepare a tailored dissemination \nplan when conceptualizing each knowledge activity. \n \n17.  Pilot testing. PRIF\u2019s research focus may require pilot testing potential project approaches \nto test local materials, low cost solutions, and other small-scale project approaches. During the \ncurrent phase of the TA, several studies have been prepared that explored new and innovative \ntechnology, material and approaches that support community-based, local and low cost solutions. \nSome examples where pilot testing could be beneficial include: Road Pavement Design and \nPavement Trials for the Pacific Region, and Affordable Coastal Protection in the Pacific Islands. \nPilot testing of the recommendations from these studies would provide the opportunity to scale \nup and include these solutions in PRIF partner and community projects. All pilot testing will be \nagreed  with  the  government  in  a  confirmed  aide-m\u00e9moire  or  signed  memorandum  of \nunderstanding. The proposed pilot testing activities will not result in any potential adverse \nenvironmental or social impacts.18 \n \n18.  Social media and websites. The current PRIF TA developed and maintains a website \nand social media presence.19 The coordination office and a specialist web services firm funded \nby the TA will continue to maintain the website. ADB will negotiate suitable arrangements with \nPRIF partners for maintaining the website and social media after TA completion. \n \n19.  Cofinancier requirements. Consistent with the cofinancing agreements, ADB will provide \nto each cofinancier (i) annual reports on implementation of the TA activities; (ii) unaudited annual \nfinancial statements showing receipts, income, and expenditures under the TA account after the \nend of each fiscal year; and (iii) a terminal financial statement showing receipts, income, and \nexpenditures under the TA and any remaining balance after the TA\u2019s financial closure. ADB\u2019s \nexternal auditor may undertake audits of annual financial statements at the cofinanciers\u2019 request. \nThe cost of external audits will be charged to the TA account and is in the TA\u2019s financing plan. \n \n   \n \nInstruction for ADB-Administered Consulting Services, (i) the initial request for proposal for the current phase in early \n2019 outlined the prospect of downstream work, (ii) the potential for continuation was considered in evaluation, and \n(iii) the downstream assignment would not be substantially larger in value than the original phase. \n18 Information on pilot testing is accessible from Appendix 3. Consistent with ADB staff instructions, the pilot-testing \nactivities will (i) not exceed 30% of the estimated ADB financing amount; (ii) not result in any potential adverse \nenvironmental and/or social impacts, include only activities that are category C for social and environment \nsafeguards; (iii) will comprise works, goods, and services for pilot testing covered by a procurement plan; and (iv) \nonly commence after pilot-testing sites, permits, and clearances, and treatment of assets are agreed between ADB \nand the country executing agency for the specific pilot test prior. \n19 The PRIF website (www.theprif.org) and social media follow the Guidelines on Social Media at ADB and the Branding \nTool Kit. \n ", "7 \nIV.
