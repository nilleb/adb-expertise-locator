In 2003, the Government of Bangladesh requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto  provide  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  preparing  the  Second  Rural \nInfrastructure  Improvement  Project  (the  Project),  which  was  included  in  the  2003  Country \nStrategy and Program Update. In August 2004, the Local Government Engineering Department \n(LGED), the executing agency, submitted a draft feasibility study for the Project, which was \nprepared  to  meet  rural  development  targets  under  the  Government\u2019s  rural  development \nstrategy.1While the feasibility study provided a good starting point and demonstrated the strong \n \ncommitment of LGED, further work is required to refine the Project\u2019s scope; improve the social, \nenvironmental, and economic analyses; and evaluate the proposed investments in the context \nof ADB\u2019s overarching concerns about poverty reduction.  \n \n2.  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh 6\u201318 September 2004 and consulted \nwith  representatives  of  the  Government,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  development \npartner agencies. The Mission visited the Brahmabaria and Kishorganj districts and conducted \ntwo stakeholder workshops. The Mission presented its findings to development partners and \nexplored cofinancing prospects. LGED provided staff, consultants, and logistical support for the \nstakeholder workshops and demonstrated a strong sense of ownership and commitment. This \nreport is based on the Mission\u2019s findings and on understandings reached with the Government \non  the  purpose,  outputs,  methodology,  key  activities,  costs  and  financing,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA framework is included as Appendix 1.2 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  most  densely  populated  countries  in  the  world,  with  a \npopulation of about 131 million and an area of about 147,570 square kilometers (km). As high \npopulation density is favorable for labor-intensive farming on fertile land and small-scale farming \nactivities, the agriculture sector continues to be a critical element of the economy, generating \nabout 30% of annual gross domestic product and employing about 70% of the labor force. For \ntrade in goods and services in rural areas, the development of rural transport and market \nfacilities is critical to support continued growth of the rural economy. \n \n4.  With about 50% of the population living below the official poverty line, Bangladesh is one \nof the poorest countries in the world, and economic development and poverty reduction are the \noverriding development priorities. As about 77% of the total population and some 90% of the \npoor live in rural areas, the agriculture sector requires employment\u2013intensive activities in the \nnonfarm sector, effective delivery of education and health services, and better protection against \nnatural disasters. The improvement of rural transport and market facilities is essential to meet \nthese needs.  \n \n5.  Bangladesh has an extensive transport system, which includes 236,728 km of roads, \n2,700 km of railroads, 6,000 km of waterways, two major seaports, and eight airports. The road \nnetwork consists of 3,086 km of national highways, 1,751 km of regional highways, 13,877 km \nof district roads, 35,582 km of subdistrict roads, 45,055 km of Union roads,3 and 137,377 km of \nvillage roads. Despite large investments in the road network, road development in rural areas is \ninsufficient to support rural economic development and the quality and carrying capacity of rural \nroads remains poor. Only 17,300 km (49%) of subdistrict roads meet all-weather standards and \n                                                 \n1   Planning Commission. 1984. Strategy for Rural Development Projects. Dhaka. \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 September 2004. \n3   Union road is defined as road connecting Union headquarters to subdistrict headquarters. \n ", "2 \nthe remaining subdistrict roads need to be improved. The Government\u2019s National Strategy for \nEconomic Growth, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development identifies the development of \nrural  physical  infrastructure  as  a  strategic  priority  for  poverty  reduction,  particularly  the \nsubdistrict roads and Union roads under LGED\u2019s management, and the village roads managed \nby local government institutions with technical support from LGED.4 \n \n6.  The Government\u2019s rural development policy guides the comprehensive development of \nrural areas and provides the framework for planning infrastructure investments to improve the \nquality of life of rural people by enhancing rural transport and market infrastructure.5 The policy \nemphasizes (i) the development of all-weather subdistrict roads, (ii) the improvement of Union \nand village roads to provide rural people with better access to administrative and social facilities, \nand (iii) the improvement of markets\u2019 physical facilities to make trade more efficient. Investments \nto  improve  rural  roads  and  markets  have  had a  positive  impact  by  increasing  agricultural \nproduction and rural incomes and reducing poverty. However, progress in achieving the policy\u2019s \nphysical targets has been slower than originally planned.  \n \n7.  To achieve the policy\u2019s physical and poverty reduction targets, the rural infrastructure \nsector  needs  continuing  investment.  The  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  develop  rural \ninfrastructure in poor parts of the Chittagong, Dhaka, and Rajshahi divisions, which have a \ngreater proportion of the poor and disadvantaged than other divisions and have received limited \ninvestment. However, inadequate funding for road maintenance is a major issue. Routine road \nmaintenance remains weak because of an annual shortfall of maintenance funds for the rural \nroad network. The Government\u2019s allocation for road maintenance needs to be reviewed during \nthe preparation of a master plan for rural infrastructure under the TA. \n \n8.  Under the Government\u2019s decentralization policy, Union councils have been given the \nauthority to plan, operate, and maintain local infrastructure, but their capacity is limited and \ncapacity-building  support  is  required.  Financial  capacity  could  be  improved  by  increased \nrevenue generation from rural infrastructure, which will require a review of ownership and \nrevenue allocation policies. Ways to increase the involvement of stakeholders in Union council \nactivities need to be developed, though the Government\u2019s commitment to reforming the local \ngovernment  system  is  increasing  local-level  participation  in  the  planning,  implementation, \nmanagement, and financing of rural transport and market facilities. While the Government \napproved new guidelines for local resource generation in December 2003, the capacity of local \ngovernment institutions to generate local resources and manage rural infrastructure needs to be \nstrengthened.  \n \n9.  Evaluations  of  rural  infrastructure  development  projects  have  shown  that  rural \ninfrastructure is highly effective in reducing poverty by indirectly generating income. Improved \nroads and markets have helped to lower marketing and vehicle operating costs and have \nimproved overall access to public services and economic opportunities. The poor in particular \nhave benefited, because they are vulnerable to high prices and irregular availability of goods \nand services. Upgraded roads have also encouraged private sector investment, especially in \nlocal trade and agro-processing. A recent review showed that rural infrastructure development \nprojects generated rural income, because 25% of the projects\u2019 civil works costs were paid to \nlocally hired unskilled labor.6 \n \n                                                 \n4  Economic  Relations  Division.  2003.

The lessons learned on subproject identification, design, and implementation and on \nroad safety and maintenance suggest that strong involvement by local stakeholders in planning \nand design will increase the usefulness, acceptance, and maintenance of rural infrastructure. \nParticipatory  processes  can  also  enhance  poverty  reduction  and  the  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure  benefits.7  Even  though  LGED  has  improved  its  institutional  and  financial \nmechanisms for road maintenance, the effectiveness of these mechanisms needs to be verified.  \n \n11.  The  issues  of  poor  quality  and  carrying  capacity  of  rural  infrastructure,  inadequate \nfunding for operations and maintenance, weak management of infrastructure maintenance, \ninsufficient integration of trade and transport services, and limited local capacity to manage and \nfund rural infrastructure have been considered in formulating the TA. The TA also reflects \nlessons learned about participation by local stakeholders, quality assurance in planning and design, \nsustainability of rural infrastructure, and impacts of rural infrastructure on poverty reduction.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  formulate  a  project  proposal  to  enhance  rural \nlivelihoods by improving rural infrastructure. Based on the successful implementation of rural \ninfrastructure development projects in Bangladesh, including the on-going Rural Infrastructure \nImprovement Project,8 the ensuing Project will improve rural infrastructure in the divisions of \nChittagong, Dhaka, and Rajshahi to replicate the on-going project activities using a participatory \napproach and improve local governance capacity to manage rural infrastructure in the divisions. \nThe TA will help LGED refine its feasibility study and prepare a proposal for an investment \nproject that is suitable for external financing and ADB investment, with an ADB loan envisioned \nin 2006. Appendix 1 presents the preliminary project framework.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The Project will be formulated by means of a participatory process involving extensive \nconsultations with stakeholders in relation to the planning, implementation, and maintenance of \nrural infrastructure. In addition to improved transport and market facilities, the TA will address \nbroader rural development concerns, especially in disadvantaged parts of the Project area. The \ninitial poverty and social analysis is shown in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The TA consultants will (i) refine the draft feasibility study prepared by LGED; (ii) analyze \ncritical sector policies; (iii) assess lessons learned, including reviewing the progress of the on-\ngoing Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project; (iv) formulate an implementation strategy that \nincludes selection criteria for subprojects based on their poverty reduction impact; (v) prepare \nfeasible plans for assessing project-related local needs and priorities and enhancing economic \nopportunities for the rural poor that would result from improved rural infrastructure; (vi) prepare \nfeasibility studies for three sample subprojects; (vii) prepare an investment proposal suitable for \nfinancing by ADB and other external sources; (viii) conduct institutional, environmental, and social \nassessments for the proposed investment; (ix) develop an appropriate capacity-building plan for \nlocal government institutions and LGED; and (x) analyze the  financial and economic benefits.  \n \n                                                 \n7  The Project Completion Report for Loan 908-BAN(SF) (ADB. 1999. Project Completion Report on the Rural \nInfrastructure Development Project. Manila.) showed an economic internal rate of return of 30.4% based on \ncalculations of agricultural production surplus and reduced vehicle operating costs. \n8  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nBangladesh for the Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila. \n ", "4 \n15.  An integrated approach toward accelerating rural development must generate economic \nactivities by improving rural infrastructure and strengthen the capacity of local government \nentities in relation to the provision of administrative and support services in rural areas. To this \nend, LGED plans to develop a rural road master plan by 31 December 2004. During the \nimplementation of the TA, LGED needs to (i) review this master plan with all stakeholders, (ii) \nprovide  development  partners  with  opportunities  to  participate  in  investments  in  rural \ninfrastructure development, and (iii) prepare a master plan for rural infrastructure that includes \ntertiary roads and market facilities.  \n \n16.  The Government\u2019s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper states that reorganizing \nexisting government facilities at the local level is important for (i) improving local governance, (ii) \ncreating platforms for participation by stakeholders in local development, and (iii) promoting \nempowerment  of  the  poor  through  skills  development.  Even  though  Union  councils  are \nsupposed to plan, operate, and maintain local infrastructure, their capacity is limited and needs \nto be strengthened, especially in operating standing committees and mobilizing and managing \nlocal financial resources. To overcome the limitations of the Union councils, LGED will prepare \nan action plan for improving local governance with assistance from the TA consultants and the \nLocal Government Division through stakeholder workshops.  \n \n17.  Depending on the TA outputs, the Project may have four key components: (i) building \nstakeholder capacity and improving local governance, (ii) improving rural infrastructure,9 (iii) \nproviding income generating activities for the rural poor, and (iv) providing institutional support \nfor  effective  management.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local  government \ninstitutions in order to reflect locally defined priorities in the selection of infrastructure and to \nmanage infrastructure effectively. The Project will upgrade subdistrict and Union roads in poorer \nand less accessible districts to all-weather standards, construct culverts and bridges to remove \nbarriers to access to rural roads, provide hygienic and efficient trading conditions in markets, \nand build safe and efficient boat landing facilities where inland waterway transport remains \nimportant. The Project will exploit opportunities to employ the poor, including disadvantaged \nwomen,  in  road  construction  and  maintenance  and  in  taking  care  of  trees  along  road \nembankments.  The  Project  will  help  LGED  enhance  its management  capacity  for  planned \nmaintenance of rural infrastructure through Union councils. \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  total  cost  of  the TA  project is  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent,  consisting  of \n$226,000 in foreign exchange costs and $274,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will \nfinance $400,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, financed by the Government of \nJapan. The funding will cover the entire foreign exchange costs and $174,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency costs. The Government will cover the remaining $100,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency costs by providing offices, field transport, counterpart staff support, workshops, and \nsurveys plus a geographic information system database. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare presented in Appendix 3. The Government was advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The  executing  agency  will  be  LGED  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment and Cooperatives. LGED will provide office accommodation, supplies, and field \ntransport  and  will  assign  one  executive  engineer,  one  sociologist,  one  economist,  three \n                                                 \n9   Taking into account the need for flood preparedness, the rural infrastructure will be designed to be flood resistant.  \n ", "          5  \nassistant engineers, and three community organizers as counterparts. At the field level, LGED \ndistrict staff, who will collect information and data for the TA, will support the TA. LGED will \nprovide the consultants with all relevant information about standard unit costs for construction \nand maintenance, socioeconomic and agricultural conditions in the project area, and capacity \nand budgets of districts in the project area. LGED will also provide the consultants with access \nto its geographic information system database, including poverty and accessibility analyses.  \n \n20.  The TA will be undertaken over 5 months starting in January 2005. ADB will recruit \nindividual consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The team \nleader  will  help  the  ADB  task  manager  identify  and  engage  suitable,  qualified,  domestic \nindividual  consultants  with  expertise  in  rural  infrastructure,  resettlement,  participatory \ndevelopment, institutional development, financial management, poverty reduction, gender and \ndevelopment  issues,  and  the  environment.  The  consultants  will  purchase  necessary  office \nequipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The procured equipment will \nbe registered under LGED and handed over to LGED on completion of the TA. \n \n21.  The TA will require 9 person-months of international consulting services and 27 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 4. The team leader will contract with reputable local institutions to conduct extensive \nsocioeconomic  and  engineering  field  surveys  as  benchmark  surveys  for  the  poverty  and \naccessibility analyses at the Union level. The initial baseline surveys will include data on income \nand expenditures, demographic trends, gender issues, health, education, local administration, \nand rural infrastructure. The survey teams will collect prior reports and review the costs of \ntransport and market facilities, prima facie technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and viability \nof rural infrastructure. They will analyze the incidence of poverty and describe its nature and \ncharacteristics and assess the attitudes of local people toward the rural infrastructure to be \nprovided through the Project. They will also examine the potential for adverse socioeconomic \nimpacts.  \n \n22.  The TA consultants will prepare an inception report 3 weeks after the commencement of \nthe TA. About 2 months after the TA has started, they will submit a list of criteria for prioritizing \ninvestment for review and comment by the Government and ADB. The consultants will submit \nthe draft final and final reports 4 and 5 months, respectively, after their services begin. The final \nreport will include a comprehensive feasibility study of the proposed investment Project along \nwith detailed social and poverty analyses; technical, financial, economic, and environmental \nanalyses; a land acquisition and resettlement framework; a project framework; and a discussion \nof participation, gender, and cross-cutting governance issues. This report will be presented with \na  draft  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  that  includes  detailed  supplementary \nappendixes.  The  proposed  Project  prepared under  the TA  will  be evaluated  in  a  tripartite \nmeeting that will include potential development partners.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nBangladesh is overwhelmingly rural, densely populated, and extremely poor. With about 50% of its population living \nbelow the official poverty line, Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world. Economic development and \npoverty reduction are the country\u2019s overriding development priorities. As about 77% of the population and some 85% \nof the poor live in rural areas, the agriculture sector requires income generating activities in the nonfarm sector, \neffective delivery of education and health services, and better protection against natural disasters. Improving rural \ninfrastructure  is an essential input for meeting these requirements, as emphasized in the Government\u2019s rural \ndevelopment strategy and in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  \n \nBangladesh\u2019s rural development strategy focuses on two important elements of rural infrastructure: transport and \nmarket facilities. Currently, an extension of the road network serves the vast rural areas and 1,400 out of 2,100 \nmarkets have been developed. Much of the rural infrastructure, e.g., rural roads, was built using labor-intensive \nmethods under infrastructure development programs implemented by the Local Government Engineering Department.  \n \nThe National Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty Reduction and Social Development has five strategic elements of \nantipoverty policies: (i) stimulating pro-poor economic growth to increase the incomes and employment of the poor; (ii) \nimproving the human development of the poor by raising their capability through education, health, nutrition, and social \nintervention; (iii) promoting women\u2019s advancement and closing gender gaps in development; (iv) providing social \nsafety nets to the poor; and (v) encouraging participatory governance, enhancing the voice of the poor, and improving \nnonmaterial dimensions of well-being\u2014including security, power, and social inclusion\u2014by improving the performance \nof antipoverty institutions and removing institutional hurdles to social mobility. The Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \naddresses the development of rural infrastructure as a critical factor in increasing farm and nonfarm employment and \nincomes, especially of the rural poor and women. \n \nAs rural infrastructure plays a significant role in Bangladesh, infrastructure development contributes, both directly and \nindirectly, to poverty reduction. In direct terms, the development of rural infrastructure provides immediate cash \nincomes. Estimates indicate that the cost of hiring local unskilled labor accounts for about 20% of total project costs. \nThe  Project  provides  substantial  employment  opportunities  to  farmers  and  rural  populations  in  infrastructure \nconstruction  and  operations.  Indirectly,  improved  infrastructure  can  reduce  the  cost  and  effort  of  transporting \nagricultural products. It can increase prices paid to farmers for their products; facilitate access to modern, improved \nmarkets; and improve access to social and welfare services (health facilities, educational institutions, financial \ninstitutions, etc.). Improved infrastructure also helps the diffusion of technology in agriculture.  \n \nA study of the impact of rural infrastructure development in Bangladesh carried out by the International Food Policy \nResearch  Institute  and  the  Bangladesh  Institute  of  Development  Studies  found  that  the  development  of  rural \ninfrastructure has far-reaching implications for reducing poverty by directly generating incomes. A study by the \nBangladesh Institute of Development Studies confirms that improving rural roads to provide year-round access to \ntransport generated significant benefits for farmers, women, and the poor. \n \nThe Government has formulated the National Rural Development Policy to guide the comprehensive development of \nthe rural areas. The policy attaches importance on creating efficient and effective local government institutions as the \ndecentralized decision making framework whining a participatory mode. The Government would adopt the integrated \napproach of the policy to expand employment and decent income earning opportunities in rural areas along with \nmeasures to enhance the capacity and power of the rural poor to develop, protect and sustain their livelihood. Proper \ndecentralization of the design, implementation, and management of rural infrastructure programs will ensure they meet \ntheir goals in relation to cost-effectiveness, maintenance, and sustainable generation of infrastructure services. To this \nend, rural infrastructure programs need to focus on providing basic economic and social services to poorer areas \nhand-in-hand with strengthening local government institutions, including various local agencies, nongovernment \norganizations, and communities, based on a sharing of responsibilities through experience and examples of good \npractices. The strengthened local government institutions will help the poor access services and demand services \nfrom their representatives.  \n \n ", "8          Appendix 2           \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                   \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPoverty Analysis. The most direct economic measure of poverty is based on income or expenditure. Such data are \ncommonly collected through sample surveys, such as household income and expenditure surveys. The small area \nestimation technique will provide ways to improve poverty estimates by combining limited survey data with more \ncomprehensive datasets that do not include income or expenditure data. Regression parameters are then applied to \nthe larger dataset to estimate income (or expenditure) for households, and the predicted income data permit \nestimating poverty at district level. Previously, the incidence of core poor as measured by the headcount index based \non direct caloric intake has shown an annual growth rate of 1.5% in the areas designated for the rural infrastructure \ndevelopment project. \n \nDistribution Analysis. To improve the impact of poverty reduction efforts, distribution analysis will be used to assess \nthe equity of project effects, that is, to assess the distribution of economic and financial costs and benefits and net \nbenefits between the poor and other stakeholders. During the feasibility study, the channels of effect need to be \nidentified to (i) determine how costs will be incurred and benefits realized; (ii) identify gains from the distribution of \nproject effects; (iii) assess how the cost burden can be acceptable to those who will pay; (iv) determine overall project \nperformance  and  returns  on  equity  considerations;  and  (v)  consider  modifications  of  the  project  design  and \ncomponents to enhance the impact on target beneficiaries.  \n \nPoverty Impact Ratio Analysis. This is intended to estimate the proportion of the net economic benefits designed to \ngo to the poor compared with total net economic benefits.  \n \nAccessibility  Analysis.  The  positive  impact  of  infrastructure  on  poverty  reduction  is  indicated  by  the  highly \nstatistically significant association of poverty with the coverage of irrigation; the access to electricity; and the \naccessibility of villages to other rural infrastructure, service providers, and employment opportunities. The Government \nhas a major role to play in providing these infrastructure facilities, as rural  infrastructure coverage is still at a low level \nin Bangladesh. To give priority to rural infrastructure development, the accessibility of rural communities to other \ninfrastructure, such as subdistrict headquarters, educational institutions, and health facilities, needs to be analyzed.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?

The consultations \nwill enhance the participation of women in project interventions and benefits.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen account for nearly 50% of the population in the project area, most of them engaged in farm household \nactivities. The technical assistance (TA) will analyze their needs and suggest ways to address gender concerns in \nactivities related to improving rural roads, growth centers and markets, boat landing facilities, tree plantations, and \nUnion council complexes. The TA will suggest that the ensuing Project create scope for participation by women in \nproject activities, beginning with participatory project planning and continuing through implementation, monitoring, and \nevaluation. It will suggest how to generate employment opportunities for women by involving them in construction and \nmaintenance through labor contracting societies and tree planting activities. The TA will suggest how to facilitate \nlinking rural women beneficiaries with different resources for ultimate sustainability of their livelihoods.
