INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Energy Strategy 2030 in achieving its \nlong-term vision of a reliable, sustainable, resilient, and reformed regional energy market by \n2030.1 The TA aims to improve regional energy connectivity, scale up investments, and achieve \ngreater sustainability and inclusiveness in CAREC\u2019s energy sector. To achieve these goals, the \nTA will (i) undertake preparatory works for the establishment of a new regional transmission \ncooperation association, (ii) strengthen government capacity to carry out market reforms and \nattract investors, (iii) establish a financing vehicle for green energy projects and foster consumer \nawareness of energy efficiency, and (iv) establish a women in energy program to increase \nwomen\u2019s participation in the energy sector.2 These activities are directly linked to the strategic \npriorities of the CAREC Energy Strategy 2030 and represent the first subset of actions to be \nimplemented as part of the strategy. \n \n2.  The TA is anchored in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 Operational \nPlan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2019\u20132024.3 It supports the \nplan\u2019s overall vision of sustained cooperation among countries as a foundation for advancing \ntrade, investment, and the provision of regional public goods; and closely aligns with its strategic \noperational  priorities  1  (greater  and  higher-quality  connectivity  between  economies)  and  2 \n(expanded global and regional investment opportunities). The TA is also fully aligned with ADB \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality); 3 (tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability); 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity); and 7 (fostering regional \ncooperation and integration).4 Moreover, it is closely aligned with the CAREC Strategy 2030 and \nthe CAREC Energy Strategy 2030, which are directly linked to the national strategies of the 11 \nCAREC member countries. 5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  CAREC energy sector at an important crossroads. While the energy sector has done \nwell in powering the countries during a challenging period of rapid growth, new dynamics on the \nglobal energy scene are rapidly changing the context in which CAREC countries will have to \noperate over the next decade. The shifting global dynamics that will influence the CAREC region\u2019s \nenergy markets include the competitiveness of renewable energy, the importance of scaling up \nprivate sector financing, the necessity of addressing climate change, ongoing price and supply \nvolatility  of  hydrocarbons,  and  improved  political  relations  in the region  stimulating  greater \ncooperation  and  inclusiveness.  As  earlier  CAREC  energy  strategies  have  not  adequately \naddressed these areas, the TA intends to offer a set of solutions that will prepare and equip the \nCAREC region to stay at the forefront of change under these new regional and global conditions. \nThe additional economic and social challenges posed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. CAREC Energy Strategy 2030: Common Borders, Common Solutions, \nCommon Energy Future. Manila. The CAREC Energy Strategy 2030 was endorsed by the CAREC Ministerial \nConference in Tashkent on 14 November 2019. \n2  The TA will appear in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website early in the third quarter of 2020. \n3  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n ", "2 \npandemic will make it even more important to secure reliable energy supplies and reduce energy \nshortages and interruptions, especially to rural and urban populations, important social facilities \nsuch as hospitals and schools, and businesses. \n \n4.  Political will and readiness for regional cooperation at historic peak. For the first time, \nthe CAREC region\u2019s energy ministers adopted a joint long-term vision for the regional energy \nsector and committed to implementing the CAREC Energy Strategy 2030 by signing a historic \nMinisterial Declaration on 20 September 2019 in Tashkent. The principle of \u201cCommon Borders, \nCommon Solutions, Common Energy Future,\u201d including a detailed 10-year action plan, was \nadopted as the central theme to advance the regional energy sector through this decade. The TA \noutputs are directly in sync with the endorsed action plan. \n \n5.  Mutual  benefits  from  cross-border  energy  connectivity  better  recognized. \nInterconnectivity between CAREC countries has improved since 2016. Flows in the Central Asia \nPower System among Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan increased \nalmost fivefold from 583 gigawatt-hours in 2016 to 2,659 gigawatt-hours in 2018. Despite this \ntrend, national electricity grids and gas pipeline networks are still planned in relative isolation. \nBoth electricity and gas grids in the region must become smart and incorporate market principles \nto incentivize a more integrated system that can operate more efficiently and help build flexibility \nof supply and resiliency for all countries. At the same time, trade needs to grow beyond traditional \nmarkets such as the countries covered by the Central Asia Power System and expand to South \nAsia, notably to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Being part of a larger electricity network and gas \npipeline system will allow energy to be traded at competitive prices, enable diversification of \nenergy  sources,  and  provide  more  reliable  service  to  consumers.  Thus,  creating  the  right \nconditions for regional actors to establish long-term regional network development plans is an \narea the TA will address in partnership with ongoing initiatives by other development partners, \nparticularly the United States Agency for International Development. \n \n6.  Structural  reforms  key  for  energy  sector  financial  sustainability.  Traditional \ngovernment control of electricity and gas companies in the CAREC region and the absence of \ncompetition have led to distorted energy prices, inefficient network operation, and deteriorating \nenergy infrastructure. The energy sector\u2019s deep-seated financial difficulties have resulted in large-\nscale subsidies in many countries in the region. Fiscal support needed to maintain subsidies \ncauses a substantial burden on economies, depleting public budgets. Sector reforms can break \nthis cycle and establish more market-oriented structures that will generate income and restore \nfinancial health. Several CAREC countries resolved to move from state-owned systems to more \nliberalized market structures, and reforms are already underway in some of them. Yet, capacity \nin some member countries to implement such reforms remains low. Therefore, the TA intends to \npromote knowledge flows across CAREC countries and equip them with the necessary tools to \nformulate appropriate reforms. \n \n7.  Private sector financing essential to meet investment needs. ADB estimated the \nenergy infrastructure investment needs of the CAREC region (excluding the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina) in 2020\u20132030 to be $400 billion.6 In 2020 about two-thirds of investments were public \nsector investments, yet this is only a quarter of the needed investment. Therefore, private \ninvestment is essential to bridge the widening investment gap. Creating the conditions to scale \nup  private  investment,  which  in  turn  will  help  diversify  exports,  create  jobs,  and  improve \nefficiencies and promote innovation, is one of the region\u2019s most challenging and important \nconcerns. Given the common challenge and the modest size of economies, a regional approach \n \n6  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n ", "3 \ncan help (i) promote mutual learning to share successful and less successful project stories; and \n(ii) in selected cases, attract cost-competitive private investments by aggregating similar projects \nacross countries in high-technology areas. \n \n8.  Strong economic and social imperatives of mainstreaming energy efficiency and \nhigher share of renewables. The region has some of the most energy-intensive economies. \nDespite abundant renewable energy potential, installed solar and wind energy capacity amounted \nto less than 1% of the total capacity in 2019. Renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, \nwhile capital-intensive, have shorter payback periods than conventional sources, making these \ninvestment options particularly suited to attracting private sector financing. Furthermore, leading \nfinancial institutions and large wealth funds in the region are highly interested in impact financing, \nwhich  provides  adequate  returns  on  socially  and  environmentally  responsible  projects. \nInternational financial institutions also have a strong commitment to expand climate financing. \nThus, there is a need to develop a robust pipeline of bankable energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy  projects,  and  link  them  to  a  new regional  financing mechanism that  de-risks  such \ninvestments and provides a menu of investment options, such as debt, equity, guarantee, and \nleasing, leveraging ADB\u2019s approaches and those of international financial institutions in other \nregions. \n \n9.  Developing human capital and inclusiveness key to a future-proofed energy sector. \nThe work force of CAREC\u2019s energy sector is relatively homogenous in terms of gender, age, and \neducational background. Women remain especially underrepresented, mirroring the global trend \nwhere women account for only about 20% of the global energy workforce7 and 11% of top global \noil and gas executives.8 Hence, there is substantial room for opening up the energy industry to \nwomen and diversifying the sector\u2019s workforce. A diverse and inclusive workforce has proved to \nmultiply output and boost organizational performance. Companies and governments that increase \ntheir proportion of female employees have a more engaged and efficient staff, perform better, and \nmaintain higher retention rates. Thus, the TA will promote gender equity in CAREC\u2019s energy \nsector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: energy security and regional connectivity \namong CAREC countries increased.9 The TA will have the following outcome: improved regional \ncollaboration, scaled-up investments, and higher sustainability and inclusiveness in CAREC\u2019s \nenergy sector achieved.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Concept for the establishment of regional transmission cooperation \nassociation prepared. As the regional grid expands, increasing cooperation among transmission \nsystem operators and appropriate regional governance structures are needed not only to maintain \nphysical infrastructure, but also to decide on future-oriented questions such as regional electricity \nand gas grid expansion, data sharing, and grid operation. While institutional structures such as \n \n7  Clean Energy Ministerial. Equal by 30: Gender Equality in the Clean Energy Sector. Paris. \n8  EY. 2019.

Manila. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nthe Coordinating Dispatch Center Energiya exist, they have a limited, strictly technical mandate \nthat does not include regional strategic planning for a forward-looking, expanded smart system \nbased on renewable energy. The proposed Central Asia transmission cooperation association will \ncomplement the  structures  in  place  and  particularly  focus  on  network  expansion  planning, \nelevating purely domestic planning efforts to a regional level by building a participatory process \nto jointly identify new projects of common interest and develop region-wide rules and standards \nfor operating the grid. This governance structure will be key to increase regional connectivity, \ntransparency, and trust, fostering expanded trade. \n \n12.  Output 2: CAREC energy reform atlas developed and private investors attracted. \nGiven the uneven reform progress across countries in the region in the electricity and gas sectors, \nthe TA will conceptualize a CAREC energy reform atlas and make it accessible to CAREC \nmembers through an interactive and user-friendly online tool. The atlas will comprise practical \nhandbooks and advice on issues such as tariff reform; unbundling of generation, transmission, \nand distribution functions; and the protection of vulnerable customers. In addition, the TA will \norganize two international energy investment forums to attract new investors to the region and \nfoster regional business-to-business contacts to stimulate private investment. Previous energy \ninvestment  forums  showcased  several  successful  ADB-supported  private  sector  projects, \nincluding in conflict zones and other high-risk environments, demonstrating the added value and \nbenefits of support for private sector operations in the region. The TA will also help develop a \nCAREC energy outlook and investment report to provide investors with comprehensive data on \ndemand and supply trends, and market outlook and dynamics to provide more transparency and \nhelp them make better investment decisions. \n \n13.  Output 3: Financing vehicle for green energy projects developed and consumer \nawareness of energy efficiency strengthened. In view of the low share of renewable energy \nand  levels energy efficiency in the CAREC region, the TA intends to create favorable conditions \nfor the greening of the regional energy system. It will focus particularly on developing access to \nnew financing vehicles for capital-intensive green energy projects and finding ways to raise \nawareness of energy efficiency among consumers. The TA will conceptualize a joint platform\u2014\nthe CAREC green energy alliance\u2014to convene project developers and potential financiers to \nidentify and attract sources of funding for a pipeline of well-developed and investment-ready green \nenergy projects. The long-term aim of the alliance should be to create a shared regional fund \naccessible to all CAREC members that will provide them with end-to-end solutions for cofinancing \ninvestments in clean energy projects. In addition, the TA intends to tap the huge potential for \nenergy efficiency in the region, especially through well-designed and -targeted awareness-raising \nand information campaigns for consumers with support from the region\u2019s mass media. \n \n14.  Output 4: CAREC women in energy program established. Given the low share of \nwomen employed in the regional energy sector, the TA will establish the first women in energy \nprogram in the CAREC region. The aim is to provide women with the necessary tools to build and \nboost their careers, join existing international networks, and become more visible in the regional \nenergy sector. Major flagship events, such as the CAREC Energy Investment Forum, will lead by \nexample by inviting women to make up at least 50% of speakers and panelists. To further raise \nthe visibility of women in the regional energy sector, the TA will organize a CAREC women in \nenergy summit in 2022. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUnited Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation \n ", "5 \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA through the Energy Division of the Central and West Asia \nDepartment and in close coordination with the resident missions of the CAREC member countries, \nthe  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Division  of  the  East  Asia  Department,  and  the  Regional \nCooperation and Operations Coordination Division of the Central and West Asia Department. \nCAREC\u2019s Energy Sector Coordinating Committee, which is an official body forming part of the \ninstitutional setup of the CAREC Program composed of government officials from the member \ncountries\u2019 energy sectors, will discuss, contribute to, and endorse the products of the TA. The \nEnergy Sector Coordinating Committee, the subworking group, and the task force will meet \nregularly, with support from the TA, to ensure full regional ownership. The TA will be implemented \nover 24 months (July 2020\u2013June 2022). ADB will recruit individual international lead consultants \nfor each TA output, supplemented by national consultants where needed. ADB will engage \nconsulting firms for complex products such as the preparation of the CAREC energy outlook and \ninvestment report\u2014a major product under output 2. ADB will engage another consulting firm to \nsupport the organization of three flagship conferences\u2014two energy investment forums and a \nwomen in energy summit\u2014and other regional meetings. An international coordinator and a \nnational coordinator will support communication with the CAREC member countries and regional \nstakeholders, and provide further logistical support to members. A web and graphic designer will \ncarry out other tasks, such as the development of a virtual tool kit for the CAREC energy reform \natlas (output 2), and ADB will engage a producer to realize the  planned radio and/or TV \ncommercials to promote awareness of energy efficiency via the local mass media (output 3). ADB \nwill engage translators to provide simultaneous interpretation during the flagship conferences and \nother meetings and written English\u2013Russian translations of the TA products.  \n \n17.
