INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy  2020  supports  water  as  a  crosscutting  core  business  area  of  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) operations for infrastructure and the environment.1 Consistent with \nthe  emphasis  on  results-based  management  and  accountability,  ADB\u2019s  Water  Financing \nProgram (WFP) sets an example by announcing these specific targeted outcomes by 2020: (i) \n500 million people with access to safe drinking water supply and improved sanitation,2 (ii) 170 \nmillion people with reduced risk of flooding, (iii) 95 million people with more productive and \nefficient irrigation and drainage services, (iv) integrated water resource management introduced \nin 30 river basins, and (v) improved water governance through national water reforms and \ncapacity development.3 At the Water Leaders Summit of the inaugural Singapore International \nWater Week in June 2008, ADB outlined a seven-point agenda for countries in the region to \nprioritize water investment, including increasing investments in water supply and sanitation in \nurban and rural areas, and adopting a comprehensive sanitation approach \u201cfrom toilet to river\u201d \nto  address  household  and  environmental  sanitation  (comprising  septage,  wastewater,  and \nsludge management and reuse).  \n2.  ADB has committed to increasing the coverage of sanitation, hygiene, and wastewater \nmanagement in the region through its Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020,4 supported by the \nWFP. The plan\u2019s priority for wastewater management is (i) expanded wastewater management \nand reuse, (ii) expanded knowledge and capacity development using technology and innovation \nmore directly, and (iii) enhanced partnerships with the private sector.  \n3.  This  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA) 5  will  support  the \ndevelopment and increased investments in wastewater management projects in accordance \nwith  the  Water  Operational  Plan.  Countries  in  the  region  were  consulted  on  the  TA6 and \ngenerally agreed that, if health and economic benefits are to be realized, septage, wastewater, \nand sludge management systems must be an integrated component of improved sanitation and \nnot an optional extra. The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Governments and donors often neglect sanitation in their development priorities. Many \ncountries will not likely reach the United Nations\u2019 Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for \nsanitation coverage; disparities between rich and poor and between urban and rural areas are \nsignificant.  About  1.8  billion  people  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  have  no  access  to  improved \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2 Improved sanitation is defined as facilities that ensure hygienic separation of excreta from human contact, such as \nconnection to a public sewer, connection to a septic system, pour-flush latrines, simple pit latrines, and ventilated \nimproved pit latrines. Sanitation solutions that are not considered \"improved\" include public or shared latrines, open \npit latrines, and bucket latrines.

Given limited freshwater resources and the huge demand for water, water pollution is a \nmajor problem in Asia and the Pacific. While efforts to meet the MDG target on sanitation are \nincreasing, they focus more on increasing coverage, particularly access to toilets. However, \nquality and sustainability of sanitation facilities and adequate treatment of wastewater and \nsludge remain an issue. Up to 90% of wastewater generated is untreated or inadequately \ntreated  and  dumped  in  lakes,  coastal  waters,  rivers,  and  water  courses  that  are  already \nstressed  and  polluted\u2014affecting  water  supplies,  human  health,  fisheries,  livelihoods, \necosystems, and economic development.8  \n6.  Attracting  additional  funds  into  the  sector  and  delivering  environmental  sanitation \nservices at scale remain a challenge. Currently, financing falls far short due to the unclear return \nof investments, the inability to scale up interventions, and lack of access to existing financing \nmechanisms.  In  particular,  wastewater  management  is  seen  as  a  very  poor  investment. \nTypically, up-front capital costs are huge, and inadequate budget is allocated for operation and \nmaintenance costs. When combined with inadequate capacity, lack of household demand, and \nlow willingness to pay, wastewater management becomes a low priority in government agendas. \nThe  private  sector  is  not  willing  to  invest  because  demand  is  not  clear,  and  policy  and \ninstitutional constraints make investments risky. Without support to make septage, wastewater, \nand sludge management projects bankable and sustainable, the business potential is not being \ncaptured. The development and implementation of viable and sustainable septage, wastewater, \nand sludge management projects require (i) enabling conditions provided by governments,  \n(ii) a paradigm shift in doing business in environmental sanitation, and (iii) adoption of cost-\neffective technologies. \n7.  Initiatives in wastewater and sludge reuse are urgently need to help relieve pressures \ncaused in water scarce areas, and address related food and energy security issues. Harvesting \nnutrients (for fertilizers), methane and biogas (for energy and carbon credits), and water (for \nirrigation,  power  cooling,  industrial  and  other  non-potable  uses)  offers  income-generating \nopportunities. Emerging trends in wastewater and sludge reuse show huge market potential that \ncan  change  the  economics  of  sanitation.  This  will  help  in  understanding  that  water  and \nwastewater have an economic value\u2014an appreciation currently missing in many parts of Asia \nand the Pacific. \n8.  The TA intends to move advocacy into potential business opportunities by conducting \nroundtables among stakeholders (primarily public sector agencies and private investors) in \nselected countries.9 Proven solutions that can be potentially applied to a local situation will be \ndiscussed at the roundtable as a sustainable business opportunity for septage, wastewater, and \nsludge  management.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  may  then  potentially  consider \ndeveloping these opportunities as investment opportunities with private sector participation. \n   \n                                                 \n7 World Health Organization and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2010.

Moving  forward  with  innovation  and  a  change  in  the  way  wastewater  management \nservices are delivered in Asia and the Pacific will require key drivers of change: knowledge, \ntechnology, financing and incentives, and awareness and advocacy. The TA goes beyond \nknowledge management, and advocacy and awareness campaigns, as it links to a deliverable \nthat is a sustainable investment opportunity to attract the private sector. To drive an innovative \napproach, it will be necessary to engage with: \n(i)  development partners, research institutions, technology, and service providers  to \nshare  and  assess  existing,  innovative,  and  emerging  technologies;  solution \noptions; and case studies;  \n(ii)  DMCs in country and regional contexts to raise awareness, analyze the pros and \ncons of the existing systems and identify real needs, recognize what technology \nand  financing  options  are  available  for  practical  and  doable  solutions,  and \nenhance DMC capacity to plan and execute actions that would result in increased \nsanitation and wastewater treatment coverage and promote the reuse of treated \nwastewater in their country; and  \n(iii)  the private sector to increase its role in applying cost-effective technologies and \nfinancing wastewater management infrastructure.  \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA impact will be enhanced sustainable investments in environmental sanitation \nprojects.  The  TA  outcome  will  be  increased  awareness  and  enhanced  institutional  and \nprofessional capacity of DMCs in developing viable and sustainable septage, wastewater, and \nsludge management and reuse plans and/or projects. \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will promote and support innovative approaches to the delivery of wastewater \nmanagement  services  through  knowledge  management,  packaging  of  technology  options, \nincentives  and  financing  mechanisms,  and  conduct  of  knowledge  exchange  and  capacity \ndevelopment  activities  to  change  mindsets,  and  expand  the  range  and  scale  of  septage, \nwastewater, and sludge management in Asia and the Pacific.  \n12.  Knowledge. The knowledge drive will involve building up knowledge on environmental \nsanitation solutions. The TA will provide support for the development of (i) a structured database \nof working models and case studies outlining the sanitation need, technical solution options, \ninstitutional settings, and financial viability aspects and application areas; and (ii) a virtual \nknowledge center, a free access web-based information system and network, for easy access to \nthe case studies, models, information briefs, technology and financing options, and investment \nand business opportunities. \n13.  Technology. The technology drive will involve more intense use of specific technology \ndatasheets and their applications for different treated output standards required for various end-\nuses,  and  will  focus  on  appropriateness  and  cost-effectiveness.  A  variety  of  options  are \navailable (conventional, innovative, emerging, under development, under research for future \npotential) for collection, conveyance, treatment, and disposal of waste and for reuse of treated \nwaste for different uses. Wastewater and sludge can be harvested for energy and/or nutrients, \naTnhde/ ovire w\u201ccs leexapnreedss eedn oheurgehin\u201d  adree ptheonsdei nogf  thoen c othnesu letanndt -aunsde ,d oa nnodt  nfeocr esesnavriirlyo nrempreenste nat nthdo seec oofs AysDtBe\u2019ms  \nimnteemgbrietyrs. , DBeocaerdn torfa Dlizireedct,o ersn, vMiraonnamgeemnteanllty,  osro sutanfdf,,  aanndd m laeys sb ee pnreerligmyi-nianrtye nins nivaetu treec. h nologies will be \npromoted where appropriate as part of an innovation-led approach to wastewater management. \nThe TA will provide support for (i) an inventory of technologies classified by treatment and reuse \n ", "4 \n \nor  recycle  applications,  and  (ii)  technology  datasheets  or  information  briefs  on  technology \napplications for different levels of treatment and standards required for various end-uses.  \n14.  Financing and incentives. The financing and incentives drive will involve development \nof business opportunity briefs, affordable and innovative financing mechanisms, and methods \nfor extracting resources (e.g., water, energy, nutrients) from wastewater to fast-track wastewater \ninvestment projects. If wastewater is seen as a resource with potential revenues, then the \nincentive package changes. The TA will provide support for (i) development of business and \ninvestment opportunity briefs based on prefeasibility studies demonstrating financial viability of \nsanitation solution options and dissemination for use by utilities, agencies, and other service \nproviders and investors; and (ii) preparation of a paper on delivery and financing mechanism \noptions (including public\u2013private partnerships), and design of project financing with incentives \n(e.g.,  wastewater  revolving  fund,  wastewater  bonds,  output-based  aid,  Clean  Development \nMechanism and carbon credits, guarantee mechanism, affordable lending terms, and other \nfinancing modalities).  \n15.  Awareness  and  advocacy.  The  awareness  and  advocacy  drive  will  comprise \naggressive development and dissemination of knowledge and advocacy products on technology \nand financing options, health and environmental impacts, energy costs and/or savings, and \nbenefits of various models of wastewater management to policy-makers, planners, investors, \nand beneficiary communities, including women. It will influence the acceptance of a mosaic of \noptions or a range of investment opportunities, among decision-makers. This component would \nbe  the  key  networking  and  knowledge  exchange  platform  through  roundtables  bringing  all \nstakeholders (e.g., public sector, private investors, technology providers, research organizations, \nusers) to discuss and move forward on identified business opportunities. The TA will provide \nsupport for (i) subregional and in-country conferences; investment roundtables; and capacity \ndevelopment workshops to trigger the use of technology and financing options, and move \nforward  on  the  identified  business  and  investment  opportunities;  (ii)  advocacy  product \ndevelopment  and  dissemination,  e.g.,  policy  briefs,  multimedia,  articles,  brochures,  among \nothers; and (iii) knowledge product development and dissemination, e.g., toolkits on a range of \ntechnology options and financing arrangements, and other training and instructive materials. \nC.    Cost and Financing  \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 2.  \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The Sustainable Infrastructure Division of \nthe Regional and Sustainable Development Department will be the focal point for this TA. It will \nbe responsible for coordinating TA activities in collaboration with regional departments and with \nsupport from dedicated consultants in the areas of knowledge management, sector data and \nresearch,  financing  and  partnership  arrangements,  and  fund  and  administrative  support. \nActivities  under  the  knowledge  and  technology  drives  will  be  region-wide.  Case  studies, \ntechnology and financing options and applications, and other related information would come \nfrom various DMCs as well as other regions and sectors. Activities under the financing and \nincentives  drive  and  awareness  and  advocacy  drive,  such  as  subregional  and  in-country \ndialogue,  investor  roundtables,  prefeasibility  studies,  business  opportunity  briefs,  capacity \ndevelopment workshops, and pre-project preparatory work will be conducted in the eight priority \ncountries.10 The roundtables to discuss investment and business opportunity briefs will be taken \n                                                 \n10 Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. \n ", "  5 \nup only where the government and stakeholders show interest, and utilities show commitment in \ndeveloping the projects for investment. Actual development into projects and/or investments and \nproject implementation are outside the scope of the TA.  \n18.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  March  2012  to  February  2016.  The  Sustainable \nInfrastructure Division will prepare required progress reports, supervise TA activities, and make \nreports available through the ADB water website. The Water Community of Practice will monitor \nTA progress. The TA progress and outputs will be disseminated through websites of ADB and \nthe Japan Sanitation Consortium, which is the regional sanitation knowledge hub of the Asia-\nPacific  Water  Forum.  Knowledge  sharing  will  be  through  the  dissemination  of  knowledge \nproducts, and through seminars of the Water Community of Practice, and other events, forums, \nand workshops. \n19.  The  development  partners  are  expected  to  support  TA  implementation.  Support \nidentified  for  each  partner  in  the  Omega  Action  Alliance  includes  the  (i)  United  Nations \nSecretary-General's Advisory Board, as the networking partner, will assist in advocacy and \nfinding financial support; and (ii) International Water Association and Center for Science and \nEnvironment will provide case studies and technical and knowledge support. During the Second \nADB\u2013DMC and Partners Sanitation Dialogue in May 2011, development partners, and private \nsector and civil society representatives committed to contribute to the implementation of each of \nthe drivers. A change of the TA scope may be required to include any additional financing made \navailable by other partners or agencies.  \n20.  Approximately  23  person-months  of  two  international  consultants  and  142  person-\nmonths of five national consultants will be needed for TA implementation. The major areas of \nexpertise are expected to include the technical, economic, financial, policy, institutional, social, \nenvironmental,  information  technology  and  multimedia  disciplines  related  to  septage, \nwastewater,  and  sludge  management  investments,  technology  and  financing  options, \nknowledge  management,  advocacy,  and  capacity  development.  The  consultants  will  be \nrecruited as individual consultants, with significant inputs from national consultants, under the \noversight of an international specialist. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Resource persons will be recruited for the 10 \nsubregional  and  country  workshops  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. The TA does not envisage contracting the partner institutions directly. Partners are \nexpected to identify 10 case studies and contribute information in a specified template. Site \nvisits may be necessary to prepare the information as a knowledge product.  \n21.  Appendix 4 shows the framework for the four key drivers of change for the promotion of \ninnovative approaches in the delivery of wastewater management services, and the framework \nof the roles and responsibilities of each institution and organization.  \n22.  ADB will procure equipment and materials financed by the TA in accordance with its \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \nIV.
