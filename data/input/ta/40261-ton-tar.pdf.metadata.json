The  Government  of  Tonga  has  approved  its  Strategic  Development  Plan  Eight, \n2006/07\u20132008/09 (SDP-8), prepared with the support of technical assistance funded by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).1 The Plan presents a development vision and medium-term \nnational  development  goals  for  Tonga.  During  the  Country  Contact  Mission  (18\u201320  March \n2006),  the  Government  requested  further  ADB  TA  support  for  implementing  SDP-8.  This \nassistance will build on the achievements of ADB\u2019s previous work that included a $10 million \nEconomic  and  Public  Sector  Reform  Program  (EPSRP)  loan,2  TA  for  preparing  and \nimplementing the EPSRP in 2002\u20132005,3 and TA in 2005\u20132006 for formulating SDP-8. During \nthe Development Partners\u2019 Forum in July 2006, the Government, ADB, the Australian Agency \nfor International Development (AusAID), the New Zealand Agency for International Aid and \nDevelopment (NZAID), and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) of the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  reached  understanding  on  the  scope  of  the  TA,  cost \nestimates, implementation arrangements, and the detailed terms of reference. The proposed TA \nhas been included in the revised TA program for 2006 and is consistent with the strategic \nobjectives of The Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank 2005\u20132009.4  The concept \npaper for the TA was approved by the Vice President (Operations 2) on 7 July 2006. The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Tonga has made substantial progress in human development since the 1950s and ranks \n54th  among  the  177  developing  countries  covered  by  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP)\u2019s 2005 Human Development Report.6 Tonga has also made \u201cgood and \nsteady progress\u201d toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).7 \n3.  However, the real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown slowly over the past several \ndecades (1.5\u20132.0%) with GDP per capita measuring only 27% of the average for the countries \nranking high in the human development index. Slow output growth has been mirrored by slow \nemployment  growth  and  an  increase  in  youth  unemployment\u2013\u2013associated  with  growing \nproblems of crime and drug abuse. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000/018 \nrevealed significant inequality in income distribution among households, with approximately 5% \nof the families lying below the national food poverty line level and 22% below the basic needs \npoverty line.9  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

From early 2002, the Government has been addressing the slow economic growth, \ninequality  in  income  distribution,  unemployment,  and  poverty  through  the  design  and \nimplementation of the EPSRP. The objectives of the EPSRP were to (i) achieve sustainable \nfiscal  balance  by  strengthening  public  expenditure  management,  enhancing  revenue \ngeneration, and improving efficiency and effectiveness of resource management in the public \nenterprise sector; (ii) improve public service delivery to the private sector and the general public \nby establishing an institutional framework for a performance-oriented civil service and promoting \nefficient and effective performance management; (iii) improve financial sector performance by \nraising  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  and  management  and  enhancing  financial \nintermediation by the Tonga Development Bank (TDB); (iv) facilitate private sector-led growth by \nimproving  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  local  and  foreign  investment  and  by \nintroducing and progressively implementing tax reform; and (v) mitigate the economic and social \nimpact of the reform program by improving the quality of socioeconomic data production and \ndissemination  and  by  establishing  in  the  Central  Planning  Department  (CPD)  a  unit  for \nmonitoring economic and social impact.  \n \n5.  Significant  progress  was  achieved  under  the  EPSRP  in  2002\u20132005,  particularly  in \ncreating  institutional  and  legislative  frameworks  for  public  financial  management,  public \nenterprise management, and public service delivery. Key legislation passed included the Public \nFinance Management Act 2002, the Revenue Services Administration Act 2002, the Public \nEnterprises Act 2002, and the Public Service Act 2002. Corporate planning was introduced in \nthe public service, along with a code of conduct, performance agreements for department \nheads, and a merit-based remuneration and a performance evaluation system. Also, legislation \nwas  introduced  to  improve  financial  sector  performance,10  and  TDB  achieved  a  stronger \nfinancial and overall performance. A tax reform package intended to reduce reliance on trade \ntaxes was approved in January 2002.11 The Government\u2019s commitment to trade liberalization \nand trade facilitation continued, with the signing of the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement \nand the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER), progress on Tonga\u2019s accession \nto the World Trade Organization, and continued negotiations with the European Union on a new \ntrade  arrangement  under  the  Economic  Partnership  Agreement.  The  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment for local and foreign investment was improved with the passage of the Foreign \nInvestment Act 2002 and the Business Licenses Act 2002, both contributing to the streamlining \nof business procedures.  \n \n6.  However,  the  EPSRP  was  not  fully  implemented  and,  in  late  2005,  it  required \nreformulation in light of the economic and political developments. Progress had been delayed in \npassing  amendments  to  the  National  Reserve  Bank  of  Tonga  (NRBT)  Act  aimed  at \nstrengthening  NRBT\u2019s  capacity  to  conduct  monetary  policy;  repealing  the  Industrial \nDevelopment  Incentives  Act  1978  (IDIA);  and  implementing  the  full  tax  reform  package.12 \nGenerally, preparation of regulations supporting the newly adopted legislations was slow and \nlaw  enforcement  remained  weak  due  to  resource  constraints.  Importantly,  the  issue  of \n                                                 \n10 The Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act 2000 provided the legislative framework for combating money \nlaundering and terrorist financing; an amendment to the Criminal Offences Act criminalizes financing of terrorism; and the \nnew Financial Institutions Act 2004 brought the licensing and supervision of licensed financial institutions in line with \ninternationally accepted standards. \n11 The package consisted of (i) the introduction of a broad-based single-rate consumption tax (CT) for large businesses \n(annual turnover above $100,000), (ii) a simplified corporate income tax, (iii) a simplified personal income tax, (iv) a \nuniform customs duty rate, and (v) the repeal of tax incentives under the Industrial Development Incentives Act (IDIA) and \ntheir replacement by accelerated depreciation and investment allowances. \n12 Parliament ratified the CT in October 2003, and in April 2005, a 15% CT was introduced in place of the domestic sales \ntax and the port and services tax. Other tax reforms intended for early 2005 were deferred. ", "  3\nrightsizing the public service remained to be fully addressed and performance measures were \nstill to yield a clear improvement in public service delivery. Finally, while the Economic and \nSocial  Impact  Monitoring  Unit  was  added  to  CPD\u2019s  organizational  structure,  it  remained \nunderstaffed;  and  improving  the  range,  reliability  and  timeliness  of  statistics  remained  a \nchallenge associated with significant capacity constraints. \n  \n7.  Macroeconomic performance in 2002\u20132005 fell short of EPSRP targets for inflation and \ngrowth. The EPSRP annual target was GDP growth over 3%, and annual inflation target less \nthan 5% annually. Real GDP growth accelerated to just over 3% in FY2002/03, but fell to 1.4% \nin FY2003/04, 2.3% in FY2004/05, and 1.9% in FY2005/06. During FY2002\u2013FY2005, inflation \nremained at double-digit levels, coming down to 8% in FY2005/06.  \n \n8.  Furthermore, the achievements in macroeconomic stability came under threat due to the \nlarge public service wage increase granted after a 6-week civil service strike in July\u2013September \n2005. Meeting the FY2005/06 salary payout required canceling the capital expenditure program, \nfreezing the 899 vacancies in the public service establishment of about 5,500 (as of 1 July \n2005), and severely cutting operating expenditures. Moreover, a major fiscal problem looms in \nFY2006/07, when the postponed payment balance of 40% of the salary increases has to be \npaid together with the full 100% of the salary increase for the fiscal year.  \n \n9.  The Government responded to the civil service strikers\u2019 demands for political reform by \nestablishing  Tonga\u2019s  National  Committee  on  Political  Reform,  mandated  to  review  the \nconstitution and political system in a consultative manner in 2006, drawing on the views of the \nresident and overseas Tongans as well as on those of civil society organizations. Furthermore, \nfor the first time, a People\u2019s Representative in Parliament was confirmed as Prime Minister.  \n \n10.  The fiscal challenge was met as part of the finalization and endorsement of SDP-8 in \nJune 2006. Formulated on the basis of a lengthy and extensive consultative process, SDP-8 \npresents  eight  medium-term  national  development  goals:  (i)  creating  a  better  governance \nenvironment (including political reform), (ii) ensuring macroeconomic stability, (iii) promoting \nsustained private sector-led economic growth, (iv) ensuring equitable distribution of the benefits \nof growth, (v) improving education standards, (vi) improving health standards, (vii) ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability and reduced disaster risk, and (viii) maintaining social cohesion and \ncultural  identity.  Actions  contributing  to  the  achievement  of  better  governance  and \nmacroeconomic stability included a major restructuring of public administration and downsizing \nof the public service through a voluntary redundancy program, both initiated in the first half of \n2006. The two actions are complemented by a set of integrated Government initiatives for \nfurther strengthening public sector governance, namely: (i) preparing a cabinet office manual \nbacked  with  formal  induction  for  the  current  and  future  cabinet  ministers,  (ii)  employing \nconsultative  development  planning  in  setting  objectives  and  development  strategies,  (iii) \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  to  support  alignment  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s work program with SDP-8, (iv) formulating and implementing a leadership code \nand strengthening the Office of the Commissioner for Public Relations, (v) strengthening public \nfinancial management, and (vi) integrating and standardizing the assessment and approval of \naid-funded and budget-funded expenditures in alignment with SDP-8.  \n \n11.  SDP-8 sets out a comprehensive medium-term reform agenda to be implemented within \nthe new government structure. The Government is committed to completing the implementation \nof the EPSRP and expanding EPSRP\u2019s objectives into a second phase of an economic and \npublic sector reform program with technical assistance from development partners. Through this \nsecond  phase,  SDP-8  strategies  will  be  implemented  in  ministries\u2019  corporate  and  annual \n ", "4   \nmanagement plans and funded through a combination of support of annual budgets (preferably \nto be financed by development partners on a grant basis), and technical assistance. \n \n12.  The proposed TA will help implement SDP-8 in areas related to economic and public \nsector reforms. The TA will, in the context of a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, estimate the \ncost of EPSRP-related road maps to achieve SDP-8 goals.  \n    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The overall goal of the TA is to improve economic and public sector management in \nTonga by ensuring that the Government is able to align its policies, strategies, expenditures, \nand  work  program  with  SDP-8,  including  recommending  policies  and  measures  for \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  assistance  to  the  Government.  Appropriate  capacity  building  will, \ntherefore,  be  required  to  assure  sustainable  management  of  SDP-8  implementation.  The \nexpected TA outcome is that Government decision making\u2013\u2013particularly on budgeting\u2013\u2013will be \nconsistent with SDP-8 priorities. Government agencies\u2019 will be more cost-effective through a \nbetter focus on service delivery, and the Government\u2019s development partners will have greater \nconfidence that their support is being appropriately targeted. The expected TA outputs are \nreports that will assist the Government in implementing SDP-8\u2013\u2013especially with economic and \npublic sector management, community consultations, and participation activities to help align \nSDP-8 implementation with the aspirations that the stakeholders have expressed during the \ndevelopment of SDP-8. The policy measures and action programs will focus on the governance \nenvironment, macroeconomic stability, private sector-led development, and pro-poor policies. \nThe aim will be to: (i) improve the Government\u2019s cost-effectiveness in achieving development \nresults; (ii) mitigate negative social risks of the reforms; and (iii) conduct meaningful policy \ndialogue  in  a  coordinated  and  comprehensive  manner,  within  the  Government  and  with \nstakeholders, and with Tonga\u2019s development partners. These activities will draw on outputs \nproduced by previous TAs for the design and implementation of the first phase of the EPSRP \nand the formulation of SDP-8. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will use consultative and participatory processes with focus on ensuring: (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s sense of ownership of the components and results of the EPSRP in its second \nphase, (ii) harmonization among development partners on the content and financing of the \nEPSRP, and (iii) broad-based support of the program\u2019s objectives by the beneficiaries. Through \nthis  process,  the  TA  will  be  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  government  officials, \ndevelopment partners, private sector organizations, and civil society organizations. The TA will \nbuild on findings from the previous and current assistance of ADB and other funding agencies in \nareas related to the EPSRP.  \n15.  The key TA activities include: (i) assisting the Government with preparing a sustainable \nstrategy for implementing SDP-8; (ii) preparing the second phase of the EPSRP in support of the \nSDP-8;  and  (iii)  preparing  and  conducting  consultative  workshops  and  seminars  with \nGovernment agencies, civil society, the private sector, development partners, and other relevant \nstakeholders.  ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA will be $637,500 equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $510,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance  funding  program.  The  Government  will  provide  $127,500  equivalent,  for  local \ncurrency  costs  in  the  form  of  services  and  facilities,  including  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, and transport and administrative resources. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA is expected to begin in December 2006 and be completed by August 2007. The \nTA will require 20 person-months of international consulting services. The consultant team will \ncomprise  three  experts  (person-months  are  in  parentheses):  (i)  a  macroeconomics/public \nfinance specialist (8), (ii) a monetary economics/financial sector specialist (8), and (iii) a private \nsector development/outsourcing specialist (4). The consultants will be recruited individually. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The team of consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n18.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) will be the Executing Agency \nfor the TA. It will provide office space, adequate counterpart staff, workshop and seminar \nvenues, and local transportation. The reform subcommittee of the Cabinet on Economic Affairs \nunder  the  chairmanship  of  the  Prime  Minister  will  provide  overall  guidance  in  TA \nimplementation. Workshops, conferences, and national hearings will be implemented by the \nsecretariat of the reform subcommittee.  \n \n19.  The consultants will prepare: (i) an inception report, (ii) an interim progress report, (iii) a \ndraft final report, and (iv) a final report. The recommendations of the draft final report will be \ndiscussed at a consultative meeting involving ADB, MFEP and other government agencies, \nconsultants, and relevant stakeholders. In particular, the deliverables required of the consultants \nwill undergo substantive and timely review by Tonga\u2019s development partners, including AusAID, \nNZAID, and PFTAC/IMF. Detailed reporting requirements are outlined in Appendix 3. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $510,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tonga for Support for the Implementation of the Strategic Development Plan \n2006/07\u20132008/09, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact    Assumption \nImprove economic and  \u2022  SDP-8 substantially  \u2022 Progress reports by  \u2022 Continued political support \npublic sector  implemented  steering committee  for the implementation of \nmanagement in Tonga by  \u2022  Macroeconomic  SDP-8, particularly for the \nensuring that the  indicators agreed upon  \u2022 Official statistical indicators   program of economic and \nGovernment is able to  under EPSRP II    public sector reforms \nalign its policies,   \nstrategies, expenditures  Risks \nand work program with  \u2022 Opposition from public \nSDP-8  service organizations to \n  changes proposed by the \n  program \n \n\u2022 Financial crisis that distracts \nthe Government from reform \nefforts \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nGovernment decision  \u2022 Designed action plans  \u2022 Steering committee  \u2022 Continued political support \nmaking\u2013particularly on  fully endorsed by the  progress reports   for the program of economic \nbudgeting\u2013consistent with  Government  \u2022 Diagnostic and survey  and public sector reforms \nSDP-8 priorities  \u2022 Recommended  studies vetted by \npolicies and  development partners,  Risks \nmeasures accepted  government agencies, and  \u2022 Opposition from public \nand endorsed by  civil society organizations  service organizations to \nstakeholders    changes proposed by the \n\u2022 Strengthened  program \nsupport of the   \nstakeholder  \u2022 Financial crisis that distracts \ncommunity for the  the Government from reform \nSDP-8  efforts \nimplementation   \nprocess \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \nReports and action  \u2022  Submission of  \u2022 TA progress reports  \u2022 Availability of qualified \nplans to assist the  inception, midterm, and  \u2022 Staff review reports  consultants familiar with \nGovernment in  draft final and final  \u2022 Workshop participant  economic and public reforms  \nimplementing SDP-8,  reports, including a  feedback   \nespecially with  sector analysis,    \u2022 Selection and availability of \neconomic and public  development partner    workshop participants who \nsector management   coordination matrix,  are relevant and resourceful \n  summary poverty   \nA program of  reduction and social  \u2022 Capable counterpart staff \ncommunity consultation  strategy, and summary   \nand participation  poverty impact  Risk \nactivities related with  assessment of the  \u2022 Unavailability of senior \nimplementation of  proposed program  government officials for \nSDP-8    discussion and/or specific \n  information \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7\nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \n  \u2022  Consultative     \nworkshops with \nstakeholders on the \nimpact of the proposed \nprogram on economic \nand public sector \nmanagement \n\u2022  Reports on the results \nof the workshops and \nfeedback from \nparticipants \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.

Objectives \n1.  The overall goal of the technical assistance (TA) is to improve economic and public \nsector management in Tonga by ensuring that the Government is able to align its policies, \nstrategies, expenditures, and work program with Strategic Development Plan Eight (SDP-8), \nincluding recommending policies and measures for development partners\u2019 assistance to the \nGovernment. Appropriate capacity building will therefore be required to ensure sustainable \nmanagement of SDP-8 implementation. The expected TA outcome is that Government decision \nmaking\u2013\u2013particularly  on  budgeting\u2013\u2013will  be  consistent  with  SDP-8  priorities,  Government \nagencies\u2019  will  be  more  cost-effective  through  a  better  focus  on  service  delivery,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  partners  will  have  greater  confidence  that  their  support  is \nappropriately targeted. The expected TA outputs are reports to assist the Government in \nimplementing  SDP-8\u2013\u2013especially  with  economic  and  public  sector  management;  and  a \nprogram  of  community  consultation  and  participation  activities  to  help  ensure  that  SDP-8 \nimplementation is aligned with the aspirations that these stakeholders have expressed during \nthe development of SDP-8. General aims of the policy measures and action programs that will \nfocus on the governance environment, macroeconomic stability, private sector-led development \nand  pro-poor  policies are  to  (i)  improve  the  Government\u2019s  cost-effectiveness  in  achieving \ndevelopment  results;  (ii)  mitigate  negative  social  risks  of  the  reforms;  and  (iii)  conduct \nmeaningful  policy  dialogue  in  a  coordinated  and  comprehensive  manner,  within  the \nGovernment  and  with  the  stakeholders,  including  Tonga\u2019s  development  partners.
