THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  5 \n ", "", " \n \nI.  THE ONGOING PROGRAM \n \n1.  ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program (TFP) fills market gaps by providing guarantees and loans \nto partner banks in support of trade. Since 2009, TFP has supported more than 12,000 small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across developing Asia and the Pacific \u2013 through over 16,500 \ntransactions valued at over $30 billion \u2013 in sectors ranging from commodities and capital goods, \nto medical supplies and consumer goods. In 2017, the TFP supported $4.5 billion in trade through \napproximately  3,500  transactions.  The  TFP  also  encourages  commercial  sustainability  by \npromoting environmental and social safeguards standards, ensuring integrity and transparency, \nas  well  as  helping  accelerate  progress  in gender  equality.  TFP  is  also  supporting  digital \ntransformation as it pertains to trade finance. \n  \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Trade finance is explicitly recognized in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for \nDevelopment as an important means of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs).1 However, an ADB survey published in September 2017 estimated a global trade finance \ngap of $1.5 trillion, 40% of which is in Asia and the Pacific, with 74% of rejected trade finance \ntransactions coming from SMEs. Private sector funding and support is critical to address the large \nmarket gaps for short-term trade finance that exists across Asia and the Pacific.2 Thus, to address \nsuch market deficiencies, ADB, in accordance with Strategy 2030, will expand the use and reach \nof its various financial sector programs such as trade finance and supply chain finance.3  \n \n3.  The proposed $3.0 million technical assistance (TA)4 will help TFP to continue to address \nmarket gaps for trade finance and therefore support more trade by building on the initiatives \nstarted under previous TFP TAs and introduce new initiatives.5 The TA will provide TFP with funds \nto engage consultants over the next three years to assist in various capacity building initiatives \nfor  enhanced  safeguards,  integrity  due  diligence  related  to  combatting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, gender/disability policies, and digitization of trade \nfinance in TFP partner banks. The TA will also fund related knowledge-sharing and partnership \nactivities. These will include seminars and regional trainings for developing member country \n(DMC) banks, their SME clients, and related government agencies.   \n \n4.  Safeguards Initiative. The TA will create awareness of and help address social and \nenvironmental issues such as child/forced labor, climate change and sustainability through the \nbanking sector, which is expected to also impact banks\u2019 clients, including SMEs. The effects of \nthese various social and environmental safeguards issues are seen globally, but much more so \nin developing countries where it inflicts the most economic and social costs. Many DMCs where \nTFP operates are considered climate-vulnerable because of the importance of climate-sensitive \nsectors in their economies (i.e. agriculture) and because of limited resource capacity to respond \n                                                \n1 United Nations. 2015.

Deepening financial institutions\u2019 awareness and understanding of environmental and \nsocial safeguards through formulating safeguards guidelines and conducting safeguards due \ndiligence as well as trainings and workshops is expected to result in enhanced safeguards \ncapacity within TFP and its partner banks and may also result in safeguards improvements \nbeyond the scope of banks\u2019 trade finance business such as in terms of accessing direct debt or \nequity finance opportunities from ADB.  Enhanced safeguards capacity is also expected to \ntranslate into increased support for trade, for example, of agricultural commodities into DMCs that \nmay be affected by climate change-related events (i.e., severe flooding), enabling DMCs to \nbecome more resilient to direct and indirect impacts of climate change. \n \n6.  Anticorruption and Integrity Measures. Following the global financial crisis, compliance \nand regulatory requirements have increased significantly for banks, including in trade finance. \nConsequently, \u2018de-risking\u2019 of correspondent banking relationships is affecting trade in DMCs. TFP \npartner  banks,  including  those  in  the  Pacific,  are  witnessing  a  decline  in  correspondent \nrelationships to clear transactions and/or issue trade finance instruments. Trade for these banks \nis dampened and therefore overall economic growth and job creation will slow.  In an extreme \nscenario, de-risking could isolate countries from the global financial and trading system.   Part of \nthe  problem  cited  by  financial  institutions  and  DMCs  alike  is  the  different  definitions  and \ntreatments by financial regulators on how to comply with anti-financial crimes and integrity due \ndiligence and regulations.  Correspondent banks note that varying compliance requirements can \nadd  costs  and  risks  to  on-boarding  and  maintaining  correspondent  banking  relationships, \nespecially in DMCs. The TA will support strengthening of practices related to combating corruption, \nmoney laundering, and the financing of terrorism measures.  It will also improve monitoring of \nsuch issues by conducting integrity due diligence reviews on all TFP partner banks and financial \ninstitutions. \n \n7.  The TA will also complement the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the \nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) and align with the efforts of numerous industry bodies in this \narea by further analyzing the development of a scorecard to assess the implementation and \neffectiveness of global regulations with respect to anti-money laundering and combating terrorism \nfinancing regulations, and then support follow-on initiatives. It is anticipated that this initiative will \nencourage greater harmonization between regulatory jurisdictions, clarify, simplify and reduce \ncosts of compliance and therefore mitigate the problems associated with de-risking. \n \n8.  Gender Equity and Inclusive Initiatives. Gender equity initiatives will continue to be \nimplemented and the program will set a minimum threshold of 30% for the percentage of female \nparticipants in any TFP training. In 2016, the TFP launched a gender initiative aimed at attracting, \nretaining, and promoting women in banking and trade. To date, the human resource policies of \n20 TFP partner banks have been assessed for possible human resource policy enhancements. \nConsultants will be engaged under the TA to implement recommendations and future phases of \nthis initiative following results of the TFP gender study published in May 2018.6 This may also \ninclude social protection elements such as establishing disability-friendly facilities in the workplace \nand ensuring gender-inclusiveness in the banks\u2019 human resource policies. \n \n9.  Digitization of Trade. While there is intense discussion around and promotion of the \ndigitization of trade and fintech\u2019s ability to close market gaps and deliver on the \u2018inclusive economy\u2019 \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "    3 \nagenda, basic rules, standards, protocols and best practices need to be introduced to support \ngrowth and innovation. The TA will support an initiative (\u201cDigital Standards in Trade (DST)\u201d or the \n\u201cUniversal Trade Network\u201d (UTN) or whatever name and structure may be determined most \nappropriate by the industry) with the private and public sectors on a cost-sharing basis to create \ndigital rules, standards, protocols and practices required to digitize trade, drive inter-operability \nand underpin progress in fintech to reduce financing gaps among SMEs and DMCs. DST/UTN \n(or by some other name) will coordinate with all stakeholders to create and drive global adoption \nof the standards and practices that will serve as basic infrastructure for the digitization of trade.  \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. Through TFP\u2019s gender equity and safeguards \ninitiatives, the TA supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities B, C and D with regard to \naccelerating gender equality, tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability, as well as building more livable cities by making them \nmore resilient and inclusive. The TA likewise incorporates guiding principles for ADB\u2019s operations \non promoting innovative technology and digital transformation by conducting pilot testing related \nto digitization of trade processes and documents. Moreover, the proposed capacity building and \nknowledge-sharing and collaboration activities under the TA demonstrates ADB\u2019s role as a \nknowledge institution and knowledge provider and promotes ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 key operational \npriorities F and G related to strengthening governance and institutional capacity and fostering \nregional cooperation and integration through trade. \n \nB.
