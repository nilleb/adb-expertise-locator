INTRODUCTION \n1.  Through South\u2013South cooperation and knowledge exchange, developing countries with \nextensive development experience and effective practices can contribute to the formulation of \nrelevant, effective, and efficient solutions to development challenges. The Busan Declaration of \n2011 recognized that \u201cSouth\u2013South and triangular co-operation have the potential to transform \ndeveloping countries\u2019 policies and approaches to service delivery by bringing effective, locally \nowned  solutions  that  are  appropriate  to  country  contexts.\u201d  It  further  encouraged  \u201cthe \ndevelopment of networks for knowledge exchange, peer learning and co-ordination among \nSouth\u2013South co-operation actors as a means of facilitating access to important knowledge \npools by developing countries.\u201d \n \n2.  To  promote  South\u2013South  cooperation, the Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic of \nChina (PRC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) established the Regional Knowledge \nSharing Initiative (RKSI) on 30 August 2012. The RKSI\u2014located at ADB\u2019s PRC resident mission \nin Beijing\u2014is mandated to foster South\u2013South knowledge sharing, which is intended to increase \ncollaboration among developing countries and promote regional cooperation and integration. \nThe RKSI provides a platform for knowledge exchange among ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries  (DMCs),  promotes  regional  knowledge  sharing  events  that  build  on  knowledge \npartnerships,  and  is  intended  to  serve  as  catalyst  for  sharing  knowledge  generated  by \ndeveloping countries.  \n \n3.  The technical assistance (TA) will support the identification, development, and sharing of \nknowledge solutions in DMCs consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and country partnership \nstrategies  (CPSs)  covering  the  DMCs  concerned.1 The  TA  will  work  closely  with  partner \ninstitutions in the PRC and other DMCs, with ADB as a knowledge intermediary. \n \n4.  The TA will be implemented through the RKSI and will facilitate the development of \nknowledge  sharing  events  with  key  partner  institutions  in  the  PRC  and  other  DMCs;  the \nproduction  of  high-quality  knowledge  products;  and  the  strengthening  and  expansion  of \nknowledge sharing networks and partnerships among key DMC institutions.2 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n5.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 highlights knowledge solutions as one of the five drivers for change \nthat will propel development in Asia and the Pacific. Knowledge solutions are identified in \nnumerous CPSs as a driver of change in individual DMCs. For example, the PRC CPS for \n2011\u20132015 highlights the role that knowledge sharing can play by developing and promoting \nbest practices and scaling up demonstration projects.3 Successful development solutions in one \ncountry can be highly applicable in another. \n \n6.  ADB is supporting knowledge sharing by developing platforms for knowledge exchange \nin  key  sectors  and  thematic  areas.  Knowledge  cooperation  is  being  developed  by  both \noperational departments and specialized knowledge departments. For example, in May 2012, a \nKnowledge Sharing and Services Center was established in the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department to connect and coordinate the different knowledge sharing platforms.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 July 2013. \n3  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n7.  In ADB\u2019s operational departments, knowledge management has become an integral part \nof both country-level operations and regional cooperation and integration. In middle-income \ncountries in particular, there is an increased emphasis on generating knowledge from loan and \nTA operations and sharing this knowledge with other DMCs. Drawing knowledge solutions from \nADB operations helps to ensure their practical relevance.   \n \n8.  There are numerous internationally competitive universities and think tanks in the region, \nand  ADB  is  working  with  many  of  them  through  TA  grants,  loan  projects,  and  capacity \ndevelopment programs. In some DMCs, ADB has established dedicated knowledge hubs or \nknowledge partnerships based on specific sectors and themes. Some knowledge partnerships \nare project-based and designed to deliver a specific knowledge product, while others have been \ninitiated to support knowledge generation more broadly. For example, in the PRC, the Urban \nKnowledge Hub, which was established in March 2010 with Tongji University in Shanghai, is \nsharing best practice approaches in urban planning. Knowledge hubs provide a venue for \nregular knowledge exchange, serve as an entry point for identifying resource persons and \nconsultants, and assist in generating knowledge solutions and new project ideas.             \n \n9.  The RKSI builds on previous knowledge cooperation between ADB and the PRC to \nfurther  develop  South\u2013South  knowledge  sharing.4 The  annual  event  under  the  ADB\u2013PRC \nknowledge sharing platform is now coordinated  through the RKSI. The RKSI is based on \ntriangular cooperation that promotes South\u2013South cooperation through mutual learning and the \nsharing of development experiences between the PRC and other DMCs, with ADB playing an \nintermediary role.5  \n \n10.  The  RKSI  is  intended  to  (i)  organize  and  co-partner  demand-based  international \nknowledge  sharing  events;  (ii)  produce  knowledge  products  based  on  these  events;  and \n(iii) strengthen existing knowledge networks, assist in forming new ones, and assist\u2014together \nwith other ADB departments\u2014in linking with other ADB-wide knowledge partnerships. The RKSI \noperates in close collaboration with ADB regional cooperation initiatives such as the Greater \nMekong Subregion and Central Asia Regional economic cooperation programs.  \n \n11.  For knowledge cooperation to be effective, it is essential to work closely with local \ninstitutions in DMCs. The RKSI was established in the PRC resident mission so that it could \nwork  closely  with  local  institutions,  cooperate  with  these  institutions  in  building  up  their \nknowledge sharing programs, and assist these institutions in building up their networking and \npartnerships with knowledge institutions in other DMCs. The RKSI will help initiate or build up \nthese partnerships, which are expected to become self-sustaining in the longer term.  \n \n                                                \n4  Previous knowledge sharing was carried out under the ADB\u2013PRC knowledge sharing platform. Events organized \nunder  the  platform  included  \u201cSustainable  Urbanization,\u201d  Shanghai,  PRC,  2\u20136  November  2009;  \u201cTransport \nInfrastructure:  An  Instrument  for  Economic  and  Social  Development,\u201d  Beijing,  PRC,  8\u201311  November  2010; \n\u201cAgricultural and Rural Development: Improving Farm Productivity and Rural Livelihoods,\u201d Beijing, PRC, 8\u201311 \nNovember 2011; and \u201cSouth\u2013South Knowledge Cooperation,\u201d Manila, Philippines, 13 September 2012. \n5  Triangular cooperation is a collaboration between a developing or \u201csouthern\u201d (sometimes called pivotal) provider \nand a developed country or multilateral organization for the benefit of a third receiving country or group of \ncountries. A common feature is that know-how, skills, experiences, and resources from North and South are \ncombined. \n \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  strengthened  and  sustained  knowledge  sharing  and \ncooperation among the PRC and other DMCs through triangular cooperation. The outcome of \nthe TA will be the strengthened capacity of key institutions and knowledge networks in the PRC \nand other DMCs to address emerging issues and challenges in the region effectively through \nknowledge sharing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  TA  will  work  through  key  knowledge  institutions  in  the  PRC  and  their  partner \ninstitutions in other DMCs to enhance the development and use of knowledge solutions. The \nRKSI has a coordination  role to facilitate knowledge sharing  with and among ADB\u2019s PRC \nknowledge partnerships and knowledge hubs, and is currently working closely with the Asia-\nPacific Finance and Development Center, International Poverty Reduction Center for China, \nMinistry  of  Environmental  Protection,  Urban  Knowledge  Hub  at  Tongji  University,  and \nInternational Enterprise Singapore to develop international knowledge sharing events.  \n \n14.  The business model of the TA and of the RKSI more broadly, is to serve as a catalyst for \npromoting knowledge sharing in the region, particularly the development of knowledge sharing \nnetworks. The TA will support the RKSI in establishing initial knowledge sharing activities with \nthe aforementioned partner institutions in the PRC, and in building up cooperation between \nthese institutions, with partner institutions in other DMCs, and with other development partners. \nIn the initial phase, as supported by the TA, the RKSI will provide catalytic and co-financial \nsupport for knowledge sharing activities jointly organized by institutions in the PRC and other \nDMCs. Subsequently, financial support from the RKSI would be supplemented or replaced by \nfinancing from the partner institutions and/or from other development partners.  \n    \n15.  The outputs of the TA will include (i) international knowledge sharing workshops, (ii) \nknowledge products, (iii) networks that foster mutual learning  through the sharing of good \npractices  and  lessons  learned from  the  PRC and  other  DMCs,  (iv)  a  website to  enhance \ninteraction and knowledge sharing, and (v) development of the RKSI strategy and medium-term \nworkplan.  The  workshops  will  produce  knowledge  products,  including  background/seminar \npapers,  workshop  proceedings,  related  brochures,  and  multi-language  video  clips  on  key \nknowledge solutions.  \n \n16.  Output 1: International knowledge sharing workshops completed. A minimum of \nfour demand-based international knowledge sharing workshops will be implemented in 2013 \nand  2014.  In  each  workshop,  key  practitioners  and  decision  makers  will  discuss  selected \nknowledge solutions, which will be followed by an international array of discussants exploring \nlinkages to their respective countries. There will be a strong focus on adapting and replicating \nknowledge  solutions  from  other  countries.  The  knowledge  sharing  workshops  will  be  built \naround existing partnerships in the PRC, and they will subsequently expand to include partner \ninstitutions in other DMCs. The TA will primarily provide support for resource persons and \ninternational participants. \n \n17.  Output 2: Knowledge products produced and disseminated. Each workshop will \nproduce knowledge products, including workshop papers, workshop proceedings and other \npublications, and multi-language video clips. As part of the workshops exhibitions and related \n ", "4   \nbrochures may also be developed. The TA will support the development, production, translation, \nand dissemination of high-quality knowledge products to ensure broad access to participants \nfrom different DMCs.    \n  \n18.  Output 3: Networks that foster mutual learning strengthened and expanded. The \nTA will help key institutions expand institutional knowledge partnerships, linking them with each \nother to build on synergies in knowledge sharing.6 Many DMC institutions have strong networks \nwith domestic institutions, but limited international contacts with institutions in other DMCs. The \nTA, through knowledge sharing activities and support from ADB, which has many existing \npartnerships throughout  the region,  will  help  partner  institutions  build up  their  international \nnetworks.   \n \n19.  Output 4: RKSI website developed. The TA will develop an RKSI website based on a \nwebsite business plan closely developed with ADB\u2019s Department of External Relations. The \nwebsite will serve as a depository of knowledge products of RKSI events and related South\u2013\nSouth knowledge products and networks. The website will also contain interactive elements to \nallow for broad-based interaction with knowledge partners and stakeholders. \n \n20.  Output 5: RKSI strategy and medium-term workplan developed. The TA will support \nthe development of the RKSI strategy and the medium-term workplan based on the evaluation \nof the first 15 months of RKSI operations.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The Government of the PRC endorsed financing of the TA on 20 June \n2013 and may consider further financing in subsequent years. The Government of the PRC will \nprovide  in-kind  contributions,  including  counterpart  staff,  and  other  participating  DMCs  will \nprovide various counterpart activities and support for the organization of knowledge sharing \nactivities.  Events  will  be  further  leveraged  by  other  ADB  resources  or  by  cofinancing \narrangements. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB will be the executing agency, with the East Asia Department as the focal point. The \nRKSI will coordinate and work closely with other ADB regional and specialized knowledge \ndepartments,  and  it  will  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the  fund.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented between 26 August 2013 and 25 March 2015. \n \n23.  The  TA  will  engage  individual  international  consultants  for  10  person-months  and \nindividual  national  consultants  for  8  person-months.  ADB  will  recruit  the  consultants  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA will also finance regional knowledge sharing activities, including resource persons, \ninternational participants, and the preparation and finalization of knowledge products developed \nin connection with these events. All procurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). After implementation \nof the TA, all procured items will remain with the executing agency. The TA will be disbursed in \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2011.
