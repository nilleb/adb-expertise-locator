I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant to \nNepal for the Capital Market and Infrastructure Capacity Support Project. The project aims to \naddress  key  impediments  to  infrastructure  development  in  Nepal  through  the  creation  of  an \nenabling  environment  for  the  generation  of  long-term  financing  and  active  private  sector \nparticipation (PSP) in infrastructure. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Nepal is in the process of reconciliation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction after its decade-\nlong  conflict.  Key  stakeholders  reached  a  comprehensive  peace  agreement  in  2006,  and \nsuccessfully held constituent assembly elections in 2008. The macroeconomic environment has \nimproved and gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 3.5% in FY2010. The restoration of peace \naugurs well for the revival of the country\u2019s development and poverty reduction agenda. However, \nthe post-conflict political transition has been complex and challenging, with a protracted peace and \nconstitution drafting process.  \n3.  Nepal faces continuing, daunting development challenges across all sectors. Poverty is still \nwidespread in the country and economic growth remains uneven. Poor infrastructure is a critical \nconstraint  to  inclusive  economic  growth  in  Nepal.  The  infrastructure  sector  is  grossly \nunderdeveloped, with large sections of the population lacking access to basic services. More than \n18 million people are still without access to electricity, mainly in the rural areas and remote \ndistricts.1 The  persistent  energy  shortages  disrupt  economic  activity  and  impose  hardship, \nespecially  on  the  poor.  Poor  physical  connectivity,  resulting  from  underinvestment  in  roads, \nsignificantly increases costs of production and trade as well as access to basic social services.  \n \n4.  Nepal needs to invest an estimated $40 billion in infrastructure for 2009\u20132025 to achieve its \ntarget  GDP  growth  rate  of  7%.2 Investment  requirements  have  risen  rapidly  due  to  delayed \ninvestment and damage to infrastructure during the conflict.3  Nepal spends less than 1% of total \nGDP  on  infrastructure,  which  is  significantly  less  than  other  countries  in  the  region.4 Public \nfinancing is already constrained by the high cost of post-conflict reconstruction efforts and limited \nfiscal space, and cannot generate the needed level of infrastructure investment. Private sector \ninvestment is needed to bridge the infrastructure financing gap critical to Nepal's development and \npoverty-reduction efforts, but PSP in infrastructure in Nepal has been low due to the lack of an \nenabling environment to attract larger investments in this sector. \n5.  Initial  efforts  by  the  Government  of  Nepal  to  introduce  policies  and  incentives  for \ninfrastructure  financing  have  been  ad  hoc  and  fragmented.  Infrastructure  financing  in  Nepal \nremains impeded by multiple and interlocking constraints resulting from the (i) absence of a well-\n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank, Department for International Development, and International Labour Organization. 2009. \nCountry Diagnostic Studies. Nepal: Critical Development Constraints. Manila. \n2  The 7% desired rate of growth was specified in the Brussels Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries (an \noutcome of the Brussels Declaration in May 2001), and will help Nepal meet its Millennium Development Goals. \nFeedback Ventures. 2008. Feasibility Study and Business Plan for Setting Up an Infrastructure Financing Institution in \nNepal. Kathmandu (August). \n3  It is estimated that $129.6 million worth of physical infrastructure was damaged during the conflict in Nepal. (Footnote \n1). \n4  India spent roughly 4.8% of total GDP on infrastructure in 2007 and 2008. It is estimated that South Asian countries \nneed an annual investment in key infrastructure subsectors of about 6%\u20137% of their GDP to achieve their growth \ntargets. (http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=22513) ", " 2 \ndeveloped capital market for raising long-term funds, such as bond and equity financing; (ii)  \ninadequate policy and regulatory framework, which is not conducive to PSP in infrastructure; and \n(iii) lack of viable projects and capacity for project structuring to attract private sector investments. \nThe challenging political transition5 has an adverse impact on investor sentiment that exacerbates \nthese constraints. \n6.  The current political uncertainty and subdued investment climate augurs in favor of an \nincremental approach to capital market development in Nepal, and in the absence of any major \npolicy reforms, any intervention supporting capital market development must build on tangible, \npiecemeal achievements. \n \n7.  Underdeveloped bond market. Long-term committed funding for infrastructure projects is \nbest  supported  by  a  mature  and  vibrant  bond  market,  but  Nepal's  bond  market  remains \nconstrained, accounting for just 12.6% of GDP at the end of 2009. The government issues most \n(90%) of Nepal\u2019s debt securities, in the form of treasury bills and bonds which are largely held to \nmaturity. There is no coherent public debt management strategy to guide decisions on the volume \nand maturity of each issuance, which are done on an ad hoc basis, primarily to meet short-term \nfinancing needs.  From a macroeconomic perspective, additional effort is required to strengthen \neconomic fundamentals to develop a low inflation and stable interest rate environment. \n8.  The Nepalese institutional investor base is too narrow to support an active bond market. \nCommercial banks are the largest investors in government securities, and invest mainly to meet \nstatutory liquidity requirements. Having primary dealers serve as agents for the sale of government \nsecurities can contribute significantly to trading of these securities in the secondary market, but \nsuch a provision and practice does not exist in Nepal. Secondary trading is negligible due to the \nlack of investor base and inadequate clearing and settlement systems. Processing of information \ntakes 10\u201315 days and securities are issued in paper form, which is subject to human error and \nfraud.   \n9.  The lack of a reliable issuance calendar, minimal government securities, trading volume, \nand negligible liquidity in the secondary market all contribute to the lack of a liquid sovereign \nbenchmark yield curve that is essential for pricing corporate bonds and long-term debt financing \ninstruments. Moreover, the absence of a credit rating agency in the country limits the ability of \ninvestors to make informed investment decisions. Consequently, corporate bond market activity is \nalmost non-existent. \n10.  Attention needs to be given to improve the laws, regulations, and supervision for bond \nmarket development. Nepal\u2019s financial regulators, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and the Securities \nBoard  of  Nepal  (SEBON),  have  overlapping  roles  in  securities  market  regulation.  While  the \nSecurities  Related  Act,  2007,  provides  the  legal  basis  for  SEBON,  it  provides  inadequate \nindependence and enforcement powers; when coupled with SEBON\u2019s capacity constraints, this \nrenders it unable to effectively fulfill its market development and regulation mandates. \n11.  Weak policy and institutional frameworks. The government is undertaking initiatives, \nwith support from Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners, to promote \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in various infrastructure subsectors.6 However, both public and \nprivate  sectors  share  the  view  that  a  robust  regime  of  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory \n                                                 \n5  The constituent assembly\u2019s extended tenure ends May 2011. A new government under Prime Minister Jhala Nath \n  Khanal was sworn in on 6 February 2011. The political situation can be expected to remain uncertain for some time as \n  concluding the ongoing peace process remains challenging.   \n6  Summary of Ongoing ADB Technical Assistance on Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Nepal (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "  3\nframeworks conducive for investment in infrastructure sector in Nepal is absent. There is no central \napex body to formulate PPP policies and national strategies. The project pipeline suitable for PPPs \nremains thin, and while a number of line ministries are pursuing various PPP projects, they are \ndoing so without a uniform approach, and none of the projects have reached successful financial \nclosure to date. Key constraints include the (i) absence of a national PPP policy framework, \n(ii) weaknesses  in  key  policies  and  legislation,7 (iii)  lack  of  information  and  guidelines  on \nappropriate risk-sharing mechanisms between public and private sectors needed to support PSP, \nand (iv) lack of reliable independent dispute resolution system. \n12.  Lack of PPP experience and capacity. Project financing and PPPs are relatively new \nconcepts in Nepal. At present, key line ministries (e.g., the Ministry of Physical Planning and \nWorks, Ministry of Energy, and Ministry of Local Development) are pursuing PPP ventures, but lack \na uniform approach. Understanding of PPPs and how they can be used to spearhead infrastructure \ndevelopment interventions in various sectors is limited. PPP projects are being initiated by some \nline ministries, but to date none have attracted private sector interest. Commercial banks and \npublic sector entities in Nepal lack the technical and commercial skills needed to identify, appraise, \nand structure projects, even if suitable infrastructure lending was available. \n13.  Opportunities. Accelerated economic growth supported by high quality infrastructure is a \ncritical priority of the government\u2019s Three-Year Interim Plan, FY2008\u2013FY2010, and the Three-Year \nPlan Approach Paper, FY2011\u2013FY2013.8 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132012,9 and the \n2009 country assistance program evaluation10 for Nepal are closely aligned with the government\u2019s \ndevelopment plans, and highlight the importance of infrastructure in Nepal's development and \npoverty reduction efforts. However, the interim plan concluded without demonstrable progress \nagainst its infrastructure goals, and economic development in Nepal remains slow. The interim \nplan,  the  approach  paper,  and  the  country  partnership  strategy  all  recognize  the  need  for \ninnovation and diversification in Nepal\u2019s financial sector11 in order to promote much-needed private \nsector  investment  in  infrastructure  development.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation \nrecommends prioritizing assistance to infrastructure, including through a longer-term approach that \npromotes private sector investments and PPPs.  \n14.  Opportunities for capital market development and infrastructure financing are included in \nthe measures initiated by the government in support of the interim plan and the approach paper \npriorities, which include: \n(i)  undertaking  a  feasibility  study  for  the  establishment  of  an  independent  debt \nmanagement office, separate from the monetary functions of the central bank;12 \n(ii)  establishing a central depository system for both bonds and equities, with support \nfrom the Government of India;13 and \n                                                 \n7  Including for example, amendments to the Private Financing in Build and Operation of Infrastructures Act, 2006 \n(commonly referred to in Nepal as the BOOT Act). \n8  Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2007.

At present, the NRB is the debt manager for the government. It is also the \nregulator of government securities market and advises the government on the formulation of annual borrowing \nprogram. As the debt manager for the government, the NRB manages the maturity profile, timing of issue, composition \nof debt, and type of instruments issued.  \n ", " 4 \n(iii)  establishing PPP cells in some line ministries for project-specific transactions, and \nprioritizing PPPs in its development strategies. \n15.  Lessons. Lessons from ADB experience have been incorporated in the project design. A \nrecent special evaluation study14 of ADB support for capital market development noted the need to \ndevelop realistic assistance strategies that take into account country-specific conditions. Given \nNepal\u2019s political uncertainty and the limited absorptive capacity and resources of public institutions, \ndevelopment interventions must be modest and realistic building on incremental achievements. \nNepal\u2019s capital market is in a nascent state and sector institutions are weak; consequently, the \nproject focuses on fundamental aspects of financial sector development and PSP (i.e., developing \nthe basic regulatory and institutional framework and market infrastructure). The project places a \nstrong  emphasis  on  basic  but  key  aspects  of  capacity  development  that  will  ensure  the \nsustainability of reforms essential for further sector development. The project builds on past ADB \nsupport (i.e., the Corporate and Financial Governance Project),15 which helped develop the basic \nbuilding  blocks  by  supporting  (i)  the  development  of  key  financial  sector  legislation,  (ii) \nestablishment of public sector accounting and auditing standards, and (iii) improvement of legal \nenforcement capacity and infrastructure. The project design also benefited from past technical \nassistance on public debt management16 and ongoing technical assistance projects for PPPs \n(footnote 6).  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n16.  The impact will be greater availability of infrastructure services. The outcome will be greater \nprivate sector investment in the infrastructure sector. (Appendix 1) \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  Nepal needs to address prevailing inadequacies in the financial and infrastructure sectors \nwhile also progressing the infrastructure development agenda. The three project outputs aim to \nbridge the significant and growing gaps in infrastructure financing. \n18.  Output  1:  Regulatory  and  institutional  framework  for  bond  market  development. \nGiven the lack of bond market development in Nepal, there is a need to first create an enabling \nenvironment for the successful development of government securities market that will set the stage \nfor development of corporate debt securities.  \n(i)  Strengthening the institutional capacity for public debt management. This will \nbe achieved through (a) developing an effective institutional arrangement for debt \nmanagement; (b) drafting appropriate regulations for establishing a dedicated and \nprofessionally  managed  Public  Debt  Management  Office  (PDMO);  (c)  installing \nappropriate  information  technology  platforms  and  analytical  tools,  including \nmaintenance  and  updates  of  the  computer-based  debt  management  system; \n(d) implementing training programs, including links with debt management entities \n                                                 \n13 As part of the technical assistance agreement (signed in January 2010) between the Central Depository Services \n(India) Limited (CDSL) and Nepal Stock Exchange Limited, CDSL will also provide support for (i) finalizing operating \ninstructions; (ii) preparing business requirement specifications, evaluation and selection of vendors for hardware and \nnetworking; and (iii) carrying out User Acceptance Training for the implementation of the central depository system. \n14  ADB. 2008.

As \npart  of  its  efforts  to  establish  the  PDMO,  the  proposed  project  will  assist  in \nestablishing  a  sovereign  yield  curve  as  a  benchmark  for  pricing  private  sector \nborrowings by (a) helping develop a reliable issuance calendar that specifies the \nvolume  and  maturity  of  government  securities  by  the  PDMO;  and  (b)  helping \nestablish a primary dealer system by enforcing a licensing requirement, developing \na code of conduct for primary dealers, and developing a system of incentives for \nprimary dealers to play a market-making role. \n(iii)  Developing  the  bond  market  infrastructure.  A  central  depository  system  is \ncurrently being developed (footnote 13); however, further support will be needed to \ndraft necessary components for the establishment of a legal framework for the \nsystem. \n(iv)  Building the institutional and regulatory capacity of SEBON. To enhance the \nautonomy, enforcement powers, and capacity of SEBON, the project will (a) draft \nrelevant regulations and amendments to key regulations, including developing best \nregional practice governance norms for listed companies; and (b) implement in-\ncountry capacity-building programs for SEBON and the Nepal Stock Exchange, and \nbuild links with good-practice regulatory and training institutions and other relevant \nagencies. \n19.  Output  2:  Enabling  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  greater  private  sector \nparticipation  in  infrastructure.  This  component  continues  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  to  the \ngovernment for creation of an enabling PPP policy framework, including the inputs provided for \nstrengthening the draft report on the Nepal PPP White Paper 2010.17 The project will support \nestablishing and institutionalizing a central PPP cell within the National Planning Commission and \nprovide  capacity  building  for  (i)  developing  a  comprehensive  national  PPP  policy  framework \noutlining the government's policies, strategies, and approach to mainstreaming PPPs across line \nministries; (ii) conducting an inventory and suitability assessment of laws and regulations for \nenabling  PPP  transactions,  and  providing  recommendations  for  amendments,  revisions,  or \nadditions to such laws and regulations; (iii) developing PPP manuals and a process handbook, \nincluding  an  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards  framework;  (iv)  building  the \noperational  and  information  technology  capacity  of  the  central  PPP  cell;  (v)  developing  a \ncoordination mechanism with each line ministry PPP cell; and (vi) implementing PPP training \nprograms with links to PPP training institutes (e.g., in India and the Republic of Korea).  \n20.  Output 3: Development of a public\u2013private partnership demonstration project. The \nproject will provide technical support to the government in identifying and developing a pilot PPP \nproject (prioritizing a potential project of modest scope and complexity) from conceptualization to \nbid  stage,  including  by  (i)  identifying,  screening,  and  short-listing  appropriate  candidate  PPP \nprojects; (ii) undertaking pre-feasibility assessment of the candidate project based on a set of \nagreed criteria; (iii) selecting a demonstration project based on priorities and cost allocation; (iv) \nconducting a feasibility study (including financial, technical, and commercial structuring of the \n                                                 \n17  In December 2010, the ADB project team reviewed and provided extensive comments on the draft report on the Nepal \nPPP White Paper 2010, which was prepared by a consulting team supported by UNDP and submitted to the National \nPlanning Commission for its approval (ADB Preliminary Comments on the Draft Report on Nepal Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships White Paper 2010, accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " 6 \nselected demonstration project); (v) conducting stakeholder consultations; (vi) preparing project \ndocuments and contracts; and (vi) preparing bid documents.  \n \nD.

By improving the availability and quality of infrastructure over the longer term, the project \nwill contribute directly to inclusive growth and poverty reduction in Nepal. Reduced costs and \nhigher profitability resulting from improved infrastructure will enhance private sector investment, \nand thereby expand employment opportunities. Improved transport connectivity and access to \nelectricity and urban services will boost economic activity and significantly improve quality of life, \nespecially for the poor, who are particularly impacted by the lack of infrastructure services.  \n \n26.  A significant increase in infrastructure outlay is warranted if Nepal is to meet its growth and \npoverty reduction targets. Due to limited fiscal space, public financing alone will not be able to \ngenerate the level of investment needed to improve infrastructure facilities.  Enhancing private \nsector infrastructure investments and minimizing the government's borrowing cost through the \n ", " 8 \nPDMO  will  create  fiscal  space  for  additional  social  infrastructure  investment.  The  project  is \ndesigned to promote the commercial viability of infrastructure projects by creating an enabling \nenvironment to support long-term financing for infrastructure projects, and promote greater PSP \nthrough a robust PPP policy framework and structured project development process. Further, the \nsupport for development of demonstration PPP projects will help to gradually overcome the lack of \nexperience and technical and commercial skills required for identifying, appraising, and structuring \nPPP projects. This will complement ADB efforts to promote PSP, including through PPPs in the \ntransport, urban, and energy sectors. \n \n27.  Through bond market development, the project will help increase the competitiveness, \nefficiency, and stability of Nepal\u2019s financial system by (i) reducing overreliance by the public and \ncorporate sectors on short-term bank loans and foreign borrowings by mitigating maturity and \ncurrency mismatches in their portfolios and thereby enhancing the stability of the financial system; \n(ii) enabling long-term capital for long-term investments and asset creation, such as infrastructure, \nto  be  raised  efficiently;  and  (iii)  facilitating  efficient  financing  of  the  government  budget  from \nnonbank sources and thereby improving risk management of public debt. The development of a \nbroad-based  financial  sector  through  capital  market  development  will  reduce  vulnerability  to \nfinancial crises, which often have significant adverse growth and poverty impacts. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  Project-specific governance risks have been analyzed by carrying out a governance risk \nassessment in line with the requirements of ADB's Second Governance and Anticorruption Action \nPlan.19 In recent years, the government has taken a number of initiatives to address corruption, \nincluding the Promoting Market Competition Act, 2006; Right to Information Act, 2007; Special \nCourt Act, 2002 (amended in 2007); and Anti-Money-Laundering Act, 2008. The government has \nalso passed the Public Procurement Act, 2007, and the Public Procurement Regulations, 2007; \nwhich  are  both  generally  acceptable  to  ADB  and  encompass  best  international  procurement \npractices. The government has also established a \u201cprocurement watchdog\u201d in the form of the \nPublic  Procurement  Monitoring  Office  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of \nMinisters.  Furthermore,  it  has  established  the  National  Vigilance  Centre  under  the  direct \nsupervision and control of the Prime Minister to control corruption through preventive measures. \nThe project support for bond market development, private infrastructure investments, and capacity \nbuilding will also enhance governance in the respective fields. Corruption risks in the project are \nnot expected to be severe.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, and discussed \nwith,  the  government  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.20  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  The project is classified as one of general intervention. It will help create an enabling \nenvironment\u2014policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional\u2014for  increased  investments  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment with an aim to attract private sector investments through PPPs. Development of \npriority infrastructure, such as hydropower, transport, and water supply will not only promote overall \neconomic growth (which is critical for poverty reduction) but will also help improve access to \neconomic and social services. Greater business opportunities from increased public and private \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila. The action plan focuses on risks in public \nfinancial management, procurement, and anticorruption (A Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan is accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  9\ninvestments will generate employment opportunities and contribute to poverty reduction, thereby \nbenefiting the poor, women, and excluded sections of the population.  \n \nD.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n31.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nimpact on indigenous peoples. Adverse impacts of the proposed policy and regulatory reform and \ncapacity building activities in the project are unlikely. However, although no direct environmental \nand resettlement implications are expected, there could be future impacts through the proposed \ndevelopment of PPP infrastructure projects. Consequently, the project will help the line ministries \nresponsible  for  the  development  of  the  selected  PPP  projects  (i)  address  the  potential \nenvironmental and resettlement issues arising from investments in the infrastructure projects in line \nwith the safeguard policies of ADB and the government; and (ii) internalize and streamline these \nissues in the project activities, particularly in the training programs, operational manuals, and \nbusiness plans.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  The overall implementation risk of the project is considered low if appropriate mitigation \nmeasures are in place. Although the ongoing political transition and associated instability are \napparent risks to reform and development in any sector, risks to this project are limited. All political \nparties in Nepal consider financial sector reforms and infrastructure development important to \nachieving growth and poverty reduction. The implementing agencies in the project are the MOF \nand the financial regulators (NRB and SEBON), and therefore there is significant government \nownership of, and commitment to, the project. ADB will engage with the government to ensure that \nits commitment to relevant reforms remains high. Other risks and their mitigating measures are \nsummarized in Table 4 and are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.21 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nKey Risks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak project implementation and the lack of  Project implementation oversight and coordination will be provided \ncoordination across relevant agencies.
