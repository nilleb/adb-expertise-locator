A rapidly expanding mining sector and improvements in the transportation network in \nMongolia create a potential high-risk environment for the spread of HIV. In 2006, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) signed a joint initiative1 to commit to reducing HIV vulnerabilities \nassociated with infrastructure projects. ADB has a strong commitment to expand its support on \nintegrating  HIV  prevention  interventions  into  infrastructure  projects.  In  October  2007, \nconsultation meetings with key stakeholders and partners were held to discuss the proposed \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for HIV/AIDS Prevention in ADB Infrastructure Projects and \nthe Mining Sector. ADB undertook TA fact-finding from 22 April to 6 May 2008 and reached \nagreement  with  the  Government  of  Mongolia  (the  Government)  regarding  the  TA  impact, \noutcome, outputs, terms of reference for consulting services, cost estimates, financing plan, and \ninstitutional and implementation arrangements.2 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  HIV Epidemic in Mongolia. The HIV epidemic is growing, risk factors are high, and \nmobility is becoming an important aspect of the epidemic. In 2005, more than half (51.3%) of \nmobile men had sex with casual partners.3 Mobile men were the least likely group to have ever \nbeen  tested  for  HIV  infection  and  to  know  the  test  results.  The  data  suggests  increased \nvulnerability to HIV infections among the mobile and migrant population. It also reveals that 36% \nof sex workers were diagnosed as having a sexually transmitted infection (STI), which was 16 \ntimes higher than that of low-risk women. The number of reported cases of STIs has increased, \nand accounts for more than 47% of all communicable disease infection in the country.4  \n \n3.  HIV and Mobility. The spread of HIV through major transport and infrastructure projects \nis well documented.5 Increases in HIV prevalence tend to be clustered along major transport \nroutes  and  cross-border  areas.  The  interaction  among  the  construction  workforce,  local \ncommunities, and sex workers can create a potentially high-risk environment for the spread of \nHIV infections through unprotected sex and/or injecting drug use. Mobile and migrant workers \nare at great risk of both contracting the HIV infection and bridging HIV transmission to the \ngeneral  population,  as  their  increased  disposable  income  attracts  commercial  sex \nestablishments and allows them to offer money, food, and clothing to rural women and girls in \nexchange for sexual favors. Increased risk behavior and the growing number of mobile and \nmigrant  workers  in  the  country  provide  an  ideal  environment  for  the  rapid  spread  of  HIV \ninfection.  \n \n4.  Infrastructure Development in Mongolia. In Mongolia, major investments in the road, \ntransport, and mining sectors are planned in coming years. ADB-financed infrastructure projects \ninclude the Western Regional Road Corridor Development Project \u2013 Phase I and the Regional \nRoad Development Project.6 According to the National Development Road Network Plan for \n                                                 \n1  ADB, African Development Bank, Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation, KfW, and World Bank. 2006.

Report and Recommendation of ", "2   \n2006\u20132016, more than 2,000 kilometers of road are planned to be constructed during 2008\u2013\n2012. Investment on road construction in Mongolia tripled in 2007,7 and the rapid development \nof regional roads is expected to continue in the coming decade. The mining sector in Mongolia \ncontinues to grow and is the major source of Government revenue, accounting for 58% of \nexport earnings. At present, nearly 50% of foreign workers in Mongolia work in the mining \nsector.8 The formal mining sector employs over 12,000 people and the informal mining sector \ninvolves many times this number. The construction and mining industries accounted for 10% of \nthe total labor force in 2006,9 and the figure is expected to be much higher in the coming years. \nAs a result, a large number of mobile and migrant workers are expected in the country. There is \nalmost no applicable prior experience of large-scale, project-related influx in Mongolia. Influx \npopulation is typically categorized into four socioeconomic groups: (i) returning family members \n(former  residents),  (ii)  project  workers  from  outside  areas,  (iii)  speculative  migrants  (job \nseekers), and (iv) service providers in the formal and informal sector. Each group will come with \nits own social risks requiring differentiated interventions.10  \n \n5.  Government  Commitment  to  Fighting  HIV/AIDS.  The  Government  has  shown \nincreasing political commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention and control. The National Committee on \nAIDS Prevention was re-established under the supervision of a deputy prime minister. The \nNational Strategy on HIV and AIDS Prevention (2006\u20132010) was developed in consultation with \nvarious  sectors.  Since  2005,  the  Mongolian  Employers'  Federation  (MONEF)11  has  been \nactively engaged in HIV/AIDS prevention in workplaces and is also a recipient of the Round 5 of \nthe Global Fund for HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In 2007, $3.4 million was made available for \nAIDS prevention and care activities by international donors and the Government, an increase of \n28% compared with 2006.12 The recent policy development confirms the strong government \ncommitment  and,  together  with  increased  private  sector  engagement,  creates  an  enabling \nenvironment to support an effective and sustained national response to HIV/AIDS. Discussions \nare under way to amend  the national HIV/AIDS strategy to include specific aspects on HIV and \nmobility, which are currently missing. \n \n6.  ADB and HIV/AIDS. In the Asia and Pacific region, ADB has been responding with \nsupport for HIV/AIDS projects since 1993. ADB\u2019s strategic direction identifies three priority areas \nfor action: (i) leadership support, (ii) capacity building, and (iii) targeted programs for vulnerable \nand high-risk groups. Support has been largely through TA grants focusing on cross-border risk \nfactors,  particularly  in  road  and  transport  projects,  and  also  on  regional  cooperation  and \nknowledge building. In 2006, ADB signed a joint initiative with Japan Bank for International \nCooperation,  African  Development  Bank,  UK  Department  for  International  Development, \nKreditanstalt  fuer  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  and  World  Bank  to  commit  to  reducing  HIV \nvulnerabilities associated with infrastructure projects. The recent review of ADB\u2019s assistance on \nHIV prevention in transport projects in the Greater Mekong Subregion highlights the importance \nof  institutionalizing  HIV  prevention  approaches  through  capacity  building  and  policy \ndevelopment and of building capacity for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems.   \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nthe  President  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  Mongolia  for  the  Regional  Road \nDevelopment Project.

ADB\u2019s Experience in HIV/AIDS in Mongolia. Since 2005, ADB has been providing \ntechnical assistance to the Government for awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking that may be associated with road construction and increased cross-border movement \nof the population through the TA of the Regional Road Development Project.13 Lessons learned \nfrom the TA of the Regional Road Development Project will be applied to and refined by the \nproposed TA. There is little activity among other donors for HIV prevention in conjunction with \nroad construction in Mongolia.  \n \n8.  With ADB\u2019s growing support for infrastructure projects in Mongolia, there is an increasing \nneed and demand for HIV/AIDS-related prevention initiatives to be incorporated into operations \nof infrastructure projects at all stages (pre-construction, construction, and post-construction). \nThis will require increasing national and local capacities to develop an effective response to \nHIV/AIDS.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n9.  The proposed TA is in line with ADB\u2019s strategic directions, and the recommendations of \nthe United Nations joint initiative in Mongolia, and also builds on the experience and lessons \nlearned from the ongoing ADB support on HIV prevention in the Regional Road Development \nProject.  The  proposed  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  strengthening  national  and  local \ncapacities to respond to the risk of the spread of HIV through major infrastructure and mining \nprojects.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  of  the  TA  is  prevention  of  the  spread  of  HIV  associated  with  major \ninfrastructure development, particularly in the road, transport, and mining sectors in Mongolia. \nThe outcome of the TA is reduced risk of HIV/AIDS and/or STI transmission associated with \ninfrastructure development among construction workers, contractors, sex workers, and local \ncommunities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will have three components. \n \n12.  Component 1: Provision of HIV Prevention Services. The TA supports the provision \nof  HIV  prevention  services  in  three  infrastructure  sectors\u2014the  road,  mining,  and  urban \nsectors\u2014on a pilot basis to develop a model intervention package for the infrastructure sector. \nThe  component  includes  the  development  of  information,  education,  and  communication \nmaterials for awareness-raising and behavior change for the different categories of targeted \nmen and women in various settings such as construction sites, entertainment settings, transport \ncorridors and border areas, health facilities, and affected local communities. It also includes \nprovision  of  HIV  prevention  services  for  construction  workers,  sex  workers,  and  local \ncommunities. This component covers provision of HIV prevention services for the selected \nmines and ADB-financed infrastructure projects, including the proposed loan for the Western \nRegional Road Corridor Development Project \u2013 Phase I, the post-construction phase of the \nRegional Road Development Project, and the proposed South Gobi Infrastructure Development \nProject. Through the support of MONEF, the TA will develop or strengthen HIV prevention \nactivities in selected mines and surrounding communities. \n                                                 \n13 The Regional Road Development Project has been implemented since 2005 to construct a connecting road \nbetween Choyr and the border with the People\u2019s Republic of China at Zamyn-Uud, linking Mongolia to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation.  ", "4   \n \n13.  Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building. The TA will develop the institutional \nmechanisms and capacity for systematic integration of HIV/AIDS prevention programs into \ninfrastructure  projects. This  component  supports  (i)  development  of  HIV/AIDS  policies  and \nguidelines in the construction workplace; (ii) training and workshops for government agencies, \nhealth service providers, and private sector entities, both nationally and locally; and (iii) cross-\nborder cooperation for HIV prevention between Mongolia and the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n \n14.  Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation. The TA will develop an M&E system for the \npilot projects, which will be in line with the national M&E framework for HIV/AIDS including core \nindicators and measures. The design, development, and implementation of gender-sensitive \nsurveys (baseline and follow-up) will be supported by the TA. The TA will also prepare a \nknowledge product which incorporates lessons learned and policy recommendations of the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis from the Cooperation Fund for Fighting the Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired \nImmunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in Asia and the Pacific14 in the amount of $1,000,000 \nto be administered by ADB. The TA will finance consulting services; equipment and software; \nsurveys;  workshops  and  training;  information,  education,  and  communication  activities; \ncontingencies;  and  miscellaneous  administration  and  support  costs.  The  Government  will \nfinance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $200,000, through the provision of \ncounterpart staff, office facilities including in project aimags,15 and other support services. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months and is expected to begin in May 2009 at the \nlatest and be completed in April 2012. The office of the deputy prime minister will be the \nExecuting  Agency  (EA)  with  overall  responsibility  for  implementation  and  coordination  of \nactivities with other partners.   \n \n17.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  provide  strategic  orientation,  overall \nguidance on project implementation and policy development, and facilitate the links among key \nministries.  The  steering  committee  will  comprise  representatives  of  concerned  ministries, \nNational AIDS Committee, MONEF, selected nongovernment organizations and partners in \nMongolia, and ADB as an observer. The National AIDS Committee program manager under the \ndeputy prime minister will facilitate the link between the steering committee and the project.  \n \n18.  A project implementation unit (PIU), composed of a project manager, an administrator, \nand a technical officer funded by the project, will be attached to the deputy prime minister's \noffice. The TA will be implemented in close collaboration and coordination with the Ministry of \nHealth; Ministry of Road, Transport, and Tourism; Ministry of Industry and Trade; MONEF; the \nMongolian National Mining Association; and private mining companies.16 A PIU, under the PIU \nin the deputy prime minister's office, will be established in project aimags.17 The deputy prime \nminister will appoint a coordinator in each project aimag who is responsible for overseeing the \n                                                 \n14 Contributor: the Government of Sweden. Administered by the Asian Development Bank. \n15 Aimags are provincial administrative units. \n16 One of the major mining companies in Mongolia, Ivanhoe Mines Mongolia, is keen to collaborate with ADB on \nHIV/AIDS service provision in the context of its mining activities in South Gobi. Discussion about a public\u2013private \npartnership and collaboration mechanism with Ivanhoe Mines Mongolia is currently under way.  \n17 The proposed aimags for the three PIUs are Dornogovi, Omnogovi, and Hovd. Specific activities could also be \nextended to Selenge aimag. \n ", "  5\nimplementation of the HIV prevention and service delivery component. The Ministry of Health \nwill  also  mobilize  its  health  services  staff  at  the  aimag  and  soum18  levels  to  support  the \nimplementation of HIV prevention and service delivery components. \n \n19.  ADB will establish an advance payment facility for the PIU to support agreed cash \nexpenditures. ADB will ensure the PIU has sufficient financial management capability to handle \nthe advance payment facility. Costed activity proposals, approved by the EA, will be submitted \nto ADB for approval. The amount of advance and eligible expenditures for advance payment will \nbe arranged in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants \n(2008). All equipment and materials will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and ownership will be transferred to the \nGovernment after the TA. The equipment and materials procured include computers, software, \nprinters, and other equipment deemed necessary for the implementation of TA activities. \n \n20.  In consultation with the EA, ADB will engage three members for the PIU (national, 108 \nperson-months), an international policy and evaluation specialist (3 person-months), and an \nentity for M&E, and contract MONEF for implementation of TA activities in the mining sector. \nADB will recruit the consultants (on an individual basis since the assignments are small and \nstraightforward and do not need a team of experts or extra support from the consultant\u2019s home \noffice) and the entity in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). For the recruitment of the entity, the simplified technical proposal \nand the quality- and cost-based selection with a quality-cost ratio of 80:20 will be used. The PIU \nmembers will include a project manager with expertise in HIV/AIDS, a health education and \ntraining specialist, and an administrative and financial assistant. The consultants will carry out \nthe TA activities as defined in the outline terms of reference (Appendix 3). \n \n21.  The  results  of  the  project  will  be  disseminated  through  seminars  and  workshops, \nincluding the organization of two international conferences. A knowledge product (publication) \nwill be produced which will include the main findings and recommendations for the public and \nprivate sectors for the prevention of HIV in infrastructure projects. A manual for bringing HIV \nprevention activities into the mainstream in companies will also be produced. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for Fighting \nthe Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in Asia \nand the Pacific for HIV/AIDS Prevention in ADB Infrastructure Projects and the Mining Sector, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n18 Soums are administrative subunits of the province.
