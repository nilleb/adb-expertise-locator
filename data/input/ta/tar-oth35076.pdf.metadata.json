INTRODUCTION\n1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) made poverty reduction its overarching goal with\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the poverty reduction strategy in November 1999.1 With the adoption of\nboth a new private sector development strategy,2 and later good governance medium-term\nagenda and action plan,3 ADB clearly recognizes the contribution that the private sector and\ngood governance can make in reducing poverty in the region. To address these issues, ADB is\nundertaking numerous initiatives as part of its business processes and technical assistance\n(TA). The findings of these studies will be disseminated at various forums, including an annual\nmeeting seminar, to be held in May 2001. For this purpose, ADB will carry out a regional TA to\nfund disseminating study findings and encouraging high-level discussions on the issues.4 ADB\u2019s\nRETA Screening Committee approved the TA on 18 December 2000. The TA framework is\nprovided in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The  poverty  reduction  strategy  emphasizes  the  importance  of  transport,\ncommunications, and energy infrastructure as foundations for pro-poor, sustainable economic\ngrowth, one of the strategic pillars of poverty reduction. To share fully in economic advancement\nand human development, people need efficient transport and communications, and access to\nelectricity supply. ADB\u2019s experience in many of its developing member countries (DMCs) has\nshown that increasing the capacity of the primary transport network, electricity generation and\ntransmission, and communication network, are key to improving competitiveness and attracting\nprivate investment. Investment in rural transport and rural electrification provides the rural poor\nwith better access to economic opportunities, including facilitating their access to production\ninputs, reaching product markets, and having more available sources of employment. Rural\ninfrastructure also improves access to human development services and extension support, and\nhelps overcome problems of social exclusion due to remoteness.\n3.  The link between private sector development and poverty reduction can be summarized\nas follows:\n(i)  sustainable job creation\u2014the private sector\u2019s contribution to poverty reduction\nmainly comes through growth, employment, and income generation;\n(ii)  creation of \u201cfiscal space\u201d\u2014private infrastructure expenditures such as power,\nwater, roads, and telecommunications can allow governments to provide larger\nbudgets for social expenditures;\n(iii)  availability  of  infrastructure  services  to  the  poor\u2014in  their  bid  specifications,\ngovernments can include public obligations directed mainly to the poor;\n(iv)  regulation of private utilities\u2014effective regulation can ensure pro-poor outcomes\nfor services through better access and lower prices;\n(v)  lowered public debt\u2014proceeds from privatization can be used to decrease public\ndebt, fund new expenditures, and share benefits with the general population; and\n(vi)  responsible corporate citizenship\u2014private companies can directly improve the\nlives of poor people through the way they do business, by being sensitive to\n                                                \n1  R179-99: Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank,\n9 November 1999.\n2  R78-00: Private Sector Development Strategy, 30 March 2000.\n3  W4-00: Promoting Good Governance: ADB\u2019s Medium Term Agenda and Action Plan, 26 April 2000.\n4  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 20 February 2001.", "2\nsocial and environmental issues, health and safety, corruption, and the local\neconomy.\n4.  Similarly, good governance is essential if infrastructure is to realize its potential for\nreducing  poverty.  This  encompasses  all  aspects  of  infrastructure\u2014including  planning,\nconstruction, operation, and regulation. The procurement of infrastructure, often entailing large\ncontracts,  must  be  managed  judiciously  and  efficiently  for  the  potential  benefits  of  the\ninfrastructure to be realized. The quality and costs of transport and electricity supply, and their\ngeographical coverage and affordability to the poor, depend on having an appropriate regulatory\nframework to provide for competition and operational efficiency.\n5.  Moreover, overall governance is important in the public sector and corporate governance\nis essential in the private sector. Good governance of corporations is a source of competitive\nadvantage and is critical to economic and social progress. With globalization, firms must tap\ndomestic and international capital markets in quantities and ways that were inconceivable even\na decade ago. Increasingly, individual investors, funds, banks, and other financial institutions\nbase their decisions not only on a company\u2019s balance sheet and financial outlook, but also on its\nsocial and environmental reputation and its governance. This growing need to access financial\nresources, domestic and foreign, has brought corporate governance into prominence the world\nover.\n6.  Meanwhile, lessons drawn from the Asian financial crisis have pointed out the potential\nrisks  and  vulnerabilities  in  the  financial  system,  and  the  inherent  dangers  associated  with\ngrowing globalization and integration of weakly regulated and supervised financial systems. In\nresponse, the International Monetary Fund, the G-7,5 and other groups, including the Asia-\nPacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  Finance  Ministers  and  Central  Bank  Group,  have\nunderscored the need to strengthen financial systems, and have mandated the international\nfinancial institutions to launch efforts to promote the development of sound and stable financial\nsystems. ADB, in collaboration with the Financial Stability Forum, will invite experts directly\ninvolved in financial architecture to discuss the new international standards relating to practices\nin banking, securities markets, and the insurance and accounting sectors. This collaborative\nforum will include the views of representatives of international standard setting bodies and other\nagencies and experts.\n7.  ADB\u2019s 34th Annual Meeting will be an ideal forum for bringing new policies that ADB is\ncurrently implementing into the international discussion arena. Specifically, poverty reduction,\nprivate sector development, good governance, and stable financial structure are some of the\nmajor thrusts that ADB is addressing. Furthermore, the rapid globalization of the knowledge-\nbased economy presents enormous opportunities for the role of information and communication\ntechnology (ICT) in accelerating growth and reducing poverty by promoting access to and use of\nICT. Following the high-level discussions of the G-7 in Okinawa, the seminar on ICT will\nelaborate ways that ADB can strengthen DMCs\u2019 ICT development as it continues to assist\nDMCs in this area.\n                                                \n5 The G-7 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.", "3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n8. The TA will finance the six seminars and forums (paras. 11-12). Thus, the TA will (i)\npromote  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty  reduction  and  linkages  to  infrastructure\ndevelopment;  (ii)  enhance  ADB\u2019s  major  thrust  of  private  sector  development;  and  (iii)\ndemonstrate the linkages of infrastructure investment, corporate governance, and ICT with\npoverty  reduction.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  highlight  ADB\u2019s  initiatives  in  capital  market\ndevelopment; corporate governance through institutional strengthening of institutes of chartered\naccountants; and support for chambers of commerce, which are key stakeholders in private\nsector and capital markets development.\nB.  Scope\n9.  The  TA  includes  three  seminars  at  the  34th  Annual  Meeting:  (i)  Private  Sector\nDevelopment Strategy; (ii) The ICT Revolution: Can Asia Leapfrog Poverty Barriers?; and (iii)\nForum on the Implementation of International Financial Standards in Asia. In addition, the TA\ncovers the 3rd Asian Corporate Governance Roundtable, which will be held in Singapore on 4-6\nApril 2001; the 2nd World Chambers Congress in May 2001, which will include participation of\nlocal  chambers  of  commerce  from  DMCs  such  as  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  Cook\nIslands,  Kiribati,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Maldives,  Mongolia,\nNepal, and Vanuatu; and the international Symposium on Assessing the Impact of Transport\nand Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction, also in 2001. The TA is expected to be\ncompleted in December 2001.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10.  The estimated cost of the TA is $250,000, which will be financed on a grant basis from\nthe ADB-funded TA program. About $105,000 will cover the costs of three seminars at the\n34th Annual  Meeting  in  Honolulu,  Hawaii;  $50,000  for  the  3rd  Asian  Corporate  Governance\nRoundtable  in  Singapore;  $20,000  for  part  of  the  expenses  of  the  2nd  World  Chambers\nCongress  in  Seoul,  Republic  of  Korea;  and  $75,000  for  the  international  Symposium  on\nAssessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction. Detailed\ncost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. The estimate provides for costs of travel, honoraria\nfor guest speakers and resource persons, report preparation, documentation, and the conduct\nof the meetings.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n11.  ADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  East  Department  (IED),  Infrastructure  West  Department  (IWD),\nOffice of Information Systems and Technology (OIST), and Private Sector Group (PSG) are\ncoordinating the annual meeting seminars on (i) Private Sector Development Strategy; (ii) The\nICT Revolution: Can Asia Leapfrog Poverty Barriers?; and (iii) Forum on the Implementation of\nInternational Financial Standards in Asia. IWD will also cosponsor the 3rd Asian Corporate\nGovernance Roundtable in Singapore in April 2001, which will followup on the roundtable held\nin Hong Kong, China in April 2000. The Asian Corporate Governance Roundtable was initiated\nin an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) meeting in Seoul,", "4\nRepublic of Korea (March 1999), cosponsored by the Government of Japan and the World\nBank. This will be the second meeting in which ADB cosponsors an international conference on\ncorporate governance with OECD and the World Bank. ADB will bring in the Asian perspective\non the role of boards and stakeholders in corporate governance. The 3rd Asian Roundtable will\nbe  cohosted  by  the  Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore,  Singapore  Stock  Exchange,  and\nSingapore Institute of Directors.\n12.   In addition, ADB through IWD will support the 2nd World Chambers Congress in Seoul,\nRepublic of Korea, in May 2001. Participants will include representatives of local chambers of\ncommerce  from  various  DMCs.  The  congress  will  focus  on  themes  such  as  governance,\naccountability, and other key crosscutting issues\u2014all very much in line with ADB\u2019s foci. The\ncongress will also provide ADB an additional platform for disseminating information about its\nrelated activities through a booth and prominence in the write-ups for the World Chambers\nCongress. Finally, following the completion of TA for Assessing the Impact of Transport and\nEnergy  Infrastructure  on  Poverty  Reduction,6  IWD  will  coordinate  in  2001  an  International\nSymposium including national workshops in the TA countries.\n13.  Any consultants employed under the TA will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB should there\nbe a need to engage domestic consultants.\nIV.
