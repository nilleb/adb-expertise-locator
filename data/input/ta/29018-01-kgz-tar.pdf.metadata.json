INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (the Government) has requested technical\nassistance (TA) from the Bank for the purpose of strengthening environmental institutions and\nimproving procedures for environmental impact assessment (EIA). Advisory TA was included\nin the Bank's 1995 country operational program for the Kyrgyz Republic. At the request of the\nGovernment, a Mission visited the country between 16 and 25 May 1995 to conduct fact-finding\nand to formulate the TA. The Mission confirmed the need for the TA and reached an\nunderstanding with Government officials concerning the objectives, scope, costs, financing plan,\nand implementation arrangements for the TA and the terms of reference for the consultants.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Kyrgyz Republic inherited its basic institutional and policy framework for\nenvironmental management from the former Soviet Union (FSU). In particular, resources were\ncentrally allocated, physical performance targets were preeminent in importance, and the\nadministered price system and budget policy placed little value on conservation of natural\nresources. Since independence in 1991, many environmental problems appear to have\nimproved as a result of the economic downturn. Generally, pollution emissions and agricultural\nchemical contamination have declined as a result of production declines or cutbacks in the\napplication of polluting inputs. Other problems may have intensified, however, because of\nchanges in household and industrial consumption patterns. For example, deforestation may be\nincreasing as rural households are turning increasingly to wood for fuel. Pollution monitoring\nand regulatory enforcement have been seriously curtailed because of the lack of funds to\nsupport staff travel and because of the lack of monitoring equipment.\n3. The State Committee on Environmental Protection (SCEP) is the key agency in\ncharge of environmental policy and nature protection. It was established in 1988 as part of an\nall-Soviet Union effort to strengthen institutions in the environment sector. According to the\nEnvironmental Protection Act of 1991, a special Government Decree (No. 71 of 16 February\n1994) defines the position of SCEP within the Government and spells out its responsibilities.\nWith few exceptions (for example, the State Hydrometeorological Agency and the State Sanitary-\nEpidemiological Agency) Government units do not ordinarily incorporate environmental\nprotection or environmental awareness as part of their responsibilities. Among the agencies\ncurrently assigned environmental responsibilities, there is some overlap of functions, poor\ncoordination among parallel activities, and lack of coherence in the implementation of\nGovernment environmental policies. To improve the efficiency of environmental policy\ncoordination, formal links among the several agencies involved in environmental protection need\nto be established.\n4. SCEP has about 800 employees (at both the central and local levels) and is\norganized into monitoring, project assessment, planning, technical, and international cooperation\nsections. Under the monitoring section there are four units: air; water; land, radiation, and\nwaste; and flora, fauna, and conservation. Also under SCEP administration is the former Forestry\nDepartment, which is expected to become a separate agency soon. The SCEP structure is\nreplicated at the state (Oblast) level, where principal responsibilities are directed toward\nmonitoring and inspection of industrial pollution sources. Main SCEP functions include\nThe TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in April 1995.", "2\n(i) inspection and monitoring of natural resources, (ii) preparation of environmental assessments\nfor industry, (iii) analytical services (laboratories), (iv) recommendations on environmental\nlegislation and control, (v) forestry inspection, and (vi) control of licensing for hunting and\nfishing.\n5. For environmental assessment, SCEP uses what is termed an \"ecological\npassport.\" The passport describes an industrial plant, production methods, resources used, and\nwastes produced. Permissible amounts of effluents and/or emissions are noted, and the\ntechnologies for meeting standards are described. Ecological passports are prepared initially\nwhen various industrial facilities are established. Updates are required every five years unless\nthere is a modification in the industrial plant or process. The preparation of ecological passports\nand ensuring adherence to them are the responsibility of designated specialists within each\nindustry sector. Although each industrial plant is required by law to prepare and observe an\necological passport, lack of coherence in classification of environmental hazards/impacts, faulty\nmonitoring equipment, lax enforcement, and economic production priorities result in low\ncompliance rates.\n6. Kyrgyz environmental scientists are well trained and highly professional. However,\nfew have been exposed to Western methods of environmental assessment and management,\nand most have only limited access to scientific information. Many have expressed interest in\nbecoming acquainted with other techniques and experiences. Moreover, reduced budgetary\nresources in recent years have further diminished the capacity to conduct effective monitoring\nand environmental enforcement.\n7. The National Environmental Action Plan (N EAP) identifies support for more efficient\nenvironmental institutions and effective environmental policy as high priority activities. Training\nenvironmental staff of Government and quasigovernment organizations is emphasized,\nparticularly in the use of international standards for EIA. This will promote harmonization with\ninternational environmental standards, and will help ensure that new economic activities meet\nall the necessary environmental requirements of international lending institutions. On-the-lob\ntraining and international exchanges are recommended. Ensuring enforcement of standards and\nregulations is a key objective of the NEAP, which requires (i) properly set standards, and (ii) an\neffective monitoring system. Additionally, there is a need to review environmental laws and\nregulations inherited from the FSU in order to develop a coherent legislative system that\ncorresponds to the requirements of economic transition and the implementation capacity of the\nenvironmental authorities.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The aims of the TA are to strengthen the institutional capacity of SCEP so as to\nenable it to conduct ElAs using new procedures and guidelines in harmony with international\nenvironmental standards, and to help ensure that new economic activities in the Kyrgyz Republic\nmeet all the necessary environmental requirements of international lending agencies. Activities\nunder the TA for strengthening environmental institutions and introducing improved procedures\nfor EIA will cover four major areas: (I) institutional development, (ii) EIA training,\n(iii) environmental laws and regulations, and (iv) initial preparation for establishing an efficient", "3\nand effective environmental monitoring network.\nB.\t Scope\n9. Under the area of institutional development, consultants will work with SCEP to\ndevelop institutional arrangements to implement EIA and other environmental regulations.\nProvision will be made to enhance interagency coordination and cooperation to ensure that the\nEIA program is effective. Environmental policies will be reviewed to facilitate the formulation and\nadjustment of policies to achieve compliance with both locally formulated standards and the\nenvironmental assessment requirements of major international agencies.\n10. On-the-job training, case studies, and other relevant training materials will be used\nto provide training in all aspects of EIA. The training will be conducted in Russian (with\ninterpretation to and from English where required), and will initially focus on staff in central\nagencies. In addition, other public sector officials and managers of private sector enterprises\nwill be given brief seminars so they may appreciate the role of EIA as a tool for the introduction\nof safe, cleaner, and environmentally sound development. The consultants will also review all\nenvironment-related legislation to identify gaps or deficiencies that may arise in harmonizing the\nlaws and regulatory framework for environmental protection with international standards and the\nenvironmental requirements of international lending institutions. The requirements for upgrading\nof institutional capacity for environmental monitoring to ensure compliance with the\nimplementation of EIA recommendations during construction and operation of new projects will\nbe determined. Detailed terms of reference for the TA are provided in Appendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The TA will finance the costs of international and domestic consulting services;\nportable environmental monitoring equipment for case studies; minor office and training\nequipment (computers, printers, and audio-visual equipment); workshop and other training\nmaterials; reports; and local logistical support (including transportation, translation, and\ninterpretation).\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $578,000 equivalent, comprising about\n$503,800 in foreign exchange and $74,200 equivalent in local currency. An amount equivalent\nto $556,000 will be provided by the Bank as a grant to finance the entire foreign exchange cost\nand $52,200 equivalent of the local currency cost. The balance of the local currency cost in the\namount of $22,000 equivalent, mainly for in-kind support (office space, training facilities, and\ncounterpart staff), will be provided by SCEP. A breakdown of the cost estimates and financing\nplan is given in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n13. The TA will be undertaken by a team of international and domestic consultants.\nThe consultants will provide a total of 16 person-months of international and 8 person-months\nof domestic consulting services. The international consultants will comprise the team leader/EIA\nexpert (5 months), an environmental education expert (4 months), an environmental law expert\n(3 months), and an environmental monitoring expert (4 months). The domestic consultants will\nassist the international consultants in understanding local EIA methods and in the provision of", "4\nenvironmental training. Budgetary provision is made for the use of local resources for translation\nand interpretation. It is envisioned that services will be provided over a period of about\n8 months. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants. The procurement of office and environmental monitoring equipment will be in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.\n14. SCEP will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Chairman of SCEP will have\noverall responsibility for supervising the TA. The Chairman may delegate responsibilities for\ngeneral administration and coordination of the TA to a senior level officer as required. SCEP will\nbe responsible for making available suitable counterpart staff to assist in the institutional training\nactivities, including the selection of appropriate trainees and participants for workshops and case\nstudy preparation. It is envisioned that the training consultants will work closely with the NEAP\nCoordinating Team, which will also be housed in SCEP. Office accommodation and lecture\nfacilities presently available at SCEP headquarters will be made available as required to facilitate\neffective implementation.\n15. The consultant team, in coordination with the counterpart staff of SCEP, will\nprepare three reports for review by the Executing Agency and the Bank. An inception report will\nbe submitted at the end of the fourth week after contract commencement. The inception report\nwill comprise a detailed work plan outlining the staff resources that will be used, the schedule\nand timing of key inputs, arrangements for interagency coordination, and expected financial\nresources required to achieve all items outlined in the detailed terms of reference. This report\nwill be followed by a tripartite meeting to discuss and agree on the work program.\nApproximately 16 weeks after commencement, a midterm report will be submitted describing\nachievements, including analyses of case study exercises, preliminary recommendations\nregarding environmental laws and regulations, and proposals for an environmental monitoring\nframework. The draft final report will be submitted at the end of the seventh month after\ncommencement. A tripartite meeting will review the progress and achievements under the TA\nand examine the need for additional capacity-building activities in the environment sector. The\nfinal report will be submitted within three weeks after the final tripartite review and will incorporate\ncomments from the Government and the Bank.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the\nKyrgyz Republic in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $556,000, for the purpose of\nStrengthening Environmental Institutions and Improving Procedures for Environmental Impact\nAssessment, and hereby reports his action to the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1\nPage 1\nGENERAL TERMS OF REFERENCE\nI. SCOPE AND WORK PROGRAM\n1. Under the technical assistance (TA), the consultants' activities for strengthening\nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) capabilities and institutional capacity will cover, but not\nbe limited to, four major areas: institutional development, training, environmental laws and\nregulations, and review of procedures for compliance monitoring. These terms of reference\ncover the activities of both international consultants - including an EIA expert, an environmental\neducation expert, an environmental law expert, and an environmental monitoring expert - and\nthe domestic consultants, who will be knowledgeable about environmental activities in Kyrgyz\nRepublic. The initial task of the consultants will be to develop a specific work plan, in close\nconsultation with senior officials of the State Committee on Environment Protection (SCEP),\nwhich will be the basis for the inception report.\nA.\t Institutional Development\n2. The consultants will assist the SCEP in formalizing the institutional arrangements\nrequired to implement EIA and other environmental regulations including the arrangements for\ninteragency coordination and cooperation to ensure the EIA program is effective. The\nconsultants will assess procedures established to ensure interagency coordination and\ncooperation on environmental matters. Policies and institutional arrangements will be examined\nand recommendations made to introduce EIA capable of achieving compliance with both locally\nformulated standards and the environmental assessment requirements of major international\nfunding agencies.\nB.\t Environmental Impact Assessment Training\n3. The consultants will provide training to their counterparts, 1 using on-the-job\ntraining, case studies and other relevant training materials, in the following subject areas:\nenvironmental screening of development projects; preparation of an EtA study; review of EtA\nreports submitted by project proponents; monitoring the implementation of EIA recommendations\nduring both the construction and the operational phases of projects; integration of EIA with\ndevelopment planning at the project, sectoral, provincial, and regional levels; and management\nand administration of EtA. Brief 1-2 day seminars will be given to senior Government and private\nsector officials to discuss the role of environmental assessment in economic development in\ntransitional societies. At least two case studies will be undertaken to complement the training\ncourses in critical environmental areas such as mining, thermal power generation, treatment of\nTrainees might be drawn from professional staff of SCEP at both central and regional levels, as well staff of\nother agencies of the Government engaged in environmental assessment and monitoring including such\nagencies as the Forest Department, State Hydrometeorological Agency, Sanitary-Epidemiological Service,\nGosgortechnadzor, Institute of Land Use and Utilization, operational ministries, research institutes and\nuniversities, municipal services and others.
