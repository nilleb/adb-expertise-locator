INTRODUCTION \n1.  It is now widely acknowledged that natural systems such as forests, wetlands, and coral \nreefs provide many important and economically valuable services that are rarely captured by \nmarkets.  These  ecosystem  services  continue  to  decline  due  to  resource  degradation,  often \ncaused by weak property rights, perverse policies, and other market forces.1 \n \n2.  The most valuable ecosystem services have been classified into four broad categories: (i) \ncarbon sequestration, to mitigate climate change; (ii) watershed protection, to provide clean and \nreliable  water  supplies;  (iii)  biodiversity  conservation,  to  maintain  nature\u2019s  store  of  genetic \nmaterials for science and to support earth\u2019s life systems; and (iv) land or seascape amenities, to \nsupport  fisheries,  agriculture,  nature-based  tourism,  and  other  natural  resource  dependent \nindustries. \n \n3.  To sustain the provision of these services and the financing needed for management of \nnatural systems from which they are derived, market creation approaches are increasingly being \nused. These allow for transactions between those who directly benefit from these services and \nthose  in  a  position  to  sustainably  manage  the  forests,  reefs,  or  other  natural  systems.  The \nvoluntary  carbon  market,  for  example,  is  financing  forest  protection  to  maintain  carbon \nsequestered from the atmosphere in forests. The Bali road map to a new global climate change \nregime organized under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \ncalls for expanding such efforts through reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation \n(REDD).  \n \n4.  Such market mechanisms are being developed around the world, but Asia and the Pacific \nhave been less active than others. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) can play a role in helping \nits developing member countries (DMCs) understand and benefit from the new opportunities \noffered by these approaches while managing the accompanying risks. The technical assistance \n(TA) described herein2 will assist with the development of specific applications and guidelines to \naid their expansion\u2014especially relating to carbon sequestration, watershed protection, and land or \nseascape benefits.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Ecosystems3 provide important services to society, including (i) provisioning services, such \nas food and water; (ii) regulating services, such as regulation of floods, drought, land degradation, \nand disease; (iii) supporting services, such as soil formation and nutrient cycling; and (iv) cultural \nservices, such as spiritual, religious, recreational, and other nonmaterial benefits. In the view of \nthe  United  Nations  2005  Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment,  these  services  influence  the \ndeterminants and constituents of human wellbeing, which include (i) security, (ii) basic material for \na good life, (iii) health, (iv) good social relations, and (v) freedom and choice. Researchers have \nestimated the annual value of such global ecological services to be in the range of $18 trillion\u2013$61 \ntrillion. \n \n                                                 \n1  Trivedi, Mandar, Andrew Mitchell, and Niki Mardas. 2008. The Utility Value of Rainforests. In Financing Sustainable \nForest Management (European Tropical Forest Research Network [ETFRN] News Issue No.49, Sept 2008). Edited by \nHolopainen, Jani and Marieke Wit. Waganigen, the Netherlands: Tropenbos International. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on July 2008. \n3  An ecosystem is taken to be a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism communities, as well as the \nnonliving environment interacting as a functional unit. \n ", "2   \n6.  Capturing economic benefits from ecosystem services can directly contribute to poverty \nreduction. A recent ADB study4 shows that ecosystem services support the livelihoods and health \nof poor people who are often dependent upon natural systems for their welfare. The stability of \necosystem  services  also  underpins  domestic  savings  and  raw  materials  needed  to  further \neconomic growth. In many low-income countries, ecosystems and the economic activities they \nsupport provide products and revenue for daily needs as well as poverty-reducing investments in \nterms of reinvested rural savings, and they are often a principal source of tax revenue to finance \ndevelopment programs.  \n \n7.  The crucial question is how to finance sustainable and equitable management of these \nvaluable ecosystem services so that they are maintained or enhanced. Recent trends show that \npublic spending on the environment is declining. For instance, official development assistance for \nsustainable forest management has declined by almost 50% over the last decade on a global \nscale, and support for protected areas has fallen. \n \n8.  In the past, information and market failures have prevented the private sector from using \nmarket opportunities to support provision of ecosystem services. But today, innovative initiatives, \nbacked by necessary flexible regulatory frameworks, have made market exchange of ecosystem \nservices possible. Key issues that need to be addressed include (i) demonstrating the value of \nenvironmental services, both regional and global; (ii) creating methods to monitor them; and (iii) \nensuring that the market mechanisms promote equity at the individual, community, national, and \ninternational levels. \n \n9.  Carbon sequestration in particular is likely to play an increasingly important role in post-\n2012 global climate change efforts, especially since more than 75% of greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom countries such as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nand Solomon Islands come from deforestation. REDD systems have the potential to become an \neffective tool for climate change mitigation if their design and implementation maximize benefits to \npoor communities dependent upon forest resources for their livelihoods. The challenge is to \nestablish mechanisms that will enable the many potential sellers\u2014including governments, private \ncompanies  holding  forest  concessions,  and  community  forestry  groups\u2014to  complete  REDD \napplications and validation processes. \n \n10.  ADB has an early and still emerging portfolio of projects that are experimenting with market \nsystems for provision of ecosystem services. Recent initiatives include the Indonesia pilot and \ndemonstration activities using compensation mechanism for watershed protection services in the \nCitarum River Basin5 with grant funding under the ADB Water Financing Partnership Facility, as \nwell  as  the  TA  on  Carbon  Sequestration  through  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  in \nIndonesia.6 The proposed TA will broaden opportunities for knowledge sharing among these types \nof projects and expand the numbers of complementary pilot activities. \n \n11.  It is envisioned that this TA will form the basis for development of a technical support \nfacility  to  aid  such  transactions  and  help  ADB\u2019s  operational  departments  identify  levers  for \nincorporating appreciation for, and the application of markets for, ecosystem services into ADB \ndevelopment investments. \n                                                 \n4  Steele, Paul, G.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The goal of this TA is to promote expansion of markets for ecosystem services in Asia and \nthe Pacific. The TA is designed to support development of ADB projects at the local, national, and \nregional levels through identification and demonstration of opportunities to include the capture of \neconomic  benefits  from  ecosystem  services  in  project  design.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n13.  The specific objectives include the following: \n \n(i)  To raise the level of awareness among key stakeholders about the benefits of \nexpanded  markets  for  ecosystem  services  in  responding  to  environment  and \ndevelopment goals. \n(ii)  To demonstrate related market and associated policy and institutional mechanisms \nfor ecosystem service transactions in selected sites for learning and subsequent \nreplication, especially to capture financial transfers through the carbon market.  \n(iii)  To identify levers for incorporating appreciation for, and application of markets for, \necosystem services into ADB investments. \n \nB.  Approach and Key Activities \n14.  The TA implementation will be linked to ADB TA and project design as well as wider \ncountry programming, and it will be carried out in direct collaboration with operational departments. \nThe TA activities are grouped under four components with corresponding outputs: \n \n(i)  Documentation of mechanisms to create markets for ecosystem services. \nInformation  on  existing  mechanisms  will  be  compiled  and  analyzed  to  identify \nlessons learned for application. A compendium of illustrative cases, especially from \nAsia and the Pacific, will be produced. \n(ii)  Identification  of  key  stakeholders.  The  key  stakeholders  will  include \ngovernments,  conservation  organizations,  indigenous  peoples\u2019  organizations, \ncommunity  forestry  groups,  research  organizations,  practitioners,  and  private \ncompanies who purchase and sell ecosystem services (such as through the carbon \nmarket) in local or global markets. This will build on the first component, and an \nimproved understanding and registry of key stakeholders will be produced. \n(iii)  National  and  regional  consultations.  To  build  regional  understanding  and \nconsensus on promising approaches, a meeting or meetings will be held to learn \nfrom leading thinkers and practitioners in this field drawn from the region and \nelsewhere. Key resource persons will be scholars, researchers, practitioners, and \nprivate sector representatives from the range of buyers of ecosystem services. A \nmarketplace  function  may  be  considered  if  project  concepts  are  sufficiently \ndeveloped.  The  results  of  all  meetings  will  be  prepared  and  disseminated  as \nknowledge products. \n(iv)  Learning sites. Mechanisms to demonstrate markets for ecosystem services will \nbe designed and implemented in selected DMC sites. Such pilot activities will \naddress  environmental  goals  (i.e.,  local  and/or  global  sustainability)  and \ndevelopment  goals  (i.e.,  livelihood  sustainability  and  poverty  alleviation). \nDocumentation of the case studies, in particular lessons learned, will be prepared \nand disseminated.  \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is $600,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The cost will cover TA consultants and ADB \nstaff participating as resource persons in country programming and project missions, national and \nregional conferences and workshops, and publication and information services. The project will \nrecruit individual consultants, both international and national. Costs directly accruing to ADB have \nbeen limited to 10% of the total grant amount. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and will implement the TA through the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department\u2019s Climate Change Program Coordination Unit \nin close collaboration with the operational departments. ADB will continue to coordinate closely \nwith  other  international  financial  institutions  and  financing  partners,  for  instance  through  its \ninvolvement in the Poverty and Environment Partnership. The likely DMCs wherein this TA will be \nundertaken are Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Greater Mekong Subregion \ncountries such as Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Thailand. Activities \nfunded by this TA will begin in a particular DMC only after ADB has received written confirmation \nfrom the DMC government that it has no objection to its inclusion in the TA. The TA will be \nimplemented over 18 months, ideally starting from January 2009.  \n \n17.  Consultants to be engaged will bring expertise in the areas of environmental economics, \necology, ecosystems management, and the carbon market, among others. Implementation will \ninvolve national consultants from DMCs to support DMC governments and stakeholders and ADB \noperational departments as necessary. International consultants based at ADB headquarters will \nbe recruited to provide further technical support and will work together with national consultants. \nADB specialist staff will liaise with ADB operational departments as well as with those involved in \nsimilar initiatives. National consultants within identified DMCs will be engaged for a total of 24 \nperson-months, and international consultants for 15 person-months. Short-term consultants and \nresource persons will be recruited on an individual basis to fill skills gaps as needed. Individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  through  either  time-based  or  lump  sum  contracts.  Appendix  3 \npresents  the  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n18.  The TA implementers will coordinate with local embassies of Japan in all phases of the \nproject and will work to ensure maximum visibility of Japan Special Fund support as well as \nharmonization  and  coordination  with  other  Government  of  Japan-supported  initiatives  in  the \nidentified DMCs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The  President,  acting under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nCapturing Economic Benefits from Ecosystem Services, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.
