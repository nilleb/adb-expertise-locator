With Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization and the country\u2019s further \nintegration into the world economy, the Government recognizes that raising the industrial and \nbanking sectors\u2019 efficiency to an internationally competitive level will be foremost among the \nchallenges it faces. It has, therefore, reaffirmed that state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, \nparticularly phased government divestment in nonsensitive SOEs, is a key component of its \noverall  strategy,  and  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan 1  emphasizes  the  need  to \naccelerate change to achieve these objectives. \n \n2.  The Government requested Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) help  to formulate an \nassistance  modality  to  further  accelerate  SOE  reforms  and  enhance  overall  corporate \ngovernance. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will prepare the SOE Reform \nand Corporate Governance Facility (SRCGF). The TA is included in the country strategy and \nprogram (CSP) update, 2006\u20132008, while the proposed SRCGF is included in the CSP, 2007\u2013\n2010, for Viet Nam. The CSP reflects ADB\u2019s support for SOE reform as a means of continuing \nthe country's path toward economic growth and poverty reduction (the initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The SOE sector (which includes state-owned commercial banks [SOCBs]) is critical to \ncontinued economic growth. SOEs account for over a third of gross domestic product (GDP) \nand roughly half of exports. SOEs also contribute about 70% of tax revenue (as value-added \nand corporate income taxes). Yet, they pose a number of major challenges. SOE debt, a large \nportion  of  which  is  nonperforming,  has  been  estimated  at  about  one  half  of  GDP.  SOE \nperformance  has  been  impeded  as  many  enterprises  face  rising  inventories,  low  financial \nreserves, and high debt levels. One half of SOEs are either loss making or marginally profitable. \n \n4.  SOE reform efforts began in earnest in the late 1990s and accelerated in 2000 with the \nadoption  of  a  comprehensive  5-year  SOE  reform  plan,  which  sets  annual  targets  for \ntransforming  SOEs.  SOE  restructuring  options  include  equitization,  conversion  to  a  single-\nmember limited liability company, merger, sale, lease liquidation, or bankruptcy. (As over 90% \nof SOE transformations are via equitization, it has received the most attention within and outside \nthe Government.) SOEs that are deemed to be of key strategic value or that operate in areas of \nnational interest must remain 100% state-owned. Improvements in corporate governance have \nbeen modest. The Government officially reaffirmed its commitment in 2005 to equitize about \n50% of remaining SOEs within the next 3 years. The New Enterprise Law of 2005 provides that \nall remaining SOEs must be corporatized by 2010.  \n \n5.  SOE reform is a multi-step process that includes transformation, equitization, and listing. \nEquitization is the transformation of an enterprise into a joint stock company that operates under \nthe Enterprise Law applicable to private enterprises. Equitization has been streamlined through \nthe revised legal framework, and a number of incremental policy initiatives support the listing of \nequitized  enterprises.  However,  accomplishments  have  fallen  short  of  targets,  and  most \nequitizations have been carried out in small and medium-sized enterprises. The more difficult \n                                                 \n1   Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2006. The Five-Year Socio Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010.

Before  and  after  equitization,  however,  to  undertake  the  required \nsequence of activities the large SOEs require significant financial resources, which they do not \nhave, and Government support will result in a hefty fiscal burden.  \n \nReorganization of State-Owned Enterprises, 2001\u20132005 \n \nIndicator   2001     2002      2003    2004      2005          Total \n                                                        (est.)    2001\u20132005 \nTotal restructured and/or established  380         408         895        971      918         3,572 \nEquitized  205         164         532        753       724        2,378  \nAssigned    18           34           51          24         12           139 \nSold    16           17           24          19         18             94 \nMerged/unified  119         127          202         75         50           573 \nDissolved    22           27            50         35         30           164 \nBankrupt/liquidated      0             2              4         12         12             30 \nTransform to one-owner limited liability company      0             0             14         41        60           115 \nNewly established state-owned enterprises      0           37             18         12        12             79 \nSource: Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2006\u20132010. \n \n6.  In 2003, the Government created the Debt Asset Trading Corporation (DATC) within the \nMinistry of Finance to, among other things, help SOEs restructure their debt before equitization. \nAlthough set up by the Government as a centralized asset management company, DATC is \nhampered by the lack of enabling powers and regulations to carry out its mandate. It does not \npossess the skills and capacity to resolve distressed assets. Efforts will be needed to strengthen \nthe newly established State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC) to manage state equity in \nfirms and invest state-owned assets assigned by the Government. SCIC began operations in \nAugust 2006 and, as of September 2006, was representing Government ownership in 70 SOEs. \nThe Government eventually plans to run SCIC based on Singapore\u2019s Temasek model. A social \nsafety fund was established in 2005 to compensate, and fund training of, employees rendered \nredundant by restructuring. \n \n7.  The net result is that only about 14% of state capital had been transferred to the private \nsector by the end of 2005, with a large proportion of shareholders being existing employees. \nCorporate governance standards have improved modestly at best. Based on the sector study \ncompleted in 2005 the major barriers against SOE reform are outlined below.4  \n \nA.  Equitization  and  Listing  of  State-Owned  Commercial  Banks  and  General \nCorporation Groups Slowed by Limited Financial Resources \n \n8.  The SOE sector study noted that the transformation and eventual equitization of SOCBs \nand GCs will be costly and difficult. Without the necessary support, reform of the largest GCs \n                                                 \n3  Viet Nam has 5 SOCBs and 91 GCs. The Government organized about 2,000 SOEs into 17 general corporations \n(GCs) or conglomerates and 77 special GCs. The 17 GCs, referred to as \u201cGC 91s\u201d report to the Prime Minister, \nwhile the 77 special GCs, or \u201cGC 90s\u201d report to line ministries. In 2002, these 94 GCs included 1,605 member \nSOEs and represented 65% of the capital of all SOEs. \n4   The sector study was undertaken in 2004- 2005 through ADB.1999. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Program. Manila (TA 3353-VIE, \napproved on 21 December 1999).  \n ", "  3\nand SOCBs is expected to be considerably delayed. A simplified summary of the steps for a GC \nor SOCB to transform, equitize, and list in the stock exchange is in Appendix 5. \n \n9.  State-Owned Commercial Banks. Organizational and financial restructuring of SOCBs \nhas proven difficult and occurs immediately before equitization. A major difficulty facing all \nSOCBs  is  resolution  and/or  restructuring  of  their  nonperforming  loans,  which  lowers  their \noperational efficiency and capital adequacy ratios. Asset classifications and income recognition \nin the banking industry are based on the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, which tend to \nresult  in  underreporting  of  NPLs.  Subscribing  to  the  International  Accounting  Standards  is \nexpected to lead to recognition of a higher level of NPLs. Solving the problem of high NPLs \nthrough  financial  restructuring  before  equitization  will  therefore  require  significant  capital \ninfusion. Although no SOCB has yet been equitized or listed, the Government plans to equitize \nVietcombank and Mekong Housing Bank (MHB) during the fourth quarter of 2006 or early 2007. \nVietnam Industrial & Commercial Bank (Incombank), Bank of Investment & Development of \nVietnam (BIDV), and Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) will be \nfinancially  restructured  and  equitized  later.  The  SOE  sector  study  identified  the  need  for \nsignificant long-term financial support to SOCBs that are slated for equitization to amortize the \ncosts of restructuring and equitization over longer periods. Such long-term financing would \nincrease their competitiveness, strengthen their post-equitization financial structure, indirectly \nrecapitalize SOCBs, and increase their long-term viability, which has become more relevant in \nthe wake of Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization.   \n \n10.  General Corporations. All member SOEs within a GC cluster (footnote 3) must be \ntransformed, usually by equitization, before the apex GC is equitized. This means that the \ntransformation of the most difficult SOE in the cluster will delay the whole process for all SOEs \nin the cluster, including the apex GC. It also means that the largest entities (where the potential \nbenefits of corporatization are the greatest) will have the greatest difficulties. Debt or liability \nrestructuring is estimated at about 90% of the equitization cost for GCs. GCs will be unable to \namortize these costs over a suitable period because access to long-term financing is limited, \nreducing  their  competitiveness  and  hindering  equitization.  Indeed,  no  large  GC  has  yet \ncompleted the process even though some started 2 years ago. Of the 124 GCs that have \nannounced their intention to be converted into holding companies and to be equitized, 52 have \nhad their transformation proposals approved but only 8 have reached the third stage, able to \noperate under the new model. No GC has yet both equitized and listed its shares on the stock \nexchange. \n  \nB.  Institutional Support Needed for DATC and SCIC \n \n11.  Estimates put total SOE debt at about half of GDP, with about $1.8 billion classified as \nnonperforming. The legal mechanisms to resolve nonperforming loans need to be carefully \nreviewed, and enforcement of foreclosure provisions improved, with more clarity, particularly on \nland-use rights. State-directed lending has exacerbated the problem and caused difficulties for \nSOCBs.  \n \n12.  Equitization should be viewed as only the first step in the long transformation of an SOE \ninto a globally competitive enterprise. For example, while Viet Nam has equitized more than \n3,000 companies, only 53 are listed.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The  TA\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  prepare  the  SRCGF  by  formulating  a  focused  and \nsequenced series of measures to facilitate SOE reform and enhance corporate governance. \nThe measures will be consistent with and supplementary to the Government\u2019s overall strategy \nfor SOE reform. Recognizing that SOE reform is a long process and will not be advanced by \nstand-alone projects, the TA will follow a sector-based and multi-tranche lending modality for the \nensuing loan project, covering the Socio-Economic Development Plan period (2007\u20132010). In \nconsultation with the Government and other stakeholders, the TA outputs will include detailed \ndesign of the SRCGF into two components:  \n \n1.  Component I: Design Assistance for Equitization  \nand Listing of SOCBs/GCs  \n14.  The TA will develop a modality for providing financial and technical support to select \nSOCBs/GCs for equitization and listing, with a clear set of selection criteria and guidelines for \nproject implementation. The financing scheme will be used for the direct costs of equitization \nand listing, including asset restructuring (SOCBs) and debt/liability restructuring (GCs). The \nSOCBs will need to classify bad debts and make provisions according to international standards, \nand  then  assess  the  extent  of  additional  capital  required  to  meet  the  prescribed  capital \nadequacy standards. Similarly, GCs will have to resolve troublesome debts before equitization. \nIn consultation with the Government, the TA will assess and identify GCs and SOCBs for \nparticipation under the SRCGF requiring the above assistance, including the amount. \n \n15.  The TA will clearly identify the technical inputs needed by the selected SOCBs and GCs \nto undertake activities that are considered direct costs and not funded by the Government, such \nas (i) financial restructuring, (ii) valuation for equitization, and (iii) listing in the formal stock \nexchange.  This  component  entails  financial  support  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nunder the SRCGF. \n \n2.  Component II: Design an Institutional Development Scheme  \nfor SOE Reform \n \n16.  The TA will identify a set of specific measures to support the institutional development of \nDATC and SCIC to ensure their long-term sustainability and effectiveness, including various \ninstitutional  and  human  resource  development  components.  The  TA  will  examine  and \nrecommend legal and policy reforms to improve these institutions and promote SOE reforms. \nThe TA will further examine and recommend measures for reforming organizational structures \nto improve corporate governance and operational efficiency in the selected GCs and SOCBs. \nFunding  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  window  under  the  SRCGF  is  envisaged  to \nimplement these measures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The design of the SRCGF\u2019s components will initially be based on the recent SOE sector \nstudy and feedback given to ADB by the Government and its agencies. Participatory workshops \nwill be organized to build consensus on the outputs.  The TA will be implemented in two phases, \ncommencing in March 2007. Phase 1 will cover all the activities as stated in paras. 14\u201316, and \ninclude the detailed design for the SRCGF, including procedures, strategies, and operational \n ", "  5\nplans for each component; the institutional capacity development plan; a draft development \npolicy matrix; and implementation arrangements. To ease the transition to implementation, \n$175,000 from the TA will be used separately on an agreed plan at the end of the final design \nand start of the SRCGF under phase 2. The allocation of consultant resources for phase 2 will \nbe decided by ADB in consultation with Government under a separate contract, preferably with \nthe consulting firm engaged under phase 1 subject to satisfactory performance in the initial \nassignment. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost a total $1,000,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$800,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Technical Assistance Special Fund \n($300,000)  and  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Fund  ($500,000)  and \nadministered by ADB. The Government will provide the remaining $200,000 equivalent by \nproviding counterpart staff and other support facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  while  its  Enterprise \nDepartment  (for  GCs),  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV,  for  SOCBs),  and  the  (National \nSteering  Committee  for  Enterprise  Reform  and  Development  (NSCERD,  for  overall  policy \ndevelopment) will be the implementing agencies. In addition to stakeholder reviews, a steering \ncommittee  will  provide  guidance.  It  will  be  chaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  finance  or  his \nrepresentative, and comprise the Enterprise Department, SBV, the State Securities Commission, \nNSCERD, and the line ministries of GCs that have been selected for support under the SRCGF. \nTripartite  review  meetings  involving  the  steering  committee,  consultants,  and  ADB  will  be \nchaired by MOF. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 17 months, from early March 2007 to July 2008. The \nTA implementation will be contracted out to an international consulting firm for 16.0 person-\nmonths for international and 16.5 person-months for national consulting services to carry out \nphase 1. (The allocation of resources for phase 2 will be decided at the end of the final design \nand start of the SRCGF under a separate contract [para. 17].) The fixed-budget selection \nmethod is proposed to select the consultants. Short-listed firms will submit technical proposals \nwith detailed terms of reference. All the consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund, and (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $300,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam for preparing the State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate \nGovernance Facilitation Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING
