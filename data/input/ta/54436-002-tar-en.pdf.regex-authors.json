The REG: Technical Assistance for the Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace, approved in \nNovember  2020,  will  facilitate  and  broaden  access  to  finance  for  women  and  women's \nbusinesses and communicate ADB\u2019s efforts in this area to encourage more lending to this \nsector and also generate new business for ADB.1 Many financial institutions (FIs) in ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  have  not  targeted  women  borrowers  and  do  not \nrecognize the untapped commercial potential.2 They do not provide suitable and affordable \nproducts for this clientele or lack the awareness of the barriers women or women\u2019s businesses \nencounter when trying to access financial services. The impacts of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic have also reinforced the importance of a digital economy to change \nbusiness models into digital business models and to integrate digital channels into how financial \nservice providers or businesses engage with customers. Many women\u2019s businesses have also \nadversely been impacted by COVID-19. A survey on the impact of COVID-19 on women\u2019s \nbusinesses in Papua New Guinea (PNG) has for example found that 40.9% of smaller or semi-\nformal businesses have reported a temporary halt in operations. 3 \n \n2.  During  this  period  and  then  post-COVID-19  and  operating  under  the  \u201cnew  normal\u201d \nenvironment, a dedicated online platform can help support FIs and their existing and potential \nwomen borrowers. The Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace (the Marketplace) will, therefore, be \ninnovative in its work and take a digital approach for interaction and engagement as it will, \namong others, engage also through social media channels to build a subscriber and follower list \nand  facilitate the  engagement  of  an  online  community through  linkages  and  resources  on \ncontent relevant for the FIs and their female borrowers. The Marketplace will: (i) aggregate and \ndisseminate products on gender financing within ADB and to the broader external audience;  \n(ii) support the identification of cutting-edge technologies to digitize business models, such as \nalternative credit scoring models4,and delivery channels, which are expected to be piloted in one \nor two countries (PNG has been identified as the first), (iii) build capacity for FIs to promote \ngender-responsive financial service delivery and women\u2019s businesses to improve viability, as \nneeded, through a range of digital toolkits, webinars and online support, (iv) establish linkages \nto other programs and initiatives on enabling access to finance for women, internal and external \nto ADB5; and (v) create a community platform. The design, set-up, and maintenance of the \nMarketplace will be supported through the technical assistance (TA), Subproject 1. \n \n3.  The  transaction  technical  assistance  cluster  (TA  cluster)  is  envisaged  to  have  4 \nsubprojects:  (i)  Design,  Set  up  and  Maintenance  of  the  Marketplace,  (ii)  Innovation  and \nTechnologies, (iii) Capacity Building, and (iv) Expansion of the Marketplace. \n   \n \n1  Women\u2019s business in this context means micro-, small- and medium-sized women-owned or women-managed \nbusinesses. \n2  Financial institutions in this context are banks and non-bank financial institutions including microfinance institutions, \nhousing finance, and insurance companies, for instance. \n3  CIBE 2020.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n4.  This  is  the  first  subproject  under  the  REG:  Technical  Assistance  for  the  Women\u2019s \nFinancing Marketplace. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n \n5.  The TA cluster has the following overall outcome: sustainable financial inclusion for \nwomen and women\u2019s businesses increased. Subproject 1 will contribute to this through the \ndesign, set-up, and maintenance of the Marketplace.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities  \n \n6.  Output 1: Finalized Design and Set up of the Marketplace. To achieve the objective \nof an online interactive platform that is frequently used, requires a good understanding of the \nemerging issues in gender-responsive financing, innovative technologies to digitize gender- \nresponsive  financial  services  delivery  or  women\u2019s  businesses  operating  models  and \nidentification of other support needs of the target group (foremost FIs and women\u2019s businesses). \nThis entails moving to a more engaging approach which creates interaction between ADB and \nthe target audience in DMCs. During and post COVID-19, it will also require a digital approach \nto interaction and engagement \u2013 including using social media channels such as LinkedIn, \nFacebook or Twitter, for capacity building and support for cutting-edge technology. Constant \nmonitoring of data on website traffic, preferences, feedback, trends and audience appetite and \ninterests will help to further develop the platform. It is envisaged that the establishment of the \nMarketplace will happen in stages, whereby the first stage will be to set-up a landing page at \nADB.org with the support of the Department of Communications (DOC).6 After a review at the \nend of year one, it will be decided together with DOC how additional necessary features can be \nfurther supported by ADB.org or whether other solutions should be evaluated.  \n \n7.  As a first step, a mapping of existing gender finance initiatives, data analytics and survey \nwith PSFI\u2019s clients will be conducted. Together with a digital agency, the look and feel of the \nwebsite and interaction with clients/people through social media channels (Facebook, LinkedIn, \nTwitter, etc.) and subscribers to the website (newsletter, updates, specific digital services), the \nwebsite will be designed taking into consideration such feedback. Second, partnerships with \npublic and private sector stakeholders and linkages with other initiatives will be facilitated. Third, \nADB\u2019s content on gender-based financing will be identified and transformed into a user friendly, \ndigital content for the website. \n \n8.  Output 2: Maintenance of the Marketplace. A key challenge will be to create sufficient \nquality content that the audience would find interesting and with which they are likely to engage. \nIn addition, it will be important to publicize and disseminate the platform\u2019s content and activities. \nThis will be achieved through a range of activities, such as website updates, newsletters and \nother social media cross-promotions and institutional partnerships. To support ADB with these \nactivities, resources will be contracted. During this time, the subscriber base and social media \ncontacts will be built-up to start interaction to \u201cfeel the pulse\u201d of the community and obtain early \n \n6  DOC\u2019s support will be through their involvement in the design phase of the website as well as updating of content. \nAdditional resources have been allocated in the budget to complement DOC. ", "3 \nfeedback. \n \n9.  Output  3:  Review.  To  further  shape  and  expand  the  website  with  demand  driven \nfeatures a review will take place at the end of year one. This will be used to continue with the \ndesign  sprint  exercise  (website  prototype,  live  proof  of  concept  to  captive  audience),  the \ntechnology operating model,7 and the business case8 to be able to decide what interactive \nfeatures the website should have and discuss how ADB.org can support these and whether \nthere is a need to set up an independent website or remain within ADB.org. These decisions will \nbe taken in coordination with PSOD, DOC and ITD. During the year, feedback will be collected \nthrough interaction with subscribers and social media contacts, as well as surveys with partner \nfinancial institutions and research (carried out during the design sprint exercise). \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $200,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by TASF \u2013 Donor Contribution, and $400,000 by TASF \u2013 Income Transfer. The \nfunds will cover website development, IT infrastructure (as necessary), preparation, layout and \ndesign of content material, conference-related (seminar) expenses, remuneration, travel, and \nper diem for international/national consultants, and miscellaneous expenses.  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB  will  administer  Subproject  1  and  its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department, \nFinancial Institutions Division, will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants in collaboration \nwith Department of Communication.  \n \nTable 1: Subproject 1 Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  2021-2023  \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing  PSOD, PSFI \nagencies \nKey Consultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n(additional resources  Design and Social  Individual Consultant  ADB, Subproject 1 \nwill be identified as  Media Consultant  Selection Method \nper requirements)  Business and  Individual Consultant  ADB, Subproject 1 \nContent Manager  Selection Method \nDigital Content  Individual Consultant  ADB, Subproject 1 \nCurator  Selection Method \nWeb layout and  Shopping/RFQ Procedure  ADB, Subproject 1 \ngraphic design  \nProject Coordinator  Individual Consultant  ADB, Subproject 1 \nSelection Method \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or  The TA website hosted by ADB shall be deactivated by the Department of \ndisposal arrangement  Communication and/or Office of Information Systems and Technology  within \nupon TA completion  3 months after TA completion date on the condition that there are no plans to \n \n7  Including necessary software, such as e.g. a marketplace software. \n8  This will include sustainability aspects of the Marketplace which will be further refined in subproject 4.
