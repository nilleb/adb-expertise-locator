INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Rapid population and economic growth in Asia and the Pacific continue to create high \nlevels of demand for energy and electricity. Given the increasing scale of energy and electricity \nuse, about 800 million people still have no access to basic electricity services in Asia and the \nPacific.1 Now and in the foreseeable future, the increasing trend and pattern of energy use are \nexpected  to  create  far-reaching  environmental  consequences  such  as  climate  change. \nAchieving energy security, mitigating the impacts of climate change, and improving energy \naccess for all will require a strong and more responsive energy sector to deliver structural as \nwell as policy reforms to boost power sector development\u2014toward achieving more inclusive and \nenvironmentally sustainable economic growth.  \n \n2.  In the last 40 years, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing assistance \nto  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  the  energy  sector,  particularly  on  power \nexpansion programs and infrastructure, institutional capacity building, power sector reforms, \ngovernance,  and  efficiency  improvements.  Promotion  of  institutional  and  policy  reforms  to \nenhance the operational efficiency and sustainability of energy operations and infrastructure in \nthe DMCs is among the core areas of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.2 In support of this framework, \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy3 considered energy sector reform, capacity building, and governance as \nimportant pillars in helping DMCs provide reliable, adequate, and affordable energy to achieve \ninclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way.  \n \n3.  In light of this, the technical assistance (TA) aims to review and conduct an assessment \nof the ongoing power sector reform in Asia and the Pacific. It will evaluate the outcomes of \nreforms in at least three countries4 in the region and build on relevant ADB project experiences \nand research outputs on power sector reforms5 to provide insight toward more effective policy \nand an improved regulatory and operational environment for power sector development in the \nDMCs. In consultation with the regional departments, the Energy CoP, and other departments, \nthe concept paper prepared for the TA was approved on 19 September 2011 by ADB\u2019s vice-\npresident (knowledge management and sustainable development). The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1 Asian Development Bank\u2019s Energy for All Initiative. http://beta.adb.org/sectors/energy/programs/energy-for-all-\ninitiative \n2 ADB. 2008.

Although countries in Asia and the Pacific have been undertaking power sector reforms \nduring in the last 20 years, results have been mixed in terms of physical, economic, and \ninstitutional milestones, particularly in the areas of market structure, private participation, and \nregulatory framework. Most have generally been tentative and incomplete, and remain works in \nprogress. The reform initiatives have mainly been focused on institutions and processes that \ninfluence the relationship between power utilities and the public sector; the limited efficiency of \npublic sector management, accountability, legal framework, and information flows have often \nresulted to inadequate services and incentives to meet consumer demands efficiently. Although \nthe importance of institutions and their  undertakings have emerged amid large investment \nneeds in the power sector, the sector has yet to create an enabling environment in which \ninvestors  and  operators  can  face  reasonable  commercial  risks,  and  in  which  consumers, \nregulators, and other stakeholders honor the contractual rights of power suppliers to recover \ntheir revenues. This has discouraged private sector investment in the power sector.  \n5.  Countries in Asia and the Pacific looked at successful experiences of sector reform from \ncountries  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  like \nAustralia and the  United Kingdom, in terms of effective privatization and competition in the \npower sector, through radical market liberalization\u2014both in the wholesale and retail markets for \nelectricity. This has resulted in improved performance of their power sectors (i.e., reduced \nsupply costs, high service quality, improved investment decisions, and innovation in supplying \ncustomers). Building on the success of OECD experiences, many Asian countries over the last \n20 years have started to initiate power sector reform to address key reform challenges such as: \n(i) weak initial starting conditions of reform implementation; (ii) power market restructuring in the \nelectricity supply industry, where large state-owned structures remain technically lacking under \nvertically  integrated  systems;  (iii)  less  developed  power  sector  with  limited  power  supply \ncapacity;  (iv)  fiscal  pressure,  in  particular,  disenchantment  with  the  poor  performance  of \npublicly-owned  utilities;  (v)  rapid  power  demand  growth\u2014including  demand  for  access  to \nelectricity supply from currently unconnected households\u2014which offer unfavorable conditions \nfor  restructuring,  in  turn,  allowing  insufficient  time  for  introducing  reform;  and  (vi)  weak \ngovernance of the power market. \n6.  Since the power sector will continue to play a key role in the region\u2019s rapid economic \ngrowth,  it  is  highly  relevant  to  revisit  and  assess  the  power  sector  reform  developments, \ndetermine the relative success and performances of some selected countries in achieving the \ntargeted reform outcomes, and draw lessons for knowledge sharing that can improve reform \nplanning perspectives among other developing countries in the region. Questions that remain to \nbe answered are: (i) how successful the reforms have been and (ii) whether the reforms have \ncontributed to the power sector development in the region. Moreover, it is necessary to address \nshortcomings in terms of policies and their implementation that need to be overcome going \nforward.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The TA project will review and assess ongoing power sector reform in selected DMCs in \nAsia and the Pacific, where the power sector development agenda (i) remains high in the \ndevelopment  strategy  and  policy  priorities  of  the  national  government;  (ii)  has  achieved \nsignificant physical, economic, and institutional reform milestones that have demonstrated either \n ", "  3 \nsuccessful outcomes or generated relevant experiences and lessons useful for other ADB \nmember countries to learn from; and (iii) has continued to support ongoing reform objectives \ntargeted to achieve improved power sector development.  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be successful power sector reform that will bring reliable, accessible, and \nsecure  power  supply  to  DMCs  toward  achieving  environmentally  sustainable  and  inclusive \neconomic growth. The outcome  will  be  the formulation  of  effective  policies  and  regulatory \nmeasures, leading to an improved operational environment for the power sector of DMCs.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will deliver three main outputs: (i) a comprehensive assessment of the power \nsector reform agenda of the participating DMCs, (ii) knowledge sharing and policy dialogues \namong various stakeholders, and (iii) dissemination workshops.  \n10.  Assessment of the power sector reforms. A comprehensive assessment of the power \nsector reform agenda of each of the participating DMCs will be conducted to bring out the \nissues and major challenges that have undermined the pursuit of sustainable power sector \ndevelopment. The assessment will also serve as guidelines to government or policy makers for \nbetter planning and formulation of long-term energy policy and strategies. Since each of the \ncountry experiences in power sector reform may be unique and country-specific, the study will \nbe  conducted  in  collaboration  with  the  national  government,  local  research  institutes,  and \ndevelopment partners.  \n11.  The assessment will have two components. The first component will constitute an overall \nreview of the ongoing power sector reform to provide insights on the progress and its pattern in \nlight of sustainable power sector development. It will conduct a comprehensive literature review \nand  scoping  work  to  examine  the  driving  forces  of  the  power  sector  reform  and  assess \nimplementation experiences in selected countries. The review will include key aspects such as \ninstitution building, the regulatory framework, structural and functional unbundling of the power \nsector, deregulation, private sector participation, and tariff settings. The second component will \nassess the advantages and disadvantages of different reform models of ongoing power sector \nreform in selected DMCs to address the effects on power sector development; and evaluate the \noutcomes  of  the  power  sector  reform  using  several  social,  economic,  and  environmental \nperformance parameters for sustainable energy development. Details are in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The findings will inform about the impacts of reform on power sector development and \nidentify the existing issues, challenges and constraints for further reform as well as discuss \npolicy implications. The findings from this TA are expected to provide a benchmark for DMCs\u2019 \ndecision makers seeking to identify options based on their own policy contexts, priorities, and \nneeds.  \n \n13.  Knowledge sharing. During implementation, the TA will facilitate knowledge sharing \nand policy dialogue through local and regional consultation workshops. This output will bring \ntogether  various  stakeholders  to  discuss  key  issues,  challenges,  and  experiences  in \nundertaking power sector reforms as well as highlight best practices and lessons learned. \n \n14.  Dissemination workshops.  Key findings of the study will be disseminated through \npublic  seminars,  workshops,  and  roundtable  discussions  aimed  at  reaching  relevant  policy \n ", "4   \nmakers and other national agencies in the countries covered by this TA, as well as in other \nDMCs. Key findings and lessons from this TA are expected to provide DMCs with relevant \ninsights and information that can contribute to their power sector planning and decision making, \nand provide guidance to ADB\u2019s regional and country energy operations.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $ 714,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  Details  of  the  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. TA fund disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance  Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB, through the Economics and Research Department, will be the executing agency \nfor the TA. The TA will be implemented from November 2011 to March 2014, in coordination \nwith ADB regional departments and in partnership with representatives from the governments, \nthe private sector, academe, and multilateral organizations.  \n17.  The TA will require the services of individual international and national consultants. The \nrecruitment of individual consultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will require 14 person-months of \ninternational and 54 person-months of national consulting input. The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The Economics and Research Department will report on the progress of the TA through \nregular updates on the project information documents. The key findings of the TA will be \ndisseminated through seminars, workshops, and media.   \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.
