Rapid development in Indonesia has given rise to large quantities of waste, the disposal \nand management of which is an environmental challenge. Appropriately managed, waste can \nbe a source of energy while adverse environmental impacts are mitigated. To evaluate this \npotential, during the 2002 Country Programming Mission the Government requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to include in the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2003\u20132005 an \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) on gas generation from waste. From 29 September to 3 \nOctober 2003, therefore, ADB fielded a Fact-Finding Mission to prepare the TA paper on Gas \nGeneration from Waste Project.1 The Mission and Government reached an understanding on \nthe goals, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the TA.2  The TA logical framework is in Appendix 1, and an initial poverty and \nsocial analysis in Appendix 2. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Growth  and  development  in  any  economy  often  give  rise  to  waste  disposal  and \nmanagement problems. In Indonesia, acceleration of urban settlement and industrial growth has \nalso resulted in production of solid and liquid wastes that contaminate the soil and groundwater, \nand in emissions of harmful gases. The uncontrolled decomposition of organic waste under \nanaerobic conditions produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas causing global warming. \nHowever, methane from waste can be captured to provide a renewable source of energy and, in \nthe process, help abate the enhanced greenhouse effect. Other waste products can also be \nused in an environmentally benign manner to generate energy and other useful material such as \nfertilizers. The World Bank has an adaptable loan program3 in Indonesia to manage urban \nwaste and convert it to compost. Yet, waste from important agro-industries in remote and rural \nsettings\u2014the palm oil industry, for example\u2014contributes to local and global environmental \npollution, and is not covered by the World Bank program.  \n \n3.  Indonesia is the second largest producer, after Malaysia, of palm oil in the world. In \nIndonesia over 3 million hectares are under palm oil plantations, which provide inputs to a large \nnumber of palm oil mills (POMs). It is estimated that there are nearly 300 mills, of which 240 are \nin Sumatra and 40 in Kalimantan. New POMs are being planned to meet the shortage of milling \ncapacity and rising production of palm oil. The Indonesia palm oil industry produces over 4,000 \nmillion tons (t) of palm oil, providing over $1 billion in export earnings,4 and directly and indirectly \nproviding livelihood to a large number of rural people.  \n \n4.  POMs produce significant amounts of biomass waste and generate large quantities of \nwastewater. Now, wastewater from POMs is discarded in waste disposal ponds, resulting in \nleaching of contaminants that pollute the groundwater and soil, and in the release of methane \ngas. Almost all POM waste can be processed to produce energy and fertilizer. Processing \nincludes capture of methane, which is a potential source of clean and renewable energy for \nremote locations. Wastewater has some crude palm oil that can be recovered to produce bio-\ndiesel. Solid waste from POMs, in the form of fresh fruit bunches, can be converted to energy or \n                                                 \n1  The Mission comprised S. Gupta, project economist (energy), Southeast Asia Infrastructure Division.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 September 2003. \n3  World Bank. 2001.

Given the economic importance of this agro-industry, it is imperative to minimize \nadverse environmental impacts and for the industry to operate on a sustainable basis. \n \n5.  The national energy policy aims to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by developing and \nusing indigenous new and renewable energy resources. Biomass is a renewable source of \nenergy that is often used inefficiently. If used efficiently, biomass could provide more energy to \nremote, rural areas. Solid biomass waste and liquid waste from POMs can be transformed into \nelectricity, gas, bio-diesel, and fertilizer, improving use efficiency and substituting fossil fuels. \n \n6.  Public and private POMs lack knowledge and access to suitable waste management, \nfertilizer  production,  bio-diesel  conversion,  and  methane-capture  technologies. POMs  could \nmeet  all  their  energy  requirements  and  produce  surplus  energy.  Despite  being  in  energy-\ndeficient areas, this surplus energy is wasted due to limited opportunities to market it. One POM \nwith the capacity to process 60 tons of fresh fruit bunches per hour could produce 11,400 cubic \nmeters of methane per day from wastewater, and provide over 1.5 megawatts of electricity. Oil \npalm fruits are harvested through out the year, with peak production from July to December, \npotentially ensuring year-round processing and availability of energy. \n \n7.  Integrated waste management will enable POMs\u2019 sustainable operation and provide the \nfollowing multifaceted benefits that help improve the quality of life in distant, and often isolated, \nlocations: \n \n(i)  Mitigate  contamination  of  soil  and  groundwater  resulting  from  uncontrolled \ndisposal of POM solid and liquid waste. \n(ii)  Provide a clean, renewable, and local source of energy to remote areas. \n(iii)  Produce organic fertilizers to enhance land productivity. \n(iv)  Reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and contribute to global environmental \nbenefits. \n \n8.  A  debate  is  ongoing  over  the  proliferation  of  palm  oil  plantations,  which  results  in \ndeforestation. However, the issue is beyond the scope of this TA.  \n \n9.  The 2003\u20132005 Country Strategy and Program addresses the main medium-term needs \nof the economy, stressing (i) improvements in governance, (ii) meeting local needs through \ndecentralization, (iii) human development, (iv) environmental management and sustainable use \nof natural resources, and (v) raising long-term growth prospects and economic potential. The TA \nthus  contributes  directly  to  effective  environmental  management  and  sustainable  natural \nresource use as well as indirectly helps meet local needs. The TA will promote the use of clean \nand renewable energy, improve access of remote and rural populations to efficient and modern \nforms  of  energy,  and  enable  environmentally  sustainable  operation  of  an  important  agro-\nindustry. The interventions examined and developed under the TA will encourage public-private \npartnerships and provide simultaneous global and local environmental benefits. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The goal of the TA is to support sustainable development. The purpose of the TA is to (i) \nimprove integrated waste management practices in the palm oil industry and (ii) evaluate the \npotential of POM waste as a renewable and commercially viable source of clean energy. The ", "    3 \nTA will (i) establish a waste management framework for the industry, (ii) conduct a technical and \neconomic assessment of different alternatives for energy recovery and conversion from POM \nwaste, (iii) develop a sustainable plan for effective waste management and energy capture for a \ncluster of public and private sector POMs, (iv) evaluate the potential social and environmental \nbenefits of improved waste management practices, and (v) assess the need for further ADB \nsupport for energy generation from waste. \n \n11.  The deliverables from the TA include (i) review of solid waste management practices in \nthe palm oil sector; (ii) assessment of technologies available for waste management in POMs, \nincluding those for collection and use of methane gas from wastewater; (iii) identification of a \nprocess to facilitate transfer of such technologies; (iv) development of methane recovery and \nuse  from  POM  effluent  as  potential  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  projects;  (v) \nconversion and transmission options for surplus energy from a POM cluster and evaluation of \ntheir viability; and (vi) implementation plan to market surplus energy produced from POM waste. \nDeliverables (v) and (vi) would include preparing a feasibility report on recovering energy from \nPOM  waste  for  a  cluster  of  POM,  including  an  evaluation  of  the  options  to  directly  feed \nrecovered methane into the local gas network, generate electricity for local consumption and/or \nwheel electricity to the grid, or develop a local network to distribute electricity. The TA will also \nassess the impact of suggested interventions on the local population, including indigenous \npeople.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  To achieve the TA objectives, the consultants will review national and international \nwaste management practices in the palm oil industry. Based on the quantity of biomass and \nliquid waste generated by POMs, the TA will undertake a technical and economic evaluation of \ninterventions to minimize adverse environmental impacts and to harness energy from all types \nof waste. The options evaluated will include technologies to convert energy, such as production \nof electricity from biomass waste and methane gas or production of bio-diesel from crude palm \noil  in  wastewater.  The  evaluations  will  provide  the  basis  to  develop  guidelines  for  waste \nmanagement.  \n \n13.  The TA will identify a cluster of POMs that could generate sufficient quantities of energy \n(electricity or gas) from waste, and design systems for in situ and/or local energy use. If surplus \nenergy potential is significant, the TA will propose common off-take systems for the cluster. As \nPOMs are a mix of private, community-managed, and state-owned entities, a model for public-\nprivate  partnership  in  waste  management  and  energy  use  for  POMs,  and  a  plan  to \ncommercialize surplus energy will be prepared. A feasibility study for the interventions, including \na financial and economic analysis, will be undertaken. The TA will require the involvement and \ncooperation  of  local  authorities,  indigenous  people,  POMs,  and  local  subsidiaries  of \nconventional energy suppliers such as the state electricity enterprise (PLN) and state gas \ncorporation (PGN). An important TA component will be the environmental and social analysis, \nand assessment of impact on indigenous people, if any, of the proposed interventions.  \n \n14.  The TA will also help identify the greenhouse gas abatement potential of emissions \ncapture  and  energy  generation  interventions,  and  determine  availability  of  additional \ninternational  resources  under  various  greenhouse  gas  mitigation  initiatives  such  as  CDM. \nDetailed terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising $347,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $278,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, and \n$153,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. Financing for the TA will comprise $250,000 on \na grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and cofinancing of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nbe administered by ADB from the Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change financed by \nthe Government of Canada. The Government of Indonesia will finance the remaining $125,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  As  the  TA  Executing  Agency,  the  Directorate  General  of  Electricity  and  Energy \nUtilization  (DGEEU)  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  TA  management.  PGN  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency.  A  steering  committee  will  be  set  up  to  review  and  advise  on  TA \nimplementation. The committee will be chaired by DGEEU, and consist of representatives from \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  the  state-owned  palm  oil  plantation \ncorporation, PLN or other relevant power transmission and distribution companies, research \ninstitutes, universities, and associations of concerned stakeholders. The PGN development \ndirector will be the project director, responsible for TA implementation. \n  \n17.  The TA will be carried out in 9 months, from September 2004 to May 2005. A consulting \nfirm with expertise in policy analysis and formulation, economic analysis, and energy from \nwaste  will  be  engaged  to  undertake  the  major  TA  components.  Domestic  consultants  or \nresource persons will also be engaged separately as individuals for approximately 5 person-\nmonths. Total consulting services will include 10 person-months of international expertise in \neconomic and financial analysis and in energy conversion technologies; and 20 person-months \nof domestic expertise in social, economic, and environmental impact assessment; anaerobic \ntechnologies; and energy conversion and distribution. All consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Simplified technical proposals \nwill be evaluated using the quality- and cost-based selection method for the consulting firm. \nThe consultants will work closely with DGEEU, and PGN. Equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement, and retained by the Executing Agency upon \nTA completion. The study findings will be disseminated to and discussed with concerned \nstakeholders through workshops and seminars. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change, and (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $250,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia for the Gas Generation from Waste Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n  \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n  \u2022  Improved waste  \u2022  Government statistics   \nSupport sustainable  management practices  \u2022  Government policy \ndevelopment in Indonesia  are adopted.  statements  \n  \u2022  Palm oil mill (POM) \nwaste is used to \nprovide a cleaner \nsource of energy to \npoor and remote \nareas. \n\u2022  Methane from palm oil \nwaste is captured, \nreducing methane \nemissions and their \nnegative impact on \npoor population. \nPurpose       \n  \u2022  Waste management  \u2022  Final report from team  \u2022  Stakeholders and \n1.

Introduction  \n1.  The national energy policy aims to reduce dependence on fossil fuel by developing and \nusing indigenous new and renewable energy resources. Biomass is a renewable energy source \nthat  is  often  used  inefficiently.  If  used  more  efficiently,  biomass  could  meet  the  energy \nrequirements of remote, rural areas. Over 3 million hectares are under palm oil plantations, \nwhich provide inputs to a large number of palm oil mills (POMs), a significant proportion of \nwhich are community-managed. POMs produce solid and liquid waste that can be transformed \ninto electricity, gas, bio-diesel, and fertilizer, substituting the use of fossil fuels. Methane, a \npowerful greenhouse gas, could be used to meet energy requirements. \n \n2.  To meet the objectives set in this Technical Assistance (TA) document, a team of \nconsultants will do the following: \n \n(i)  Review international experience for waste management in the POMs. \n(ii)  Review and develop guidelines for waste management in the palm oil industry. \n(iii)  Determine the quantity of biomass waste and liquid waste generated by POMs. \n(iv)  Identify the size and distribution of POMs and select a cluster to implement a \nsystem to use energy from waste. \n(v)  Determine techniques for use of solid and liquid waste from POMs. \n(vi)  Determine technologies for energy capture from solid and liquid POM waste, \nincluding anaerobic methane from POM wastewater. \n(vii)  Evaluate specific interventions for integrated waste management and energy \nproduction from POM waste. \n(viii)  Evaluate the techno-economic potential for energy production from POM waste, \nincluding bio-diesel from crude palm oil and liquid waste, and its subsequent use. \n(ix)  For  technological  interventions  that  produce  significant  quantities  of  energy, \ndetermine systems for in situ and local use of energy from waste. \n(x)  Undertake  a  feasibility  study  for  the  interventions,  including  a  financial  and \neconomic analysis. \n(xi)  Determine  a  model  for  public-private  partnership  in  waste  management  and \nenergy use for POMs and develop an action plan to commercialize the use of \nenergy from POMs. \n(xii)  Identify the greenhouse gas abatement potential of methane capture and energy-\ngeneration  interventions  and  determine  availability  of  additional  international \nresources under various greenhouse gas mitigation initiatives such as the clean \ndevelopment mechanism (CDM). \n(xiii)  Undertake an environmental and social analysis and determine the impact on \nindigenous people, if any. \n \n3.
