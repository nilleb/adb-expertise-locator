This  is  an  eligible  transaction  under  the  Faster  Approach  to  Small  Nonsovereign \nTransactions (FAST) framework.1 The transaction involves an equity investment of up to $10 \nmillion equivalent in Hong Kong dollars2 in China Everbright Greentech Limited (CEGL) at a price \nno higher than HK$6.67 per share for China Everbright Renewable Energy Project in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. To address severe air, water, and land pollution across the PRC, \nthe country\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 calls for more stringent environmental protection \nmeasures  and  a  supportive  regulatory  framework  for  renewables.3 In  response,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  focused  its  business  development  efforts  in  the  PRC  on \nenvironmental infrastructure. Through ongoing discussions with stakeholders, the project team \nhas identified emerging market demand for ADB to support the environmental infrastructure arms \nof state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in accessing international capital markets by strengthening \ncorporate governance and environmental management systems. This facilitates SOE reform and \nenhances transparency.  \n \n3.  Among  a  wide  range  of  opportunities,  the  project  team  selected  China  Everbright \nInternational Limited\u2019s spin-off listing of CEGL (or the \u201cCompany\u201d) to support agricultural waste-\nto-energy and management of hazardous waste across the PRC. Following the successful \nimplementation of two earlier loan facilities, China Everbright International Limited (CEIL)4 has \nrequested ADB to support the initial public offering (IPO) of CEGL as a cornerstone investor.   \n \n4.  Project  design.  Proceeds  from  the  IPO  will  allow  CEGL  to  (i)  build  and  operate \nagricultural and household waste-to-energy projects (45%); (ii) build and operate hazardous \nwaste treatment projects (35%); (iii) establish an in-house research and development institute to \nimprove  operational  efficiency,  reduce  emissions  and  residues,  and  acquire  advanced \ntechnologies (10%); and (iv) fund working capital (10%). CEGL plans to float 28% of its shares, \nwith CEIL remaining the largest indirect shareholder post-IPO with a 72% stake. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s role. ADB has been requested to participate in the IPO as a cornerstone investor. \nCornerstone investors have played a key role in equity capital markets across Asia and are \nparticularly prominent in Hong Kong, China.5 Aside from facilitating the book-building process, \ncornerstone investments provide a seal of approval on the listing, thereby reassuring other \npotential investors of the merits of the investment. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has issued \nspecific guidance on cornerstone investments, including (i) no material information disclosures to \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Sponsors. Since ADB\u2019s first intervention in 2009, CEIL has grown into an integrated \nenvironmental protection company with 213 projects across the PRC and in select locations \noverseas. CEIL is 41.4% owned by China Everbright (Group), a conglomerate wholly owned by \nthe Government of the PRC through a 44.3% stake held by the Ministry of Finance and a 55.7% \nstake held by Central Huijin Investment, the domestic arm of sovereign wealth fund China \nInvestment Corporation.  \n \n7.  Investee. In 2015, CEIL set a new strategy to further expand the following segments \nthrough CEGL: (i) biomass (agricultural and household waste-to-energy); (ii) hazardous waste \ntreatment (incineration and landfills); and (iii) solar and wind power.  \n \n(i)  Agricultural  and  household waste-to-energy  (81.6%  of  FY2016  revenue). \nCEGL incinerates agricultural and forestry waste and household waste to generate \nelectricity for the grid and heat in the form of steam for industrial customers.6 CEGL \ncurrently has 32 biomass projects, including 7 in operation, 12 under construction, \nand 13 in planning, with aggregate biomass processing designed capacity of \n6,199,800 tons per annum (tpa), aggregate household waste processing designed \ncapacity of 1,387,000 tpa and aggregate generating designed capacity of 682 \nmegawatts (MW).  \n(ii)  Hazardous  waste  treatment  (11.2%  of  FY2016  revenue).  CEGL  provides \nhazardous  waste  treatment  and  disposal  services  to  industrial  and  medical \ncustomers from whom it receives waste treatment fees. CEGL has 22 hazardous \nwaste treatment projects, including 8 in operation, 2 under construction, and 12 in \nplanning with aggregate hazardous waste disposal designed capacity of 504,150 \ntpa. \n(iii)  Solar and wind power (7.2% of FY2016 revenue). CEGL currently operates \nseven solar plants and two wind farms, with aggregate generating designed \ncapacity of 125.9 MW. All electricity generated is sold to the grid at specified on-\ngrid tariffs.   \n \n8.  Historical financial performance. CEGL has grown rapidly across all three business \nsegments. Total revenues were HK$3.0 billion in FY2016, up nearly 150% from HK$1.2 billion in \nFY2015. Biomass revenues rose 158.8% to HK$2.4 billion as new pipeline projects began \nconstruction (net increase of seven projects) and completed projects began operations (net \nincrease of five projects) during FY2016. Hazardous waste treatment revenues grew 104.5% to \nHK$335.8 million on higher waste volume treated and four more projects in operation in FY2016 \ncompared to FY2015. Solar and wind revenues rose 132.1% to HK$215.1 million, reflecting the \nstart of commercial operations of two wind projects in September 2015. The Company reported \nnet income of HK$629.5 million, up 131.9% from FY2015. Gross profit margin was 33% and net \nprofit margin was 21% in FY2016. Total assets as of 31 December 2016 were HK$7.5 billion, up \nfrom HK$5.6 billion at FYE2015. Leverage was moderate, with long-term borrowings at 31% of \nassets at FYE2016.  \n \n                                                \n6  Agricultural and forestry waste includes straw, husks, waste wood and debris from construction and demolition, tree \ntrimmings, and other manufacturing wood waste. CEGL does not develop stand-alone household waste-to-energy \nprojects and instead integrates such projects into its biomass facilities.   ", "  3 \n9.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n10.  Impact. The impact will be mitigated air pollution7 and increased renewable power as a \nshare of total PRC power generation to 27% by 2020.8 \n \n11.  Outcome. The outcome will be improved and increased provision of environmental \nprotection. \n  \n12.   Outputs. The  output  will  be  (i)  increased  biomass  and  household  waste  treatment \ncapacity, (ii) increased biomass and household waste-to-energy generation capacity, and (iii) \nincreased hazardous waste treatment capacity. By 2025, biomass treatment capacity of at least \n11 million tpa, household waste treatment capacity of at least 1.4 million tpa, biomass and \nhousehold waste-to-energy generation capacity of at least 1,162 MW, and hazardous waste \ntreatment capacity of at least 0.7 million tpa will be developed. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n13.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure and the environment as two of ADB\u2019s four \nstrategic priorities.9 With regard to infrastructure, the project is aligned with the midterm review\u2019s \nfocus on waste management, as well as its emphasis on public\u2013private partnership. With regard \nto  the  environment,  the  project  mitigates  air  pollution  and  health  threats  and  promotes \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \n \n14.  Consistency with country strategy. By supporting environmental sustainability, the \nproject directly addresses key development goals of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the \nPRC,  and  aligns  with  the  strategy\u2019s  sector  priority  of  pollution  control. 10  Environmental \nsustainability will continue to be a major strategic objective of ADB support to the PRC, as will the \nPRC\u2019s  delivery  of  environmental,  regional,  and  global  public  goods.  The  project  strongly \ncomplements ADB\u2019s East Asia Department\u2019s on-going initiatives in pollution mitigation projects.11 \n \n15.  Consistency with sector strategy. The project is consistent with ADB's Energy Policy.12 \nUnder  the  policy,  ADB\u2019s  investments  will  focus  on  renewable  energy  projects,  as  well  as \nexpansion of energy access. The policy states that support for renewable energy projects will be \nprioritized and broadened, with an objective to create a framework that makes investing in \nrenewable energy commercially viable. The policy envisages that, in the process of facilitating \ndirect private sector investments in renewable energy, ADB will assume greater risks and act as \na catalyst for investments that the private sector might not otherwise be willing to make. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n                                                \n7  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2013.

Table 1 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Of CEGL\u2019s 63 projects in operation, construction or planning, 54 are build\u2013own\u2013\noperate and 7 are build\u2013operate\u2013transfer concession arrangements with local \ngovernments.a Each party\u2019s rights and obligations are stipulated in the investment or \nconcession  agreement,  including  priority  or  exclusive  rights  to  operate  in  a \ndesignated area.b CEGL is responsible for designing, financing, constructing, and \noperating all  project  facilities  subject  to meeting  performance  benchmarks as \nstipulated in the agreements. Local governments are responsible for facilitating land \nuse rights and construction certificates, and assisting in procuring all necessary \nproject approvals. For biomass projects, local governments are required to assist \nCEGL in securing biomass supply and arranging logistics, grid connection, and \nofftake. For household waste-to-energy, agreements specify the minimum amount \nof household waste and the waste treatment fee per ton as well as the pricing \nadjustment mechanism. For hazardous waste treatment, agreements with industrial \nand medical customers stipulate a minimum amount of waste to be delivered and \ntreated each year.  \nConstruction arrangements   CEGL oversees all aspects of project construction and selects independent third-\nparty  subcontractors  in  a  transparent  manner  through  competitive  bidding. \nConstruction typically takes 2\u201318 months on average depending on project scope \nand location.  \nTechnology  CEGL utilizes both water-cooled vibrating moving grate boilers and circulating \nfluidized bed boilers in its biomass and household waste-to-energy plants. The \nhazardous  waste  treatment business  employs  different treatment  technologies \ndepending on the nature of the waste. The Company uses crystalline silicon and \nthin-film amorphous silicon panels in its solar projects and double-fed asynchronous \nturbines in its wind projects.  \nOperations arrangements    \nRevenue structure  CEGL enters into power purchase agreements with state or local grid companies (1\u2013\n5-year terms with renewal options); household waste treatment agreements with \nlocal governments; steam supply agreements with industrial companies (1-year \nterms with renewal options); and hazardous waste treatment agreements with \nindustrial companies,  medical  institutions,  and  clinics.  The  purchase  price  for \nelectricity is fixed for CEGL\u2019s current biomass (CNY0.75 per kWh); household waste-\nto-energy  (CNY0.65  per  kWh  subject  to  adjustment  based  on  output);  solar \n(CNY1.00 per kWh, CNY1.70 per kWh, CNY2.40 per kWh and CNY3.00 per kWh); \nand wind projects (CNY0.61 per kWh). For integrated biomass and household waste-\nto-energy projects, the Company also receives fixed fees from local governments \nper ton of household waste treated. Household waste treatment fees are negotiated \nwith local governments, with adjustments based on consumer and producer price \nindices. Steam price is generally determined by the relevant local government and \nis subject to adjustments.c Hazardous waste treatment fees are based on fee \nguidance from the local government and are subject to adjustments for inflation and \nmarket conditions. Waste treatment fees may also vary according to waste type, \ndifficulty  of  treatment,  and  landfill  requirements,  and  they  range  from  under \nCNY2,000 per ton to approximately CNY13,000 per ton. All fees are paid on a \nmonthly  basis.  Under  some  agreements,  such  as  medical  waste  treatment \nagreements, customers pay a fixed lump-sum waste treatment fee annually.   \nMajor cost structure  CEGL  has  established  a  comprehensive  biomass  supply  network  covering \n  collection, transport, storage, and utilization. It oversees collection and storage \nacross different counties in the same region through two regional management \ncenters in Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, through which it can centrally manage and \nallocate biomass supply to  its projects. Biomass supply is sourced though a \ncombination of third-party brokers and individual farmers. As of December 2016, \nCEGL had 823 biomass brokers, of which 54 have entered into written supply ", "  5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nagreements with guaranteed minimum quantity and quality commitments. These \nagreements, which typically have a 1-year term, also specify types of biomass and \npermitted areas of collection. Price is based on a fixed unit price and weight, with \nadjustments made for quality, e.g., moisture and ash content. Purchases from other \nsuppliers such as smaller brokers and individual farmers are made according to \nCEGL\u2019s written biomass procurement and settlement policies. Suppliers transport \nbiomass raw materials to CEGL facilities or collection points at their own cost. \nHousehold waste supply is provided directly by the local government. For medical \nhazardous waste, CEGL collects the hazardous waste from customers directly or \nfrom storage sites managed by customers.  Qualified third-party transportation \nservice providers collect and deliver all other types of hazardous waste. \nOperation and maintenance  CEGL continuously monitors its biomass and integrated biomass and household \nwaste-to-energy facilities, and maintains equipment, primarily boilers, on a regular \n3\u20136-month cycle. CEGL conducts repairs as well as preemptive overhauls when \nscreening flags significant changes in equipment condition. Such overhauls typically \nrequire the entire unit to be shut down for more than 20 days.  For its hazardous \nwaste treatment projects, CEGL conducts periodic overhauls of incineration systems \nand flue gas treatment systems to ensure stable operation and compliance with \nrelevant emission standards. It also monitors landfills to identify and prevent leakage. \nIn solar, CEGL can control operation through a remote monitoring system and \nconduct regular inspections and maintenance of solar equipment, primarily cleaning \nof solar panels at night or during periods of lower electricity production. For wind, \nCEGL  uses  a  centralized  control  system  to  monitor  operation  of  its  turbine \ngenerators, allowing for off-site operation and supervision.  \nkWh = kilowatt-hour \na  The two remaining projects comprise acquisitions of (i) a hazardous waste treatment project in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (Lianyungang Hazardous Waste Incineration Project, Phase 1), and (ii) a ground solar project in Germany \n(German Ground Solar Energy Project). \nb  In the case of hazardous waste treatment, the Company enjoys exclusive rights, with land use rights over landfills \nranging from 30 years to 50 years. \nc  CEGL\u2019s steam supply prices range from CNY220 per ton to CNY240 per ton. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; CEGL. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  ADB will invest in CEGL in the amount of $10 million equivalent in Hong Kong dollars at a \nprice no higher than HK$6.67 per share. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n  \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n18.  There is emerging market demand for ADB to prepare the environmental infrastructure \narms  of  major  SOEs  to  access  international  capital  markets  through  pre-IPO  finance  and \nenvironmental and social management system improvements. Since its first waste-to-energy \nproject in 2009, ADB\u2019s intervention with CEIL has played an important role not only in providing \ndirect  financing,  but  also  in  attracting  third-party  financiers  to  CEIL.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED]. Moreover, ADB\u2019s support is expected to establish more confidence \nin environmental infrastructure entities\u2019 future access to international capital markets. Finally, \nADB\u2019s presence as an investor will ensure the continuation at CEGL of the environmental and \nsocial safeguards standards instituted by ADB at CEIL. \n \n ", "6   \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n19.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS 2009), the project is classified \nas category B for environment, category B for involuntary resettlement, and category C for \nindigenous  peoples.  As  the  proposed  ADB  investment  is  not  earmarked  for  any  specific \nsubprojects, the requirement for general corporate finance projects will apply. The proceeds of \nADB\u2019s investment will be applied to non-category A projects. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \nDELETED] Impacts principally involve air, noise and displacement during construction and air, \nwater and soil during operation. Impact assessments and management plans are prepared \nfollowing CEGL policies and procedures that meet national requirements and the SPS. Both CEIL \nand CEGL ESHS teams have proven capacity to identify, mitigate, and manage the environmental \nand social impacts and risks associated with CEGL projects. CEGL will report annually to ADB \non its subproject portfolio ESMS performance and semi-annually at the subproject level as \nrequired. \n \n20.   CEGL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.13 The investee will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, and (ii) \nthe  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will  be \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n21.  CEGL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n22.  The proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n23.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),14 \nADB will proceed with the assistance upon establishing that the Government of the PRC has no \nobjection to the assistance to CEGL. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n24.
