The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the United Nations Convention to \nCombat Desertification (UNCCD), an international treaty aimed at fighting land degradation and \npoverty in dryland areas. Since 1999, ADB has been a member of the Facilitation Committee of \nthe  Global  Mechanism  (GM)1 of  the  UNCCD.  The  GM\u2019s  mandate  is  to  promote  effective \nmobilization and use of resources for UNCCD implementation. In close collaboration with other \nmembers, the GM assists developing member countries in implementing the UNCCD. ADB\u2019s \nregional technical assistance (TA) for combating desertification in Asia2 has supported the \nformulation and implementation of national action plans to fight desertification in arid, semiarid, \nand dry subhumid regions.  \n \n2.  ADB was instrumental in the development of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and \nGlobal Environment Facility (GEF) Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, \nwhich was approved in 2002.3 Subsequently, GEF, members of the Strategic Partnership for \nUNCCD Implementation in Central Asian Countries (SPA),4 and countries of Central Asia asked \nADB to develop a similar partnership for Central Asia. The Central Asian Countries Initiative for \nLand  Management  (CACILM)  is  under  GEF\u2019s  Operational  Program  on  Land  Degradation \n(OP15).5 In  February  2004,  ADB  led  a  consultation  mission  comprising  multiple  funding \nagencies  to  all  Central  Asian  Countries  (CACs)\u2014Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan and cochaired with the GM a workshop in Almaty for the CACs \nand  funding  agencies.  The  workshop  culminated  in  the  agreement  to  move  forward  with \nCACILM  as  a  partnership  among  multiple  countries  and  funding  agencies  to  support  the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  national  programming  frameworks  (NPF)  for  more \ncomprehensive and integrated approaches to sustainable land management in the region. The \nmeeting also produced an agreement to establish a task force, comprising representatives of \nthe CACs and funding agencies, and to review the concept note and program development \nfacility (PDF) application to GEF. Chaired by ADB, the task force also is  to facilitate the design \nof CACILM. In May 2004, GEF approved a concept note to proceed with a PDF application for \ncofinancing the design of CACILM. The task force held its initial meeting on 23\u201324 August 2004 \nto discuss a draft PDF application, and agreed on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, \nbudget, and implementation arrangements. GEF approved the PDF application for $700,000 on \n31 January 2005.

", "2 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Land degradation7 is a serious economic, social, and environmental problem in the \ntransition economies of the CACs. It directly affects the livelihood of the rural population by \nreducing the productivity of land resources and undermining the stability, functions of, and \nservices derived from natural systems. Agricultural yields reportedly declined by 20\u201330% across \nthe region since these countries achieved independence more than a decade ago, causing as \nmuch as $2 billion in annual losses in agricultural production. The causes of land degradation \nare multiple and complex, and vary across these countries. However, they are attributed largely \nto the abuse and overexploitation of natural resources, particularly through inappropriate and \nunsustainable agricultural practices such as overgrazing, deforestation, and forest degradation. \nNatural disasters often exacerbate the impact of such practices.  \n \n4.  The principal forms and causes of land degradation across the CACs include: (i) erosion, \nsalinization, and water logging; (ii) deteriorating fertility of pasture land; (iii) decreased fertility of \nthe arable drylands of the steppes; (iv) decreased area and productivity of forests; (v) on-site \nand off-site impacts of mining operations; (vi) exacerbated risks from landslides and flooding \ndue to poor watershed management; (vii) reduced stability and functioning of desert, mountain, \nwetland,  and  riparian  ecosystems;  and  (viii)  inadequate  and  incorrect  assessment  and \nmonitoring of land degradation. \n \n5.  Efforts to address land degradation generally have had limited success due to: (i) the \nfocus on technical solutions; (ii) the lack of coordination across agencies; (iii) inadequate policy, \nlegislation, regulation, and incentives for sustainable development; and (iv) inadequate attention \nto  economic  and  social  implications,  and  the  incidence  of  poverty.  The  implementation  of \nmeasures to control and reverse land degradation through more comprehensive and integrated \napproaches to sustainable land management would generate multiple benefits at local, national, \nand global levels. \n \n6.  Recognizing the challenges of implementing sustainable land management initiatives, \nthe GM spearheaded the formulation of the SPA. In mid-2003, the SPA convened a partnership-\nbuilding forum in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, bringing together relevant national actors and funding \nagencies to identify the challenges and opportunities for addressing land degradation issues. \nThe forum generated the Tashkent Joint Platform of Action for UNCCD Implementation, as well \nas the call to establish in each CAC a working group on partnership development for UNCCD \nimplementation. The working groups were established in all of the CACs, and comprise a wide \nrange  of  national  actors,  including  line  ministries,  civil  society  organizations,  and  funding \nagencies. \n \n7.  The involvement of GEF, through OP15, is expected to catalyze the mobilization of the \npolitical  will  and  financial  resources  needed  to  address  these  problems  effectively,  and  to \nachieve incremental global benefits. During the proposed 10-year program, as much as $100 \nmillion in grant funds, depending on the availability of replenishments of GEF, are anticipated to \nbe available. \n \n                                                 \n7\n  Land degradation is defined by GEF as \u201c...any form of deterioration of the natural potential of land that affects \necosystem integrity either in terms of reducing its sustainable ecological productivity or in terms of its native \nbiological richness and maintenance of resilience.\u201d Cited in GEF. 2003. Operational Program on Sustainable Land \nManagement (OP 15). ", "    3 \n8.  Given the region\u2019s high vulnerability to land degradation, and the progress in partnership \nformation with the SPA\u2019s support, the CACs are positioned well to cooperate with GEF\u2019s OP15 \nin developing an initiative to promote additional measures for addressing land degradation in the \nregion. Such an initiative would support: (i) incorporating sustainable land management into \nnational development planning processes; (ii) encouraging the adoption of integrated natural \nresource management; (iii) building synergies between the environment and other sectors of the \neconomy; and (iv) consolidating and coordinating external financing, while reducing transaction \ncosts through the streamlining of partner\u2019s project cycle procedures, among other activities. \nSources of external assistance, including GEF resources, can be more efficiently and effectively \nallocated to maximize the cost effectiveness of scarce development funds. CACILM will also \nbring benefits to the CACs by supporting the active exchange of knowledge, experience and \nlessons, expertise, and training.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The goal of this program is to combat land degradation and improve rural livelihoods in \nthe CACs. The objective is to establish CACILM as a partnership among countries and funding \nagencies to support the development and implementation of NPFs for more comprehensive and \nintegrated approaches to sustainable land management in the region. \n \n10.  The TA has four outputs: (i) NPFs for each country, including a prioritized program of \nprojects and technical assistance, and related concept papers; (ii) the CACILM partnership brief \nand  supporting  GEF  documentation,  prepared  in  accordance  with  GEF  guidelines  on  the \nprogrammatic approach; (iii) established mechanisms for consultation and coordination within \nand between countries that enhance the participation of all stakeholders; provide efficient and \neffective  mechanisms  for  the  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  CACILM;  and \nenhance harmonization of funding agencies; and (iv) increased awareness and commitments by \nnational and funding agency stakeholders. Key stakeholders in each country will be fully aware \nof the partnership approach, and its advantages and disadvantages. Further, they will commit to \ntheir respective responsibilities to address land degradation in a comprehensive and integrated \nmanner.  Commitments  from  key  stakeholders  and  development  partners  will  be  required \nthroughout implementation, with more specific commitments for the first 2 years. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The underlying focus of the approach is to maintain the integrity of this CAC initiative by \nfacilitating and strengthening country ownership and drivenness, expanding and deepening \nstakeholder  participation,  and  facilitating  an  expanded  and  transparent  dialogue  with \ndevelopment partner agencies. \n \n12.  This approach is to be achieved principally by: (i) ensuring that key national stakeholders \nare fully aware of CACILM and its preparation at all times; (ii) the national working groups\u2019 \nproviding the principal entry point for project activities; (iii) extending participation from national \nagencies to communities and land users directly affected by land degradation; and (iv) the task \nforce\u2019s providing the required oversight on progress and transparency, and dialogue between \nrepresentatives of the CACs and the partner aid agencies. \n \n13.  The strong participatory approach envisaged for the Project will include regular task \nforce  meetings,  with  at  least  one  meeting  in  each  of  the  five  CACs;  two  multi-country ", "4 \nworkshops;  national  workshops;  and  regular  working  group  meetings  in  each  country.  In \naddition, national workshops, group interviews, and surveys will form part of an increased and \nsustained  effort  to  engage  the  private  sector,  additional  elements  of  civil  society,  and \ncommunities and land users directly affected by land degradation in each country. A stakeholder \nparticipation plan will be prepared at TA commencement to define more precisely the activities \nto broaden stakeholder involvement. \n \n14.  The key activities include: (i) increasing the awareness of national stakeholders, and \nagreeing on the implementation approach at national workshops in each country; (ii) reviewing \nand  analyzing  the  incorporation  of  sustainable  land  management  into  policy,  legislation, \nplanning, and budgeting; capacity and institutional arrangements; and the current and planned \nTA and investments in sustainable land management; (iii) preparing NPFs for each country, and \nreviewing and discussing them through national and multi-country workshops; (iv) preparing the \nCACILM  partnership  agreement,  and  reviewing  and  discussing  it  through  multi-country \nworkshops  and  task  force  meetings;  and  (v)  agreeing  on  coordination  arrangements  with \ngovernment and funding agency partners, as well as the monitoring and evaluation mechanism \nof the NPFs and the CACILM partnership agreement. The CACILM partnership agreement will \ncover the five CACs and funding agency partners, including GEF. This agreement, together with \nthe NPFs, will determine indicative allocations of GEF resources for TA and investments in \nsustainable land management activities. As an executing agency of GEF, ADB\u2014along with \nWorld Bank, UNDP, and UNEP\u2014is expected to receive substantial resources from GEF to \nsupport ADB\u2019s TA and lending program in the CACs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million. ADB will provide a grant of $500,000 through its \nTA funding program. GEF and GM will provide grants of $700,000 and $50,000, respectively, \nboth  of  which  ADB  will  administer.  The  governments  will  finance  $250,000  through  their: \n(i) provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and  facilities;  (ii)  data  and  documents;  and \n(iii) participation in workshops. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The  countries  that  will  be  involved  in  the  TA  are  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The TA is expected to commence in April 2005, and \nbe completed in December 2005. \n \n17.  The Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Division of East and Central Asia \nDepartment will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB will continue to chair the task force, \nwhich will meet at least three times during the study. In each country, the UNCCD working \ngroups will collect and organize information, coordinate with the consulting team, and facilitate \nworkshops and government approvals. These working groups are attached to relevant agencies \nin each country: Ministry of Environmental Protection (Kazakhstan); Kyrgyz Research Institute, \nMinistry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Processing Industry (Kyrgyz Republic); State \nCommittee for Land Management (Tajikistan); National Institute of Deserts, Flora and Fauna, \nMinistry  of  Nature  Protection  (Turkmenistan);  and  Hydrometerological  Research  Institute \n(Uzbekistan). Development partners under the SPA will participate in national and multi-country \nworkshops and task force meetings, and exchange information on the respective strategies and \nprograms  in  each  country.  Substantial  material  is  available,  which  has  been  used  in  the \npreparation of country reports under the TA on combating desertification in Asia, and for ADB\u2019s ", "    5 \ncountry environmental assessments. The NPF\u2019s will be based on these documents and the \nnational action plan of each country.  \n \n18.  Up to 25 person-months of international consultants and 125 person-months of domestic \nconsultants will be required. The international consultants will include team leader and natural \nresource  management  specialist  (7  person-months),  land  use  specialist  (6),  policy  and \ninstitutions specialist (4), sociologist and gender specialist (2), natural resource economist (3), \nand unallocated (3). The domestic consultants will include deputy team leader and natural \nresource  management  specialist  (8),  policy  and  institutional  specialist  (7),  sociologist  and \ngender specialist (7), and unallocated (15, or 3 person-months per country). The unallocated \nperson-months  are  to  accommodate  additional  expertise  identified  during  the  study,  or \nextensions  of  some  members  of  the  consulting  team\u2019s  expertise,  if  required.  Individual \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nADB and its Borrowers, and other arrangements satisfactory for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 3. Consultants will \npurchase equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. This will include \ncomputer, printer, and fax, and related accessories as required in each country. The equipment \nwill be handed over to the respective agency of the UNCCD working group. \n \n19.  At  least  15  national  workshops,  two  multi-country  workshops,  and  three  task  force \nmeetings  will  be  held  during  the  study.  These  workshops  and  meetings  are  designed  to \nincrease the participation of stakeholders at national, local, and community levels. The aim is for \nstakeholders to monitor the progress of the study, and ultimately to agree on the NPFs and the \nCACILM partnership agreement. \n \n20.  The team leader will be responsible for submission to ADB, GEF, and the task force an \ninception report within 6 weeks of the Project\u2019s initiation, and two bimonthly progress reports \n(within the third and fifth months of the Project, respectively). Rather than dwelling on routine \nactivities, these reports shall provide brief highlights of developments that depart from the \nexpectations, and the remedial steps or adjustments envisaged or made. Another key reporting \nrequirement will be NPFs for each country, which will cover all aspects of the Project that were \nreviewed and analyzed. An initial format for this report will be agreed upon at the first task force \nmeeting, while a revised format will be agreed upon at the first multi-country workshop. The final \nreporting requirement will be the CACILM partnership agreement. Based on the NPFs, this will \ninclude  the  partnership  arrangements  for  cooperation  and  coordination,  as  well  as  an \nimplementation monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The format for this report will be agreed \nupon at the second multi-country workshop. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved: (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by GEF; (ii) ADB administering a portion of technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $50,000 to be financed on a grant basis by GM; and (iii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for Central \nAsian Countries Initiative for Land Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
