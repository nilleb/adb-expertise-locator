The Government of the Maldives requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) for the state-owned enterprises reform project. It is one of the \nimportant  themes  of  the  Government\u2019s  Sixth  National  Development  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  to \nrecognize  the  private  sector  as  the  major  engine  of,  and  partner  for,  national  economic \ndevelopment,  while  the  public  sector\u2019s  role  will  be  rationalized  to  be  a  facilitator  of  the \ndevelopment process.1  \n \n2.  The TA is part of ADB\u2019s support to prepare and implement governance and private \nsector development for the Maldives. A Fact-Finding Mission visited the Maldives in September \n2006  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  purpose,  outputs, \nmethodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference of the TA.2 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  State-owned enterprises (SOEs) play an important role in the country\u2019s economy, given \nthat most large enterprises in the country are in the public sector. Almost all significant sectors \nof  the  economy\u2014including  fisheries,  telecommunications,  civil  aviation,  financial  services, \ntrading, and power\u2014are currently dominated by SOEs. In that profits from SOEs represent a \nsignificant source of revenues for the state, it is essential to ensure that the Government obtains \nadequate returns on the investments made in the SOEs. While the performances of some of the \nSOEs have been satisfactory given the market conditions in which they operate, there are many \nenterprises whose performances have deteriorated over time. The Government has had to \nprovide financial support in the forms of grants, subsidized loans, guarantees, rental subsidies, \nand others to ensure the continuity of their operations.  \n \n4.   Dividends from 21 SOEs to the Government have been in a declining trend and are \nexpected  to  total  Rf398  million  in  2005,  down  by  39%  from  Rf656  million  in  2004.  Five \nenterprises  account  for  more  than  90%  of  the  dividends,3 while  the  others  pay  marginal \ndividends or none at all. The decline in dividends reflects various factors, which may include, in \npart, such shortcomings as  \n \n(i)  Management constraints. Qualified professionals with the required experience will \nneed to be recruited to provide strategic direction for the SOEs\u2019 efficient operations.  \n(ii)  Competition from private sector enterprises. Privatization of SOEs will be needed \nwhere markets are contestable and the greater involvement of the private sector is \nincreasing to the detriment of the SOEs.  \n(iii)  Special  benefits  to  the  SOEs.  Special  protection  has  been  given  to  these \nenterprises, such as below-market land-rental rates and additional financial benefits.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Country Strategy and Program Update (2003\u20132005): Maldives. Manila.  \n2  This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 October 2006. \n3  Dhiraagu, Maldives Airport Company Ltd, State Trading Organization plc, Mal\u00e9 Water & Sewerage Company Ltd, \nand Maldives Port Authority. \n ", "2 \n \n(iv)  Absence  of  independent  pricing  policy.  In  areas  such  as  power  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution, a company like State Electric Corporation Limited \n(STELCO) has limited ability to increase tariffs, and that undermines its profitability.4  \n(v)  Limited funding options for investment plans. In spite of investment plans for \nmodernizing and augmenting capacity, underperforming enterprises like STELCO \n(due to its current financial performance), Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company \nLimited, and Maldives National Shipping Limited that have accumulated losses in \ntheir balance sheets would face difficulties to raise finance through external sources. \n5.  Land rent for SOEs has been subsidized. Until 2005, SOEs were paying rents at a rate \nof Rf1 per square foot per month, which compares to Rf10\u201315 that the Government collects \nfrom the private sector. This subsidy was estimated to total some $10 million in 2005. The \nGovernment has since raised the land rent for SOEs to Rf3 per square foot per month for the \ncurrent year. If the rental rates charged to the private sector were to be made applicable to all \nSOEs, however, it is expected that some of the SOEs would post losses.  \n \n6.  With the objective of reducing the public sector presence in the economy and mitigating \npressures on the budget, the Government plans to reform its SOEs and increase its returns \nfrom them. SOE reforms are expected to include restructuring of underperforming SOEs by \nmeans of business mix optimization, workforce rationalization, and financial restructuring. If \nappropriate, SOEs found to be unviable can be closed and liquidated. Given recent growth of \nthe private sector, which now competes with the SOEs in almost all sectors, the Government \nalso is considering to privatize SOEs that are no longer strategic for the economy but require \nsubstantial investments for their modernization and to augment the capacities of their facilities.  \n \n7.  Recently, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) has identified three SOEs to be \nprivatized  (i.e.,  Maldives  Industrial  Fisheries Company  Limited,  Maldives  National  Shipping \nLimited, and Nasandhura Palace Hotel) and another (STELCO) to be restructured. In order to \nenable SOE reform, Maldives needs policies and regulations within a common framework for (i) \nidentifying and categorizing SOEs to be privatized, restructured, and closed; (ii) workforce \nrestructuring, including a basis for computing early retirement compensation, rehabilitation and \nretraining  of  displaced  employees;  and  (iii)  establishing  an  institutional  mechanism  for \nimplementing and monitoring the SOE reform process and coordinating with various sponsoring \nministries  for  effectively  implementing  reform  measures  in  targeted  enterprises  under  their \nadministrative control and guidance. To develop a common framework that avoids arbitrariness \nand increases transparency in the reform process, it is essential that policies and guidelines \napplicable across SOEs be formulated. These policies and guidelines will be the basis upon \nwhich the reform plans for the individual enterprise will be developed. Additionally, for the \neffective management and monitoring of the SOE reform process, an institutional framework \nmust be put in place within the Government. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  In STELCO\u2019s case, increased oil prices have affected the company very adversely. The cost of sales up to June \n2005 had risen by 45% compared to the same period in 2004 and 8% compared to the budget for the period. \nSTELCO is running a negative cash balance. Increased fuel prices and interest expenses have contributed to the \ndeteriorating cash balances (MOFT Public Enterprise Monitoring and Evaluation Board. 2006.

Higher tariffs for Male could provide \nrevenues to offset losses from generation, transmission, and distribution in outer atolls. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA\u2019s impact will be for the Government to initiate reforms of its SOEs, and the \noutcomes will help the Government to design and implement reform measures for SOEs in such \nareas as (i) developing an institutional framework for implementing the reform program, (ii) \npreparing  business-restructuring  plans  for  enterprises  designated  for  restructuring  while \nremaining under Government ownership, and (iii) advising and assisting the Government in \ndisinvesting its shareholding in identified SOEs through public share flotation and/or bringing in \na strategic partner. This program has been conceptualized as a pilot program to enable the \nGovernment to build capacity and gain experience and skills in implementing reform of SOEs so \nthat such reform can be extended in the future to the remaining enterprises not covered under \nthe current program.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented under the following four components. \n \n10.  Component 1: Developing Institutional Framework for Planning and Implementing \nSOE Reform. The TA will (i) assist the Government in institutionalizing SOE reform through \nstrengthening the existing Public Enterprises Commission and Public Enterprises Monitoring \nand Evaluation Board (PEMEB), currently domiciled within MOFT, as the central agency for \nimplementing  SOE  reform  measures.  This  will  include  assisting  to  develop  the  needed \norganizational structure (e.g., identifying roles and responsibilities of various positions along \nwith  skill  and  competency  requirements,  reporting  relationships  including  a  formalized \nmechanism  for  interacting  with  other  ministries  having  administrative  control  of  public \nenterprises, activities to be performed within the Government and those that can be outsourced \nto  external  consultants,  and  training  needs);  as  well  as  (ii)  identifying  and  advising  the \nGovernment on the regulatory framework needed to facilitate implementation of SOE reform \nmeasures. Representative policies and regulations include (i) a basis for identifying enterprises \nthat are to be restructured under the Government\u2019s continued ownership, enterprises to be \nprivatized  and  disinvested,  and  enterprises  to  be  closed  down;  (ii)  allowable  financial \nrestructuring  measures,  such  as  converting  Government  loans  into  equity  and  writing  off \nGovernment loans including accumulated interest; (iii) severance schemes for SOE employees \nwho may be displaced as a result of implementing reform measures; (iv) a competitive bidding \nprocess to be followed to ensure objectivity and transparency for disinvestment of Government \nshares and privatization; (v) measures to be taken for liquidating unviable enterprises, including \ncompensating employees and a mechanism for disposing of assets and settling liabilities; and \n(vi) advising the Government on reviewing and/or amending any policy actions, regulations, \nand/or Government orders that may be necessary to facilitate the reform process.   \n \n11.  Component 2: Preparation of Business-Restructuring Plan. The Government has \nidentified STELCO for restructuring while being retained under Government ownership and with \nthe objective of achieving sustainable financial viability. The TA will include (i) identification of \nbusiness-restructuring measures while taking into account existing or new businesses, existing \nor new technologies, and keeping in view environmental issues, investment requirements, and \nemerging market trends over the next 3\u20135 years; (ii) financial restructuring measures that \ninclude  debt  restructuring,  capital  restructuring,  and  financing  investment  plans;  and  (iii) \norganizational  and  workforce  restructuring  measures  that  include  overhauling  company \nmanagement and governance to implement the measures suggested under (i) above. These \n ", "4 \n \nlast-mentioned measures should cover gaps in management, identifying skills to be replenished, \nworkforce restructuring, changes in board compositions and roles, and other related matters. \n \n12.  Component 3: Privatization of SOEs. Of the enterprises identified by the Government \nfor privatization, this pilot program proposes to include three enterprises, namely, Maldives \nIndustrial  Fisheries  Company  Limited,  Maldives  National  Shipping  Company  Limited,  and \nNasandhura Palace Hotel. The TA will include (i) recommending optimal transaction structures \nfor disinvestment and privatization after taking into account various business-related issues \n(including  to  assess  needs  for  bringing  in  strategic  partners,  the  extents  of  Government \nshareholdings  to  be  divested  through  public  offer  and/or  bidding  processes  for  selecting \nstrategic partners, potential private sector partner preferences, and underlying objectives of the \nprivatization exercise); (ii) in the event bringing in a strategic partner is chosen as the preferred \noption, advising the Government on finalizing qualification criteria for strategic partners and \ndrafting notices inviting expressions of interest (EOIs) from potential private sector partners; (iii) \nassisting and advising the Government on the bidding process for selecting strategic partners, \nincluding (a) preparing information packages to be circulated to short-listed potential investors \nidentified on the basis of EOIs submitted, (b) advising management teams of the respective \nenterprises on data room operations and facilitating due diligence processes, (c) managing the \nbidding  processes  to  ensure  they  are  conducted  in  a  transparent  and  fair  manner,  (d) \nrecommending the reserve prices below which the Government should not consider offers, (e) \nevaluating the technical and price bids received, (f) advising on completion of all legal and \naccounting measures for completing transactions, (g) in the event privatization through public \noffer of shares is the preferred option, then recommending and assisting to implement corporate \ngovernance frameworks required for attracting professional managers to the enterprises.  \n \n13.  Component  4:  Designing  a  Social  Safety  Net  (SSN)  Program  for  Employees \nDisplaced as a Result of Implementing SOE Reforms. This component entails assisting and \nadvising the Government to design an SSN program that will, for example, advise displaced \nemployees on alternate livelihood opportunities and provide them retraining. As part of the SSN \nprogram, suitable training courses and agencies need to be identified. The TA will also assess \ninstitutional  capacity  to  deliver  the  retrenchment  program  and  assist  the  Government  to \nstrengthen its capacity to deliver this program. Should amendments or additions be required in \nexisting or proposed labor legislation or policies in order to implement the SSN program, the TA \nwill include advising the Government on these issues. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $470,000 equivalent. ADB will provide approximately \n$400,000 equivalent, and the Government will contribute about $70,000 equivalent in-kind to \ncover counterpart staff, office accommodation and supplies, transport, and other expenses such \nas for in-country study facilitation and workshops. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  MOFT will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MOFT will be supported by PEMEB, and \nthe director of PEMEB will act as the central person for this TA. MOFT will provide office space, \nfurniture, equipment, and counterpart staff for TA consultants, who will receive operational \nadvice and guidance from the Director of PEMEB. A steering committee on SOE reform will be \nset up for the TA. It will be responsible for coordinating the TA, meet to review the related \nreports, and resolve any issues regarding the TA\u2019s implementation. The committee will be \n ", "  5\nheaded by MOFT and include senior officials from the Ministry of Environment, Energy and \nWater; the Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources; the Ministry of Tourism and \nCivil Aviation; and other ministries, as necessary. The steering committee will be chaired by the \ndeputy minister of MOFT with the PEMEB director as the secretary to the steering committee.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of approximately 8 months, intermittently from \nFebruary 2007 to January 2008, and it will require an estimated 41 person-months of consulting \nservices, of which approximately 25 person-months will be international and 16 person-months \nnational consulting services. The following areas of expertise have been identified at this stage \nfor the international consultants: (i) public enterprise reforms specialist and team leader, (ii) \norganizational development specialist, (iii) business restructuring specialist (power sector), (iv) \ncapacity building and administrative restructuring specialist, (v) asset valuation specialist, (vi) \nfinancial  analyst,  (vii)  transaction  specialist  (with  national  consultants\u2019  support),  (viii)  legal \nspecialist  (with  a  national  consultant\u2019s  support),  (ix)  social  safety  net  program  and  labor \nretrenchment specialist, and (x) communication and change management specialist. National \nconsultants will be engaged to complement the expertise of the international consultants. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  and  all  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.5   \n \n17.  For selecting consulting firms, simplified technical proposals and quality and cost-based \nselection will be used. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3, and \na summary initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 4. The consultants will prepare an \ninception report, including a time-bound work plan for TA implementation, within 4 weeks of the \nstart of consulting services. An interim report will be submitted within 3 months from the start of \nconsulting services. A draft final report will be submitted 4 weeks before the end of consulting \nservices, and this is to be discussed in a meeting of the consultants, government officials, and \nADB before being finalized by the consultants. The deliverables of this TA will include draft and \nfinal business restructuring plans, a social safety net program, recommendations on transaction \nstructuring, a preliminary information memorandum, a report on evaluating EOIs, an information \nmemorandum, an information bid package, final transaction agreements, reports on business \nvaluations, reserve price recommendations, and reports on evaluation of bids received.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Maldives for Restructuring and Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.
