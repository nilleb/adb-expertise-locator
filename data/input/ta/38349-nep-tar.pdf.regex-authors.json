INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Nepal (the Government) has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Civil Aviation \nAirport Project. The TA is programmed for ADB\u2019s 2007 TA program for Nepal.1 The TA Fact-\nFinding Mission visited Nepal from 11 to 19 September 2007 and reached agreement with the \nGovernment on TA impact, outcome, scope, implementation arrangements, costs and financing \nplan, and outline terms of reference for consulting services. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The country\u2019s economic performance during the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2007 was \ncharacterized by slow growth, rising inflation, and weak exports. The Government has therefore \nrevised downward its gross domestic product growth forecast for FY2007 from 5% to 3.8%. \nEconomic  performance  continues  to  be  hampered  by  weak  agricultural  growth  and  slow \nindustrial recovery. Private sector confidence has yet to be restored, and investment remains \nsubdued. On the positive side, tourism is rebounding, and worker remittances continue to \nunderpin consumer demand. Transport, communications, and storage are expected to grow by \n6% in FY2007. Further, tourist arrivals rose by 4% in the first 7 months of FY2007 compared to \nthe same period of FY2006, and four new international airlines have started operations to Nepal. \nThis bodes well for future tourist arrivals. \n \n3.  Nepal is a landlocked country with rugged and mountainous terrain that renders the \ndevelopment and maintenance of surface transport facilities difficult and costly. The high cost of \nroad construction and maintenance, and the limited availability of financial resources have \nslowed the development of the surface transport system. Areas of the country remain largely \ninaccessible except via porter and mule tracks and, in some areas, light aircraft landing strips. \nAir  transport  has  played  a  significant  role  in  the  administrative,  economic,  and  social \ndevelopment of the country, and in the absence of adequate surface transport it has provided \nessential  links  between  Kathmandu,  the  capital  city,  and  the  various  administrative  and \ncommercial centers of the country, as well as with the outside world. For many mountainous \nand remote rural districts of the country, air transport may also provide the only means of \nmechanized transport to connect them to other points of destination. Further, civil aviation is of \ncritical importance to the country because most tourists arrive by air. The sector provides vital \nsupport to the development of tourism as well as to trade, manufacturing, and commerce.  \n \n4.  Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) is currently Nepal\u2019s only international airport and its \nlargest domestic one. Eighty percent of foreign tourists enter Nepal by air through TIA.2 TIA and \nmore  than  30  other  operational  domestic  airports  and  airstrips  function  as  the  Nepal  air \ntransport  network  and  crucially  contribute  to  the  socioeconomic  development  of  the  entire \ncountry. Inaugurated in 1955 as a grassy runway, Tribhuvan Airport was renamed Tribhuvan \nInternational Airport in 1964. It now provides civil aviation facilities and passenger services to \nabout 16 international operators and 13 active domestic operators, including the flag carriers \nNepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) and Air Nepal. In 1998 the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal \n(CAAN) was established under the CAAN Act as an independent organization reporting to the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in 4 October 2007. \n2  In 2006, nearly 1.4 million international passengers arrived at TIA, against 1.2 million in 2005. In 1991, 0.2 million \ndomestic passengers moved in and out of TIA. The number rose to nearly 0.7 million in 1998, and it reached 1.1 \nmillion in 2005. International passenger traffic at TIA is expected to grow gradually at an annual rate of 1.24\u2013\n2.31%, and domestic passenger traffic at an annual rate of 2.59\u20134.84%. \n ", "2   \nMinistry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation (MOCTCA), which sets policy. As a regulator and \nairport operator, CAAN is responsible for ensuring the safe, regular, standard, and effective \noperation of flights, and air communication, navigation, and transportation services for domestic \nand international services. However, over the years the roles and functions of CAAN and \nMOCTCA have become blurred as responsibilities overlapped in such areas as airline licensing, \ntariff setting, airport planning, and, to a lesser extent, airport operations. \n5.  The  civil  aviation  sector  in  Nepal  is  relatively  well  managed  and  compliant  with \ninternational  requirements.  However  it  is  not  appropriately  equipped  or  structured  for \nsustainable long-term development. There is acute airside under-capacity at TIA, which rising \ndemand from new international carriers for services into TIA will exacerbate. Further, increasing \ninternational  and  especially  domestic  air  passenger  and  cargo  loads  put  pressure  on  the \ncapacity of TIA and other domestic airports.  \n \n6.  Under current rules and regulations, CAAN and TIA do not operate independently of the \nGovernment,  and  TIA\u2019s  performance  is  limited  by  lack  of  autonomy  and  the  overlap  of \nresponsibilities among MOCTCA, CAAN, and TIA. If properly managed as a commercial entity, \nTIA has potential to be a leading regional airport. Meanwhile, CAAN\u2019s capacity as the country\u2019s \ncivil aviation regulator should be improved in view of growth trends in international and domestic \npassengers and cargo. Initial steps have been taken by the Government to separate CAAN, as \na regulatory body, and TIA, to be run commercially as a revenue-generating entity. To be \nexplored are ways to attract private sector involvement in running TIA or taking over a portion of \nTIA\u2019s operations. \n \n7.  Regarding institutional management, CAAN\u2019s capacity to effectively manage airports is \nconstrained  by  redundant  legislation,  a  lack  of  adequate  autonomy,  and  inappropriate \norganization  structures.  Its  management  information  system  is  inadequate,  harming \norganizational effectiveness and decision making at TIA and other airports. Another problem is \nCAAN\u2019s  weakness  in  general  operational  and  financial  management  for  lack  of  systems, \nprocedures, and qualified people to properly manage business operations. There are concerns \nabout the commercial productivity of TIA and, to a lesser extent, the regional airports.3\n \n8.  Government Strategy. An approach paper for the interim plan covering the 3-year \nperiod of FY2008\u2013FY2010 has been finalized by the Government and was endorsed by the \nNational Development Council in July 2007.4 To support inclusive economic development and \ngrowth, physical infrastructure development is being prioritized. The sustained development of \nthe tourism sector has been identified as an important way to support balanced economic \ngrowth. For the country\u2019s civil aviation sector, the main goal is now to achieve enhanced \ncapacity at TIA and other civil airports and improved quality of air transport services. To enable \nthe  sector  to  effectively  provide  support  to  national  development  efforts,  the  national  air \ntransport  system  and  services  are  to  be  further  enhanced  and  improved  by  increasing \noperational  capacity,  effectiveness,  and  efficiency.  In  the  long  term,  the  Government  is \nconsidering constructing a second international airport. This policy decision was taken in view of \nthe expectation that international passenger numbers will reach 2 million annually by 2015. On \nthe recent development of domestic airports, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China \nhas  expressed  interest  in  supporting  Nepal\u2019s  improvement  of  the  new  Pokhara  Airport  to \n                                                 \n3  Two major airport business assets, ground handling and air cargo, do not generate any revenue, and other \ncommercial  activities,  such  as  rents  and  retail,  etc.,  are  not  optimized.  The  national  air  navigation  and \ncommunications system urgently needs rehabilitation and poses a threat to air safety. CAAN has submitted a \nrequest to the Japanese Government for assistance, which is being considered. \n4  The interim plan was approved by the Government of Nepal on 5 December 2007. \n ", "  3\ninternational standard. Similar discussions with the Government of the Republic of Korea are \nbeing held about improving the Buddha Gautama/Lumbini airport to international standard.  \n \n9.  ADB has been involved in the civil aviation sector in Nepal since 1969 through five loans \nand four TA projects. The Tribhuvan International Airport Improvement Project, the most recent \nADB intervention, comprised an airport improvement component that included expanding the \ninternational terminal, constructing a cargo-handling facility, and improving safety-related roads \nand other facilities, as well as capacity building that included advisory consulting services to \nCAAN  during  its  initial  operation  and  consulting  services  for  management  assistance  to \ndomestic contactors. Given the important role of civil aviation in the country, the Nepal Country \nStrategy and Program (CSP) endorsed by the Board in September 20045, includes further \nassistance for the civil aviation sector focusing on (i) improving TIA and strategic domestic \nairports, (ii) restructuring and reforming CAAN and NAC, and (iii) the regulatory framework for \nprivate sector participation in the sector. With ADB\u2019s involvement and other donors\u2019 assistance, \nthe  capacity  of  the  sector,  physical  as  well  as  institutional,  has  improved  considerably  to \naccommodate the rapid growth of air traffic that has occurred since the 1990s. This was further \nconfirmed by ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2008\u20132010, approved in July 2007.6 \nADB\u2019s reengagement in the sector will be based on a careful assessment of progress in policy \nand regulation, and will take conflict-related considerations into account.  \n \n10.  In 2006, nearly a decade after the last civil aviation loan was approved, ADB helped the \nGovernment  to  update its  master plan  for  developing  TIA  and  fine  tuned  alignment  of  its \nstrategic objectives with the Government\u2019s priority areas for civil aviation sector development. In \nview of this, ADB helped the Government prepare a civil aviation sector strategy7 to update the \nmaster plan for developing TIA and prepare a civil aviation sector development strategy to meet \ndemand for developing airport infrastructure and capacity. The reports, the Civil Aviation Sector \nStrategy Volumes I and II, have been submitted to the Government and are still under review by \nthe CAAN Board before being submitted for Government\u2019s endorsement. They contain a sector \nstrategy, sector management plan, and infrastructure development plan for TIA and selected \ndomestic airports. The civil aviation sector development strategy proposed a phased sector \ndevelopment plan calling for the (i) immediate improvement of airport infrastructure of TIA, (ii) \nimprovement of the air space navigation system, (iii) improvement of key regional airports, and \n(iv) construction of the second international airport. A sector management plan aims to achieve \n(i)  an  effective  and  efficient  civil  aviation  administration;  (ii)  appropriate  responsibilities  for \nmanagement, pricing, and service delivery; (iii) compliance and alignment with statutes and \npolicies; (iv) institutional accountability and transparency; (v) effective technical regulation and \nairport management; (vi) a redirected and motivated workforce; (vii) simplified personnel and \nfinancial management; (viii) strong and clearly defined regulatory control; (ix) capacity to self-\nfund current and future investment; (x) reduced barriers to entry into the aviation market; (xi) \nstrong and balanced domestic airline operations; (xii) an increase in non-aeronautical revenue; \nand (xiii) a competitive and balanced aviation market. This TA will study the feasibility of the \nrecommended investments for further ADB intervention. \n \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2004.

Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be the improved quality of Nepal air transport services, as well \nas enhancement of the manner in which they are administered and managed. The outcome of \nthe TA will be an agreed feasibility design suitable for ADB financing to improve airport(s) in the \ncountry.  \n12.  The TA will contain reassessments and surveys of air traffic and transport network \nupdates to be used as the bases to design a viable and feasible project that will address the \ndeficiencies of airport operation in terms of management, capacity, viable operation, safety, and \nfeasibility. The TA will reassess TA 4772 recommendations for the improvement of TIA and \ndetermine whether or not they are feasible and viable, and if other activities are to be included. \nThe TA will propose a plan for meeting future air navigation equipment requirements in a 10-\nyear  timeframe,  which  will  prescribe  and  document  the  navigation,  communications, \nsurveillance, and other equipment, both terrestrial and satellite based, required to support future \nnational air transport operations. Further, the TA will reassess CAAN institutional capacity and \nprepare an action plan for capacity and institutional development programs to be implemented \nunder the project, together with the provision of short term assistance to CAAN in key areas as \nCAAN aligns itself with the proposed sector strategy. Further, the TA will explore potential areas \nof, and assess conditions for, private sector involvement in the possible financing, ownership, \noperation, rehabilitation, maintenance, and management of airports. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Institutional  and  Capacity  Development.  The  TA  will  review  and  update  existing \ninstitutional assessments of sector institutions, especially CAAN, and prepare a time-bound \ncapacity-development action plan and its constituent capacity development programs. \n \n14.  TIA Infrastructure, Capacity, and Demand Analysis. The TA will review and update \nthe findings of TA 4772 in terms of (i) current airport capacity, (ii) demand for the next 20 years, \nand (iii) recommended improvements to meet the future demand. The infrastructure to be \nassessed will include airside, the terminal area, and air traffic control.  \n \n15.  Engineering.  The  TA  will  prepare  an  outline  design  including  cost  estimates  and \nimplementation arrangements for civil works. \n \n16.  Economic  Analysis.  The  TA  will  carry  out  an  economic  analysis of  the  proposed \nprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997), \ntaking into account flows of international and domestic passengers and goods in domestic and \nforeign trade. The net benefit to the poor in the rural areas through increased employment and \nbusiness opportunities will be studied.  \n \n17.  Financial Analysis. The TA will carry out a financial analysis of the proposed project in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects (2002), including calculating the financial internal rate of return and the \nweighted average cost of capital, taking into account financial costs and benefits. Sensitivity \nanalysis will be carried out in the project\u2019s risk assessment.  \n \n ", "  5\n18.  Environmental  Assessment  and  Social  Impact  and  Resettlement  Analysis.  A \nconsultant  will  conduct  an  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental  impact \nassessment as required in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), the Operations \nManual F1/BP and F1/OP (2003), Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects \n(1993), and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), and the Government\u2019s Guidelines \nand procedures. Social analysis will be carried out according to ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty \nand  Social  Analysis  (2001).  If  necessary,  the  project  will  prepare  a  resettlement  and/or \nindigenous people framework or plans consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) and Indigenous Peoples Policy (1998). A summary initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $940,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $750,000 \nequivalent in foreign exchange cost. The details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan. The Government will finance $190,000 equivalent by providing office accommodation, \nsupport facilities, counterpart staff, maps, reports, and other logistical support. The Government \nhas been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  MOCTCA will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and CAAN the Implementing Agency. \nCAAN will appoint a project director to be responsible for day-to-day supervision of the TA. The \nGovernment has assured that all required counterpart staff, office space, furniture, equipment, \nsupport facilities for surveys, maps, reports, and other support services will be made available to \nthe consultants in a timely manner. All equipment for the TA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and turned over to MOCTCA \nupon TA completion. \n \n21.  An  international  consulting  firm,  in  association  with  a  national  consulting  firm  or \nproposing individual national consultants, will be recruited to provide 18 person-months  of \ninternational consultancy, and 14 person-months of national consultancy, with expertise in the \nareas  of  civil  aviation  engineering,  civil  aviation  management,  institution  development,  air \ntransport economy, and financial analysis. In addition, ADB will directly recruit two individual \nnational consultants to carry out (i) a social analysis, poverty impact, and resettlement analysis \n(3 person-months) and (ii) an environmental assessment of the proposed project (3 person-\nmonths). All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will be selected \naccording  to  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS  90:10)  procedures  and  a  simplified \ntechnical proposal. The estimated starting date is April 2008, and the estimated closing date is \nFebruary 2009.The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. Seminars and \nworkshops will be held to disseminate the output of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.

The project will support economic growth by improving transport connectivity to remote rural areas, as well as by providing better \nquality services to domestic and international air transport users, including the 80% of tourists who arrive in Nepal at Tribhuvan \nInternational Airport (TIA). \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  Project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) allocates 3 person-months consultancy to assess the social and resettlement \nimpact of the investment components.  \n2.  One of the components of the expansion of TIA is to improve the domestic terminal at TIA serving air transport to and from remote \nrural areas. This and eventual improvement of rural airports in isolated districts without road connections to the rest of the \ncountry will play a critical role in providing access for business development, emergency response, and medical \nevacuation services. Improvements may also play a vital role by providing efficient postal services, thereby linking \nmigrant workers abroad with their families in their home communities. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the project? See \nC.2. above. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? The improvement of TIA, especially if this \nbecomes revenue-generating entity, will benefit the improvement of domestic rural airports. This will increase accessibility to those \nareas, especially ones not accessible by road, and also address the special needs of the country as a landlocked country. More \ndeveloped rural areas with good connectivity with business and market centers will support political stability. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address them? \nPolitical instability and worsening of security situation in the rural areas could hamper improvement of air transport to those areas. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. The potential initial stakeholders are the government agencies concerned, flight operators and their association, travel agency \nassociations, concerned civil society, and possibly private sector corporations potentially interested in some service operations at \nTIA, etc.   \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, community \nmobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? During the feasibility study, \nseveral workshops, seminars, and consultations will be conducted with stakeholders.

What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nThe TA will explore mainstreaming gender in the sector and how to create maximum access to sources of employment, credit, \ntechnology, and educational and health facilities. Several issues such as the followings maybe assessed: (i) incorporating gender \nperspectives in all programs and projects, (ii) sensitizing implementation mechanisms to gender concerns, (iii) ensuring that measures \ninitiated to improve gender equity in project benefits are adequate, and (iv) developing indicators and mechanisms to monitor and \nevaluate project impact on women not only in terms of their participation but of their empowerment as well. Social mobilization, group \nformation, informal education, and credit can reach rural women effectively and for their empowerment with the improvement of rural \nconnectivity. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by improving \nwomen\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making?       Yes         \nNo    Please explain. {If yes, a gender action plan should be prepared during PPTA/due diligence.} \nNot specifically, but some issues can be covered in the TA. \n \n3.
