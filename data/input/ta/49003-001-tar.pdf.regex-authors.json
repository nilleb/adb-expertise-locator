INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested support from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen policies and delivery modes for social work \nservices for the elderly with special difficulties. A fact-finding mission took place in Beijing, the \nPRC in January 2015, and ADB reached an agreement with the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) \non  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  costs  and  financing,  implementation  arrangements,  and \noutline terms of reference for consulting services for the technical assistance (TA). The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The main demographic challenges facing the PRC in this century are the dramatic aging \nof its population, scale of internal migration largely driven by urbanization, and new social and \neconomic  vulnerabilities  arising  from  these  changes.  The  elderly  with  special  physical, \npsychological, and/or financial difficulties now have more diverse and individualized needs. \nThey require a combination of targeted poverty-reduction measures and affordable medical and \nsocial services. Data on the elderly with special difficulties show that the PRC has 100 million \nliving in empty-nest households, 100 million with chronic illnesses, 50 million left behind in the \ncountryside alone, 38 million unable to perform daily activities, 23 million stricken in poverty or \nwith low income, and 10 million who have lost their only child. The number of elderly aged       \n80 years and above has reached about 22.7 million.2 A range of gender-related disparities \ninclude  women\u2019s  poorer  health  status,  lower  cognitive  performance,  and  poorer  financial \nsecurity than men of similar age. \n \n3.  The  PRC  has  responded  to  overall  elderly  care  needs  with  new  policy  and  legal \ninitiatives, including the Twelfth Five-Year Plan for the Development of Social Care Services for \nthe Elderly, 2011\u20132015, and the revised Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of the \nElderly, 2013. Both documents call for developing social services for the elderly, including \nthrough  (i)  expansion  and  professionalization  of  elderly  care  social  workers,  social  work \nstandards, and the social work sector; and (ii) encouragement for government agencies and \nsocial organizations to engage in delivery of outsourced elderly care social services. These \ndocuments have been supported by guidance on implementation modalities, including Opinions \non  Strengthening  the  Development  of  Professional  Social  Workers,  jointly  issued  by \n19 ministries; the Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for the Development of Social \nWork  Forces,  2011\u20132020;  and  the  Guidelines  for  Government  Purchase  of  Social  Work \nServices, including the use of state lottery funds toward the procurement of elderly care services \nby social organizations. The reform agenda of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central \nCommittee of the Chinese Communist Party in November 2013 calls for an acceleration of \nreforms to improve and expand the provision of social services\u2014such as education, health, \nelderly  care,  and  social  protection\u2014allowing  more  benefits  from  development  to  be  more \nequally shared by all. \n \n4.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC, \npromoting basic social services; and ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, with renewed \nemphasis on health and education as part of ADB\u2019s inclusive growth agenda.3 The TA is also \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 April 2015. \n2  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Ministry of Social Affairs. 2013.

Manila. \n ", "2   \npart of a new area of strategic thrusts in ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC to develop services for an \naging society, as reflected in the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017.4 ADB has \nprovided several TA projects in the PRC for consolidation of the social assistance (dibao) \nsystem,5 including the ongoing TA on improving efficiency in public service procurement and \ndelivery.6 Aging will be a critical challenge for sustaining growth, making it more inclusive, and \nproviding  social  protection  in  the  region,  as  this  demographic  shift  has  started  in  most \ndeveloping economies in Asia. The aging population represents an important opportunity for \nADB to provide TA and lending in the coming years. It will also build on findings from ADB\u2019s TA \nfor Promoting Market Innovation in Developing Social Infrastructure: Old Age Caring; TA for \nStrategic Elderly Care Services Development in Yichang, on local planning for elderly care in \nYichang; TA for Strategies for Involving Social Workers in Social Assistance, on strengthening \nsocial workers to support social assistance recipients in their transition to the labor market; and \nTA  for  Strengthening  Government  and  Social  Organization  Cooperation  for  Rural  Poverty \nReduction, on outsourcing and social organizations.7 \n \n5.  Several key issues require urgent action to promote both professional and community-\nbased  social  work  and  outsourcing  of  social  services  focused  on  the  elderly  with  special \ndifficulties. First, a strong policy framework and guidelines for care of the elderly with special \ndifficulties  are  needed.  Second,  a  rewarding  career  path  for  social  workers  needs  to  be \ndeveloped,  starting  with  appropriate  education  and  training,  and  decent  pay  and  working \nconditions. Third, improved government procurement mechanisms, including volunteer incentive \nmechanisms, for services provided to the elderly with special difficulties by social organizations \nengaged in elderly care, community development, or poverty reduction need to be developed, \nparticularly in remote or difficult-to-access conditions.8 \n \n6.  MOCA has submitted a project proposal to ADB through the Ministry of Finance to \nprovide TA to better understand international and national trends in professionalizing social \nwork, especially to provide services to the elderly and provide tools to MOCA to standardize, \nmonitor, and evaluate social work services for the elderly with special difficulties. This will \ncontribute to improving the education and practical experience of social workers and social \norganizations caring for the elderly with special needs, and provide more effective and relevant \nsocial support and delivery modes. The TA findings will potentially be replicable nationwide. \n \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2015.

The impact will be a strengthened policy environment for social work for the elderly, \nprimarily for those with special difficulties. The outcome will be policy recommendations on \nstrengthening social work services for the elderly with special difficulties. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  An extensive review of international and national experiences and best practices will \nhelp in the development of guidelines and a broad implementation framework for social work \nservice standards for the elderly with special difficulties. The TA will complement this with a \nmonitoring and evaluation system on social work services for the elderly with special difficulties. \nThe findings from the TA will be used to formulate policy recommendations on strengthening \nsocial work services for the elderly with special difficulties. \n \n9.  Key activities of the TA will be organized under four outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Study report on national and international experience on social \nwork services for the elderly with special difficulties. The TA will review \nnational and international literature, and ongoing pilot experiences in the PRC. \nThe focus of the study will be on policies, financing, mode and scope of service \ndelivery, and quality and safety monitoring. The study report will be disseminated \nto public and private stakeholders, and social organizations. The TA will facilitate \nrelevant  field  visits  in  the  PRC  and  an  overseas  study  tour  (tentatively)  in \nCanada, Europe, Japan, the Republic of Korea, or Thailand to study social work \nservices.  This  will  provide  a  clear  demonstration  of  elderly  social  work  and \ncommunity care policy and implementation, including financing, delivery modes, \nhuman resources development, and monitoring and evaluation. Participants will \nbe less than 10 decision makers from central and provincial levels where the TA \nis active. Study tour findings and policy recommendations will be presented in \nworkshops. \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Guidelines and broad implementation framework for social work \nservice standards for the elderly with special difficulties. The TA will study \nthe needs of the elderly with special difficulties, identify and prepare guidelines \nfor  relevant  social  work  services  and  their  delivery,  and  prepare  a  broad \nimplementation framework to implement the guidelines. Concerned officials of \nthe ministry and bureaus of civil affairs will be trained on the guidelines. \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Indicator system for monitoring and evaluation of social work \nservices  for  the  elderly  with  special  difficulties. The TA  will  develop  an \nindicator  system,  including  through  stakeholder  consultation  with  central  and \nlocal government staff, professional social workers, other carers, and a diverse \nrange of concerned community and social organizations. The TA will also study \nthe  administrative  requirements  and  pilot  test  the  feasibility  of  the  indicator \nsystem. In addition, it will develop an evaluation system for the ministry and \nbureaus  of  civil  affairs  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  social  work  services \nprograms, including from the perspective of male and female clients. Concerned \n ", "4   \nofficials of the ministry and bureaus of civil affairs will be trained on the indicator \nsystem. \n \n(iv)  Output 4: Dissemination of findings. Two workshops and a final conference\u2014\nwith the participation of central and provincial officials, the private sector, and civil \nsociety stakeholders\u2014will be held to discuss and disseminate TA findings and \npolicy recommendations. A knowledge product on social work service standards \nand delivery modes for the elderly with special difficulties will be prepared. A final \nTA report will be submitted to MOCA and ADB. \n \n10.  Potential risks are considered manageable given the high commitment and urgency for \nMOCA to develop national recommendations on strengthening social work services for the \nelderly  with  special  difficulties.  Two  identified  risks  are  (i)  ineffective  coordination  among \ngovernment bodies and with external stakeholders, and (ii) lack of data available to pilot test the \nindicator  system.  Coordination  among  government  bodies  is  required  to  develop  a  set  of \nrealistic social work services and indicators, taking into account available financial and human \nresources. This risk will be mitigated by organizing two workshops and a final conference with \nmultisector participation. Given the high standing of elderly care on the policy agenda, risk is \nlimited for lack of cooperation from other government bodies. Data availability for pilot testing \nthe indicator system will require particular attention by MOCA and consultants, and the pilot test \nwill be developed in accordance with expected data availability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing   \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of in-kind contribution through the provision of office \naccommodation  and  venues for meetings,  counterpart  staff and  allowances,  miscellaneous \nadministration expenses, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  MOCA (Department of Social Work) will be the executing agency for the TA. MOCA will \ndesignate a senior staff as the TA focal point. The TA will be implemented over 18 months \ntentatively from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2016. \n \n13.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n14.  In dialogue with MOCA, ADB will engage an international (2 person-months) and four \nnational (30 person-months) consultants, who will report to MOCA and ADB. Consultants will be \nhired on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time).9 The senior international consultant will have multi-\ncountry expertise in social work and elderly care planning and implementation, in addition to \nevaluation  expertise  and  demonstrated  writing  skills.  The  national  consultants  will  include \nspecialists with expertise in social work development and service outsourcing, assessment of \nelderly care needs, evaluation methods, development of operational guidelines, monitoring and \nevaluation  system  development  and  implementation,  and  administrative  and  finance. \nConsultants\u2019  tasks  and  reporting  requirements  are  in  the  outline  terms  of  reference  for \n                                                \n9  Some consultants will be hired as individual consultants through entities (e.g., universities and research centers). \n ", "  5 \nconsultants (Appendix 3). Consultant reports will be prepared in Chinese and English. The TA \nwill also recruit resource persons (tentatively 10) to support the workshops and final conference. \n \n15.  Regular meetings will be held involving MOCA and concerned provincial bureau officials, \nnongovernment organizations involved in social work, and concerned educational and aging \ninstitutions.  Dissemination  of  TA  achievements  will  be  ensured  through  two  multisector \nworkshops; a bilingual knowledge product on social work service standards and delivery modes \nfor the elderly with special difficulties in the PRC, which will be disseminated in hard copy and \nelectronically,  including  through  appropriate  PRC  websites;  and  a  final  conference  on  TA \nfindings  with  participation  of  provincial,  national,  and  international  experts,  and  associated \nmedia reporting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for Social Work Services Policy and Delivery Modes for the \nElderly with Special Difficulties, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2020a    Assumptions \nA strengthened policy  20 million elderly with special  MOCA  The government \nenvironment for social  difficulties are receiving social  sustains its commitment \nwork for the elderly,  work services  to extending and \nprimarily for those with    professionalizing social \nspecial difficulties  200,000 professional elderly  work services for the \ncare social workers are  elderly. \nfunctioning   \n  Mechanisms for \nElderly care community- collecting required sex-\nbased service organizationsb  disaggregated data are \nand institution-based elderly  operational and \ncare centers are providing  accurate. \nsocial services \nOutcome      Assumption \nPolicy  Policy recommendations  MOCA certification  MOCA leads advocacy \nrecommendations on  reviewed by MOCA by  process to \nstrengthening social  December 2016  institutionalize \nwork services for the      recommendations. \nelderly with special       \ndifficulties  Risks \nIneffective coordination \namong government \nbodies \n \nAccelerated policy \nrequirements overtake \nstudy time frame. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
