In 2002, the Government of Pakistan requested project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA) for a Third Barani Development Project.1 An Asian Development Bank (ADB) Fact-Finding \nMission visited Pakistan from 23 April to 3 May 2003 and held meetings with Federal and Punjab \nprovincial government departments and agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \nother aid agencies. Field visits were made to earlier and ongoing barani projects and discussions \nwere also held with district government officials in Chakwal, Gujrat, Jehlum, Narowal, and Sialkot \ndistricts. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government regarding the objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, financing plan, outline terms of reference, and implementation schedule for \nthe TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Punjab has a land area of 205,345 square kilometers, and with 73.6 million people is \nPakistan\u2019s most populated province; 68.7% of the population live in rural areas. Income poverty in \nPunjab increased significantly from 25.2% in FY1991 to 33% in FY1999. Poverty in the rural areas \nin FY1999 was estimated at 36%, and in the urban areas at 25.5%. Together with income poverty, \nkey social indicators in Punjab have also displayed a disappointing trend. The status of rural \nwomen is poor and restrictive. The literacy rate stands at 57.2% for males and 35.1% for females, \nwith marked urban/rural and regional differences between and within districts. Ethnic composition \nin Pakistan is along linguistic lines. The majority of the population speak Punjabi, with small \nnumbers of Seraki, Urdu and Pushto speakers.2 About 45% of the farms in Punjab are smaller than \n2 hectares (ha), accounting for only 12% of the total cultivated area; approximately 34% of farms \nare greater than 2 ha and less than 5 ha, accounting for 21% of the total cultivated area; 21% of \nfarms are greater than 5 ha, but account for 61% of the total cultivated area. Access to land is \ncrucial to reduce poverty. In 1990, 72% of farms were owner operated with the remainder operated \nunder  tenancy  agreements.  Tenurial  arrangements  vary,  with  the  most  common  forms  being \nsharecropping and lease. Unequal land tenure patterns have implications for income distribution, \ncan negatively affect agricultural productivity, and can therefore be a major cause of poverty.3  \n \n3.  The barani areas in Punjab cover over 7.5 million ha in 13 districts.4 Rainfall is erratic and \nvaries greatly from the northeast to the southwest of the region. Farm sizes are small and \ndeclining, and land is fragmented. Farming systems are adapted to the natural conditions, with a \nvariety of strategies used to avoid the risk associated with erratic rainfall. Off-farm employment, \nparticularly in urban areas, supplements farm income where farm sizes are not viable. Seasonal \nlabor scarcity exists. Women play an important role in farming, the workload of females outside the \nhomesteads increasing when men out-migrate for seasonal work. Landlessness is significant.  \n \n4.  In the Punjab, both the Government and its development partners have made substantial \ninvestments in barani and rural development projects in the last 20 years, and a number of projects \nhave  been  implemented  with  support  from  ADB,5  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural\n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) 7 April 2003 as Barani Development III Project \n(Punjab). Barani means rainfed. \n2  Further explanation is provided in the Summary Initial Poverty and Social Analysis of Appendix 1.  \n3  ADB. 2002. Poverty in Pakistan.

The experiences and lessons learned from earlier projects show that targeting of small \nfarmers was not achieved consistently and backup measures were not taken to ensure distribution \nof project benefits to the poor. This placed larger landowners with better connections, information, \nand financial capacity at a greater advantage. In other cases benefits were confined mostly to \nadjacent fields belonging to a few households. Organization of women\u2019s groups could not be \nsustained. Institutional impact was minimal because local communities were not fully involved in \nproject design and implementation. An integrated approach was not followed in the selection of \nsubproject sites. The ongoing IFAD-supported Barani Village Development Project puts greater \nfocus on social mobilization and community organizing, and on the formation and capacity building \nof women community organizations. The proposed project will build on the experiences and \nlessons learned from previous and ongoing investments. \n \n6.  With the Government\u2019s strong commitment to poverty reduction, centering on empowering \nthe poor and providing them with increased economic opportunities and greater access to physical \nand social assets as expressed in its poverty reduction strategy, the overall policy environment is \nfavorable  for  a  poverty  focus  investment  project.  The  Government  has  embarked  on  new \ndevelopment initiatives in the productive sectors and on social and physical infrastructure provision \nin  parallel  with  major  economic  and  governance  (access  to  justice,  decentralization)  reform \ninitiatives. The provincial poverty reduction strategy assigns priority to attacking rural poverty \nthrough  higher  financial  allocations,  improving  physical  infrastructure  and  access  to  physical \nassets, balanced regional development, and development of a database for sound planning. The \nPartnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction (April 2002) between the Government and ADB \nconfirms continued support to asset creation for the poor, particularly women, improving good \ngovernance including people\u2019s participation. Therefore, the proposed project is consistent with the \nFederal  and  the  provincial  governments\u2019  poverty  reduction  strategies,  and  the  Partnership \nAgreement on Poverty Reduction between the Government and ADB. It will contribute significantly \nto strongly support the development, reform, and poverty reduction agenda of the Government, \nparticularly  by  applying  a  thorough  livelihood  systems  analysis  including  female  and  male \nbeneficiaries\u2019  demands  and  needs,  bridging  development  gaps  between  subdistricts  of  the \nnorthern districts, and extending project interventions to the least developed districts of the Punjab. \n  \n                                                 \n6  IFAD. 1980.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The purpose of the TA is the improvement of the economic well-being and social status of \nthe poor through economic, social, and sustainable natural resource management interventions. \nThe output of the TA will be the feasibility study and design of an investment project to focus on \npoverty reduction in selected areas (i) not covered within the districts under previous or ongoing \nprojects (Appendix 2, Table 1), to complement and extend project interventions; and (ii) of the least \ndeveloped and other barani districts in the Punjab (Appendix 2, Table 2).  \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will be executed in two phases. In the first phase (i) background reviews and study \nand analysis of experiences and lessons learned from barani, rural, and agriculture development \nprojects in Pakistan will be carried out; (ii) the basic design will be prepared for a poverty-focused \nproject to extend project interventions to selected areas not covered within districts under previous \nor ongoing barani projects (Appendix 2, Table 1);10 and in parallel (iii) a wider livelihood systems \nanalysis will be conducted in selected areas of the least developed and other barani districts in the \nPunjab (Appendix 2, Table 2). In the second phase, the feasibility and design of appropriate \ninterventions focused on targeting the poor will be undertaken in close collaboration with district \ngovernments of the project areas.  \n   \n9.  Consultations and Workshops. Extensive stakeholder consultations will be conducted in \npreparing  and  implementing  the  proposed  project  to  ensure  ownership  and  sustainability. \nStakeholder groups from the public being directly or indirectly affected by the project (women\u2019s \ngroups,  individuals,  families),  elected  local  government  representatives,  relevant  government \nagencies, and civil society organizations will participate.  Workshops, focus group discussions, and \nappropriate media, including information technology (IT), will be used for consultations.  \n \n10.  Information Technology. Use of and access to information technology and the Internet is \ngrowing steadily in Punjab province. District governments\u2019 IT plans envisage connectivity within \ndistricts and down to the union council level by the end of 2004/2005.11 Several databases \nsupporting these services, such as land revenue,  are based on information collected through \ngeographic information system (GIS) mapping. GIS expertise exists in government, the academe, \nthe private sector, and NGOs. A digital atlas for the project districts, a web-based GIS system \ncomprised of geospatial and socioeconomic indicators, would support project design planning and \nmonitoring and promote transparency in the decision-making process. Initially the digital atlas \nwould  comprise  data  and  information  collected  and  generated  during  the  TA.  Later,  the \nGovernment may decide that the digital atlas data should be published on the Internet via the \nGovernment of Punjab\u2019s web portal and district government web sites.  The TA will assess the \nneed for capacity building of the district governments particularly in the areas of IT, including \nintegrated database and use of GIS in planning and monitoring, as part of a digital atlas. \n \n                                                 \n10  The project activities and interventions for these tehsils to be considered by the TA in consultation with the district \ngovernments will be in the following fields: (i) social mobilization and organization focusing on women, and functional \nliteracy for women; (ii) agriculture and livestock extension; (iii) water resource development and management (mini-\ndams, ponds, sump and dug wells, pumps, on-farm-water management); (iv) utilization of available water bodies for \nfish culture; (v) link roads and culverts; (vi) information technology including capacity building of district governments \nand use of geographic information system and integrated data base for planning and monitoring; and (vii) applied \nresearch in medicinal plants, soil and water conservation, and livestock and fodder. The TA will also assess options for \nproject support to off-farm income generation. \n11  For instance, Chakwal district website www.apnachakwal.com. \n ", "4 \n11.  Livelihood Analysis. Livelihood analysis based on desk reviews and field work will be \nconducted in the least developed and other barani districts (Appendix 2, Table 2): (i) poverty \nstudies12 to estimate poverty levels and characteristics, participatory poverty assessments, and \nprofiles of poverty in the area; and (ii) sector and thematic papers on district government budgets; \nnatural resource system; social structures, systems, and conditions; private sector; NGOs; road \nnetwork;  employment  and  incomes;  agriculture;  livestock;  and  institutional  and  administrative \nframework.  The  livelihood  analysis  will  be  presented  to  the  district  governments  and  other \nstakeholders (to include GIS-based presentation of basic data, studies, surveys and findings). \n   \n12.  Preliminary Recommendations. The TA will recommend, in consultation with the district \ngovernments and through stakeholder participation (i) \"best-bet\",  high  pay-off prioritized entry \npoints that will have significant impact on the livelihood of the poor; (ii) poverty targeting indicators \nand criteria; and (iii) a broad strategy for implementation.13  Specifically, links across sectors, \nbetween field and policy levels, between public and private sectors, between various government \ninstitutions, and between urban and rural will be identified and considered so as to provide a sound \nbasis for the design of appropriately sequenced interventions.  \n \n13.  Feasibility and Project Design. Based on selected areas and interventions agreed upon \nwith the Government, the TA will (i) describe the project scope, area, and target group,14 including \ninputs and outputs, strategy, policy recommendations, training and research requirements, and the \nunderlying technical assumptions; (ii) indicate the modalities for adopting a process approach in \nparticipatory  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring,  clearly  indicating  how  the  district \ngovernment will adapt to its facilitation role, and being clearly in line with devolution; (iii) prepare \ncost  estimates,  economic  and  financial  analyses  and  the  implementation  schedule;  and  (iv) \nprepare  the  project  framework.  Implementation  arrangements  will  be  fully  aligned  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s devolution efforts. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, consisting of $126,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $374,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will cover the entire \nforeign exchange cost as well as $274,000 equivalent of the local currency cost for a total of \n$400,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the remaining local currency \ncost of $100,000 equivalent. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 3. The Government has \nbeen informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, commencing in November 2003 and ending in \nApril 2004. A firm or consortium of firms will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB  for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. The consultants will be selected using the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod and biodata technical proposals. The TA will require a total of 45.5 person-months of \nconsulting  services,  comprising  5.5  person-months  of  international  and  40  person-months  of \n                                                 \n12  The Summary Initial Poverty and Social Analysis is in Appendix 1. \n13  The TA will examine the complementarities with citizen community boards (CCBs) registered under the Punjab Local \nGovernment Ordinance of 2001. CCBs are voluntary groups of non-elected citizens, for proactive self-help initiatives in \nthe development and improvement of service delivery at the local level. CCBs are funded from voluntary contributions, \ngrants, and endowments and receive support from the local governments through matching grants of up to 80% of the \ncost of a project. Local governments are mandated to spend 25% of their development budget through CCBs. \n14  Strong emphasis will be given to the development of appropriate selection criteria for the subdistricts and communities \nto be included in the proposed project. ", "    5 \ndomestic inputs. The TA will be led by an international economist with experience of working in \npoverty-focused  rural  development  projects.  Domestic  consultant  expertise  is  required  in \nsocial/gender  issues,  agricultural  economics,  engineering,  watershed  management,  animal \nhusbandry/livestock, institutions and governance, information technology/data base and GIS, and \nenvironmental impact assessment. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in \nAppendix 4. \n \n16.  Overall responsibility for the TA will lie with the Planning and Development Board of the \nGovernment of Punjab. Responsibility for TA implementation will be delegated to the Agency for \nBarani Area Development (ABAD), which will act as the Executing Agency for the TA. ABAD will be \nresponsible for coordination with Federal and provincial government departments and agencies; for \nliaison with the district governments; and for ensuring provision of requisite support to the TA \nconsultants, including access to information and project sites and facilities. The TA consultants will \nhave an office in Rawalpindi and field offices in the project districts. Specific assurances from the \ngovernment  include  (i)  the  appointment  of  a  qualified  and  experienced  full-time  TA  project \ncoordinator and support staff to provide support and coordination; (ii) the requisite counterpart staff \nto  work  on  the  TA  with  the  consultants;  (iii)  the  provision  of  appropriate  transportation  for \ngovernment counterparts; (iv) office space, utilities, furnishings, and local communication facilities \nfor the consultants and counterparts; and (v) assistance with data and Survey of Pakistan maps, \nsurveys, consultations, and workshops. \n \n17.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 4 weeks of the start of the study \noutlining the work plan for implementation of the TA, including detailed design and methodology for \nthe livelihood analysis, and any preliminary findings relevant to the design of the project; (ii) an \ninterim  report  within  12  weeks  of  commencing  their  services  containing  background  review, \nlivelihood analysis, report on consultation meetings, initial digital atlas, basic design to extend \ninterventions to selected areas not covered within districts under previous or ongoing barani \ninterventions,  and  recommendations  for  points  of  intervention  in  selected  areas  of  the  least \ndeveloped and other barani districts; (iii) a draft final report containing all work undertaken in the \nTA within 5 months of commencing their services; and (iv) a final report within 1 month after \ncomments on the draft final report have been provided by the Government and ADB. Tripartite \nmeetings of the Government, ADB, and the consultants will be held in Lahore following the \nsubmission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports.  \n \n18.  Initial participatory workshops will be held in the project districts to discuss the results of the \nlivelihoods analysis, the selection criteria for project subdistricts, and the initial rural development \ninitiatives with beneficiaries, other aid agencies, NGOs, district governments, and ADB. Additional \nworkshops will be held in Lahore, Rawalpindi, and other locations in the Punjab at different stages \nof TA implementation to discuss the consultants\u2019 recommendations for the project design. \n   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Pakistan for preparing the Sustainable Livelihood in Barani Areas Project (Punjab), \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \nanalysis?  Yes  partnership agreement?  Yes \n   \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: The incidence of poverty in the Punjab (33%) is \nsignificantly higher in the rural areas (36%) than in the urban areas (25.5%). Moreover, data from the 1990s show that \nrural poverty has increased faster (26.5% in 1993). In terms of social indicators, over 75% of the rural poor are \nreported to be illiterate, with a small proportion of literate women; gross primary enrollment rates show that over 40% \nof rural girls are not enroled in schools, more than twice the percentage for boys. Infant mortality in rural areas is \nreported at 106 per 1000 live births compared with 70 per 1000 live births in urban areas, and is higher than the \naverage for Pakistan (89/1000). There is a strong correlation between mothers\u2019 level of education and infant mortality, \nwith infants born to least educated mothers having twice the risk of dying within the first year after birth compared with \nthose of more educated women. \nThe Government has assigned high priority to development of the productive sectors of the rural economy \u2013 \nprevention of natural resource and environmental degradation, provision of social and physical infrastructure (roads, \nwater), microfinance, social protection (food support, welfare), building partnerships with civil society, and governance \nreforms (decentralization, civil service, access to justice). The Asian Development Bank's (ADB) poverty reduction \nstrategy describes poverty as a deprivation of essential assets and opportunities to which every human being is \nentitled. In line with the ADB strategy, the rural development activities examined in the technical assistance (TA) build \non the Government\u2019s efforts, with a core element of providing literacy/education for women in parallel with improving \naccess to opportunities for growth in agriculture and livestock, efficient water and natural resource management, \nnonfarm employment, and road infrastructure, with leading roles for civil society organizations, the private sector, and \nlocal governments. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification:  CPI \n \nWhile the project areas include the most deprived districts in the Punjab, earlier projects have shown that targeting of \nsmall farmers and women was not achieved and project benefits did not reach the poor. It has therefore been \nconsidered essential that a strong understanding of the poverty environment and of poor households be developed \nbefore embarking on project design. This encompasses a two-pronged approach within the context of a livelihood \nanalysis \u2013 preparation of poverty studies, and sector and thematic papers. The poverty studies will profile the \ncharacteristics of poverty and of the poor households through small sample household income and expenditure \nsurveys, in-depth household interviews and participatory poverty assessments on a gender disaggregated basis. Area \nspecific and gender-disaggregated poverty targeting indicators will be developed for use in the design of project \ninterventions aimed at the poor. The sector and thematic papers, based on desk research and supplemented where \nneeded by field work, will examine employment and incomes; natural resource systems, including common property \nand asset ownership by women; social structures and conditions, with particular emphasis on gender; the road \nnetwork;  environmental  issues;  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  the  private  sector;  and  an  institutional \nassessment of government focusing on decentralization. \n \n   \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis.  The TA will, using participatory approaches, include (i) a social assessment (social, political, \nand economic relations of associations; inequality; local elites; patronage; group organizations) including gender \nrelations and asset ownership by women and titling; and (ii) an assessment of communities and formal institutions \n(government, private, civil society organizations) and the strengths of institutions, their role and scope. Separate \nassessments will be carried out for NGOs in the project districts, including participatory assessment of their outreach \nto different social strata and to women, and of provincial and district government at all levels, particularly in the context \nof decentralization. Together with the poverty studies, the assessments of social, NGO, and government institutions \nwill provide the basis for recommendations on roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders as well as their \ncapacity-building needs. \nExtensive stakeholder consultations will be used in the TA. Workshops, focus group discussions, and appropriate \nmedia including information technology will be used in the consultations. The workshops will be held in the project \ndistricts to discuss results of the livelihood analysis and assessments, the selection criteria for project subdistricts, and \nthe development initiatives. Project area communities, NGOs, women\u2019s groups, district governments, government \nrepresentatives, and ADB will participate. \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n \nThe TA will indicate, as part of the project design, the modalities for adopting a process approach in participatory \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring \u2014 clearly indicating how the district government will adapt to a facilitation \nrole.    \n \n \nParticipation strategy? No \n \nD.         Gender and Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Functional literacy will be provided in all barani districts, giving women a \nbetter opportunity to participate in project preparation through improved access to information and ultimately to loan \nfunds. Comprehensive gender analysis will lead to mainstreaming gender throughout the proposed project. \n \nA gender plan in line with the Gender Reform Action Plan (TA 3832) will  be required and prepared during TA \nimplementation. \n \nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n       \nSignificant/    Plan \nNonsignificant/  Strategy to Address Issues  Required \nNone   \nResettlement  None  The  interventions  being  examined  under  the  TA  will  not  Not \nrequire any element of land acquisition, except under road  likely \n  improvements; road alignments normally being away from \ndwellings, no involuntary settlement is likely. This will be \nscreened during the TA for all proposed interventions. \n \nIndigenous Peoples  None  An  important  marker  of  ethnic  distinction  in  Pakistan  is  No \nlanguage, and the Population Census provides data along \n  those lines: The majority of the population in Punjab are \nPunjabis with small numbers of Seraki, Urdu, and Pushto \nspeakers; people belonging to the latter linguistic groups are \nby no means disadvantaged or would be adversely affected \nby  the  proposed  project,  as  language  does  not  imply \ndiscrimination of any sort.
