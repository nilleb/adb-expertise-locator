It will contribute to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  its  Cambodia \nMillennium Development Goal targets of improved rural water supply \ncoverage by 50% and improved rural sanitation coverage by 30% by \n2015, and its long-term sector targets of 100% improved water supply \nand  sanitation  coverage  by  2025.  The  Project  will  support  current \ninstitutional reform for improved service delivery in the sector, including \nproject  management,  through  (i)  a  subnational-level  capacity \ndevelopment program, and (ii) an enhanced partnership between the \nprovincial  departments  of  rural  development  (PDRDs)  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). It will also link to public financial \nmanagement activities for rural development.  \n \nThe Project will support the provision of improved RWSS services for \nabout 377,000 residents, of which 290,000 will benefit from improved \nsanitation facilities in 400 villages in 40 communes. The 40 communes \nare located in 16 districts in the six provinces of Banteay Meanchey, \nBattambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem \nReap. The Project will cover 100% of all villages in each commune and \nwill aim to achieve 100% water supply and 75% physical sanitation \ncoverage in each commune. The Project is a sector investment project \nwith the following outputs (i) improved community health and hygiene \npractices through community mobilization and action; (ii) rehabilitated, \nupgraded, and developed water supply facilities in 40 communes; (iii) \nimproved public and household sanitation facilities; (iv) a stronger and \nmore  sustainable  RWSS  sector  through  support  to  private  sector \ndevelopment and improved monitoring of RWSS coverage; and (v) \nimproved capacity for project implementation. \n   \nRationale  Cambodia is almost entirely rural, with more than 80% of the total \npopulation  living  in  rural  areas.  A  focus  on  rural  development, \ninfrastructure,  and  delivery  of  basic  services  is  the  first  step  in \naccelerating  poverty  reduction,  reducing  regional  inequalities,  and \nsupporting inclusive growth. In 2007, about 55.4% of the rural population \nhad access to improved sources of water, while only 19.6% had access \nto improved sanitation facilities. Rural residents spend considerable \ntime,  energy,  and  financial  resources  acquiring  their  daily  drinking \nwater from distant water sources, rainwater collection, or having it \ndelivered to their homes. The type of water supply and sanitation \n ", "ii   \nfacilities available to households are important determinants of the \nhealth status of household members and children. Diarrhea is a major \ncause of child morbidity and mortality, which can be reduced through \nsafe and clean water and proper hygienic and sanitation practices. An \nintensified focus on RWSS will help improve health and accelerate \npoverty reduction, especially around the Tonle Sap Basin, where most \nof Cambodia's poorest live. An integrated approach to RWSS will also \ncontribute to gender equity and livelihood improvements.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is to expand access to improved RWSS \nnationwide, and to better the health of rural households in the project \nprovinces. It will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve the \nCambodia Millennium Development Goal targets for RWSS in 2015 \nand sector goals in 2025 by increasing access to improved rural water \nsupply  from  55.4%  in  2007  to  75.0%  in  2020  and  by  providing \nimproved sanitation from 19.6% of rural households in 2007 to 50.0% \nin 2020. It will also contribute to reducing under-5 child mortality by an \naverage of 20 deaths per 1,000 live births in each province by 2020. \nThe outcome of the Project is to improve access to water supply for \nabout 377,000 rural residents and sanitation for about 290,000 rural \nresidents in an estimated 400 villages in 40 communes.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $25.8  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of about $1.7 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A grant of $21 million will be provided from the Asian Development Fund.  \n \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  21.0    81.4 \nGovernment  1.8    7.0 \nBeneficiaries  3.0    11.6 \n  Total      25.8    100.0 \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) \n   \nImplementation  MRD will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A national project \nArrangements  steering committee, chaired by the MRD secretary of state, will provide \noverall project direction and guidance. The project management unit \nfor  the  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Tonle  Sap  Rural \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Project in the Department of Rural \nWater Supply of MRD will be expanded into a project coordination unit \nand  will  be  responsible  for  overall  planning,  coordination,  and \nmanagement  of  the  Project.  The  provincial  rural  development \ncommittee (or its appointed equivalent) will provide project direction \nand  guidance  for  the  subproject  in  each  project  province  and \ncoordinate  provincial  agencies.  A  PDRD  project  team  will  be \nresponsible for coordinating key activities in the provinces. The district \nofficer of rural development will assist in coordinating daily subproject \nimplementation in each commune. \n   ", "  iii\nProcurement  Goods,  works,  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  and  national  competitive  bidding  procedures \nacceptable to ADB and those described in the agreed procurement \nplan. Equipment and material packages valued at $100,000 equivalent \nor more may be procured under national competitive bidding, and \nthose  below  $100,000  through  shopping.  Works  contracts  will  be \nawarded under national competitive bidding procedures, due to the \nsmall size of contracts. Works contracts for household sanitation with a \ntotal  value  of  $5,000  equivalent  or  less  can  be  procured  at  the \ncommune level and will follow community participation in procurement \nin accordance with ADB procedure in implementing small projects with \ncommunity participation. \n   \nConsulting Services  All consultants financed from the proceeds of the grant will be recruited \nin  line  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Consulting services will include recruitment \nof (i) a consulting firm for project implementation assistance, (ii) an \ninternational  or  national  NGO  to  supply  national  facilitators  for \ncommunity  development  and  project  implementation  assistance,  (iii) \nservice  contracts  for  12  specialists  in  RWSS  and  community \ndevelopment (as needed), and (iv) an international NGO for monitoring \nand evaluation. The firm will include consulting services for 338 person-\nmonths, of which 56 person-months (4 international specialists) and 282 \nperson-months (14 national specialists) to assist in project management, \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure, social development, community driven development, and \nresettlement and environment safeguards. The firm will be hired using \nquality- and cost-based selection and following the standard quality\u2013ratio \nof 80:20. The PCU will also recruit an international or national NGO for \n756 person-months to supply 18 national facilitators, and an international \nNGO for monitoring and evaluation for 24 person-months. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project is expected to benefit rural residents in 40 communes by \nBeneficiaries  providing  access  to  improved  water  supply,  increasing  health  and \nhygiene awareness, and improving public and household sanitation. \nAbout 50% of all beneficiaries are expected to be poor. The Project will \nhave direct impact on the health and livelihoods of the communities in \nthese villages. Residents will benefit from improved health and reduced \nmedical  expenditures,  as  the  water  will  be  potable.  Water-  and \nsanitation-related diseases contribute significantly to the poor health \nstatus of many women and children, including high infant mortality rates \nin these areas. Provision of sanitation facilities in schools, for instance, \nwill improve the public health of students and help reinforce community \nhygiene messages. Clean water and sanitation is particularly important \nfor  women,  who  are  primarily  responsible  for  water  collection  and \nstorage to meet daily household needs and family health. Women spend \nup to 3 hours per day collecting and storing water. Improved access to \nwater supply and sanitation also increases the rate of child survival, \nwhich is a precursor to the demographic transition to lower fertility rates. \nFewer children help to reduce women's household responsibilities and \nincrease their opportunities for personal development.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Institutional and Governance Risks. Potential risks include (i) changes \nto  the  decentralization  and  deconcentration  processes  following  the \napproval of the Organic Law in April 2008, (ii) challenges at the national \n ", "iv   \nand subnational level in moving away from project implementation units \nto project teams in the PDRD, and (iii) ensuring proper provincial-level \nfinancial  management  controls.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  actions  are \nincluded in the Project to (i) inform key stakeholders at the national and \nsubnational  levels  about  the  Project  and  its  alignment  with  the \ndecentralization and deconcentration processes to date; (ii) coordinate \nclosely  with  other  ADB-supported  projects  that  aim  to  strengthen \nsubnational-level capacity; (iii) coordinate regularly with the Ministry of \nInterior  about  the  decentralization  and  deconcentration  process;  (iv) \nensure that existing implementation and fund-flow arrangements remain \nunchanged from the time of project processing; (v) allow for a review of \nthe existing implementation arrangements within 30 months of grant \neffectiveness; (vi) recruit NGO staff members to work with the PDRD \nproject team rather than contract out activities; and (vii) recruit local \naccountants and financial management specialists to support the PDRD \nproject teams during project implementation, and to link to ongoing \nactivities  under  public  financial  management  for  rural  development \n(which includes MRD). A good governance framework is also prepared \nand has been agreed to with MRD. \n \nTechnical Risks. For some villages\u2014especially those where surface \nand  shallow  groundwater  is  of  poor  quality  due  to  high  content  of \narsenic, iron, or other pollutants, or where the water table is low\u2014finding \nan appropriate and affordable technical solution may be difficult. To \nmitigate this risk, mechanisms have been incorporated in the project \ndesign to include (i) requiring an initial environmental screening in each \nvillage before the communities can finalize a village water supply and \nsanitation  plan;  (ii)  completing  groundwater  testing  as  part  of  the \ncontractor's bid (up to 100 meters); (iii) providing a provisional budget for \ngroundwater testing in certain areas (between 100 and 200 meters); (iv) \nincluding a range of water supply technologies (e.g., protected ponds \nwith filtration) in the project design to allow for alternative options to a \ngroundwater source; and (v) training at least two persons (50% women) \nfrom  each  water  and  sanitation  user  group  in  operation  and \nmaintenance of water supply facilities. \n \nSector Risks. There are several sector initiatives planned that will help \nsupport a sector-wide approach in RWSS. A national rural water supply, \nsanitation,  and  hygiene  strategy  for  2010\u20132025  and  implementation \nguidelines will be prepared after the Project is approved. ADB is one of \nthree  development  partners  jointly  supporting  the  strategy  and \nguidelines  development.  To  mitigate  this  risk  and  ensure  that  the \nproposed sector strategy and  Project are consistent,  the  Project (i) \nsupports  continued  dialogue  and  coordination  with  development \npartners during project implementation through the Technical Working \nGroup for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene; and (ii) includes \nan assurance for the approval of the strategy and guidelines. \n ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n(the Project). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  More than 80% of Cambodia\u2019s total population (estimated at 13.4 million people) lives in \nrural areas.1 Thus, rural development, infrastructure creation, and delivery of basic services are \nthe first steps in accelerating poverty reduction, reducing regional inequalities, and supporting \ninclusive growth. In 2007, about 55.4% of the rural population had access to improved sources of \nwater,  and  only  19.6%  had  access  to  sanitation  facilities.2 The  type  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities available to households are important determinants of the health status of its \nmembers. Exposure to major childhood diseases, such as diarrhea, can be reduced through \nproper  hygiene  and  sanitation  practices,  as  such  illnesses  are  often  related  to  the  use  of \ncontaminated water and to unhygienic practices. Dehydration, caused by severe diarrhea but \neasily treated, is a major cause of child morbidity and mortality. According to the 2005 Cambodia \nDemographic and Health Survey,3 infant mortality in rural areas decreased from 92 deaths to 76 \ndeaths per 1,000 live births from 2000 to 2005, respectively. Under-5 child mortality in rural areas \ndecreased from 126 deaths to 111 deaths per 1,000 live births from 2000 to 2005, respectively. \nThe decrease is attributed to a number of reasons, including improved access to health facilities, \nand increased access to improved water supply and sanitation for rural households. \n \n3.  Rural residents spend considerable time, energy, and financial resources acquiring their \ndaily drinking water from distant water sources, rainwater collection, or having it delivered to their \nhomes. The percent of rural residents that have access to improved water sources increases \nfrom the dry to the rainy season, as rural households rely more on rainwater collection (footnote \n3). About 57% of rural households boil water before drinking, while 36% do nothing due to lack of \nawareness,  and  the  remaining  use  a  household  water  filter  (ceramic,  sand,  or  other).  The \neffectiveness of household water filtration by rural households varies, as some do not use or \nmaintain the filter regularly. Women and girls spend an average of 3 hours per day collecting and \nstoring water for drinking and other domestic purposes, as the average distance to the nearest \nwater source is about 300 meters in the dry season.  \n \n4.  The Project will focus on rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) to help improve health \nand  accelerate  poverty  reduction\u2014especially  around  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  where  most  of \nCambodia's poorest live.4 Here, the majority of households rely on self-provision of drinking and \ndomestic water through groundwater extraction, use of surface water, or rainwater collection \nduring the rainy season. Sanitation is limited to simple on-site facilities, with the majority of the \npopulation defecating in the open (about 9 million people). An integrated RWSS approach will also \ncontribute to gender equity due to increased time-savings and livelihood improvements in the \nvillages around the Tonle Sap Basin. A design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n1  National Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Planning. 2008.

Cambodia has achieved a degree of stability following decades of conflict, but had a \nhigh poverty rate of 30.1% nationwide and 35.8% in rural areas in 2007. According to the 2008 \ncensus (footnote 1), the six provinces around the Tonle Sap Basin had a combined population of \n4.10 million people, of which 84.4% (or 3.46 million people) lived in rural areas. The poverty rate \n(headcount) ranged from 33.7% in Battambang Province to a high of 52.4% in Kampong Thom \nProvince.5 Although Cambodia recorded a significant annual average economic growth rate of \n11.1% from 2004 to 2007, this growth was narrowly focused on the garment, construction, and \ntourism sectors. Since 2005, Cambodia has been ranked 131 out of 177 countries in terms of \nquality  of  life.6 The  impact  of  the  current  global  economic  crisis  will  no  doubt  be  felt  by \nCambodia\u2019s rural population, as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicts a 2.1% economic \ngrowth rate for 2009.7 Provincial profiles are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n6.  In 2007, the overall access rate to improved water supply was 60.4% and to sanitation \nwas  27.6%,  while  in  rural  areas,  it  was  55.4%  and  19.6%,  respectively.  Although  access \nincreased from 24.0% and 8.6%, respectively, from 1998, the current coverage figures are \nsubject to discussion due to changing definitions used in monitoring achievement toward the \nCambodia Millennium Development Goal (CMDG). Further, it appears that the CMDG target for \nrural  water  supply  has  been  achieved;  however,  disparities  in  RWSS  coverage  in  the  six \nprovinces around the Tonle Sap Basin indicate that the Government of Cambodia is far from \nachieving the CMDG targets at the provincial levels. In 2007, access to improved water was the \nlowest in Banteay Meanchey Province at just 17.2% and highest in Siem Reap Province at \n33.2% (Table 1).  \nTable 1: Provincial Profiles of Six Project Provinces \n \n      Under-5  Under-5 yr  Infant       \n      Year  with  Mortality       \n  Access  Access to  Mortality  Diarrhea in  Rate per       \n  to  Sanitation  Rate per  2 Weeks  1,000       \n  Improved  Facilities  1,000 Live  Preceding  Live  Poverty  Poverty  Poverty \n  Water (%)  (%)  Births  the Surveya  Births  Rateb  Scoreb  Rankingc \nProvince  (2007)  (2007)  (2005)  (%) (2005)   (2005)  (2004)  (2007)  (2007) \nNationwide  60.4  27.6  83  20.0  66  35.13     \n(Total) \nNationwide  55.4  19.6  111  20.1  92       \n(Rural) \nKampong  29.8  12.4  106  25.0  87  52.40  100.75  15 \nThom \nKampong  24.5  3.5  101  16.9  87  39.57  99.40  8 \nChhnang  \nPursat  23.3  8.7  106  24.8  86  39.57  100.94  16 \nBattambang   27.0  30.0  116  18.3  97  33.69  100.22  10 \nSiem Reap   33.2  9.7  94  14.3  67  51.84  100.68  14 \nBanteay  17.2  16.5  96  22.3  76  37.15  100.65  13 \nMeanchey  \na Provincial diarrhea figures is not differentiated by type of residence (i.e., rural or urban). \nb high score = high poverty. \nc Provinces ranked out of a total of 24 provinces, with the 24th ranked province being the poorest. \nNote: All figures quoted in this table are for rural areas unless stated.  \nSources: Nationwide figures: Ministry of Planning (MOP). 2008.

In Kbal Trach \n(Pursat) and Bos Sbov (Banteay Meanchey), common waterborne illnesses include cholera, \ndiarrhea, dysentery, and typhoid.9 In 2008, annual expenditure incurred by households for related \nmedical care was KR242,206 ($60.55) in Kbal Trach (approximately 5.95% of the total annual \nexpenditure or 5.87% of the average annual household income) and KR320,000 ($80.00) in Bos \nSbov (about 8% of the total annual expenditure or 7% of the average annual household income).  \n \n8.  While  infrastructure  investment  is  essential  for  increasing  the  coverage  of  sanitation \nfacilities, education on hygiene practices is a precondition for the improvement of public health. \nThe poor\u2014and particularly women, children, and the elderly\u2014are more vulnerable to illness from \nconsuming  poor-quality  water  and  from  repeating  poor  water  use  and  sanitation  practices. \nWomen's health is also impacted, as access to unclean water and unsafe hygiene practices \nincreases their workload, raises their risk of reproductive infections, and limits their ability to care \nfor their family. Changing health and hygiene behavior takes time and cannot be limited to \nsporadic awareness programs. Community ownership is also essential in sustaining behavior \nchange and improving health and hygiene.  \n \n9.  Government's  Sector  Policy  and  Investment  Plan.  ADB  RWSS  investment  in \nCambodia is based on the 2003 national policy on water supply and sanitation10 and the 2009 \nupdated RWSS sector investment plan for 2010\u20132025.11 The 2003 national policy envisions that \nevery person in rural communities will have sustained access to safe water supply and sanitation \nservices and will live in a hygienic environment by 2025. To help monitor this progress, the \nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD) estimates informal monitoring targets for improved rural \nwater supply access at 75% and for improved sanitation access at 50% by 2020. A national rural \nwater supply, sanitation, and hygiene strategy is under preparation and is due for approval by \nearly 2010. It is supported by ADB, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and World Bank's \nWater and Sanitation Program through the Technical Working Group for Rural Water Supply, \nSanitation, and Hygiene (TWG-RWSSH). A set of national implementation guidelines will follow \nonce the strategy is finalized. \n \n10.  The TWG-RWSSH, established in November 2007, is an interministerial working group \ncomprising senior representatives from government agencies and development partners active \nin the sector. It has coordinating and advisory roles for policy guidance, strategy and budget, \ncapacity development, and aid effectiveness. It meets quarterly and is chaired by the minister of \n                                                 \n8  Water and Sanitation Program. 2008.

Phnom Penh. \n ", "4   \nrural  development,  with  ADB  as  the  first  co-facilitator.  A  water  and  sanitation  (WATSAN) \nsectoral working group, chaired by director of the Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS), \nalso meets monthly to discuss initiatives in the RWSS sector.  \n \n11.  The Government considers RWSS to be an integral part of its overarching strategy for \nrural development and poverty reduction. It regards access to improved water supply in rural \nareas to be a key prerequisite for poverty reduction. The national strategic development plan \n(2006\u20132010),12 extended  to  2013  in  2008,  is  the  Government\u2019s  overarching  framework  for \nreducing poverty through economic growth. The plan reinforces the CMDGs, specifically Target \n7.10 to increase the proportion of the rural population with access to safe water from 24% in \n1998 to 50% in 2015, and Target 7.12 to increase the proportion of rural population with access \nto improved sanitation from 8.6% in 1996 to 30.0% in 2015.  \n \n12.  According to the updated RWSS sector investment plan, about $53.5 million in capital \ninvestment and $4.8 million in recurrent costs is required to reach these CMDGs. An estimated \n$50.0 million in capital investment has been committed to the sector from 2008 to 2015, leaving \na funding gap of $3.5 million.13 Of the $50.0 million, ADB will have provided more than 50% of \nthe  overall  financing  needs  from  2008  to  2015.  Total  capital  investment  to  attain  the \nGovernment\u2019s 100% coverage goal by 2025 is about $528 million, or $246 million from 2016 to \n2020 and $282 million from 2021 to 2025.14 External and government financing is also needed \nfor capacity development of RWSS staff, community hygiene education and awareness, and \nsanitation materials and equipment. A sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n13.  Sector Definitions and Service Levels. Targets in the CMDGs are originally presented \nin terms of access to \u201csafe\u201d water, but this changed in interpretation in 2003 to access to \n\u201cimproved\u201d water. National surveys and RWSS databases in Cambodia do not identify \u201csafe\u201d \nsources in terms of water quality; instead, they distinguish between improved and unimproved \nsupplies  or  facilities.  MRD  and  the  Ministry  of  Planning  (MOP)  have  adopted  the \nrecommendations  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  UNICEF  Joint  Monitoring \nProgramme on Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP)15 that an improved drinking water source is \ndefined as a drinking water source or delivery point that, by nature of its construction and design, \nis likely to protect the water source from outside contamination, particularly from fecal matter. \nAccess to water is enhanced if water is available from an improved source within 150 meters from \nthe user's dwelling. Adequate service levels are 20 liters per capita per day, all year, within 150 \nmeters of the source or to 25 households. Additionally, a household needs to store about 3,000 \nliters of rainwater to meet drinking and cooking water needs through the dry season. An improved \ndrinking water source includes (i) piped water to a dwelling, plot, or yard; (ii) a public tap or \nstandpipe; (iii) a drilled well; (iv) a protected (lined and covered) dug well; (v) a protected spring; \nand (vi) rainwater collection. Additionally, MRD and MOP consider protected ponds with filtration \nto be an improved drinking water source. \n \n14.  An improved sanitation facility is defined as one that hygienically separates human feces \nfrom human contact. MRD and MOP use the classifications suggested by JMP to differentiate \nimproved sanitation facilities. Sanitation facilities are not considered improved when shared with \nother households or when open for public use. Improved sanitation facilities include (i) flush or \n                                                 \n12  Government of Cambodia. 2006. National Strategic Development Plan (2006\u20132010).

MRD notes that a dry-pit latrine is \nconsidered improved if it has a concrete ring-lined pit. \n \n15.  MRD tests the water quality of all water supply points constructed in accordance with \nWHO and  Cambodian guidelines, including initial site testing for six physical and chemical \nparameters16 and one test for the presence of fecal coliforms. Water samples are tested at the \ntime of drilling, and then water quality tests are completed against the full 16 parameters (as \napproved  by  Cambodian  national  water  quality  standards)  at  the  handover  of  the  wells  to \ncommunities. Findings are recorded in the MRD RWSS database, previously established under \nthe Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (TSRWSSP).17  \n \n16.  Key  Sector  Institutions.  MRD  is  responsible  for  RWSS.  Within  MRD,  DRWS  is \nresponsible  for  rural  water  supply,  and  the  Department  of  Rural  Health  Care  (DRHC)  is \nresponsible for rural sanitation and hygiene. Water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs) are \nvillage groups, comprising about 20\u201325 households, which are formed for each water supply \nfacility or water point. Each WSUG elects a five-person board (of which 40% are women) to \noperate and maintain each water supply facility. District technical officers support WSUGs in \noperation and maintenance (O&M), including water quality testing and monitoring. The Ministry of \nIndustry, Mines and Energy is responsible for urban water supply and for regulating the private \nsector in piped water supply systems. In 2005, a memorandum of understanding between MRD \nand the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy helped clarify the overlap between the two \nministries regarding piped water systems; MRD is thus responsible for community systems of \n250 households or less. The Council for Agriculture and Rural Development also coordinates with \nMRD and other ministries involved in the Government's priority sectors of agriculture and rural \ndevelopment.  The  Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  in  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  is \ndeveloping a national environmental health action plan in cooperation with other line ministries \nand the DHRC director is the co-chair of the subtechnical working group in MOH. MOP is \nresponsible for (i) guiding and managing national socioeconomic development planning, (ii) the \nGovernment\u2019s  statistical  functions,  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  implementing  plans  and  national \nprograms in all sectors, including the achievement toward the CMDGs targets for RWSS. \n \n17.  ADB Country Strategy and Program. ADB's long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020) recognizes that a lack of effective infrastructure undermines the well being of rural \ncommunities  and  notes  the  need  to  continue  to  invest  in  rural  infrastructure.18 The  country \noperations business plan for Cambodia 2008\u2013201019 focuses on enhancing rural development to \nfoster more pro-poor growth and to accelerate poverty reduction, especially around the Tonle Sap \nBasin. It includes interventions for increasing the poor's access to RWSS, while strengthening \nlocal community capacity in the management of facilities. The ongoing TSRWSSP is one of the \nbest-performing projects in ADB's Cambodia portfolio based on the project performance report. \nADB support to the RWSS sector is (i) embedded into its overarching commitment to support the \nGovernment achieve its CMDGs; (ii) justified, as more than 80% of the total population lives in the \nrural area; and (iii) complementary to the delivery of water supply and sanitation services along \nthe economic corridors and in the border towns. The Project (i) complements existing ADB \ncapacity  development  activities  under  the  Tonle  Sap  initiative  and  the  public  financial \n                                                 \n16 Includes total dissolved solids, turbidity, pH, iron, and arsenic with either fluoride or manganese additional options. \n17 ADB. 2005.

The Project is in the country \noperations business plan as a grant project for 2009. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n18.  Transfer of Functions from MRD to Subnational Levels Remains Unclear. The roles \nand responsibilities of line agencies in relation to service delivery, the Ministry of Interior, and \ncommune councils remain unclear. MRD is responsible for rural development, including RWSS, \nthrough its line agencies; however, MRD is not represented at the commune level and relies on \nthe district officer of rural development for outreach activities. Moreover, the Ministry of Interior is \nresponsible for the administration of subnational organizations through its network of selected \nheads of provinces and districts and elected heads of communes and villages. Once commune \ninvestment  plans  are  submitted  to  the  provinces,  the  district  organizes  a  district  integration \nworkshop to review and discuss the submitted plans.21 While the Organic Law (2008) requires \ngreater participation of the subnational structure, including commune councils, implementation \nprakas (subdecrees) are not yet in place to support implementation. The Project aims to work \nwithin the broad decentralization and deconcentration framework, with a comprehensive review of \nthe  implementation  arrangements  completed  during  midterm  review.  It  will  also  support \ninstitutional reform for improved RWSS service delivery.  \n \n19.  Limited  Focus  on  Rehabilitation.  A  limited  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  water  supply \nfacilities contributed to the TSRWSSP inability to reach its initial coverage targets. Failure to \nrehabilitate facilities may be attributed to a lack of (i) clarity over the legal ownership of water \nfacilities, and (ii) government financing for O&M (or recurrent costs). During project preparation, \nabout 5% of the 300,000 water facilities found in eight northwest provinces of Cambodia (six \nProject provinces, Oddar Meanchey, and Preah Vihear) are inoperative. If half of the facilities are \nrehabilitated, close to 300,000 households (or 1.5 million people) could be provided with access to \nan  improved  water  source.22   Total  Government  allocation  for  rehabilitation  of  water  supply \nfacilities in 2009 is about $0.439 million\u2014about $4.4 million short of the amount estimated in the \nupdated sector investment plan. The Project prioritizes rehabilitation and upgrading of existing \nwater facilities prior to grant disbursement for construction of any new water facility. MRD has \nprioritized rehabilitation and issued a letter to the provincial governors to help clarify the legal \nownership and responsibility of water facility O&M in rural areas.  \n \n20.  Limited  Government  Budget  for  the  Sector.  The  limited  Government  budget  will \nprevent it from achieving the CMDG targets for RWSS by 2015 and its sector goals by 2025. \nAlthough current budget allocation levels are increasing, the levels are insufficient to cover the \ntotal investment required. The national budget allocation from 2008 to 2009 increased by 77% for \nrural water supply from about $0.443 million to $0.784 million, and increased by 52% for rural \nsanitation from about $0.174 million to $0.265 million. The level of actual expenditure for RWSS \nranges from 97% to 100% of the total budget allocated to MRD. The Government recently \nincreased its commitment to the sector by allocating $18.6 million from the International Monetary \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2007.

", "    7 \nFund Debt Relief Fund for RWSS development in 13 provinces. The Project will complement the \nGovernment's current investment levels, support MRD to improve its overall planning and budget \nin the sector, and emphasize rehabilitation of existing water facilities.  \n \n21.  Limited Private Sector Participation. Increased access to improved RWSS facilities, \nparticularly household latrines, relies heavily on the private sector. District- and commune-level \nentrepreneurs are keen to manufacture sanitation parts and to construct water supply facilities, \nbut they usually lack the basic knowledge and equipment. Further, more established contracting \nfirms, with their own well drilling rigs, lack competent rig supervisors, and some rigs have limited \nperformance. Although DRWS has established a licensing system for drilling companies, which \nprequalifies them to bid on TSRWSSP contracts, there is room for improvement in terms of \nindependent qualification of rig supervisors and certification of equipment. The Project will \nsupport  private  sector  participation,  especially  small  businesses,  in  construction  and \nmanagement of RWSS facilities through training and capacity development activities. \n \n22.  High Percentage of Negative Wells. A high percentage of negative wells are possible \nwhen groundwater conditions are unpredictable in many locations, and drilling contractors are not \npaid for low or nonyielding wells. As a result, contractors place a supplementary price on all wells \nto cover the cost of wells drilled for which they may not get paid\u2014increasing the unit cost of \nsuccessful wells and clouding the data on unsuccessful wells. Out of the 3,441 constructed drilled \nwells under the TSRWSSP, 2,899 wells were successful and 542 wells were abandoned. This \nassumed high failure rate of 15.75% is comparable to the rate of 12.50% in the Essarn region of \nThailand.23 The Project will support improved well-drilling technology by encouraging suppliers of \nwell-drilling consumables (drilling fluids, lubricants, well screens and drill bits) to promote their \nproducts in Cambodia through \u201con-the-drilling-rig\u201d training to rig operators. It will also encourage \ngroundwater testing (to 100 meters) be completed as part of the contractor's bid. The Project \nincludes a provisional budget for groundwater testing in difficult areas (ranging from 100 to 200 \nmeters deep), where contractors do not have the expertise or equipment. Data will be recorded in \nthe existing groundwater database previously established under the TSRWSSP. \n \n23.  Need for Improved Coordination between DRWS and DHRC. DRWS and DRHC are \nboth engaged in sanitation and hygiene promotion, which has led to different approaches in \nhousehold  sanitation.  In  part,  these  divisions  have  been  exasperated  by  the  alignment  of \ndevelopment partners toward either rural water supply or rural sanitation. An integrated approach \nto water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and community health is essential to the success of each. \nThe TSRWSSP is attempting to bring the two departments together,24 but the recent geographical \nseparation of DRWS and DRHC has added to the problem. While the DRWS compound is an \nideal site for the storage of materials and equipment, it is out of the mainstream of MRD activity \nand  limits  coordination  between  the  two  departments.  To  improve  coordination,  MRD  has \nappointed one deputy director of DRHC and two staff members to work full-time in the project \ncoordination unit (PCU) at DRWS. The director of DRHC will continue to serve as a member of \nthe project steering committee and advisor on sanitation activities. \n \n24.  Unclear Parameters in Selecting Water Supply Options. The menu of water supply \ntechnical options under the TSRWSSP has been reviewed to determine whether communities \nselected  options  based  on  affordability  or  preference.  The  menu  contained  seven  options, \n                                                 \n23  Well-drillers in the Essarn region report a negative well rate of 12.5% using sophisticated equipment, groundwater \ndata, and expertise. The region shares the same complex hydrogeological regime as the Tonle Sap Basin. \n24  Actions included (i) seconding two staff members from DRHC as members of the project management unit, \nincluding the DHRC director as the sanitation advisor to the project management unit; and (ii) promoting the role of \nthe DRHC director as a member of the project steering committee.  \n ", "8   \nalthough the most common selected was drilled wells. The parameters for selecting one option \nover another were unclear. The Project clarifies these parameters25 and emphasizes improved \nwater management at the source, during transport, and in the home.  \n \n25.  Need to Refine the Sanitation Approach. Sanitation coverage in some TSRWSSP \nvillages averaged only about 20%. The pour-flush latrine was the most common type of latrine \nselected, but it also required the highest level of household contribution (60% of the total cost). \nOut of the 37,172 latrines contracted, about 73% was either a water-sealed or pour-flush latrine. \nIn fact, many villagers opted to remain without a latrine until they could afford to contribute their \nshare of the cost. The sanitation cost-sharing ladder that was developed for the TSRWSSP \nincluded 10 design options of four basic toilet types\u2014dry-pit, ventilation improved pit, water-\nsealed, and pour-flush. A review found that this sanitation ladder may have been a barrier to \nhousehold sanitation improvements, as the cost of the superstructure was calculated as part of \nthe total latrine cost. The Project will support MRD's vision of informed choice for sanitation, and \nprovide a sanitation grant to each household covering the cost of an improved and hygienic dry-\npit latrine with a concrete ring-lined pit (subground structure only). The sanitation grant may be \napplied  to  the  construction  of  a  water-sealed  or  a  pour-flush  latrine  based  on  household \npreference and affordability levels.  \n \n26.  The  Project  will  also  draw  elements  from  the  community-led  total  sanitation  (CLTS) \napproach followed by project support for latrine construction.26 Key findings from an evaluation \nshowed that CLTS (i) is effective but generally in the dry season, (ii) promotes behavior change, \nand (iii) contributes to institutional capacity building.27 It also found that CLTS is not sustainable in \nsome areas, as the commonly-built latrine (unlined dry-pit) is not durable and is prone to failure \nfrom flooding, loose soil conditions, termites and ants, and constant use. While CLTS advocates \nno subsidies for latrine construction, DRHC believes that (i) support is required to help sustain the \nbehavior-change  aspects  and  to  overcome  the  social,  economic,  technical,  and  institutional \nbarriers to the construction of sanitation facilities; (ii) support for latrine construction may start \nbefore a village achieves 100% open defecation-free status, as there is a \"learning by seeing\" \neffect; and (iii) the total cost of the latrine should not include the cost of the superstructure. The \nTSRWSSP  incorporated  sanitation  and  hygiene  messages  into  its  community  mobilization \nactivities. The Project will continue this effort and has opted to employ a CLTS\u2013hybrid approach. \nDetails are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n27.  Limited Role of Women in the Sector. Under the TSRWSSP, structural changes\u2014which \ncould influence sanitation behavior and support men to accept women\u2019s stronger roles in decision \nmaking and planning\u2014have had limited success to date. While women officially comprise at least \ntwo positions in the five-person WSUG boards, real decision making is limited to the socially \naccepted  domain  of  village  leaders  (who  are  mostly  older,  literate  men).  Further,  female \nilliteracy\u2014about  43%  of  women  in  Cambodia  are  illiterate\u2014remains  a  core  constraint  to \nparticipation  in  technical  aspects  of  community-managed  procurement.  The  TSRWSSP \ndeveloped several visual materials for education and instruction. The Project will continue to \npromote and encourage women's role in the sector through peer-to-peer communications and \nprovide support to commune council committees for women and children (which will support the \nProject's sanitation and behavior-change initiatives). \n                                                 \n25 For instance, household filters are provided when a protected pond with filtration is selected. Two jumbo jars with lids \nand taps are provided when rainwater collection systems are selected. \n26  In Cambodia, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, UNICEF, and World Bank's WSP \nare partners that support CLTS and nonsubsidy approaches.  \n27  Sok, K. and Catalla, R.N.F. 2009.Community-Led Total Sanitation in Cambodia: Final Evaluation Report. Phnom \nPenh: UNICEF. ", "    9 \n \n28.  Need for Improved Coordination with MOH. Limited coordination between MRD and \nMOH in monitoring health impacts of RWSS is largely due to health districts (or operational \ndistricts) not coinciding geographically with the administrative districts of the province. MOH, at the \nsubhealth district level, also does not follow commune boundaries with the subdistrict subdivision. \nThe monitoring of RWSS coverage and community health improvements, specifically water and \nsanitation-related diseases, will be an important aspect of the project performance management \nsystem (PPMS). The TSRWSSP supported the development of the PPMS, but the collection of \nhealth data has been limited. The Project, therefore, will support mechanisms for improving the \nmonitoring  of  health  impacts,  including  early  coordination  with  the  MOH;  identification  of \nappropriate health centers nearest to the selected communes; and recruitment of an international \nnongovernment organization (NGO) to collect baseline, midterm, and final project data. \n \n29.  Key Lessons in the Sector. Lessons are drawn from RWSS and other projects in rural \ndevelopment, including the TSRWSSP and the Northwest Rural Development Project.28 The \nProject,  building  on  the  TSRWSSP  design,  increases  support  to  strengthen  project  staff  in \ncommunity outreach activities focused on effective behavior change linked to water management \nand sanitation practices. It emphasizes consolidating village water supply and sanitation plans into \nsubproject  commune  feasibility  studies  for  better  design,  selection  of  technical  options,  and \nimplementation.  It  also  strengthens  the  capacity  of  district  officers  of  rural  development  in \ncoordinating activities at the commune and village levels. It supports the decentralization and \ndeconcentration process by strengthening NGO\u2013provincial department of rural development (i.e., \nPDRD) partnerships to support activities at the commune, village, and household levels. It also \nencourages private sector participation in construction of water supply and sanitation facilities. \nThe Project focuses on rehabilitation of failed or inefficient water facilities as a cost-effective \nmeans of achieving greater service coverage. It promotes improved water safety and use in three \nstages\u2014at  the  water  source,  during  transport,  and  in  the  home\u2014and  better  sanitation  and \nhygiene practices in the home, schools, and health facilities. Additional lessons are listed in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \n30.  Key Development Partners in the Sector. ADB is a key player in investing in RWSS \ninfrastructure  development  with  the  ongoing  TSRWSSP  and  other  rural  development  and \nagricultural projects. ADB served as first lead facilitator of the TWG-RWSSH. Together with the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom, UNICEF, and World Bank's \nWater and Sanitation Program, ADB is supporting the development of a national RWSS and \nhygiene  strategy.  The  Government  has  allocated  $18.6  million\u2014about  23%  of  the  total \nInternational Monetary Fund debt relief initiative ($82 million) to support a RWSS project in 13 \nprovinces following the original TSRWSSP project design. The World Bank-supported RWSS \nactivities under its Northeast Village Development Project and its Water and Sanitation Program \nsupports sector studies, showcases best practices, provides small-scale technical assistance, and \nsupports  preparation of a water supply and sanitation sector investment plan for urban and rural \nareas. UNICEF supports RWSS improvements and CLTS. Other partners include the WHO and \nseveral international and national NGOs. External assistance to the sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2001.

The impact of the Project is to expand access to improved RWSS nationwide, and to \nbetter  the  health  of  rural  households  in  the  project  provinces.  It  will  contribute  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts in achieving the CMDG targets for RWSS in 2015 and sector goals in 2025 \nby increasing access to improved rural water supply from 55.4% in 2007 to 75.0% in 2020 and \nimproved sanitation from 19.6% in 2007 to 50.0% in 2020. It will reduce under-5 child mortality by \nan average of 20 deaths per 1,000 live births in each project province. The outcome of the \nProject is to improve access to water supply for about 377,000 rural residents and sanitation for \nabout 290,000 rural residents in an estimated 400 villages in 40 communes.  \n \n32.  The Project will continue ADB's assistance in increasing access to improved RWSS in the \nfive original provinces under the TSRWSSP (Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, \nPursat, and Siem Reap). With the additional financing available, the Project will expand into an \nadditional province, Banteay Meanchey. The 40 communes are located in 16 districts, six of which \noverlap with the TSRWSSP. The Project will cover 100% of all villages in each commune and will \naim to achieve 100% water supply and 75% physical sanitation coverage in each commune. In \ncomparison,  the  TSRWSSP  adopted  a  village-level  approach,  which  is  implemented  in  919 \nvillages in 113 communes. It aims to achieve about 70% water supply and 30% sanitation \ncoverage in each village. \n  \n33.  The Project will be designed as a sector investment project, whereby a subproject is a \ncommune.29 It meets the criteria for sector lending as (i) the Government\u2019s 2003 national policy \nremains valid and relevant; (ii) an update of the 2005 sector investment plan is in place; and (iii) \nMRD, the Executing Agency, has sufficient capacity to implement RWSS projects. A financial \nmanagement assessment has been completed for MRD and participating PDRDs. The project \ndesign is based on detailed preparation of two sample subproject communes (Kbal Trach in \nPursat and Bos Sbov in Banteay Meanchey), which are representative of other communes \nregarding type of interventions and impacts.30 Description of physical works for the two sample \nsubprojects is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n34.  A total of 459 communes in six provinces were ranked according to criteria including \npoverty, coverage of household water supply and sanitation, basic access to RWSS, and RWSS \nactivities of development partners in the commune. A list of 65 communes in six provinces was \nthen prepared; however, financing is available only for 40 first-ranked communes (Appendix 2 and \nSupplementary Appendix E). The order in which subprojects will be executed during project \nimplementation will be determined by agreement between the Government and ADB, depending \non (i) their ranking according to the above selection criteria; (ii) readiness of the respective \nprovincial  and  district  line  agencies  and  governments,  commune  councils,  and  villages  to \nimplement the subprojects, and compliance with the agreed eligibility criteria (Appendix 4); (iii) at \nleast 90% of households in each rural village are prepared to participate in subproject activities; \nand (iv) geographical grouping of the subprojects to minimize costs and maximize implementation \nefficiency. Subprojects may be implemented as soon as communes are ready; however, for \nreasons  of  cost,  efficiency,  and  expediency,  it  is  expected  that  they  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented in six batches. \n                                                 \n29 A subproject is defined as a rural commune, which may include an average of 10 villages each and about 9,000 \npersons (ranging from 3,000 to 19,000 persons). The size of each subproject is about $470,000. \n30  The project preparatory technical assistance also prepared a sample subproject for Pal Hal commune in Preah \nVihear, but the province was subsequently removed due to the need to focus the geographical area of the Project. ", "    11 \nB.  Outputs \n35.  The Project has five outputs (i) improved community health and hygiene practices; (ii) \nrehabilitated, upgraded, and developed water facilities; (iii) improved public and household \nsanitation; (iv) strengthened sector planning and development; and (v) improved capacity for \nproject implementation. The sequencing of outputs and activities is in Appendix 5.  \n \n36.  Output  1:  Improved  community  health  and  hygiene  practices  will  be  delivered \nthrough (i) increased community mobilization and action, (ii) preparation of village water supply \nand sanitation plans, (iii) formation and training of WSUGs, (iv) strengthened community groups \nand  individuals  for  effective  delivery  of  health  and  hygiene  messages,  and  (v)  improved \nhousehold  management  of  RWSS.  An  indicative  community  mobilization  plan  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix F \n \n37.  The Project will promote community participation and ownership in technology choice, \nplanning, and implementation of improved village RWSS facilities and in better household water \nmanagement and hygiene education. It will focus on improving a community's understanding of \nthe importance of improved health outcomes brought about by water supply, sanitation, and \nhygiene through the CLTS-hybrid approach. Rural residents will be equipped with the tools \nnecessary to change their own behavior. Individuals considered champions or natural leaders \nby their peers will be identified and trained as lead facilitators for peer-to-peer behavior-change \nefforts in safe water use, improved sanitation, and proper hygiene. The Project will support \nwomen's participation and their role as the main users and managers of water in households. At \nleast 50% of all lead facilitators will be women. \n \n38.  The Project will help WSUGs plan and develop RWSS facilities. Group members will \nreceive training in O&M and repair. At least 40% of all board members, and 50% of those trained \nin O&M, will be women. A user-friendly approach will be used, which takes into account gender \nissues and cultures and languages of ethnic groups. PDRD project teams in each participating \nprovince will partner with an NGO team in implementing this output. Existing hygiene education \nmaterials will be used, and links to the activities of other organizations will be established.  \n \n39.  The Project will integrate elements of CLTS in the overall village engagement process to \nfocus on RWSS and hygiene. Although the TSRWSSP followed a village engagement process, \nit seemed to introduce project support for latrines too quickly without allowing communities to \ndemonstrate their commitment to improved hygiene behavior and sanitation practices. Further, \nthe CLTS approach in Cambodia tends to focus solely on sanitation and misses out on the \nimportance  of  safe  water  use  and  its  complementary  benefits.  The  Project  will  work  with \nWSUGs, villages, communes, schools, and other social groups to communicate information on \nRWSS. Behavior-change efforts will focus on (i) safe water management at the source, during \ntransport, and in the household; and (ii) stopping open defecation, encouraging proper use and \nmaintenance  of  household  latrines,  and  promoting  personal  hygiene  practices  (e.g.,  hand \nwashing and clean bodies). The Project will support latrine construction in stages through the \ncommunity procurement model that was piloted under the TSRWSSP. It builds on the \"learning \nby  seeing\"  effect  and  allows  households  to  build  latrines  in  stages.  The  CLTS\u2013hybrid  for \nachieving health outcomes is detailed in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n40.  Output 2: Rehabilitated, upgraded, and developed water facilities will be delivered \nthrough  (i)  existing  water  supply  points  rehabilitated  or  upgraded  to  improved  water  supply \nfacilities; (ii) new, improved water supply points are developed; and (iii) improved monitoring of \nwater quality for all water facilities. Beneficiary contributions will not be collected from those \n ", "12  \nhouseholds opting to rehabilitate or upgrade existing wells. New construction will be based on the \ncost-sharing principles adopted by the TSRWSSP.31 \n \n41.  The Project will support the (i) rehabilitation and construction of deep drilled wells; (ii) \nupgrading, rehabilitation, and construction of hand-dug wells; (iii) construction of combined \nwells, where a drilled well is constructed inside a hand-dug well to improve access of the well to \naquifers; (iv) rehabilitation (desilting), upgrading, and construction of existing ponds where water \nwill be filtered prior to human consumption (together with household filters); and (v) rainwater \ncollection through two jumbo jars in households and schools. Small community-based piped \nwater supply systems for less than 250 households will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  \n \n42.  New drilled wells will be based on communities' knowledge of sufficient quantity and \nquality of water sources, but actual site selection for deep well construction will be based on \nhydrogeological testing. The costs of groundwater testing will be included in the drilling contract, \nas all contractors have the equipment and ability to drill up to 100 meters. In more difficult areas, \nthe Project will support initial groundwater testing for wells 100\u2013200 meters deep; this will be \nlimited to one site per commune. A least-cost analysis will be part of the subproject feasibility \nreport, which will help determine the most appropriate water supply technology to be supported by \nthe Project and will help reduce the number of negative wells. \n \n43.  Abandoned, existing drilled wells will be considered for rehabilitation by repairing the well \nor replacing the pump (or parts of it). When shallow groundwater of acceptable quality is available, \nnew hand-dug wells with manual suction pumps may be constructed. To qualify as improved \nwater sources, these dug wells must be lined and covered to avoid contamination. Existing dug \nwells may be rehabilitated by lining the well, covering the well, fitting a hand pump, draining the \narea around the well, or a combination of these measures. Rehabilitation and upgrading of \nexisting facilities will be limited to 30% of the cost of a new facility. \n \n44.  The Project will support one 16 parameter water quality test and three annual six parameter \nwater quality tests for all water facilities. It also will support improvements in well-drilling technology \nas a means of improving drilling efficiency, well quality, and the incidence of successful wells. \nDuring the construction of deep drilled wells, the six parameter test will be conducted. If the water \nis found to be unsuitable, the well will not be developed further. Technical options for rural water \nsupply facilities are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n45.  Output  3:  Improved  public  and  household  sanitation will be delivered through (i) \nconstruction of public latrines at schools and health facilities (five per commune), and (ii) provision \nof household latrines. Public latrines will follow the following cost-sharing principles: 80% project, \n10% beneficiary contribution in kind, and 10% government contribution in cash.  \n \n46.  The Project will support the construction and improvement of latrines in public areas to \nhelp strengthen hygiene awareness and behavioral change. Each commune will be able to \nprioritize public latrine facilities (four latrines at each facility) in five locations (schools or health \nfacilities). Public latrines will be constructed in separate areas for men and women to respond to \nthe privacy needs of women (i.e., two-latrine block for men and two-latrine block for women). \nPrior to construction, the PDRD will sign an O&M agreement with the WSUG board (or the \nrelevant school or health committee). The agreement will outline the terms and conditions of the \n                                                 \n31  The Project will provide financing for 90% of the total cost of the water facility, and beneficiaries will contribute the \nremaining 10%, of which 3% will be in cash and 7% in kind. ", "    13 \narrangement,  cost-sharing  principles,  agreement  to  carry  out  hygiene  and  awareness \ncampaigns, and detailed plans for continuous O&M. \n \n47.  The Project will promote informed choice of sanitation facilities based on a range of \noptions. It will provide each household with a sanitation grant of $75 (equivalent to the current cost \nof providing the substructure of an improved dry-pit latrine with a concrete ring-lined pit). The \nProject will support this minimum standard latrine, as it is the most cost-effective, hygienic, \ndurable, and upgradable to a water-sealed or pour-flush latrine at minimum cost. The average \ncost of an improved dry-pit latrine is $115,32 and the Project will cover the cost of materials and \nconstruction of four rings and cement slabs, including supervision fees. Beneficiaries will be \nresponsible for the remaining cost in kind for digging the pit and construction of the superstructure. \nHouseholds  that  prefer  water-sealed  or  pour-flush  latrines  will  be  required  to  contribute  the \ndifference  in  cost  of  the  substructure  in  cash.  Technical  options  for  rural  sanitation  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n48.  Output 4: Strengthened sector planning and development will be delivered through \n(i) improved monitoring and supervision of RWSS facilities by maintaining and upgrading the \nRWSS database that was established by the TSRWSSP in five provinces, and establishing the \ndatabase in the new province, (ii) support to the water and sanitation (WATSAN) sectoral working \ngroup  coordination  meetings,  (iii)  strengthened  private  sector  involvement  in  RWSS \ndevelopment through training in technical and management fields, and (iv) improved RWSS \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) for health outcomes.  \n \n49.  The Project will support small entrepreneurs for local manufacturing of precast concrete \ncomponents,  particularly  pit  and  well  rings,  toilet  slabs,  and  jumbo  jars.  It  will  assist  in \nestablishing a small contractor base at the commune level for the construction of protected dug \nwells and rainwater storage tanks, extending the knowledge of polyvinyl chloride suction-pump \ntechnology, and developing capacity with commune-based mechanics to support WSUGs in \ntheir responsibility for the repair and maintenance of hand pumps. It will also support well-drilling \ncontractors in the form of on-the-job training for improved well-drilling technology to increase \noverall success rates and efficiency. Although registered contractors with MRD (a total of 50) will \nhave priority to participate in this training, PDRD technical staff and new contractors that are \nwilling to register will be encouraged to attend. \n \n50.  The Project will recruit an international NGO to undertake a baseline survey, midterm \nevaluation, and final evaluation to help measure the project outcome and outputs. The NGO will \nbe required to adapt and expand the PPMS for the new project, and provide a training package to \nM&E officers within MRD, PDRDs, and commune councils for effective collection of data. This will \nresult in reduced overall costs of M&E activities, as data for the midterm and final evaluations will \nbe readily available. The NGO will employ a randomized sample survey in the project communes, \nand will include control groups to help determine the impact of RWSS on health outcomes.  \n \n51.  Output 5: Improved capacity for project implementation will be delivered through (i) \nproject  orientation  workshops  at  the  national  and  subnational  levels;  and  (ii)  a  capacity \ndevelopment program for MRD, PDRDs, district offices of rural development, commune councils, \nRWSS committees,33 and WSUGs. National and subnational project orientation workshops will be \n                                                 \n32  Includes the cost of labor for excavating the pit ($15), materials for the four rings ($44), materials for a cement slab \n($12), construction costs ($13), supervision costs ($5), and materials for construction of the building ($26).  \n33 A RWSS committee will be established at the village level, comprising of one representative for rural water supply and \none person for sanitation from each WSUG. It builds on the sanitation committees under the TSRWSSP. \n ", "14  \nconducted to inform key stakeholders about the project design and eligibility of communes to \nparticipate in the Project. Capacity development will focus on improving project implementation \npractices,  including  social  and  gender  awareness  training,  planning  and  budgeting,  and \naccounting and bookkeeping. The Project will involve WSUGs and RWSS committee members to \nhelp strengthen their capacity in water and sanitation service management and delivery. An \ninstitutional capacity assessment is in Supplementary Appendix H and an indicative capacity \ndevelopment plan in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC.  Special Features \n52.  An Integrated Approach to RWSS and Hygiene Awareness. The Project emphasizes \nan integrated approach to rural water supply, sanitation, and hygiene awareness. It applies a \ncommune-based approach to Project implementation. Full benefits of household access to \nimproved water cannot be realized unless the water is managed properly between the source \nand the home and within the home. Sanitation cannot be achieved without access to water for \nhand and body washing and latrine flushing. Hygiene awareness is the activity that effectively \nlinks water and sanitation and maximizes project benefits. \n \n53.  Strong Links with Other ADB Projects. The Project has a synergistic relationship with \nADB operations in Cambodia, especially those under the Tonle Sap Initiative. Building Community \nCapacity for Poverty Reduction Initiatives in the Tonle Sap Basin aims to increase the awareness \nof communities and local governments on community-driven planning and implementation of \nvarious  projects  under  this  Initiative.34 The  Project  is  also  working  in  communes  that  have \nreceived support from the Commune Council Development Projects I and II.35 Existing training \nmodules developed within Cambodia will be reviewed and modified as required and used as a \nbasis for training of trainers for focal persons groups. Management capacity and community \nawareness will be enhanced, as the Project will overlap with several communes under the Tonle \nSap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project (ADB project under preparation).  \n \n54.  Community-Driven Development for RWSS Improvements. Rural infrastructure is one \nof the core community-driven development sectors. The Project supports three hallmarks of the \ncommunity-driven development approach (i) local capacity development; (ii) participatory decision \nmaking (in site selection, technology choices, and O&M of community infrastructure); and (iii) \ncommunity control of resources through an innovative community-managed procurement system \nfor sanitation. Support to community-driven development also includes developing community \ngroup capacity; supporting an enabling environment through policy and institutional reform; and \nstrengthening local governance relationships, such as by strengthening links between community \norganizations and local government. By promoting community participation and ownership and \nengaging  commune  councils,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  institutional  arrangements  for \nplanning, financing, and managing RWSS investments, and will make services more responsive \nand accountable to the poor in the Tonle Sap Basin.  \n \n                                                 \n34  ADB. 2007.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n57.  MRD will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The current project management unit \nfor the TSRWSSP will be expanded, with additional staff and resources, into a PCU within \nDRWS.  The  PCU  will  operate  in  the  same  way  as  the  project  management  unit  for  the \nTSRWSSP. It will be responsible for (i) policy and implementation coordination between MRD \nand  other  national  agencies,  provincial  agencies,  international  development  agencies,  the \nprivate sector, and ADB; (ii) overall project planning and coordination; (iii) setting standards for \ntechnical design, construction, and quality of services; (iv) review and implementation of the \n ", "16  \nPPMS; (v) participation in procurement committees in the provinces for contract packages in \nexcess of $50,000; (vi) supporting the awareness campaign on water use, sanitation, and \nhygiene education; (vii) standardization and collation of project reports; and (viii) advertising, \nand providing information to the private sector on project business opportunities.  \n58.  The project steering committee that was established for the TSRWSSP will continue to be \nchaired by MRD secretary of state and will provide oversight to the Project.36 It will meet every \nthree months and handle specific project-related issues, while the TWG-RWSSH handles broader \nsector  issues  at  the  national  level.  MRD  also  participates  on  the  National  Committee  for \nSubnational Democratic Development, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Interior. MRD will \nensure that its representative who attends the National Committee for Subnational Democratic \nDevelopment meetings will also attend the project steering committee meetings. The Project will \nuse the provincial rural development committees (or their appointed equivalents) to coordinate \nproject activities across line ministries at the provincial level.  \n59.  The PDRD in each of the six project provinces will establish a team of experienced staff \nmembers under the direction of the PDRD director (or PDRD deputy director, as delegated). \nThis team will be known as the PDRD project team. The current project implementation units, \nestablished  in  the  five  TSRWSSP  provinces,  will  be  expanded  with  additional  staff  and \nresources from the PDRDs. While each PDRD project team will have the same roles and \nresponsibilities as the project implementation units, it is expected such an arrangement will help \nstrengthen the PDRD as a whole. Each will be responsible for the daily coordination and \nimplementation of subproject communes in its respective province.   \n60.  The PDRD project teams will be responsible for (i) liaising with commune councils and \nWSUGs; (ii) selecting subproject communes; (iii) preparing provincial project implementation \nplans; (iv) carrying out subproject feasibility studies and preparing subproject feasibility reports \n(including commune gender action plans) that will include technical design, appraisal, bidding \ndocuments  for  works  (if  required),  and  safeguards  reports  including  land  acquisition, \nenvironmental screening, and initial environmental examinations (if necessary); (v) procuring \nworks; (vi) establishing a procurement committee, chaired by the PDRD director with members \ndrawn from PDRD staff; 37 (vii) implementing land acquisition, resettlement, environmental, and \ngender activities; (viii) providing technical advice to communities for selection and rehabilitation, \nimprovement, or development of water supply and sanitation facilities and their subsequent \nO&M;  (ix)  implementing  the  awareness  campaign  on  water  use,  sanitation,  and  hygiene \neducation; (x) collecting M&E data, and entering them into the database; and (xi) preparing \nreports. Each PDRD project team will also submit an annual training plan to the PCU for \nconsolidation and submission to ADB, with an estimated budget, number of participants, and \ntype of trainings within the first quarter of each year. Prior to undertaking subsequent training \nactivities, a short report on the training, number of participants disaggregated by sex, and \noutcomes of the training will be submitted with the new annual training plan. Implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 7, and detailed arrangements in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n                                                 \n36 Includes members from MRD departments (Rural Water Supply, Rural Health Care, Community Development, \nTraining, Planning, and Administration and Staff [responsible for gender]), and six PDRD directors). Representatives \nfrom Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), MOH, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, and the Council for \nAgriculture and Rural Development will be invited, as needed. \n37  Includes the PDRD procurement officer, administration officer, and other PDRD staff members (as needed). The \nproject consultant team leader or other member may attend the meeting as an observer. These practices operate \nwithin MEF's standard operating procedures, which are in line with ADB and World Bank procurement requirements.  ", "    17 \n2.  Implementation Period \n61.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years between 2010 and 2015. An \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 5.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n62.  Procurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  those  described  in  the  agreed \nprocurement plan (Appendix 8). Equipment and material packages valued at $100,000 equivalent \nor more may be procured under national competitive bidding, and those below $100,000 through \nshopping. Works contracts will be awarded under national competitive bidding procedures, due to \nthe small size of contracts. Works contracts for household sanitation with a total value of $5,000 \nequivalent or less can be procured at the commune level and will follow community participation in \nprocurement in accordance with ADB's procedure in implementing small projects with community \nparticipation. A review of the procurement procedures under the TSRWSSP, including the use of \ncommunity participation in procurement, found these to be consistent with the requirements of \nADB. The first works and goods contracts under national competitive bidding will be subject to \nprior review by ADB. All other contracts will be subject to post-review by ADB. PDRD project \nteams will also maintain specified documents,38 and will be responsible for preparing the bidding \ndocuments and contracts, chairing the procurement committees, and awarding contracts for all \nworks. All work contracts with a total value of $50,000 equivalent or more will require the presence \nof a PCU member on the procurement committee and ADB approval.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n63.  Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting  services  will  include  recruitment  of  (i)  a \nconsulting firm, (ii) an international or national NGO comprising of 18 national facilitators (3 \nfacilitators per PDRD), (iii) service contracts for 12 specialists, and (iv) an international NGO for \nM&E. The firm will include consulting services at a total of 338 person-months, of which 56 \nperson-months will be for four international specialists and 282 person-months will be for 14 \nnational specialists, including seven national accountant and financial management specialists at \nthe PCU and PDRDs. Consulting services will help support the PCU and PDRD project teams in \nproject management, feasibility studies, design construction, and supervision of water supply and \nsanitation  infrastructure,  accounting,  preparation  of  social  assessments  with  information  on \npoverty, gender and ethnic groups, financial management, institutional and human resources \ndevelopment, social and community development, health and hygiene, involuntary resettlement \nand  environmental  safeguards,  and  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The \nconsulting team will be engaged through a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (80:20). Shortlisted firms will be required to submit a full technical proposal. NGOs will be \nengaged through quality- and cost-based selection (80:20) or a quality-based selection method. \nThe six RWSS engineers (240 person-months) and six community development facilitators (288 \nperson-months) will be engaged as needed, as individual consultants under time-based contracts.  \n \n64.  In addition to the firm, the PCU will also recruit an international or a national NGO to \nsupply 18 national facilitators (a team comprising of 3 facilitators per each PDRD) to assist with \n                                                 \n38 Including the village water supply and sanitation plan, bid invitation letters, bid opening statements, bid evaluation \nreports or approval documents, and signed contracts between the PDRD project teams and contractors. \n ", "18  \nproject management, technical issues, community development, and training. The NGO will be \nrecruited for a total of 756 person-months. Each PDRD will receive a team of three facilitators\u2014\none for project implementation and two community development facilitators. The team will work \nwith the PDRD project teams and at the commune and village levels as an extension of the \nconsulting firm. The NGO will report to the PDRD director for daily implementation, and to the \nPCU  director  and  the  consultant  team  leader  to  ensure  a  unified  approach  to  project \nimplementation is adopted in the six project provinces. An international NGO also will be recruited \nfor monitoring and evaluation on an output-based lump sum contract. The international NGO will \nbe responsible for undertaking a (i) baseline survey, (ii) midterm survey and evaluation, (iii) final \nsurvey and evaluation, and (iv) developing a training-of-trainers module for improved RWSS \nmonitoring at the PDRD, commune council, and village levels. An outline terms of reference is in \nAppendix 9, and detailed terms of reference is in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \n5.  Advance Recruitment of Consulting Services \n65.  MRD requested advance recruitment of all consulting services, with the exception of the 12 \nindividual consultants. MRD has the capacity to do so, as demonstrated under the TSRWSSP.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n66.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MRD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  are  included  in  the  grant \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n67.  To  encourage  greater  stakeholder  participation,  transparency,  and  accountability,  the \nProject will (i) strengthen the capacity within MRD to comply with the project administration \nmanual;  (ii)  establish  a  project  website  to  disclose  information  about  project-related  issues, \nincluding procurement (e.g., contracts, bidding procedures, contract awards, and list of goods and \nservices procured), and grievance redressal procedures; (iii) establish or use the existing system \non information disclosure at commune council offices (e.g., notice board that displays information \non contracts, list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding \nprocedures, contract awards, and list of goods and services procured); (iv) notify communities of \nthe date and location of selected events in the procurement process (e.g., public bid openings, \nprogress reviews, and handover ceremonies); and (v) establish a grievance redress mechanism \nat the PCU and PDRD project team levels in each project province to receive complaints from \ncommunities or contractors. The PCU or PDRD project team will provide a formal reply within 20 \nworking days, and report all grievances in their progress reports to the Government and ADB.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n68.  Payment of eligible expenditures from the proceeds of the grant will be made either \nthrough  direct  payment  or  imprest  account  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To ensure the timely release of \ngrant proceeds and to expedite project implementation, the Ministry of Economy and Finance \nwill\u2014immediately upon grant effectiveness\u2014open a deposit account at the National Bank of ", "    19 \nCambodia  and  the  PCU  will  open  a  first-generation  imprest  account  at  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable to the Government and ADB. The PDRD project team director will set up a second-\ngeneration imprest account at the provincial level with a commercial bank acceptable to the \nGovernment and ADB for disbursement of eligible funds for small contracts.39 The PCU and \nPDRD project teams may use the statement of expenditure procedure for replenishing the imprest \naccounts, provided that each individual payment does not exceed $50,000.  \n \n69.  The imprest accounts will be used, managed, replenished, and liquidated by the PCU in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The deposit to each imprest account will \nbe based on estimated expenditure to be financed through the imprest account for the next 6 \nmonths of project implementation, to be prepared by the PCU and PDRD project teams, but will \nnot exceed the combined ceiling equivalent of $2.1 million, with a ceiling of $300,000 for each \nsecond-generation  imprest  account.  Withdrawal  applications,  including  imprest  account \nreplenishment requests, will be prepared by the PDRD project teams and sent through the PCU \nto the Ministry of Economy and Finance for approval. Each imprest account will be managed by \nthe PCU or PDRD project team with the validation of the consultant team leader, in accordance \nwith detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. No disbursement of grant \nproceeds will be made to the PCU or a participating PDRD project team if misprocurement has \nbeen found by ADB or if procurement has been identified as irregular, until the misprocurement \nor other irregularity has been corrected by the province concerned to the satisfaction of the \nGovernment and ADB. Each WSUG will provide a contribution of 10% of the total cost for a \nwater supply system, of which 3% will be in cash and 7% in kind. The cash contribution from \nthese groups will be kept at the provincial level, which is managed by the PDRD project team.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n70.  The Project will be administered in accordance with the Government's Financial Manual for \nInvestment  Projects,40 which  describes  the  Government's  financial  management  policies  and \nprocedures  for  efficient  and  effective  implementation  of  ADB  and  World  Bank  projects,  and \nachievement  of  objectives.  A  separate  accounting  system  for  project  expenditures  will  be \nestablished and maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles. The consultant team \nwill provide training on the use of the imprest accounts and operating support to PCU and PDRD \nproject team accounting staff members. All project accounts will be audited annually as part of the \nregular audit by an independent auditing firm acceptable to ADB, using international accounting \nand auditing standards. The consolidated audit reports will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of \nthe close of the Government's fiscal year. The audit opinion will include (i) an assessment of the \nadequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  regarding  project  expenditures  and \ntransactions to ensure safe custody of project-financed assets; (ii) a determination as to whether \nthe Government, MRD, and participating provinces have maintained adequate documentation for \nall financial transactions, specifically including the statement of expenditure and imprest account \nprocedures  for  both  first-  and  second-generation  imprest  accounts;  and  (iii)  confirmation  of \ncompliance with the project financial management system and ADB requirements for project \nmanagement. A separate audit opinion will be issued on the use of the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditure procedures.   \n \n71.  The PDRD project teams will submit quarterly reports and data to the PCU within 15 days \nof the end of each quarter. The PCU will (i) collect and consolidate all project progress reports, \nsite reports, and technical and financial reports and submit them to ADB; and (ii) prepare quarterly \n                                                 \n39  A total of six second-generation imprest accounts will be opened (one per PDRD project team). \n40  MEF. 2005. Financially Managed Manual for Externally Funded Investment Projects in Cambodia. Phnom Penh. \n ", "20  \nprogress reports within 30 days of the end of each quarter, a midterm project evaluation report, \nand an overall project completion report. The quarterly report will include (i) a narrative description \nof progress made during the reporting period; (ii) modifications, if any, to the implementation \nschedule; (iii) details of land use, resettlement, and environmental screening; (iv) information on \npoverty and social development activities, including gender; (v) major project activities by PCU, \nPDRD project teams, and NGOs; (vi) financial and procurement-related information; (vii) problems \nexperienced and remedial actions proposed; (viii) the work to be carried out during the upcoming \nreporting  period;  and  (ix)  a  summary  of  expenditures  during  the  quarter,  year-to-date \nexpenditures, and total expenditures to date.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n72.  The PPMS was developed under the TSRWSSP in 2007, and provides for the collection of \ndata from subprojects with computer entry done at the provincial level. Data is then aggregated at \nthe national level, and information is available for subprojects (villages in the case of TSRWSSP), \ncommunes,  districts,  provinces,  and  the  project.  The  Project,  within  12  months  of  grant \neffectiveness, will make adjustments to the existing PPMS to ensure that it meets its performance \nand safeguard reporting needs. A baseline survey will be conducted, as part of each village water \nsupply and sanitation plan and by the international NGO (output 4). Each PDRD will provide the \nPCU with quarterly reports on its activities, compliance with safeguard requirements, and progress \ntoward output targets. The PCU will consolidate these reports into a quarterly progress report that \nwill be finalized and circulated to ADB, MRD, and the project steering committee within 1 month of \nthe end of the reporting quarter. Baseline data for each commune subproject will be drawn from \nthe information contained in the subproject feasibility report, which will be prepared prior to the \nfinal selection of the commune as a participating subproject. Select data will be disaggregated by \nsex, household income, and ethnic group where applicable.  \n \n73.  During project implementation, the PDRD project teams will be responsible for ensuring \nthat the PPMS is implemented and updated, in consultation with the local communities, to (i) \nexamine the project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities, (iii) \nassess the achievement of the Project\u2019s objectives, (iv) ensure compliance with social safeguards, \nand (v) measure the Project\u2019s benefits. Annual PPMS reports will be prepared by each PDRD \nproject team, then consolidated by the PCU and submitted to ADB. The integrated system for the \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation of project impacts, outcomes, and outputs accords with \nADB\u2019s Project Performance Monitoring System Handbook (2007). \n \n10.  Project Review \n74.  MRD  and  ADB  will  conduct  joint  project  reviews  at  least  twice  a  year  and  a \ncomprehensive project review about 30 months after grant effectiveness. The comprehensive \nproject review will evaluate (i) the actual progress of each project output in each province; (ii) \nimplementation arrangements and procedures within the Government's decentralization and \ndeconcentration  process;  (iii)  role  of  village  development  committees  (VDCs)  in  furthering \nproject implementation (i.e., coordinating village-level activities) following the approval of the \nRoyal Decree and Subdecree; (iv) activity schedules with focus on targets, type of technologies \npromoted,  rehabilitation  of  nonfunctioning  water  facilities,  and  upgrading  of  existing  water \nfacilities; (v) procurement procedures; (vi) progress and effectiveness of capacity development \nprograms;  (vii)  feedback  from  NGO  surveys  and  PPMS  activities;  (viii)  functioning  and \nperformance of the PCU and PDRD project teams; (ix) performance of consultants and NGOs; \n(x) financial performance and cost recovery of WSUGs; and (xi) effectiveness of safeguard \nprocedures.  ", "    21 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts  \n75.  Poverty and Social Impacts. The Project will directly benefit an estimated 377,000 rural \nresidents with access to improved water, of which about 290,000 people will also benefit from \nimproved sanitation facilities in the 40 communes. About 50% of the project beneficiaries are \nexpected to be poor given (i) the higher-than-average rural population share, (ii) rural poverty is \nhigher than urban poverty, (iii) the higher-than-average poverty incidence in project provinces, and \n(iv) the Project's targeting methodology that will reach the poorest communes in the project area. \nAccess to improved RWSS is expected to improve the health status of households (especially \nchildren and the elderly) and reduce medical expenditure, as the water is expected to be potable. \nIt also increases the rate of child survival, which is a precursor to the demographic transition to \nlower fertility rates. The Project is not expected to have any significant adverse impacts, as \npotential adverse impacts identified during project preparation have been eliminated by a change \nin design or mitigated as part of the Project. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 10, and a full poverty and social assessment is in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n76.  Ethnic Minority Impacts. Only a very small proportion of the population (an estimated \n1.4%) belongs to ethnic minority groups that are not native speakers of the Khmer language. As \nwith the TSRWSSP, the Project is classified as category B, as very few ethnic minorities have \nbeen identified in the subproject communes. The Project will ensure these ethnic and religious \nminorities  are  informed,  consulted,  and  mobilized  to  participate  in  subproject  preparation. \nAdditionally, the socioeconomic information collected during the preparation of each subproject \nfeasibility  report  will  include  information  on  ethnic  and  religious  minorities.  The  ensuing \nsubproject feasibility report will ensure that minorities receive equal access to project benefits, \nand their representation adequately reflected in the establishment of WSUGs.  \n77.  Gender Impacts. RWSS programs provide an opportunity to deliver direct benefits to \nwomen  through  time-savings  and  improved  health,  while  improving  the  sustainability  of  the \nservices. Promoting women's participation in WSUGs and as peer-to-peer facilitators will also \ncontribute to women's empowerment through by strengthening their decision-making abilities in \nthe communities. Time-savings from collecting water from distant or low-yielding sources and \nimproved personal and family health will also lead to the increasing economic productivity of \nwomen.  Further,  convenient  access  to  water  and  sanitation  facilities  increases  privacy  and \nreduces the risk of women and girls to sexual harassment or assault. A project gender action plan \nhas been prepared that builds on the implementation experiences of that developed for the \nTSRWSSP. It ensures broad understanding of\u2014and attention to\u2014the different needs of women \nand men in the RWSS sector, and provides equal opportunities for women and men to access \nproject benefits and participate in capacity development activities. Specific targets include (i) at \nleast 50% of the selected commune- and village-level focal persons, including peer leaders, be \nwomen; (ii) at least 40% of each RWSS committee and WSUG board be women; and (iii) village-\nlevel project activities are implemented in cooperation with the commune council committees on \nwomen and children's affairs. The plan is in accordance with the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs \nnational strategy for gender mainstreaming, MRD gender working group action plan, and ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998). A summary gender analysis and action plan is in \nAppendix 11, with details in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n78.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts. The Project is designed to minimize land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. Project interventions will require small parcels of land for the \nconstruction  of  RWSS  facilities  in  rural  areas,  but  the  TSRWSSP  experience  confirms  that \n ", "22  \nsubprojects can be designed without severely affecting people and households. Each subproject \ncommune will require that a village water supply and sanitation plan be prepared. This will include \nassessment of the scope of land acquisition and resettlement for the selected works in that village. \nA  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF),  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Government laws and regulations,  will guide the \npreparation of resettlement action plans (RAPs) for the subproject communes. A commune-level \nRAP will consolidate any land acquisition and resettlement impacts of all RWSS interventions in \nthe commune. Permanent land acquisition for RWSS facilities will be minimal, but the scope can \nonly be determined once the mix of interventions is decided by the communities. The LARF has \nbeen prepared to ensure that there will be no displacement and relocation of houses or structures. \nLand is either voluntarily contributed or compensated at full replacement cost at current market \nvalue. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts for the Project have been classified as category \nB. The summary LARF is in Appendix 12, and the full LARF is in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n79.  Environmental Impacts. The Project is classified as environmental category B (non-\nsensitive).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  for  the  project  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003), and the Government\u2019s environmental requirements. It covers a range of interventions, \nwhich are similar and small in scale, and found that most environmental impacts of the Project \nare positive. Potential negative impacts would arise from (i) detonation of unexploded ordnance, \n(ii) risks associated with inadequate operation and management of treatment facilities, (iii) \nponding and provision of habitats for mosquitoes around water facilities, (iv) bacteriological \npollution of shallow groundwater, (v) presence of arsenic or iron in groundwater,41 and (vi) \nconstruction impacts. These potential negative environmental impacts can be temporary and \ncan  be  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level  with  the  proposed  mitigation  and  water  quality \nmonitoring  measures.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was \nprepared to guide the preparation and approval procedures of environmental assessments of \nthe  subprojects.  The  EARF  describes  institutional  responsibilities  for  environmental \nmanagement, and will include the screening checklists to determine a categorization for each \nintervention. Those interventions with category B will require further analysis. The summary and \nfull IEE, and EARF are in Supplementary Appendix N.  \n80.  Increased Government Capacity and Coordination. MRD and subnational institutions \nin the six project provinces will improve their performance to plan, budget, regulate, and facilitate \nthe development of the RWSS sector. Provinces, districts, communes, and villages will develop \nthe capacity to take new responsibilities. The Project will promote greater transparency regarding \nthe  provision  of  information  and  decision-making  processes  at  all  administrative  levels.  The \ncapacity of government officials working in RWSS and of WSUGs members will be improved in \nsuch  areas  as  project  management  planning  and  administration,  financial  management  and \naccounting,  community  participation  techniques  and  gender  awareness,  data  collection  and \nmanagement,  public\u2013private  partnerships,  environmental  and  resettlement  issues,  and  such \ntechnical aspects as monitoring water quality and supervising drilling operations.  \n81.  Economic Impact. Two sample subproject communes were selected for feasibility. The \neconomic internal rate of return for Kbal Trach in Pursat is 19.7% and 18.2% for Bos Sbov in \nBanteay Meanchey. The economic internal rate of return takes into account the capital investment \nfor  water  supply  and  the  sanitation  facilities,  including  the  cost  of  the  consultants  (project \nmanagement and capacity building) and incremental administration cost. The subprojects are \n                                                 \n41  In the TSRWSSP, out of 2,235 drilled wells, only one case of arsenic was found out in Pursat at levels more than \n0.005 milligrams per liter (mg/l), 446 cases of iron at levels more than 4 mg/l, and a few cases where levels were more \nthan 0.3mg/l. Iron reduction plants have successfully reduced iron levels from 10 mg/l to 0.3 mg/l and 0.16 mg/l.  ", "    23 \nassessed as being economically viable. During project preparation, several options for water \nsupply and sanitation had been evaluated. Two alternatives for water supply were identified for \neach commune, and each option was further refined and developed using the results of the \nsocioeconomic  surveys.  For  each  sample  subproject  commune,  a  least-cost  analysis  was \ncompleted, and the benefit-cost analysis is based on the least-cost alternative. A least-cost \nanalysis for the sanitation output was not done, since each subproject will support development of \nan improved pit latrine, which households can upgrade based on individual  preference and \naffordability levels. An economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 13.  \nB.  Risks \n82.  Institutional  and  Governance  Risks.  Potential  risks  include  (i)  changes  to  the \ndecentralization and deconcentration processes following the approval of the Organic Law in \n2008,  (ii)  challenges  at  the  national  and  subnational  level  in  moving  away  from  project \nimplementation  units  to  project  teams  in  the  PDRDs,  and  (iii)  ensuring  proper  financial \nmanagement controls at the provincial level. To mitigate these risks, actions are included in the \nProject to (i) inform key stakeholders at the national and subnational levels about the Project \nand its alignment with the decentralization and deconcentration processes to date; (ii) coordinate \nclosely with other ADB-supported projects that aim to strengthen subnational-level capacity; (iii) \ncoordinate regularly with the Ministry of Interior about the decentralization and deconcentration \nprocess;  (iv)  ensure  that  existing  implementation  and  fund-flow  arrangements  remain \nunchanged  from  the  time  of  project  processing;  (v)  allow  for  a  review  of  the  existing \nimplementation arrangements within 30 months of grant effectiveness (i.e., project midterm \nreview); (vi) recruit NGO staff members to work with the PDRD project team rather than contract \nout activities; and (vii) recruit local accountants and financial management specialists to support \nthe PDRD project teams during project implementation, and to link to the ongoing activities \nunder the public financial management for rural development (which includes MRD). An agreed \ngood governance framework is in Supplementary Appendix O.  \n83.  Technical Risks. For particular villages, especially those where surface and shallow \ngroundwater is of poor quality due to high content of arsenic, iron, or other pollutants, or where \nthe water table is low, finding an appropriate and affordable technical solution may be difficult. \nTo mitigate this risk, mechanisms have been incorporated in the project design to include (i) \nrequirement of an initial environmental screening in each village before the communities can \nfinalize a village water supply and sanitation plan; (ii) groundwater testing completed as part of \nthe contractor's bid (up to 100 meters); (iii) provisional budget for groundwater testing in difficult \nareas (between 100 and 200 meters); (iv) inclusion of a range of water-supply technologies \n(e.g., protected ponds with filtration) in the project design to allow for alternative options to \ngroundwater source; and (v) at least two persons (50% women) from each WSUG to be trained \nin O&M of water supply facilities.  \n84.  Sector Risks. Since there are several initiatives planned to help support a sector-wide \napproach in RWSS, there is risk of inconsistency and duplication between various institutions. A \nnational rural water supply, sanitation, and hygiene strategy for 2010\u20132025 and implementation \nguidelines will be prepared after the Project is approved. ADB is one of three development \npartners jointly supporting the strategy and implementation guidelines development. To mitigate \nthis risk and ensure that the proposed sector strategy and Project are consistent with one another, \nthe Project will support continued dialogue and coordination with development partners during \nproject implementation  through  the TWG-RWSSH.  An  assurance has been included  for the \napproval of the strategy within 30 months of grant effectiveness, which coincides with the planned \nmidterm review of the Project.  \n ", "24  \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n85.  In addition to the standard assurances on counterpart financing, audit, governance and \nanticorruption, labor standards, and health risks, the Government and MRD have given the \nfollowing project-specific assurances, which are incorporated in legal documents: \n(i)  The MRD and PDRDs will ensure that (a) the contribution of WSUGs, to the \nProject  cost,  at  least  covers  the  cost  of  O&M  of  the  water  facilities;  and  (b) \ntechnical support is provided to the village communities in the Project areas to \nensure continued O&M of the water facilities beyond project period. \n(ii)  The MRD and PDRD will ensure that prior to the construction of public latrines in \neach village, PDRD signs an agreement with the WSUG, for each public facility \noutlining  (a)  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  arrangement,  (b)  cost  sharing \nprinciples, (c) WSUG's responsibility to carry out hygiene awareness campaigns in \nthe village communities, and (d) detailed plan for continued O&M of the sanitation \nfacilities beyond Project period. \n(iii)  The MRD will ensure that its 3-year budget strategy plan for submission to the \nGovernment for annual budget allocations is (a) based on provincial assessments, \n(b) lists rural water and sanitation sector as a priority sector, and (c) prioritizes \nrehabilitation and upgrading of existing water facilities. \n(iv)  The Government will approve, within 12 months of grant effectiveness, a Royal \nDecree and Subdecree on the establishment of VDCs. \n(v)  The MRD has approved the rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene strategy for \n2010-2025 within 30 months of grant effectiveness, and implementation guideline \nwithin 36 months of grant effectiveness. \n(vi)  Within 24 months of grant effectiveness, MRD shall have revised and approved the \nguidelines  on  the  establishment  of  WSUGs  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the \norganization and registration, legal statutes, rights and responsibilities of a WSUG \nand its members, and the election and composition of WSUGs board, to the \nsatisfaction of ADB. The roles and responsibilities of the RWSS committee, its \nmembership, key functions and its relation to VDCs, shall also be included in the \nrevised WSUG guideline. \n(vii)  The Government and MRD will ensure that the implementation arrangements and \nfunds flow mechanisms, agreed between the Government and ADB remains the \nsame throughout the Project implementation period and are not affected by the \nGovernment's decentralization and deconcentration processes. \n(viii)  The Government and MRD will ensure the implementation of the gender action \nplan agreed by the Government and ADB including, but not limited to, ensuring \nthat (a) at least 40% of each WSUG board and RWSS committee is female, and \n(b) 50% of WSUG board members trained in water supply O&M are women. The \nGovernment shall and shall cause MRD to ensure that community mobilization \ncontracts with NGOs require that (a) at least 1 of each 3-person NGO team is \nfemale; (b) the training carried out by NGOs and the PDRD Project Teams, is \ndirected towards the poor and vulnerable, including at least 40% of women; and (c) \nat least 40% of all hygiene and sanitation education participants are male. \n(ix)  The Government and MRD will ensure that its laws and regulations governing \nenvironmental impact assessments, as well as ADB's Environment Policy (2002), \nare followed. If there are any discrepancies between the Government laws and \nregulations and ADB's Environment Policy, the latter shall apply. Each PDRD \nProject  Team  will  conduct  an  environmental  assessment  for  each  subproject ", "    25 \nbased on the EARF. The Government shall and shall cause MRD to further ensure \nthat environmental assessment (a) is based on the procedures set forth in the \nEARF,  (b)  conforms  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  requirements,  (c)  include \ndetails of local consultation carried out, and (d) is submitted to ADB for approval \nprior  to  civil  works  contracts  being  awarded  for  the  subproject  if  any  critical \nenvironmental issues are recognized. The Government must provide certification \nthat unexploded ordnance has been cleared before commencement of civil works. \n(x)  The Government and MRD will ensure that all Project RAPs are approved by ADB \nprior to the award of civil works contracts for clusters of subprojects, in accordance \nwith the Project LARF agreed upon by the Government and ADB, Government\u2019s laws, \nregulations, and procedures, and ADB\u2019s requirements as defined in ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995).

The basis of Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment in Cambodia\u2019s rural water supply \nand sanitation (RWSS) sector is the 2003 national policy for water supply and sanitation1 and the \nupdated  RWSS  sector  investment  plan  (2010\u20132025). 2  RWSS  is  an  integral  part  of  the \nGovernment of Cambodia\u2019s overall strategy for rural development and poverty reduction. The \nGovernment has committed to providing the population with clean and safe water, protecting them \nfrom  water-related  diseases,  and  providing  adequate  water  supply  to  ensure  food  security \neconomic activities and appropriate living standards. The Government also considers improved \naccess to water supply facilities in rural areas to be a key prerequisite for poverty reduction. The \nnational strategic development plan3 reinforces Cambodia Millennium Development Goal (CMDG) \ntarget 7.10, increasing the proportion of rural population with access to safe water from 24% to \n50% by 2015, and target 7.12, increasing the proportion of rural population with access to \nimproved sanitation from 8.6% to 30.0% by 2015. \nA.  The Government Policy, Strategy, and Reform Initiatives \n2.  National Policy on Water Supply and Sanitation. The national policy on water and \nsanitation, ratified by the Council of Ministers on 7 February 2003, is comprised of three parts (i) \nurban water supply policy, (ii) urban sanitation policy, and (iii) RWSS policy. It (i) sets the role of \nGovernment as sector facilitator, enabling other organizations to deliver the actual services; (ii) \nprioritizes services for the poor; (iii) defines the role of the private sector in service delivery and \nthe role of the Government to enable the private sector to achieve this, including promoting \ntransparency  and  competition  in  sector  service  provision;  and  (iv)  establishes  the  role  of \ncommunities  in  management  of  their  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  and  services. \nCommunities are to choose the type and level of service, based on information about the technical \nand financial aspects of the service options. \n3.  The policy framework had several shortcomings, which have since been clarified: \n(i)  Terms\u2014such  as  \u201csafe\u201d,  \u201cimproved\u201d,  \u201caccess\u201d,  \u201csustained\u201d,  \u201csanitation\u201d,  and \n\u201chygienic  environment\u201d\u2014were  unclear,  impeding  effective  monitoring  and \ncomparisons  between  geographic  areas.  The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development \n(MRD) and Ministry of Planning have since clarified the definitions, based on the \nWorld Health Organization and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Joint \nMonitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. \n(ii)  The minimum level of service for water supply and sanitation was undefined, \nmaking it difficult to assess coverage and to make effective comparisons. MRD \nhas clarified that the minimum level of service is 20 liters per capita per day. \n(iii)  Responsibilities between the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) and \nMRD regarding urban and rural water supply systems were unclear. This was \nresolved in 2005 by a memorandum of understanding between MIME and MRD, \nwhich still remains valid. \n4.  In addition, an RWSS sector investment plan for 2005\u20132015 was prepared by MRD in \nJanuary 2005, describing overall sector financing requirements and expected levels of coverage \nbased on CMDGs. MRD updated and approved the sector investment plan for 2010-2025 on 24 \nJune 2009 (footnote 2). It provides funding projection needs to meet the Government\u2019s 2015 \n                                                 \n1  Coordinating Committee for Development of Water Supply and Sanitation Sector. 2003.

In 2007, the estimated rural population with access to safe, improved water was 55.4% \n(5.97  million),  while  19.6%  (2.11  million)  had  access  to  improved  sanitation.  To  attain  the \nnationwide 2015 CMDG targets, an additional 0.012 million rural people should be provided with \nimproved drinking water, and about 1.48 million rural people with improved sanitation. At a cost \nper capita of $16 and $31 for water supply and sanitation, respectively, these additional coverage \nnumbers translate to an estimated $53.5 million in investments from 2008 to 2015. The total \ninvestment includes the cost of the physical infrastructure ($37.1 million), institutional capacity \nimprovement ($9.7 million), and incremental administration ($6.7 million). Of the total $53.5 million \nof  capital  investment  required,  an  estimated  $50.0  million  in  capital  investment  has  been \ncommitted or is planned in the sector from 2008 to 2015.4 The funding gap for investments \nnecessary to meet the 2015 CMDG targets for RWSS is estimated at $3.5 million in capital \ninvestment (excluding recurrent costs). \n \n6.  MRD has projected estimated coverage rates for RWSS by 2020, which are necessary \nto remain on track to meet the stated 2025 targets. These estimates are 75% for rural water \nsupply and 50% for rural sanitation. The capital investment estimate is based on the assumption \nthat the 2015 target coverage is attained. The projected rural populations in 2020 and 2025 are \n12.58 million and 13.42 million, respectively. Using an average cost per capita of $16 and $25 \nfor water supply and sanitation services, respectively, this translates to a capital investment of \n$245.79 million for 2016\u20132020 and $281.72 million for 2021\u20132025. Total capital investment to \nattain the 100% RWSS coverage by 2025 is about $527.51 million. \n \n7.  Sector Definitions and Service Levels. The CMDGs originally presented its targets in \nterms of access to safe water, but changed this term in 2003 to access to improved water. \nNational surveys and RWSS databases in Cambodia do not identify safe sources in terms of \nwater quality; instead, they distinguish between improved and unimproved supplies or facilities. \nMRD proposes 20 liters per capita per day as the minimum quantity to be supplied by an \nimproved source.5 The global definition of less than a 1-kilometer walking distance to an improved \nsource is not accepted in Cambodia, as it is said that people will not walk that far to collect water. \nTherefore, distance to source has not been officially accepted in Cambodia as part of the access \ndefinition. MRD set the maximum walking distance to a water facility at 150 meters, based on \nobservations that people continue to use traditional sources if distances to improved sources are \ngreater than this.  \n \n                                                 \n4 Includes (i) $25.8 million from the Project, (ii) $6 million from the ongoing ADB-supported Tonle Sap Rural Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project, and (iii) $18 million from the Government's RWSS Project.  \n5 MRD. 2001.

In 2007, the Technical Working Group on Rural Water Supply, \nSanitation, and Hygiene was established to coordinate and harmonize policy in Cambodia\u2019s water \nresources, water supply, and sanitation sector. It is comprised of ADB, MIME, Ministry of Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM),  MRD,  UNICEF,  World  Bank\u2019s  Water  Sanitation \nProgram, and other partners. ADB, UNICEF, and the Water Sanitation Program are supporting \nMRD to prepare a national rural water supply, sanitation, and hygiene strategy (2010\u20132025), \nwhich  is  due  for  approval  in  December  2009.  National  technical  guidelines  will  follow  its \npreparation, with inputs from the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n(TSRWSSP)6 technical  guidelines in seven sector themes. In addition, the Water  Sanitation \nProgram is supporting MRD and MIME to prepare a detailed sector investment strategy for urban \nand RWSS, including hygiene and hygiene education due for completion in 2009. The water and \nsanitation sectoral working group, chaired by the Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS) \ndirector, meets monthly to discuss technical issues, and the Water Use and Health Education \nForum is a yearly national event organized by the Department of Rural Health Care (DRHC). \n \n9.  Decentralization and Deconcentration. In 2008, the Organic Law7 was passed, giving \nlegal responsibility to provinces, districts, and commune councils to administer their affairs, \nincluding development plans. This strengthens their role in the oversight and evaluation of \nprojects,  especially  the  functions  of  three  commune-level  committees8 in  project  planning, \nmanagement, and implementation. Every year, commune councils plan and formulate their \nneeds and (i) submit them to development partners through the annual district integration \nworkshop in November, or (ii) implement them with commune funds through the national Seila \nProgram. Discussions with subnational officials have revealed that although RWSS may be \nprioritized  in  commune  plans,  the  sector  may  not  necessarily  be  prioritized  in  district  or \nprovincial plans. All commune councils maintain a database of RWSS facilities in the villages. \n \n10.  ADB Strategy for the Sector. The water supply and sanitation sector road map is an \nappendix to ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Cambodia (2005),9 describes the ADB \ncommitment and targets for the sector, including (i) effective risk management through a proposed \npublic financial management program involving MRD; (ii) operational commitments in RWSS \nsector infrastructure; (iii) assistance to develop a rural water supply, sanitation, and hygiene \nstrategy; and (iv) community mobilization for improved RWSS monitoring and stronger links \namong  water,  sanitation,  and  health.  ADB  targets  support  the  Government's  policy  and \ncommitments in the sector.  \nB.  Sector Responsibilities of Government Agencies: National Level \n \n11.  Among  the  various  government  ministries  and  agencies  with  water  sector-related \nresponsibilities,  those  concerned  with  RWSS  are  MIME,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD.  MIME  is \nresponsible  for  water  supply  to  provincial,  small  towns  and  the  regulation  of  private  sector \ninvolvement in piped water systems; MOWRAM has overall responsibility for water resources \nplanning  and  management;  and  MRD  is  specifically  responsible  for  RWSS.  Although  each \nministry has a mandate, responsibilities that overlap are clarified through ad hoc agreements.  \n \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2005.

Cambodia: Country Strategy and Program 2005\u20132009. Manila. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n12.  Interministerial coordination is limited. Exchange of data or information is slow. Datasets \nin the RWSS sector are inadequate and incompatible because of short periods of observation, \ninsufficient monitoring sites, lost records, or variable baseline information. The quality of the \ndata is often questionable, due to the lack of clear definitions and service indicators. This \nweakness has been recognized by the Government, and steps are being taken to reestablish a \nnational  capacity  to  acquire  and  manage  data  and  information  related  to  RWSS  and  the \nenvironment. MOWRAM and MRD have shared a groundwater database since 1994, and MRD \nhas kept a record of wells installed, with the support of development partners.  \n \n13.  MRD, as with other government agencies, has traditionally been an \u201cimplementer\u201d, with \noperational drilling teams and equipment. Following the 2003 policy framework (footnote 1), \nMRD has taken on policy, planning, and regulatory functions, while construction, supervision, \nand  service  provision  is  gradually  being  done  by  private  enterprises.  Further,  RWSS \nresponsibilities are coordinated between two departments within MRD\u2014the DRWS, which is \nresponsible for rural water supply, and the DRHC, which is responsible for sanitation, health, \nand  hygiene  awareness.  Continued  coordination  is  required  between  the  departments  to \nimplement an integrated RWSS approach.  \nC.  Sector Responsibilities of Government Agencies: Subnational Level \n \n14.  Provincial Department of Rural Development. RWSS responsibilities are planned, \nimplemented, and monitored by provincial departments of rural development (PDRDs) with \ncommune councils and village development councils (if established). PDRDs are comprised of \nsix sections: rural water supply, rural health care, rural credit, rural roads, rural community \ndevelopment, and administration and finance. On average, PDRDs have 40\u201380 staff members, \nmany of which are assigned to projects or work for nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n \n15.  Provincial rural development committees are chaired by the provincial governor and \ncomprise  the  directors  of  seven  provincial  line  agencies:  health,  women\u2019s  affairs,  rural \ndevelopment,  agriculture,  water  resources,  planning,  and  interior.  These  committees  are \nresponsible  for  coordinating  development  initiatives  through  the  formulation  of  provincial \nstrategic  development  plans  and  provincial  investment  plans.  All  relevant  investments  are \nreferred to them for compliance with provincial plans. PDRD directors are the vice chairs of \nthese committees, and executive committees are responsible for their operational activities.  \n \n16.  District Office of Rural Development. The district office of rural development, a line \nagency of MRD, performs PDRD functions at the district level. In some cases, this office exists \nin name only. The district officer is located in the PDRD office and performs district-based duties \nfrom that location. However, projects often deal directly with commune councils under the \nprocedures set out in the Organic Law. The role of the district offices can be strengthened to \nhelp coordinate the rural development activities at the local levels. \n \n17.  Commune  Councils.  Commune  councils  have  had  their  roles  and  responsibilities \nsignificantly strengthened by the process of election of members, which was introduced in 2002, \nand  the  2008  Organic  Law.  Commune  councils  are  responsible  for  the  planning, \nimplementation, and financing of rural infrastructure. They prepare, prioritize, and formulate their \nneeds and prepare annual plans for submission to provincial rural development committees (or \nits equivalent) and development partners. \n \n18.  Villages. The village institutional framework remains generally weak. A village chief, \nappointed  by  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  is  nominally  in  charge  of  village  affairs.  Village \n ", "Appendix 2  35\ndevelopment  committees  (VDCs),  established  under  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme's Seila Program and Cambodia Area Rehabilitation and Regeneration Project, are \nresponsible for a range of rural development affairs. Although a subdecree has been issued \nsupporting the establishment and operation of VDCs, a Royal Decree is in the process of being \ndrafted to make the roles of the VDCs clear and effective within the current decentralization and \ndeconcentration framework. VDC members are elected by eligible voters within the village. The \nvillage chief is not automatically a member, but may stand for office at the time of elections and \ncan attend VDC meetings as a nonvoting advisor. The chairperson of the VDC is elected by \nmembers and reports to the commune council, through the village chief.  \n \n19.  In the absence of the VDC, ad hoc committees are formed to manage village affairs. \nVillage sanitation committees are an example, which have been used under the TSRWSSP to \nimplement  community  procurement  for  latrine  construction.  These  committees\u2014now  RWSS \ncommittees\u2014will function as proposed VDC subcommittees, once VDCs are established by the \nnew Royal Decree and Subdecree. In the commune planning process, the identification and \nplanning of projects is now the responsibility of planning and budgeting committees, which include \ncommune council members and two village representatives\u2014one male and one female. \n \n20.  Water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs) are responsible for managing, operating, and \nmaintaining communal RWSS facilities following MRD guidelines. Their responsibilities include the \ncollection  of  contributions  from  users  and  management  of  operation  and  maintenance \narrangements. Ownership of facilities, agreements with the private sector, and legal aspects \nregarding user service remains a commune responsibility. WSUGs are organized around each \ncommunal water facility, but the merits of a village-level management committee, such as the \nRWSS committee, are being discussed. \nD.  Private Sector Participation \n \n21.  The private sector plays an important role in RWSS development, but it remains weak and \nneeds support in Cambodia. The 2003 RWSS sector policy recognizes the need for MRD to \n\u201ccreate a competitive environment that motivates the private sector to supply cost-effective RWSS \nservices that respond to community demand, especially in underserved areas.\u201d The private sector \nincludes  locally-based  artisans,  mechanics,  markets  and  stores,  manufacturers,  drilling \ncompanies, and consultants (i.e., individuals, NGOs, and firms). Private-sector services can be \nengaged  for  the  provision  of  supply  of  materials  and  equipment;  construction  of  RWSS \ninfrastructure; technical advice; facility management; maintenance and repair; and training for \nmanagement, maintenance, or hygiene issues.  \n \n22.  NGOs and entrepreneurs are becoming more actively involved in the provision of RWSS \nservices, but their capacity in this area remains limited. The business environment essential for \ntheir successful large-scale involvement in RWSS is hampered by a lack of (i) business services, \n(ii) clarity of private-sector regulation, (iii) financial services, (iv) technical specifications, and (v) \nexpected service levels. Despite these constraints, the private sector is evolving. There are many \nprivate suppliers of jars, pipes, hand pumps, latrine slabs, and concrete rings for lining wells or \npits. Contractors have drilling rigs and small entrepreneurs have water carts.  \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.2: Shortlist of Sixty-Five Communes in Six Provinces\nPercent of  Percent of HHs with  Percent of HHs with \nNo. of  Ethnic  Poverty  Access to Improved  Access to Improved  Total  40 Priority \nDistrict Commune HHsa Minoritiesb Scorec Water in Dry Seasond Water in Dry Seasone Scoref Ranking Communes\nA.Banteay Meanchey Province (15 short-listed, 10 prioritized communes)\n1.Malai Ta Kong 3 1 2 3 3 12 1\n2.Ou Chrov Ou Bei Choan 3 1 2 3 3 12 1\n3.Phnum Srok Nam Tau 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n4.Phnum Srok Phnum Dei 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n5.Preah Netr Preah Phnum Lieb 3 1 2 3 3 12 1\n6.Serei Saophoan Bos Sbov 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n7.Svay Chek Phkoam 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n8.Svay Chek Sla Kram 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n9.Svay Chek Svay Chek 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n10.Svay Chek Ta Phou 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n11.Thma Puok Banteay Chhmar 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n12.Thma Puok Kouk Kakthen 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n13.Thma Puok Kouk Romiet 3 1 2 3 3 12 1 \u221a\n14.Mongkol Borei Banteay Neang 3 1 2 3 2 11 2\n15.Mongkol Borei Kouk Ballangk 2 1 2 3 3 11 2\nB.Battambang Province (13 short-listed, 7 prioritized communes)\n1.Samlout Ta Taok 1 3 2 3 3 12 3\n2.Kroas Krala Thipakdei 3 1 2 3 3 12 3\n3.Banan Snoeng 3 1 2 3 2 11 4 \u221a\n4.Banan Ta Kream 3 1 2 3 2 11 4 \u221a\n5.Aek Phnum Prey Chas 2 1 2 3 3 11 4\n6.Rotonak Mondol Andaeuk Haeb 2 1 2 3 3 11 4\n7.Rotonak Mondol Traeng 3 1 2 2 3 11 4\n8.Banan Kantueu Muoy 2 1 2 3 2 10 5 \u221a\n9.Banan Kantueu Pir 2 1 2 3 2 10 5 \u221a\n10.Banan Bay Dam Ram 2 1 2 3 2 10 5 \u221a\n11.Banan Chaeng Mean Chey 2 1 2 2 3 10 5 \u221a\n12.Banan Phnum Sampov 3 1 2 3 1 10 5 \u221a\n13.Bavel Amphil Pram Daeum 3 1 2 2 2 10 5\nC.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector plays an integral part in the Government of Cambodia\u2019s overall strategy for \nrural development and poverty reduction. The national strategic development plan for 2006\u20132010 and the Rectangular Strategya \nprovide the overarching national development framework. The second phase of the Rectangular Strategy was launched in \nSeptember 2008, and a midterm review of the national development plan was conducted in 2008. These key policy documents, \nalong with Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs),b place a high priority on RWSS, recognizing that limited access \nto improved water and sanitation results in poor health, lost productive time due to sickness or caring for sick family members, \nmissed schooling opportunities for children, and increased medical expenditure. Women (especially female heads of household) \nand children, who bear the primary responsibility for collecting water, are the most affected. \n \nThe overarching goal of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Cambodia, as defined in its country strategy and program \n(2005\u20132009), is sustainable poverty reduction.c To achieve this, the country strategy and program results framework (2006\u2013\n2010) rests on three strategic pillars (i) sustainable pro-poor economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) good \ngovernance and improved public service delivery. The results framework identifies improved health and quality of life for the \nrural population as a strategic goal of inclusive social development. Key constraints to achieving this goal are the lack of \ninvestment in and maintenance of drinking water and sanitation facilities; and insufficient community awareness of the links \namong improved water, sanitation, and health, resulting in poor hygiene practices. The RWSS sector is identified as one in \nwhich ADB will play a catalytic role. ADB served as the first lead facilitator of the joint Government\u2013development partner \nTechnical Working Group for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene from July 2007 to June 2009. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                             Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI\u2013M)  \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is embedded in the national strategic development plan, and the 2008 midterm \nreview reiterates that the Government \"attaches high priority to boosting the rural and agricultural sectors in pursuance of its pro-\npoor focus\" and that \"with poverty reduction as the major goal, special focus will be on increasing opportunities and benefits in \nthe rural areas where poverty incidence is high.\" Better rural infrastructure\u2014including increased access to improved water supply \nand sanitation facilities\u2014is an issue to be addressed urgently, and the Project directly responds to this need. Data from the \nMinistry of Planning show that in 2007, only 55.4% of the rural population had access to improved water,d and only 19.6% had \naccess to improved sanitation facilities. This implies that about 80% of the rural population currently practices open defecation.  \n \nThe benefits of the Project to the rural poor will include (i) access to appropriate and improved RWSS facilities; (ii) skills \ndevelopment in the operation and management of these facilities; and (iii) greater awareness of the link among sanitation, \nhygiene, and health. The primary beneficiaries are the rural poor in six provinces\u2014Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap\u2014where improved RWSS facilities will become more accessible \nto the poor and socially excluded. The many benefits of access to improved water and sanitation will include a reduction of the \nincidence of water and sanitation-related illness, improved health, and more time for productive activities. Problems of poverty \nare inextricably linked with those of water\u2014its availability, proximity, quantity, and quality. Improving the access of the poor to \nwater has the potential to make a major contribution toward poverty eradication in Cambodia. Furthermore, achieving water \nand sanitation targets is at the core of achieving all CMDGs, given the many interlinks.  \n \n2.  Design Features \nTo ensure that benefits of improved RWSS reach the poorest, the Project will be implemented in 40 communes. The commune \nselection process applied an index to rank 459 communes in six project provinces. The index was devised to consider poverty, \nincidence of illness, household water supply and sanitation coverage, and other factors. A long list of 65 highest-ranked \ncommunes in six provinces was developed where the needs are greatest. The short list of 40 communes considers the presence \nof other development partner-funded RWSS interventions (to avoid overlap) and the need for geographical focus (to ensure \nefficiency and to reduce transaction costs). The Project will work in a manageable 16 districts in six provinces. Other poverty \nreduction design features include (i) its highly participatory nature (see consultation and participation plan); (ii) minimizing the \nrequirement for household cash contributions to avoid additional cash burdens; and (iii) providing opportunities for private sector \nparticipation in RWSS, which will generate local jobs in construction, operation, and maintenance.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Findings of Social Analysis \nEmpirical evidence from the social analysis demonstrates clear links between poverty and inadequate RWSS. In rural Cambodia, \nthe lack of improved water and sanitary latrines heightens exposure to disease, with women and children the most vulnerable.  \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \nResulting illnesses can reduce life expectancy and add financial burden to already very limited household resources. Results of a \nhousehold survey undertaken in the six project provinces support this finding. Access to improved water and latrines in the \nsurveyed communes is very limited, as only 12% reported access to sanitation. The incidence of waterborne diseases within the \nlast 2 weeks of the survey was reported to be high. Households reported allocating a significant proportion (6%\u201311%) of their \nannual average household income to medical expenditure for water-related illnesses. \n \nA vast majority of households in the six project provinces reside in rural areas and are predominantly dependent on agriculture. \nThe average distance of villages to the nearest health facility ranges from 4 to 14 kilometers and from 8 to 42 kilometers to the \nnearest market. The provincial poverty headcount index in 2004 ranged from 33.7% in Battambang to 52.4% in Kampong Thom.e \nOnly Battambang had a provincial poverty rate lower than the national average of 35.1%. The proportion of rural households with \naccess to improved water supply is low, ranging from 17.2% to 33.2%.  Access to sanitation ranges from a very low 3.5% to \n30.0%.f In 2005, the infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) for the six provinces ranged from 67 in Siem Reap to 97 in \nBattambang (national average: 66) while the under-5 child mortality rate for children ranged from 94 in Siem Reap to 116 in \nBattambang (national average: 83).    \n \nA demographic profile of sample households reveals that 22% are female-headed, the average household has 5.3 members, \nand 98.4% are Khmer (1.4% are members of the Cham minority). Buddhism is the religion of 98%. Household heads generally \nhad attained elementary education (62.5%), though 5.6% had some secondary schooling. Nearly one third of households \nsurveyed (31.3%) had no schooling. In general, female heads of household have very much lower levels of than their male \ncounterparts\u2014only 11.5% had some elementary and 1.0% some secondary education. Illiteracy is common.  \n \nThe favored sources of water during the dry season include ring wells (41.9%) and community ponds or lakes (19.6%) for \ndrinking and cooking, and ring wells (85.7%) and community ponds or lakes (21.8%) for washing and bathing. During the \nrainy season, rainwater is preferred by 48.4% and ring wells by 38.1% for drinking and cooking. For washing and bathing \nduring the rainy season, 44% prefer lined dug wells and 18.5% prefer community ponds or lakes. On average, households \nhave two storage jars with a capacity of 200 liters. During the dry season, nearly one in five respondents reported having to \npurchase water. Only about 6.3% of households reported using a filter for household water treatment. The female members of \nhouseholds are usually responsible for water collection daily. Cleanliness of water containers and sources is normally the \nresponsibility of women and girls, while men look after rainwater harvesting units. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Summary of the Consultation and Participation Process during Project Preparation \nThe consultation and participation process involved a detailed stakeholder analysis and subsequent consultation with \nidentified groups ranging from national-level government officials, development partners, and nongovernment organizations, \nto provincial-, commune-, and village-level officials and beneficiaries. A series of focus group discussions was undertaken as \npart of the poverty and social analysis in two communes to identify concerns of various groups (e.g., local authorities and  \nwomen's groups). The proposed village level participatory process was field tested under the two subproject feasibility studies \n(where a subproject is all interventions in one commune). A multidisciplinary team conducted a participatory and interactive \nrural water supply, sanitation, and hygiene assessment in all villages of the commune, including planning with community \nmembers and village officials. Village water supply and sanitation plans were formulated on the basis of the actual village \nsituation, needs, and preferences of participating households. \n \n2.  What Level of Consultation and Participation Is Envisaged during Project Implementation and Monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a Consultation and Participation Plan Prepared?   Yes      No  \nA Project community mobilization and capacity building plan was prepared to incorporate the functions of community mobilization \nand participation, information dissemination, information and training on household water use, personal and domestic hygiene, \nwater point and latrine maintenance, village participatory planning, and community group strengthening. It includes institutional \nstrengthening for project management, water facility management, and sustainability of public sanitation facilities. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nAs in most cultures, women and girls in Cambodia have primary responsibility for water, sanitation, and hygiene at the household \nlevel and play a crucial role in influencing the hygiene behaviors of young children. Yet they often do not have the accompanying \npower in decision-making. Traditional gendered attitudes and behaviors continue to reflect privileges in favor of men and boys at \nhome and at work. An extremely low level of access to sanitation facilities in rural areas not only poses health risks to all but also \npsychological and safety risks to women and girls. Since it is viewed as women's work, men and boys are often not targeted or \nprioritized for participation in activities aimed at promoting hygiene behavior at home and in the village. Women\u2019s involvement \nwithout  the  accompanying  power  to  make  decisions  for  the  home  and  the  community  has  led  to  persistently  limited \nimprovements. Structural changes that could influence sanitation behavior and support men to accept women\u2019s stronger role in \ndecision making and planning have not been successful to date. For example, women are included among the core water and \nsanitation user group members, but their decision making is limited to the socially accepted domain of village leaders, who are \nmostly older literate men. At the national government level, gender beliefs and inequalities at work mean that the Ministry of \nRural Development, as well as the provincial and district offices of rural development, lacks female staff members.  \n \n ", "Appendix 10  53\n2.  Key Actions  \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \nThe gender action plan includes measures to (i) increase understanding of gender issues in RWSS at all levels, and (ii) \npromote women's meaningful participation in all project-supported activities (e.g., as peer-to-peer facilitators). Implementation \narrangements  include  working  through  each  commune  council's  committee  for  women  and  children,  collecting \nsex-disaggregated data, and ensuring that a measurable proportion of women participate as both project staff members and \nbeneficiaries. With a narrower geographical focus and a new structure of village-level facilitation that allows more time with \neach community, facilitators will reinforce women's participation at all levels. Resources for gender action plan implementation \nare integrated into the overall project budget through the community and participation plan and budget.  \nIII.

The Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (the Project) will bring \nsignificant benefit to rural residents in six provinces. The Project is expected to provide improved \nwater to 377,000 people and access to sanitation for 290,000. A gender action plan (GAP) has \nbeen prepared to ensure broad understanding of, and attention to, the different needs of men and \nwomen in the rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector. It will ensure equal opportunities \nfor women and men in terms of access to project benefits and participation in training. This GAP is \nbased on gender analysis undertaken as part of the poverty and social analysis, and is designed \naccording to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Policy on Gender and Development (1998).  \n \nA.  Background \n   \n2.  The total population of Cambodia is 13.4 million, of which about 6.9 million (51.5%) are \nwomen.1 About  10.8  million  people  (80%)  live  in  rural  areas.  Out  of  the  2.3  million  rural \nhouseholds, nearly one third (29%) are headed by women. Most female heads of household are \naged 40 and above (64%), and a majority (87%) participate in the labor force. The Cambodia \nMillennium Development Goal targets in the RWSS sector include access to an improved water \nsource for 50% of the rural population and access to improved sanitation for 30% of the rural \npopulation by 2015. Progress in water and sanitation is essential to achieving the related \nCambodia Millennium Development Goal of empowering women: \n(i)  reduced time, health, and care-giving burdens from improved water services give \nwomen  more  time  for  productive  endeavors,  adult  education,  empowerment \nactivities, and leisure;  \n(ii)  convenient  access  to  water  and  sanitation  facilities  increases  privacy  and \nreduces risk to women and girls of sexual harassment and assault; \n(iii)  higher  rates  of  child  survival  brought  about  by  access  to  safe  water  are  a \nprecursor to the demographic transition to lower fertility rates, as having fewer \nchildren  reduces  women\u2019s  household  responsibilities  and  increases  their \nopportunities for personal development; and  \n(iv)  community-based  organizations  for  water  management,  such  as  water  and \nsanitation user groups (WSUGs), can improve social capital by giving women \nleadership and networking opportunities and building solidarity among them. \n \n3.  Cambodia has made progress in improving gender equity and equality. The importance \nof gender equity is reflected in the national strategic development plan.2 In 1999, the Ministry of \nWomen\u2019s  Affairs  launched  its  first  5-year  strategy,  Neary  Rattanak  (Women  are  Precious \nGems). This was followed by Neary Rattanak II (2004\u20132008), and Neary Rattanak III will be \nfinalized in 2009. Since 2004, gender mainstreaming action groups have been established in \nmost technical ministries, including the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), and are chaired \nby a secretary or undersecretary of state. On 2 October 2006, the MRD gender mainstreaming \naction group approved the gender mainstreaming action plan for 2006\u20132010,3 and the group \nhas continued to increase MRD activities on gender issues and to collaborate with the Ministry \nof Women's Affairs. Greater involvement of and coordination with this group is planned under \nthe Project, as well as alignment with the policy for gender mainstreaming in MRD. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  National  Institute  of  Statistics,  Ministry  of  Planning.  2008.

Gender and Water Use and Hygiene Behavior \n \n4.  As  in  most  cultures,  women  and  girls  have  the  primary  responsibility  for  water, \nsanitation, and hygiene at the household level and play a crucial role in influencing the hygiene \nbehaviors of young children. Yet they often do not have the accompanying power in decision \nmaking. Traditional gendered attitudes and behaviors continue to reflect privileges in favor of \nmen and boys at home and at work. Issues include the following: \n(i)  Gender norms dictate that women and girls must maintain privacy of their body and \nbodily  functions  to  retain  a  good  reputation.  The  very  low  access  to  sanitation \nfacilities in rural areas not only poses health risks to all, but also psychological and \nsafety risks to women and girls. \n(ii)  Gender norms also mean that men and boys are often not targeted or prioritized for \nparticipation in activities aimed at promoting hygiene behavior at home and in the \nvillage. This tends to be viewed as \"female work.\" Women\u2019s involvement without the \naccompanying power to make decisions for the home and the community has led to \npersistently limited improvement. \n(iii)  Changes in structures that could influence sanitation behaviors and support men to \naccept  women\u2019s  stronger  role  in  decision-making  and  planning  have  not  been \nsuccessful. For example, women are included among the core members of WSUGs, \nbut in most cases, decision making is limited to the socially accepted domain of village \nleaders who are mostly (older, literate) men. \n(iv)  Gender inequalities at work mean that MRD lacks female staff members. Out of MRD's \n2005 staff complement of 1,432 officials, just 220 (15%) were women (footnote 3). This \nis particularly the case within the Department of Rural Water Supply and at subnational \nlevels (e.g., provincial departments of rural development [PDRD] and district offices of \nrural development). Only 1 out of 24 PDRD directors, 1 out of 70 PDRD deputy \ndirectors, 4 out of 57 chiefs of office, and 4 of 50 deputy chiefs of office were women.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n5.  Implementation arrangements and estimated costs of the GAP have been integrated into \nthe overall arrangements and total project budget. The PDRD project teams (with the support of \nnongovernment  organization  consultants  and  the  project  coordination  unit  [PCU])  will  be \nresponsible for implementing and monitoring GAP. The national gender specialist and other \nsocial consultants will (i) conduct gender awareness training for project units, (ii) support the \nestablishment  of  sex-disaggregated  indicators  for  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  (iii)  coordinate  with  other  specialists  during  subproject  preparation  and \nimplementation. The PDRD project teams will incorporate GAP monitoring in quarterly progress \nreports to the PCU, and the PCU will do the same in their reports to ADB and the Government.  \n \nD.  Summary Gender Action Plan  \n \n6.  The summary GAP (Table A11) has been prepared to show how the project will benefit \nboth men and women, and how it will address gender disparities in the RWSS sector. With a \nnarrower geographical focus and a new structure of commune- and village-level focal persons \nthat allows more time with each community, facilitators will reinforce women's participation at all \nlevels, ultimately leading to a greater role of women in decision making. \n \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \nTable A11: Summary Gender Action Plan \n \nProject Output  Actions Proposed \nOutput 1: Improved Community Health and Hygiene Practices \nActivities:  Select at least 50% women to serve as commune- and village-level focal persons. \n(i)  Increase community  Train commune- and village-level focal persons on gender issues, the GAP and its \nmobilization and action.   implementation.  \n(ii)  Prepare village water supply  Develop awareness among women, men, and children on health and hygiene issues \nand sanitation plans.  related to water use and sanitation.  \n(iii)  Form and train WSUGs. \nWork with the commune council women and children\u2019s affairs committee.  \n(iv)  Strengthen community groups \nEstablish WSUG boards with at least 40% women representation (at least two out of a \nand individuals for effective \nfive-person board), and reinforce messages of women's decision-making power.  \ndeliver of health and hygiene \nmessages.

A land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) for the Second Rural Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project (the Project) has been prepared to guide the preparation \nof resettlement action plans for subproject communes. A commune-level resettlement action \nplan (RAP) will consolidate any land acquisition and resettlement impacts of any rural water \nsupply and sanitation (RWSS) intervention. A full LARF is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n2.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Land acquisition and resettlement is \nexpected to be insignificant for the Project. Project interventions will require only small parcels \nof land for the construction of RWSS facilities in rural areas. Past experience with RWSS \nprojects in Cambodia confirms that subprojects can be designed without severely affecting \npeople. Each subproject commune will require that village water supply and sanitation plans be \nprepared, which will include assessment of scope of land acquisition and resettlement for the \nselected civil works in that village. As with the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector  Project  (TSRWSSP),1 water  facilities  (such  as  wells)  will  be  built  on  private  land. \nProtected ponds, small piped water systems, and public latrines will be built on public lands. In \ncase where the community or individual elects to make voluntary land contributions, the process \nwill be transparent and will not have undue socioeconomic impact on the affected landowner. \nThe cost of any contribution will be estimated and included as part of a water and sanitation \nuser group's (WSUG) contribution in kind. The Project will not relocate households for the \nrehabilitation  or  construction  of  RWSS  facilities.  The  location  of  RWSS  facilities  will  be \ndetermined using a participatory, community-based approach. In a majority of cases, permanent \nland acquisition for RWSS facilities will be minimal. However, the scope can only be determined \nonce the mix of interventions is decided by the communities.   \n3.  Legal and Policy Framework. There is no national policy for resettlement in Cambodia. \nThe current legislation governing land ownership is the Land Law (30 August 2001). This law \nsupersedes previous legislation and gives people access to land through the right of ownership, \nrecognized by Article 44 of the 1993 Constitution (24 September 1993), and states that no person \ncan be deprived of his or her ownership, unless it is in the public interest. The Constitution states \nthat the right to acquire land from any person will be exercised only in the public interest as \nprovided for under law and will require fair and just compensation. A draft expropriation law and a \ndraft resettlement subdecree are being reviewed by the Council of Ministers.  \n4.  Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) aims \nto avoid involuntary resettlement whenever possible, to minimize resettlement where population \ndisplacement is unavoidable, and to ensure that displaced persons receive assistance so they are \nat least as well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project. The policy stipulates \nthree important elements in involuntary resettlement (i) compensation for lost assets and loss of \nlivelihood and income, (ii) assistance in relocation including provision of relocation sites with \nappropriate facilities and services, and (iii) assistance with rehabilitation so as to achieve at least \nthe same level of well-being as before. The policy specifies that the absence of legal title to land \ncannot be considered an obstacle to compensation and rehabilitation privileges. All affected \npersons\u2014especially poor, landless, vulnerable, ethnic and religious minorities households\u2014are \neligible for compensation, transition allowance, and rehabilitation package. The principles and \nentitlements described in the LARF are based on national laws and regulations, ADB policy, and \npreviously approved resettlement plans for other ADB projects. Principles and provisions adopted \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Wherever a gap exists between \nCambodian and ADB policy, the latter will supersede.  \n5.  Affected  Persons.  Affected  persons  will  be  identified  during  subproject  social \nassessments during the preparation of village water supply and sanitation plans. A list of affected \npersons will be finalized after sites are selected and detailed designs are completed. The cut-off \ndate that sets the eligibility for entitlement will be determined accordingly. Lack of legal rights will \nnot affect the eligibility to compensation for land use, structure, and income losses. The types of \nproject-induced impacts are (i) loss of land, land use, and other assets (i.e., structures); (ii) loss of \nlivelihoods; and (iii) loss of community assets. Compensation and entitlements on the type of \nloss/impact and categories of affected persons are presented in the LARF's entitlement matrix. \nCompensation will be based on replacement cost surveys. Specific losses will be determined by \nsocioeconomic surveys, existing local conditions, market prices for goods, and other indicators. \nLand will, wherever possible, be replaced by land of equivalent quality and productivity.  \n6.  Implementation  Arrangements.  During  subproject  appraisal,  at  least  two  public \nmeetings involving affected persons will be held in subproject communes and, where applicable, \na preliminary assessment of scope of resettlement impacts will be prepared. If the village social \nassessment and census for each subproject commune identifies new categories of affected \npersons and types of loss that are not represented in the entitlement matrix, the commune RAP \nwill be revised by the provincial department of rural development (PDRD) before submission. \nThe PDRD will prepare the commune RAP and submit it to the project coordination unit for \nforwarding to the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) for endorsement. MRD will then submit \nit to the Interministerial Resettlement Committee of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (or \nany successor agency) for review and approval. MRD will then submit the approved plan to \nADB for concurrence. Approval must be given before resettlement activities can commence, \nand all RAP preparation activities must be completed before the award of work contracts.  \n7.  Each subproject RAP will contain the compensation budget for land, structures, other \nassets, crops and trees. Special assistance will be calculated using market rates to arrive at \nreplacement costs, and any associated costs will be based on rates stipulated in the LARF. The \nRAP budget will also include other costs involving disclosure, public consultations and focus \ngroup discussions, surveys, training and livelihood enhancement, and monitoring and evaluation. \nRAP costs are expected to be minimal and will be funded by the Government. A grievance \nredress mechanism must be in place, and a RAP independent external monitor (or individual \nconsultant) acceptable to ADB must be identified. Internal monitoring of commune RAPs will also \nbe conducted by the  project coordination unit through  PDRD  teams. A system of notifying, \ncompensating, and documenting payment to affected persons will also be established.  \n8.  Consultation with affected persons must start early during the subproject preparation. \nPDRDs and local authorities are responsible for ensuring that all potential beneficiaries and \naffected persons are properly and timely informed of subproject activities to be carried out. \nInformation to be disseminated should include the type of work to be implemented, potential \nimpacts, and schedules. A record of all consultations should be kept. All affected persons have \nthe right of appeal against any aspect of (i) decisions made that are not in accordance with the \nRAP; (ii) commitments given to them on which they disagree; or (iii) the level or manner of \ncompensation, including land, house, or shop or stall relocation and compensation. The main \nobjectives  of  the  grievance  procedure  are  to  provide  a  mechanism  to  (i)  ensure  that  the \ncompensation and resettlement program has been implemented accurately and fairly, (ii) alleviate \nany adverse effects on affected persons, and (iii) mediate conflict and avoid lengthy litigation. It \nalso provides people who have objections or concerns about their assistance with an accessible \nand known procedure through which to raise and resolve objections.  \n ", "Appendix 13  59\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n1.   The economic analysis includes assessment of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) \ninvestments using two sample subproject communes, Bos Sbov in Banteay Meanchey and Kbal \nTrach in Pursat.1 During implementation, the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject (the Project) will include similar small-scale investments in other communes, but the \ntechnical options will be determined under a participatory approach in the course of project \nimplementation. Therefore, a complete economic analysis of the entire Project is not yet possible. \nThis economic analysis demonstrates the economic justification of the subproject investments, \nand serves as a guide for the economic evaluation of succeeding subproject investments. \n2.   Rationale for Government Involvement in the RWSS Sector. The economic rationale \nfor the Government of Cambodia's involvement in RWSS is based largely on poverty reduction. \nThe Government's RWSS policy framework adopts the Cambodia Millennium Development \nGoal targets for RWSS; by year 2015, 50% of the rural population will have access to improved \nwater2 and 30% will have access to improved sanitation.3 The Government, as part of its RWSS \npolicy, will provide most of the initial capital investment for the Project. The water supply and \nsanitation user group (WSUG)  will manage the facilities after their completion and will be \nresponsible for all operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Based on the Tonle Sap Rural \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (TSRWSSP), 4  about  85%  of  the  WSUGs \nestablished are still active, and collection of O&M fees has not been problematic. Household \ncontribution will help to sustain the facility and to cover O&M costs.  \n3.   Main Assumptions. All monetary values are expressed in constant terms at June 2009 \nprices. The project life for the investment is assumed at 20 years, with no residual value at the \nend of the project life. The market exchange rate is KR4,106 per $1.00. All taxes and duties \nwere excluded from the costs, and the economic cost of unskilled labor was taken as 70% of the \nmarket wage rate. O&M cost is assumed at 5% of capital investment costs.  \n4.   Project Costs. The estimated economic project cost, in constant June 2009 prices, is \nabout KR2,585 million (or $532,043) for Bos Sbov, and KR798 million (or $382,332) for Kbal \nTrach. The investment cost includes water supply and sanitation outputs.  \n5.   Since the Project will serve hundreds of villages in various hydrologic and socioeconomic \nconditions, the Project does not propose a single, specific technology for either water supply or \nsanitation. Instead, the Project offers a set of recommended options, from which the communities \nwill choose their preferred option. The Project had evaluated several options for both water supply \nand sanitation. Water supply alternatives include deep-tube wells with hand pumps, shallow-tube \nwells with hand pumps, covered dug wells with hand pumps, combined wells with hand pumps, \nponds  with  either  communal  or  household  filtration,  rainwater  collection  and  storage,  and \n                                                 \n1  The project preparatory technical assistance also prepared a sample subproject of Pal Hal in Preah Vihear. The \nprovince was subsequently removed from the geographical focus of the Project. \n2  Includes (i) percent of families using drinking water from an improved source; (ii) percent of families with piped water, \nwells with pumps, or ring wells at their houses; and (iii) percent of families with access to communal taps, wells with \npumps, or ring wells. Water is available for the whole year and distance to the water facility is 150 meters or less. \n3  Includes flush or pour-flush latrines connected to a sewage system, flush or pour-flush latrines connected to a \nseptic tank or pit, pit latrines with slabs, or ventilated improved pit latrines. \n4  ADB. 2005.

Project Benefits. The main benefits quantified for the water supply facilities are time \nsavings in the collection of water and reduced costs for water storage and for water treatment \n(i.e., water filters and boiling). For the sanitation facilities, benefits quantified include avoided \nhealth  care  costs  and  productivity  loss  from  reduced  morbidity  and  mortality  rates  due  to \nwaterborne diseases. Waterborne diseases are mainly due to the poor sanitation and hygiene \npractices in the three communes (Table A13.2).  \nTable A13.2: Water-Borne Diseases \n  % HH Members Who Experienced Waterborne Disease Over the Year \nType of Illness  < 5 Years Old  > 5 Years Old  Adults  Never  Total \nKbal Trach \u2013 Pursat \nDiarrhea  6.3  9.4  15.6  68.7  100 \nDysentery  6.3  6.3  9.4  78.1  100 \nCholera  3.2  0  0  96.9  100 \nTyphoid  12.5  15.6  18.8  53.1  100 \nMalaria  0  6.3  6.3  87.5  100 \nDengue Fever  0  6.3  0  93.7  100 \nBos Sbov \u2013 Banteay Meanchey \nDiarrhea  13.9  21.7  18.3  46.1  100 \nDysentery  7.8  10.4  27.0  54.8  100 \nCholera  0  0  11.3  88.7  100 \nTyphoid  8.7  11.3  53.9  26.1  100 \nMalaria  0  0  11.3  88.7  100 \nDengue Fever  6.1  8.7  4.4  80.9  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n8.  In Bos Sbov (17 villages and 2,534 households), only 2.8% of households has latrines, \nand in Kbal Trach (4 villages and 628 households), only 1.3% has latrines. Those without \nlatrines travel 30\u2013600 meters to defecate in fields, forests, or yards. The Project, therefore, in \nthese three communes will also include provision of household latrines. Benefits can be realized \nby developing permanent water sources closer to homes, providing improved latrines, and \n ", "Appendix 13  61\nimparting proper hygiene education and behavioral change. Since population density in rural \nareas  is  quite  low,  developing  rural  water  supply  systems  requires  several  very  small \ninvestments, with a water supply facility serving a relatively small number of households.5  \n9.   The Project\u2019s water supply facilities will reduce the total economic cost of obtaining water \nfor  each  household.  Water  supplied  by  the  Project  will  replace  some  water  used  in  each \nhousehold (nonincremental demand). During the dry season, the Project is projected to replace \nmost water sources currently used by households, estimated at 8\u201315 liters6 per capita per day in \nthe two subprojects. During the rainy season, households will obtain some water from their current \nsources, especially rainwater. No incremental water demand is expected to be generated since \nthe design capacity of the proposed water facilities are 20 liters per capita per day on average.  \n10.   The total economic cost of nonincremental water is based on time spent on collection, \nstorage, and boiling or filtering before use. Time spent in collection was determined from the \nsocioeconomic surveys, and varies from 38 to 48 hours per household per month. The value of \ntime was measured at 70% of the official average rural wage of KR7,4207 per day. The existing \nstorage cost was estimated as KR205,000 for a two cubic meter storage capacity container, \nwith an average lifespan of 10 years. Households will continue to use storage facilities under the \nProject.

The sanitation output of the Project provides many private and social benefits, but the \neconomic analysis focuses only on the private benefits. Private benefits were quantified using \nthe per capita health care cost and productivity cost avoided. Due to poor sanitation, the \naverage per capita health care cost is $1.00 while the per capita productivity loss is $0.40.8 \n                                                 \n5  For non-piped system, number of households served per system varies from 10 to 20 for wells and from 150 to 200 \nhouseholds for community ponds. \n6  Average water consumption for drinking and cooking is 20 liters per capita per day and for washing and bathing is 26 \nto 28 liters per capita per day.

The time \nspent by the beneficiary to defecate in fields, forests, or yards was also quantified as cost \nsavings once the household toilets are utilized. On the average, a person in Bos Sbov would \ntravel 140 meters (one way) to defecate, while in Kbal Trach, a person would travel 60 meters \n(one way) to defecate. The Project has many other benefits that, due to constraints in time and \nresources, were not quantified. Other social benefits may follow from the reduced expenditure \nand time spent in collecting water, to the extent that the time and money saved is allocated to \nsocially beneficial activities like education. The sanitation output may also reduce latrine access \ntime and improved aesthetics (visual effects and smell).  \n12.   Benefit-Cost Analysis. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for Bos Sbov and \nKbal Trach subproject communes is 18.2 and 19.7, respectively. The EIRR takes into account the \ncapital investment for water supply and sanitation facilities, including the cost of the consultants \n(project management and capacity development) and incremental administration costs.9  \n13.  Sensitivity Analysis. Table A13.4 shows, for each commune, the percentage change \n(switching values) in capital costs and gross benefits that would drive the EIRR below the hurdle \nrate of 12% (assumed economic opportunity cost of capital). The economic benefits are generally \nless sensitive to changes in the capital and O&M costs than to changes in gross benefits. The \nsustainability of the Project will depend heavily on adequate O&M of the facilities to keep the cost \nof supply below the current water sources and to maintain the expected lifespan of the facilities.  \nTable A13.4:  Switching Values for Capital Costs, Operation and Maintenance Costs, \nand Gross Benefits (%) \nIncrease in  Increase in Operation  Decrease in  1 Year Delay in \nCommune \nCapital Costs  and Maintenance  Gross Benefits  Benefits \nBos Sbov  35  112  23  20 \nKbal Trach  41  143  27  23 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n14.  Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact. The Project will benefit various groups. The \nmost direct beneficiaries are the households that use the Project's water and those that choose to \nacquire private latrines. Among these beneficiaries, the benefit will increase with the decreasing \ndistance from the home to the water source. Households that choose not to acquire private \nlatrines may benefit from the latrines acquired by other households, if environmental quality \nimproves from the increased use of private latrines. Other beneficiaries include the owners and \nemployees of firms engaged in construction of the water supply facilities and private latrines. The \npoor will also benefit as consumers and through the supply of manual labor. They will also supply \nlabor and cash to the Project (Table A13.5).  \nTable A13.5: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratios  \n(KR million) \nCommune  Consumers  Government Labor Poverty Impact Ratio\nBos Sbov  1375  (1027)  15  0.44 \nKbal Trach  475  (311)  5  0.52 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n15.

The \nProject is unlikely to generate significant new tax revenues, so the government and taxpayers in \ngeneral will not recover much of the cost of the Project. \nB.  Financial Analysis \n16.   The  financial  analysis  includes  the  review  of  the  TSRWSSP,  assessment  of  the \nwillingness to pay, and affordability of the two sample subprojects.  \n17.  TSRWSSP Experience. A review of the implementation and O&M of the non-piped water \nsystems in Battambang and Pursat provinces was done based on TSRWSSP records. Household \ncapital contribution (water supply) for the construction cost for TSRWSSP is 10%, which was \nprovided in cash (3%) and in kind (7%), in the form of labor during project construction. The \namount of contribution is based on the contract amount. Households can provide labor through (i) \nfencing water supply facilities, (ii) digging wells, (iii) filling up and compacting the earth around \nwells or ponds built, and/or (iv) constructing the platforms for water supply facilities. In cases \nwhere a household cannot provide the 3% cash contribution, they can provide labor equivalent \nto 10% of the project cost, provided there is another household that is willing to pay a total of \n10% in cash. An estimate of the O&M costs for completed facilities is done to determine the \nmonthly contribution of the households served by the water facility. Money is collected by the \nWSUG head, and receipts are provided to households as proof of payment.  \n18.   Willingness-to-Pay for O&M. The socioeconomic survey conducted in the two sample \nsubprojects  revealed  that  households  are  willing  to  contribute  for  the  maintenance  of  the \ncompleted water facilities. Table A13.6 shows the amount the households are willing to pay every \nmonth. In Bos Sbov, 98.3% of the households are willing to pay KR500\u2013KR2,500 ($0.12\u2013$0.61) \nper month, while 97.4% of the households are willing to pay KR1,000\u20132,500 ($0.24\u2013$0.61) per \nmonth. In Kbal Trach, 93.8% of the households are willing to pay between KR500\u2013KR2,500 \n($0.12\u2013$0.61) per month. However, only 21.9% are willing to pay KR1,000\u2013KR2,500 ($0.24\u2013\n$0.61) per month and 71.9% of the households are only willing to pay KR500 ($0.12) per month.  \nTable A13.6: Willingness-to-Pay for Operation and Maintenance \n  Households willing to  Households willing to  Household  Household \n  pay KR500\u2013KR2,500  pay KR1,000\u2013KR2,500  Average   Average  \nCommune  (%)  (%)  (KR per month)  ($ per month) \nBos Sbov  98.3  97.4  1,829  $0.45 \nKbal Trach  93.8  21.9  1,142  $0.28 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.   A comparison of the projected monthly O&M fees and household income in the two \nsample subprojects was prepared (Table A13.7). Based on a capital investment of KR8 million \n(or $1,948.37) for a deep well with an Afridev hand pump, the estimated monthly O&M is about \nKR30,000 (or $7.31). Assuming 20 households are served by the water facility, the monthly \ncontribution for O&M is about KR1,500 (or $0.37) per household.  \nTable A13.7: Affordability of Operation and Maintenance Fees \n  Average Monthly  Lowest Monthly  Contribution  Contribution/ \n  Income       Income       per month   Lowest Monthly \nCommune  (KR\u2019000 and $)  (KR\u2019000 and $)  (KR '000 and $)  Income (%) \nBos Sbov  439 ($106.92)  83 ($20.21)  1.5 ($0.37)  1.8 \nKbal Trach  271 ($66.00)  44 ($10.72)  1.5 ($0.37)  3.4 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090825092549+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090918110454+08'00'", "Title": ""}, "author_page": " \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \nVice-President  C.
