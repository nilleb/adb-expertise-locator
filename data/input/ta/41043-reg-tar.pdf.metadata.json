The Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area \n(BIMP-EAGA)1 was launched in 1994 as a key strategy of the participating governments to \naccelerate economic growth in their less developed and more remote territories. Following \nsignificant early gains, cooperation initiatives in EAGA weakened in the 1997\u20132001 period as a \nresult of a series of economic reverses set off by the Asian financial crisis. As growth returned to \nthe  region,  regional  leaders  meeting  at  the  7th  ASEAN  Summit  in  Brunei  Darussalam  in \nNovember 2001 reaffirmed their commitment to revitalize BIMP-EAGA. At the same meeting, \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) was appointed EAGA\u2018s Regional Development Advisor. ADB \nhas since played a supportive role in reviving, revitalizing and repositioning EAGA in the context \nof an evolving regional and global economic landscape.  \n \n2.  The major thrusts of the BIMP-EAGA cooperation initiative have been to promote trade, \ninvestment and tourism. The importance of trade facilitation in accelerating economic growth \nand in sustaining poverty reduction in the subregion was recognized from the beginning by local \nbusiness  communities  and  participating  governments.  Trade  facilitation  issues  identified \nrevolved around non-physical barriers to the efficient movement of people and goods, including \nprocessing and documentation of transactions generally classified under four interrelated areas: \ncustoms, immigration, quarantine and security (CIQS).2 In 2002, EAGA initiated cooperation in \ntrade  facilitation  by  creating  the  CIQS  Task  Force.  At  the  request  of  the  Philippines,  the \ndesignated lead country for the CIQS harmonization efforts, ADB conducted a study of the \nCIQS environment in EAGA. The study identified major issues and potential constraints on \nharmonization of CIQS rules, regulations and procedures (RRP) in EAGA. The study proposed \nmeasures to hasten the harmonization process using international and regional conventions and \nprotocols as benchmarks. As a result, bilateral meetings were held between 2003 and 2005 to \ndiscuss specific harmonization issues relating to existing port-to-port arrangements, including \nsea and airports. At the second EAGA Summit held in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005, the \nparticipating countries\u2019 leaders agreed to strengthen cooperation and carry out necessary policy \nand regulatory reforms to improve the CIQS and trade facilitation environment, in addition to \nstepping up the delivery of related infrastructure. As Regional Development Advisor, a key task \nfor  ADB  is  to  facilitate  the  cross-border  harmonization  process.  The  regional  technical \nassistance (RETA),3 which was formally endorsed by the CIQS Task Force at a meeting in \nBrunei  Darussalam  on  19-20  April  2007,  will  provide  the  means  to  help  EAGA  member \ncountries  expedite  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  agreements  to  streamline  and \neventually harmonize CIQS RRP. See Appendix 1 for the TA framework.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The BIMP-EAGA focal areas are physically closer to each other than to the capitals and \neconomic centers of their respective countries. EAGA\u2019s geography provides different areas in \nthe subregion with opportunities to trade with one another or directly with the rest of the world. \nHowever,  weak  subregional  inter-modal  transport  systems  and  cumbersome  cross-border \nprocedures  have  stunted  trade  and  tourism.  Various  measures  have  been  or  are  being \nundertaken to improve infrastructure, and modest progress has been achieved in creating more \nextensive transportation links across the subregion. However, increasing connectivity within \n                                                 \n1  BIMP-EAGA  is  also  referred  to  as  EAGA.  EAGA  covers  all  of  Brunei  Darussalam;  Indonesia\u2019s  Sulawesi, \nKalimantan, Maluku and Irian Jaya provinces; Malaysia\u2019s federal states of Sabah and Sarawak and federal territory \nof Labuan; and Mindanao and Palawan islands in the Philippines. EAGA has an estimated population of 55 million. \n2  The Asian Development Outlook 2006 identified four sets of issues critical for development. One was security, \nincluding the need to facilitate the efficient and safe transit of commodities across borders.   \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 March 2007. \n ", "2   \nEAGA and a growing recognition of the complementarities in subregional trade and travel mean \nstronger measures are now required to expedite cooperation in harmonizing CIQS RRP. \n \n4.  CIQS harmonization in EAGA is a complex and labor-intensive process because of the \nmany national and local government agencies as well as private sector organizations across the \nfour countries, and also because the initiative is being carried out at the subregional and \nsubnational levels. To be effective, it will require an integrated response from the various CIQS \nagencies and extensive consultations with private sector stakeholders. Information exchange \nand coordination are critical. An important first step toward harmonization is to establish a \nplatform for the regular and timely exchange of information and sharing of experience among \nCIQS agencies at the national and subregional levels. It is envisoned that the CIQS Task Force \nwill be the institutional mechanism for this coordination and information exchange. Although \ncreated in 2002, the task force was only formally constituted in 2006 after a series of bilateral \nand multilateral discussions about harmonization. The need to strengthen the task force\u2019s role \nand capacity as a consultative forum and catalyst for CIQS harmonization is widely recognized, \nespecially by the private sector. Subregional harmonization efforts need the support of a strong \nand functional country-level coordination mechanism that involves CIQS representatives at the \nnational and provincial levels as well as at border crossings and ports.  \n \n5.  The CIQS environment in EAGA is influenced by the degree to which commitments have \nbeen  made  by  individual  member  governments  to  various  international  agreements, \nconventions, protocols and treaties. Studies, including the ADB assessment, show that BIMP-\nEAGA countries have different levels and modes of compliance with such agreements, resulting \nin varying CIQS regimes and documentation requirements. A subregional economic cooperation \ninitiative  that  aims  to  increase  the  movement  of  people,  goods  and  services  requires \nharmonizing the differing CIQS RRP. Recognizing that not all RRP can be fully harmonized \nbecause  of  differences  in  national  policies  (for  example,  to  protect  employment,  national \nsecurity and public morals), the EAGA countries have agreed to adopt more flexible measures \nand a phased approach to harmonizing technical regulations and standards as well as CIQS \nprocesses.  \n \n6.  An  important  aspect  of  progress  toward  harmonization  will  involve  improving \ntransparency, consistency and predictability in cross-border CIQS procedures and practices. \nThese have long been recognized by the private sector as problems. These problems are \nexacerbated by a lack of awareness and understanding of RRP even among CIQS agencies. \nEarlier proposals to compile and widely circulate the CIQS RRP of the member countries need \nto be revived and implemented. As a start, CIQS procedures and documentary requirements at \nselected priority ports and border crossings will be mapped to identify the major differences in \npractices and formalities to enable the CIQS Task Force to discuss the issues and formulate \nstrategies and action plans to address them. \n \n7.  Recent developments also indicate an increased awareness and greater willingness \namong  EAGA  countries  and  concerned  agencies  to  implement  regulatory  and  procedural \nreforms. For instance, leaders attending the third EAGA Summit in Cebu City, Philippines, on 12 \nJanuary 2007 (in conjunction with the ASEAN Summit) agreed to use BIMP-EAGA as a test \ncase for the implementation of ASEAN agreements on transport and trade facilitation. However, \nto ensure the sustainability and acceptability of this approach, the first measures and steps to \nbe  undertaken  should  involve  low-level  technology  with  low  or  no  innovation  cost.  These \nmeasures should be easy to implement and result in immediate benefits. Some of the measures \nbeing  discussed  include  conducting  joint  customs  inspections  and  setting  up  one-stop \ndocumentation processing facilities at selected border crossings. ADB can support this by \nsharing experience gained and best practices developed from implementing transport and trade \n ", "  3   \n \nfacilitation  measures  in  other  subregional  cooperation  schemes,  such  as  the  cross-border \ntransport agreement in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).  \n \n8.  Representatives from EAGA CIQS agencies, as well as development partners who \nparticipated in a CIQS needs assessment workshop in Manila in August 2006,4 all agree that \ninvesting  in  human  capital  through  continuing  training  and  capacity  building  is  a  critical \ncomponent for any successful trade facilitation initiative. A lack of technical capacity, especially \namong CIQS agencies at the subregional level, as well as limited enforcement of regulations \nconstrain the implementation of trade facilitation measures and other trade-related reforms. \nInternational organizations5 with trade-related training capabilities and bilateral partners (for \nexample, German development assistance through GTZ and AusAID) with a presence in the \nsubregion will be asked to assess training needs and participate in building the capacity of CIQS \nagencies. Regional training institutions will likewise be involved to provide a more regional \nperspective to capacity building and training programs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  Overall,  the  TA  is  expected  to  enhance  the  integration  of  EAGA  economies  by \nstrengthening CIQS operations. This will be done by supporting cooperation in security and \nfacilitating trade and the movement of people and goods across borders. This is expected to \nlead to the expansion of intra-industry and intra-firm economic links, in turn quickening regional \ngrowth and development. The TA aims to assist the EAGA countries to (i) strengthen the role of \nthe  CIQS  Task  Force  as  a  catalyst  for  the  CIQS  harmonization  process,  (ii)  establish  or \nenhance national institutional mechanisms to coordinate effectively the CIQS harmonization \ninitiatives,  (iii)  formulate  strategies  and  implement  action  plans  to  streamline,  simplify  and \nharmonize CIQS processes and formalities at ports of entry and border crossings, and (iv) build \nthe capacity of CIQS focal points in the subregion. Specific outputs of the TA are outlined in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Consistent  with  the  decision  of  the  concerned  BIMP-EAGA  member  officials,  the \napproach to harmonization will be phased. While reasonably comprehensive, the geographic \nscope of the assistance will be limited to priority ports and border crossings selected on the \nbasis of the levels of movement of people and goods, to maximize the benefits of CIQS \nharmonization of processes and documents. The TA will have two components. The first is to \nstrengthen  subregional  and  national  institutional  structures  and  mechanisms  for  effective \ncoordination and sustained implementation of the CIQS harmonization initiatives. The second \nand key component is process harmonization, which will address the complexity of institutional, \nadministrative and regulatory issues. It will do this by undertaking phased activities that lead to \nimplementation  of  flexible  and  mutually  acceptable  trade  facilitation  agreements  involving \nselected ports and border crossings. The emphasis of the TA will be on the second component. \nKey TA activities aimed at strengthening subregional and national institutional structures and \nmechanisms include the following. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n4  The workshop was organized by ADB and GTZ. \n5  International organizations include ASEAN, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International \nMaritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the World \nCustoms Organization (WCO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). \n ", "4   \n1.  Strengthening  Subregional  and  National  Institutional  Structures  and \nMechanisms \n11.  Country  level.  The  TA  will  assist  in  establishing  and  enhancing  country-level  and \nsubregional  institutional  structures  and  mechanisms  to  coordinate  the  CIQS  harmonization \nefforts effectively. At the country level, the TA will assist member countries to establish national \nCIQS  councils  or  committees,  which  will  be  responsible  to  ensure  consistent  national \ncommitment  and  responsiveness  to  the  subregional  CIQS  harmonization  initiatives  and \ninclusion of the subregional CIQS harmonization programs in national development priorities.  \n \n12.  Subregional level. The TA will help to strengthen the role of the EAGA CIQS Task \nForce by providing technical and logistics support to (i) conduct consultation and policy dialogue \namong CIQS agencies, between CIQS agencies and the private sector, and between the CIQS \nTask Force and the different clusters and working groups to identify concerns, issues and \nactions  to  facilitate  harmonization;  (ii)  prepare  an  integrated  response  and/or  subregional \nharmonization strategy and work programs; (iii) prepare, negotiate and implement agreements \nand protocols; and (iv) prepare and implement a results-oriented monitoring and evaluation \nsystem. The TA will also provide support for the development of networks, information systems \nand information dissemination to promote awareness and understanding of issues related to \nsubregional  economic  integration.  Support  for  high-level  meetings  of  CIQS  agencies  will \nlikewise be provided to ensure that quick decisions are made on the most pressing issues. \n \n  2.  Support for the Harmonization Process \n \n13.  Process  Mapping  and  Analysis  of  Current  CIQS  RRP.  The  TA  provides  for  a \ncomprehensive  mapping  and  analysis  of  current  CIQS  processes  and  documentary \nrequirements at major EAGA ports, including regular international ports of entry and designated \nEAGA ports of entry. This is aimed at (i) identifying differences and gaps in CIQS procedures \nand documents, (ii) facilitating the formulation of solutions to address the gaps, and (iii) building \nconsensus among member countries on the required regulatory and procedural reforms to \nstreamline, simplify and harmonize processes, formalities and documentary requirements. The \nTA will help to ensure that the proposed reforms are aligned with international conventions, \nprotocols  and  best  practices.  ADB  will  draw  lessons  from  experience  gained  in  other \nsubregional growth areas (for example, the GMS and the Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand Growth \nTriangle)  and  other  international  organizations  (e.g.,    the  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization  (ICAO),  the  International  Maritime  Organization  (IMO),  the  United  Nations \nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the World Customs Organization (WCO), \nthe World Health Organization (WHO)) in trade facilitation. The TA will also assist in obtaining \nthe endorsement of the EAGA Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting (SOM) of the proposed strategies and \nwork programs. \n \n14.  Formulate  Agreements.  Once  consensus  is  reached  on  the  nature  and  scope  of \nreforms, the TA will provide technical and legal expertise for drafting, negotiating and signing \nthe necessary legal documents, agreements and protocols to formalize arrangements on the \nagreed regulatory, enforcement and procedural reforms. During the process of preparing the \ndocuments, the ASEAN Secretariat\u2019s assistance will be obtained to ensure that the reforms are \ncompatible and consistent with or complementary to existing regional agreements on security, \ntransport and trade facilitation.  \n \n15.  Pilot Test Implementation of Agreements. The TA will support implementation of the \nagreements  and  provide  further  assistance  to  prepare  time-bound  memorandums  of \nunderstanding and/or guidelines for implementation at each of the priority ports. The TA will also \n ", "  5   \n \nprovide  assistance  in  (i)  preparing  implementation  manuals  and  instructional  media,  (ii) \nmonitoring the timely implementation of agreements, (iii) facilitating the resolution of potential \nbottlenecks in implementation and gaps in enforcement measures, (iv) fully documenting the \nexperiences and lessons learned to facilitate possible replication in other EAGA ports, (iv) \nconducting comparative \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d studies on border-crossing clearance time and \neffectiveness  of  security  and  facilitation  measures,  and  (v)  continuing  dialogues  and \nconsultations with port users, traders and local CIQS agencies to engage their support in the \nimplementation and sustainability of the reforms. \n \n16.  Provide Demand-Driven Capacity Building Activities. The RETA will assist in the \nassessment and provision of on-site training needs to build the capacity of local CIQS agencies \nto sustain the implementation of streamlined, simplified and harmonized CIQS procedures and \nborder-crossing formalities. The RETA will co-finance the preparation and implementation of \ntraining  programs  and  capacity  building  activities  with  relevant  international  organizations \n(including  ASEAN,  ICAO,  IMO,  UNCTAD,  WCO,  WHO,  and  WTO)  and  other  EAGA \ndevelopment partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $600,000, to be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Cooperation Fund for Regional Trade and Financial Security Initiative and administered by \nADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA. \nIt will do this in close consultation with the CIQS Task Force, the BIMP-EAGA Facilitation \nCenter and the national secretariats of the BIMP-EAGA member countries.  \n \n19.  The TA will finance about 55 person-months of consultant services\u201435 international and \n20 national. Consultants will also be engaged to conduct short-term studies. The consultants will \nbe hired as individuals and engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2006, as amended from time to time). See Appendix 3 for the consultants\u2019 outline \nterms of reference. ADB will be actively involved in implementing the TA, including the conduct \nof workshops facilitated by it. ADB staff will be used as resource persons when appropriate. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from July 2007 to December 2008.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed \non a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for Regional Trade and Financial Security Initiative for \nthe Support for Customs, Immigration, Quarantine, and Security Harmonization in the Brunei \nDarussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6   \nAppendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nAccelerated integration of  \u2022  Increase in intra-regional  \u2022  Progress reports to the  \u2022  Continued political \nEAGA economies through  trade and tourism by 5%  SOM/MM/Leaders  commitment of participating \nstrengthened cooperation  per annum  Meeting by various  governments to regional \nin security and trade  \u2022  Development of trade  working groups, BEBC,  cooperation  \nfacilitation.  hubs and consolidating  BIMPFC  \u2022  Regional economic stability \n  ports for import/export  \u2022  Statistical databases of  and growth at least \nactivities  the member countries  maintained \n\u2022  New private sector  including of BIMP FC   \u2022  Participating Governments \ninvestments in transport  remain committed to \nservices  implementing the strategies \n  and undertaking reforms \n  \u2022  Resources must be \n  adequately devoted to \n  problems.
