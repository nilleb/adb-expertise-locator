INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  the  Government  of \nMongolia strengthen the institutional capacity of public utility service organizations (PUSOs) and \nwill enhance the sustainability of investments financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by \nimproving  the  PUSOs\u2019  technical  capacity  to  provide  reliable  and  safe  water  supply  and \nwastewater services. \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 Operational Plans1 and is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2020\u20132021 for Mongolia.2 It will support the government \nin achieving the objectives of the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision, 20303and the \n \nGovernment Action Plan, 2020\u20132024;4 and will further strengthen ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge \ninstitution.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Since 1997, ADB has invested more than $150 million in helping the government respond \nto the urgent demand for provincial urban services and improved livability, and address urban\u2013\nrural inequality and air, soil, and groundwater pollution. ADB has cooperated with the Ministry of \nConstruction and Urban Development (MCUD), with whom ADB has a long-term partnership, to \nimprove basic urban services across Mongolia. To address sector institutional deficiencies, a \nrange of within-project components and parallel TA projects have been provided, with a focus on \nPUSO  institutional  reforms  and  strengthening  capacity  in  financial  management  and \nadministration. Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s prior support include the following: (i) the increasing \nskills obsolescence of the technical workforce is a key constraint on both the timely and efficient \nexecution of investment projects, and the long-term sustainability of the assets created; (ii) \nreorganization of the government\u2019s structure and management after political changes often leads \nto the appointment of new officials or project management staff, creating a major challenge for \nefficient project and TA processing and implementation; (iii) projects should finance adequate \noperations and maintenance (O&M) to ensure resource availability in the early stages of operation; \n(iv) project stakeholders should be provided with targeted capacity building on ADB safeguard \npolicies and community engagement practices; (v) an effective and functional grievance redress \nmechanism should be established, with clear roles, responsibilities, and a budget allocated; and \n(vi) close partnerships with nongovernment organizations are important to detect and address \ngrievances.  \n \n4.  The elements of existing government policy, strategy, and legislation6 indicate a trajectory \nfor the growth and development of the public utility services sector and suggest where priority \ninvestments should be focused in the short to medium term. The MCUD has overall responsibility \nfor formulating policies and regulations in the sector and for monitoring and coordinating their \n \n1  ADB.

At the aimag and soum level, local governments implement policies and manage \nwater supply and wastewater services but have limited financial and institutional resources to \nfulfill these responsibilities effectively through their respective PUSOs. \n \n5.  It  has  been  observed  under  past  and  ongoing  ADB-supported  water  supply  and \nwastewater projects that, in addition to mandatory training provided to the operators by civil works \ncontractors, suppliers, and consultants before the systems are put into operation, there is a need \nto update the skills and knowledge of PUSO technical staff to ensure the effective operation of \nnewly constructed systems. Currently, 205 PUSOs provide water supply, wastewater, and partial \ndistrict heating services to residents as well as public and business entities in urban settlements \nacross Mongolia. Of these PUSOs, 36 operate in aimag and soum centers. PUSOs employ \n10,950 staff, of whom 40% are women and 42% work in provincial utility organizations. Of the \nPUSO staff members, 18% are engineers and technicians who manage and operate the systems, \nand 29% of these are women. Common features of technical streams in utilities operations that \ndo not cater the needs of women include unsupportive workplace environments and rotational \nand night shiftwork. Hence, most women who work in water utilities tend to be employed in \nadministration, customer relations, and finance and accounting, and few are employed in the \ntechnical domains of engineering, supervision, and O&M. Improved workplace environments, \nflexible arrangements to ensure work-life balance, and increased training opportunities will help \nPUSOs retain female technical staff.  \n \n6.  Acute funding constraints on capital investments and poor O&M have led to dilapidated \ninfrastructure and ineffective services as a result of high losses from leaks, frequent breakdowns, \nand  excessive  repair  costs.  These  limitations  have  undermined  consumer  confidence  and \nwillingness to pay for the services, and have increased the reluctance of the Urban Water Supply \nand Wastewater Services Regulatory Commission7 (henceforth referred to as the regulator) to \nraise service tariffs, further constraining PUSOs\u2019 financial and institutional performance.  \n \n7.  Regular skills development of PUSO technical staff and the dissemination of knowledge \nand information on updated standards, norms, and regulations with respect to the construction \nand  operation  of  facilities  are  essential  for  sustaining  the  sector\u2019s  effective  and  efficient \nperformance. The Mongolian University of Science and Technology trains water supply and \nwastewater  engineers,  while  technical  and  vocational  education  training  centers  provide \ntechnicians  (e.g.,  plumbers,  laboratorians,  and  electricians)  with  professional  qualifications. \nFurther enhancing the skills and accreditation of PUSO staff is the responsibility of the Training, \nResearch, and Information Division of the MCUD\u2019s Construction Development Center. However, \nthe division\u2019s capacity and diverse training topics8 make it impossible to organize regular and \ntargeted sessions for PUSO employees.  \n \n8.  To address the PUSOs\u2019 institutional capacity and skills obsolescence, the regulator \nestablished the Training, Research and Data Center for Public Utility Services Sector in 2020. \nThis institution, referred to as the regulator\u2019s training center (RTC), is at an early stage of formation, \nand needs support in developing training concepts and modules and equipping training classes. \nThe RTC has a separate unit focusing on community awareness, education, and communications, \n \n7  Established in 2012 with advisory support from ADB, the Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Services Regulatory \nCommission is responsible for setting tariffs and licensing, as well as evaluating, monitoring, and regulating the \nperformance of PUSOs nationwide.  \n8  The division trains staff in the construction, urban development, and infrastructure sectors on construction codes and \nnorms, architecture, land management and valuation, cadasters, geodesy and cartography, occupational health and \nsafety, cost estimation, and other topics. \n ", "3   \n \nas well as the dissemination of best practices9 across the PUSOs. This TA is designed to establish \nan effective mechanism, working closely with the RTC for the technical training of PUSO staff, \nwith a focus on provincial operators. As such, ADB will support the development of a professional \ntraining center for PUSO staff in line with civil society recommendations.10  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: urban water supply and wastewater services \nin Mongolia improved. The TA will have the following outcome: knowledge and skills of PUSO \ntechnical staff applied.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Policy advice on public utility service organizations\u2019 technical training \nstrategy finalized. This output will help establish a mechanism building on the RTC to address \nthe knowledge and skills obsolescence of PUSO technical staff. The following activities will be \ncompleted: (i) develop a methodology for assessing the PUSOs\u2019 human resource, technical \ncapacity, and training needs; (ii) conduct a gender-inclusive situational analysis on the current \ncapacity of PUSO engineers and technicians; (iii) assess technical training needs over the short \nand medium term to ensure the effective delivery of services, and review key constraints (access, \ndirect and indirect costs, availability, quality, and gender gaps); (iv) review the country\u2019s training \ncapacity  for  upskilling  PUSO  technical  staff  by  assessing  existing  training  infrastructure \n(institutions,  programs,  and  courses),  governance  structure,  resource  availability  (human, \nequipment,  and  financial),  facilities,  and  other  elements  (teaching  aids,  curricula,  teaching \nmaterials, and demonstration and practical training sites); (v) develop a gender-responsive \ntechnical training strategy; and (vi) develop a monitoring framework to assess the performance of \nthe strategy. \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity of the regulator\u2019s training center strengthened. The TA will help \nthe regulator develop a professional training center for PUSO technical staff. The TA activities are \nas follows: (i) formulate a detailed annual plan11 for PUSO technical training; (ii) develop at least \n10 gender-responsive training modules,12 including four mandatory modules on (a) O&M of \n \n9   In 2019, the water operator\u2019s partnership program, financed by Regional Technical Assistance 6498: Knowledge \nand Innovation Support for ADB\u2019s Water Financing Program, developed and implemented an education and \ncommunity engagement strategy for the PUSO in Uvurkhangai aimag. Community consultations, public awareness \nevents, and tours of the new wastewater treatment plant constructed under the ADB project helped disseminate \nknowledge about the PUSO operations while establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with the public \nbeing served. \n10 These  recommendations  were  made  during  consultations  in  April  and  September  2020  with  civil  society \norganizations on the country partnership strategy for Mongolia. \n11  This includes (i) the list and scope of technical training modules to be introduced to the RTC; (ii) the scope and \nbudget for enhancing RTC facilities and equipment; (iii) measures for improved financial management and \nsustainability; (iv) measures for improved human resources management; (v) plans for preparing the new training \nmodules and their renewal or updating; (vi) plans for training trainers on the new or improved training modules; (vii) \nplans for monitoring and evaluating training methods and approaches, including the assessment of the efficacy and \nimpact of conducted training sessions; (viii) plans to enhance effective cooperation with relevant international \ntraining organizations, if desired; and (ix) other measures needed to improve the efficacy and sustainability of RTC \noperations. For each plan and activity, gender issues must be considered. \n12  For each module, the TA will (i) formulate an appropriate training methodology reflecting national and international \nbest practices, new technologies, and innovation; (ii) test the modules with at least 300 PUSO technical staff \n \n ", "4   \n \nwastewater treatment plants similar to those supported by ADB,13 (b) decentralized sludge \nmanagement,  (c)  sewage  sludge  re-use  approaches,  and  (d)  civil  society  and  community \nengagement and education on utility services (topics for the six remaining training modules will \nbe defined upon completion of the training needs and capacity assessments);14 (iii) organize \ninternational training tours of peer training entities in ADB member countries for concerned staff \nof  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies; (iv)  improve  RTC training  facilities,  including \nfurniture and office equipment for training classes, as well as tools, equipment, and materials for \npractical training units; and (v) develop a knowledge product on the PUSO technical training \nstrategy, annual plan, and training modules, which will be presented and distributed at workshops \nand meetings, and through websites and media to stakeholders in Mongolia (e.g., government \nagencies, PUSOs, and training institutes).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $745,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff \nremuneration, office space for the consultants, data and information, training venues, staff time \nto review consultants\u2019 outputs, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s East Asia Department, through its Mongolia Resident Mission, will administer the \nTA. The MCUD will be the executing agency and the regulator will be the implementing agency. \nThe MCUD\u2019s existing steering committee for externally financed urban sector projects will provide \noverall policy guidance and will evaluate the TA implementation quarterly, or as often as required. \nADB will regularly review the TA progress during quarterly portfolio review meetings and TA \nreview  missions.  For  day-to-day  administration,  the  TA  project  will  establish  a  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) consisting of a part-time TA coordinator and part-time finance and \nadministration officer. The PIU will be responsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables \nin a timely and effective manner, and for organizing and carrying out all TA activities. The PIU will \nreport to the ADB project officer. The PIU will establish a separate advance payment facility at a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and in line with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time).  \n \n14.  The coronavirus disease pandemic is not expected to affect implementation arrangements \nor cost estimates. The expertise required to implement the TA is available in the country, limiting \ndependency on international consultants. Desk reviews, assessments, and the development of \nstrategy, an annual plan and training modules, and consultations can be conducted from the home \noffice or virtually. The TA will take appropriate measures to engage safely with stakeholders \nduring meetings and training activities. Slight delays in testing the training modules may occur if \nthe pandemic continues beyond 2022. \n \n(including 30% women); (iii) train RTC trainers; and (iv) consider gender equality and inclusiveness, where \nappropriate. \n13 ADB. 2014.
