The Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan has requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the transport sector development strategy \n(2006\u20132020). The TA1 is included in the Country Strategy and Program Update 2004\u20132006 for \nUzbekistan. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Uzbekistan in April 2005 to formulate the TA and \nreached agreement with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing \nplan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Uzbekistan is a historical land bridge between east and west (from the People\u2019s Republic \nof China to Europe), as well as north and south (from Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and the \nBaltics to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf). Transport links, which were developed focusing on \nthe north towards Russian Federation, must now be updated to meet Uzbekistan\u2019s political and \neconomic requirements. After several years of decline in the volume of transportation flow, \nrecovery is now well underway in Uzbekistan. This has had a positive impact on trade and \ntransport activities. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.7% in 2004. In terms of value, \nforeign trade has grown by about 3% to 4% per year since 1997 and exports are much higher \nthan imports.2 Uzbekistan is a key player in regional transport, carrying not only its own trade \nbut also considerable volumes of Central Asia transit traffic. Recent forecasts suggest that, on \nmuch of the transport network, short-term annual growth will be about 2\u20133% for rail freight traffic \nand 4\u20137% for road traffic. Reflecting the reorientation of trade patterns, and development of \nindustry and local resources, transport bottlenecks are expected to occur in the short to medium \nterm. Such bottlenecks will inhibit economic growth, if not removed. Therefore, development of \ntransport networks and infrastructure is critical to achieve efficient transport and transit systems \nin  Uzbekistan  and  the  region,  to  promote  economic  development  and  integration  into \ninternational commerce. \n \n3.  Uzbekistan is a focal point for international transit trade in the east-west (People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Central Asia, and Europe) and north-south (from Russian Federation, to \nSouth Asia and Iran). It is signatory to a number of bilateral and multilateral agreements with \nneighboring  countries  and  international  organizations  for  facilitating  international  transport \nthrough the country.  \n \n4.  Uzbekistan\u2019s road system comprises 43,500 km of major highways and 141,300 km of \nother roads. It provides connections to all provinces, communities, and neighboring countries. \nThe role of road transport in the national economy is increasing. However, the design capacity \nof roads is limited and the deteriorating quality of physical assets is of major concern. The key \nproblems  facing  Uzbekistan\u2019s  road  transport  system  are  (i)  lack  of  good  quality  roads \nconnecting production centers, markets and providing access to ports; (ii) poor and deteriorating \ninfrastructure, including road-side services, and telecommunication facilities; (iii) inadequate \nconstruction quality; (iv) lack of safety awareness, (v) incomplete legal framework, lack of \ncommon standards, nonconformity with international standards, international road permit quotas \nwhich restrict competition, lack of level playing field for transport services, road user charges \nunrelated to road use cost, excessive discriminatory transit fees, and inadequate access to \ntransport  by  private  sector;  and  (vi)  (for  regional  traffic)  inefficient  border  controls  due  to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 15 February 2005. \n2  In 2004, total exports were $4,263 million on a free on board (fob) basis and total imports were $3,061 million on a \ncost, insurance, freight (cif) basis. \n ", "2     \nexcessive bureaucratic requirements, excessive road-side checks, ineffective vehicle weighing \nand loads, controls not based on international best practices and international conventions, and \npoorly equipped border posts. \n \n5.  The length of the rail network is 3,993 km and its density (about 9 km per 1,000 square \nkm of land) is higher than any of the neighboring countries. International transport\u2014both export \nand import\u2014is overwhelmingly by rail, accounting for over 88% of exports (2003) and 80% of \nimports (2003). However, railway infrastructure needs major investment as it has deteriorated \nsubstantially. The key issues affecting the rail transport system are (i) lack of competition in \nsupply of railway services, lack of management information tools, obsolete rolling stock, and \noutdated  internal  telecommunications  technology;  (ii)  lack  of  modern  technologies  and \nmarketing initiatives; (iii) numerous obstacles to cross-border procedures\u2014such as frequent \nchanges  of  locomotives  on  the  borders,  time-consuming  border  formalities,  complicated \ndocumentation requirements at borders, and inter-railway payment delays, resulting from the \nbreakdown of the former railway network system; and (iv) tariffs that do not separate movement \nand terminal costs, lack of convenient billing systems, and lack of consignment information for \nshippers. \n \n6.  Uzbekistan\u2014a strategically located, doubly landlocked country\u2014has huge potential for \ngrowth in air traffic. It could be developed as a major regional air transportation hub for both \nfreight and passengers. The major issues affecting the air transport system are modernization, \ntariff  policies,  institutional  development,  provision  of  improved  services,  and  attracting \ninvestment. \n \n7.  The major issues affecting the urban transport system are lack of integrated urban \ntransport  planning  and  resource  constraints,  which  restrict  much-needed  rehabilitation  and \nexpansion necessary to overcome traffic congestion and pollution.  \n \n8.  Transport-related ancillary services (including freight forwarders) are provided by various \nprivate sector transport and forwarders\u2019 organizations. Privatization is high on the Government\u2019s \nreform agenda for the transport sector. Although state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\u2014railways and \nairlines\u2014are corporatized as joint stock companies and the Government has introduced a \nnumber of measures to separate regulatory and commercial functions in the transport sector, \nthe Government is seeking further ADB support to fast-track this process. This will promote \ngreater private sector involvement, including investments in transport infrastructure.  \n \n9.  Steady economic growth and the importance of transport in Uzbekistan\u2019s economic \ndevelopment have led the Government to request ADB assistance to develop a transport sector \nstrategy. Based on discussion with various stakeholders, the three focus areas expected to \ndrive national economic growth in the next 10 to 15 years are international trade, transit, and \ntourism\u2014all of which are dependent on an efficient and developed transport system. Therefore, \nit is essential to develop transport infrastructure and provide an enabling environment to achieve \neconomic growth.  \n \n10.  Since 1996, ADB has provided support for lending and nonlending activities in the \ntransport sector,  including  project   preparatory  TA  studies, and TA studies  for  policy  reform   \n \n ", "      3 \nin  the road and railway sector.3 Other development partners are also assisting the transport \nsector  in  Uzbekistan,  including  the  World  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation \n(JBIC), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and European Union \n(EU). The World Bank has financed the Urban Transport Project, which aims to develop efficient \nand sustainable urban passenger transport services in Almalyk, Bukhara, Namangan, Nukus, \nand  Samarkand.    JBIC  has  financed  the  Railway  Passenger  Transportation  Improvement \nProject, which set up repair facilities for passenger coaches and supplied new coaches to \nUzbekistan Railways (UTY). A second JBIC project is setting up repair facilities for electric \nlocomotives.  The  EU-funded  Europe-Caucasus-Asia  Transport  Corridor  program  has \nundertaken a study of railway electrification, telecommunications, and management information \nsystems. EBRD has financed procurement of electric locomotives and the modernization of \ndiesel electric locomotives.4 ADB worked with EBRD on developing a comprehensive reform \nframework  and  capital  investment  strategy  for  the  railway  sector.  Although  a  number  of \ninvestment projects have been undertaken, no comprehensive sector strategy/assessment has \nbeen carried out for Uzbekistan\u2019s transport sector. The World Bank, EBRD, and JBIC have also \nexpressed support for a comprehensive sector assessment. \n \n11.  The proposed transport sector study would review the current status of the transport \nsector at the national and regional level, and develop short-term (2006\u20132010), medium-term \n(2011\u20132015) and long-term (2016\u20132020) plans for transport sector development in Uzbekistan. \nThe study will examine (i) rural, urban, and intercity transport (national level); and (ii) regional \ncorridors  with  neighboring  countries  and  development  of  the  east-west  and  north-south \ninternational corridors (regional level). The study will analyze the complementarity of different \nmodes of transport and recommend measures to enhance multimodal transport development \nand  freight  forwarding  activity  in  Uzbekistan.  It  will  undertake  or  analyze  (i)  strengths, \nweaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis for each mode; (ii) lessons learned; \nand (iii) international experience in similar economies. These will inform the preparation of an \ninvestment  plan  and  recommendations  for  policy,  institutional,  reform,  legal,  and  other \nmeasures to be adopted by the Government to create an enabling environment for transport \nsector development. A sector road map will be prepared at the end of the study.  \n \n12.  The study will adopt a participatory approach and undertake extensive consultations with \nrelevant stakeholders. Close coordination will be maintained with the World Bank, EBRD, JBIC, \nand other development partners. Two workshops (one at inception and one after the interim \nreport) and a seminar (after the draft final report) will be undertaken to discuss and disseminate \nthe study\u2019s findings. At the end of the study, the final report will be published in Russian and \nEnglish.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997.

The objective of the TA is to assist the Government in preparing a transport sector \nstrategy to improve sector efficiency in order to effectively meet the transportation needs of the \ndomestic economy and international traffic. To achieve this objective, the TA will (i) undertake a \ndetailed assessment of all modes of transport; (ii) identify strategic priorities and resources for \nsector development, and operational needs for the short, medium, and long term in line with \ngovernment  objectives;  and  (iii)  help  prepare  short-term  (2006\u20132010),  medium-term         \n(2011\u20132015), and long-term (2016\u20132020) plans and a sector road map, clearly prioritizing the \nactions to be taken for transport sector development in Uzbekistan. This strategy will serve as \nthe  Government\u2019s  key  document  guiding  policies  and  investment  in  the  transport  sector    \n(2006\u20132020). The TA will support enterprise reforms and restructuring of transport enterprises, \nand  assess  opportunities  for  promoting  good  governance  in  operation  and  procedures  to \nenhance efficiency and achieve financial self-sufficiency in a market environment. The TA will \nguide ADB assistance for lending and nonlending products and services in the transport sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  International consultants, supported by domestic consultants, will be engaged to help the \nGovernment prepare the transport strategy. The TA will be undertaken in close consultation with \nthe  Government,  Uzbek  Association  of  Transport  and  Transport  Communication  (UATTC), \nUzbekistan Temir Yullari (UTY), Uzbekistan Havo Yullari (UHY), and other relevant agencies. It \nwill consider all previous studies by the Government, ADB, other multilateral agencies, and \nbilateral agencies. The TA will involve analytical and innovative research, fieldwork, training, \nand stakeholder consultations with the Government, civil society, private sector, user groups, \nand international development partners. \n \n15.  Key TA activities will include (i) an analytical review of the status of the transport sector \nand  preparation  of  a  transport  sector  update;  (ii)  review  of  development  plans  for  roads, \nrailways,  civil  aviation,  river  transport,  and  urban  transport;  (iii)  identification  of  long-term \ndevelopment needs, policy reforms, and regulatory requirements in line with the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment goals; (iv) extensive consultations with stakeholders, including two workshops \n(one to discuss the inception report and another to discuss the interim report) and a seminar (to \ndiscuss  the  draft  strategy);  (v)  preparation  of  short-term  (2006\u20132010),  medium-term \n(2011\u22122015), and long-term (2016\u20132020) plans and a sector road map for transport sector \ndevelopment in Uzbekistan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $765,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $451,000 and a local currency cost of $314,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to \nfinance $600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $149,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The remaining local currency cost of $165,000 equivalent will be \nprovided by the Government, mainly in kind. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \n ", "      5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  UATTC,  the  coordinating  agency  for  Uzbekistan\u2019s  transport  agencies,  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and  monitoring  TA  activities.  A \nsteering committee\u2014comprising representatives of relevant transport departments and chaired \nby the UATTC chairman\u2014will be set up to oversee implementation, provide guidance and \ndirection, and facilitate coordination and cooperation among the subsectors and stakeholders. \nThe  committee  will  include  representatives  of  agencies  responsible  for  planning  and \ndevelopment of roads, railways, civil aviation, river, and urban transport. Representatives of the \ncabinet, customs, legal department, freight forwarders, and other relevant agencies will also \nattend the steering committee meetings to ensure that all information relevant to the subsector \nis readily available to the consultants. In addition, UATTC will appoint a project coordinator who \nwill  be  responsible  for  coordinating  and  supervising  the  consultants\u2019  day-to-day  work  and \nserving as a liaison between the consultants and other relevant agencies.  \n \n18.  The TA will require 39 person-months of consulting services, comprising 14 person-\nmonths of international and 25 person-months of domestic input to carry out the terms of \nreference  (Appendix  3).  ADB  will  select  and  engage  consultants  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection \nand engagement of domestic consultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method using \nsimplified technical proposal procedures will be followed. The international consultants will have \nexpertise in transport planning; transport economics; technical issues relating to road, rail, air, \nriver and urban transport; institutional and legal issues; logistics; and multimodal transport \ndevelopment. The domestic consultants will have expertise in issues relating to roads, railways, \ncivil aviation, river transport, urban transport, and logistics. The TA is expected to commence in \nDecember 2005 and be completed by September 2006. Procurement of equipment, supplies, \nand materials by consultants under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The \nequipment will be turned over to UATTC after TA completion.   \n \n19.  To facilitate the work of the consultants and ensure that UATTC benefits from their \nexperience,  the  consultants  will  work  closely  with  counterpart  staff  from  UATTC  and \nrepresentatives from the line agencies with relevant work experience. The Government has \nagreed that counterpart staff will be provided in a timely manner. \n \n20.  The consultants will submit an inception report within 3 weeks of starting work as well as \nbrief monthly progress reports. The consultants will interact on a regular basis with relevant \ntransport agencies and other interested government organizations concerning the techniques, \nanalysis, and findings of the TA. The consultants will submit an interim report within 3 months \nand a draft final report within 6 months of starting work. The draft final report will be reviewed by \nthe Government and ADB and the comments will be finalized at a final tripartite meeting (among \nthe Government, UATTC, TA consultants, and ADB) to be held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The \nconsultants will submit a final report within 3 weeks of receipt of comments from UATTC and \nADB. Two workshops and one seminar will be organized to discuss the inception report, interim \nreport, and draft final report at Tashkent. Comments from these meetings will be taken into \naccount when finalizing the report. The final report will be published in Russian and English. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.
