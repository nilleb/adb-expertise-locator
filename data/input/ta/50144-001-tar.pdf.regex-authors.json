INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program\u2019s  strategic \nframework  for  2011\u20132020  (CAREC  2020)  has  two  strategic  objectives:  expand  trade  and \nimprove industrial competitiveness.1 Trade facilitation is one of four priority areas within the \nCAREC 2020 strategic framework. Work in this area is guided by the Transport and Trade \nFacilitation Strategy 2020,2 which focuses on the development of six CAREC corridors through \ninfrastructure investments and trade facilitation initiatives to improve the movement of goods \nand people through and across these corridors. This technical assistance (TA) will support the \ncontinuation of customs reforms and modernization efforts undertaken by CAREC countries. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \n2.  Customs cooperation has been a major part of CAREC trade facilitation efforts since the \nregional group was established in 2001. Integrated trade facilitation also promotes efficient \nregional trade logistics development and supports the development of priority trade corridors, \nsingle-window  facilities,  enhanced  interagency  cooperation  and  private  sector  participation, \nimprovement of sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and capacity building. \n \n3.  The trade facilitation program is implemented through two coordinating bodies: (i) the \nCustoms Cooperation Committee (CCC), which comprises heads of customs administrations of \nall CAREC countries and provides a regional forum for discussing issues of common interest; \nand (ii) the CAREC Federation of Carrier and Forwarder Associations (CFCFA), which is a \nprivate nonprofit organization.4 CFCFA\u2019s major objectives are to facilitate transport, trade, and \nlogistics  development  in  the  region,  and  to  advance  the  interests  of  road  carrier,  freight \nforwarder,  and  logistics  service  provider  association  members.  CFCFA  has    22  member \nassociations. \n \n4.  The CCC has five priority work areas: (i) simplification and harmonization of customs \nprocedures and documentation, (ii) information and communication technology for customs \nmodernization and data exchange, (iii) risk management and post-entry audit, (iv) joint customs \ncontrol (JCC), and (v) regional transit facilitation. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports \nthe five priority areas of customs cooperation through regional TA.5 This support has helped \nCAREC  member  countries  make  important  progress  in  customs  modernization  and  trade \nfacilitation within the priority areas. \n \n5.  ADB  assistance  has  significantly  enhanced  trade  facilitation  in  CAREC  countries. \nHowever, it is necessary to continue and deepen customs modernization and trade facilitation \nreforms. \n \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 June 2016. \n4  The organization was established in 2009 under ADB financing (ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Central Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation:  Working  with  the  Private  Sector  in  Trade  Facilitation.  Manila)  as  a \nnongovernment and nonprofit organization, and incorporated as a limited company in 2012. \n5  ADB. 2013.

Technical \nAssistance for the Facilitation of Regional Transit Trade in Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation. Manila. \n ", "2 \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  The simplification and harmonization of customs procedures is based largely on the \nlegal framework that regulates customs operations in each country. Five CAREC countries have \nacceded to the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs \nProcedures or the revised Kyoto Convention (RKC).6 The regional TA on Aligning Customs \nTrade Facilitation Measures with Best Practices in CAREC (footnote 5) supported the conduct \nof  situation  and  gap  analyses  and  the  development  of  a  road  map  for  RKC  accession. \nAmendments and further revisions to laws to conform to the RKC are needed. \n \n7.  ADB support helped to develop a framework for an information exchange mechanism to \nenable the electronic exchange of data between customs administrations to promote real-time \ncollaboration. The mechanism needs to be piloted in two or three countries and subsequently \nimplemented throughout the region. \n \n8.  ADB  support  helped  to  assess  risk  management  practices  in  selected  countries  to \ndetermine  what  upgrades  are  needed  to  expedite  clearance.  In  addition,  ADB  supported \nauthorized economic operator (AEO) programs, which Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia \nare now starting to implement. \n \n9.  The JCC pilots between the People\u2019s Republic of China and Mongolia were analyzed \nand a case study developed, which documents success factors and provides guidelines that can \nbe used by other CAREC countries in identifying border-crossing points (BCPs) suitable for pilot \nJCCs.7 It is important to continue expanding the JCC pilots and to test phases 2 and 3 of the \nJCC approach.8 \n \n10.  The TA on the Facilitation of Regional Transit Trade in CAREC aims to improve the \ntreatment of transit traffic across CAREC by developing a regional transit guarantee mechanism \n(footnote 5). The TA undertook a detailed assessment of transit traffic flows in all CAREC \ncountries  and  identified  priority  corridors;  it  is  recommended  that  the  customs  guarantee \nmechanism is piloted in a CAREC corridor  as a test of improved transit traffic.9 \n \n11.  Time-release studies (TRSs) and corridor performance measurement and monitoring \n(CPMM)  are  essential  in  assessing  the  performance  and  efficiency  of  the  six  CAREC \ncorridors.10 CPMM collects data on the time and cost of moving freight within the CAREC region, \nparticularly  at  BCPs.  TRSs  measure  relevant  aspects  of  the  effectiveness  of  operational \nprocedures that are carried out by customs and other regulatory agencies in the standard \nprocessing of exports and imports, and in transit movements. More effort is needed to expand \n                                                \n6  World  Customs  Organization.  The  Revised  Kyoto  Convention.  http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/facilitation/ \ninstrument-and-tools/conventions/pf_revised_kyoto_conv.aspx. The five CAREC countries that have acceded to \nthe RKC are Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Pakistan. \n7  The case study covers the pilot sites of Zamiin-Uud (Mongolia) and Erlian (People\u2019s Republic of China) BCP, and \nGashuun Sukhait (Mongolia) and Ganqimaodao (People\u2019s Republic of China) BCP. The case study outlines \nsuccess factors and challenges in the use of unified cargo manifests. \n8  All JCCs currently supported under the CAREC Program are in the first phase of implementation, i.e., document \nharmonization through the unified cargo manifest aimed at electronic exchange. Phase 2 will involve mutual \nrecognition of inspection results, while phase 3 will involve joint border inspections. \n9  A consultation with CCC members on 21 April 2016 focused on the mechanics of the regional transit guarantee \nmechanism; next steps include implementing the pilot scheme and the results of the legal and regulatory analyses. \nThe pilot corridor is expected to be formally approved at the annual CCC meeting in August 2016. \n10  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nthe use of and capacity to implement periodic TRSs in CAREC countries so that progress on \nimproving border procedures can be monitored and information obtained on which to base \nreforms and modernization. CPMM data can aid customs officials in implementing TRSs and \ndocumenting their contribution to improved corridor performance. \n \n12.  Furthermore, an integrated approach to addressing border and beyond-border issues\u2014\none  that  involves  both  the  government  and  the  private  sector\u2014can  help  ensure  solutions \nendure. In recent meetings with the CCC, CFCFA highlighted the increased costs and lengthy \ndelays at CAREC corridors and BCPs due to inconsistent, repetitive, and unclear procedures, \nand the lack of coordination among border management agencies. At the first joint meeting of \nthe CCC and CFCFA in August 2015, both CFCFA and policy makers agreed to build more \neffective communication channels, conduct joint research and capacity building activities in \ncommon areas of interest, and support pilot initiatives for trade facilitation. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n13.  The TA  will  support  the  continuation  of  customs reforms  and modernization  efforts \nundertaken by CAREC countries in the framework of the CCC. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the TA will be improved flow of goods and people within the CAREC \nregion. The outcome will be improved trade facilitation in CAREC countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the delivery of two outputs \nand their associated activities. \n \n16.  Output 1: Trade facilitation measures strengthened. Further strengthening of the \nCCC will solidify achievements gained and stimulate faster adoption of new technologies, tools, \nand best practices. To advance the trade facilitation program, the CCC agreed to implement \nspecific initiatives in support of the following outputs: \n(i)  Revised  Kyoto  Convention  accession  documents  completed.  Capacity \ndevelopment  TA  will  be  provided  to  (a)  complete  the  submission  process, \nincluding introducing regulatory reforms in compliance with RKC provisions; and \n(b)  support  countries  that  are  starting  accession  to  raise  awareness  among \ndecision makers regarding the benefits and advantages of accession, and build \nsupport for accession. \n(ii)  Customs  information  exchange  mechanism  pilot-tested.  This  will  involve \ntesting options based on the framework of the customs information exchange \nmechanism and progressing to a pilot stage of implementation. \n(iii)  Preparatory work for joint customs control pilots undertaken. Support will \nbe provided to expand JCC to additional CAREC BCP pairs in other countries \nand advance existing pilots to phase 2 (mutual recognition of inspection results \nand exchange of scanned images), based on lessons from the JCC case study. \n(iv)  Periodic time-release studies conducted. Technical support will be provided \nfor the conduct of TRSs on a regular basis to enable customs to accurately \nmeasure operational procedures. This will help ensure that related decisions to \nimprove performance are well conceived and carried out. \n \n ", "4 \n17.  Output  2:  Trade  facilitation  measures  through  enhanced  cooperation  with  the \nprivate  sector  implemented. CFCFA and customs authorities have agreed to build more \neffective communication channels, conduct joint research and capacity building activities in \ncommon areas of interest, and support pilot initiatives for trade facilitation. TA will be provided to \nrealize the following: \n(i)  Regional  transit  scheme  piloted  in  a  corridor.  The  TA  will  support  the \nimplementation of a pilot regional transit regime for a specific CAREC region \ncorridor.  \n(ii)  Risk management systems upgraded. Advisory support will be provided to \nstrengthen customs risk management systems and implementation of the SAFE \nFramework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade of the World \nCustoms Organization (WCO), including the adoption of the AEO concept;11 and \nto  enhance  private  sector  participation  in  AEO  implementation  through  the \nprovision of detailed risk data on traders, carriers, and forwarders. \n(iii)  Trade logistics documents standardized. The TA will support CFCFA efforts \nto adopt International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations standards \nthrough training programs and consultations to establish a uniform standard for \nfreight forwarders. \n(iv)  Use  of  corridor  performance  measurement  and  monitoring  and  time-\nrelease study results streamlined. The TA will (a) support the use of both \nCPMM  and  TRS  methodologies  to  validate,  enrich,  and  refine  results  and \nfindings so that regulatory authorities can identify causes of delays and formulate \nappropriate corrective actions; and (b) collaborate with the CAREC Institute to \nsupport  national  agencies  and  academic  institutions  to  use  CPMM  data  for \nnational-level  analysis  to  support  better-informed  investment  decisions  to \nimprove border management. \n(v)  Joint  capacity  building  and  research  activities  conducted.  Joint  training \nprograms, seminars, workshops, and consultation meetings will be conducted, as \nwell as research in areas of common interest. ADB will cooperate with the WCO \nand the CAREC Institute in the delivery of capacity building activities where \npossible. \n \n18.  The assumptions and risks of the TA implementation are that (i) any changes in customs \nleadership across the region will not break the continuity of these regional efforts and trade \nfacilitation  activities,  (ii)  joint  activities  will  continue  to  be  done  in  close  cooperation  with \ngovernment and customs officials and private sector operators, and (iii) support for collective \naction on technical matters of the trade facilitation program will remain strong. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $750,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.12 \n \n                                                \n11 World Customs Organization. 2015.

ADB will be the executing agency.13 The Public Management, Financial Sector, and \nRegional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will serve as the focal point and \nadminister the TA in coordination with the CAREC unit of the Central and West Asia Department, \nthe resident missions in CAREC countries concerned, and the CAREC Institute. The 2-year \nimplementation period will be from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2018. \n \n21.  TA  progress  will  be  monitored  against  intended  outcomes,  outputs,  indicators,  and \ntargets  provided  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  Experience  and \nknowledge gained through the TA will be widely disseminated through knowledge products, \nsuch as strategic publications, policy and strategy papers, and conferences. TA reports will be \nmade  available  on  the  ADB  website  and  published  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy 2011. \n \n22.  The TA will require 12 person-months of intermittent international consulting services \nand 24 person-months of intermittent national consulting services. Consultants and resource \npersons will be specialists in the areas of customs reform, customs law, trade facilitation, and \nregional cooperation. In view of the TA project\u2019s diverse activities, consultants and resource \npersons will be selected on an individual basis. The consultants will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The \noutline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n23.  TA implementation will require close coordination with the WCO, which will provide \ntechnical experts to conduct training programs and seminars on specialized customs topics. \nConsequently, there is a provision for international travel and per diem of resource persons. In \naddition, the TA will support extensive consultations and workshops to implement the proposed \npilot schemes, conduct specialized joint training for customs and other border management \nagencies with the participation of private sector stakeholders, and support CCC and CFCFA \nmeetings. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Implementation  of  Trade  Facilitation  Initiatives  in  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n13 ADB will not undertake any activities in the relevant developing member country until a written no objection is \nobtained. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nSmooth flow of goods and people within the CAREC region improved (CAREC Transport and Trade \nFacilitation Strategy 2020)a \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nTrade facilitation  By 2019  a.
