It is \nformulated  as  a  sector  loan  project,  requiring  the  towns  to \ndemonstrate their commitment to the Project and the associated \nreforms, thus encouraging a demand-led approach. The Project \nblends environmental and livelihood improvements with reforms \nfor establishing and developing decentralized urban governance \nin small towns. Physical investments that include improvements \nto roads, drainage, sanitation and solid waste management, and \nvillage upgrading are combined with civic awareness programs \nand  inclusive  processes  to  obtain  maximum  and  sustainable \nbenefits from investments and to ensure effective targeting of the \npoor.  \n   \nRationale        Over the last 6 years, the urban environment in the Lao PDR has \nimproved significantly with investments in Vientiane and the four \nsecondary towns. However, a focus on the largest urban centers \nconstrained  the  ability  of  the  urban  sector  to  realize  its  full \npotential  to  support  equitable  and  broad-based  development. \nSmall towns have not benefited from the investments. This fact \nhas not only impoverished the small towns\u2019 residents, but also \nundermined  the  developmental  roles  of  these  towns  as  (i) \nprovincial  and  district  centers;  (ii)  centers  of  marketing  and \nagricultural processing in the rural hinterland and economic links \nbetween rural, national, and international markets; and (iii) places \noffering nonfarm employment to the rural poor who are mostly \nengaged  in  livelihoods  that  depend  on  natural  resources, \nthreatening the country\u2019s ecological sustainability. At this stage of \nurban development in the Lao PDR, when Vientiane and the \nsecondary  towns  have  already  developed  as  national  and \nregional centers, the focus of development effort needs to shift to \nsmall urban centers to support broad-based development and \nreduce poverty within both urban and rural communities. There is \na need to improve basic infrastructure and services to attain a \nreasonable  quality  of  life  for  the  towns\u2019  people.  Physical \ninvestments need to be combined with livelihood improvements. \nImprovements should follow inclusive processes to respond to \ncommunity needs and catalyze the resources of the poor. All ", "iv  \nthese interventions must be supported by extending the reforms \nfor decentralized urban governance to the small towns.  \n  \nObjectives        The Project aims to improve the quality of life and to enhance \nproductivity in selected small urban centers that play or have the \npotential  to  play  an  important  role  as  market,  services,  and \nmanufacturing  centers  supporting  the  rural  hinterland.  The \nspecific objectives are to (i) improve the living conditions of the \nsmall towns\u2019 communities, especially the poor, by improving the \nurban  environment,  increasing  access  to  essential  urban \ninfrastructure and services, and enhancing livelihoods; and (ii) \nsupport the establishment and development of decentralized and \ndedicated institutional and management frameworks for effective, \nresponsive, and sustainable provision of urban infrastructure and \nservices  in  small  towns.  Improvements  in  these  towns  are \nexpected to have spin-off benefits for the rural population and \neconomy that have symbiotic relationship with these towns. The \nproject  components  are  grouped  into  two:  part  A  -  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  improvements  and  part  B  - \nimplementation support and capacity building. Part A includes (i) \ntownwide infrastructure and amenities; comprising investments \nin  major  roads,  drainage,  public  markets,  and  bus  station \nenvironments; (ii) town cleanliness/environmental services, i.e., \nimproving solid waste and sanitation management services; and \n(iii) village upgrading and livelihood promotion, combining village \ninfrastructure  and  services  improvements  with  livelihood \nenhancement,  and  following  a  demand-responsive  and \npartnership approach with villages playing a major role in the \nprocess.  Part  B  provides  for  consulting  services  and  other \nnecessary inputs to support (i) implementation of infrastructure \nand services under part A, (ii) civic awareness and community \ndialogue  processes  to  maximize  the  benefits  from  physical \ninvestments and to  ensure sustainability of the project impacts, \nand (iii) establishment of and capacity building for decentralized \nurban-focused entities in the project towns.   \n    \nCost Estimates      The project cost is estimated at $20.0 million equivalent, of which \n$9.7  million  is  the  foreign  currency  cost  and  $10.3  million \nequivalent is the local currency cost. \n \nFinancing Plan                                                ($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  9.7  6.3  16.0  80 \nGovernment   0.0  3.8  3.8  19 \nCommunity  0.0  0.2  0.2  1 \nTotal  9.7  10.3  20.0  100 \n ", "  v\nLoan Amount and Terms    A  loan  in  the  amount  of  SDR  12,123,000  ($16.0  million \nequivalent) in various currencies from the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB's) Special Funds resources will be provided for a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter. \n \nRelending Terms      The urban development administration authorities (UDAAs) in ten \nproject  towns  will  contribute  $1.6  million  to  the  project  cost \nthrough  subloans  from  the  Government  using  the  ADB  loan \nproceeds. The subloan will have an interest rate of 6.7% per \nannum and a repayment period of 15 years following completion \nof the Project, including an initial grace period of 3 years. The \nGovernment  and  UDAAs  will  enter  into  subsidiary  loan \nagreements. UDAA financing will cover the cost of vehicle and \nequipment  for  the  solid  waste  and  sanitation  management \nimprovements in small towns. \n \nPeriod of Utilization     Until July 2009 \n \nEstimated Completion Date    31 January 2009 \n \nExecuting Agency      The  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the  Ministry  of \nCommunication, Transport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC). A \nnational project steering committee to be chaired by the vice \nminister of MCTPC and with representatives from the Ministry of \nFinance, the Committee for Planning and Cooperation, the Prime \nMinister's  office,  Bank  of  Lao  PDR,  UDAAs,  and  provincial \ngovernments concerned will be formed to oversee the Project. \nProvincial project facilitating committees will also be formed in \neach  town  to  support  UDAAs  in  their  endeavor  to  gradually \ntransform themselves into competent urban authorities.   \n \nImplementation Arrangements  A  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  be  established  in  the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Planning of MCTPC. Headed \nby a national project director, the PCU will be responsible for \noverall  execution  and  planning  of  project  implementation, \nprogramming, budgeting, and financial planning and accounting. \nUDAAs  to  be  established  in  each  project  town  will  be  the \nImplementing Agencies (IAs) except for the livelihood promotion \nsubcomponent. Project implementation units (PIUs) to be located \nin  UDAAs  will  be  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation, including subproject preparation, detailed design, \nprocurement of goods and services under all local competitive \nbidding (LCB) packages, planning and implementing the village \nupgrading  component,  and  civic  awareness,  community \ndialogue, and partnering activities. For the livelihood promotion \nsubcomponent, suitably qualified microfinance institutions to be \nidentified according to the agreed-upon criteria, will be the IA and \nwill  closely  coordinate  with  UDAAs,  especially  on  social ", "vi  \nintermediation activities. Villages will play a major role in planning, \nimplementing,  and  operating  and  maintaining  the  village \nupgrading  subcomponent.  To  use  project  implementation  to \ntransfer knowledge and skills to the newly established UDAAs, \nthe project management and implementation activities will as \nmuch as possible be delegated to PIUs where the majority of the \nconsultants  and  counterpart  staff  are  located,  and  with  PCU \nhaving  a  core  unit  with  mainly  coordinating  and  facilitating \nfunctions.   \n \nProcurement       ADB-financed goods and works will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  procedures  will  be  used  for  major  civil  works \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  over  $1.0  million  and  supply \ncontracts valued over  $500,000. For civil works contracts not \nexceeding $1.0 million, LCB procedures will be used. For supply \ncontracts  valued  $500,000  or  lower,  international  shopping \nprocedures will be followed. The PCU will handle procurement \nthrough  ICB  and  international  shopping.  Procurement  through \nLCB will be initiated by UDAA, and be ratified by a bid evaluation \ncommittee to be chaired by UDAA and with representatives from \nprovincial and district offices. Through PCU, the documents will \nbe sent to ADB for review. The package of works per village is \nrelatively small at about $30,000. The works are labor intensive \nand  do  not  require  sophisticated  technologies. Therefore, for \nworks  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $10,000  and  where  the \ncapacity of the community to undertake the works is adequate, \ncommunity participation in procurement will be applied.  \n  \nConsulting Services       Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  A  team  of  consultants  with  a  total  input  of  661 \nperson-months (77 international and 584 domestic) will assist the \nPCU  and  PIUs  in  three  major  areas:  (i)  overall  project \nmanagement and implementation; (ii) implementing the program \nof  activities  for  civic  awareness,  community  dialogue  and \npartnering; and (iii) capacity building for UDAAs. \n \nProject Benefits  The Project will benefit about 143,000 residents in small towns \nand Beneficiaries  through an improved urban environment that will have a direct \nimpact  on  the  health  and  living  conditions  of  the  towns\u2019 \ncommunities.  The  economy  will  benefit  from  enhanced \nproductivity as a result of health improvements as well as from \nincreased  urban  efficiency  resulting  from  improved  roads, \ndrainage,  and  markets.  All  project  interventions  will  either \ndirectly or indirectly benefit the poor. About 43,000 urban poor or \n 30%  of the population will benefit from better roads that will ", "  vii\n  enhance  the  poor\u2019s  mobility  and  access  to  income-earning \nopportunities.  Drainage  improvements  will  have  a  profound \nimpact on the poor, most of whom live on low-lying flood-prone \nland.  Improved  solid  waste  management  and  sanitation  will \nreduce the frequency of illness among the urban poor. About 60 \nvillages with higher levels of poverty will benefit from village \nupgrading,  providing  70,000  residents  with  access  roads, \nfootpaths,  and  better  drainage.  Microfinance  services  in  the \nlivelihood promotion subcomponent will benefit an estimated \n8,500 urban poor. Moreover, an estimated 127,000 rural poor \nwill indirectly benefit from improved (i) road conditions allowing \nbetter access to urban markets and marketing knowledge and \n(ii) environment in small towns with which the rural poor has \nsymbiotic relationships.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major potential risks include those related to (i) reforms for \ndecentralized  urban  governance,  (ii)  sustainability  of  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  small  towns  in  general  and \nproject facilities in particular, and (iii) community attitudes. To \nmitigate these risks the Project has devised a strategy which \ninvolves (i) an urban policy and reform agenda and associated \nassurances agreed to by the Government as safeguards for \nmitigating risks for reforms; (ii) a capacity building component \ndevoted  to  help  UDAAs  in  developing  their  technical  and \nfinancial capacities and the cost recovery measures to sustain \nthe infrastructure and services created; (iii) specific measures \nof the sector lending approach requiring the towns\u2019 commitment \nto UDAA reforms before inclusion in the Project; and (iv) an \nextensive program of civic awareness and community dialogue, \nwhich  will  motivate  the  communities  to  participate  in  and \ncontribute to improvements. \n \n \n \n ", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Small Towns Development Sector \nProject.1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The Lao PDR is essentially a rural country with about 18% of the total population (0.85 \nmillion) living in urban areas. However, since the mid 1980s, as a result of economic liberalization \nand expanded commercial and industrial opportunities in urban areas, growing numbers of rural \npeople have been drawn to the urban areas in search of better livelihoods. Although the economy \nis still largely rural, the role of the urban sector is growing. During 1997 to 2001, the industry and \nservices sector components of the gross domestic product increased at average annual rates of 8 \nand 6.2%, compared with 5.3% for agriculture, implying the higher productivity and greater \nopportunities  in  urban  areas. Vientiane, the capital city, is the largest urban center with a \npopulation of about 200,000. The four largest provincial capitals are called secondary towns, with \npopulations of 20,000 to 60,000. An emerging category of urban settlements is the small towns2 \nwith populations ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 and annual growth rates of up to 4.3%. These \ntowns perform critical administrative functions as provincial and district capitals, and are the \neconomic links between the rural areas and the national and international markets. They are the \ncenters  of  immediate  markets,  transport  depots,  and  agricultural  processing  in  the  rural \nhinterland. Large numbers3 of rural people commute daily to the towns to exchange their rural \nproduce with urban goods and services. The towns offer the rural poor labor markets during off-\nfarm seasons. The nonfarm employment in the towns presents a viable alternative for the country \nwhere ecological sustainability is threatened by livelihoods4 dependent on natural resources.  \n \n3.  Over the last 6 years, the urban environment in the Lao PDR has improved significantly \nwith investments in Vientiane and the four largest secondary towns. However, a focus on the \nlargest urban centers compromised the ability of the urban sector to realize its full potential to \nsupport equitable and broad-based development. The quality of life and urban productivity in \nsmall  towns  and  the  potential  developmental  role  that  small  towns  can  play  in  their  rural \nhinterland are constrained by the grossly inadequate urban infrastructure and services that are \nthe focus of this Project. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n4.  The towns vary widely in the quality and coverage of urban infrastructure and services. \nNone has a central or partial sewerage system, and existing on-site sanitation systems are in \npoor condition because there are no septic waste collection or treatment systems. The absence \nof interconnected drainage networks results in frequent flooding after rainstorms. The percentage \nof lined primary and secondary drainage networks varies from 0 to 40%. Water in the roadside \ndrains is contaminated with fecal matter from on-site sanitation systems. Drainage, where it \nexists, becomes blocked with silt washed from the unpaved roads during the  rainy season. \nGenerally, only the main roads are surfaced, but they are often in bad condition. Other roads, \ngenerally gravel or earth, are invariably dusty during dry season and muddy in rainy periods. \n                                                 \n1   The project preparatory technical assistance was approved in August 2000. ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Small Towns Development Project. Manila.   \n2   There are about 23 towns in this category. However, the distinction between small towns and secondary towns are \nnot clear-cut as some of them have equal administrative importance and higher potential for future growth. \n3   About 1000 to 1500 people from the surrounding and adjacent rural districts visit these towns on a daily basis.   \n4   The Government goals are to stop poppy cultivation by 2005 and shifting cultivation by 2010.  ", "2  \nMaintenance for urban roads and drainage is irregular and lacks necessary funding and clear \narrangements. Solid waste management services are inadequate with no regular collection. \nExcept one town, Xam Neua, the coverage of solid waste collection is no more than 12%.  None \nof the towns have a sanitary or controlled solid waste disposal site. Town markets, where the \neconomic activity revolves around and where the poor can sell their produce and offer their \nservices as porters and cleaners, are in poor hygienic conditions, lacking ventilation, lighting, \nsurfacing, sanitation, and parking areas. The health and productivity of the population in these \nsmall urban centers are constantly undermined by poor environmental conditions.   \n    \n5.  Tertiary infrastructure at the urban village level is also inadequate with a directly adverse \nimpact on the quality of life of the village communities, especially the poor. Access is generally \npoor characterized by earthen and undrained pavements that become quagmires in the wet \nseason. The conditions are worse in the poorer villages. While there are no large aggregate poor \ncommunities in these towns, poverty is dispersed throughout the urban villages, with some \nvillages accommodating much larger populations of the poor than others. Frequently, a few poor \nfamilies huddle behind the homes of wealthier villagers. The poor live on undeveloped plots \nwithout street frontage or proper access roads. The plots are often poorly drained and prone to \nflooding. Conditions are unhygienic, water- and feces-borne diseases are prevalent, undermining \nthe health and income-earning ability of the poor. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the \ncommunities generally are not aware of the links between health and environmental conditions. \nLack  of  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services  in  small  towns  is  both  a  cause  and \nconsequence of poverty. The level of urban infrastructure and services in small towns and the \ninvestment requirements are presented in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  Poverty incidence5 in small towns varies from 18 to 43% in line with the regional variations \nin poverty incidence in the Lao PDR. The majority of the towns are in the Northern region where \nthe poverty incidence is highest. As a result, poverty incidence in the project towns is estimated at \n30%. A poverty assessment conducted as part of the feasibility study suggests that the most \ncommonly expressed cause of poverty is lack of a permanent occupation, and consequently, a \nlow and irregular income. In most cases, physical and social exclusion act together, resulting in a \nperpetual poverty cycle of poor access to basic infrastructure and services, poor health, low \nproductivity, and low incomes of the poor. The poorest of the poor6 depend on markets as their \nmain source of income, where they sell vegetables and forest products, or offer their labor as \nporters and cleaners. The vast majority of the middle- and upper-poor groups7 are engaged in \nmarket vending, home-based micro-enterprise, and small retail activities. Existing and potential \nmicroentrepreneurs, however, are constrained by lack of access to institutional microfinance and \nassociated services. Small loans needed by these groups are not available through the existing \nbanking system. Most households report finance as a major start-up problem in establishing a \nlivelihood.  \n   \n7.  The  inadequate  institutional  frameworks  and  management  capacities  invariably \nexacerbate the poor living conditions and the poor state of infrastructure and services. Currently, \nurban planning and provision of infrastructure and services in these towns are the responsibility of \nthe provincial and district departments of the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Posts, and \nConstruction (MCTPC). These departments, with limited staff and resources and widespread \nresponsibility for both urban and rural areas within their respective provinces and districts, cannot \ncope with the diverse demands of these rapidly growing and densely populated towns that require \n                                                 \n5  This is based on the equivalent income needed to purchase 2,100 calories per person per day plus some \nexpenditure for non-food items; ADB Participatory Poverty Assessment, Lao PDR, 2001. The poverty assessment \nused a comprehensive definition involving quality of life poverty indicators resulting in much lower rates of poverty. \n6  The poorest of the poor has an income of less than $21 per household per month.   \n7   These groups\u2019 incomes vary between $22 and $62 per household per month.  ", "  3 \ndedicated  management.  The  departments  rely  on  the  central  Government  to  provide  and \nmaintain infrastructure. There is little relationship between budget requirements and allocations \nactually  received.  There  is  no  separate  budget  for  maintaining  urban  infrastructure,  and \nmaintenance is severely underfunded. The degree of cost recovery is minimal, with user charges \nin most towns being confined to solid waste collection. In the absence of separate accounts \nmaintained for these services, it is not possible to establish a relationship between the revenues \nand cost of services. The situation is exacerbated by the predominantly rural background of small \ntowns communities who are not accustomed to the benefits of urban services for which they are \nreluctant to pay. The sector analysis is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  The inadequate infrastructure and services and poor environmental conditions in small \ntowns stem from the fact that until recently, small towns had the lowest priority in the country\u2019s \ndevelopment agenda and have benefited least from public investments. The Government is now \nkeen on equitable growth and is concerned with the complementary and supportive role of small \ntowns in broad-based local development. The Fifth Five-Year Socioeconomic Plan (2001-2005) \nprioritizes planning and developing basic infrastructure and services in urban areas, including \nsmall towns. The poverty reduction partnership agreement, signed in September 2001 by ADB \nand the Government, includes small towns development as one of the key operational priorities to \nenhance reciprocal linkages between urban and rural areas, more specifically, (i) integrating rural \nproducers with urban markets, (ii) enabling urban entrepreneurs to trade with rural people, and \n(iii) facilitating access of the rural and urban population to international markets. The Government \nrecognizes that this vision requires interventions to meet basic human needs and stimulate the \neconomy in small towns. The Government\u2019s urban sector investment plan indicates that about \n$97 million is required to meet the investment needs in the next 10 years in the urban areas. This \nfigure includes about $44 million for the needs of all the small towns including further investment \nneeds of the project towns. The capital investment program is ambitious and suggests that the \ninvestment projects need to be prioritized for the optimum use of scarce available resources. The \nlikely sources of financing for urban sector investment needs are given in Appendix 2.    \n \n9.  The incidence of poverty in small towns results from lack of programs that could address \nthe multidimensional nature of poverty. The limited funds in the context of large-scale major \ninfrastructure needs have, so far, not reached the village level where the impact of investments \ncould directly be felt by the communities. While the lack of funds is a constraint on improvement \nprograms, a major problem is lack of effective strategies that could spark the initiatives of the \npoor and mobilize the resources of village communities in improving their environment. The \nrecent Government policy to assign to the villages a greater role in development provides an \nimmense opportunity to promote new approaches whereby village communities can become \nactive partners in the development process of their own villages. However, improving basic \ninfrastructure and services alone will not suffice to make a sustainable impact on the lives of the \npoor. The poverty assessment report clearly highlights the linkage between poor environmental \nconditions and low incomes. It is essential that environmental improvements in small towns be \ncomplemented with interventions to enhance livelihoods and thus sustain the improved living \nconditions of the poor.  \n \n10.  The  poor  living  conditions,  inadequate  infrastructure  and  services,  and  insufficient \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  also  arise  from  the  current  forms  of  centralized  urban \nmanagement  and  limited  institutional  capacities.  The  current  institutional  framework  is  not \nconducive  to  delivering  services  efficiently  and  mobilizing  local revenues. Recognizing the \nlimitations  of  centralized  urban  management  in  an  increasingly  urbanizing  society,  the \nGovernment launched a program of decentralization in 1995. Since then, the Government has ", "4  \ncreated urban development administration authorities (UDAAs) in Vientiane and the four major \nsecondary towns and envisages eventually transforming these authorities into autonomous urban \nlocal governments. With a number of prime ministerial (PM) decrees, decisions, and instructions, \nthese authorities were  recognized as legal entities with exclusive responsibility for planning, \nmanaging, and providing infrastructure and services in urban areas. More importantly, they were \nempowered  to  raise  local  revenues  from  a  range  of  sources  to  increasingly  meet  their \nexpenditure for the urban functions. In its Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Government reconfirms its \ncommitment  to  the  gradual  development  of  municipal  administrations  in  urban  areas  and \nacknowledges the need to extend the decentralization reforms to the small towns.      \n \n11.  The review of past UDAA reforms suggests the need for further concerted efforts to \nmaintain the momentum for reforms. The comprehensive nature of the decentralization reforms \nrequires technical, financial, and legal interventions by a number of agencies at various levels. \nAlthough the PM decrees provide, in the interim, the required legal basis for UDAA operations, \nthe  issue  of  lack  of  an  encompassing  and  permanent  legal  framework  for  urban  local \ngovernments needs to be resolved in the medium term by enacting the local administration bill \nbeing discussed within the Government. A review of the decentralization process also shows that \nthe Government commitments made through a number of PM decrees and decisions have not \nalways been simultaneously supported by other concerned agencies. While the financial and \ntechnical progress of the Vientiane UDAA (VUDAA) was relatively promising, the progress of \nUDAAs in some secondary towns has been constrained, in some cases, by inadequate support \nfrom provincial governments or, in other cases, failure of the concerned line ministries to actually \ntransfer the assets, staff, and revenue collection function to UDAAs. The future urban policy and \ninstitutional reform agenda should take into account the past experience and build on the reforms \nevolving over the last 6 years in the Lao PDR. Further reforms, which have formed the content of \nthe policy dialogue pursued during preparation of the Project, include (i) issuing PM decrees to \nestablish, in small urban centers, UDAAs with mandate to plan and provide urban infrastructure \nand services; (ii) empowering UDAAs to have their own budget and raise local revenues by \nlevying and collecting service charges and fees similar to those being implemented in Vientiane; \nand (iii) supporting capacity building for UDAAs to perform initially as project implementing units \nand to gradually become competent urban entities. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR  is  targeted  at  reducing  poverty  through \nsustainable economic growth, inclusive social development, and good governance. Operational \npriorities  include  strengthening  rural  and  urban  market  linkages,  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement, human resource development, private sector participation, and regional integration. \nUrban and small towns development, whereby (i) rural producers integrate with domestic and \ninternational markets, and (ii) demand on rural natural resources is relieved, is regarded as one of \nthe priority sectors of the country strategy. ADB has been the major development partner in the \nurban sector with five loans for water supply projects amounting to $56 million in and outside \nVientiane and three loans8 targeting urban environmental improvements in Vientiane and the four \nsecondary towns. Along with infrastructure investments, the creation of a legal, institutional, and \nfinancial  framework  for  decentralized  urban  governance  has  been  a  major  thrust  of  ADB\u2019s \nassistance. ADB projects pioneered the creation of UDAAs in Vientiane and the four major \nsecondary towns. Local resource mobilization reforms have been an integral element of UDAA \nreforms to create sustainable sources of income for UDAAs to enable them to perform their \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 1995.

Appendix 3 lists external \nassistance to the sector from ADB and other development partners. \n \n13.  Experience with earlier ADB assistance suggests that institutional reforms require the \nconcerted efforts of all involved parties, and takes a period of time longer than what is envisaged. \nReforms need to be supported by extensive and long-term capacity building. The role of UDAAs \nhas to be clearly understood by provincial and district authorities, which must be involved in the \nprocess. Delayed establishment of UDAAs and their inadequate involvement, from the outset in \nthe secondary towns development project have meant that opportunity to transfer knowledge and \nskills  to  UDAAs  through  the  project  has  been  limited.  Project-specific  lessons  show  that \ncentralized  project  implementation  has  limitations  in  providing  the  towns  with  a  sense  of \nownership and ensuring sustainability of investments. The experience also reveals the need for a \ndemand-responsive approach, requiring the towns\u2019 commitment to the Project, and incorporating \nparticipatory processes to better target the needs of the poor, maximize sustained benefits from \nthe improvements, and solicit community support for the project and UDAA reforms. Lessons \nlearned from earlier ADB assistance are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n14.  At this stage of urban development in the Lao PDR, with Vientiane and the secondary \ntowns having already developed as national and regional centers, the focus of development effort \nneeds to shift to small towns to optimally utilize existing urban potentials to support broad-based \ndevelopment and reduce poverty in the urban and rural communities. There is need to improve \ninfrastructure and services in these towns to attain a reasonable quality of life for the residents, \nespecially the poor. Investments in infrastructure need to be combined with efforts to improve \nlivelihoods through pro-poor microfinance whereby the poor and micro enterprises in the towns \ncan  be  served  on  a  sustainable  basis.  Improvements  should  follow  inclusive  processes  to \nrespond to the community demands and catalyze the resources of urban residents. All these \ninterventions  need  to  be  supported  by  developing  institutional  and  financial  frameworks \nconducive to sustainable urban service delivery through reinforcing and extending the reforms for \ndecentralized urban governance to the small towns.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n15.  The project goal is to  improve the quality of life and to enhance productivity in selected \nsmall urban centers that play or have the potential to play an important role as market, services, \nand manufacturing centers supporting the rural hinterland. The specific objectives are to (i) improve \nthe living conditions of the small towns\u2019 communities, especially the poor, through improved urban \nenvironment,  increased  access  to  essential  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  and  enhanced \nlivelihoods; and (ii) support the establishment and development of decentralized and dedicated \ninstitutional and management frameworks for effective, responsive, and sustainable provision of \nurban infrastructure and services in small towns. Improvements in these towns are expected to \nhave spin off benefits for the rural population and economy that have symbiotic relationship with \nthese towns.  \n \n16.  The Project, which incorporates lessons learned from earlier urban sector assistance, is \ndesigned as a sector loan project. The sector lending mode is considered appropriate as (i) the \n                                                 \n9\n ADB. 1995.

The Project will cover about 10 towns with populations ranging from 8,000 to 20,000. \nFour of the towns10 have already been identified on the basis of agreed-upon criteria, and \nsubprojects prepared for the towns. The remaining towns will be admitted into the Project \nfollowing the same selection criteria. Appendix 4 describes the criteria and procedures for town \nparticipation in the Project and for subproject appraisal.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n17.  The Project components are grouped into two parts: part A: urban infrastructure and \nservices  improvements  and  part  B:  implementation  support  and  capacity  building.    Part  A \nincludes  (i)  townwide  Infrastructure  and  amenities,  (ii)  town  cleanliness  and  environmental \nservices,  and  (iii)  village  upgrading  and  livelihood  promotion.  Part  B  focuses  on  activities \nsupporting  the  implementation  of  infrastructure  improvements,  civic  awareness,  community \ndialogue and partnering processes, and building the capacity of UDAAs in the project towns.      \n \n1.  Urban Infrastructure and Environmental Improvements (Part A) \n \n    a.  Townwide Infrastructure and Amenities  \n \n18.  Townwide infrastructure and amenities include improvements to roads, drainage, public \nmarkets,  and  bus  stations.  Interventions  in  the  roads  subsector  include  rehabilitating  and \nreconstructing  major  town  roads  especially  the  primary  and  secondary  networks of roads, \nsidewalks,  and  bridges;  providing  essential  maintenance  equipment  and  street  lighting. \nInvestments  in  road  improvements  are  supported  by  building  the  capacity  of  UDAAs  for \nmaintenance to ensure that benefits from investments are sustainable.  \n \n19.  Improvements  to  drainage  and  flood  protection  focus  on  constructing  surface  and \nunderground drainage and rehabilitating existing systems, with emphasis on interconnecting \nisolated stretches of channels into a drainage network. Flood protection works are targeted at \nspecific areas where the lives of the poor are adversely affected by flooding. Investments in \ndrainage are supported by providing basic maintenance equipment and improving the systems \nand capacity for maintenance.         \n \n20.  Works related to markets and bus stations aim to improve the environmental conditions \nand public amenities of markets and bus stations. The works include construction of public toilets \nand improvement of surfacing, drainage, public lighting, access roads and footpaths, and small \npassenger vehicle stands. \n \n     b.  Town Cleanliness and Environmental Services  \n \n21.  Town cleanliness and environmental services aim to improve solid waste management \nand sanitation services in small towns. The component is supplemented by a civic awareness \nprogram to stimulate a demand for urban services and to raise the awareness of the communities \non urban cleanliness and environment and health linkages.    \n                                                 \n10 These towns are Ponsavanh, Xam Neua, Vang Vieng, and Paxhanh. Most of the candidate towns in the long list are \nin the northern region that is the geographic focus of ADB Country Strategy and Program for the Lao PDR.  \n ", "  7 \n22.  Improvements  to  solid  waste  management  will  include  provision  of  equipment  and \nvehicles for solid waste collection and disposal, cleaning up of existing and informal dumping \nsites, and construction of controlled landfill sites. New landfill development will be supported if \nsuitable  sites  that  meet  the  environmental  and  resettlement  guidelines  are  identified.  Due \nattention will be paid to the choice of appropriate and affordable technologies in the purchase of \nsolid waste equipment and vehicles and developing controlled landfill sites. An important element \nof the interventions will be establishing effective and sustainable solid waste collection and \ndisposal services by formulating systems, standards, and targets and strengthening the UDAAs. \nMinimizing  the  costs  of  services,  by  eliciting  community  support,  waste minimization, and \naccumulation of waste in village collection points will be major considerations. Where feasible, \nprivatization of waste collection will also be supported.  \n \n23.  Sanitation improvements seek to establish effective septic disposal services in the project \ntowns where pumped and piped collection of wastewater is unaffordable. The improvements \ninclude provision of equipment and vehicles for wastewater collection and transportation, low-cost \nseptic  and  sludge  treatment  facilities,  and  systems  and  capacities  for  effective  septic \nmanagement. Support for privatizing septic disposal services will also form an important aspect of \nthe project assistance.    \n \nc.  Village Upgrading and Livelihood Promotion  \n \n24.   The village upgrading and livelihood promotion component is a demand-responsive and \npro-poor program targeting the poor urban villages. The villages will be selected on the basis of \nagreed-upon criteria. The major considerations in selecting villages will be the higher levels of \npoverty and willingness of the village communities to be active partners in the program and to \ncontribute  financially  or  in  kind  for  improvements.  The  program  aims  to  address  the \nmultidimensional nature of poverty by combining basic infrastructure and service improvements \nwith livelihood promotion that the poor in small towns have unanimously prioritized. Village \ninfrastructure and service improvements seek to improve the poor environmental conditions in \nvillages that have an immediate impact on the quality of life of the communities. The program of \nimprovements will be developed with and by the village communities. Improvements in each \nvillage  will  likely  include  improved  access  roads,  surface  drainage,  solid  waste  collection, \norganizing  village  contracts,  and  encouraging  communities  to  participate  in  village  waste \nmanagement activities and on-site sanitation improvements. Where improvements will serve \nindividual or small groups of beneficiaries, a process of additional individual contribution will be \nfollowed.  The  community-led  village  upgrading  processes  are  described  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \n \n25.  The livelihood promotion component recognizes the links between inadequate access of \nthe poor to basic services and low incomes. Interventions for livelihood promotion will include (i) \nsocial intermediation, (ii) capacity building support to sustainable and pro-poor microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) in the project towns, and (iii) a credit line for microfinance loans. Social \nintermediation will support the demand side of microfinance services by involving the poor in \nsocial mobilization and orientation activities to facilitate their access to and productive use of \nmicrofinance  services.  The  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and,  wherever  possible,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), will be utilized as facilitators in social intermediation. Livelihood promotion \nwill also provide a credit line to suitably qualified MFIs to be selected according to the agreed-\nupon eligibility criteria. The credit line will serve an estimated 1,500 poor households with loans of \n$200-$300 to enable them to develop viable livelihood enterprises through acquired productive \nassets or working capital. Further, the component will support capacity building for the selected \nMFIs  in  the  project  towns.  The  livelihood  promotion  component  is  described  in  detail  in \nSupplementary Appendix C.      ", "8  \n \n26.  The village upgrading and livelihood promotion program assigns a major role to villages \nand relies on village organizations and communities in  planning, constructing, operating, and \nmaintaining village infrastructure and services. The component will therefore be supported by an \nextensive civic awareness and community-partnering program, comprising (i) a program for \nraising awareness on the relationship between public health and the environment, and (ii) building \nthe capacity of village organizations, communities, and UDAAs for community-based village \nplanning and service delivery.  \n \n2.  Support  for  Project  Implementation,  Community  Processes,  and  Capacity \nBuilding (Part B) \n   \na.  Support for Project Management and Implementation  \n \n27.  Support for project management and implementation provides for all the costs related to \nproject management and implementation, including incremental administration and operations of \nproject  management  and  implementation  units,  equipment,  logistics,  and  provisions  for \nconsultancy inputs to assist in implementing the urban infrastructure and services component.   \n \nb.  Civic Awareness, Community Dialogue, and Partnering \n \n28.  Civic  awareness,  community  dialogue,  and  partnering  form  an  umbrella  program \nsupporting all physical improvements and the livelihood promotion component under the Project. \nConsulting and NGO services, training, orientation programs, public campaigns, equipment, and \npromotion materials will be provided to help carry out civic awareness, community dialogue, and \npartnering  activities.  The  program  entails  three  major  interrelated  activities  vital  to  the \nachievement of physical improvements and sustainable project impacts. \n \n29.  Civic  awareness  activities  will  focus  on  stimulating  a  demand  for  improved  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  and  eliciting  the  cooperation  of  town  residents  for  successful \nimplementation of the Project. The activities will involve (i) disseminating information on the scope \nand  nature  of  the  Project,  (ii)  educating  the  towns\u2019  people  on  the  linkages  between  the \nenvironment  and  health  and  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from  the  project  interventions,  (iii) \ninforming the residents of their role and responsibility for good environmental practices for solid \nwaste and septic management, and (iv) raising the residents\u2019 awareness of the cost implications \nof  improved  services.  Cooperation  with  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  other relevant \nprograms of Nam Saat \u2013 National Center for Environmental Health and Water Supply \u2013 will be \nmaintained, where possible, to utilize the existing experience and promotion materials.     \n \n30.  Community dialogue activities will involve the towns\u2019 people at each stage of the townwide \nimprovements, including towns\u2019 subproject preparation, detailed design, construction process, \nand follow-up monitoring activities. A participation strategy will be developed and implemented to \ngenerate periodic feedback from the stakeholders.  \n \n31.   Community partnering will target the village communities to become active partners in \ncommunity-led village upgrading programs. It will build the capacity of village organizations and \ncommunities in participatory village planning and decision making to prioritize works, choose \ndesigns, participate in procurement, O&M, and monitoring and evaluation activities. It will assist \nthe villages in establishing village working committees, cost-sharing mechanisms, and training \nvillage leaders and key persons including women members as well as UDAA staff.                \n \n ", "  9 \nc.  Capacity Building for UDAAs  \n \n32.  The capacity building program involves itself in accomplishing one of the key project \nobjectives and the Government policy of extending reforms for decentralized urban governance to \nthe small towns. The program aims to assist in the smooth establishment and development of \ncore capacities within the newly formed UDAAs for project planning, implementation, O&M, and \nfinancial  management.  The  program  will  apply  itself  to  updating,  adjusting,  and  extending \noperational and procedural systems, developed or being developed in other UDAAs. It will help \ngradually develop the organizational structure and urban management frameworks of UDAAs in \nthe small towns. Assistance in financial management will focus on establishing and implementing \n(i) cost recovery and local revenue generation measures, similar to those being implemented in \nVientiane; and (ii) transparent financial procedures for managing income and expenditure, and \nimproved budgeting and accounting systems. A major task will be assisting the UDAAs in \nmeeting the targets of their \u201coperational and financial action plans.\u201d Close coordination will be \nmaintained with the ongoing ADB TA (footnote 12) for strengthening the UDAAs in Vientiane and \nsecondary towns as well as the capacity building component of the Vientiane Urban Infrastructure \nand Services Project (footnote 9).  \n \n33.  The program will assist in forming a UDAA Network (i) to facilitate exchange of information \nand experience among UDAAs; (ii) to use the experience of individuals, who played a prominent \nrole in the evolution of UDAA reforms in Vientiane and the secondary towns, as resource persons \nand agents of change; and (iii) to create a forum for advocacy to accelerate UDAA reforms. \nPeriodic meetings and workshops will be arranged to facilitate the network activities.      \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n34.  Advancing and Extending Reforms for Decentralized Urban Governance. The most \nprominent feature of the Project is its support to the reforms for decentralized urban governance \nby which (i) urban administration is brought closer to the people; (ii) a more efficient, demand-\nresponsive, and equitable urban service delivery is ensured at the local level; and (iii) local \nresources and especially the resources of the service recipients are mobilized. The Project will be \ninstrumental in establishing and institutionalizing, in small towns, UDAAs with dedicated urban \nfunctions and own sources of revenues and budgets. It will help in developing core capacities in \nUDAAs and pave the way for them to become increasingly competent and autonomous urban \nlocal governments. Cost recovery for O&M of urban infrastructure and services by introducing \nand implementing user charges, fees, and other urban-based incomes is an essential element of \ndecentralized urban governance reforms. The relevant assurances, to which the Government \nagreed,  are  given  in  para.  73.  The  urban  policy  and  institutional  reform  agenda  that  the \nGovernment agreed to is presented in Appendix 5.   \n \n35.  Sector Lending Approach. Another feature of the Project is its sector lending approach \nas against the traditional project loan approach. The sector lending approach provides the \nneeded flexibility to make adjustments as implementation proceeds, and hence reinforces the \nresponsiveness to demand. The sector lending modality, adopted for the Project, incorporates \nseveral  strategic  features  and  incentives  to  promote  demand  responsiveness  and,  more \nimportantly, smooth implementation of the urban institutional and policy reform agenda. Entry into \nthe Project is conditioned by (i) the towns\u2019 demonstrated commitment to undertaking urban \ninstitutional reforms by establishing UDAAs and (ii) contribution to a portion of the capital cost of \ninvestments. The towns, to be admitted into the Project, are required to prepare time-bound \noperational and financial action plans to strengthen UDAAs and, more specifically, to increase \ntheir revenues and develop their staffing and technical capacities in a progressive manner \n(Appendix 4). ", "10  \n36.  Poverty Focus. The Project has a strong poverty orientation. Specific pro-poor features \ninclude (i) prioritizing the towns with higher levels of poverty for inclusion in the Project; (ii) \nprioritizing subprojects with higher poverty reduction impact; (iii) promoting inclusive processes \nthrough  an  extensive  community  dialogue  and  partnering  program,  accompanying  physical \ninvestments; (iv) integrated nature of interventions addressing the multidimensional nature of \npoverty; (v) direct targeting of the poor within towns through the village upgrading and livelihood \npromotion  program;  and  (vii)  promoting  good  governance  by  establishing  in  small  towns  \ndecentralized  UDAAs  for  more  responsive  urban  management.  The  village  upgrading  and \nlivelihood  promotion  component,  which  prioritizes  villages  with  higher  levels  of  poverty,  is \ndesigned to address the poor villages\u2019 highest priority basic infrastructure and services needs, to \nbe determined by the village communities themselves. It is also designed to improve the income-\ngenerating ability of the poor households. The specific elements of the program include (i) \nadequate representation of the poor and women in village working committees, (ii) allowing the \npoorer villagers to contribute in kind to the cost of improvements, and (iii) promoting community-\nbased service delivery and village contracts for solid waste collection, by which the poor\u2019s burden \nof service charges is relieved. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in \nAppendix 6.       \n \n37.  Participatory  Approaches.  The  Project  puts  a  strong  emphasis  on  participatory \napproaches by incorporating a process of community dialogue into all stages of the Project. \nParticipatory processes at the town level are fostered under the village upgrading program where \nthe village organizations and communities are assigned a major role in planning, implementing, \noperating, and maintaining improvements. To ensure that the intended participatory processes \nare followed, the Project provides considerable input for implementing a program of community \ndialogue  and  partnering,  involving  assistance  in  designing  and  implementing  consultative \nprocesses, and capacity building for UDAA staff, village organizations, and communities for \ncommunity-based improvements. It is planned that the existing structures in villages and districts \nof the Lao Women\u2019s Union and, wherever possible, NGOs with relevant experience will also be \nutilized in these processes. \n  \n38.  Private Sector Participation. The Project promotes private sector participation in urban \nservice delivery. In some small towns, the private sector has already been involved in solid waste \ncollection and disposal services albeit in a rudimentary way. But, success is constrained primarily \nby the low level of user charges and fees, which are inadequate to cover the full cost of \noperations;  and  the  limited  capacities  of  town  administrations  to  undertake  and  supervise \nprivately delivered services. The strategy of the Project, therefore, will involve enhancing the \ncapacity of UDAAs (i) to formulate and manage private sector operations, and (ii) to implement \ncharges and fees at reasonable levels that allow local entrepreneurs to achieve a satisfactory \nlevel of cost recovery and sustain their operations. The areas of private sector participation, with \nwhich the Project may become involved, are solid waste management, septic desludging, and \nmanagement of public markets and bus stations. \n       \n39.  Environment. The initial screening of potential environmental impacts of the subprojects \nindicates that the subprojects will not affect environmentally sensitive areas, nor will they cause \nchanges in the physical, biological, and social environment. Any adverse environmental effects \nwould be minor and easily mitigated. Indeed, most of the subprojects will bring clear positive \nenvironmental benefits. The proposed physical works are limited in scope and concern mainly the \nimprovement of existing facilities, drainage channels, and roads. Where sanitary landfill and \nseptic disposal treatment sites are proposed, the necessary mitigating measures will be applied \nto minimize negative impacts. The summary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 7.         \n ", "  11 \n40.  Resettlement.  The  resettlement  impacts  of  the  Project  appear  minimal.  Virtually all \nphysical works for the townwide infrastructure and amenities component in part A will be made \nwithin existing rights-of-way to avoid land acquisition. Since the towns are small and are not \nexperiencing uncontrolled development, there is no encroachment on the rights-of-way. In the \ncase of village upgrading, one criterion for subproject selection is that no land acquisition or \nrelocation is required. The only component that will involve some land acquisition is the landfill \nsites to be provided as part of the town cleanliness/environmental improvements. However, since \nthese sites are located outside the towns\u2019 inhabited areas, they will not involve relocation. Short \nresettlement plans, prepared for the first batch of towns, indicate that lost assets include land for \nlandfill sites, four wooden houses, and standing crops. Only three families will be relocated. The \nmain principles of resettlement framework that will apply to all the subprojects under the Project \nare to (i) avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement and loss of assets and income; (ii) where \nresettlement is unavoidable, carry out a resettlement plan to improve or restore the preproject \nliving standards of the affected families; and (iii) provide adequate compensation, at least at \nreplacement rates to all persons affected through loss of asset or income earning-capabilities. \nThe summary and detailed resettlement plans, to which the Government agreed, are in Appendix \n8 and Supplementary Appendix D respectively.   \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n41.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $20 million equivalent, comprising $9.7 million \nin foreign exchange (including interest during construction of  $0.4 million), and $10.3 million \nequivalent in local currency (Table 1).  The cost estimates include approximately $0.92 million for \ntaxes and duties. The total project cost was derived from estimates prepared for four small towns \nsubprojects. The estimates indicate an average cost of $986,000 per town for the proposed urban \ninfrastructure improvements and amenities, $300,000 for urban environmental services, and \nabout $239,000 for village upgrading.

The ADB loan will cover 100% \nof the foreign exchange cost and 66% of the local currency cost, excluding taxes. The Borrower ", "12  \nwill be the Lao PDR. The ADB loan proceeds will finance the full foreign exchange cost and about \n71.6% of the local currency cost of the proposed road improvements and other civil works and \n100% of the cost of consulting services, vehicles and equipment, and community awareness \nprograms and livelihood promotion.   \n \n43.  ADB financing for the local currency expenditure is justified by the country\u2019s limited \ndomestic resources resulting from (i) the low tax base and capacities that are constraining the \nGovernment  efforts  to  enhance  local  resource  mobilization;  (ii)  delays  in  several  planned \nhydropower investment projects intended to produce electricity for export to its neighboring \ncountries; and (iii) the global recessionary trend, which has resulted in slower export growth and \nlimited foreign direct investments for the country. The Project will also stimulate backward and \nforward integration in the economy, thereby enhancing its efficiency, as urban infrastructure \u2013\nroads, drainage and flood control facilities, public markets, and bus stations \u2013 linking strategically \nlocated small towns to the rural hinterland, is constructed or upgraded.   \n \n44.  The Government of the Lao PDR together with the community will contribute 20% of the \nproject cost, estimated at $4.0 million equivalent, to cover primarily land and relocation costs, \nincremental administration costs, taxes and duties, and the balance of the cost of the proposed \ncivil works. Residents of villages participating in the Project will also finance about 1%, estimated \nat $239,000, mostly through their labor contributions.11  The proposed financing plan for the \nProject is summarized in Table 2.   \n \n \nTable 2:  Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Share \nExchange  Currency  Cost  (%) \nAsian Development Banka  9.7  6.3  16.0  80 \nGovernment of the Lao PDR  0.0  3.8    3.8  19 \nBeneficiaries  0.0  0.2     0.2    1 \n     Total  9.7  10.3   20.0  100 \n a  Includes $ 1.63  million to be onlent to small town urban development administration authorities UDAAs. \n \n \n45.  The  UDAAs  to  be  established  in  selected  small  towns  will  contribute  $1.63  million \nequivalent through subloans from the Government using the ADB loan proceeds.12 The subloans \nwill carry an interest rate of 6.7% per annum, with a maturity of 15 years after subproject \ncompletion, including a grace period of 3 years.13 These subloans, while relatively small in \nproportion to the total estimated cost of each small town\u2019s proposed infrastructure and urban \nservices improvements, will strengthen the UDAAs\u2019 local resource mobilization capability since \ntheir repayment will entail the efficient collection of appropriate solid waste and septic disposal \nfees. The MFIs to be selected for implementing the livelihood promotion subcomponent will also \ncontribute $375,000 equivalent through subloans14 from the Government using the ADB loan \nproceeds. The detailed financing plan is in Appendix 9.   \n                                                 \n11  This is equivalent to 10% of the village upgrading costs for which villages expressed willingness to pay. \n12  At approximately $163,000 for each UDAA, these subloans correspond to the equipment and vehicle cost of the solid \nwaste and septic management investments. UDAAs will be able to repay the subloans through user charges for solid \nwaste collection and septic cleaning. The subloans may be reduced through contributions in kind.   \n13  The central Government will bear  the foreign exchange risk. The rate of 6.7% is based on the interest rate on the \nloan, a premium for forecast exchange rate risk, and a minimal spread to cover the government\u2019s management and \nadministration costs.           \n14\n The onlending from the Government to the selected MFIs will carry a 9 percent interest rate with a maturity of 10   \nyears and a 3-year grace period from component completion.     ", "  13 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \n46.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  MCTPC.  A  project  steering  committee \nchaired by the vice minister of MCTPC and with representatives from the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), Department of Public Administration and Civil Service of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, \nCommittee for Planning and Cooperation, Bank of Lao PDR, UDAAs, and provincial governments \n(vice governor) concerned \u2013 has already been formed. The committee will meet semiannually, or \nupon request by any of its members, to oversee project implementation, facilitate cooperation and \ncoordination among concerned agencies, and ensure timely implementation of the urban policy \nand institutional reform agenda.  \n \n47.  A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be set up in the Department of Housing and Urban \nPlanning of MCTPC. PCU, headed by a national project director, will (i) be responsible for overall \nproject  implementation,  programming,  budgeting,  and  financial  planning  and  accounting;  (ii) \nrecruit project consultants; (iii) confirm the selection of remaining project towns based on the \nestablished criteria; (iv) appraise subproject proposals, prepared by project implementation units \n(PIUs), before they are forwarded to ADB for approval; (v) provide administrative and technical \nsupport to UDAAs as implementing agencies; (vi) be responsible for overall execution of the \ncapacity building component; (vii) advise on procurement by UDAAs; (viii) be responsible for \nperiodic progress reports and project completion report; and (ix) organize a project performance \nmonitoring system.  The project director and the deputy director of PCU have already been \nappointed. \n \n48.  UDAAs to be established in each project town will be the implementing agencies. PIUs to \nbe located in UDAAs will be responsible for all aspects of project implementation, including (i) \nsubprojects  selection  and  preparations;  (ii)  detailed  design;  (iii)  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices under local competitive bidding (LCB); (iv) planning and implementing village upgrading \ncomponent; and (v) implementing civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering activities. \nTo use project implementation as a process for transferring knowledge and skills to the newly \nestablished  UDAAs  and  to  maximize  on-the-job  training  opportunities  for  them,  the  project \nmanagement and implementation activities will, as much as possible, be delegated to PIUs with \nthe majority of the consultants and counterpart staff being located in PIUs in UDAAs, and with \nPCU having a core unit with mainly coordinating and facilitating functions. A high level of \ntechnical support to UDAAs will be required from PCU and provincial and district departments of \nMCTPC.  \n \n49.  For the livelihood promotion component, suitably qualified MFIs, to be identified during \nproject  implementation  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon  eligibility  criteria,  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency.  MFIs  will  closely  coordinate  with  UDAAs,  especially  in  the  social \nintermediation activities. Because of the small nature of the livelihood promotion component, no \nseparate executing agency is proposed. However, the Bank of Lao PDR and MOF as members of \nthe national project steering committee will provide the necessary sector support and supervision \nover  MFI  activities.  The  detailed  implementation  arrangements  for  the  livelihood  promotion \ncomponent are given in Supplementary Appendix C.     \n \n50.  Provincial project facilitating committees (PPFCs), to be chaired by the respective vice \nprovincial governor and with representation from UDAA; Department of Communication, Posts, \nTransport, and Construction (DCTPC); Department of Finance; and other provincial and district \nagencies concerned, will be formed in each project town. The PPFC\u2019s main role will be to \nfacilitate UDAA reforms particularly actual delegation of functions from central and provincial \ndepartments to UDAAs, UDAA local resource mobilization reforms for levying and collecting ", "14  \nurban  charges  and  fees,  particularly  issuance  of  necessary  instructions  and  directives  at \nprovincial government level, support for staffing and logistics of UDAAs, and facilitating the \ntechnical support of other relevant departments e.g., DCTPC, to UDAAs. The committee will meet \nquarterly. The project organization chart is shown in Appendix 10.            \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n51.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 6 years beginning in early 2003, with \ncompletion by 31 January 2009. It will be undertaken in three overlapping phases, with three \nbatches of towns. The first phase will involve four towns, for which subprojects have already been \nprepared and are ready for appraisal. Phases 2 and 3 each will include a group of three towns \nwith subprojects coming onstream at the beginning of years 2 and 3. Each group of towns will \nfollow a 4-year cycle of (i) institutional and community preparation, (ii) survey and design, (iii) \nbidding and letting of contracts and construction, and (iv) post-construction activities. Phasing will \nlead more efficient use of project resources, particularly PCU staff, consultants, and equipment. \nAdditionally, it will provide time for delayed implementation to be completed within the designed \nproject life. The 6-year implementation period is considered appropriate, given the large numbers \nof subprojects, the geographic spread of the Project, and institutional capacities at the local level. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n52.  ADB-financed goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. ICB procedures will be used for major civil works contracts estimated to cost over \n$1.0 million and supply contracts valued over  $500,000. For civil works contracts not exceeding \n$1.0  million,  LCB  procedures  will  be  used.  The  Government\u2019s  procurement  guidelines \n(Implementing Rules and Regulations on Government Procurement of Goods, Construction, \nRepairs,  and  Services,  Dec  1998),  prepared  under  an  ADB  TA,  are  satisfactory.  Contract \ndocuments  for  LCB,  developed  under  the  Secondary  Towns  Urban  Development  Project \n(footnote 9), can be used, subject to ADB\u2019s review and approval. For supply contracts valued \n$500,000  or  lower,  international  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed.  PCU  will  carry  out \nprocurement through ICB and international shopping. Procurement through LCB will be initiated \nby UDAAs and be ratified by a bid evaluation committee to be chaired by the UDAA president and \ncomprising representatives from provincial and district DCTPCs. The documents will be sent ADB \nthrough PCU for review. The works and goods to be procured will be packaged on a town basis.  \n \n53.  For village upgrading, most of the works will be labor-intensive and will not require \nsophisticated technologies and equipment. A package of works per village is relatively small, at \nabout $30,000. It will, therefore, be appropriate to call for the participation in construction works of \nthe local communities, resulting in a sense of ownership and sustainability of the project assets. \nWorks that do not cost more than $10,000 are not attractive to private contractors, and where the \ncapacity  of  the  community  to  undertake  the  works  is  adequate,  community  participation in \nprocurement will be applied. Indicative procurement packaging is shown in Appendix 12. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n54.  International and domestic consulting firms will provide consulting services to assist PCU \nand  PIUs  in  three  major  areas:  (i)  overall  project  management  and  implementation;  (ii) \nimplementing the activities for civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering; and (iii) \ncapacity  building  for  UDAAs.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for engaging domestic consultants \nsatisfactory to ADB. Consultant selection will be based on the method of \u201cquality- and cost-based ", "  15 \nselection\u201d and full technical proposal will be used. An estimated 661 person-months of consulting \nservices (77 international and 584 domestic) will be required. The consultants, who will be \nengaged through one firm, will assist the PCU and PIUs in project planning, programming, \nbudgeting,  accounting,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  reporting,  preparing  and  appraising \nsubprojects,  detailed  engineering  design,  tendering,  supervising  construction,  preparing \nspecifications  for  purchase  of  equipment  and  vehicles,  setting  standards  and  systems  for \noperation of urban services and environmental assessments, and preparing and implementing \nresettlement plans, civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering program; designing and \nimplementing the village upgrading and livelihood promotion component, and capacity building for \nUDAAs. The terms of reference for consulting services are outlined in Appendix 13.     \n \n55.  Site surveys needed to prepare detailed designs will be sublet to domestic survey firms. \nDetailed design will be basically prepared by domestic consultants under the guidance and \ninstruction of the international consultant. Bidding documents for ICB will be prepared by the \ninternational consultant whereas those for LCB will be prepared in the local language (to be \ntranslated into English for ADB\u2019s review) by the domestic consultants under the guidance of the \ninternational consultant. During the construction period, the domestic consultants will undertake \nprimary responsibility for day-to-day inspection and supervision while the international consultant \nwill oversee and monitor  overall progress of the work, coordinate with MCTPC and prepare \nprogress reports for PCU to submit to ADB. \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n56.  Payment of eligible expenditures from the loan proceeds will be made either through \ndisbursement procedures, direct procedure, commitment procedure, or reimbursement procedure \nin accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, January 2001, as amended from time \nto time. Immediately upon loan effectiveness, the Government will open and maintain an imprest \naccount for the PCU in Vientiane to ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and expedite \nimplementation. Concurrently, subimprest accounts will be established in each project town. The \ninitial amount to be advanced to the imprest account in Vientiane and in each project town will be \nequivalent to the 6-month estimated expenditure, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \nFor  eligible  expenditures  incurred  and  paid  from  the  imprest  account,  the  statement  of \nexpenditures (SOE) procedure will be used. To liquidate and replenish an account, a withdrawal \napplication duly supported by documents in accordance with the Disbursement Handbook will be \nsubmitted. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will \nnot exceed $50,000. The PCU is responsible for supervising the administration by the PIUs of the \ntown-level imprest accounts, accounting operations, use of the imprest fund; consolidating the \nexpenditure reports; and supporting documentation for SOEs and withdrawal applications. \n \n6.  Advance Action for Recruiting Consultants \n \n57.  To expedite implementation, ADB approved the Government\u2019s request for advance action \nin engaging consultants. Selection is expected to advance up to the stage of evaluation of the \ntechnical proposals. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action does \nnot in any way commit ADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or the Project \nitself.  \n    \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n      \n58.  The Government, through the PCU will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports. The \nreport will be in such form and detail as ADB requests and include information on physical \nprogress of the works as well as on the institutional and policy reform aspects of the Project. The ", "16  \nPCU will also submit to ADB, within 3 months of the Project's physical completion, a project \ncompletion report that will give the details of project implementation, costs, benefit monitoring and \nevaluation activities, and other relevant information. The national project director, with assistance \nfrom an adequate number of qualified accounting staff, will establish and maintain separate \naccounts and records to easily identify income and expenditures related to the Project. All \naccounts and statements of expenditures and revenues related to the Project will be audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB. ADB will review the terms of reference for the auditors. \nAnnual financial statements together with audited project accounts and reports will be submitted \nto ADB within 9 months of the close of the financial year. Submitting audited financial statements \nmore than 12 months after the due date can result in ADB\u2019s suspension of loan disbursements.   \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n59.  Benefit monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken for each project component to \nensure that project facilities are managed efficiently and benefits are realized. The PCU, assisted \nby the consultants, will develop a comprehensive project performance management system \n(PPMS).  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  PPMS  activities,  including  the \nestablishment  of  benchmarks  through  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  data \ncollection, and analysis. The PPMS system will provide a mechanism to involve the community in \nthe system. Impacts to be measured are financial and technical competence of UDAAs, extent of \ncommunity participation, accountability, transparency, levels of coverage of services (especially \nfor  the  poor,  women,  and  minority  groups),  opportunities  created,  and  direct  employment \ngeneration. An external agency (NGO or academia) will undertake an independent monitoring \nand evaluation of resettlement. The PCU will submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring \nbenefits and preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months \nof loan effectiveness, and annual PPMS reports.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n60.  ADB and the Government will undertake jointly a comprehensive midterm review within 3 \nyears of the Project\u2019s start. The review will assess progress achieved by the Government and \nUDAAs on the urban policy and institutional reform agenda. It will also assess the performance of \nUDAAs in meeting the targets set in their operational and financial action plans. Subproject \npreparation,  appraisal,  project  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  will  be  examined. \nAmong the topics to be assessed are the performance of UDAAs in following community dialogue \nprocesses at town level and participatory processes as part of the village upgrading component; \nimplementation and procurement arrangements followed under the village upgrading component; \nthe adequacy of and adherence to the procurement arrangements, including transparency of \nselection  and  award  procedures;  performance  of  consultants  as  regards  support  in  project \nmanagement and implementation, community awareness, dialogue and partnership processes, \nand the capacity building component; Based on all these assessments, the midterm review will \nformulate, within the updated sector setting and other changing circumstances, the necessary \ncourses of action for the Government and ADB to ensure successful project implementation and \nthe Project's effectiveness in achieving its objectives. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n61.  General Gains (Social and Economic). The proposed Project will benefit a current \npopulation of about 143,000 and a population projected 170,000 in the next 6 years through an \nimproved urban environment resulting in improved health and living conditions in small towns. \nThe health and environmental benefits will arise from (i) upgraded roads leading to reduced dust, \nreduced death and injury from road accidents, and improved accessibility; (ii) improved drainage ", "  17 \nlessening localized flooding and its detrimental health impacts; (iii) wider coverage of solid waste \ncollection and better sanitation conditions resulting in reduction in sanitation- and fecal borne \ndiseases; and (iv) improved public markets and bus station environments. Health benefits from \ninfrastructure improvements will be further enhanced by a civic awareness program, educating \nthe community on the links between environment and health.  \n \n62.  The economy of the small towns will benefit from increased productivity of the populations \nas  a  result  of  health  improvements.  The  economy  will  further  gain  from  increased  urban \nefficiency, as the project interventions will reduce disruptions caused by poor road and drainage \nconditions,  flooding,  and  damage  to  urban  assets,  and  poor  environmental  services. \nImprovements to markets and bus stations will enhance the role of small towns as marketing \ncenters within the rural hinterland. Economic gains will spur the growth of the tourism industry in \nsome towns with great tourism  potential. An improved economy and higher incomes in small \ntowns  will  expand  the  urban  markets  which,  in  turn,  will  help  commercialize  and  diversify \nagricultural products with significant positive implications for rural development. \n \n63.  Impact on the Poor and Vulnerable. All the project interventions will either directly or \nindirectly have a positive impact on the poor. Where the interventions do not directly target the \npoor, socially inclusive processes incorporated into the Project will ensure  that the poor will \nbenefit proportionately. About 42,500 urban poor or 30% of the population will benefit indirectly \nfrom townwide infrastructure and services and environmental improvements. Road improvements \nwill enhance the mobility of the urban poor and provide them with increased access to income-\nearning opportunities. Drainage improvements will have a profound impact on the lives of the \npoor,  the  majority  of  whom  live  on  low-lying  land  prone  to  flooding.  Improved  solid  waste \nmanagement and septic disposal and construction of more public toilets will reduce the frequency \nof illnesses in urban poor households, as well as the medical expenses associated with illnesses.  \n \n64.  The  village  upgrading  program,  where  the  poorest  villages  have  priority  for  basic \ninfrastructure and services improvements, will have a direct impact on poverty reduction. About \n60 urban villages with high levels of poverty and an estimated 69,000 residents will benefit from \nimproved environment and basic services. The greater role that this program assigns to the \nvillages will ensure that the improvements are responsive to the needs of the poor. The program \nfor civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering will help villagers, especially the poor, to \nplay an active role in designing and implementing the village upgrading works. A significant gain \nfrom the program will be the improved capacities of UDAAs and villages for community-based \nplanning and service delivery and a sustainable program of self-funded activities that can be \nreplicated by the Government without project funds. \n   \n65.  A  number  of  project  components  will  directly  and  indirectly  impact  on  sustainable \nlivelihood and increased income-earning opportunities for the towns\u2019 populations, especially the \npoor. First, a direct impact on livelihoods will be achieved through the microfinance services to be \ndelivered by a sustainable and pro-poor MFI to be supported under the Project. An estimated \n1,500 poor households (about 8,400 urban poor) will be provided with microfinance services, \nincluding social intermediation assistance and loans \u2013 to support them in acquiring productive \nassets or working capital to develop viable livelihood enterprises. Complementary interventions, \nsupporting both the demand and supply sides of microfinance while adhering to the principle of \nsustainability will have a profound effect on the lives of the poor who currently cannot access \ncredit services. Second, improving the environments of public markets will lead to increased \nincomes for market vendors who form one of the major livelihood groups in small towns. Third, \ntemporary  employment  will  be  created  during  construction  of  the  urban  infrastructure  and \nimprovement of services. The use of labor-intensive technologies will generate employment. ", "18  \nFinally, significant job opportunities will be created with the village upgrading works, which will, \nwherever possible, adopt the procurement mode of \u201ccommunity participation in procurement\u201d.  \n \n66.  Given the dominant role of women in household management, sanitation, and health, \nwomen will be the primary recipients of the benefits from improved urban infrastructure and \nservices at both town and village levels. They will be a major target group in the village upgrading \nprogram and civic awareness and community dialogue activities. Being the principal sellers in \nmarkets, women in small towns and from the adjacent rural areas also stand to benefit from the \nimproved markets. The labor-intensive approach to project construction, accompanied with wide \npublicity on job opportunities, is most likely to benefit women as the Lao women are accustomed \nto hard physical labor. Livelihood promotion is expected to have a major impact on women since \n90% of the market vendors and most microentrepreneurs in small towns are women.  \n \n67.  A careful scrutiny of individual and joint project components in the identified subprojects \nindicates no adverse project impact on various ethnic minorities. Thus, no indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plan is required. Special measures will be taken to ensure that the ethnic minorities \nwill benefit equally from the project interventions. Civic awareness, community dialogue, and \npartnering activities will involve specific approaches to effectively communicate with the ethnic \nminorities. Selecting villages for upgrading will be based, among others, on the percentage of \nethnic  minorities.  The  principle  of  proportionate  representation  of  ethnic  groups  in  village \ncommittees will be strictly followed in the village upgrading program. Where the percentage of \nethnic minorities is high, utilization, in community dialogue and partnering programs, of NGOs, \nwith experience in working with ethnic minorities, will be sought. In case subprojects are likely to \naffect ethnic minorities, mitigation measures, either as part of a resettlement plan or a separate \nindigenous peoples development plan, will be prepared prior to subproject approval. \n \n68.  Institutional  Impact.  The  Project\u2019s  support  for  the  decentralized  urban  governance \nreforms will lead to more effective and efficient urban management. Establishing UDAAs with \nexclusively urban functions at the local level and creating a decentralized financial framework \nthrough  mobilizing  local  resources  to  finance  the  delivery  of  urban  services  will  lead  to \nsustainable  improvements  to  the  environment  of  small  towns.  The  towns\u2019  people  will  gain \nsignificantly from the increased capacities of UDAAs in urban planning and management.     \n \n69.  Impact on the Rural Hinterland. The Project will indirectly benefit a substantial number \nof rural people, from the surrounding and adjacent districts, who commute to the towns on a daily \nor weekly basis to use social services and amenities as well as the marketing facilities to \nexchange their produce with urban goods. It is estimated that about 127,000 poor people from the \nrural hinterland will benefit from improved road conditions that will give them access to urban \nmarkets, and know-how in selling, buying, and competing in the marketplace. The same rural \npopulation will benefit from overall improvements to infrastructure and services in small towns. \nImprovements to the sanitation conditions and amenities surrounding the produce markets will \nbenefit both vendors and buyers from the rural hinterland. The economic growth generated in \nsmall towns through overall infrastructure improvements will offer greater job opportunities and \nvalid livelihood alternatives to the slush-and-burn agriculture practiced by ethnic groups in the \nadjacent rural areas.15 \n \n70.  Economic and Financial Analyses. Economic and financial analyses of the proposed \nsubprojects were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Framework for the Economic and Financial \nAppraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. Base case economic internal rate of returns \n                                                 \n15 An example is Vang Vieng, where the growth of the tourist industry has not only spurred a large number of \nguesthouses and restaurants, but also created a specialized handicraft industry and a growing market for fruits and \nvegetables. The adjacent rural population, including ethnic groups who have changed from swidden culture into a \nsedentary life style, is now producing sizable crops of watermelons, oranges, bananas, cabbage, etc. ", "  19 \n(EIRRs) for roads and drainage works, which constitute 25% of the total Project cost, varies from \n19.26% to 27.50%, while base case EIRR for the flood protection subproject was calculated as \n33.6%, confirming the economic robustness of the proposed subprojects. Financial internal rates \nof return (FIRRs) for the revenue generating subcomponents  \u2013 solid waste management and \nseptic disposal improvements \u2013 were found to be financially viable, with base case FIRRs of 8.69 \n- 13.22%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital, calculated at 4.3%. The results of the \neconomic and financial analyses are presented in Appendix 14. The financial projections for the \nfour phase 1 towns are in Supplementary Appendix E.       \n \n71.  The Risks. Potential risks that may undermine or impede the project impacts include \nthose related to (i) the reforms for decentralized urban governance, (ii) sustainability of urban \ninfrastructure and services in small towns in general and project facilities in particular, (iii) \ncommunity attitudes, and (iv) technical aspects. The major risks related to the reforms for \ndecentralized  urban  governance  include  (i)  the  prolonged  process  of  enacting  the  local \nadministration bill and a level of uncertainty resulting from the use of decrees as legal tools to \nimplement reforms, and (ii) insufficient concerted action to support the process for establishing \nand developing UDAAs and mobilizing local resources. The risks to sustainability comprise, (i) the \nembryonic capacities of UDAAs in  small towns, including the capacity for O&M; (ii) overall \ninsufficient funds for O&M, and the insufficient own source revenues of UDAAs; and (iii) lack of \nGovernment support in the form of staffing and transfer of other resources, and lack of technical \nand advisory support to UDAAs from relevant central and provincial departments. Community-\nrelated  risks  include  lack  of  community  cooperation  in  the  village  upgrading  component, \nreluctance  to  contribute  to  improvements,  and  lack  of  awareness  of  the  benefits  from \ninvestments. The technical risks entail (i) the relatively large number of project towns spread \nthroughout a large geographic area, with adverse implications for scarce project and Government \nresources to ensure quality and the participatory processes; and (ii) a centralized mode of project \nimplementation, bypassing UDAAs and other local stakeholders. \n \n72.  To mitigate these risks, the Project has devised a strategy. The strategy involves (i) an \nurban policy and reform agenda and associated assurances agreed to by the Government as \nsafeguards for mitigating risks to decentralized urban governance reforms; (ii) a capacity building \ncomponent devoted to help UDAAs in establishing and developing their technical and financial \ncapacities and cost recovery reforms; (iii) specific measures of the sector lending approach \nrequiring the towns\u2019 commitment to UDAA reforms before inclusion in the Project, and operational \nand  financial  action  plans  motivating  the  towns  to  reform;  and  (iv)  project  implementation \narrangements involving national and provincial committees with greater potential to provide \nbroad-based  and  concerted  support  for  UDAA  reforms.  All  these  measures  also  provide \nsafeguards  to  mitigate  the  risks  to  sustainability  by  addressing  the  technical  and financial \nrequirements. Strengthening technical capacities of UDAAs in O&M forms an important element \nof  the  capacity  building  program.  The  impact  is  reinforced  by  the  decentralized  project \nimplementation arrangements enabling UDAAs to gain the most from the process and increasing \nthe towns\u2019 sense of ownership of the project facilities, resulting in sustainability. The financial \nrequirements of sustainability are addressed through the local resource mobilization reforms \nwhose  major  thrust  is  to  provide  secure  and  stable  sources  of  income  for  operating  and \nmaintaining urban infrastructure on a sustainable basis. The measures to mitigate risks related to \ncommunity  attitudes  include  incorporating  into  the  Project  an  extensive  program  of  civic \nawareness and community dialogue, which will motivate the communities to participate in and \ncontribute  to  improvements  and  thus  build  local  capacities  for  community-based  village \nupgrading. The risks related to managing and implementing a project in a large number of \ngeographically scattered towns is mitigated by adopting a three-stage implementation approach \nthat allows the optimum use of scarce project and Government resources.           \n ", "20  \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n73.  In addition to the standard assurances, Government has given the following assurances \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents.    \n \n(i)  The Government, provincial governments, and UDAAs concerned will undertake \ncertain reform actions as described in the urban policy and institutional reform \nagenda (Appendix 5).  \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that, within 3 months of loan effectiveness, a PM \nDecree will be issued to amend the Decree No. 177/PM, and Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice  (PMO)  Instruction  No.  141/PMO  to  provide  the  legislative  basis  for \nestablishing UDAAs in district towns with urban socioeconomic characteristics and \nto  remove  the  inconsistencies  between  141/PMO  and  177/PM  regarding  the \nestablishment of UDAAs in provincial capitals.         \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that prior to acceptance into the Project, the towns \nwill have agreed to establish UDAAs, within one month of confirmation of inclusion \nin the Project. \n \n(iv)  Each participating town will have agreed to contribute to a portion of the capital \ncost of the Project on the basis of the town\u2019s loan size and capacity to meet the \ncost of solid waste management and sanitation equipment and vehicle. \n \n(iv)  Town participation in the Project, and subproject preparation and appraisal will \nfollow  the  criteria,  procedures,  and  parameters  set  out  in  Appendix 4: Town \nParticipation and Subproject Preparation and Appraisal. \n \n(v)  Participating UDAAs will, prior to the appraisal of their subproject, prepare and \nagree to implement \u201coperational and local revenue mobilization plans\u201d with set \ntargets to gradually increase revenues from their own sources and to strengthen \ntheir technical, operational, and financial management capacities.  \n \n(vi)  Immediately upon the successful appraisal of their subproject, the UDAAs will \nbegin  implementing  user  charges  for  solid  waste  collection,  sanitation,  and \nparking; and slaughterhouse fees, fees for lease of public places, and hotel and \nguest house fees;     \n \n(vii)  The Government and pertinent provincial governments and UDAAs will ensure \nthat, within 2 years of subproject appraisal, the respective towns will begin (a) \nimplementing the special levies for wastewater and public lighting in the form of \nsurcharges on the electricity and water bills on a consumption basis, and (b) \nimplementing the urban obligation fees.  \n \n(viii)  To  ensure  adequate  funds  for  the  maintenance  of  urban  roads  through  a \ncombination  of  fees  and  charges,  including  charges  from  road  users,  the \nGovernment, within 2 years of subproject appraisal in each project town, will begin \nallocating annually to UDAAs, on a permanent basis and according to a rational \nformula, a portion of the monies accrued in the Road Maintenance Fund.  \n \n(ix)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  and  provincial \ngovernments will have issued decrees, instructions, and decisions to  empower ", "  21 \nUDAAs to levy and collect revenues including direct and indirect user charges and \nfees and property-related taxes to recover O&M cost of infrastructure and services \nfor which UDAAs are responsible.  \n \n(x)  Within 3 years of loan effectiveness, the Government, based on the study and \nproposal to be developed by 31 August 2004 by VUDAA for introducing a property \nrelated tax, will prepare a concept plan to introduce this tax in small towns.  \n \n(xi)  The Government, pertinent provincial governments, and UDAAs will ensure that \nUDAAs will generate sufficient revenues from their own sources to meet (a) within \n2 years of subproject appraisal 30%, (b) within 4 years of subproject appraisal \n65%, and (c) within 6 years of subproject appraisal 100% of the cost that they \nincur in providing services and undertaking O&M of existing and project-created \npublic assets including roads and drainage.  \n \n(xii)  The Government and provincial governments will provide UDAAs with sufficient \nfunds to meet any shortfall between the total expenditure that UDAAs incur in \nfulfilling their obligations (including their administrative costs and cost of providing \nservices and O&M for the existing infrastructure and the project assets) and the \nrevenue that UDAAs derive from sources available to them. \n \nVI.

The Lao PDR is essentially a rural country, with about 18% of the population living in urban1 \nareas.  However,  since  the  mid-1980s,  the  expanded  marketing  and  industrial  opportunities \nfollowing economic liberalization stimulated urban growth. As a result, growing numbers of rural \npeople were drawn to the urban areas in search of better livelihoods. Although the economy is still \nlargely rural, with agriculture accounting for some 50% of gross domestic product (GDP), the role \nof the urban sector is growing. During 1997-2001 the industry and services sector components of \nGDP increased at average annual rates of 8 and 6.2%, respectively, compared with 5.3% for \nagriculture, implying productivity and greater opportunities in urban areas. Vientiane, the capital \ncity, is the largest urban center with a population of about 200,000. The four largest provincial \ncapital, called secondary towns, have populations of 20,000 to 60,000. An emerging category of \nurban settlements is the small towns2 with populations ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 and growth \nrates of up to 4.3% per annum. These towns perform critical administrative functions, and are \neconomic links between the rural areas and national and international markets. They are the \nlocations of immediate markets, transport depots, and agricultural processing centers in the rural \nhinterland.  With  aggregated  markets  of  relatively  higher  incomes,  these  towns  help  to \ncommercialize and diversify agriculture in the rural region. The research and extension required for \ndiversification and inputs to rural production are supplied in these towns. A large number of rural \npeople commute daily to these towns to exchange their rural produce with urban goods and \nservices. Moreover, towns offer the rural poor labor markets during the off-farm seasons. The \nnonfarm employment provided in these towns is a sustainable alternative for the Lao PDR, where \necological sustainability is threatened by livelihoods dependent on natural resources.  \n \nA.  Urban Infrastructure and Services and Investment Requirements  \n \n2.  Over the last 6 years, the urban environment in the Lao PDR has improved significantly \nwith investments in Vientiane and the four secondary towns. It is estimated that ADB\u2019s second \ninvestment in Vientiane, the Vientiane Urban Infrastructure and Services Project, will meet about \n80% of investment needs, while the past and committed expenditure in secondary towns is \nestimated to meet about 50% of the investment needs until 2010 in these towns. However, the \nsmaller urban centers, to date, have not benefited from these investments. None of these towns \nhas a central or partial sewerage system, and existing on-site sanitation systems are in poor \ncondition with no provision for septic waste collection and treatment. The towns vary widely in the \nquality and coverage of drainage, roads, and solid waste management services (Table A2.1). They \nusually have no interconnected drainage networks, resulting in frequent flooding after rainstorms. \nWater in the roadside drains is polluted through poor on-site sanitation systems. Drainage, where it \nexists, becomes blocked with silt washed from the unpaved roads during rainy season. Only the \nmain roads are surfaced and are often in bad condition, while other roads, generally gravel or \nearth, are invariably dusty in the dry season and muddy during rainy periods. Maintenance of \nurban roads and drainage is irregular and suffers from lack of necessary funding and clear \narrangements. Solid waste management services are inadequate with no regular collection and \nfinal waste disposal. None of the towns have landfill sites. Town markets, where economic activity \nrevolves and where the poor can sell their produce and offer their services as porters and cleaners, \nare in poor hygienic conditions and lack surfacing, sanitation, drainage, and parking areas. Tertiary \ninfrastructure at the urban village3 level is also inadequate, and has a direct adverse impact on the \nquality of life of the communities, especially the poor. Access is generally poor. Roads have \n                                                 \n1 The official definition of urban is ambiguous. The 1995 population census defined a village as urban if (i) it is connected \nto a motor vehicle road, electricity, and piped water; (ii) it is the location of the district office; and (iii) it has a \nmarketplace. The urban planning law defined towns and urban areas as a place where many people live with a \npopulation density of 30 persons/hectare and a population of at least 2,000 and which has administrative functions of \nbeing provincial or district centers. \n2  There are 23 towns in this category. However, the distinction between small towns and secondary towns are not clear-\ncut as some have the same administrative importance as provincial capitals and high potential for future growth.  \n3 A village is an urban administrative unit/neighborhood with an elected village head and a population of about 1,000-1,500 people.   ", "26  Appendix 2 \nearthen and undrained pavements that become quagmires in the wet season. Conditions are \nworse in the poorer villages, undermining the health and productivity of the population in small \ntowns.  \n \n3.  The  sector  investment  plan  being  prepared  under  the  Project  and  agreed  to  by  the \nGovernment is based on the need for basic urban infrastructure and services until 2010. Target \nlevels vary between sectors and between the categories of towns, i.e., Vientiane, secondary towns, \nand small towns. Given the scarcity of resources, it is unrealistic in most cases to aim at a target of \n100% coverage. Clearly the targets are simplistic, but they serve as useful, measurable indicators. \nThey also reflect the priorities expressed by both local officials and the communities during the \nsurveys and workshops under the project preparatory TA. It is estimated that about $97.0 million is \nrequired to meet the overall urban infrastructure and service needs until 2010. This figure includes \nabout $44.0 million for the investment needs of the 23 small towns, including the further investment \nneeds of the 10 project towns. The figures present a fairly ambitious capital investment program \nthat the Government will find difficult to implement in its entirety. Accordingly, the investments need \nto be prioritized (Table A2.2). Currently, the Government\u2019s annual budgetary allocation for urban \ndevelopment and O&M amounts to about $5-$7 million. Most of the urban investment is through \nexternal assistance, with ADB as the major development partner in the sector. ADB has a project \nin its future pipeline to meet the basic investment needs of the remaining small towns. In addition \nto  ADB,  possible  sources  of  financing  for  urban  development  include  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and some bilaterals, e.g., Danish International Development \nAssistance  (Danida),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and  Norwegian \nDevelopment Agency (NORAD). It is expected that the ADB urban projects, whose major thrust is \nto establish capacities for local resource mobilization with application of user charges and urban-\nbased taxes, will assist in the short term the financing of O&M and solid waste and septic \nmanagement  investments  while  contributing  in  the  long  term  to  financing  the  overall  sector \ninvestments.             \n \nB.  Urban Poverty  \n \n4.  Analysis of poverty incidence in the Lao PDR indicates that about 27% of the urban \npopulation live below the poverty line. Urban poverty incidence is lowest in Vientiane, at 17%; and \nhighest, at 43%, in the northern region where most of the small towns are. Poverty incidence in the \nproject area is estimated as 30%. While there are no large aggregate poor communities in the \nsmall  towns,  poverty  is  dispersed  throughout  the  urban  villages,  with  some  villages \naccommodating much larger populations of the poor than others. Frequently, a few poor families \nhuddle behind the homes of wealthier villagers. The poor live on undeveloped plots without street \nfrontage or proper access roads. The plots are often poorly drained and prone to flooding. \nConditions are unhygienic, water- and feces-borne diseases are highly prevalent, undermining the \nhealth and income-earning abilities of the poor. Worse, the communities generally are not aware of \nthe links between health and environmental conditions. Lack of access to basic infrastructure and \nservices in small towns is both a cause and a consequence of poverty.  \n \n5.  While economic growth rates are higher in the urban areas than in the rural areas, there is \nevidence that economic growth has adversely affected the poor households in the urban areas, \nbecause of the subsequent greater income inequality.  A poverty assessment conducted with the \nfeasibility study suggests that the  most commonly expressed causes for poverty are lack of a \npermanent occupation and a low and irregular income. Usually, physical and social exclusion act \ntogether, resulting in a perpetual poverty cycle of poor access to basic services, poor health, low \nproductivity, and low incomes of the poor. The poorest of the poor depend on markets for their \nmain income, selling vegetables and forest products, and offering their labor as porters and \ncleaners. The vast majority of the middle and upper poor groups are engaged in market vending, \nhome-based microenterprise, and small retail activities. Existing and potential microentrepreneurs, \nhowever, are constrained by lack of access to institutional microfinance and associated services. ", "                                                                                                                    Appendix 2  27 \nSmall loans that these groups need are not available through the existing banking system. Most \nhouseholds report finance as a major start-up problem in establishing a livelihood. \n  \n6.  The incidence of poverty in small towns results from lack of programs effectively targeting \nthe poor and addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty. The limited funds in the context of \nlarge-scale  major  infrastructure  needs  have  so  far  not  reached  the  village  level  where  the \ncommunities would directly feel the impact from investments. While lack of funds constrains \nimprovement programs, a major problem is lack of effective strategies that could spark the initiative \nof the poor and mobilize the resources of village communities in improving their environment. The \nrecent policy of the Government to assign to villages a greater role in development provides an \nimmense opportunity to promote new approaches whereby village communities can become active \npartners in developing their own villages. However, improving basic infrastructure and  services \nalone  will  not  suffice  to  make  a  sustainable  impact  on  the  lives  of  the  poor.  The  poverty \nassessment highlights the linkage between poor environmental conditions and low incomes. It is \nessential that environmental improvements in small towns be complemented with interventions for \nlivelihood promotion so that the improved living conditions of the poor can be sustained.  \n \nC.  Urban Policy, Governance, and Finance   \n \n7.  The Government recognizes the significance of the urban areas in national development. \nThe Fifth Five-Year Socioeconomic Plan (2001-2005) prioritizes planning and developing basic \ninfrastructure and services in urban areas, including small towns. The Government\u2019s ambitious \ndevelopment goal is to reduce poverty by half by 2005 and eradicate it by 2010. The Government \nis keen on equitable growth and concerned with the important role of small towns in broad-based \nlocal  development.  The  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreement  signed  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment in September 2001 includes small towns development as one of the key operational \npriorities to enhance reciprocal linkages between urban and rural areas, more specifically to (i) \nintegrate rural producers with urban markets, (ii) enable urban entrepreneurs to trade with rural \npeople, and (iii) facilitate access of the rural and urban population to international markets. It is \nacknowledged that this vision requires interventions to meet basic human needs and stimulate the \neconomy in small towns.  \n  \n8.  Increasing urbanization led to the Government\u2019s recognition of the need for improved urban \nmanagement. As a result, urban governance in the Lao PDR has undergone a major transition \nover the last 6 years. Until recently MCTPC and its departments were responsible for planning and \nmanaging  urban  as  well  as  rural  areas.  In  1995,  the  Government  launched  a  program  of \ndecentralization and has established  urban development administration authorities (UDAAs) in \nVientiane and four secondary towns, with the aim to eventually transform them into autonomous \nurban local governments. The Government's commitment to decentralization has been reflected in \na number of prime ministerial (PM) decrees, instructions, notifications, and policy statements. Most \nsignificant for the decentralization process are decrees 177/PM issued in 1997 and 14/PM in 1999, \nthe operational instructions of 141/PM issued in 2000, the PMO Notice of 1461/PMO and Ministry \nof Finance Decision of 2083, both issued in October 2002. These decrees recognize UDAAs as \nlegal entities solely responsible for urban areas, and define them as organizations within provincial \nand prefectural administrative apparatuses. UDAAs are delegated tasks to plan and manage urban \ndevelopment, and to provide infrastructure and services, including roads, drainage, solid waste \nmanagement and sanitation, environmental protection, public lighting, and maintenance of urban \nassets. Moreover, the decrees empower UDAAs to raise revenues, within the levels set by the \ncentral Government, from a range of sources including service fees and charges, income from \nmovable or immovable property, sharing of national taxes, getting loans, local and foreign grants, \nand funds from the central Government. UDAAs are entrusted with using these funds to perform \ntheir tasks. Finally, the decrees also give guidelines on the organizational and working procedures \nof UDAAs.  \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n9.  The Government regards decentralization not only as a means for effective management, \nbut also a strategy for equitable growth and poverty reduction. It is now in the process of redefining \nthe role and culture of the Government, and rationalizing central-local relations. In the framework of \ndecentralization, villages are also underlined as the lowest levels of Government located within the \nproximity of urban communities and an important point of interface between the community and the \nGovernment.  Villages  are  envisaged  to  play  an  important  role  in  planning  and  monitoring \ndevelopment  activities  to  ensure  that  development  is  equitable  and  participatory.  Within  the \nframework of the foregoing decrees, UDAAs have been gradually developing themselves. They \nhave  made  varying  levels  of  progress,  with  the  Vientiane  UDAA  (VUDAA)  being  at  a  most \nadvanced stage in terms of organizational and technical competence as well as local revenue \nmobilization reforms. Since January 2001, VUDAA has levied and collected a wide range of direct \nand  indirect  user  charges  and  fees,  including  charges  for  solid  waste  collection,  desludging \nservices; and fees for vehicle parking, building permits, advertising signs, lease of public land, \nurban  obligation  fees  from  all  buildings  and  commercial  outlets,  and  surcharges  for  water, \nelectricity, and fuel. These initiatives in the urban sector are also supportive of the national goals of \nthe Government for domestic resource mobilization to finance recurrent expenditures for social \ndevelopment and to sustain existing physical assets.    \n \n10.  However, small urban centers to date have not benefited from these reforms. Urban \nplanning and provision of infrastructure and services still remain within the responsibility of the \nprovincial and district departments of the MCTPC. These departments, with limited staff and \nresources  and  widespread  responsibility  for  both  urban  and  rural  areas  in  their  respective \nprovinces and districts, cannot cope with the diverse demands of the rapidly growing and densely \npopulated towns that require dedicated management. The departments rely on the Government for \ntheir budget for providing and maintaining infrastructure. But there is little relationship between the \nbudget  requirements  and  the  allocations  actually  received.  There  is  no  separate  budget  for \nmaintaining urban infrastructure, and maintenance is severely underfunded. The degree of cost \nrecovery is minimal with user charges in most towns being confined to solid waste collection. In the \nabsence  of  separate  accounts  maintained  for  the  services,  it  is  not  possible  to  establish  a \nrelationship  between  revenues  and  cost  of  services.  The  situation  is  aggravated  by  the \npredominantly rural background of small towns communities who are not accustomed to the \nbenefits of urban services for which they are reluctant to pay. In sum, the current centralized \ninstitutional framework is not conducive to efficient service delivery and mobilizing local resources, \nand exacerbates the poor living conditions and state of infrastructure and services in small towns.  \n \n11.  There is need to extend the urban sector reforms to the small towns. The reforms to be \npursued should build on the existing reforms, and incorporate lessons learned from earlier efforts. \nThe  experience  with  UDAA  reforms  suggests  the  need  for  further  concerted  efforts  if  the \nmomentum of the reforms would be maintained. By their comprehensive nature, decentralization \nreforms require technical, financial, and legal interventions by a number of agencies at various \nlevels. The lack of an encompassing and permanent legal framework for urban local governments \nremains an issue, and has to be resolved in the medium term to secure urban policy and \ninstitutional reforms steadily evolving and operating over the last 6 years on the basis of decrees \nand decisions. The review of past efforts also shows that the commitments made through a \nnumber of PM decrees and decisions have not always been simultaneously supported by other \nconcerned agencies within the Government. While the financial and technical progress of VUDAA \nwas relatively promising, the progress of UDAAs in some secondary towns has been constrained, \nin some cases, by inadequate support of provincial governments or, in other cases, inability of the \nconcerned line ministries to actually transfer the assets, resources, staff, and revenue collection \nfunction to UDAAs. In sum, the scale of reforms toward an entirely distinct system of decentralized \nurban governance in the Lao PDR necessitates more dialogue and extensive support for the \nreforms and long-term assistance for building the capacity of UDAAs.   \n \n ", "                                                                                                                    Appendix 2  29\nTable A2.1: Existing and Targeted Level and Coverage  \nof Urban Infrastructure and Services in Small Towns \nItem  Namtha  Xay  VangviengPakxanh  Pek  Xamneua4 Towns 13 Towns \n                 \nSolid Waste                 \nExisting % HH with collection  6 0 12 0  0 40 0 0\nTarget %  90 90 90 90  90 90 90 90\nAfter project %  60 60 60 60  60 60 60 0\n% contributed by project  66 66 66 66  66 66 66 0\nProject costa ($ million)  0.22 0.22 0.22 0.22  0.22 0.22 0.88 0\nRemaining cost to meet target  ($ million)  0.11 0.11 0.11 0.11  0.11 0.11 0.45 4.33\nSanitation                 \nExisting % HH with septic emptying  0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0\nTarget %  80 80 80 80  80 80 80 80\nAfter project %  60 60 60 60  60 60 60 0\n% contributed by project  75 75 75 75  75 75 75 0\nProject cost ($ million)  0.28 0.28 0.28 0.28  0.28 0.28 1.12 0\nRemaining cost to meet target ($ million)  0.09 0.09 0.09 0.09  0.09 0.09 0.37 4.85\nPrimary/Secondary Roads                 \nExisting % surfaced  46 38 71 48  92 0 0 0\nTarget %  100 100 100 100  100 100 100 100\nAfter project %  60 50 80 60  100 30 30 0\n% contributed by project  30 20 33 20  100 30 30 0\nProject costb ($ million)  0.52 0.58 0.56 0.48  0.58 0.38 1.34 0\nRemaining cost to meet target ($ million)  1.21 2.32 1.14 1.92  0.00 0.89 3.13 14.52\nAccess Roads                 \nExisting % graveled  48 90 0 0  3 0 10 10\nTarget %  100 100 80 80  80 80 80 80\nAfter project %  90 100 50 50  50 50 50 0\n% contributed by project  80 100 63 63  65 63 57 0\nProject costc ($ million)  0.24 0.24 0.24 0.24  0.24 0.24 0.96 0\nRemaining cost to meet target ($ million)  0.06 0.00 0.14 0.14  0.13 0.14 0.72 5.47\nDrains Primary/Secondary                 \nExisting % lined  9 5 0 0  8 44 5 5\nTarget %  60 60 60 60  60 60 60 60\nAfter project %  40 50 40 30  50 60 30 0\n% contributed by project  60 90 66 50  80 100 45 0\nProject costb ($ million)  0.13 0.15 0.14 0.12  0.14 0.096 0.33 0\nRemaining cost to meet target ($ million)  0.09 0.02 0.07 0.12  0.04 0.00 0.40 2.38\nDrains Access Roads                 \nExisting % lined  0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0\nTarget %  80 80 80 80  80 80 80 80\nAfter project %  50 50 50 50  50 50 50 0\n% contributed by project  63 63 63 63  63 63 63 0\nProject costc ($ million)  0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06  0.06 0.06 0.05 0\nRemaining cost to meet target ($ million)  0.04 0.04 0.04 0.04  0.04 0.04 0.03 0.26\nMarkets and Bus Stations  0.00 0.23 0.00 0.10  0.12 0.15 0.43 1.39\nFlood Protection        0.18        \nStorm Water Drainage  0.13 0.10 0.18 0.08  0.09 0.06 0.32 1.04\nTotals for Sectors                 \nProject Cost                 \nRoads and drainsd  1.08 1.36 1.18 1.26  1.23 0.99 3.43 0.00\nSanitation  0.28 0.28 0.28 0.28  0.28 0.28 1.12 0.00\nSolid waste  0.22 0.22 0.22 0.22  0.22 0.22 0.88 0.00\nRemaining Cost                 \nRoads and drainsd  1.40 2.37 1.39 2.22  0.20 1.06 4.28 25.06\nSanitation  0.09 0.09 0.09 0.09  0.09 0.09 0.37 4.85\nSolid waste  0.11 0.11 0.11 0.11  0.11 0.11 0.45 4.33\nHH = household.                 \na Assumes replacement of existing solid waste equipment in Vangvieng and Xamneua.     \nb Assumes 20% of total road costs on drains.     \nc Assumes 95% of community-led village upgrading costs for roads and 5% for drains.     \nd Includes works around markets and bus stations, flood protection, and storm water drainage.

Town Participation \n \n1.  The Small Towns Development Sector Project targets urban centers, that have not yet \nbeen covered by other urban development projects and which have great potential to contribute \nto poverty reduction and growth not only within the towns themselves but also in their respective \nrural hinterland. To achieve the target, a systematic approach identified the small towns that will \nqualify for inclusion in the Project. Preparing the long list of small towns followed a two-stage \nprocess. Throughout the country there are over 140 urban centers that are either provincial or \ndistrict capitals. However, the majority of these towns are largely rural in character. Therefore, \nfirst, a population threshold of 5,000 was used for initial screening. This exercise produced a list \nof 42 towns. Second, more comprehensive criteria were applied to determine which of the 42 \ntowns have stronger urban characteristics and have the potential for broad-based development. \nThe  criteria  broadly  included  (i)  administrative  importance,  i.e.,  either  district  or  provincial \ncapital; (ii) provincial poverty index; (iii) population and rank in size in the province; and (iv) \ntowns\u2019 regional, subregional, and local role. As a result, 23 towns were identified. These towns \nform the long list of eligible towns from which the project towns were and will be selected on the \nbasis of further criteria described in the following paragraphs.  \n \n2.  Urban towns to be included in the Project will need to demonstrate their commitment to \nthe Project as well as to urban policy and institutional reforms. More specifically, the towns will \nbe required (i) to agree to establishing urban development administration authorities (UDAAs) \nand  gradually  strengthening  their  capacity;  (ii)  to  commit  to  increasing  locally  generated \nrevenues to gradually cover their operation and maintenance (O&M) costs by implementing cost \nrecovery measures and applying user fees, charges, and other urban based taxes; and (iii) to \nagree to contribute in cash or in kind to a portion of the cost of the capital works to cover the \nvehicle and equipment cost of solid waste management and sanitation/investments.  \n \nB.  Subproject Preparation and Appraisal \n \n3.  UDAAs will identify the subproject1 components to be located in the participating towns; \nfeasibility studies will be prepared by the project implementing units (PIU) in UDAAs with \nassistance from the consultants; appraised by the project coordination unit in MCTPC and \napproved by ADB. Upon acceptance into the Project each UDAA will prepare management and \nrevenue plans, to ensure that UDAAs take timely actions to progressively achieve the targeted \nrevenues  and  institutional  capacities  in  terms  of  staffing,  technical  skills,  managerial \ncompetence, and operating and working procedures. Subproject preparation and component \nselection will follow a process of community consultation involving a range of participatory tools \nto ensure that the subproject reflect the perceived needs and demands of all stakeholders.  \n \n4.  The components of subprojects eligible for financing under the Project include roads, \npublic and street lighting, bridges, drainage, improvements to public market and bus station \nenvironments  (without  improvements  to  buildings),  solid  waste  and  septic  management \nimprovements, and tertiary-level infrastructure and service improvements in selected villages. \nAfter the subproject components qualified for funding under the Project are identified, the \nPIU/UDAA with technical support from the consultants will proceed with subproject preparation \nand feasibility studies. PCU will appraise the subproject proposal and feasibility and submit \nappraisal reports to ADB for review and approval. The reports should include (i) the rationale, \nscope,  cost,  and  implementation  and  procurement  arrangements;  (ii)  environmental \n                                                 \n1 \u201cSubproject\u201d refers to an integrated package of  investment including a number of components qualified for \nfinancing. Each participating town will have one subproject.   ", "                                                                                                                                         Appendix 4  33\nassessments;  (iii)  economic  and  financial  justification;  (iv)  social  impact  assessment  and \nresettlement plan, if necessary; (v) UDAA financial assessments for O&M costs and debt \nservice  associated  with  the  proposed  subproject;  and  (vi)  operational  and  local  revenue \nmobilization plans setting the UDAAs target to increase their revenue and strengthen their \ntechnical financial and staffing capacity gradually. After ADB endorses the subproject, the \nUDAA will sign a subsidiary loan agreement with the ministries of finance and communication, \ntransport, posts, and construction regarding the loan and grant component of the subproject. \n \n5.   The following technical parameters should be considered during subproject preparation \nand appraisal: (i) subprojects will respond to the highest priority infrastructure and service \ninvestments identified under the town development frameworks and be directly aimed at poverty \nreduction, social development or improved economic opportunities for the town populations; (ii) \nthe size and scope of subprojects for each town will be determined by affordability to the towns\u2019 \nadministrations as well as town populations, to be supported by financial capacity assessments, \nin any case, the physical investments expenditure for each town will not exceed $1.5 million, \nunless it is justified through subproject appraisal reports and approved by ADB;  (iii) for all \ncomponents, the first priority will be upgrading existing facilities and strengthening their service \ncapability before the systems are reconstructed and expanded; (iv) in the case of solid waste \nmanagement and septic desludging and disposal and treatment components,  O&M plans, \nbudget requirements, and sources of funds to meet the budget and a commitment letter from \nUDAAs to implement  the O&M plans and avail of the required budgets including incremental \nrevenues  to  be  obtained  through  user  charges  must  be  prepared;  (v)  the  subproject \ncomponents in each town must use appropriate technology and represent the least-cost option; \n(vi) economic analysis should be undertaken for both revenue- and nonrevenue-generating \ncomponents exceeding $150,000 and when benefits are quantifiable; and (vii) financial analysis \nshould be conducted for revenue-generating components; financial returns should be greater \nthan the rate of the weighted average cost of capital unless there are affordability constraints, in \nwhich case, the financial interest rates of return (FIRR) should be as high as possible within \nthese constraints. Where user charges are associated with specific subcomponents, the users\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for the services should be proven in accordance with the overall cost recovery \ngoals and targets of the Project (see Assurances).         \n \n7.  In addition, social and environmental parameters and safeguards to consider during \nsubproject preparation and appraisal include the following: (i) areas of environmental sensitivity, \ncultural heritage, existing and potential tourist resources will be avoided, and where negative \nenvironmental impacts are unavoidable, mitigation measures will be taken to minimize the \nimpacts; (ii) an initial environmental examination will be prepared as part of the feasibility study \nin each town, in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and relevant \nADB guidelines and the environmental management and monitoring plan agreed to by the \nGovernment; this should be forwarded to ADB together with the subproject appraisal report; (iii) \nthe subproject will have no significant negative social impact such as loss of productive assets \nand livelihood, and physical displacement of people, and will minimize resettlement and land \nacquisition  by  exploring  alternative  approaches;

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a National Priority in                Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in                           Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  Country Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement? \n \nContribution of sector/subsector to poverty reduction in the Lao PDR:   \n1.  The Government\u2019s goals are to reduce poverty by 50% by 2005, to eradicate it by 2010, and to enable the Lao PDR to graduate \nfrom being a least developing country to a developing country by 2020. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for the Lao PDR and \nthe poverty reduction partnership agreement signed by the Government and ADB state that efforts will be directed toward reducing \npoverty by broadening community participation and opportunities during the next 5 years. The operational priorities to achieve these \ngoals are (i) rural development and market linkages; (ii) human resource development; (iii) sustainable environmental management; \nand (iv) regional integration. The Project aims to contribute to these operational priorities by providing strategically located small \ntowns with basic infrastructure and environmental amenities and capacity-building assistance, whereby (i) rural producers better \nintegrate with national and international markets; (ii) human development is enhanced; and (iii) nonfarm economy is strengthened, \npresenting a sustainable alternative for the country where ecological sustainability is threatened by livelihoods dependent on natural \nresources.  \n \nB. Poverty Analysis         Proposed Classification:   Poverty Intervention \n \n2.  Approximately 38% of the Lao PDR population of 5 million live below the poverty line, estimated to be equal to KN19,184 per \nperson per month for  the country as a whole in 1997/98. Evidence confirms the large rural-urban disparity in the incidence of \npoverty\u201427% in the urban areas compared with 41% in the rural areas. However, further analysis shows that the rate of poverty \nreduction in the urban areas has been slower, mainly due to the higher income inequality that has accompanied the faster pace of \neconomic growth.1 Urban poverty2 incidence is lowest in Vientiane (16.7%), and highest in the northern region (43.27%). Urban \npoverty in the central and southern regions are 27.65% and 35.84%, respectively. While the percentage of the urban poor is generally \ndeclining, the depth and severity of poverty in the northern and southern regions have worsen, clearly indicating that these regions are \nstill largely isolated from the benefits of the country\u2019s overall economic growth. \n \n3. A poverty assessment, conducted in the pilot small towns, under the project preparatory technical assistance, indicates that the \npoverty incidence in the project towns is 30%, higher than the national urban poverty incidence. The assessment reveals that urban \npoverty is characterized by (i) lack of permanent occupation; (ii) insufficient and irregular income; (iii) limited access to education and \nhealth care; (iv) deficient basic infrastructure and services such as roads and footpaths, sanitation and solid waste collection and \ndisposal systems, and flood protection works; (v) inadequate nonfarm employment opportunities; and (vi) lack of ownership of \nproductive assets. While there are no aggregate squatter areas in the towns in the traditional sense, poverty is dispersed throughout \nthe urban villages, with some villages accommodating much larger populations of the poor than others. Frequently, a few poor \nfamilies huddle behind the homes of wealthier villagers. The poor live on undeveloped plots without street frontage or proper access \nroads. These plots are often poorly drained and prone to flooding. Conditions are unhygienic; water- and feces-borne diseases are \nhighly prevalent, undermining health and income-earning opportunities. In most cases physical and social exclusion act together, \nresulting in a perpetual poverty cycle of poor access to basic infrastructure and services, poor health, and poor living conditions, low \nproductivity, and low incomes of the poor. The poorest of the poor depend on markets and forests as their main income, selling \nvegetables, and forest products and offering their labor as porters and cleaners. The medium poor can be subject to volatility, earning \nsome money but vulnerable to changing external conditions. The simple poor are slightly better off, but yet cannot escape from the \nperpetual poverty cycle. The poverty assessment indicates that the poor in small towns unanimously prioritize the lack of basic \ninfrastructure and services and the low incomes as the most severe problems that need to be addressed.     \n \n5.  The Project adopts a highly pro-poor approach and will contribute significantly to poverty reduction by addressing the physical and \nsocial barriers adversely affecting the urban poor in the Lao PDR, thereby enabling them to improve their overall living conditions. \nSpecific pro-poor features include (i) prioritizing the towns with higher levels of poverty for inclusion in the Project; (ii) prioritizing \nsubprojects with higher poverty reduction impact; (iii) promoting inclusive processes through an extensive community dialogue and \npartnering program, accompanying physical investments; (iv) integrated interventions addressing the multidimensional nature of \npoverty; (v) direct targeting of the poor within towns through village upgrading and the livelihood promotion program; (vi) promoting \ngood governance by establishing in small towns decentralized urban development administration authorities leading to more \nresponsive urban management; and (vii) assigning a greater role to villages, hence promoting partnership with communities and \ncatalyzing the resources of the community for village-level improvements.  \n \n1  This is not the case for the rural areas where the incidence of poverty was reduced more rapidly due to a lower increase in inequality.   \n2 The definition urban poverty is based on the equivalent income needed to purchase 2,100 calories per person per day plus some expenditure for \nnonfood items according to the ADB Participatory Poverty Assessment, Lao PDR, 2001.  ", "                                                                                                                                              Appendix 6  37 \n \n6.  The poverty impact analysis3 shows that the road improvements under the Project\u2019s town infrastructure and amenities component \nwill directly enhance the mobility of an estimated 425, 500 urban poor, or 30% of the urban population in small towns, by increasing \ntheir access to income-earning opportunities. This will arrest the worsening income inequality in small towns. Drainage improvements \nwill have a profound impact on the lives of the same urban poor population who tend to live on low-lying land, prone to frequent \nflooding. Improved solid waste management and septic disposal systems and provision of more public toilets in the markets and bus \nstations will decrease the frequency of illnesses among the urban poor households and, reduce the medical expenses associated with \nsuch illnesses. About 60 villages with higher levels of poverty will be targeted for village upgrading, providing its estimated 69,000 \nresidents with access roads, paved roads and footpaths, and a drainage system, leading to their enhanced mobility, reduced flood \ndamages, and improved health and sanitation conditions. The livelihood promotion subcomponent will provide an estimated 1,500 \nurban poor households (a total of 8,400 urban poor) with microfinance services, including social intermediation and loans of $200-\n$300 to assist them in acquiring productive assets or working capital to start viable livelihood enterprises. Moreover, an estimated \n127,000 rural poor will indirectly benefit due to (i) better road conditions facilitating their access to the urban markets for marketing \ntheir agricultural outputs and for increased knowledge on selling, buying, and competing in the marketplace and (ii) improved \nenvironment and services in small towns where a significant number of rural people commute on a daily basis.  \n \nC. Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared:                                                                                                         Yes  \n \n7.  A stakeholder analysis was conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance to identify stakeholders as well as their \nroles, interests, preferences, and aspirations. The primary stakeholders are (i) the general public who will be directly or indirectly \nbenefiting from project interventions as well as the few families who will be resettled as a result of the Project; (ii) village chiefs and \norganizations who will be both recipients and players of a major role in the village upgrading component; (iii) urban development \nadministration authorities, to be established in each project town, which will be the implementing agencies for the Project and which \nwill gradually become competent urban local governments; and (iv) members of mass organizations, especially the Lao Women\u2019s \nUnion at the village level. The stakeholders meetings demonstrated much interest in and support for the Project from village leaders, \ncommunities, and members of the Lao Women\u2019s Union. A poverty assessment conducted during the technical assistance also \nidentified the needs and priorities of various groups including the poor and the vulnerable. The inputs solicited from the stakeholders \nwere incorporated into the project design.  \n \n8.  Secondary project stakeholders include the members of central, provincial, and district authorities, e.g., representatives of the \nMinistry of Communication, Transport, Posts, and Construction, the executing agency, and other line ministries; the provincial \ngovernors, district chiefs, and other provincial and district officials. The stakeholder analysis indicated substantial support from various \nlevels of government agencies for the Project as well as its poverty focus and institutional reforms to be pursued under the Project. \nPrivate sector representatives, who are likely to be engaged in some urban service delivery activities under the Project, also \nexpressed their willingness to be involved in the Project.     \n \nParticipation Strategy:                                                                                                                        Yes \n \n9.  During the feasibility study stage, two rounds of workshops were conducted at the village and town levels in the pilot small towns, \nalong with less formal consultations, village transect walks, focus group discussions, and individual interviews. Consultations with the \nstakeholders and affected persons were undertaken to collect the necessary information and assess potential project benefits and \npossible adverse effects. The needs and recommendations of major stakeholders were recorded for project design and for further \ndissemination to concerned parties. The consultations sought much-needed stakeholder feedback and subsequent stakeholder \nsupport for the proposed Project by involving them in the planning and design processes.   \n \n10.  The Project will continue to use participatory strategies so as (i) to ensure that the improvements are responsive to the \ncommunity demands and (ii) to develop in the towns a sense of ownership of the project assets and subsequent sustainability. The \ncommunity dialogue program will target the towns\u2019 residents by disseminating information on project activities while providing periodic \nfeedback from town residents into each stage of the project implementation, i.e., subproject selection and preparation, detailed \ndesign, and construction. The community dialogue program at the town level will be fostered by community partnering at the village \nlevel to enable communities to become active partners in village improvements. The program will assist in building the capacity of \nvillage organizations and communities to participate in village planning and decision-making, choice of designs, procurement, \noperation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation activities. The villages will be assisted in establishing village-working \ncommittees and cost-sharing mechanisms. The village committees will have a proportionate representation of the poor and women as  \n \n \n3 The poverty impact analysis adopted a head count approach, which estimated the poor benefited from the Project as a proportion of the total \nbeneficiaries. This methodology is second best to the calculation of a poverty impact ratio (PIR), which was not applied because  (i) there were no \nfinancial revenues associated with the road and drainage subprojects and (ii) the economic benefits of the solid waste and sanitation subprojects were \ndifficult to quantify in the Lao PDR. Both factors made the rigorous application of the distribution of benefits and poverty impact analysis impracticable \n(ADB Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects). ", "38  Appendix 6 \nwell as other vulnerable groups. The program will train village leaders and key resource persons including women members as well \nas the staff of urban development administration authorities.  Existing Lao Women\u2019s Union structures in villages and NGOs with \nrelevant skills and experience will also be utilized in the processes of community dialogue and partnering. \n \n11.  Participation of secondary stakeholders, i.e., central Government agencies concerned, will be through a national steering \ncommittee consisting of the representatives of these agencies. Provincial and district authorities, whose support to the Project and the \nnew urban development administration authorities is vital, will be involved  in the Project through provincial project facilitating \ncommittees. \n   \n  D.

In Pakxanh, 25 families will be marginally  framework (RF) \naffected by the loss of 70 square meters each from their garden necessary for  and short \nthe construction of a small flood protection bank. Construction of a solid waste  resettlement plan \ndisposal site in Xay will require 6 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and affect 10  (RP) for each \nfarmers cultivating the area, while the landfill site in Vang Vieng will need  subproject \nanother 5 ha owned by the Government. The cost of resettlement and land  involving \nacquisition in the four towns is estimated at $42,000. No resettlement plan is  resettlement  \nneeded for Phonsavan as improvement works are in the existing rights-of-way.  See Appendix 8: \n  Resettlement Plan  \nStrategy: A resettlement framework providing compensation and entitlement \npolicies and procedural guidelines, which will be applicable to all subprojects \nunder the sector loan, was prepared. A short resettlement plan following the \nresettlement framework was prepared for each of the four subprojects. Major \nprinciples are to (i) avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement and loss of assets \nand/or income as much as possible; (ii) carry out resettlement to improve or at \nleast restore the preproject living standards of affected people (APs); (iii) fully \ninform and consult closely with APs in preparing the resettlement plans; and (iv) \nprovide adequate compensation, at least at replacement rates to all persons \naffected through loss of assets or income capacities. See Appendix 8. \n \nGender  Significant  Issues: Women\u2019s interests can be at risk if they (i) miss out on technical and  Gender strategy \norganizational innovations that come with the Project; (ii) miss out on the \nbenefits of the Project; (iii) are left out in the decision-making process, which \naffects their lives, including labor and assets.  \n \nStrategy: The Project will entail efforts to ensure that women and men benefit \nequally from Project, and that the Project\u2019s process is used to enhance women\u2019s \nrole in the development process in the Lao PDR. The Project\u2019s gender strategy \naims  to  (i)  mitigate  the  risk  that  women  will  be  disadvantaged  by  project \ninterventions;  (ii)  ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  community  dialogue  and \npartnering activities, e.g., meetings and training on an equal basis with men; (iii) \nensure equal representation of women (at least 40% representation) in village \ncommittees; (iv) promote men working together with women in the Project; (v) \nprioritize women in livelihood promotion; and (vi) carry out gender training and \nintegration programs with the assistance  of the gender resources information \ndevelopment (GRID) center under the Lao Women\u2019s Union. \n  \nPotential  Impact:  Given  the  dominant  role  of  Lao  women  in  household \nmanagement,  women  will  be  the  primary  recipients  of  the  benefits  from \ninfrastructure and service improvements, especially improvements to solid waste \nand sanitation management. They will be a major target group for the village \nupgrading and civic awareness and community dialogue activities. Being the \nprincipal sellers in markets, women in small towns and from adjacent rural areas \nwill  benefit  from  improvements  in  markets.  The  labor-intensive  project \nconstruction, accompanied with wide publicity on job opportunities and rules to \nprioritize  women  and  the  poor  in  these  jobs,  will  benefit  women  who  are \naccustomed to physical labor.

In the poorest villages, Lao  will be required to \nSuung are found as the majority in some villages in Xai and Pek and in equal  submit an \nnumbers to Lao Theung in Namtha. In Paxhan, the population in the poorest  indigenous plan \nvillages is nearly 100% Lao Loum, confirming the socioeconomic data for all  before the \nvillages and leading to the conclusion that there is no direct correlation between  subproject is \npoverty and ethnic minorities in the towns.  Moreover, a careful examination of  approved. \nindividual and joint project components in relation to the composition and spread   \nof population in towns indicates no adverse impact on ethnic groups. \n    \nStrategy: As part of the pro-poor strategy of the Project, special measures will \nbe adopted to ensure that ethnic minorities will benefit equally from project \ninterventions. Civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering activities will \ninvolve specific approaches to effectively communicate with ethnic minorities. \nSelection of villages for upgrading will be based, in part, on the percentage of \nethnic minorities. The principle of proportionate representation of ethnic groups \nin village committees will be strictly followed under the community-led village \nupgrading  program.  Where  the  percentage  of  ethnic  minorities  is  high, \nnongovernment organizations with experience in working with ethnic minorities \nwill be sought for the community dialogue and partnering programs.  \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried \nout as part of Project preparation. The IEE incorporates three elements:  (i) a general IEE for the \nProject overall; (ii) sample IEEs for two subprojects whose feasibilities were undertaken (not \nincluded in this summary IEE) during the project preparatory technical assistance; and (iii) an \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP).  The last is required as this is a sector \nloan. The EMMP provides guidelines for subprojects to be prepared during project implementation. \nThe initial screening of the potential environmental impacts of the subprojects prepared for the four \ntowns indicates that the Project will have few negative impacts on the physical, biological, or social \nenvironments. It will have a net positive impact on the ecology of the surrounding areas and a \nsignificant overall effect on the physical environment.   \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The project objective is to improve the urban environment and infrastructure and services in \nselected small towns, and establish decentralized urban institutions. It has six components: only \nthree are considered to have potential environmental impacts, the others are in the management or \nsoftware category. The three components are (i) town infrastructure and amenities, involving road \nand drainage works and improvements to the public markets and bus station environments; (ii) \ntown cleanliness/environmental services, including improvements to solid waste management and \nsanitation and construction of landfill and septic disposal sites; and (iii) community-led village \nupgrading, with improvements to tertiary infrastructure and services. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  Physical Environment: All project towns are classified as urban or semiurban. They are \ncharacterized  by  low-  rise  development  with  occasional  medium-rise  development  containing \nsignificant areas of poor quality infrastructure and housing, interspersed with small areas of open \nwasteland  and  urban  agriculture,  particularly  rice  paddy.  Annual  rainfall  ranges  from  1,000 \nmillimeter (mm) to 2,800 mm. Temperatures range from 18oC during December to February (10oC \nin Xam Neua) to 33oC during the hot, dry season in March to May.  \n \n4.  Biological Environment:  There are no known endangered varieties of flora, or species of \nfish or fauna in the project towns.  Some parts of the towns are rural in character with abundant \ntrees and agriculture, typically rice fields. \n \n5.  Sociocultural Environment: The people residing in the contiguous urban areas of each of \nthe six towns are reported to comprise more than 98% ethnic Lao Leum. The towns of Pek, \nNamtha, and Xam Neua have largely developed and have been repopulated since 1975. A site of \ncultural and historic significance exists at the Plain of Jars, some 5 kilometer (km) from M. Pek. \n \nD.   Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n6.  Positive Environmental Impacts: The positive environmental benefits accruing from the \nproject interventions include (i) reduced health risks associated with polluted and/or stagnant water \nand flooding, as a result of drainage and sanitation improvements; (ii) reduced damage to property \nand infrastructure from reduced flooding; (iii) reduced air pollution, dust, and rates of injury and \ndeath from traffic accidents as a result of reduced vehicle emissions due to improved roads and \nstreets; (iv) reduced odor and insect nuisance related to improved solid waste collection and \ndisposal; and (v) overall environmental improvements.  \n ", "                                                                                                                      Appendix 7    41 \n7.  Environmental Problems Due to Project Location:  Few environmental problems are \nassociated with the subproject locations. With the exception of landfill sites, all components will be \nconfined to upgrading of existing facilities within the existing rights-of-way. In the case of landfill \nsites that involve land acquisition and minimal resettlement, resettlement plans were prepared. In \nno case will the project improvements encroach on environmentally sensitive areas. The site of the \nproposed sanitary landfill site in Pek is 2 km away from the area developed for tourism at the Plain \nof Jars. The site is visible from vantage points near the Plain of Jars, and will be screened by \nplanting trees early in project implementation to mitigate any negative effect.  \n \n8.  Environmental Problems Related to Design: The design of the subprojects will minimize \nadverse environmental impacts. The outputs will be either underground or at the ground surface \nand therefore have no adverse visual impact. Storm water drainage will be fitted with trash racks to \ncollect  paper,  plastic,  and  other  debris.  Sullage,  septic  effluent,  and  other  pollutants  will  be \nspecifically excluded from storm water drainage. Selected landfill sites are at least 3 km from the \nedge  of  the  urban  area  and  will  be  designed  to  avoid  leaching  of  wastewater  into  natural \nwaterways or groundwater and to provide adequate methane outlets to avoid potential fire hazards. \nCollected septic effluent will be discharged to shallow clay-lined ground tanks adjacent to the \nlandfill site for stabilization and separation prior to disposal. All underground drainage, riverbank \nprotection, and the one bridge will be hydraulically designed to ensure that flow of surface water is \nnot impeded. Infrastructure design will ensure adequate drainage of properties abutting the public \nland. \n \n9.  Environmental Problems Associated with Construction: The design of all works will be \nundertaken  with  concern  for  the  avoidance  of  erosion  both  during  construction  and  upon \ncompletion. Work will be programmed to avoid, to the extent possible, community disruption or \ntraffic congestion. Strict measures, including the use of retention basins, will be enforced to prevent \nwater pollution, particularly where construction sites are located close to natural waterways. No \nroad closures are anticipated during the construction period and the contractor will be required to \nminimize impeding access at all times. \n \n10.    Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations. Full environmental \nbenefits will be achieved only with the adequate operation and maintenance (O&M) of project \noutputs. Environmental benefits will not accrue if the need for establishing a maintenance capacity \nat all levels and ensuring maintenance funding is ignored. The capacity building component of the \nProject will provide the necessary O&M systems and skills. Local resource mobilization reforms will \nprovide the funds required for O&M.   \n \n11.  Project Demobilization:  Project outputs are likely to remain in place until upgraded in the \nfuture.  Thus  no  negative  environmental  impacts  associated  with  demobilization  or \ndecommissioning are anticipated. \n \nE.  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n \n12.  As the Project is a sector loan project, an  EMMP is required. The EMMP provides a \nframework to ensure that the project meets both ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s requirements for \nsafeguarding the environment, and sets out guidelines and parameters on environmental issues \nwhen selecting and implementing future sub-projects.  \n \n13.  Criteria  for  Future  Sub-project  Selection:  Subproject  selection  will  avoid  areas  of \nenvironmental sensitivity, sites that could impact on areas of important cultural heritage, and areas \nwhere there are geologic or topographic problems. Sites will be avoided if project activities will \nadversely affect, either groundwater or surface water likely to be used by others, and mitigation is \nnot possible. Site selection will consider the potential nuisance to surrounding areas during the ", "42  Appendix 7 \nconstruction  period.  Site  selection  will  minimize  land  use  changes  and  impact  on  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods or personal property.  \n \n14.  Environmental Impact Assessments and Approval Procedures:  The Project will meet \nthe requirements of both ADB and the Government in terms of environmental impact evaluations \nand assessments. The Science, Technology and Environment Agency (STEA) at the provincial or \nnational level will first approve the subprojects, and then the IEE, along with comments from the \nconcerned agencies, will be submitted to ADB for endorsement before constructing the subproject.  \n \n15.  Performance  Indicators:  The  subprojects  will  be  monitored  for  their  impacts  on  the \nproblems that they were designed to address. The performance indicators include air and water \nquality,  incidence  of  disease  due  to  waterborne  vectors,  incidence  of  complaints  regarding \nuncontrolled solid waste disposal, and incidence of flooding. \n \n16.  Measurement Parameters: The indicators (para. 15) will be measured under a controlled \nmonitoring  program.    It  will  be  important,  particularly  in  the  early  years,  to  ensure  that  the \nmeasurement of the parameters chosen is within the scope of the local authorities.   \n \n17.  Institutional Capacities in Environmental Assessment:  The provincial offices of STEA \nwill be responsible for environmental monitoring outside Vientiane and will report to STEA and the \nrespective provincial governor\u2019s offices. This provincial level representation has been established \nin all provinces except Xaysomboun Special Zone and Vientiane Prefecture. Staff has been \nappointed locally, with officers in the provinces varying from 3 to 10 people. Technical capacity in \nall provinces is limited. Only a few of the appointed staff have any training in environment-related \nskills.  Because of the limited capacity in the STEA provincial offices, capacity building will be \nrequired and STEA assistance at the national level will be necessary. While it is not desirable for \nan organization to be involved in monitoring its own activities, support from the project coordination \nunit (PCU) and the consultants will be necessary from time to time. There is provision in the \nProject\u2019s consulting services for environmental expertise, particularly for conducting IEEs.  This \ncould result in direct skills transfer through close liaison with the provincial STEAs. \n \n18.  Monitoring Timescales and Reporting Arrangements: Monitoring will be carried out \nregularly. Initially the timescale will reflect the limited capacities of the agencies involved. The \nminimum interval will be 6 months, so that one measurement can be taken in the wet season and \none in the dry season. Urban development administration authorities (UDAAs), which are the \nimplementing  agencies  in  each  town,  will  work  closely  with  provincial  STEAs.  With  PCU \nassistance, UDAA will submit reports to provincial STEA.  \n \nF.   Findings and Recommendations \n \n19.  The Project will contribute significantly to improved living conditions and the well-being of \nthe urban poor. The identified adverse effects will be readily addressed through proper engineering \ndesign and incorporation of identified mitigation measures. The EMMP will ensure that future \nsubprojects are also subjected to rigorous environmental assessment.  \n \nG.  Conclusion  \n \n20.  On the basis of this initial evaluation, the Project is unlikely to result in any major adverse \nenvironmental impacts. In fact, it will result in environmental improvements. An environmental \nimpact assessment is not considered necessary.   ", "                                                                                                                              Appendix 8    43 \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND RESETTLEMENT PLANS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  In  accordance  with  the  (ADB\u2019s)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  for  sector  loans, \nresettlement will adhere to the resettlement framework (RF). RF stipulations described here will \napply to all subprojects that are and will be prepared and approved for inclusion in the sector loan \nproject. Short resettlement plans have already been prepared for four pilot towns\u2019 subprojects in \naccordance with the RF and will form models for land acquisition and resettlement under the new \nsubprojects (para. 11-15). \n \nB.  Resettlement Framework \n \n2.  The RF is based on (i) ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on \nResettlement (1998), (ii) the Lao PDR\u2019s legislative framework, and (iii) good practices established \nunder ADB-supported projects, as the Government has yet to adopt a distinct official policy for \ninvoluntary resettlement.1 All land is the property of the nation and ownership means only the right \nto use land. However, land rights are transferable and the right to use land is effectively equivalent \nto ownership. Various articles of the Land Law2 protect constitutional rights of land users. \n \n3.  The main RF principles follow (i) avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement and loss of \nassets and/or income as much as possible; (ii) carry out resettlement so as to improve or at least \nrestore the preproject living standards of the affected persons (APs); (iii) fully inform and consult \nclosely with APs in preparing resettlement plans (RPs); (iv) give adequate compensation, at least \nat replacement costs, to all who lose either assets or income-earning capabilities; (v) compensate \nasset at replacement rates; (vi) compensate for lost assets and give resettlement subsidies in full,  \nbefore ground leveling or demolishing of the affected asset; and (vii) absence of a formal legal title \nshould not bar occupants from being compensated.  \n \n1.  Resettlement Procedural Guidelines \n \n4.  In preparing subproject RPs, the following steps will be followed: (i) during the preliminary \nproject design stage, identify the category under which the Project falls, whether it has (a) no \nresettlement effect, (b) insignificant resettlement effects, or (c) significant resettlement effects; (ii) in \nfurther defining the subproject design, consult with potential APs to avoid negative resettlements \neffects; (iii) in the case of categories (b) and (c) conduct enumeration and socioeconomic surveys \nof potential APs and types and levels of loss; (iv) parallel to the AP census survey, continue \nconsulting with APs to identify their preferences and special needs; (v) prepare a RP; (vi) present \nthe RP at a public meeting; and (vii) submit the RP to the project coordination unit (PCU), which \nwill then forward it to ADB for review and clearance, together with the subproject appraisal reports. \n \n5.  Consultation and Public Participation in Resettlement. During the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance when subprojects were prepared for four towns, consultation was carried out \nin three phases. In the  initial phase, information was collected and disseminated to selected \nstakeholders (particularly potential APs) to promote awareness and assess the towns\u2019 subproject \nbenefits and adverse impacts. In the second phase, concerns of and suggestions from various \n                                                 \n1  The draft national resettlement policy, however, has been made and discussed. Also, the principle of property \nownership and the protection of ownership rights stated in various laws provide a framework for resettlement. \n2  These include Article 5 (protection of various categories of land); Article 6 (persons managing or using the land legally \nhave the rights to receive compensation for any loss or damage in the event that the Government acquires the right to \nuse the land for the benefit of the public); Article 43 (entitlements/rights to use land); Article 63 (termination of right to \nuse land); and Articles 67-71 (requirement for each village, municipality, province, or special zone to keep 5% of its \ntotal land area in reserve for compensating requisitioned land). ", "44  Appendix 8   \nstakeholders3 were elicited, and information obtained from the initial phase was further processed \nand disseminated. The final phase included testing of subproject design and detailed assessment \nof adverse effects. Previously overlooked or outstanding concerns of stakeholders received a \nforum for review, and APs were actively involved in the project tasks, committees, and decision-\nmaking.  \n \n6.  During the preparation of future subprojects under the sector loan, similar consultations will \ntake place to enable APs to participate in key decisions that affect their lives. Consultation will start \nas early as possible. Project implementing units (PIUs) in the urban development administration \nauthorities (UDAAs), assisted by community development consultants, will ensure that all potential \nbeneficiaries and APs are properly and promptly informed of subproject activities, including the \ntype  of  work  to  be  implemented,  the  schedule  of  works,  and  potential  impacts.  Further \nconsultations will be carried out during social analysis as part of the subprojects\u2019 feasibility studies \nto assess the needs and preferences of APs for compensation and rehabilitation. This will ensure \ngeneral understanding with key stakeholders. The cooperation of the village chiefs and members \nof the Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) will be critical.    \n \n7.  Compensation and Entitlements. All persons who are adversely affected by project \nimplementation, whether through loss of assets or income-earning capabilities, have the right to \nadequate compensation. The  losses include (i) permanent loss of agricultural land, (ii) loss of \nresidential and/or commercial land, (iii) loss of residential and/or commercial structures, (iv) loss of \nstanding crops and trees, and (v) loss of hired wage labor-days. In principle, lost land should be \nreplaced with land at least equal in size and value and with valid title and registration; and loss of \nhouses, other structures, crops and trees, is compensated at replacement cost. Vulnerable groups \nwill be eligible for additional support and income restoration measures. If compensation alone is \nnot adequate to sustain or improve the livelihood of APs, additional rehabilitation measures must \nbe developed for the purpose. The cutoff date is the moment when UDAAs notify the population at \nlarge about the Project and the resettlement consequences. Families that settle after the cut-off \ndate will not be entitled to compensation payments or allocation (Table A8). \n \n8.  Grievance Redress. To ensure that affected people have avenues for redressing their \ngrievances related to any aspect of land acquisition, income loss, relocation, compensation, and \nrehabilitation assistance, a three-step procedure will be followed: (i) the claimant (AP or potentially \naffected person) lodges a complaint with the UDAA resettlement officer in the presence of the \nvillage head. The resettlement officer will process the complaint in coordination with the village \nhead and village LWU member within 15 days of the receipt of the grievance. If the conflict cannot \nbe settled, the claimant appeals to the Town Resettlement Committee (TRC) to be chaired by the \nUDAA president and comprising representatives of UDAA, relevant provincial and district offices, \npertinent village heads, and LWU. The committee is to confirm the receipt of the claim and to \nrespond to the claimant within 15 days. If the claimant is still not satisfied, or if for any reason the \npackage does not materialize, the claimant appeals to the  Project Grievance Committee. The \ncommittee, to be headed by the director of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning and \ncomprising representatives from the Justice Department, LWU, the PCU, and the Ethnic Council, \nwill investigate, arrange meetings with officials concerned, or resolve the dispute on the spot. \nMinutes of the committee deliberations and decisions will be sent to the PCU and the external \nmonitoring  party,  and  all  correspondence  will  be  duly  recorded.  The  grievance  procedures, \nhowever, do not take away the constitutional rights of any claimant to lodge a complaint with the \nDistrict People\u2019s Court. \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Stakeholders include the general public who will benefit from project families with potential to be affected by the project \nthrough land acquisition or resettlement, village heads and communities, UDAAs, and particularly their public relations \nand conflict settlement divisions, provincial and district departments, project coordination unit (PCU), contractors, and \nadvocacy groups e.g., LWU.  ", "                                                                                                                              Appendix 8    45 \n2.  Institutional Responsibilities \n \n9.  Given the likely small scale of the resettlement component of the Project, the institutional \nframework will be simple and flexible. Within the PCU based in the Executing Agency, the Ministry \nof Communication, Transport, Posts, and Construction, a senior officer will be responsible for \noverall coordination and supervision of the RPs and activities. The officer will have counterparts, \nresettlement officers, in PIUs based in UDAAs, and will guide UDAAs, which will be responsible for \npreparing and implementing the RPs. RPs, where necessary, will be prepared as part of the towns\u2019 \nsubproject feasibility reports, by the PIUs with assistance from the project management and \nimplementation consultants, including a resettlement expert provided to assist PIUs in carrying out \nresettlement tasks. Public relations and conflict settlement units of UDAAs will be closely involved \nin all resettlement activities. The plans prepared by PIUs will be forwarded to PCU before the \ntowns\u2019 subprojects are approved and will then be forwarded to ADB for clearance. The TRC will \noversee the resettlement activities and arbitrate in case of conflicts.  \n \n3.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n10.  To ensure that the policies and principles of the RP are adhered to and that villagers \nimprove their livelihood after resettlement, monitoring will be carried out internally by PCU in \ncoordination with PIUs, and externally by an independent monitoring agency (nongovernment \norganization or academia) to be hired for the purpose. Internal monitoring by PCU will focus on the \nprogress of the resettlement activities in accordance with the timetable given in the RP. PIUs will \nprepare quarterly resettlement progress reports for each town where resettlement takes place and \nforward them to PCU for review. The reports will include progress in information dissemination to \nAPs and community consultation, land acquisition, land replacements, and compensation for \nrelocation. Monitoring indicators will include (i) household socioeconomic data (disaggregated by \ngender), (ii) payments of compensation and disbursement of other benefits to APs as identified in \nthe entitlement matrix, (iii) level of restoration of business and income after resettlement or project \nconstruction, and (iv) pre- and post-project construction living standards measured in qualitative \nand quantitative terms.  \n \n11.  Independent monitoring by a third party will be undertaken intermittently, starting in early \n2004 during the relocation and compensation payment for losses, and will continue throughout the \nProject. External monitoring will involve a review of overall resettlement as provided through the \ninternal monitoring system as well as direct field investigations and consultations with stakeholders \nto verify the results of internal monitoring. The tasks will include, among others, to (i) review \npreproject baseline data on APs; (ii) identify of a set of indicators for assessing resettlement \nimpact;  (iii)  use  various  formal  and  informal  surveys  for  impact  analysis;  and  (iv)  assess \nresettlement efficiency, effectiveness, and impact and sustainability. Problems identified will be fed \nback into the ongoing resettlement implementation to improve the process.  \n \nC.  Short Resettlement Plans \n \n12.  Short RPs have been prepared for four subprojects - Muang Xai4, Vang Vieng, Pakxanh, \nand  Xam  Neua  in  accordance  with  the  RF  (para.  2-10).  For  Phonsavan,  no  resettlement \ncomponents were envisaged since the town improvements will be confined to the existing rights-of-\nway and the solid waste site, which is government-owned, will not cause any person to lose assets \nor income. From the feasibility studies under the project preparatory technical assistance, the need \nfor resettlement appears minimal, and project activities proposed under the subprojects have been \ncarefully screened to assess any potential hardships that will be inflicted on the local population. \nThe total number of affected families in the four towns is 39, of which only 3 families need to be \nrelocated to allow for the construction of a bridge in Xam Neua. In Pakxanh 25 families, will be \n                                                 \n4 Xai is not included in the first batch of towns; however, a resettlement plan has already been prepared on the basis the \nproposed subproject, and will be updated when the town is admitted into the Project.    ", "46  Appendix 8   \nmarginally affected by the loss of 70 square meters each from their garden necessary for the \nconstruction of a small flood protection bank. Construction of a solid waste disposal site in Xay will \nnecessitate 6 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and affect a community of 10 farmers cultivating the \narea,  while  the  sanitary  landfill  site  in  Vang  Vieng  will  require  another  5  ha  owned  by  the \nGovernment. The cost of resettlement and land acquisition is estimated at $42,000 in the four \ntowns. In all, compensation will be provided for land replacement (6.2 ha), building replacement (4 \nhouses), loss of standing crop, relocation and subsistence allowance, land preparation costs, \nrehabilitation and income restoration costs, and costs for management, monitoring, and evaluation. \nCost estimates will be annually adjusted based on the inflation rate in the previous year.  \n \n13.   Muang Xai: Land acquisition will be needed for a solid waste disposal site. The new site, \n16 kilometers (km) from town, is proposed because the current disposal site infringes on a major \nroad  and  its  proximity  to  a  nearby  river  raises  major  environmental  concerns  such  as \nleakage/seepage and contamination. Other technically viable sites had significant resettlement \nimplications. The project will affect swidden farmers of 6 ha agricultural land. The farmers have \ncustomary rights to the terrain and will therefore be compensated for their loss by being given \naccess to land at least equal in size and productivity. The farmers will also receive compensation \nfor land preparation of approximately $2,587.  \n \n14.  Vang Vieng: Construction of a new, technically and environmentally suitable site for solid \nwaste disposal will take place on government-owned land about 7 km south of Vang Vieng. The \nsite (5 ha) is currently occupied by an ethnic Lao Leum farmer, who cultivates rainfed rice. \nAlthough the AP is using the land without the knowledge or permission of district authorities, he will \nbe compensated in cash for loss of standing crops in an amount equal to the net annual revenue \nfrom the parcel of land, estimated at $100 per ha for a total of $500. All other civil works including \nstorm water drainage and road improvement works will have no resettlement consequence.  \n \n15.  Pakxanh: The villages of Sivilay and Souansavan in Pakxanh are flooded yearly around \nAugust, when the Xanh River reaches its peak flow, bringing village life to a stop and school \nclosures. Flood protection works will  consist of extending a flood bank 600 meters (m) and \nelevating a public road by 50 centimeters over a distance of 450 m. The extended flood bank will \nbe constructed as a footpath, which requires acquisition of 1,800 m2 of land from 25 families. The \naverage loss is 70 m2 per family, which will be duly compensated at approximately $10,800. The \nfamilies welcomed the flood protection work as it will end the annual flooding and increase property \nvalue. \n \n16.  Xam Neua: A bridge to shorten market access to the town for the rural population and to \nlink the two parts of the towns along both sides of the river will be constructed in Xam Neua. It will \nrequire (i) relocation of three families to a site close to their present place of residence and (ii) 100 \nm2 of land on the northern side of the river and 300 m2 of agricultural and residential land on the \nsouthern side of the river. All APs were interviewed and consulted under the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance and by the district office staff. Besides bridge construction, no other project \nactivities will affect the town residents or the ethnic minorities; one of the households was headed \nby a female. Affected families will be given land on the eastern side of the Neua River, adjacent to \nthe land they presently own. Compensation will include three wooden one-story houses and one \ncommercial  structure  at  170  square  feet  (approximately  $13,600),  relocation  and  subsistence \nallowance for three families ($1,020), rehabilitation and income restoration measures including \nwater connections and electricity for the three affected families ($1,600).

General \n \n1.  Economic and financial analyses conducted under the project preparatory technical \nassistance were reviewed and revised in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector \nProject.   Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were computed for major subcomponents in \neach of the pilot small town subprojects following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis \nof  Projects.    Financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  determined  for  the  income-\ngenerating  subcomponents  of  the  Project,  and  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  urban \ndevelopment  administration  authorities  (UDAAs)  to  be  established  under  the  Project  was \nassessed,  based  on  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank.  \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n2.  The  estimated  costs  and  benefits  of  the  major  subprojects1  were  valued  at  their \neconomic prices using the  domestic price numeraire, which adjusts border price equivalent \nvalues  to  their  equivalent  domestic  prices  and  entails  the  application  of  shadow  price \nadjustments to convert the estimated financial costs to their equivalent. The shadow price \nadjustment factors used follows:  (i) foreign costs, 1.11; (ii) unskilled labor, 0.50; (iii) skilled \nlabor, 1.00; and (iv) local materials, 1.00.2  Capital and recurrent costs, inclusive of physical \ncontingencies, in constant 2002 prices were converted into economic costs by subtracting all \ntransfer payments, including taxes and duties, and applying the appropriate shadow price \nadjustment factors.   \n \n1.  Road Improvements and Drainage Works  \n \n3.  Road improvements and drainage works constitute approximately 28% of the estimated \nproject cost. About 145,800 m2 of road surfacing; 90,000 m2 of road pavement construction and \nreconstruction, 50,000 m2 of road widening, and 22,000 m2 of footpath paving will be involved. \nDrainage works corresponding to these road improvements will also be  undertaken. Street \nlighting  on  over  1,150  existing  poles  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  townwide  urban \ninfrastructure upgrading. At the village level, approximately 50,000 m2 of main access roads with \ndrainage  will  be  constructed,  partly  using  in-kind  labor  contributions  from  the  community. \nCentral and secondary roads will also be improved in 60 villages, representing about half of the \ntotal estimated number of villages in the targeted 10 towns.   \n \n4.  Road improvements and drainage works in the participating small towns will contribute \nsignificantly to the improved economic welfare of the town residents. Anticipated economic \nbenefits  were  quantified  by  determining  the  incremental  increase  in  the  valuation  of  land \naffected  by  the  subprojects.3  In  the  absence  of  sales  data  or  regular  property  valuation \nprocedures in the Lao PDR, local municipal officials in the pilot towns were asked to assess the \nprobable increase in land valuation. The results indicated considerable optimism; adjustments \nfor a more conservative approach yielded land valuation increases ranging from 67 to 153%, on \nbase values estimated at KN300 million to KN900 million per hectare. \n                                                                 \n1   In accordance with ADB\u2019s Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector \nProjects, smaller subprojects scattered throughout the participating small towns such as market and bus station  \nimprovements, as well as village infrastructure upgrading were not subjected to a detailed EIRR analysis, but were \nexamined using the cost-effectiveness criteria.   \n2  These adjustment factors are consistent with those used in other ADB-funded projects of a similar nature in Lao \nPDR such as the Vientiane Urban Infrastructure and Services Project , which was approved in 2001. \n3 An alternative approach using vehicle operation cost (VOC) savings is more suited to larger urban areas with \nheavier road traffic such as Vientiane.  ", "58 Appendix 14 \n \n5.  The major indicators of the economic viability of the proposed road improvements and \ndrainage works in the pilot town subprojects are summarized in Table A14.1. Calculated base \ncase EIRRs varied from 19.26% to 27.50%, exceeding ADB\u2019s 12% economic opportunity cost of \ncapital (EOCC), and confirming the economic robustness of the proposed subprojects. Analysis \nof sensitivity to some parameters? including a 10% increase in costs (likely to result from \ndelayed or prolonged implementation and inflationary factors), a 10% decrease in benefits \n(likely to result from poor quality implementation), and delays in the realization of benefits (likely \nto be caused by failure to establish efficiently functioning town UDAAs on time)? showed that \nthe EIRRs will be most vulnerable to changes in the anticipated benefits, i.e., increases in land \nvaluation. Subproject costs will have to increase by 42.9-75% for the EIRRs to drop to the \nEOCC; the same impact will be achieved with benefits decreasing by 32.9-60.6%. Adverse \nforeign exchange movements of the kip will also affect the EIRRs. The economic analysis \nrevealed that if the kip depreciates by 36.3-79.7% the base case EIRRs will drop to 12%.  \n \nTable A14.1:  Economic Evaluation of Road Improvements and Drainage Works \n \n         \nBase Case/Sensitivity Scenarios  Pakxhan  Phonsavanh  Vang Vieng  Xam Neua \n         \nFinancial Cost  5,810  6,757  7,399  5,032 \n          (KN million)         \nNet Present Value (NPV)  4,115  6,683  3,029  4,235 \n          (KN million)         \nBase Case EIRR (%)  23.72  27.50  19.26  25.56 \nSensitivity Test         \n          Case 1: Capital cost + 10%         \n               EIRR (%)  21.83  25.43  17.57  23.58 \n               Switching Value  61.9  75.0  42.9  68.5 \n               Sensitivity Indicator  1.62  1.33  0.17  1.65 \n          Case 2: O&M + 10%         \n               EIRR (%)  23.47  27.24  18.94  25.29 \n               Switching Value  476  590  224  506 \n               Sensitivity Indicator  0.21  0.17  0.45  0.20 \n          Case 3: Benefits < 10%         \n               EIRR (%)  21.3  24.94  17.05  23.09 \n               Switching Value  49.8  60.6  32.9  55.0 \n               Sensitivity Indicator  2.01  1.65  3.04  1.82 \n          Case 4: Benefits Delayed by 1 year         \n               EIRR (%)  19.48  22.47  15.86  20.95 \n               NPV (KN million)  2,889  5,015  1,752  3,091 \n               % Drop in NPV  29.8  25.0  42.2  27.0 \n          Case 5: Combination of cases 1 and 2         \n               EIRR (%)  19.25  22.73  15.12  20.96 \n               NPV (KN million)  2,612  4,745  1,336  2,871 \n               % Drop in NPV  36.5  29.0  55.9  32.2 \n          Case 6: 10% adverse forex movement         \n               EIRR (%)  21.55  25.18  17.26  23.86 \n               Switching Value  54.0  66.8  36.3  79.7 \n               Sensitivity Indicator  1.85  1.5  2.76  1.25 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance \n \n2.   Storm Water Drainage and Flood Protection Works \n \n6.  Storm water drainage and flood protection works account for 6% of the total project cost \nestimates. In the targeted small towns, storm water drainage consisting of both surface and \nunderground drains will be constructed in conjunction with the proposed road improvements. \nThese works are primarily aimed at decreasing the incidence of flooding in small towns, thereby \nreducing flood-related damages to life and property and decreasing the potential for the spread \nof waterborne diseases. The essentially small-scale nature of these storm drainage works does \nnot require a detailed economic evaluation. Reliance is mainly on the least-cost criteria and the ", "                                                                                                                Appendix 14          5   9            \npreviously established economic viability of ongoing drainage projects in Vientiane.4 However, in \nthe pilot town of Pakxhan, a major flood protection subproject with base cost of $176,000 is \nproposed for Sivilay village, and along the bank of the Mekong River, near the floodgate \ndownstream of the town. The economic benefits from the proposed flood protection works were \nquantified by assessing the potential savings arising from reduced physical damages to the \nflood-prone properties in the town, including buildings. Local officials and villagers indicated that \nflooding occurs every other year in the town, and that the costs of repairs and minor flood control \nefforts translated to an annual rate of about 10% of the affected property values (roughly \nassessed to have an average base value of KN300 million per hectare).5 Crop damages were \nalso estimated at KN 2.328 billion per hectare of irrigated rice at 50% annually.6 Allowance was \nmade for the unit benefit to rise by 6% per annum, in line with the forecast growth in the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita of the Lao PDR. The resulting base case EIRR was 33.68%, \nhigher than ADB\u2019s 12% EOCC, and demonstrating the considerable economic contribution of the \nproposed  subproject  to  both  the  urban  and  rural  surrounding  villages.  Sensitivity  analysis \nsuggested that the EIRR would also be  vulnerable to changes in the anticipated benefits from \nthe subproject. Capital costs will have to increase by 103.8%, while benefits will require only a \nreduction of 89.0%, for the EIRR to drop to 12%.    \n \n3.  Other Nonquantified Benefits \n \n7.  The road improvements and drainage subprojects will generate additional benefits that \nare not readily quantifiable:  (i) reduced damage to motor vehicles, (ii) savings in travel time, \nand (iii) safer conditions for both nonmotorized and pedestrian traffic.  The storm water drainage \nand flood protection works will (i) reduce personal income losses due to disrupted employment, \nand (ii) bring about environmental and health improvements, particularly as a result of the \nelimination of flooded and muddy streets during the wet season. In addition, vehicle parking, \nstreet lights, toilets, and drainage in selected public markets and bus stations in the participating \nsmall towns will contribute to improvements in the town\u2019s overall hygiene and health. Introducing \na solid waste management service in each town will pave the way for substantially cleaner town \nenvironments. Similarly, with appropriate and affordable septic waste treatment proposed for \neach town, environmental pollution will diminish. The livelihood promotion subcomponent will \nprovide  additional  income  opportunities  and  will  partly  induce  capital  accumulation  in  the \nvillages, thereby contributing to poverty reduction.  \n \n8.  Overall, the Project will stimulate critical backward and forward linkages in the economy \nby improving the basic infrastructure services of small towns that are strategically linked to the \nrural hinterland. Moreover, the Project will facilitate enhanced access to basic services such as \nhealth, education, and social welfare in the small towns, and thus contribute to the productivity \nand general well-being of the local residents. The detailed economic evaluation of the proposed \nsubprojects in the pilot towns is presented in Supplementary Appendix F.   \n \nC.  Financial  Analysis \n \n9.  The FIRRs were prepared for the revenue-generating subcomponents:  (i) solid waste \nmanagement, and (ii) septage disposal. Table A14.2 presents the major indicators of the \nfinancial viability of the solid waste management subprojects in the pilot towns. All base case \nFIRRs of 8.69-13.22% exceeded the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which was \n                                                                 \n4  Under the Vientiane Urban Infrastructure and Services Project (VUISP), economic evaluation conducted on the \ndrainage subcomponent resulted in an overall  base care EIRR of 11.9% with individual subproject EIRRs ranging \nfrom 6 to 29%. The lowest return was for a small  individual subproject whose benefits from improved connectivity \nto the drainage network could not be fully reflected in the analysis.   \n5  This is considerably higher than the 1% used under the VUISP. The higher ratio of property damages used in this \nanalysis can be traced to the significantly lower average property values in the small towns.  \n6  Based on the Feasibilty study for the ADB-funded Irrigation Management Transfer Project in the Lao PDR (1999).  ", "60 Appendix 14 \ncalculated at 4.3%.7  Sensitivity tests indicated that, on the average, the FIRRs will be most \nsusceptible to a reduction in the projected revenues or user charges and fees to be collected. \nCapital costs will have to increase by 28.8-49.4% for the base case FIRRs to drop to  the \nWACC; alternatively, projected revenues will have to decline by 18.4-28.6%. The FIRRs are \nalso  responsive  to  adverse  movements  in  the  kip  foreign  exchange  rate.  A  19.5-30.8% \ndepreciation of the kip will jeopardize the financial viability of the solid waste management \nsubprojects. Nonetheless, with the improved macroeconomic prospects of the Lao PDR, the kip \nis expected to demonstrate increased stability against the US dollar in the medium term. \n \nTable A14.2:  Financial Evaluation of Solid Waste Management Subprojects \n \n         \nItem   Pakxhan  Phonsavanh  Vang Vieng  Xam Neua \n         \nBase Case FIRR (%)  9.87  13.22  8.69  10.28 \nNet Present Value (NPV)  1,445  2,545  1,098  1,399 \n          (KN million)         \nSensitivity Test         \n          Case 1: Capital cost + 10%         \n               FIRR (%)  8.32  11.41  7.17  8.48 \n               Switching Value  36.0  49.4  28.8  33.2 \n               Sensitivity Indicator  2.78  2.03  3.47  3.01 \n          Case 2: O&M + 10%         \n               FIRR (%)  9.37  12.45  8.18  9.67 \n               Switching Value  111.6  116.5  87.0  98.1 \n               Sensitivity Indicator  0.21  0.86  1.15  1.02 \n          Case 3: Benefits < 10%         \n               FIRR (%)  7.45  10.10  6.30  7.41 \n               Switching Value  23.0  28.6  18.4  20.8 \n               Sensitivity Indicator  2.01  3.50  5.44  4.80 \n          Case 4: Benefits Delayed by 1 year         \n               FIRR (%)  7.14  9.37  6.15  7.14 \n               NPV (KN million)  209  1,598  495  728 \n               % Drop in NPV  86  37  55  48 \n          Case 5: Combination of cases 1 and 2         \n               FIRR (%)  5.14  7.18  3.99  4.66 \n               NPV (KN million)  74  825  (78)  86 \n               % Drop in NPV  95  68  107  94 \n          Case 6: 10% adverse forex movement         \n               FIRR (%)  7.59  10.32  6.44  7.59 \n               Switching Value  24.5  30.8  19.5  22.2 \n               Sensitivity Indicator  4.09  3.25  5.12  4.50 \nFIRR = financial interest rate of returns, O&M = operation & maintenance \n \n10.  All septage disposal subprojects in the pilot towns were found to be financially viable, \nwith base case FIRRs of 7.28-11.95%. Capital costs will have to escalate by as much as 17.2-\n147.5%, and revenue collections from user fees will have to drop by 12.9-110.3% for the FIRRs \nto decline to the calculated WACC of 4.3%. A summary discussion of the financial evaluation \ncarried out for all revenue-generating subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nD.  Affordability and Willingness To Pay \n \n11.  The latest poverty assessment of the Lao PDR8 analyzed the rural-urban difference in \nthe incidence of the poor and estimated that 27.65% and 43.27% of the urban population in the \n                                                                 \n7  In computing the WACC, a 6.7% nominal rate was used for  the ADB subloans to the pilot towns, while government \nfunds carried a nominal rate of 8% based on statistics from the Ministry of Finance on the ratio of the Lao PDR\u2019s \ntotal debt service to its total public debt.   \n8  See Statistical Analysis of Poverty in the Lao PDR prepared by the National Statistical Center of the Lao PDR in \ncooperation with the Asian Development Bank, in ADB 2001, Participatory Poverty Assessment, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Manila.   ", "                                                                                                                Appendix 14          6   1            \ncentral and northern regions, respectively, lived below the poverty line.  In the central region \nwhere three of the four pilot towns are located, the 1997/98 poverty line was calculated to be \nKN23,637 per capita per month (equal to KN132,367 per month per household given the \naverage household size of 5.6 persons in the pilot towns). In the northern region, where the pilot \ntown of Xam Neua is located, the 1996/98 poverty line was established at KN23,749 per capita \nper month (equal to KN142,494 per household per month given the town\u2019s average household \nsize of 6).9 Adjusting these poverty lines to 2002 levels using annual inflation indices resulted in \nthe following: KN475,976  ($50) per month per household in the central region, and KN512,390 \n($54) per month per household for the northern region. These figures appear to be sufficiently \nclose to the government\u2019s10 definition of poverty threshold, which is KN100,000 per capita per \nmonth or KN560,000 ($59) to KN600,000 ($63) per household per month.   \n \n12.  Poverty surveys undertaken during the project preparatory technical assistance revealed \nthree categories of urban poor in the targeted towns: (i) the ultra poor whose incomes are less \nthan KN200,000 ($21) per household per month, (ii) the medium-poor whose incomes ranged \nfrom KN201,000 to KN400,000 ($22-$42) per household per month, and (iii) the upper-level \npoor with monthly household incomes between KN401,000 and KN600,000 ($42-$63). Urban \nhouseholds of this type, which comprise the 30th to the 45th percentiles of income distribution in \nthe targeted towns, usually spend about 60% on food items, 10% on housing,  about 9-14% on \ntransport and communications, and the rest on education, recreation, personal care and other \nexpenditure items. The average monthly household income in the central region towns is \napproximately KN860,000 ($90); in the northern region towns, the average household income \nappears to be lower at KN675,000 per month ($71).11 \n \n13.  Cost recovery for investments under the Project and revenue generation by the UDAAs \nto be established in the small towns will require that the residents pay additional and higher user \ncharges and fees, including those for solid waste collection, septage disposal, and surcharges \non water and electricity. These charges and fees to be imposed will account for about 1.7-2.6% \nof the average household income in the targeted towns. At the 30th to the 45th percentiles of \nthe targeted towns, the charges and fees will constitute 3.1-4.0%  of  monthly  income.  To \naddress affordability concerns among the poor, differential pricing between commercial and \nresidential users will be adopted, allowing cross subsidization to occur. Community leaders and \nresidents, who expressed their demand for the urban infrastructure services to be provided, also \narticulated their willingness to pay for the services under a village contracting mechanism where \nthe poor will be charged according to their ability to pay.12 Levying the charges and fees based \non consumption patterns and using progressive rates will also ensure that the burden of taxation \nfor urban infrastructure services is appropriately skewed toward those who can better afford to \npay. And finally, based on the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 1997/98 (LECS 2), the \nroad improvements subprojects, which will provide the much-needed accessibility for the urban \nhouseholds residing in the small towns, will reduce household expense on food and transport by \n3-11% and 4-9%, respectively. \n \nE.  Financial Sustainability Of Small Town UDAAs \n \n14.  Ten-year financial projections prepared for the pilot towns confirm that with a properly \nphased and executed collection of urban-related user charges and fees, the UDAAs to be \nestablished under the Project will be able to meet, within 6 years of subproject appraisal, the \nprojected operational cost of providing urban infrastructure services as well as the cost of \nmaintaining existing and project-created public assets.  Lessons learned from relevant projects \n                                                                 \n9  These  poverty  lines  were  based  on  the  equivalent  income  needed  to  purchase  the  average  daily  caloric \nrequirements of the Lao population in the various regions plus some expenditure for essential nonfood items.   \n10 Through the State Planning Committee and the district authorities concerned. \n11  Based on 1998/99 monthly household income estimates of the Lao PDR regions (Chamberlain, J. 1999, The Social \nImpact of the Economic Crisis on Lao PDR.  \n12  This is particularly true for the solid waste management and septage disposal subprojects.   ", "62 Appendix 14 \nwere incorporated into the analysis, including the phased introduction of user charges and fees, \nstarting with those that are relatively easy to formulate and implement within the first 2 years, \nsuch  as  the  (i)  solid  waste  collection  fees,  (ii)  sanitation  charges,  (iii)  parking  and \nslaughterhouse fees, and (iv) business activity-related licenses and permits.  By the third year, \nadditional charges and fees will be levied, including the (i) consumption-based surcharges for \nelectricity and water supply, (ii) contributions to the road maintenance fund, and (iii) the urban \nobligation fees.13 Revenue projections for the four towns were based on this phased introduction \nof charges and fees (Table A14.3), combined with a gradual buildup of the UDAA\u2019s collection \nefficiency, in addition to networking activities with the Vientiane UDAA and the secondary towns \nUDAAs, to exchange lessons learned and accelerate the learning curve.  \n \nTable A14.3:  Summary of Proposed User Charges and Fees in the Four Pilot Towns \n \n  Summary of Charges and Fees To Be Collected \nUser Charge/Fee  Start of  Initial Rate  Rate of \nImplementationa  Residential  Commercial  Unit  Increase ($)c \n           \nSolid Waste Collection Fees  Year 1  4,650  16,800  KN/ton/month  2 \nSeptic Tank Cleaning Fees  185,000- 550,000-\nYear 1  KN/cleaning  2 \n200,000  600,000 \nWater Surcharge  Year 3  1,000    KN/month  2 \nElectricity Surcharge  Year 3  1,000    KN/month  0 \nParking Fees  Year 1  1,000    KN/parking  5 \nUrban Obligation Fees  Year 2  24,000  48,000  KN/year  3 \nRoad Maintenance Fund  Year 3  5    KN/liter  0 \nHotels/Guest Houses Room   \nYear 2  5,000  KN/room/month  10 \nTax \nSlaughterhouse Fees  Year 2    1,000-2,000  KN/animal killed  5 \na  From subproject appraisal \nb  Average based on the four towns \nc  In real term, allowance for inflation to be added \n \n \n15.  Grants from the central and provincial governments will finance the shortfall between the \nUDAAs\u2019  total  projected  revenues  and  expenses.  The  subsidies  are  deemed  justifiable \nconsidering the longer term province-wide and economy-wide net positive benefits that the \nProject will generate through urban infrastructure improvements that will no doubt also increase \nthe access of the rural hinterland to both employment and income opportunities.14 The UDAAs \nwill also contribute about $163,000 each to the Project, through subloans from the Government \nusing the ADB loan proceeds.15 Financial projections for the four towns indicate that the debt \nservicing requirements of these subloans will not impose an unduly heavy financial burden on \nthe UDAAs  (i.e., calculated debt service ratios ranged from 3.19 to 15.43).  The summary \nfinancial projections for the UDAAs of Pakxhan, Phonsvanh, Vang Vieng, and Xam Neua are \ndiscussed in Supplementary Appendix E. \n                                                                 \n13  These cost recovery policy reform measures were initiated by the Vientiane Urban Development Administration \nAuthority (VUDAA) as part of the ongoing Vientiane Urban Infrastructure and Services Project, making the process \nof replication easier. Urban obligation fee refers to the district obligation fee relating to buildings as stated in the \nDecision of the Governor of Vientiane Prefecture, dated 25 October 2000.   \n14  These subsidies are consistent with the principles outlined in ADB\u2019s guidelines on subsidies.  \n15  These  subloans  correspond  to  the  vehicle  and  equipment  cost  of  the  proposed  solid waste and septage \nmanagement improvements in each selected small town. UDAAs will have the capacity to repay these subloans \nthrough the imposition of user charges in the form of solid waste collection and septic cleaning fees.  The subloans \nwill carry an interest rate of 6.7% per annum, with a maturity of 15 years following subproject completion, including \na grace period of 3 years.  Contributions in kind from the villages and the UDAAs as well as the provinces will lower \nthese subloans.
