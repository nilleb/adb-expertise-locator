I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by Phu Bia Mining Limited, both \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject.1  \n2.  The project will improve the performance of provincial water utilities, called provincial nam \npapas (PNPs), and expand access to safe piped water supply and sanitation for urban residents \nin small towns in the Lao PDR. It will be financed by a sector loan as it meets the criteria in the \nsector lending policy of Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 It will contribute to the government\u2019s \nurban sector targets\u201490% coverage for piped water supply and 100% coverage for sanitation by \n2030\u2014by improving sector coordination and policy implementation in corporatization, improving \nnonrevenue  water  (NRW)  management  and  expanding  water  supply  in  provincial  towns, \ndeveloping new water supply systems in small towns, enhancing community action in urban water \nsupply and sanitation, and strengthening capacity for project implementation and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). The project will expand water and sanitation services to small district towns, \nprovincial capital towns and their peri-urban areas in accordance with the government\u2019s urban \nwater supply and sanitation strategy, 2013\u20132030 and water supply investment plan, 2012\u20132020.3   \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The project provides financing to corporatized PNPs for the development and expansion \nof water supply systems and village improvements to help reinforce links between sanitation \nand  health.  It  complements  existing  projects  by  further  strengthening  the  performance  of \ncorporatized PNPs through innovative approaches to NRW management, water safety plan \nimplementation, and O&M training through a water operator partnership. It demonstrates the \nbenefits of improved utility performance and efficiency on expanding water supply and sanitation \nservices to small district towns and peri-urban areas of provincial capital towns. It showcases \nADB as a finance++ bank through (i) its partnership with Phu Bia Mining Limited, which will \nprovide project specific cofinancing through its sustainability initiative, commonly known as \ncorporate social responsibility, and (ii) ADB\u2019s support to the government in strengthening its \nmechanism for coordinating development partners in the sector through output 1. \n4.  The Lao PDR population was estimated in 2011 at 6.4 million, of whom a third reside in five \nlarge urban centers and 150 small towns in 144 districts. Gross domestic product was estimated at \n$1,270 per capita in 2011 and $1,422 in 2012. The poverty rate declined to 28% in 2008 and is \nprojected to fall by one percentage point per annum.4 The development of urban centers and small \ntowns is important to improve living conditions and public health, strengthen urban\u2013rural linkages, \ngenerate employment, and narrow regional income disparities. Increased access to safe and \nreliable water and sanitation plays a vital role in the economic development of these towns. About \n58% of urban residents had access to piped water supply and 87% to improved sanitation in 2011. \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Phu Bia Mining Limited operates gold, copper, and silver \nmines in the Lao PDR, 90% owned by the ASX-200 listed company PanAust Limited, and 10% owned by the \nGovernment of the Lao PDR.

Ministry of Planning and Investment Statistical Yearbook 2011. Vientiane. Town \nclassification, now under review, has Vientiane as the capital, four secondary towns (with more than 20,000 people), \nprovincial or small district towns (with 4,000\u201320,000 people), and small towns (with fewer than 4,000 people). ", "2           \n5.  Urban water supply and sanitation sector in the Lao PDR used to lack sustainability and \neffective sector regulation. Transforming PNPs into profit-making corporatized business entities \nwas a challenge because of their limited institutional capacity. PNPs operated at a loss because \nof low tariffs, few water connections, and poor managerial and operational performance. This \nresulted in poor PNP technical and financial performance, poor service to consumers, and PNPs\u2019 \nreliance on the government for budget support.5 Since 2008, PNPs have corporatized under the \nEnterprise Law, 2005 and adopted a more business-like approach in line with the government\u2019s \nreforms for state-owned enterprises. The legal framework has improved with the approval of the \nWater Supply Law in 2009, the issuance of an urban water supply and sanitation strategy in 2013, \nand improved national and provincial sector regulation.  \n6.  ADB has supported the government improve its sector performance through three loans \nfor small towns that have (i) developed and rehabilitated 31 small town water supply systems; (ii) \napplied appropriate technology to the design of water supply systems; (iii) improved construction \nstandards  through  technical  support  to  construction  contractors  and  onsite  supervision;  (iv) \nimproved the operational and financial performance of PNPs through regular tariff adjustments \nand reduced arrears (7 of 16 PNPs have achieved full cost recovery, and 10 reduced arrears to \nless than 90 days in 2013); (v) made water supply affordable to poor and low-income households \nthrough a lifeline tariff; and (vi) increased water supply and sanitation coverage by requiring \nhouseholds to improve household latrines prior to receiving free household water connections.6 \nBy 2015, 12 more systems will be constructed and rehabilitated, and 10 PNPs will have corporate \nplans,  system-specific  service  agreements,  billing  and  accounting  systems,  and  asset \ndepreciation accounts. ADB technical assistance is supporting the government\u2019s strengthening of \nits regulations and facilitation of private sector participation in the water supply and sanitation.7  \n7.  Despite these impressive sector developments, NRW reduction needs to be prioritized, as \nhigh water losses in distribution networks adversely affect the efficiency and financial sustainability \nof water utilities and result in higher tariffs. In 2011, NRW for all 16 PNPs was estimated at 11.6 \nmillion cubic meters per year (m3/year) or 28% of water production. These figures understate the \nactual problem, as about half of the PNP systems provide intermittent supply. NRW would be \nmuch higher if the systems are pressurized.8 If current NRW could be reduced to around 20%, an \nadditional 3.3 million m3/year of piped water would be available to about 76,000 PNP customers, \nassuming consumption of 120 liters per capita per day. The project emphasizes efficient water \nuse and helps participating PNPs reduce NRW in provincial water supply systems while providing \ncapital investments for the provincial system and one small town system in the same province. \n8.  Water  supply  and  sanitation  in  peri-urban  areas  is  a  neglected  area  of  service,  as \nexpansion to these areas is often costly and technically challenging. In the Lao PDR, these areas \nare rapidly growing and becoming more densely populated, and they are home to about 60% of the \n                                                \n5   ADB. 2009.

The project provides investment to expand \nprovincial capital town water supply systems to peri-urban areas at a lower incremental cost than \ninstalling a new system. It will optimize investment efficiency and expand the PNP customer base. \nIt offers economies of scale, builds on established water supply systems, and enables tariff cross \nsubsidy between the provincial and small town water supply systems. \n9.  The project entails community-driven initiatives that complement the water and sanitation \ninfrastructure components to ensure that benefits reach the poor and vulnerable in each village. In \npast projects, community identification, prioritization for urban environmental improvements, and \ncommunity awareness were instrumental to addressing sanitation. These initiatives mobilized \nadditional government funds to extend improvements or develop complementary infrastructure.  \n10.  PNP  business  operations  can  be  strengthened  in  two  additional  areas:  customer \nrelations and water safety plans. One-third of PNPs have a complaints register, and a few report \ncomplaints regularly to their board. The project encourages PNPs to improve their services and \npartnership with communities regarding water conservation and water loss reduction through a \nPNP  customer  relations  manager. 9 The  focus  on  NRW  management  will  ensure  that \nbeneficiaries do not pay for PNP water losses. The free connection policy will minimize apparent \nlosses (commercial) by reducing the incentive for illegal or unauthorized connections. \n11.  Monitoring the quality of piped water, in accordance with the Ministry of Health\u2019s draft \ndrinking water quality standards, requires PNPs to prepare and implement water safety plans for \nall  systems.  Compliance  requires  sufficient  in-house  capacity  and  resources  to  test  all \nparameters. The project supports PNP implementation of water safety plans as part of their \nregular corporate planning updates, improving drinking water quality monitoring through a staged \napproach and raising awareness about compliance with standards. The application of water \nsafety plans will facilitate discussions on water security issues and on the multiple demands \nplaced on raw water sources. Limited protection and competing demands for raw water sources \ncauses poor water quality, water shortage, and system failure. Rapid urbanization, agriculture, \nindustry,  irrigation,  and  hydropower  development  pose  risks  of  possible  contamination  by \nwastewater, pesticides, and fertilizer, and of insufficient water flow downstream. The project \nincorporates these factors into the preparation of each subproject.  \n12.  The project aligns with the Lao PDR\u2019s Seventh National Socio-Economic Development \nPlan, 2011\u20132015, which envisions graduation from least-developed country status by 2020. It \ncontributes to the achievement of the Lao Millennium Development Goal targets for urban water \nsupply and sanitation by 2015. ADB\u2019s Lao PDR country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 and its \nLao PDR urban development assessment strategy and road map both emphasize stronger rural\u2013\nurban  linkages  through  improved  urban  services  and  municipal  infrastructure.  The  project \nincorporates lessons from ADB\u2019s independent evaluations and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u20132020 under Strategy 2020, which promotes working with corporate water \nutilities  to  strengthen  financial  management,  reduce  inefficiencies,  and  stabilize  water \nconsumption through robust demand management.10 The project supports the Ministry of Public \n                                                \n9   An information technology pilot activity to improve PNP\u2013client relations in the Lao PDR could be scaled up (ADB. \n2011.

ADB is a lead partner in urban water supply and \nsanitation in the Lao PDR. Other partners are Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, Bremen \nOverseas  Research  and  Development  Association,  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  China,  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  Korean  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Netherlands \nDevelopment Organization, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, Syndicat des Eaux \nd\u2019Ile de France through Groupe de Recherches et d'Echanges Technologiques, the Neighboring \nCountries  Economic  Development  Agency  (Thailand),  United  Nations  Human  Settlements \nProgramme, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, Water and Sanitation Program (World Bank), and \nWorld Health Organization.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  impact  will  be  expanded  access  to quality  and  reliable  piped  water  supply  and \nsanitation services for the urban population in the Lao PDR. The outcome will be improved \nperformance of participating PNPs in delivering sustainable water supply and sanitation services. \nThe proposed project is a sector lending project following a prioritized list of subproject towns \nbased on the water supply investment plan. It provides capital to selected PNPs that are state \n(or corporate) companies, have prepared a corporate plan, and have arrears at less than 90 \ndays. Each PNP will receive funds to expand and rehabilitate its provincial capital water supply \nsystem and to construct a new water supply system in a small town. Each town selected will \nhave 4,000\u201320,000 residents. The project supports about six PNPs improve and develop water \nsupply systems in about two towns per province. It is expected to improve access to water \nsupply for 155,000 people and improved sanitation for 160,000 people in these urban areas. \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The project will have the following five outputs. \n15.  Output  1:  Improved  sector  coordination  and  policy  implementation.  This  will \ncontinue reforms introduced under previous projects and implement new policy reforms to \nimprove the performance of about six PNPs. This includes (i) strengthened sector coordination, \nincluding support to help coordinate the subsector working group on water supply and sanitation \nunder  the  Technical  Working  Group  subgroup  on  urban  development,  subsector  biannual \nmeetings, annual subsector performance review with development partners, and smaller subsector \ncoordination  meetings;  (ii)  continued  implementation  of  policy  reforms,  including  service \nagreements between PNPs and provincial governments, PNP training on corporate planning and \nfinancial management, tariff adjustments, free connection policy, issuance of district sanitation \nregulations, and the use of simplified corporate plans; and (iii) expanded policy implementation, \nincluding nationalizing a free connection policy and sanitation regulations; wider coordination of \nNRW  management,  asset  management,  and  water  safety  plans;  and  the  establishment  of  a \ncorporate planning helpdesk in the project coordination unit.  \n16.  Output 2: Improved nonrevenue water management and water supply development. \nThis will integrate a comprehensive NRW reduction program with water supply development in \nabout five provincial capitals. The NRW program applies an integrated business approach that \nincludes both investment for physical works and support for surveys, water audits and balances, \nrecord drawings, and registers. It addresses both real losses (leakage) and apparent losses \n(metering losses and water theft). Participating PNPs will be required to establish permanent leak \ndetection  and  repair  teams  and  implement  disconnection  and  meter  management  policies. \nExperts will help these teams implement the NRW program. PNPs that participate in the NRW \nreduction program and the policy implementation activities under output 1 will be eligible to seek \n ", "5 \nfinancing for water supply rehabilitation and expansion of existing provincial systems to peri-urban \nareas. They will be eligible to receive O&M equipment and household connections and meters.11   \n17.  Output 3: Developed new water supply systems in small towns. Safe, affordable, \nreliable PNP piped water supply systems will be built in the core urban areas of about six small \ndistrict towns. PNPs that have agreed to participate in outputs 1 and 2 will be eligible for financing \nto build a new water supply system in a small district in the same province, acquire O&M \nequipment for it, and offer free connections and meters to households during construction.  \n18.  Output 4: Enhanced community action in water supply and sanitation. This will \nsustain the benefits from investments in small town water supply systems through complementary \nsanitation and awareness activities. The output includes (i) village environmental improvement \n(VEI) grants for core villages in a small town according to agreed eligibility criteria;12 (ii) improved \nhousehold sanitation for the poor;13 (iii) constructed or repaired public sanitation facilities where \nO&M  can  be  contracted  to  a  business  or  social  entity,  and  constructed  septage  disposal \nfacilities where they are unavailable in the subproject area; and (iv) increased project and \nhygiene awareness through stakeholder consultations and community participation, and water, \nsanitation, and hygiene behaviour change in areas such as water source protection. Activities \nwill be coordinated by district authorities and implemented by village development committees. \n19.  Output  5:  Strengthened  capacity  for  project  implementation,  operation,  and \nmaintenance.  This  will  include  support  for  project  implementation  assistance  and  capacity \ndevelopment, including safeguards and O&M. Each participating PNP will benefit from on-the-job \ntraining through a proposed water operators partnership with a regional water utility such as \nThailand\u2019s  Provincial  Waterworks  Authority. 14  The  output  supports  village  development \ncommittees in O&M of VEI infrastructure and includes incremental administration support for \nproject vehicles, project office equipment, and PNP operational and leak-detection equipment.  \nD.

The government has requested ADB to cover financing charges during \nimplementation.15 The government will cover taxes and duties, land acquisition and resettlement, \nincremental  administration  salaries  in-kind,  and  a  cash  contribution  for  output  4.  Project \ncommunities will also contribute cash for output 4.  \n22.  The government will relend to each participating PNP part of the proceeds from the ADB \nloan and the Phu Bia Mining Limited grant, equal to 30% of the capital investment costs of each \nPNP\u2019s  water  supply  system,  through  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  acceptable  to  ADB. The \n \nsubsidiary loans will have a maturity of 25 years with a grace period of 6 years, and a fixed \ninterest rate of 6.4% per annum. The balance of 70% of the cost will be provided from the same \nsources as a grant to each PNP.

Implementation Arrangements \n23.  Additional financing may be considered if the project performs well. If so, the original loan \nand grant, the preceding additional financing, or other finance will be used to achieve readiness \nfor the additional financing in such areas as design, safeguard requirements, and capacity. The \nmidterm review will determine whether the project is eligible for additional financing. \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe  project  administration  manual.16 Since  the  project  is  financed  with  ADB-administered \ncofinancing resources as well as ADF resources, universal procurement will apply to all contract \npackages financed under the project.17 \n                                                \n15  ADB will finance recurrent costs, local transportation, insurance, and bank charges to facilitate project implementation.  \n16  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  ADB. 2013.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  Technical due diligence for the project was based on the feasibility studies prepared for \nthree sample subproject towns: Pha Oudom, New Namtha, and Long. It assessed the suitability of \ntechnology used in water supply development, measures for energy efficiency and management, \ncontrols for NRW management, and technical viability and compatibility with local conditions for \nproposed VEI. The project adopts appropriately durable and sustainable technologies for water \nand sanitation improvements. It considers measures to ensure energy efficiency using least-cost \nanalyses. The current designs of water treatment plants suit specific site conditions; they are \nrobust and capable of handling a range of flows and raw water quality. They use gravity dosing of \nchemicals, hydraulic mixing of alum, horizontal sedimentation tanks, rapid gravity sand filters, and \nchlorination. The project includes initiatives to sustain low NRW, the free connections policy being \ndisincentives  for  unauthorized  connections  and  water  theft.  Engineering  solutions  for  VEI \ninfrastructure and equipment are selected for technical viability, compatibility with local conditions, \nand local O&M capacity. Household sanitation options will be selected for function, cost, long-term \ndurability, and suitability for local social norms.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Economic and financial analyses of subproject water supply components accord with ADB \nguidelines. The project contributes significantly to improved economic well-being in small towns in \nterms of resource cost savings and consumer satisfaction. The estimated economic internal rates \nof return of the three sample subprojects range from 15.39% to 20.00%, higher than the assumed \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12.00%. The estimated financial internal rates of return \nrange from 6.20% to 8.55%, higher than the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 5.14%. \nThe subprojects are most sensitive to implementation delays and decreased benefits or revenues, \nbut their estimated economic and financial internal rates of return remain above the economic \nopportunity cost of capital and the weighted average cost of capital under various scenarios. \n27.  Each PNP participating in the project will implement utility-wide tariffs that are sufficient to \nfully recover utility-wide O&M costs; recover utility-wide debt service; maintain a utility-wide debt \nservice ratio of at least 1.2 times once the project is operational; gradually recover an increasing \nproportion of annual depreciation expense of utility-wide fixed assets; and maintain customer \naccounts receivable at less than 90 days of annual sales. The proposed utility-wide tariffs can meet \nthe sector\u2019s financial objectives of cost recovery and debt service, indicating subproject financial \nsustainability. Affordability analyses of the three sample subprojects show the proposed tariffs to be \naffordable to domestic consumers. PNPs will be required to review and adjust their tariffs annually.  \nC.  Governance \n28.  Assessments of MPWT\u2019s financial management and procurement capacity and of the \nproject  coordination  unit  confirmed  that  project  implementation  arrangements,  which  follow \nprevious ADB water supply sector projects in the Lao PDR, are appropriate. The executing and \nimplementing agencies have experience in managing externally funded projects and sufficient \ncapacity to undertake international and national competitive bidding for civil works packages. The \nproject\u2019s focus on corporate planning and requirement for external audit of PNP financial accounts \nwill improve governance. Output 5 will strengthen the capacity of project staff and provide on-the-\njob  training.  The  project  coordination  unit  will  build  local  capacity  through  its  review  of \nprocurement and disbursement documents. It will hire a national accounting firm to assist with \nproject accounts and build capacity. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \n ", "9 \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MPWT. Specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 16).  \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The  project  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  health,  economic  prospects,  and  living \nconditions of town residents. It is gender category 2, effective gender mainstreaming. By 2021, the \nproject will benefit about 160,000 residents in 113 core villages in 11 small towns, including 5,000 \npoor urban households, or 15% of all households. It eliminates barriers to access for the urban \npoor and prioritizes poor districts (output 3). Health benefits will be derived through access to \nimproved drinking water; greater water availability for sanitation and personal hygiene; increased \naccess to improved sanitation and reduced open defecation; and improved septage management. \nGender benefits for women will result from greater convenience, reduced physical burden, and \ntime savings in water collection; improved family health; increased privacy and dignity when \ntending to sanitation needs; and greater hygiene information specific to women\u2019s health and \nmenstrual hygiene. The gender action plan furthers ADB\u2019s experiences in gender mainstreaming \nin the urban water and sanitation sector in the Lao PDR.18 \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The project is involuntary resettlement category B, as it will not entail significant land \nacquisition or resettlement. A resettlement framework and resettlement plans for the three sample \nsubprojects have been prepared. The resettlement framework will guide the preparation of the \nremaining resettlement plans once subprojects are identified. \n31.  The project is indigenous peoples categories B, as the three sample subprojects are in \nurban areas, where ethnic groups are likely to be well integrated into society and so indigenous \npeoples plans are not required. An indigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared to \nguide the assessment and preparation of an indigenous peoples plans, if necessary, once the \nremaining subprojects are identified during implementation. \n32.  The  project  is  environment  category  B.  The  project  includes  a  sound  approach  to \nmanaging  water  security  issues.  Subprojects  are  not  expected  to  cause  any  irreversible \nenvironmental impacts. An environmental assessment review framework, initial environmental \nexaminations for the project and three sample subprojects, and environment management plans \nhave been prepared. Potential impacts of climate change and natural hazards to the project have \nbeen integrated into initial environmental examinations with recommendations for detailed design. \nPotential adverse impacts during construction are expected to be temporary and can be mitigated \nby executing the environment management plans required in the bidding and contract documents.  \n33.  Safeguard documents have been prepared in consultation with local communities and \naffected people accord with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), sector requirements, and \ngovernment regulations and disclosed on ADB website. A grievance redress mechanism will \nfacilitate the resolution of complaints during project implementation. The project includes budget \nand  institutional  support  for  safeguard  document  preparation,  updates,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring. It includes provision for an external resettlement monitor. A project information booklet \nfor resettlement will be distributed to affected people during the detailed measurement survey. \nSafeguard documents have been approved by the government. Subproject plans will be updated \nafter detailed design, cleared by the government and ADB prior to contract award, and disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website according to ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements.  \n                                                \n18  See footnote 5, which includes a $500,000 grant from the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund. \n ", "10           \nF.
