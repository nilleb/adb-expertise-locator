The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the development of a submarine \noptical  fiber  cable  system  (SCS)  in  Solomon  Islands  where  access  to  affordable \ntelecommunications,  particularly  high-speed  (broadband)  internet,  is  low  because  of  the \ndependence on satellite connectivity.1 Once an SCS is established, wholesale bandwidth prices \nare expected to halve, leading to a conservatively estimated retail price reduction of 20%.  \n   \n2.  The SCS will impact most significantly the three large central island areas (Honiara, Auki, \nand Gizo). It is as yet unclear how the SCS will influence connectivity in the remote periphery \nislands. However, cell phone networks have grown rapidly following deregulation in 2010, and \nlocal practices for data dissemination have emerged. Cell phones can be an important conduit \nto broaden utilization of information and communication technology (ICT). The interest of cell \nphone companies in expanding the number of cell sites that can tap into microwave signals from \nan SCS presents an opportunity to increase connectivity to the outer islands.2 Solomon Islands \nalready has about 70% cellphone services coverage, which can provide useful lessons for the \nimplementation of an overall ICT plan.  \n \n3.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  examine  the  potential  contribution  of  ICT  to  the \neducation  sector  in  addressing  constraints  to  managing  and  delivering  services  to  widely \ndispersed and isolated schools in Solomon Islands.3 The TA activities and outputs are expected \nto facilitate future application of ICT to education management and service delivery. The TA will \ncontribute to more equitable service delivery, and increase benefits of the investments made \nthrough development of the SCS. The design and monitoring framework for the TA is presented \nin Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Education sector and information and communication technology. Solomon Islands \nis well placed to develop an ICT for Education (ICT4E) strategy, and is finalizing an overall ICT \npolicy and strategy. Within the education sector, a sector-wide approach supports coordination \nand policy dialogue between the Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development \n(MEHRD) and its development partners. MEHRD is also focused intensively on improvements \nto  the  Solomon  Islands  Education  Management  Information  System  (SIEMIS).  Under  the \nNational Education Action Plan, 2013\u20132015 (NEAP), MEHRD will establish an ICT division in \nearly 2014, and has engaged an on-demand advisor to analyze the requirements for SIEMIS \nimprovement and to train staff.   \n \n5.  Expansion of distance and flexible learning (DFL) will be an increased focus of the next \nNEAP, 2016\u20132018. In the current NEAP, 2013\u20132015, MEHRD has made a commitment to use \nsituated (workplace or school-based) learning through DFL on a large scale for the professional \ndevelopment of teachers nationwide. Several pilot ICT initiatives have been undertaken in the \npast and are perceived to have had mixed impacts. Typically, they have been conceived and \nimplemented as stand-alone pilot projects, often driven largely by external players and linked \nonly tenuously to MEHRD policy and strategic planning.  \n \n                                                \n1    ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant to \nSolomon Islands for the Broadband for Development Project. Manila. \n2   Two companies provide cell phone services in Solomon Islands: Solomon Telekom and Bemobile. Solomon   \nTelekom is a local company, while Bemobile is from Papua New Guinea. \n3    The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 October 2013. \n ", "2   \n6.  At the higher education level, the University of the South Pacific (USP) plans to develop \na new campus in Ndoma (with ADB support) where DFL programs will constitute an important \nelement of the USP program, demonstrating the potential contribution of ICT to provide quality \nlearning experiences that transcend national and geographic boundaries. USP is advanced in \nits distance learning strategy, and is pilot testing its second generation of tablet computing for \nstaff and students.  \n \n7.  Technology and applications at school level\u2014education management. Because of \nthe dispersed and remote islands, enhancing communication in Solomon Islands schools will \nnecessitate addressing a wide range of schools. ICT solutions will need to be developed on a \nschool-by-school basis. As the country moves toward planning systems for decentralization of \neducation services (targeted for December 2015), the success of the ICT plan is critical to \nimproving two-way communication between MEHRD and education authorities, and the schools.  \n \n8.  Identification of technology and applications will require the development of new systems \nto  ensure  that  the  use  of  these  technologies  produces  the  benefits  expected.  New \nadministrative systems and resources will need to be established so that education authorities \nand MEHRD can effectively manage and respond to improved communication with schools. \nUnder  decentralization  efforts,  head  teachers  and  communities  may  become  increasingly \naccountable  for  teacher  and  student  attendance.  Cell  phone  applications  will  need  to  be \ndeveloped for reporting this, and education authorities will need systems to record and respond \nto  the  information.  It  is  critical  that  the  new  systems  are  well  thought  out,  thorough,  and \nsustainable.  \n \n9.  Solomon Islands education management information system. An SIEMIS electronic \nentry system at the school level will increase data accuracy and eliminate the need for data \nentry at the provincial education authority level and central MEHRD levels. The reduction in the \nneed to transpose paper data into electronic form will allow SIEMIS to transition to a system in \nwhich students\u2019 names can be related to unique identifier numbers, allowing schools to track \ninformation on individual students. This will allow MEHRD to improve analysis of national data \nby disaggregation to identify trends and patterns that warrant further research and possible \ninterventions. Improvements in SIEMIS will allow an interactive system for sharing information to \nhelp  school  and  teacher  performance,  and  guide  MEHRD  and  education  authority  policy \ndevelopment and resource allocation. \n \n10.  Teacher management. MEHRD and education authority management of the teaching \nwork force is hampered by a lack of ability to verify data accuracy easily. Use of electronic \ntemplates  and  new  technology  will  allow  for  quick  reporting  of  information  on  enrollment \nnumbers, grade levels, and projected new enrollments at the beginning of the school year in \nFebruary, which will allow more accurate staff allocation. It will also allow for better management \nof teacher work load and equitable teacher\u2013student ratios; teacher salary calculations; and \nteachers\u2019 benefits such as accommodation allowances, leave, confirmation of progression in \nservice, and sick leave. Technology will also allow for monitoring of education authority or \nMEHRD response times to teacher queries, and developing strategies to improve services. \n   \n11.  Financial management. MEHRD is required to ensure appropriate usage of grants to \nschools to promote school-based management. In a largely cash economy, the risk of school \ngrants being misappropriated or used outside policy guidelines is high. Moreover, MEHRD\u2019s \nability to travel to schools to verify the use of funds is very limited because of low staff numbers \nand budget constraints. New technology, specifically using cell phones with built-in cameras, will \n ", "  3 \nallow receipts to be scanned and digitally stored, physical evidence to be photographed, and the \nschool grant execution form to be completed on an electronic template.  \n \n12.  Asset  management.  Under  the  NEAP,  MEHRD  will  improve  education  access  by \nensuring  that  classrooms  meet  minimum  standards  for  building  conditions  and  equipment. \nMEHRD has begun a survey of all schools to establish a baseline of conditions that will allow \nMEHRD to calculate the longer-term costs of maintaining infrastructure and new capital works. \nSuch information will need to be updated continually under a database for asset management, \nand quality of information will be crucial. With limited resources to visit all schools regularly to \nupdate and verify data, technology will allow development of templates for entering data on \nschool assets, which can then be electronically entered into the national asset management \ndatabase, avoiding consuming manual data entry systems. Built-in cameras can allow schools \nto send photographs if required.   \n \n13.  Technology  and  applications  at  school  level\u2013teaching  and  learning.  The most \nimmediate impact of the rollout of improved two-way communication between schools and \neducation authorities will be to improve effective management of education. Technologies and \napplications utilized will almost certainly have synergies with the NEAP objectives of improving \neducation access and quality. The TA will support desk studies to identify and explore currently \navailable  applications  relevant  to  education  management  needs.  However,  a  similar  and \nintegrated approach needs to be given on how to harness and build local capability to generate \nteaching and learning applications such as educational multimedia for transmission and transfer \nas podcasts. \n \n14.  An important feature of mobile devices is the integration of sound, visuals, text, and \noften sensory input and output in a single device. This has particular significance in Solomon \nIslands where there is widespread illiteracy and multiple local languages. Local repurposing of \ninternational  open-source  content  can  easily  be  done  by  replacing  audio  tracks  with \ncommentaries in vernacular languages. MEHRD can also benefit from programs developed \nelsewhere, including cell phone and short message service-based applications for literacy and \nnumeracy development, testing, and data collection, which are increasingly likely to be released \nunder Creative Commons licenses. Recently developed local content for curriculum and teacher \neducation is also available for repurposing under similar license arrangements.  \n \n15.  In remote communities, schools can play a role in supporting more holistic approaches \nto learning that look at the wider needs of children and community. The success of the schools \ninitiative may also open up opportunities for improved communication systems for health and \nsocial protection  in Solomon Islands, increased responsiveness in emergency situations, and \nother follow-on benefits at the local community level. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact will be improved management and delivery of education services, particularly \nat the periphery level, due to appropriate use of ICT. The outcome will be enhanced capacity of \nthe education sector in ICT application at subnational levels. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The TA will achieve the following outputs with key activities. \n ", "4   \n \n18.  Output 1: Development and implementation of a gender-inclusive ICT plan linking \nMEHRD,  provincial  education  authorities  and  schools.    MEHRD  is  developing  and \nimplementing  an  ICT  plan  focused  on  improving  efficient  and  cost-effective  links  between \nMEHRD at the central level and at the education authority level. The next phase of expanding \ntwo-way  communication  between  the  provincial  level  and  school  level  has  a  scope  and \ncomplexity that means MEHRD will require significant support. The development of an ICT plan \nfor two-way communication at the school level would require data gathering and field research \nat each educational institution to ensure that each school has a local solution based on a \nbottom\u2013up  approach,  surveys  of  existing  connectivity  and  ICT  use,  testing  of  options, \ndevelopment  of  communication  templates  and  applications,  administrative  systems \ndevelopment, and purchasing or subsidizing the purchase or use of cell and related devices.   \n \n19.  Output  2:  Identification  of  ICT  hardware  options,  development  of  suitable \napplications, and piloting their use in rural or remote areas, including capacity building. \nThis  output  aims  to  enhance  two-way  communication,  education  management,  teacher \nprofessional development support, teaching and learning resources, as well as capacity building \nfor ICT adoption at the school and school community levels. Following consultations between \nMEHRD, education authorities, teaching professionals, and school communities, a consensus \nwill be reached on priority areas where ICT can improve education management so it will have \nthe greatest impact on improving student learning outcomes. A mix of technologies\u2014including \ncell phones, tablets, and radio\u2014will be investigated to ensure these priority applications can be \nimplemented and are the best options for the local school context. Priority areas may include \nreporting  upward  and  downward,  for  example  on  student  and  teacher  presence,  school \ndisruptions,  ministry  announcements,  results,  managing  teacher  salary  and  entitlement \nrequirements, SIEMIS data collection, public finance management requirements, verification of \ninformation, dissemination of teacher support resources, learning materials, and resources to \npromote inclusive education practices. As part of the rollout of these applications, schools will \nbe supported to undertake a capacity analysis so school communities can take advantage of \nthese technologies. A range of modalities will be available for capacity development on ICT \napplications and usage that best suits the local context and reaches all relevant stakeholders in \nthe school community. \n \n20.  Output 3: Comprehensive assessment study conducted on how enhanced access \nto ICT can add value to the DFL. This includes identification of constraints and opportunities \nwithin the education sector. The assessment study will help prepare the groundwork for an \neventual national level ICT4E strategy ready for implementation in the 2016\u20132018 NEAP. This \nwill be aligned with the National ICT Strategy and National ICT Policy, which are being drafted. \nThe study will draw on the experience of existing ICT initiatives in Solomon Islands and global \nbest practices, as well as the sector assessment prepared for the Broadband for Development \nProject supported by ADB (footnote 1). The assessment will also include a gender analysis to \nensure gender-inclusive considerations in its recommendations.  \n \n21.  Output  4:  Convene  ICT4E  workshop  and  forum    to  raise  awareness,  identify \npotential and constraints, and share findings and lessons learned from the TA outputs. \nWorkshops  and  other  modalities  can  facilitate  critical  discussions  and  make  policy \nrecommendations  on  the  effective  role  of  ICT4E  in  Solomon  Islands,  which  will  lay  the \ngroundwork and road map for a more comprehensive sector plan for ICT in education under the \n2016\u20132018 NEAP.  \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of: \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury ICT support unit will be the executing agency. \nMEHRD  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  MEHRD  will  identify  a  responsible  officer  to \ncoordinate activities with the consulting firm and consultants. Training and technical support will \nbe implemented and administered by a consulting firm. ADB will support the selection and \nrecruitment of the consultant firm.  \n \n24.  The TA will require a total of 120 weeks of consultant services (40 weeks international \nand  80  weeks  national).  A  consulting  firm,  in  association  with  international  and  national \nconsultants,  will  be  engaged  following  the  fixed  budget  selection  process  and  simplified \ntechnical proposals by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). In case of difficulty in finding a qualified firm, individual selection \nwill apply for consulting services. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, \nas amended from time to time). The firm and consultant inputs will be on an intermittent basis, \nresponding to government requirements and progress made during implementation. The outline \nterms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over \n24 months  commencing  on  1  April  2014  after  MEHRD  commences  the  first  phase  of  the \nMEHRD ICT plan and terminating on 31 March 2016.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Solomon Islands to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge  Partnership  Fund  for  Information  and  Communication  Technology  for  Better \nEducation Services and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets \n  and Indicators with  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary   Baselinesa  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2018:  SIEMIS data  Assumption \nImproved  Increased practical usage    The government continues to \nmanagement and  and application of ICT in  ICT Support Unit reports   recognize the importance of \ndelivery of education  education information    ICT in education in national \nservices, particularly  management and service  MEHRD reports   development \nat the periphery level,  deliveryb at the provincial     \ndue to appropriate  and school level  Provincial reports  Risks \nuse of ICT      Political and economic risks to \n  School reports  maintaining adequate \n  government support to the \n  education sector \n   \n  Human resource staffing and \ncapacity is weak \nOutcome  By Q1 2016  SIEMIS data  Assumption \nEnhanced capacity of  Provincial education    Government support for ICT-\nthe education sector  authorities and schools  MEHRD reports  based improvement in \nin ICT application at  both use ICT applications    education sector remains a \nsubnational levels  that improve management  Provincial reports  priority at the subnational level \n  and access to education     \n  services  School reports  Risk \n    Ongoing education service \n  delivery challenges and \nconstraints preoccupy \nministries, and ICT-based \napplications are regarded as \nlow priority \nOutputs  By Q2 2015   MEHRD reports  Assumption \n1.
