INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will improve the environmental and \nsocial safeguards capacity of executing and implementing agencies of developing member \ncountries (DMCs) covered by the Southeast Asia Regional Department (SERD) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).1 This will be accomplished by improving the focus on the quality of the \ndesign and implementation of projects with respect to safeguards compliance through (i) on-the-\njob training (OJT) of executing and implementing agencies, (ii) timely identification of gaps \nbetween local practice and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and (iii) development of a \nstrategy to effectively bridge these gaps. \n \n2.  This TA will aid DMCs in Southeast Asia in attaining inclusive growth and meeting the \nSustainable Development Goals, while protecting the environment and poor and vulnerable \npeople  during  the  development  process.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement, which aims to promote the sustainability of project outcomes by protecting the \nenvironment and people from potential adverse impacts of projects, and is in line with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 operational priority on strengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Safeguards policies are essential to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts to people and \nthe environment during the development process. DMCs have responded to emerging social and \nenvironmental challenges but face continuing challenges as they seek to (i) prevent further \nimpoverishment resulting from environmental degradation and involuntary resettlement, and (ii) \nacknowledge  the  special  needs  of  indigenous  people  and  other  vulnerable  groups  in  the \ndevelopment process. ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement seeks to avoid, minimize, or mitigate \nadverse environmental and social impacts, including by protecting the rights of those likely to be \naffected or marginalized by the development process. \n  \n4.  Project  executing  and  implementing  agencies  play  the  critical  role  in  successfully \nmanaging environmental and social safeguards during project preparation and implementation. \nBorrowers  in  ADB-financed  projects  are  responsible  for  assessing  projects  and  their \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts,  preparing  safeguard  plans,  and  engaging  with  affected \ncommunities  through  information  disclosure,  consultation,  and  informed  participation  in \naccordance with the policy principles and safeguard requirements outlined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  borrower  is  required  to  submit  all  required  information,  including \nassessment reports, safeguard plans and frameworks, and monitoring reports, to ADB for review \nwhile complying with host country laws, regulations, and standards, including host country \nobligations under international law. Further, the borrower must implement safeguard measures \nas agreed with ADB to deliver the policy principles.  \n \n5.  Implementation issues have been identified which frequently lead to project delays, \nincluding:  (i)  delayed  finalization  of  safeguards  documents  after  completion  of  engineering \ndesigns; (ii) a lack of or untimely preparation and finalization of corrective actions; (iii) delayed \npayment of compensation and assistance to displaced persons; (iv) insufficient meaningful \nconsultations  with  affected  persons  and communities;  and (v)  inefficient grievance  redress \nmechanisms. The principal challenge is the weak institutional capacity of government agencies \n                                                \n1  SERD covers ADB operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \nThe TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019S website on 3 October 2018.  \n2  ADB. 2018.

Inadequate technical skills and lack of oversight and \nmonitoring of safeguards during project implementation often leads to delays and cost overruns. \nPoor safeguards planning and implementation can often be linked to (i) treatment of safeguards \nas an external or secondary factor in project development; (ii) the priority given to civil works \nschedules; and (iii) inadequate executing agency staffing, combined with high turnover of trained \nsafeguards staff. In these circumstances, safeguards planning and execution are not systematic, \n \nslowly executed, or a source of complaints. \n \n6.  ADB has 157 sovereign projects in Southeast Asia, with an overall portfolio size of $16.6 \nbillion across seven DMCs, excluding projects classified as regional. Table 1 summarizes the \nsafeguards  categorization  of  projects  under  implementation,  and  Table  2  summarizes  the \nsafeguards categorization of projects under preparation.    \n \nTable 1: Safeguards Categorization of Projects under Implementation \n \nDMC  Environment  Environment  Involuntary  Involuntary  Indigenous  Indigenous  Total \nCategory A  Category B  Resettlement  Resettlement   Peoples  Peoples \nCategory A  Category B  Category A  Category B \nCambodia  0  28  2  18  0  12  32 \nIndonesia  1  11  3  9  1  5  17 \nLao PDR  0  19  2  13  0  16  27 \nMyanmar  0  12  0  8  0  8  14 \nPhilippines  0  8  1  5  4  3  14 \nThailand  0  2  0  1  0  0  2 \nViet Nam  7  33  20  17  4  23  52 \nTotal  8  113  28  71  9  67   \nDMC = developing member country, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates as of 31 August 2018. \n \nTable 2: Safeguards Categorization of Projects under Preparationa \n \nDMC  Environment  Environment  Involuntary  Involuntary  Indigenous  Indigenous  Total \nCategory A  Category B  Resettlement   Resettlement   Peoples  Peoples \nCategory A  Category B  Category A  Category B \nCambodia  0  8  0  6  0  6  8 \nIndonesia  1  1  0  1  0  1  5 \nLao PDR  0  4  0  4  0  4  5 \nMyanmar  0  3  0  3  0  2  3 \nPhilippines  0  2  1  1  1  1  4 \nThailand  0  1  0  1  0  0  1 \nViet Nam  1  6  2  5  0  8  10 \nTotal  2  25  3  21  1  22   \nDMC = developing member country, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \na  The projects under preparation are targeted for 2018 signing.

The  project  preparation  and  implementation  model  requires  a  consistent  approach, \nwhereby  design,  civil  works,  and  safeguards  are  effectively  coordinated,  and  projects  are \ndesigned to be environmentally and socially sound. Building the awareness and capacity of DMCs \nby  incorporating  international  good  standards  and  practices\u2014including  ADB  policies\u2014will \npromote and ensure responsiveness to mitigate potential adverse development impacts, including \nthrough protection of the environment and improvement in the living conditions of the affected \npeople. Improving the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies to implement social \n ", "  3 \nand environmental safeguards will improve development impact and increase implementation \nefficiency of all development projects by adopting international best practices in safeguards \nmanagement, minimizing implementation delays, helping to achieve timely disbursements, and \nreducing complaints from affected people. This will enhance overall safeguards performance and \nproject quality and help avoid delays stemming from the need to resolve grievances resulting from \npoor quality safeguards documents. \n \n8.  Capacity building is also needed to address gaps between country-specific laws and \npolicies on safeguards and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, as well as to respond to scenarios \nthat could potentially result in noncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement which \ncause negative impact and delay project implementation.  \n \n9.  A web-based safeguards tracking system, which may be adapted by DMCs, will enable \ntimely and effective monitoring of safeguards performance and the progress of ADB-financed \nprojects  in  Southeast  Asia.  Continuous  training  and  capacity  building  support  during \nimplementation is essential to remedy frequent staff turnover within executing and implementing \nagencies. The TA will provide needed support to executing and implementing agencies to \nstrengthen  their  safeguards  knowledge  and  capacity  to  implement  development  projects, \nincluding those financed by ADB. It will help streamline safeguards procedures, instruments, data \ncollection tools, and monitoring mechanisms throughout the region and provide an opportunity to \nshare knowledge and replicate best practices. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved protection of the environment and \npeople from the potential adverse impacts of projects. The TA will have the following outcome: \nimproved social and environmental safeguards management and performance in ADB DMCs in \nSoutheast Asia.3 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Safeguards capacity of executing and implementing agencies improved. \nCustomized support solutions will be prepared to meet the environmental and social safeguards \nneeds and specific capacity gaps of the respective executing and implementing agencies in ADB \nDMCs in Southeast Asia. The international and national consultants will conduct sector-focused \ncapacity gap analysis, covering the institutional and implementation capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies. They will work in close consultation with ADB project officers at the sector \nand  country  level  and  with  counterpart  directors  and  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nspecialists  in  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  project  management  units,  project \nimplementation units, and other project-related staff placed at ADB\u2019s resident mission in each \nparticipating DMC. The TA will also support additional technical surveys and studies for problem \nsolving as required during project preparation or implementation. Executing and implementing \nagencies will be supported by the TA consultants during project preparation and implementation \nthrough on the job trainings. Advice will be provided to improve project screening and scoping, \nthe quality of safeguards assessments, and monitoring reports, and thereby reducing the number \nof reviews and time required for approval. This will strengthen the safeguards capacity of \n                                                \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4   \nexecuting and implementing agencies, and improve assessments and safeguards documentation \nquality. \n \n12.  The TA will complete the following activities: (i) review gaps identified between country, \nsector,  and  project-level  systems  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement;  (ii)  summarize \nsafeguards policies, laws, and regulations and indicate their degree of congruence with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards Policy Statement requirements; and (iii) recommend needed actions to fill gaps. Due \nconsideration will be given to any completed and ongoing TA work under Strengthening and Use \nof Country Safeguards Systems.4 Resettlement plans, indigenous peoples\u2019 plans (including ethnic \nminority  development  plans),  and  environmental  assessments  (including  environment \nmanagement plans) with significant impacts will be reviewed in consultation with the sector \ndivisions and country offices. The consultants will support the project teams in enhancing the \nplans  and  reviewing  the  planning,  implementation,  and  supervision  of  resettlement  and \nindigenous people\u2019s activities and environmental management. Training will be provided as \nneeded through visits to projects and OJT for counterpart staff and all stakeholders to enhance \nsafeguards implementation capacity and quality. \n \n13.  For problem solving, the TA will support liaisons with national social and environmental \nstakeholders to build existing networks and to promote better understanding of safeguards \nimplementation within DMCs. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Web-based  automated  system  for  tracking  safeguards  performance \ndeveloped. The safeguards performance tracking system will enable SERD\u2019s sector divisions \nand resident missions to input, check status and track progress on safeguards. The system can \nbe accessed both by resident missions and sector divisions. Over time, access will also be \nprovided to executing and implementing agencies. It will cover the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples; track the performance and progress of safeguard planning \nand implementation activities in projects; and assign different weights to key activities. Based on \nthe values assigned to each key activity, ADB safeguards specialists and the executing and \nimplementing agencies will be able to ascertain compliance by projects at different stages. With \nthe support of the Environment and Safeguards Division of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department, synergy will be built with existing ADB monitoring systems. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($1,190,000 from TASF 6 and $310,000 from TASF-other \nsources). The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, access to \ninformation and reports, and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. Individual consultants will be recruited through framework \nagreements wherein short-listed candidates may be hired as needed for the duration of the \nagreement to provide international and/or national consulting inputs as required. ADB will engage \nthe consultants and carry out procurement following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff \ninstructions.
