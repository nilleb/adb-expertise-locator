INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  provide  evidence-based \nsolutions for the development of the health care industry1 in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) \nregion of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).2 The TA will (i) provide a framework for improved \ncoordination of health care industry policies and regulations, and (ii) disseminate research results \nand international comparisons of health care development to policy makers.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and supports \noperational priorities 1 (poverty), 3 (climate change), and 6 (strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity) along with their corresponding operational plans.3 The TA is in line with the \nGovernment of the PRC\u2019s Healthy China Action Plan 2030, which advocates strengthening the \nhealth care industry in the PRC to meet its future health challenges.4 The TA is included in the \nlist of projects agreed upon between ADB and the Government of the PRC on 22 January 2020.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Although the PRC\u2019s health care industry is one of the world\u2019s largest, most pharmaceutical \nsales are domestic with 80% of the market focused on low cost generic drugs and 20% focused  \non complex and patented drugs, which are mostly imported and more expensive.6 The drugs are \nmostly purchased domestically by public hospitals and pharmacies, which account for a significant \nproportion of the PRC\u2019s state health budget. The PRC is also a major global producer of active \npharmaceutical ingredients required to develop more complex finished pharmaceutical products. \nHowever, the exportation of complex and innovative pharmaceutical products to international \nmarkets is less significant. About 97% of drugs sold by local Chinese manufacturers are generic. \nDespite its well-developed domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing sector, the PRC is a major \nimporter of internationally developed pharmaceutical products. Since the imported products are \ncovered under patent protection and are more expensive, the PRC spends a substantial part of \nits budget for medicine on imported drugs, driving up health care costs. The PRC lacks the \ndevelopment of innovative and high-quality blockbuster drugs and vaccines that can cater to the \nneeds of the domestic market and be exported in the region and globally.7  \n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s pharmaceutical industry has been rapidly expanding since the 1990s. Its share \nof pharmaceutical industry output increased from 2.5% in 1995 to 18.3% in 2010 partly because \nof conducive national policies, economic growth, globalization, and domestic needs (including the \n \n1  The health care industry includes the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, as well as the traditional Chinese \nmedicine industry, health care equipment, and service industries. \n2  The Beijing Municipality (Beijing), Tianjin Municipality (Tianjin), and the Hebei Province (Hebei) make up the \neconomically important BTH region in the northern part of the PRC.  \n3  ADB. 2019.

However,  despite  these  substantial  investments,  the \ninnovation capacity of the PRC health care industry remains weak, with only a few successful \npharmaceutical products recognized globally. For example, the PRC has only 18 drugs included \nin the World Health Organization\u2019s list of prequalified drugs, compared with 355 from India\u2013\u2013a \ncomparable pharmaceutical manufacturing country in terms of size of industry. There are several \nreasons why the health care industry remains weak: (i) government policies and regulations favor \nthe manufacturing of generic drugs for the local market over innovative drugs with export potential, \n(ii) new drug registration and procedures are cumbersome and lengthy, and (iii) concerns linger \nover the safety of pharmaceutical products despite initiatives to strengthen drug regulation \nenforcement.  Inefficiencies  in  drug  and  health  care  equipment  distribution,  poor  industrial \nplanning, and disjointed regulations also drive up health care costs. \n \n5.  There  will  be  a  substantially  growing  need  for  better  access  to  high-quality \npharmaceuticals and health care products in the PRC because of increasing demands. The key \ndrivers of the increasing demand include the PRC\u2019s rapidly aging population, the rising levels of \nnoncommunicable lifestyle diseases (such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension), \nand the increasing purchasing power of the population desiring better health care and health \noutcomes. The PRC health care industry will benefit from a holistic and comprehensive policy \nframework that promotes innovation and the discovery of new drugs under favorable regulatory, \nmarket, financing, and technology transfer environments. Greater availability and access to high-\nquality and cost-effective pharmaceutical and health care products can help achieve the goals of \nthe country\u2019s healthy action plan (footnote 4), which makes health the foundation of economic \nand social development, and prioritize health care industry innovation and scientific development. \nStrengthening the  health  care  industry  will  provide  multiple  benefits  in  the  PRC,  including \ncontributing to the achievement of universal health coverage.9 \n \n6.  The BTH region is one of the PRC\u2019s most important industrialized regions and is a key \npharmaceutical manufacturing hub housing domestic and international pharmaceutical firms. The \ngovernment\u2019s BTH integration plan benefits the region (known locally as Jing-Jin-Ji) by promoting \nimproved models of development and integration in a densely populated and industrialized \nregion.10 Although the health care industry makes up a significant portion of the BTH region, \nseveral challenges remain including (i) low levels of innovation, (ii) lack of coordination between \npolicy-making initiatives and implementation, (iii) disjointed industrial agglomeration imbalances \nbecause of rapid development and industrialization of the region, and (iv) inadequate industrial \nsupport  factors  and  insufficient  service  platforms  for  health  care  industry  development. \nCoordination between Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei can help improve pharmaceutical manufacturing, \npromote the development of innovative drugs, reduce inefficiencies and outdated practices, and \nshare lessons learned.  \n \n7.  The TA focuses on developing evidence-based strategies and policies to strengthen the \nhealth  care  industry  in  the  BTH  region.  It  will  address  the  lack  of  coordination,  industrial \nagglomeration, underdeveloped supply chains, and innovation in the health care industry by  \n(i) assessing the industry policies, guidelines, and regulations; (ii) strengthening the health care \n \n8  J.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: health care industry in the BTH region \nstrengthened (footnote 4). The TA will have the following outcome: policy coordination and \ndevelopment of the health care industry improved.11  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  health  care  industry  policies,  regulations  and \nguidelines, and markets assessed. To address the lack of comprehensive information and \nresearch on policy coordination; and gaps, needs, and opportunities in the health care industry in \nthe BTH region, through the TA a comprehensive assessment will be carried out covering the \nfollowing areas: (i) the industry including the current situation, key drivers of growth, market needs, \ninstitutional arrangements, and basic data on health industry development in relevant provinces \nand cities; (ii) government policies and regulations of the health care industry, including macro \npolicies; implementation practices; industrial policies; and supporting national, provincial, and city \npolicies of the health care industry; and (iii) coordinated development in the BTH region covering \nkey industrial factors, policy factors, human resource talent and skills mix, financing, market \nentities, and scientific research institutions. \n \n10.  Output 2: Health industry coordination and innovation capacity strengthened. This \noutput will focus on (i) developing a draft health care industry policy framework for coordination \nand innovation based on the assessments in output 1, (ii) generating evidence-based strategies \nand plans for the development of the health care industry in the BTH region, (iii) generating \nopportunities for consultations between health care industry stakeholders for better coordination \nand innovations nationally and globally, and (iv) identifying areas for potential future investment \nand/or development by public or private entities. Consultations on the policy framework will be \nconducted through a series of seminars and workshops held with all the relevant stakeholders:  \n(i)  public  sector  (national,  regional,  provincial  officials,  and  pharmaceutical  regulators);                     \n(ii) pharmaceutical and health care companies; (iii) academic research, professional associations, \nand development institutions; and (iv) purchasers. To further generate practical solutions and \ndevelop  ideas  for  improved  coordination  among  crucial  stakeholders,  ideation  workshops  \n(sessions dedicated to generating new ideas) will be organized with industry and stakeholders, \nincluding information sharing with other provinces and representatives of economic zones that \nhave successfully coordinated their industries, to absorb lessons learned and adapt potential \nstrategies.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Knowledge and lessons learned disseminated. This output will include the \n(i) preparation of a publication in Chinese and English on the draft policy framework, guidelines, \nlessons learned, and best practices for regional health care industry development in the context \nof the BTH region based on data from outputs 1 and 2; and (ii) dissemination of findings and \nlessons learned from the TA at the national, regional, and municipal levels during forums and \nmeetings to facilitate adoption and implementation for provincial and national policy makers and \nregulators involved in the development of the health care industry. \n \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nC.
