INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) supports the Department of Finance (DOF) of \nthe Philippines to develop sound tax and fiscal policy through policy-oriented analysis and \ncommunication of fiscal and economic policy priorities with stakeholders. In July 2016, the \nGovernment of the Philippines requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a TA to \nsupport the tax reform priority under the Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda, as well as related \nfiscal reforms and policies. Consultation missions were fielded August\u2013October 2016 to assess \nthe  need  and  feasibility  of  capacity  development  support  for  the  DOF.1 The  government \nconcurred  with  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost financing \narrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Development  challenges.  Public  spending  levels  on  public  services  such  as \ninfrastructure, education, and health are critically dependent on sufficient tax revenues, fiscal \nspace, and adequate budget execution. Low government spending on basic infrastructure and \nsocial services, either because of low tax or slow budget execution, causes poor economic and \nsocial  outcomes  and  a  higher  burden  for  the  population\u2014especially  those  in  low-income \ngroups\u2014who must spend for what the government should have provided. According to the \nGlobal Competitiveness Report 2015\u20132016, tax regulations complexity in the Philippines was \nranked fourth among the most problematic factors for doing business, and tax rates were \nranked fifth, following inefficient bureaucracy (first), inadequate infrastructure (second), and \ncorruption (third).3 This implies limited tax capacity, coupled with the lack of indexation and tax \nrationalization, is a factor in constraining the country\u2019s competitiveness and further growth.4 \nMore effective tax and fiscal policy reforms such as an expanded tax base are needed to \nsupport government expenditure conducive to poverty reduction programs and inclusive growth \nwhile maintaining public spending and debt at sustainable levels. \n \n3.  Need for strengthening tax and fiscal policy. Some progress has been made to \nimprove the fiscal position in the Philippines. Budget deficits as a share of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) were kept at a modest level of 0.9% during 2013\u20132015, much lower than an \naverage of 2.9% in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009\u20132012. Tax revenues as a \npercentage of GDP stood at 13.6% in 2014-2015, up from 12.2% in 2009.5 This was attributable \nto the sin tax reform and better tax administration. However, the ratio of tax revenues to GDP \nremained lower than that of comparable countries in Southeast Asia\u201416.0% for Thailand and \n15.6% for Malaysia in 2014. Given the rising need for public infrastructure and social services, \nthe government  was  increasingly  under  pressure  to generate  higher  revenues  to maintain \nspending needed for facilitating and sustaining medium-term growth and to significantly reduce \npoverty. This delicate balance can be achieved by further strengthening tax reforms and fiscal \npolicy. \n \n                                                \n1  Missions were fielded on 12 August and 2 September 2016 at DOF and 6 October at ADB\u2019s Philippines Country \nOffice (PHCO).  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 October 2016. \n3  World Economic Forum. 2016. Global Competitiveness Report 2015\u20132016. Geneva. \n4  The  country,  with  GDP  per  capita  at  $2,899  in  2015,  was  ranked  47th  out  of  140  countries  in  global \ncompetitiveness, behind Singapore (2nd), Malaysia (18th), Thailand (32nd), and Indonesia (37th). \n5  In dollar terms, this is equivalent to a nearly twofold increase from $20.6 billion in 2009 to $39.9 billion in 2015. \n ", "2 \n4.  Government  priorities.  To  meet  the  ever-increasing  demand  for  investment  in \ninfrastructure  and  social  services,  the  Ten-Point  Socioeconomic  Agenda  rolled  out  by  the \ncurrent government identified tax reform to institute a more progressive, equitable, efficient, and \nsimple tax system among its policy priorities. It also underscored the need to make the tax \nsystem  competitive  relative  to  neighboring  countries.  Tax  measures  being  proposed  to \nCongress include (i) lower individual and corporate income taxes, (ii) expansion of value-added \ntax base, (iii) indexation of oil excise tax to inflation, and (iv) rationalization of fiscal incentives to \ninvestors.6 Other tax reform measures being considered pertain to property taxes and taxes on \nluxury goods (e.g., automobiles, yachts, and jewelry) and sugary products. On the fiscal policy, \nthe government is expected to increase infrastructure investment to 7.0% of GDP by 2022, \nraising the budget deficit to 3.0% of GDP from the 2015 level of 0.9% while mobilizing additional \nrevenues  to  finance  increased  spending.  To  develop  the  tax  package  and  further  fiscal \nconsolidation measures, rigorous economic and welfare analysis is needed. This will provide an \nevidence-based case for the tax reform package and planned fiscal policy. There is also a need \nfor  stakeholders  to  understand  the  impacts  of  implementing  the  government-proposed  tax \nmeasures. The analysis will help ensure tax reform and fiscal policy are effective, objective, and \npro-poor, ultimately ushering in investment, job generation, poverty reduction, and inclusive \ngrowth. \n \n5.  Developing timely, high-quality, and evidence-based policy. Recognizing the need \nfor careful, yet determined, policy-making and implementation, the DOF has proposed the \ncreation of the strategy, economics, and result group (SERG)\u2014a full-time delivery group within \nthe DOF reporting directly to the secretary of finance and concurrently chair of the Cabinet \nEconomic Development Cluster (CEDC), which, in turn, reports to the cabinet members and \nPresidential Management Staff.7 The SERG is mandated to provide strategic advice on tax, \nfiscal policy, and other priority reforms; conduct policy analysis to support the case for these \nreforms; and manage or coordinate these reforms to improve the standard of living in the \ncountry, especially for the poor and marginalized. As a tax and fiscal policy unit dedicated to the \nCEDC, the SERG will enable the government to take decisive actions that are timely, of high \nquality, and evidence based, and to effectively and objectively communicate the reform and \npolicy with stakeholders. Therefore, the establishment of SERG is the DOF\u2019s critical step to \nfacilitate the government\u2019s planned tax reform and fiscal policy as well as other socioeconomic \nagenda. To ensure intergovernment complementarities and coordination, SERG will consult and \ncoordinate with other agencies, including the National Economic and Development Authority. \n \n6.  Lessons from past assistance. In principle, tax systems can be strengthened through \ntax policy, tax administration, and global and regional cooperation among tax authorities. As the \nTA  focuses  on  tax  policy,  it  furthers  ADB\u2019s  past  assistance  for  tax  administration  in  the \nPhilippines and provides continued support for the government\u2019s tax agenda. During 2013\u2013\n2014, ADB provided TA to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to enhance tax administration \ncapacity  of  its  staff.8 During  2007\u20132009,  ADB  facilitated  the  development  policy  support \nprogram cluster to enhance tax administration in the BIR and Bureau of Customs and public \nexpenditure management.9 ADB provided training and workshops to ensure international best\n                                                \n6  These tax reform measures are under the first phase of the government\u2019s tax reform package, as presented by \nDepartment of Budget and Management Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno on 28 September 2016. \n7  An undersecretary was appointed to head the SERG. \n8  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n ", "3 \n \npractices are applied for tax collection. ADB\u2019s assistance successfully enhanced tax revenues. \nHowever, the benefits from improved tax administration capacity would not be sustainable \nwithout effective tax policy and reform in place. To complement the past support, the TA will \nassist at a higher level of tax and fiscal policy making in the DOF, through establishing SERG. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The  TA  will  support  the  development  of  SERG\u2019s  policy  and  advisory  role  and,  in \nparticular, enhance SERG\u2019s capacity under the DOF.10 To develop sound tax and fiscal policy \nthrough policy-oriented analysis and communicating fiscal and economic policy priorities with \nstakeholders, SERG requires ADB\u2019s support in (i) providing technical advice on the design of \npriority reforms, (ii) enhancing quantitative and qualitative analytical research skills for policy \nreform, and (iii) communicating policy reform agenda and research outputs to stakeholders. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be tax revenues increased to 15.6% of GDP. The outcome will be \nstrengthened SERG capacity for tax and fiscal policy to recommend policies and reforms. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA outputs will be: (i) technical advice on the design of priority reforms provided, (ii) \nquantitative and qualitative analytical research skills for policy reform enhanced, and (iii) policy \nreform agenda and research outputs communicated with stakeholders. \n \n10.  Output 1: Technical advice on the design of priority reforms provided. The TA will \nprocure both local and international tax, fiscal, and economic policy experts\u2019 services to help the \nDOF and SERG design the tax, fiscal, and related economic policy reforms. The initial coverage \nareas are the value-added tax expansion and introduction of a sugar-sweetened beverage tax, \ntargeted transfers, and related tax administration reforms.11 In consultation with the DOF and \nSERG, the experts will conduct in-depth assessments on relevant policies and prepare policy \nbriefs and/or analytical papers as resources for policy makers and the CEDC in formulating \nlegislation and implementing rules and regulations. This output will enable the DOF and SERG \nto develop effective tax reform packages and other fiscal policies, and to achieve the needed \npolicy and reform actions under the Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda. \n \n11.  Output 2: Quantitative and qualitative analytical research skills for policy reform \nenhanced. To ensure timely high-quality policy analysis, the TA will enhance the DOF technical \nstaff\u2019s quantitative and qualitative skills. Activities will include direct training of staff on research \nand  analytical  methods  by  experts  and  researchers  experienced  in  policy  formulation  and \nadvice,  and field  studies  in  countries  that  have  planned  and  implemented  progressive  tax \npolicies.  ADB  will  engage  local  and  international  academic  or  public  policy  institutions  to \ncustomize and conduct training courses on econometrics, welfare analysis, poverty, social and \ngender analyses, and tax and fiscal policies for DOF technical staff and staff from relevant line \n                                                \n10 The executive order for establishing SERG as a division in the DOF is expected to be signed by December 2016. \nDOF has allocated $1.25 million for SERG operation and staffing. SERG will need to be funded by a regular budget \nfrom the Department of Budget and Management to ensure financial and organizational sustainability, which will \ntake time. Therefore, the TA will enable SERG to start quickly and, ultimately, stand on its own through timely, \neffective capacity development, and software and hardware procurement. \n11 These areas pertain to the DOF\u2019s first tax reform package submitted to Congress in 2016. The reform package is \nexpected to be in effect in 2018. \n ", "4 \nagencies.  DOF  and  SERG  will  procure  advanced  hardware  (e.g.,  information  technology \nequipment and computer servers) and software (e.g., STATA and Matlab) and use them for \nstatistical and data analysis.12 Software providers will conduct software training courses so staff \ncan maintain and update the software. This output will result in the DOF having the in-house \ncapacity to design effective and objective tax reform and fiscal policy packages. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Policy  reform  agenda  and  research  outputs  communicated  with \nstakeholders. Any policy reform agenda has to be communicated clearly and effectively, while \nbuilding reform coalitions to generate buy-in. The TA will build the DOF technical staff capacity \nto  communicate  policy  into  meaningful  actions.  Activities  include  directly  training  staff  on \neffective  dissemination  of  research  outputs;  disseminating  research  outputs  in  seminars, \nconferences, or forums; and reproducing research output for the public's reference. ADB will \nengage a national firm with strong experience communicating public policy and reform agenda \nto support the DOF in designing and implementing public communications plans and activities to \nlaunch  and  implement  adopted  tax  and  other  reform  measures.  Various  communication \nchannels will be used to target groups such as women, youth, and disadvantaged people. \nThese  will  include  mass  media,  social  media,  audiovisual  presentation,  and  focus  group \ndiscussions with stakeholders. This output will help ensure tax reform and fiscal policy packages \nunder outputs 1 and 2 garner buy-in from stakeholders, including cabinet members, Congress \nrepresentatives, civil society, and the public. \n \n13.  Risks include (i) turnover of DOF technical and research staff, (ii) limited capacity to \nmaintain statistical equipment and update software, and (iii) political resistance to the proposed \ntax and fiscal policy measures. The first two risks can be mitigated by output 2, as capacity-\nbuilding activities will be targeted at permanent technical staff in DOF and SERG and other \nrelevant agencies, and software providers will offer staff training for maintaining and updating \nsoftware. In addition, output 3 can help mitigate the last risk, as effective communications plans \nand activities will nurture support for and ownership in reform agenda and priorities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.2 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and budget,13 office accommodation, \noffice supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The DOF, through SERG and led by the undersecretary, will be the executing and \nimplementing  agency.  It  will  provide  office  space  with  furniture  and  support  services  for \nconsultants,  and  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  management  and  decisions  on  project \nimplementation under the Advance Payment Facility. ADB will administer the TA through the \nPhilippines Country Office (PHCO) of the Southeast Asia Department. The TA commencement \ndate is 1 January 2017; the physical completion date is 31 December 2019. \n \n                                                \n12 After TA completion, advanced statistical hardware and software will be turned over to the government and \nprocured as goods. \n13 The DOF approved the budget of $1.25 million for SERG\u2019s staffing and overall operation. \n ", "5 \n \n16.  PHCO will maintain regular contact with DOF and consultants to ensure work proceeds \naccording to the agreed schedules and expected outputs. TA review missions and consultant \nprogress reports will provide adequate monitoring and evaluation of TA delivery. In addition to \nformal TA deliverables, consultants will be required to prepare brief quarterly reports every 3 \nmonths during the contract period. PHCO will participate in all workshops, seminars, and public \noutreach activities to ensure stakeholder views and concerns are adequately addressed in \nconsultant deliverables. The project outputs will be promoted through mass media, social media, \nacademic journals, and other public dissemination and mass communication. External peer \nreview of consultant deliverables may be sought for soundness and objectivity. \n \n17.  The TA requires 126 person-months of international and national expert inputs. Experts \ninclude (i) a team leader (20 person-months, individual, international, intermittent), (ii) policy \nexperts  (20  person-months,  individual,  international  or  national,  intermittent),  (iii)  an \neconometrics  institution  (20  person-months,  firm,  international,  intermittent),  (iv)  a \ncommunications firm (20 person-months, firm, national, intermittent), and (v) research assistants \n(46 person-months, individual, national, full-time). Individual experts or firms can provide training \nprograms, as needed. Output-based or lump-sum contracts will be considered in engaging \nconsulting services to reduce administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value \nfor money. Firm consultants will be recruited based on the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with the 80:20 quality\u2013cost ratio. \n \n18.  Consultants will be recruited by ADB and managed following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), on a competitive basis following \nadvertising on the ADB website, evaluating expressions of interest received, and short-listing \nqualified experts. All procurement will be done following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time). The TA disbursement will be done following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for Strengthening Tax and Fiscal Policy Capacity for Inclusive \nGrowth, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nTax revenues increased to 15.6% of gross domestic producta \n  Data Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with Targets  Reporting \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020:     \nSERG capacity for tax  a.
