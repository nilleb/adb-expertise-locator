INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  INNOLAND,  an \nincubation, acceleration, and research center of the Innovations Center LLC at the State Agency \nfor Public Services and Social Innovations (SAPSSI) under the President of Azerbaijan, to set up \neffective and efficient local institutional arrangements to support tech startups.1 \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the strategic pillars of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership strategy (CPS) for Azerbaijan, 2019\u20132023 on boosting private sector development \nand strengthening human capital.2 It is also in line with the crosscutting priority of ADB\u2019s CPS to \nstrengthen governance through information and communication technology (ICT). The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Azerbaijan, 2020\u20132022.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Government of Azerbaijan recognizes the importance of digital development for \nmaking the national economy knowledge-based, and considers the development of the ICT sector \nto be an important element of the diversification of the economy away from hydrocarbons.4 The \ngovernment views tech startups as a driving force for the country\u2019s ICT sector and digital \ntransformation, and as a source of innovative solutions and productivity growth for the economy.5 \nADB\u2019s CPS envisages support for expanding ICT infrastructure and services in the regions. This \nincludes  fostering  digital  microbusinesses  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and \nstrengthening the enabling environment for the digital economy. \n \n4.  Tech startup growth is constrained by regulatory gaps, lack of knowledge on how to \naccess finance, a lack of digital literacy, and limited awareness of the opportunities available for \ntech startups. Promoting the emergence of tech startups in the regions outside the Absheron \nPeninsula, which is the location of the capital, Baku, and the center of the country\u2019s economic \nactivity, is particularly challenging. Baku generated 71.8% of national output and received 74.5% \nof total capital investment in 2016.6 The regions\u2019 economic and digital lag, compounded by a \nshortage of ICT infrastructure,7especially affects the youth, women, and people with disabilities \nwho suffer most from unemployment and lack of economic opportunities.8 The Azerbaijan Digital \n \n1  More  details  on  INNOLAND  can  be  accessed  at  http://innoland.az/en  and  the  Innovation  Center  at \nhttps://www.icenter.az/en. \n2  ADB. 2019. Country Partnership Strategy: Azerbaijan, 2019\u20132023\u2014Promoting Diversified and Inclusive Growth. \nManila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 April 2020. ADB. 2019. Country \nOperations Business Plan: Azerbaijan, 2020\u20132022. Manila. The TA has been included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan under the title Digital Technologies for Economic Diversification programmed for 2020. \n4  Strategic Roadmap for Development of Telecommunications and Information Technologies in Azerbaijan (adopted \nby the Presidential Decree no. 1138 dated 6 December 2016); and the State Program on Socio-Economic \nDevelopment of the Regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2019\u20132023 (adopted the Presidential Decree no. 500 \ndated 29 January 2019). \n5  Tech startups are entrepreneurial ventures that deliver new, innovative, and scalable technology-based products and \nservices to the market. Where such products and services already exist, tech startups introduce new ways to deliver \nthem. The hallmark of startups is their creativity, which establishes new business models for the economy, and thus \ndistinguishes tech startups from other small and medium-sized enterprises. \n6 ADB. 2019.

Baku. \n8 In Azerbaijan, only 16% of women use internet services on their phones, and only 27% of women entrepreneurs use \ncomputers for entrepreneurial activities. This pattern is more marked for women in rural areas. ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nHub program is a public\u2013private effort aimed at improving the country\u2019s ICT connectivity by \nbuilding fiber-optic cables in the country and constructing the Trans-Caspian fiber-optic cable with \nthe ultimate objective of transforming the country into a regional digital hub.9 The quarantine \nregime,  distant  work  arrangements,  and  need  for  quick  and  efficient  outreach  to  various \npopulation groups during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have crystalized the \nimportance and urgency of improving the ICT infrastructure and governance and spurring the \ndigitalization of the economy.10 \n \n5.  The government has been taking measures to strengthen the enabling environment for \nthe emergence and growth of a robust startups industry beyond the Absheron Peninsula. It also \nfosters the development of startups through several agencies. In 2019 there were more than 20 \npublic and private startup incubation and acceleration centers in Azerbaijan. Tech startups that \nfall into the small and medium-sized enterprises category and have received startup certificates \nare exempt from profit tax on innovative activities for 3 years. \n \n6.  The Innovation Center under SAPSSI is one of the leading agencies for facilitating the \ndevelopment of tech startups in Azerbaijan and promoting links with tech startups abroad. In the \nSilicon Valley, the United States (US), INNOLAND established the Azerbaijan \u201cTech Diaspora,\u201d a \nforum that brings together Azerbaijanis who work for leading digital companies such as Facebook, \nGoogle, and Twitter. As part of this process, Azerbaijan\u2019s Innovations House, which will support \nstartups in the country, was inaugurated at Stanford University in the US in February 2020. To \npromote  the  development  of  tech  startups  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  regions  from  2020,  INNOLAND \nannounced the opening of incubation centers in Ganja and Sheki, the target regions of the TA. \n \n7.  In Ganja, INNOLAND intends to deliver incubation and acceleration assistance (IAA) \nthrough the Department of Innovations of Ganja State University (GSU); and Azerbaijan State \nAgrarian University (ASAU), which will focus on tech startups related to agriculture. In Sheki, the \nIAA is planned to be delivered through INNOLAND\u2019s branch office \u2500 INNOLAND Sheki. ASAU, \nGSU,  and  INNOLAND  Sheki  require  comprehensive  capacity  building  to  enable  them  to \nsustainably deliver IAA and eventually become regional tech startup facilitation hubs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: startups to support innovative solutions in \nrural and nonrural production areas created, developed, and promoted.11 The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: local capacity for effective facilitation of tech startups strengthened. The \nintended outcome will be achieved through implementation of the outputs described in paras. 9\u2013\n11.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Enabling environment for local tech startups strengthened. This output will \ninclude (i) undertaking a diagnostic study of the generic and sector-specific enabling environment \n \n9  Details on the Azerbaijan Digital Hub initiative can be accessed here https://www.azertelecom.az/en/projects/key/. \n10 About 65% of internet market falls under government-owned operators. Telecommunication infrastructure is also \nmostly in public hands. This may limit the competition and hence reduce the potential price and quality efficiencies. \n11 Presidential Decree on State Program on Socio-Economic Development of the Regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan \nin 2019\u20132023 (no. 500 dated 29 January 2019). \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nfor tech startups in the two target regions;13 (ii) developing a strategy for establishing efficient and \nsustainable institutional arrangements for startup facilitation;14 and (iii) preparing an action plan \nto support the growth of tech startups at the target institutions (ASAU, GSU, and INNOLAND \nSheki). \n \n10.  Output 2: Local institutional setup for tech startup development improved. This \noutput will help INNOLAND and the target institutions plan and execute the IAA based on the \ndiagnostic study, medium- and long-term strategies, and the action plan developed under output \n1. Output 2 will involve the design and roll-out of capacity-building programs that will be designed \nbased on consultations with local stakeholders, including women, in the target regions. These \nprograms will help local tech startups develop fundamental skills, such as business accounting, \ntaxation,  and marketing;  and  advanced  skills, such  as  creativity,  persuasion,  collaboration, \nadaptability, and elevator pitch presentation. The output will also support the preparation and \ndelivery of such knowledge activities as workshops and startup competitions (e.g., idea fests and \nhackathons) to be held in cooperation with public and private sector startup event organizers. \nINNOLAND  will  engage  Azerbaijan  Tech  Diaspora  and  Azerbaijan\u2019s  Innovations  House  to \norganize the knowledge activities, which will also be coordinated with the Azerbaijan Digital Hub \nprogram and the ADB Ventures platform.15 \n \n11.  Output 3: Knowledge partnerships developed. This output will support the creation of \ntwinning partnerships between Azerbaijan\u2019s tech startup facilitators (INNOLAND and the target \ninstitutions) and their counterpart centers of excellence in Asia and the Pacific.16 This may entail \nsupporting internships for selected staff of INNOLAND, INNOLAND Sheki, ASAU, and GSU with \nthe twinning partners; short-term visits of the twinning partner staff for specific knowledge transfer \nor on-the-job training; and topic-specific study tours, including for tech startups.17 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF) and administered by \nADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, \nvenues for activities, communication facilities for consultants, remuneration for TA focal persons \nassigned, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n \n13 Generic factors pertain to the regulatory framework, institutional setup, existing startup incubation programs, human \nresources, ICT infrastructure, financing, and real sector dynamics. The review will consider the ecosystem factors \npertinent to startups in fintech, e-commerce, cleantech, agritech, education technology, and healthtech; and analyze \nthe optimal design options for tech startup incubators. The review will also discuss relevant international experience \nin creating a conducive environment for startups, including practices from Germany, the Republic of Korea, \nSingapore, and the US. \n14 This output will build on ADB\u2019s research on constraints to the growth of startups in Azerbaijan (completed in \nDecember 2019); and will focus on the development of startups in clean energy, agriculture, health, and education, \nwith special attention paid to startups with strong gender and climate impacts. \n15 ADB Ventures is a platform established in January 2020 to support and invest in startups offering impact technology \nsolutions that contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific. \n16 The twinning partners will be defined during the implementation of output 1 in consultation with and facilitated by the \nDigital Technology for Development Unit of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. The \npossibility of building a twinning partnership with Silicon Valley will also be considered. \n17 This output may also support staff of other government agencies involved in tech startup facilitation, subject to \nSAPSSI\u2019s request, the availability of TA budget, and the agreement of ADB. \n ", "4 \nD.
