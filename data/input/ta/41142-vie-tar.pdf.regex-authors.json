In March 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) accepted the administration of the \nJapan  Fund  for  Public  Policy  Training  (JFPPT),  which  aims  to  assist  developing  member \ncountries\u2019 (DMCs) institutions to build their capacities for public policy training and education, \ninitially  concentrating  on  transition  economies  such  as  Viet  Nam.  Initially,  the  JFPPT  was \nadministered  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  Institute.  However,  in  October  2005,  this \nresponsibility was transferred to ADB with the current Southeast Asia Department (SERD) as the \nadministrative focal point. On 2 December 2005, regional technical assistance (RETA) for the \nPublic Policy Training Program (PPTP) 2006 in the amount of $950,000 was approved to support \nimplementation of the activities in 2006.1 Lessons learned in implementing the first year of the \nProgram under the first RETA, and consultations with the governments concerned\u2014including \nCambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  Viet  Nam\u2014resulted  in  the \ndevelopment of the proposed second RETA to support a multiyear PPTP for 2007\u20132010 for \nfurther implementation of the activities under the JFPPT. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam all \nsupport the expansion of the PPTP activities. The enhancement of public policy training in these \ncountries is expected to provide a solid contribution to strengthening the overall capacity of senior \nofficials in efficiently managing their public administration systems. The proposed second RETA \nalso responds to the request that the PPTP should help not only civil service officials but also \nsenior government leaders in areas such as leadership management, dealing with mass media, \naddressing civil society, effective negotiations, and public governance. The design and monitoring \nframework is shown in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.  The three Mekong countries, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam are all going through \nsignificant changes at various speeds from planned to market-oriented economy, from isolation to \nregional and global integration, and from rural agro-based to more balanced economies with an \nincreasing share of industry and service sectors. For these transformations to succeed, the civil \nservice staff in these countries need to be trained in areas and scale unprecedented before. The \nacceleration of regional integration among the GMS countries have added a further sense of \nurgency on the need to develop a well trained pool of civil service officials in all these three \ncountries. \n \n3.  With their regional and global integration, all three transitional economies will be required  \nto take increasingly more complex decisions so as to remain competitive and in compliance with \nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations. These decisions permeate all sectors ranging \nfrom  banking,  finance,  manufacturing,  foreign  trade,  fiscal  management  and  budgeting, \ninternational law, information technology, foreign language, among others. These countries are \nalso exposed considerably more to the increased competition and shifting comparative advantage. \nFurthermore, with the opening of their economies, the policy instruments available to them for \nprudent macro economic management become fewer, making such management more difficult \nthan when their economies were closed.  \n  \n4.  On an individual basis, Viet Nam\u2019s sustained high growth, consistent annual increase in \nforeign direct investment (FDI), and its target of exiting from a low-income to a middle-income-\ncountry by 2010 have all placed a severe strain on the country\u2019s existing civil service system. Viet \nNam is currently at a stage of development where the country\u2019s existing capacity lags far behind \n                                                \n1  ADB, 2005. Technical Assistance for Public Policy Training Program 2006 (TA 6277-REG). Manila. Subsequently, \nTA 6277-REG was extended to August 2007 to allow time for the processing of the follow-on RETA. \n2  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 July 2007. \n ", "2   \nthe  demand for efficient  civil  service  delivery,  timely  decision  making and  able  civil  service \nmanagement from the business sector (domestic as well as foreign). The civil service system in \nthe country remains ill-equipped and inadequate in terms of both quality and technical ability. \nThere  is  an  acute  shortage  of  required  technical,  administrative  and  management  skills  in \ndifferent areas and agencies both at national and provincial levels.  \n \n5.  The problem of a weak civil service system is also prevalent in the case of Cambodia, \nhaving lost a generation of educated citizens in the aftermath of the civil war in the 1980s. With \n50% of the civil servants below the age of 40, Lao PDR also needs substantial strengthening of \nthe administrative and technical staff in its civil service system. Both countries critically require \nmodernization and professionalization of their respective civil service systems. \n \n6.  The civil service officials in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam therefore need to be \ntrained in a range of areas covering multiple disciplines. There are ongoing efforts to upgrade the \ncountries\u2019 existing pre-service civil service training institutions. However, in the case of in-service \ntraining for advanced and contemporary subjects, weaknesses exist particularly in the articulation \nof training needs, formulation of programs and effectiveness in delivery which highlight the urgent \nneed for creating a mechanism for strengthening the civil service officials\u2019 capacities in their \nfunctions. The lack of a modernized system in public policy training of middle to senior level civil \nservice officials and limited opportunity for higher training on leadership and management need to \nbe addressed as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, these countries made a strong request for \nADB support.  The proposed RETA is intended to address these needs by helping establish \neffective  knowledge  networking  partnerships  between  these  transitional  economies  with  the \noutstanding public policy research and training institutions both within and outside of the region \nwith the recognition that in each country there are also efforts to improve domestic institutions for \ncivil service training particularly for pre-service training. There are also considerable interest \namong external public policy training and research institutions to extend assistance. The RETA, \nby facilitating the development of knowledge-exchange hubs and helping create core groups of \ntrainees and trainers, will enable capacity build-up in the RETA countries on a long-term basis, in \nline with the goals and objectives of the JFPPT.  \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The RETA is designed to undertake full implementation of the PPTP during 2007\u20132010, \nfollowing on from the start-up activities initiated under the TA 6277-REG. The full implementation \nwill involve a number of activities\u2014short-term and long-term, in country and abroad\u2014all aimed at \nhelping build sustained domestic institutional capacity in these countries. This will be undertaken \nthrough well-designed formal and informal in-service training programs for civil service officials at \nmiddle to senior levels. The programs will be initiated in Viet Nam and extended to Cambodia and \nthe  Lao  PDR  as  appropriate.  The  RETA  will  also  provide  specialized  programs  for  senior \ngovernment leaders on various technical and non-technical subjects.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The RETA will adopt a process approach whereby all the components of PPTP are \ndesigned and implemented in close consultation with key government agencies of the three \ncountries. The courses to be selected and the contents to be covered will be developed based on \nthe training needs assessment of respective ministries and agencies. They will be reviewed and \n ", "  3 \nendorsed, by the Advisory Committee in the case of Viet Nam (established under PPTP 2006) \nand by the counterpart agencies in the case of Cambodia and Lao PDR.  \n \n9.  The key activities of the RETA include: (i) implementation of core competency courses in \npublic policy for mid-career and senior level civil servants of Viet Nam; (ii) introduction of similar \ncourses in Cambodia and Lao PDR; (iii) a fellowship program to send outstanding candidates for \nformal degree courses overseas; and (iv) a teaching support component to develop case studies \nand best practice cases and other learning materials with national and regional content.  \n \n10.  One  of  the  major  RETA  activities  in  Viet  Nam  will  include  an  exclusive  leadership \nmanagement program customized for senior government leaders. The leadership program will \ninclude managing media, dealing with civil society, effective negotiation skills, English language \nskills, international law, public good governance, and an anticorruption program. The leadership \nprogram will last 10\u201315 days and be implemented initially as a pilot program in early 2008. \n \n11.  A multiyear structured series of short- and medium-term courses will constitute the next 4 \nyears of the Program (2007\u20132010). The implementation of core courses will be carried out in \nbatches  of  about  100  participants,  trained  in  classes  of  no  larger  than  35  students  each. \nAdditional  courses  and  programs  that  address  specific  economic,  public  administration  and \nleadership skills will also be offered in line with the expressed requests of the line ministries. By \nearly 2008, about three batches of participants from the three countries will have completed the \ntraining course in public policy designed for their countries. All of these courses will be conducted \nin local languages through translation. \n \n12.  Core courses will run for succeeding years through 2010 for three or more batches \nannually, each batch consisting of about 100 participants in Viet Nam. Seminars will also be \noffered and capacity building programs will be continued in Cambodia and Lao PDR. At the end \nof 4 years, it is expected that the PPTP will have graduated over 12 batches of participants who \nhave  undertaken  various  public  policy  training  programs,  and  substantially  more  with  the \nparticipants in specialized courses. The minimum projected number of alumni after 4 years is \nexpected to be around 1,800\u20132,000\u2014including 1,100\u20131,200 Vietnamese senior civil servants and \n700\u2013800 senior civil servants from Cambodia and Lao PDR.  \n \n13.  A public policy fellows program will be awarded to 25 outstanding PPTP graduates for \nformal higher degree training courses. The candidates will be selected on a highly competitive \nbasis by a selection committee composed of government representatives (represented in the \nsteering committee); PPTP program manager; and Viet Nam Resident Mission (VRM), ADB. A list \nof accredited overseas institutions will serve as partner institutions, and they will be selected on \nthe basis of their global reputation in public policy education. \n \n14.  Under the RETA, the resource center for public policy will be established and reinforced \n(as appropriate) in each of the three countries with the resource materials, case studies,  relevant \ntechnical documents and other necessary equipment to serve the participants in the training \ncourses. Each center will be designed as an integral part of the PPTP with the aim of meeting the \nneeds  of  participants  for  independent  and  group  research  to  support  their  overall  learning \nexperiences. A teaching support component will be developed to generate teaching materials in \npublic policy that are relevant to the contexts of the three countries and which can be tapped by \ntheir respective training institutes for future programs. The training materials and equipment will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007 as amended from time to \ntime) and will be provided to the country resource centers. The materials and equipment will be \ntransferred to each RETA country upon RETA completion. In order to ensure that the long-term \n ", "4   \ninstitutional benefits of the RETA are sustained, assurances have been obtained that (i) the \ntraining materials and the training programs to be prepared under the RETA will be extensively \nused  for  further  training  of  the  new  batches  of  civil  service  officials  even  after  the  RETA \ncompletion; (ii)  the knowledge networking to be established under the RETA with the various \nregional/international institutions will be retained and further developed through frequent contacts \nand/or visits; and (iii) the training facilities, programs and materials and other equipment to be \nhanded over to the countries upon RETA completion will receive maximum care for their proper \nmaintenance and subsequent training uses.  \n \n15.  It is important that the PPTP training programs are properly assessed and evaluated on a \ncontinuing basis to allow appropriate adjustments, using feedback from interim results in the \nteaching and learning approaches. This will ensure that the objectives of the programs are \nachieved  effectively  and  efficiently.  Feedback  will  be  obtained  from  participants  as  well  as \nresource  institutions  on  each  activity  under  PPTP  so  that  any  necessary  adjustments  are \nundertaken in real time, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the entire training program.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $21.4 million over a period of 4 years, of which \n$17.8 million will be financed on a grant basis by the JFPPT funded by the Government of Japan \nand administered by ADB. The balance of $3.6 million will be financed from the governments of \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam in the form of cash and kind. A breakdown of costs is shown \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  VRM will be the Executing Agency of the RETA and will be responsible for the overall \nRETA  administration.  An  international  expert  will  be  engaged  to  act  as  program  manager, \noverseeing  the  training  program  design  and  in  ensuring  that  implementation  is  carried  out \nefficiently, while taking into account governments\u2019 views and comments. The program manager \nwill be assisted by an advisor and a small group of technical and support staff carried over from \nthe earlier RETA, and will report to the Country Director, VRM (Appendix 3). The program \nmanager,  advisor,  and  technical  experts  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The Advisory Committee, set up in Viet Nam under the PPTP 2006 will be retained. \nHowever, in addition to the original members, it will be expanded to include a senior official from \nthe  Central  Organization  Committee.  To  provide  the  necessary  support  to  the  effective \nfunctioning of the Viet Nam Advisory Committee, the existing Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nSecretariat in the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will also act as the Secretariat for the \nAdvisory Committee. The functions of the Advisory Committee and its Secretariat in Viet Nam are \nshown in Appendix 4. The utilization of the existing Secretariat will relieve MPI of additional \nadministrative burden and enhance the complementarities between the ongoing GMS program \nand the proposed RETA. In view of the expected increased workload, the secretariat coordinator \nwill be assisted initially by one additional middle level staff and two more junior staff in carrying \nout administrative and other related activities. As the PPTP activities from the proposed RETA \nexpand  further,  the  Secretariat  may  need  one  additional  middle  level  staff  and  two  more \nsupporting staff during the later years of the PPTP implementation.  \n \n19.  The program manager will (i) hold regular consultations with the secretariat coordinator (in \nthe case of Viet Nam) and other relevant officials of Cambodia and Lao PDR; and (ii) ensure that \n ", "  5 \nthe training programs and other RETA activities fully reflect the governments\u2019 required training \nneeds and aspirations through close consultation. While the Advisory Committee is created in \nViet Nam, on initial consultations in Cambodia and Lao PDR, it was not felt necessary to develop \nparallel structures in those countries as their respective civil service training programs could be \nfully coordinated through existing assistance channels.  \n \n20.  An inter-country steering committee composed of one national coordinator from each of \nthe RETA countries will be established to coordinate the functioning of the PPTP activities. The \nnational coordinator to be nominated by their respective governments could be an official already \nworking as the GMS national coordinator for ensuring and reinforcing the complementarities of \nPPTP with the ongoing Phnom Penh Plan. The program manager and Country Director, VRM, \nwill also be members of this committee. The national coordinators will function as the focal points \nin each country. The steering committee will meet periodically to review the RETA progress, \naddress any regional issues as they arise, and ensure smooth and timely implementation the \nRETA. \n \n21.  For the actual design and delivery of the multi-disciplinary training programs, the RETA \nwill engage selected outstanding public policy research/training institutions within and outside the \nregion. Given that the RETA is meant to help create sustained long-term, in-house institutional \ncapacity for public policy training in the RETA countries, facilitating the networking and twinning \narrangements with reputable regional and international institutions with the domestic demands is \nconsidered a key. Resorting to various short-term international consultants, as under the PPTP \n2006, has been found to be less effective since such an approach is unlikely to leave behind \nsustainable long-term institutional ties in these countries. Support of regional and international \ninstitutions for the leadership programs and public policy training activities and related services \nunder the RETA is to be secured through single source selection of outstanding institutions with \ndemonstrated credibility and a record of excellence in their fields. Such institutions would have \nextensive relevant experience in different countries within the region. Such an approach will help \nRETA countries establish long-term institutional linkages with these international and regional \ninstitutions and help establish the desired capacity buildup in these countries on a long-term basis. \n \n22.  Sample terms of reference of such partner institutions are shown in Appendix 5. The \nassignment of such institutions will be up to 36 months each, staggered over a 4-year period \n(2007\u20132010). A number of national consultants and/or universities/research institutes will also be \nrecruited in the three countries for the design and delivery of the training program and the \npreparation of case studies for a total number of 170 person-months (90 person-months for Viet \nNam  and  40  person-months  each  for  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR).  They  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n23.  In developing and executing the component relating to the leadership program for senior \nleaders,  the  services  of  contracted  institutions  could  also  be  supplemented  by  additional \ninternational institutes/universities or individuals as appropriate. Such flexibility is expected to \nenhance the effectiveness of the leadership program given the exclusive nature of the component. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n24.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $17.8 million to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Public Policy Training for the Public Policy Training Program 2007\u20132010. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Training opportunities will \nPublic administration  Improved government  Governance Assessments  be effectively used to \nsystems of  transitional  decision making  and    upgrade the capacity of the \neconomies including  implementation  Various surveys on business  relevant officials \nCambodia, Lao PDR and  particularly with regard to  environment   \nViet Nam managed  public policies involving  \u2022  Administrative and policy \nefficiently  transition to a market  reforms in the transition of \n  economy  the relevant countries will \nprovide greater \nopportunities for improved \nmanagement \n \nRisks \n\u2022  Training outcomes may not \nbe applied due to the \nexisting public \nadministration and policy \nframework \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Established knowledge \nModernized system in  Higher level training on  Governance assessments  networks continue to be \npublic policy training  leadership and    supported and deepened \nestablished   management   Evaluation reports of the civil   \n    service training systems of  \u2022  There continues to be \nImproved availability of  the relevant countries  strong ownership among \nrelevant programs for    the countries to improve \ndifferent areas of public  Reports to be produced under   public policy formulation \npolicy  PPTP  and implementation through \n  capacity building \nMechanisms to identify   \ndifferent and evolving  Risks \ntraining needs in public  \u2022  Lack of resources to \npolicy  are well developed   continue or deepen public \n  policy training \nEnhanced leadership  \u2022  Lack of willingness to \nmanagement skill of  openly discuss public policy \nparticipants  issues with outside \n  institutions \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Implementation of well \n1.
