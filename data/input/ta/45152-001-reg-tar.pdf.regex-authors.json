INTRODUCTION \n1.  Task force 3 of the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI), a regional initiative established \nunder the Forum of Finance Ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \nJapan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea (collectively ASEAN+3) \nrequested  during  its  meeting  in  February  2006  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nundertake technical assistance (TA) to review of policies, practices, and regulatory standards for \nbond issuance in individual countries of ASEAN+3 and explore the possibility of harmonizing \nthese standards and practices to facilitate the development of an Asian bond market. \n \n2.  To support the ABMI, ADB provided regional policy and advisory TA in 2008 to assess \npolicies  and  standards  of  government  and  corporate  bond  markets  and  the  role  of  self-\nregulatory organizations (SROs) in the countries of ASEAN+3. The TA supported activities \nunder the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF),1 which was established under ABMI task \nforce  3  in  May  2010  to  facilitate  discussion  on  harmonizing  bond  standards.  ASEAN+3 \ngovernments requested ADB during the ABMI task force 3 meeting on 9 March 2011 in Bali, \nIndonesia, to follow up on the TA with continuous support for activities under the ABMF. The \nproposed TA will continue to support the ABMF\u2019s creation of a common program for cross-\nborder bond issuance in the region and the enhancement of straight-through processing (STP).2 \nThe TA, initially categorized as research and development TA in the concept paper, has been \nre-categorized as regional policy and advisory TA (R-PATA) considering that its key activities \nwill be guided by Task force 3 of ABMI and principal outputs will be in the form of policy advice \nand recommendations to ASEAN+3. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In August 2003, the finance ministers of ASEAN+3 established the ABMI to promote the \ndevelopment of domestic and regional bond markets by (i) facilitating access to bond markets \nfor a wide variety of issuers, and (ii) removing policy and regulatory impediments to market \ndevelopment. \n \n4.  Much has been achieved since the ABMI was launched. The volume of outstanding \nbonds denominated in local currency in emerging East Asia has grown sharply from less than \n$1.0 trillion at the end of 2001 to $5.2 trillion by the end of 2010.3 Local currency bond markets \nbecame an effective alternative source of funding for governments and corporations during the \nrecent global financial crisis. The policy focus has therefore shifted from creating bond markets \nto deepening them. Promoting intraregional portfolio investments to recycle regional savings \ninto regional investments became a particularly important goal.4 \n \n                                                \n1  The members of ABMF, appointed or endorsed by ABMI task force 3, include regulatory bodies, stock exchanges, \nSROs, associations of market participants in region, and international market players. Key activities and outputs of \nthe ABMF are reported to and guided by ABMI task force 3. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 June 2011.  \n3  Data  is  from  AsianBondsOnline  (http://asianbondsonline.adb.org/regional/regional.php).  Emerging  East  Asia \ncomprises the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the \nPhilippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet Nam. \n4  The  International  Monetary  Fund  Coordinated  Portfolio  Investment  Survey \n(http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/pi/geo.htm) shows only 4.3% of the debt securities portfolio outflow from the \nregion invested into the region in 2009, while 33.9% went to Europe and 29.2% to the United States (data available \nfor Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; and \nThailand). \n ", "2   \n5.  On 2 May 2010, ASEAN+3 finance ministers meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, endorsed \nthe establishment of the ABMF as a common platform to foster the standardization of market \npractices and harmonization of regulations on cross-border bond transactions in the region. The \nABMF aims to make markets more transparent, standardized, and harmonized to make cross-\nborder transactions more efficient, effective and cheaper; boost issuance and investment in the \nregion; and so contribute to efficiently channeling regional savings into investments in the region. \n \n6.  Unlike in Europe, there is no super-national body in Asia; no mechanism or function \ncomparable to the European Commission exists to coordinate member states or enact rules and \nregulations. Unlike in developed markets, the role of the private sector in setting standards and \ncommon practices in Asia is still limited. The ABMF is expected to bridge the gaps separating (i) \nregulators in ASEAN+3, enabling more harmonized regulations; (ii) private sector players in the \nregion, enabling more standardized market practices; and (iii) the private and public sectors, \nenabling more integrated markets in the region. In other words, the ABMF is a step toward \ninstitutionalizing policy formulation regionally. The forum aims to (i) assess existing regulatory \nframeworks  and  recommend  how  to  foster  the  harmonization  of  regulations  and  market \npractices  to  facilitate  cross-border  bond  transactions  in  the  region;  (ii)  enhance  dialogue \nbetween the private sector and ASEAN+3 officials to develop bond markets in the region and \npromote  harmonization,  standardization,  and  integration;  and  (iii)  provide  opportunities  to \nexchange knowledge, expertise, and experience across the private and public sectors in the \nregion. \n \n7.  The  ABMI  adopted  a  comprehensive  road  map  to  identify  issues  and  priorities  in \ndeveloping bond markets in the region at the 11th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting in \nMadrid in May 2008. The road map identified harmonizing bond standards as a key goal, and \nthe ABMF has assumed a central role in achieving it. The TA is thus consistent with the ABMI \nroad map. The work supported by this TA is under the purview of ABMI task force 3.5  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  Under the current regional policy and advisory TA,6 which will conclude on 31 December \n2011, the ABMF has started work in two areas: Sub-forum 1 works to close the information gaps \nin the market regarding regulatory information to build a foundation for future discussions on \nharmonization  and  standardization.  Sub-forum  2  works  to  enhance  regional  STP  by \nharmonizing  transaction  procedures  and  standardizing  messaging  formats.7 These  efforts \neventually reduce transaction costs to catalyze a more active intraregional bond market. \n \n9.  As a result of the phase 1 study, sub-forum 1 is expected to narrow the information gap \nin the market by producing comprehensive market guides for the region, which will be published \nby the end of 2011 after endorsement by ASEAN+3 governments. Sub-forum 2 will provide fit-\nand-gap analysis to identify differences in communication protocols and standards in each \nmarket, which will reveal technical barriers to harmonization. The report will be published by the \nend of 2011 with the sub-forum 1 market guide. \n                                                \n5  ABMI task force 3 works to improve the regulatory framework by (i) strengthening the regulatory framework for \nsecurities, (ii) facilitating collaboration among SROs in the region, (iii) improving bankruptcy procedures related to \nbond transactions, and (iv) promoting the application of accounting standards broadly consistent with international \nstandards. \n6  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Harmonization of Bond Standards in ASEAN+3. Manila (TA 6514-REG). As of \n15 December 2011, 88% of the TA (or about US$ 840,000) has been disbursed. \n7  STP is generally recognized as a mechanism that enables trading to be conducted electronically without manual \nhandling or intervention. \n ", "3 \n \n  \n10.  The proposed follow-on TA will (i) discuss creating a common program for cross-border \nbond  issuance  in  the  region  using  information  collected  under  sub-forum  1;  and  (ii)  keep \nworking on enhancing STP, as sub-forum 2 will continue because the phase 1 study addresses \nonly government bond transactions. It is necessary to expand the scope of the study to other \nsecurities  such  as  corporate  bonds  and  equities,  as  these  are  issued  using  the  same \ntransaction procedures and electronic trading systems. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be  greater and efficient mobilization of regional financial \nresources. Deeper and more integrated financial market will allocate funds and resources more \nefficiently and thereby make financial systems in the region more sound and resilient. The \noutcome of the TA will be increased cross border bond transactions. By adopting a new scheme \nfor the common issuance of bonds and enhancing STP, the bond market in the region could \nmore  efficiently  support  recycling  of  regional  resources  with  increased  cross  border  bond \ntransactions.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The TA will (i) provide in-depth analysis of bond markets in the region and make \nintraregional comparisons to identify national differences and the market characteristics required \nfor harmonization and standardization, (ii) explore issues to promote the harmonization of bond \nstandards to facilitate cross-border issuance and investment, and (iii) prepare a strategy and \nroad  map  for  harmonizing  regulations  and  market  practices  and  integrating  bond  markets \nacross the region. \n  \n13.   Under sub-forum 1, the TA will discuss and propose a common program for bond \nissuance in the region that regional issuers and investors will find efficient and convenient. A \nforum of SROs in the region will be organized to discuss the common program for issuance as \nthe next step of sub-forum 1.8 The new forum of SROs is expected to discuss self-regulation \nand codes of conduct to create a common issuance scheme. Based on discussion in the forum \nof  SROs,  sub-forum  1  will  prepare  (i)  a  common  program  of  bond  issuance  for  private \nplacement by qualified issuers, qualified investors, and qualified brokers, and (ii) a strategy and \nroad map to promote the new issuance program. In relation to a common issuance program, the \nABMF can join the discussion now current in the region on how to improve credit rating. \n \n14.  Sub-forum 2 will continue to identify transaction flows and procedures for government \nand  corporate  bonds  to  enhance  regional  STP  and  report  on  (i)  transaction  flows  and \nprocedures in corporate bonds with analysis of corporate actions in member states, (ii) a fit-and-\ngap analysis of the existing system and possible and desirable systems, and (iii) a road map to \nstandardize securities messaging and transaction flows in the region. \n \n                                                \n8  In theory, there are two approaches to creating a common program of bond issuance. First, regulators can agree \non a regulatory framework consistent across jurisdictions. This has been done by the ASEAN Capital Market \nForum. Second, a regional SRO functioning similarly to the International Capital Market Association for the \nEurobond can be convened for market participants to set regional self-governing rules for international bonds \nissued in the region. Considering the practical difficulties of the first approach arising from the different stages of \nbond market development and divergent regulations, the TA adopts the second approach. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million. It will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility9 and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency, and the TA will be administered by ADB\u2019s Office of \nRegional Economic Integration in coordination with ASEAN+3 under the ABMI task force 3 work \nplan. The design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1 will be used to track and evaluate \nprogress in implementation. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  require  30  person-months  of  international  consultancy  and  48  person-\nmonths of national consultancy. Consultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines  on the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended from time to time). The \ninternational  consultants  will  be  a  financial  legal  expert,  financial  information  technology \nspecialist, and custody business specialist. National consultants with experience administering \nTA  and  managing  website  databases  will  be  engaged.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months and is expected to begin in January 2012 \nand be completed by December 2013. The consultants will prepare draft reports on (i) the \nproposal and a road map for a common bond issuance program for sub-forum 1 and (ii) \ntransaction flows, a fit-and-gap analysis, and a road map to standardize flows surveyed for sub-\nforum  2.  After  incorporating  comments  from  member  countries,  another  survey  round  will \nvalidate the report and collected information based on the answers and information provided by \nABMF members and experts. The consultants will submit the final draft to ABMI task force 3 by \nthe third quarter of 2012. The progress of the TA will be discussed at the ABMI task force 3 \nmeeting and reported to the ABMI steering meeting. The results and outputs will be shared with \nmarket  participants  and  officials  of  ABMI  member  countries  and  other  countries  through \ndissemination seminars and workshops. \n \nIV.
