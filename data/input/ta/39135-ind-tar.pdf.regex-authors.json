The Government of India and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) discussed a possible \nprogram in integrated coastal management (ICM) and related infrastructure development during \nthe Country Strategy and Program Update Mission in May 2004, and included this advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) in the 2005 program during the Country Program Confirmation Mission \nin December 2004. The TA was prepared on the basis of a consultation mission in September \n2004 and a fact-finding mission in March\u2013April 2005.1 The impacts, outcome, outputs, and \nactivities are summarized in the TA design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Two concurrent but somewhat distinct activities served as catalysts for this initiative. The \nfirst was a review of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification process by the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forests (MOEF); and the second was an effort by the Ministry of Water \nResources  (MOWR)  to  consolidate  state-level  coastal  erosion  protection  proposals  into  a \nsystematic national coastal protection program.2 The relevance of ICM as a strategy to address \nmultiple development objectives within a specified coastal area had been demonstrated through \na small-scale pilot program in the state of Kerala under an earlier ADB regional TA.3 Several \nother  states  have  also  undertaken  coastal  area  management  initiatives\u2014mostly  under  aid-\nassisted projects\u2014and have adopted variations of ICM strategies in selected localities. However, \nthere continues to be a need for better coordination in implementing multiple development and \nconservation activities within the coastal zone throughout India. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Coastal  Regulation  Zone  Notification  and  Emerging  Developments.  India  has  a \ncoastline of about 7,500 kilometers (km), of which about 5,400 km surrounds the mainland. The \nremaining 2,100 km includes the shoreline of the Lakshwadeep and the Andaman and Nicobar \nislands. With nearly 250 million people, or around 20% of the population, living within a distance \nof 50 km of  the shoreline, the population density of coastal areas (432 persons per square \nkilometer [km2]) is significantly higher than that of the country as a whole (256 persons per km2). \nThe majority of coastal communities derive a livelihood from fisheries, agriculture, or tourism and \nrelated services. At the same time coastal areas support significant industrial and commercial \nactivities and many urban centers. These multiple objectives and competing demands on the \ncoastal zone require a coordinated management strategy. \n \n4.  India\u2019s coastal areas fall under the jurisdiction of the CRZ Notification, which was issued \nin February 1991 under the Environmental (Protection) Act (No. 29 of 1986). The notification \naims to regulate activities of the area defined as the CRZ.4 The CRZ of each state is mapped out \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 28 January 2005. \n2  Integrated coastal management (ICM) encompasses a broad legal and institutional framework. It is substantially \ndifferent from the current coastal regulation zone (CRZ)  notification process,  which  is primarily a (reactive) \nmechanism for approving development activities in the CRZ. \n3  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Coastal and Marine Resources Management and Poverty Alleviation in South \nAsia. Manila. \n4  The CRZ is defined as coastal stretches of seas, bays, estuaries, creeks, rivers and backwaters that are influenced \nby tidal action (on the landward side). The area extending 500 meters (m) landward from the high-tide line (HTL) \nand the land between the low-tide line (LTL) and the HTL, including 500 m along tidal influenced water bodies to a \nminimum width of 100 m (whichever is less), are considered the CRZ. The CRZ is divided into four categories based \non ecological, geomorphologic, and socio-demographic features: (i) CRZ I covers ecologically sensitive or important \nareas; (ii) CRZ II covers areas that are already developed; (iii) CRZ III comprises rural and less developed areas; \nand (iv) CRZ IV covers the coastal stretches of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshwadeep, and some other \nislands. \n ", "2   \nin  the  respective  state  coastal  zone  management  plan  (CZMP).5  Implementation  of  the \nnotification is vested in the state Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Authority. However, most \nstates have found it challenging to enforce the notification due to several reasons: (i) inadequate \nstaff and resources in state CZM authorities; (ii) inconsistency between actual ground conditions \nand  the  classification  of  areas  by  CRZ  category  in  state  CZMPs;  (iii)  inadequate  data  to \ndemarcate the high-tide line (HTL), low-tide line (LTL), and other features of the coastal zone; \nand (iv) confusion over the notification due to numerous amendments that have been approved \nto grant exemptions for selected activities. \n \n5.  In July 2004, MOEF commissioned an Expert Committee to review the CRZ Notification \nprocess and propose remedial measures to improve its effectiveness. The report of the Expert \nCommittee,6 which was completed in February 2005, highlighted the importance of establishing \nscientific principles in CZM. In particular, it recommended (i) introducing a zoning scheme that \ncomplements development trends and ensures protection of ecologically sensitive areas; (ii) \nestablishing coastal setbacks, particularly in respect of dwellings and important infrastructure; (iii) \nbasing such setbacks on vulnerability criteria;7 and (iv) adopting principles of ICM as the means \nto encompass all of the above strategies and guide overall management of the coastal zone. The \nCRZ  Notification  is  due  to  be  revised  on  the  basis  of  these  recommendations  MOEF  has \nestablished technical working groups to flesh out the broad recommendations of the Expert \nCommittee. The notification is likely to be revised before the end of 2005.  \n6.  Revisions to the CRZ Notification in the manner described above will have significant \nimplications for states. Shifting from the current prescriptive approach of the CRZ Notification to \nan ICM approach will fundamentally change the regulatory framework, from being precautionary \nand reactive to being enabling and proactive. States will bear greater responsibility and authority \nfor coastal zone planning and management. In particular, the preparation and implementation of \nICM plans will require establishing procedures and mechanisms for cross-sectoral coordination \nand multisectoral planning. Effective ICM also requires delegation of appropriate functions and \nresponsibilities to local authorities. These changes will have implications for the institutional, \nfinancial, and technical capacity of states. They will also have a bearing on legal provisions that \ngovern relevant activities in the coastal areas.    \n7.  Coastal Protection Measures. Coastal erosion and related damage to settlements, \ninfrastructure and livelihood are pervasive in the coastal states of India. In extreme weather \nevents, such as during cyclones and tsunamis, such damage includes loss of lives as well. The \ntsunami of December 2004 dramatically illustrated the vulnerability of coastal communities and \ninfrastructure to the ravages of the ocean.  \n8.  Coastal protection measures adopted in India consist primarily of structural interventions \n(i.e., groins and seawalls). In Kerala, for instance, seawalls cover over half the coastline. Coastal \nprotection works must be strategically designed and constructed to avoid shifting the erosion \nproblem to another location further along the coastline. Similarly, it is widely believed that a \ncombination of structural (e.g., seawalls, groins, beach nourishment) and nonstructural (e.g., \nmangroves  and  other  shelter  belts,  setbacks)  interventions  could  be  more  economical, \nenvironmentally and socially acceptable and perhaps equally effective in protecting the coastline. \n                                                 \n5  A Supreme Court ruling on 29 January 1996 mandated all states to prepare CZMPs classifying coastal areas into \nthe specified CRZ categories. The CZMPs were prepared hastily and contain many inconsistencies.  \n6  Report of the committee chaired by Prof. M. S. Swaminathan to Review the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification \n1991, submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Forest, February 2005. \n7  The report of the Expert Committee defines vulnerability by seven parameters relating to geomorphologic and ocean \nconditions. \n ", "  3\nDue to lack of technical knowledge and experience, however, interventions have been limited to \nthe conventional techniques of groins and seawalls.  \n9.  In a recent initiative, MOWR has begun to consolidate proposals for coastal protection \nworks submitted by states. The proposals are being reviewed from a broader perspective, taking \ninto consideration the dynamics of larger coastal systems. This initiative provides an opportunity \nto consider alternative coastal protection measures that can achieve the same intended level of \nprotection. Alternatives could include a combination of structural and nonstructural measures. \nAlternative coastal protection measures must be evaluated in the context of coastal vulnerability. \nAssessing vulnerability and deciding on corresponding land uses will be a central activity in \npreparing ICM plans. Hence coastal protection measures, particularly structural measures, must \nbe consistent with ICM plans.  \n10.  Past ICM projects, including several ADB projects have revealed lessons that can serve \nto guide the TA. Some key lessons are as follows:8 (i) ICM initiatives that depend solely on \nexternal  financing  lead  to  creation  of  unsustainable  institutional  and  implementation \narrangements that often cease to function when the funding is withdrawn; (ii) ICM projects \nshould aim to institute ICM processes that are supported by stable technical and financial \nresources; (iii) sustainability of ICM initiatives is strongly linked to the presence of an enabling \nlegal framework; (iv) it must be recognized that community-based approaches are essential for \nmanagement decision making at the appropriate level; and (v) commitment and accountability to \nthe ICM process at all levels of government are essential for sustainability of such initiatives. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will contribute toward improved sustainable development of India\u2019s coastal zone.  \nIt  will  demonstrate  the  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  framework  required  to  facilitate \ndevelopment and conservation of the coastal zone in an integrated manner. The TA will aim to \nachieve  this  outcome  by  delivering  two  specific  outputs.  First,  it  will  support  a  process  to \nestablish  the  institutional  framework  for  implementing  ICM  at  the  state  level  through \ndemonstration in the state of Kerala. Based on experience with this exercise, the TA will produce \na report assessing the viability of ICM as a strategy applicable to any state in general. Second, \nthe  TA  will  support  an  assessment  of  coastal  protection  measures  taking  all  options  into \nconsideration, and report on the viability of alternative strategies. While these outputs are distinct \nin substance, it is expected that the procedures adopted in achieving them will converge, and \nhelp build consensus on an integrated development framework for coastal management.9 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  As noted (para.11), the TA will deliver two outputs. The first will be to establish and, by \ndoing so, demonstrate the practical implications of undertaking ICM at the level of a state \ngovernment.  It  will  involve  a  situation  analysis  of  development  and  conservation  programs \napplicable  to  the  coastal  zone  in  the  state  of  Kerala  and  the  corresponding  policy  and \ninstitutional environments. Next, key elements of an ICM framework will be used to assess policy \nand institutional gaps. Key activities will include (i) reviewing existing policy and institutional \narrangements; (ii) establishing appropriate arrangements at the level of the state and the local \n                                                 \n8 For a comprehensive review of ICM projects in developing countries, see Christie, P. 2005. Is Integrated Coastal \nManagement Sustainable? Ocean and Coastal Management. 48: 208-232. \n9 A project preparatory technical assistance (TA) of $1 million is listed in 2006 to prepare a project for ICM and coastal \nprotection. The outcome of the present TA will determine the viability and scope of the follow-on TA.  \n ", "4   \ngovernment to facilitate ICM; (iii) undertaking preliminary substantive activities related to ICM \nplanning; (iv) assessing the replicability of arrangements in Kerala through comparison with \ncorresponding  arrangements  in  the  state  of  Tamil  Nadu;  and  (v)  liaising  with  MOEF  on \ncorresponding revisions to the CRZ Notification.  \n13.  The second output relating to the assessment of coastal protection measures will involve \na technical analysis of various options. Empirical evidence from reviewing existing measures and \nexperimental  work  in  India  will  be  supplemented  with  information  on  alternative  strategies \nadopted  under  similar  conditions  elsewhere  in  the  region.  The  analysis  will  constitute  a \npreliminary feasibility study of alternative strategies and form the basis for considering a range of \ncoastal protection measures suitable for different scenarios.  \n14.  The TA aims to incorporate lessons from previous projects, which were summarized in \npara.10. As stated in para. 11, the expected outcome of the TA is to demonstrate an acceptable \nframework for ICM, which is supported at the national level and adopted at the state and local \nlevels. Commitment to such a process should be the basis for continuing the ICM programs. The \nTA will contribute toward the ongoing revisions of the CRZ Notification, and thereby assist in \ncreating an enabling legal framework. The TA\u2019s recommendations for continued support of ICM \nactivities will hinge on progress achieved on the above fronts. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $294,500 equivalent, comprising foreign currency \nof $100,000 and local currency equivalent of $194,500. The total foreign currency component \nand $150,000 equivalent of the local currency cost will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom. The Government of India will contribute the equivalent of \n$44,500 through in-kind contributions as indicated in the detailed cost table in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The detailed TA activities relating to ICM will be undertaken largely at the state and local \ngovernment levels. Kerala will serve as the focal state in terms of the detailed assessments. \nWithin the state government structure, the state planning board is responsible for promoting \ncross-disciplinary and innovative initiatives. Accordingly, the Kerala State Planning Board will \nserve as the Implementing Agency of the TA. The TA will draw heavily from past and ongoing \nCZM programs in other states, particularly in Tamil Nadu. Such cross-state comparisons will \nserve to broaden the TA recommendations on ICM and ensure greater applicability across \nstates. In Tamil Nadu, the state Department of Environment will serve as a focal agency for the \nTA. \n17.  TA activities relating to the assessment of alternative coastal protection measures will be \nsupervised  by  MOWR.  The  technical  analysis  will  be  based  on  existing  structures  and \nexperimental sites within Kerala and Tamil Nadu to the extent possible. But a limited number of \nsites outside those states may also be included to ensure a comprehensive assessment of \nalternatives and conditions representative of the entire coastline. MOWR will give guidance in \nselecting appropriate sites.  \n18.  Although the detailed work of the TA will focus on the state and local levels, it will \nfacilitate a process of dialogue at the national level with a view to reaching strategic policy \ndirectives on adopting ICM as a development framework. In this context, MOEF will serve as the \nExecuting Agency of the TA.  Since ICM directives require consensus across conventional sector \nlines, the planning commission may be required to assume a facilitation role at strategic points \nduring TA implementation. \n ", "  5\n19.  The TA will be implemented over 4 months, starting in December 2005 and ending in \nApril 2006 (Appendix 3). The TA will require 5 person-months of international and 9 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services in the areas of ICM and structural and nonstructural \ncoastal protection. The international consultants will be hired as individuals following ADBs \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The contract for domestic consultants and other TA inputs \nwill be awarded by direct selection to the Center for Earth Sciences (CESS), a Kerala-based \nresearch institute with a strong background in coastal management and related fields. CESS will \nfacilitate the state and national workshops and seminars of the TA relating to policy dialogue and \nformulation of institutional arrangements. The consultants will submit, as a team, an inception \nreport within 1 month of TA start-up, a policy brief at the end of 3 months, and a final report \ncontaining  the  TA  recommendations  after  the  fourth  month.  The  terms  of  reference  of  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.
