The Project will be \nopen to all eligible DMCs that might need emergency or additional \nsupport for the avian influenza epidemic.  \n \nThe Project has four components, to be implemented over 2.5 \nyears: (i) regional capacity building, (ii) regional coordination, (iii) \navian influenza response facility, and (iv) project management. \nGiven the need for flexibility and rapid response, subprojects will \nbe  developed  during  project  implementation  according  to  the \nneeds. \n \nThe Project, implemented in close coordination with other national \nand  international  initiatives,  will  improve  capacity  for  regional \nsurveillance  and  regional  and  national  response  to  emerging \ndiseases. \n   \nRationale  The potential impact of an influenza pandemic is substantial and \ncould halt economic growth and poverty reduction. Experts fear \nthat  the  highly  pathogenic  avian  influenza  virus  A  H5N1  may \nmutate and cause a human influenza pandemic. All countries are \nat  risk.  Addressing  the  risk  or  at  least  reducing  the  potential \nimpact of an influenza pandemic is a regional public good. The \nProject will contribute to overall efforts to combat avian influenza \nand other emerging diseases. It will fill an important niche by ", "  iii\n \nsupporting coordination and regional activities. The Project will \nhelp establish systems to prevent and control emerging diseases, \nwhich will be useful even if the epidemic does not escalate. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  aims  to  help  significantly  control  and  reduce  the \nspread of H5N1 avian influenza among poultry, and increase the \nregion's preparedness for a potential human influenza pandemic, \nthereby preventing or mitigating social and economic disruptions \nin Asia and the Pacific region. This will be achieved by helping \nDMCs prevent or rapidly control infection-at-source among birds \nby  strengthening  systems  and  incentives  for  early  detection, \nreporting and controlling avian influenza outbreaks, and rapidly \ncontaining and managing cases of human influenza caused by the \nH5N1 virus. The Project will also help prepare the region for a \npossible  pandemic  by  supporting  regional  interagency \ncollaboration,  regional  cooperation  in  sharing  information,  and \nupgrading  of  national  capacities  through  strengthened  regional \nnetworks. \n   \nCost Estimates   \nComponent  Total Cost   \nA.

All grants will be with terms and conditions substantially \n ", "iv   \n \nin accordance with those set out in the grant agreement presented \nto the Board of Directors. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  28 February 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 August 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented by ADB, in close coordination \nArrangements  with qualified regional and technical partners such as ASEAN, \nFAO, and WHO. An avian influenza secretariat to administer the \nProject will be established in the Gender, Social Development and \nCivil Society Division of the Regional Sustainable Development \nDepartment.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  ADB, acting through the avian influenza secretariat, will be the \nExecuting Agency for the Project. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  by  international  organizations,  including  ASEAN, \nFAO,  and  WHO,  will  be  done  according  to  their  procurement \npolicies,  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  will  pay  standard  and \nreasonable administrative charges to implementing international \norganizations. Participating DMCs and ADB will identify a national \nimplementing  agency  (or  agencies)  for  procurement,  following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the processes outlined in \nADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  Subject  to \nagreement  by  the  participating  DMCs  and  ADB,  international \nshopping procedures or local competitive bidding, with procedures \nacceptable to ADB, may be used for contracts of $200,000 or \nmore, and direct purchase for contracts worth less than $200,000. \nTo ensure a balance between protection of intellectual property \nrights, equity, quality, and economy, all implementing agencies \nwill use FAO and WHO guidelines (as appropriate) to procure \npharmaceutical and laboratory products.  \n \nGiven  the  need  to  coordinate  closely  with  other  international \norganizations, to respond quickly to changing needs of the region, \nand to facilitate work with potential cofinanciers, the procurement \nof goods and services shall be open to suppliers in member and \nnonmember  countries,  subject  to  approval  by  the  Board  of \nDirectors. \n   \nConsulting Services  Most consultants will be contracted by participating international \norganizations  or  by  participating  DMCs.  ADB  will  contract  \nconsultants for project administration and, if requested, may also \ncontract consultants directly for the use of DMCs and international \norganization. The Project will finance an estimated 651 person-\nmonths of consulting services through components 1, 2, and 4. \nAdditional  consultants  may  be  recruited  under  component  3. \nInternational  organizations  will  use  their  own  recruitment \nprocedures,  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  recruit  international \n ", "  v\n \nconsultants.  DMCs  will  recruit  consultants  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants or other procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy, ADB will ensure that consultant \nrecruitment  is  flexible  and  efficient.  Consultants  may  be \nindividuals and  firms  from  member  and  nonmember  countries, \nsubject to the approval by the Board of Directors. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Regional Public Goods. Controlling avian influenza is a regional \nBeneficiaries   public good. The actions of individual countries, although critical, \nare not sufficient to end the risk that avian influenza poses to \nanimals  and  humans.  Only  by  cooperating  can  countries \neffectively  combat  this  threat.  The  Project  will  focus  on \nstrengthening the regional response to avian influenza, including \nreinforcing  links  among  countries,  sharing  information  and \nexpertise, and facilitating risk pooling and stockpiling.  \n \nTechnical Capacity Building. The Project will contribute to the \nlong-term  strengthening  of  the  epidemiological  surveillance \nsystem and to national and regional preparedness for outbreaks \nof  zoonosis  and  other  communicable  diseases  (including \ntraditional, reemerging, and emerging diseases). The Project will \nsupport training in animal and human health, which will be useful \nafter the current outbreak of avian influenza.  \n \nSocial  Benefits.  Controlling  the  spread  of  avian  influenza  in \npoultry  flocks  will  significantly  improve  the  welfare  of  rural \nhouseholds in the region. The epidemic is harming small-scale \npoultry farmers and threatens the livelihoods of many poor and \nnear-poor households. Reducing the risk of the further spread of \nthe disease through improved farming methods and biosecurity, \nand helping establish sustainable schemes to compensate and \nassist small-scale and backyard poultry owners will help mitigate \nthe negative impact of avian influenza. A related human influenza \npandemic would slow down poverty reduction. The livelihoods and \nhealth of poor households would be most at risk. The poor have \nlimited access to the health system and would probably delay \nusing health services, which might result in a more severe illness \nthat could send them deeper into poverty. Therefore, prevention of \na human influenza epidemic will more than proportionately benefit \nthe poor.  \n \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  Project,  in  coordination  with  other \nglobal, regional, and national initiatives, will lower the probability \nof  an  H5N1-related  pandemic  occurring  and  will  minimize  the \neconomic impact if one does occur. Estimates show that the cost \nof such a pandemic would be $100 billion\u2013$300 billion for Asia \nand the Pacific region (excluding Japan).  \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  regional  cooperation,  transparency, \nexchange  of  information,  expertise,  and  response  capacity. \n ", "vi   \n \nIncreased  trust  and  cooperation  will  help  foster  regional \nintegration and economic growth.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Epidemiological Uncertainty. H5N1 avian influenza remains a \nzoonosis (an animal disease that may affect humans), affecting \npoultry and wild birds but rarely transmitted to humans. The three \ninfluenza pandemics of the 20th century also originated among \nbirds, caused by an avian virus that mutated into a virus that was \ntransmitted efficiently among humans. There is no certainty that \nthis will occur with the H5N1 virus, although experts believe that a \npandemic\u2014caused  by  a  mutated  H5N1  or  another  strain  of \ninfluenza  virus\u2014is  inevitable.  Influenza  pandemics  can  vary \nwidely in virulence and efficiency in spreading among humans. \nThey may affect different age groups differently. The efforts of the \nProject to control H5N1 influenza may appear ineffective if this \nparticular virus never mutates into a human virus or if the related \nhuman  influenza  pandemic  is  mild.  The  Project  however  will \nstrengthen regional cooperation and health systems and better \nprepare  the  region  for  emerging  or  reemerging  communicable \ndiseases.  \n \nDonor Coordination. Because the threat of a human influenza \npandemic is global, interest is growing in supporting measures \nagainst  H5N1  avian  influenza.  Many  bilateral  and  multilateral \nagencies  have  offered  assistance  to  governments,  which  also \ndevelop their own initiatives. Given these multiple partners, efforts \nmight be duplicated and governments may not have the capacity \nto manage the offered assistance. The Project\u2019s primary goal is to \nimprove  regional  coordination,  including  in  developing \npreparedness plans and surveillance, to allow countries to take \nfull advantage of global support.  \n \nLow Demand. Avian influenza is a major concern of governments \nthroughout  the  world.  However,  they  may  lose  interest as  the \nH5N1 virus evolves or as some other event takes center stage. As \na result, ADB may commit significant resources and not be able to \nreallocate them to other priorities. In designing the Project, ADB \nhas shown significant flexibility and it would be able to quickly \nadjust the Project. The Project is short, which assures the quick \nreturn of unused funds for other uses. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed  \ngrants  to  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Secretariat,  the  Food  and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), \nand participating developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor the Prevention and Control of Avian Influenza in Asia and the Pacific Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Avian influenza A H5N12 poses a major development challenge to Asia and the Pacific \nregion. This highly pathogenic virus has infected poultry in many Asian countries and has \nbecome endemic in large parts of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia, and Viet \nNam. The virus has now been detected in birds and humans in Turkey and has spread to parts \nof Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia.  Experts believe that the virus could mutate \nor reassort and develop a new subtype that is easily transmittable among humans, leading to an \ninfluenza  pandemic.  Every  case  of  animal-to-human  transmission  gives  the  virus  another \nchance to mutate into a human-to-human transmissible virus.  \n \n3.  WHO uses a series of six phases of pandemic alert to classify the seriousness of the \nthreat and to determine whether to launch progressively more intense control and prevention \nactivities. Determining the phases and deciding when to move from one phase to another may \nbe triggered by several factors, including the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and \nthe circulating influenza viruses. As of 1 March 2006, the world has been in phase 3: a new \ninfluenza virus against which humans have no immunity is circulating, but it is not yet spreading \nfrom humans to humans. WHO considers the world to be the closest to a global influenza \npandemic since 1968.3 \n \n4.  The region faces three types of threats from H5N1 influenza. First, the virus is already \nendemic and virulent in poultry in many countries, putting at risk the poultry industry and the \nlivelihoods of many small-scale producers. Second, the health of poultry workers and their \nfamilies is at risk. It is difficult for humans to contract avian influenza in its current form, and the \nnumber of reported human cases has been low and mostly confined to those in close contact \nwith poultry. However, once contracted, avian influenza has proven highly dangerous: about half \nthe people reported to be infected have died. Third, the H5N1 virus could mutate into a form that \nis easily transmissible among humans, creating a pandemic that would put at risk the lives of \nmillions of people across the globe and halt the region\u2019s economic progress.  \n \n5.  In response to this mounting threat and to growing requests for support from DMCs, \nADB has entered into partnership with ASEAN, FAO, and WHO to develop a flexible and urgent \nresponse. The Project will support regional activities to contain the spread of avian influenza \n                                                 \n1  Support for the preparation of this Project was provided by RETA 6108 (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for \nEmergency Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Manila); \nRETA  6194  (ADB.  2004  Technical  Assistance  for  Preparing  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional \nCommunicable  Disease  Control  Project.

", "2   \namong poultry, to prevent the outbreak of a human influenza pandemic, and to prepare the \nregion for a potential pandemic. It will complement country-level support. The major outbreaks \namong birds and all human cases to date have occurred in Asia. Controlling the outbreaks will \nhelp protect populations in Asia and the Pacific region and beyond.  \n \n6.  Prevention of avian and human influenza is a public good. No country, on its own, can \ncombat its spread. Migratory birds are carriers of the disease and may infect domestic birds, \nraising the risk of the virus reappearing where it has been eliminated. Migratory flocks can \nspread the virus widely and have carried it to Africa, Central Asia, Europe, and South Asia. \nCountries are closely interlinked through globalization and cannot shut down their borders to \npotential carriers of human influenza. Thus, all countries have an interest in ensuring that each \ncountry can respond suitably and effectively.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Background \n7.  Social and Economic Impact. In the past 2 years, avian influenza has affected birds \nthroughout Asia, significantly dislocating the poultry sector. In the Mekong subregion alone, the \noutbreak is estimated to have cost about $580 million through March 2005, excluding the loss \ncaused by trade restrictions.4 FAO has estimated the total cost of the outbreak at around $10 \nbillion.5 Many countries have had to cull large numbers of poultry to control the spread of the \nvirus. Poultry is a major source of income and nutrition for many rural households in Asia. The \nloss of poultry to disease and culling has pushed many families into poverty. The international \ntrade in poultry products has been greatly harmed and the exports from a number of major \npoultry-raising countries severely reduced.  \n \n8.  Human  Impact.  As  of  1  March  2006,  WHO  confirmed  174  human  cases,  with  94 \nfatalities.6 Humans primarily contract avian influenza from close and direct contact with birds \n(mostly poultry), with few confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission.7 Although the \nH5N1  virus  would  have  to  mutate  or  recombine  with  existing  human  influenza  viruses  to \nfacilitate human-to-human transmission, experts are worried about the high mortality rate in \nhumans and the virus\u2019 efficiency in spreading among different bird populations. Appendix 2 \noutlines the epidemiology of influenza and its impact on human health.  \n \n2.  Human Influenza Pandemic \n9.  Historical Context. Influenza is highly contagious and spreads easily across borders \namong humans. Seasonal influenza is a common disease affecting a large number of people \nevery year. The mortality rate tends to be low, with mainly the very young, the elderly, and other \nvulnerable populations at risk. Still, in a typical year, 600,000 to 1.5 million die worldwide from \nseasonal influenza. Humans develop immunity against the virus, and vaccines are available, but \nthe virus changes slightly every year and the vaccine needs to be adapted. Every year, WHO, \nwith the assistance of collaborating centers, defines the content of the annual vaccine, using the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005.

Avian Flu A (H5N1) Infection in Humans. New England Journal of Medicine. 353: 1374\u20131385.  \n ", "  3\nmost likely strains of the virus in the following influenza season. Periodically, a completely new \nstrain appears, against which the annual vaccine will not protect. The influenza outbreaks \ncaused by new strains are often more virulent, with a higher case fatality rate. Developing, \nproducing, and distributing a vaccine against a new strain normally takes 4 to 6 months.  \n \n10.  The 20th century saw three influenza pandemics, in 1918\u20131919, 1957\u20131958, and 1968\u2013\n1969. The 1918\u20131919 pandemic, commonly called the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d was one of the worst health \ncatastrophes ever. An estimated 50 million to 100 million people died, representing a fatality \nrate of 2.5% to 5.0%.8 This rate was unusually high because of several factors, at the end of the \nFirst World War, including the (i) poor public health conditions, (ii) low nutritional levels, (iii) large \nmovements of populations as troops were demobilized, and (iv).lack of medication to treat \nsecondary bacterial infections (antibiotics were only released on the pharmaceutical market in \n1939). The two other influenza pandemics killed substantially fewer people, about 1 million to 3 \nmillion people. All three influenza pandemics, generally believed to have originated in Asia, \nwere caused by mutated or recombined avian viruses. \n \n11.  Consequences of a Pandemic. It is not possible to predict how and when an influenza \nvirus will mutate and how virulent the new strain will be. It appears difficult for human to catch \nH5N1  from  animal-to-human  transmission  as  relatively  few  people  have  been  infected. \nHowever, each human infection give the virus the opportunity to mutate (as happened with the \nSpanish flu) or recombine with seasonal human influenza virus strains (as happened with the \nother two pandemics), and thereby spread more easily among humans. Although it is difficult to \npredict the virulence of a new human-to-human transmissible influenza virus, WHO estimates \nthat from 2 million to 7 million people could die worldwide from an influenza pandemic. This is \nequivalent to a mortality rate of 0.03% to 0.12% and is the basis for planning in many countries. \nHowever, others point to the high pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus and project a mortality of 180 \nmillion to 360 million (mortality rates of 3% to 6%) or even higher.9  \n \n12.  The world has changed significantly since the last pandemic in 1968. Economies are \nmuch  more  interlinked,  information  flows  more  freely,  and  the  movement  of  people  has \nincreased dramatically. The world is much more vulnerable to economic shocks. The outbreak \nof SARS10 in 2003, for example, ultimately infected only some 8,000 people, with a case fatality \nrate of around 10%, concentrated in a few, mostly Asian, countries. Because of the strong world \nreaction, however, several economies were severely affected. The region lost around $18 billion \nin economic output.11 Since the actual health consequences were minimal, this cost was largely \ncaused by the outbreak\u2019s psychological impact on demand. The public\u2019s reaction to outbreaks of \nmad  cow  disease  (bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy)  and  foot-and-mouth  disease \ndemonstrate a marked tendency to overreact to public health threats.  \n \n13.  The impact of an influenza pandemic would be even worse. Using the SARS outbreak \nas a model, an ADB study has estimated that an outbreak consistent with the WHO baseline \ncould  cost  the  region  $297  billion  in  1  year  and  would  throw  the  world  into  economic \nrecession.12 This is largely because consumption would slow down; trade of services, including \n                                                 \n8  Barry, J. 2005. 1918 Revisited: Lessons and Suggestions for Further in Inquiry.

This type of outbreak would lead to around 3 million \ndeaths in Asia, the equivalent of 45.6 million life years lost, causing lost income of $267 billion. \nAnother 20.8 million life years would be lost because of temporary incapacity. If the international \ncommunity can contain the panic, the economic consequences would be substantially reduced.  \n \n3.  Strategy for Combating Avian and Human Influenza \n14.  Governments and development partners agree that the rapid control and containment of \navian influenza should remain a global priority. To coordinate the response to this emerging \nchallenge, a number of high-level international meetings have been held. A major meeting took \nplace in WHO headquarters in Geneva on 7\u20139 November 2005, with representatives from most \nWHO member countries, bilateral donors, and international agencies. The meeting identified \npriority interventions to control avian influenza and improve preparedness for a possible human \ninfluenza pandemic. \n \n15.  Containing Infection at Source. There is wide agreement that the best strategy to \nprevent a pandemic is to contain the threat at source, when it still affects mainly the bird \npopulations.  This  involves  (i)  enhancing  biosecurity  in  the  poultry  sector  to  prevent  new \ninfections of birds, (ii) timely notification and verification of avian influenza outbreaks in domestic \nand wild birds, and (iii) rapid containment through culling and vaccination. In the long term, \ncountries in the region should improve the safety of poultry farming and marketing. In the short \nterm, early warning and surveillance systems for animal diseases are critical. With livestock \nfarmers,  especially  in  backyard  poultry  farming,  at  the  frontline,  providing  appropriate \ncompensation is an important incentive to ensure their active participation. Transparent and \nimmediate reporting by authorities is essential, as is the sharing of virus samples to rapidly \nidentify the virus subtype and prepare a human vaccine. \n \n16.  Preparing for a Human Influenza Pandemic. While working on the primary strategy of \nminimizing the threat at source, countries and international partners also committed to prevent \nor delay13 a human influenza pandemic. This requires coordinated national, regional, and global \nefforts to quickly detect mutations of the circulating avian influenza viruses and to limit the \noutbreaks. The international community identified five key strategic actions:  \n \n(i)  Reduce human exposure to the H5N1 virus through risk communication and \nstrengthened collaboration between animal and human health services. \n(ii)  Strengthen  an  early  warning  system  by  supporting  systems  for  sensitive \ndetection,  rapid  laboratory  confirmation,  real-time  risk  assessments,  and \nimmediate communication. \n(iii)  Intensify  rapid  containment  measures  by  supporting  rapid  field  investigation, \ncontact tracing and monitoring, stringent infection control, and intervention with \ninternational stockpile following the first signs that the virus is transmitting from \nhumans to humans. \n(iv)  Build capacity to cope with a pandemic by developing national plans, testing and \nrehearsing them, and developing the capacity to implement them. \n(v)  Accelerate vaccine development and expand production capacity by enhancing \ncoordination with the pharmaceutical industry, strengthening real-time scientific \ndata,  accessing  global  expertise,  and  providing  incentives  to  the  industry  to \nproduce sufficient quantities of vaccines. \n \n                                                 \n13  Delaying or slowing down the spread of a pandemic will save millions of lives by buying time to develop a vaccine. \n ", "  5\n4.  Regional and National Needs  \n17.  Avian influenza has already had a significant economic impact, and a pandemic would \nseverely tax the capacity of most public health systems in the region. To control the spread of \navian influenza and to prevent and mitigate a pandemic, significant new national, regional, and \nglobal resources are needed (Appendix 3).  \n \n18.  Regional technical agencies need to be strengthened so that they can effectively support \ncountries in the current pre-pandemic stage. Greater regional cooperation is needed in sharing \ninformation  and  training,  and  strengthening  networks  for  epidemiological  surveillance  and \nlaboratory testing. If a pandemic breaks out, national and regional emergency response teams \nand stockpiles of essential drugs and equipment will be needed. After an outbreak, countries will \nneed support for recovery.  \n \n19.  In  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region,  largely  corresponding  to  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  FAO  has \nestimated an unmet need of around $18.6 million for regional activities and $29.0 million for \nsupport to regional reference laboratories. WHO has estimated regional needs of about $37.0 \nmillion for human health activities. These estimates exclude global activities. Since most of the \ncases of avian influenza (in birds and humans) have been in the region, a large part of global \nsupport will likely directly benefit it.  \n \n20.  Estimations of national demand for resources are still speculative, as the spread of avian \ninfluenza is still not clear. The World Bank has estimated that countries in East and South Asia \nwill need around $711 million and have an internal capacity to finance 30% to 50% of this \namount. Central Asia will likely need around $45 million and could finance $10 million to $15 \nmillion. These figures probably underestimate the needs of the health sector and perhaps also \nthe needs of the animal health system in a country where avian influenza becomes endemic.  \n \n5.  International Response  \n21.  Governments and international organizations have committed significant technical and \nfinancial resources to fight avian influenza among birds and to prevent or halt its spread among \nhumans. Appendix 4 outlines international support for fighting avian and human influenza. \nInternational agencies are developing global, regional, and national financing and monitoring \nframeworks. In January 2006, a major conference was held in Beijing to pledge support for \nglobal, regional, and national pandemic preparedness plans.  \n \n22.  At the Beijing conference, development partners pledged about $1.9 billion, including \nsupport that has been disbursed and support that is in the pipeline. Some of the support is from \nmultilateral financing agencies such as ADB, the World Bank, and the European Commission, \nand from bilateral sources, including development agencies and national technical agencies, \nsuch as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States and France's \nPasteur Institutes.  \n \na.  International and Regional Organizations \n23.  Asian Development Bank. ADB has been active in the health sector in a number of \ncountries in Asia and the Pacific region, including by supporting national and regional efforts to \ncontrol communicable diseases and by strengthening health surveillance and food safety. ADB \nhas pledged about $470 million for avian influenza prevention and control, including $68 million \nin grants, in two regional projects (including $10 million cofinancing from the Government of \n ", "6   \nJapan).  ADB  has  also  offered  about  $400  million  in  loans.  The  loan  amount  includes \nrestructuring existing loans to save money and expedite new loans. The grant projects are \nlargely for regional activities although they do finance some national activities. ADB has a \nnumber of ongoing projects and activities that will support efforts to control avian influenza.  \n \n24.  The Greater Mekong subregion14 has been the center of the outbreak of avian influenza \nand  is  the  focus  of  much  of  ADB\u2019s  attention.  The  Communicable  Disease  Control  (CDC) \nProject15 is a key regional initiative. It focuses on improving regional coordination and the \nprovision of regional public goods. It supports disease control, strengthens laboratories, and \nfocuses on controlling avian influenza. \n \n25.  World  Bank.  In  partnership  with  FAO  and  WHO,  the  World  Bank  leads  donor \ncoordination and resource mobilization. Its initial estimates of financial needs have been used to \nsolicit donor assistance. It established a finance facility that will offer concessionary or market-\nbased lending to countries, depending on country eligibility. This $500 million facility, approved \nin January 2006, will serve as the main source of funds. The World Bank is in the process of \nestablishing  a  multi-donor  trust  fund  to  provide  grant  assistance.  The  fund  has  received \ncommitments  from the European Commission and several other development partners.  \n \n26.  Food and Agricultural Organization and World Organization for Animal Health \n(OIE). FAO and OIE are working together to control avian influenza, containing infection at \nsource through progressive control of H5N1 avian influenza and its eradication from poultry \nflocks in Asia. Immediate actions include preparing emergency plans and establishing regional \nnetworks on surveillance, diagnostic, and disease information. Control measures include culling, \nbiosecurity, quarantine, and movement control, combined with strategic vaccination of domestic \npoultry.  FAO\u2019s  medium-term  strategy  is  to  help  countries  establish  disease-free  zones, \nprogressively confine the disease to defined areas, and ultimately eradicate the disease from \nremaining compartments of infected domestic poultry in the region by promoting healthy farming \npractices, wide-scale vaccination in the predominantly commercial and backyard poultry sectors, \nand strict post-vaccination monitoring.  \n \n27.  World  Health  Organization.  WHO  is  focusing  on  mitigating  the  impact  of  avian \ninfluenza  on  human  health  and  preventing  a  pandemic.  WHO  has  advocated  influenza \npandemic preparedness planning for all countries and recommended increased surveillance of \nthe H5N1 virus. Before the pandemic, interventions should aim to gather better intelligence on \nthe H5N1 virus, particularly on mutations in the virus genome and changes in the epidemiology \nof influenza outbreaks that may signal increased transmissibility of the virus. If an influenza virus \ncauses a pandemic (a new strain highly transmissible among humans), WHO's strategy will \ncontain or delay the spread of the virus at the source.16 If a pandemic begins, WHO will \ncoordinate international actions to reduce morbidity, mortality, and social disruption. WHO is \nsupporting pre-pandemic research to guide response measures. It is working closely with FAO \nand OIE to coordinate activities and technical advice. It is also promoting risk communication \nstrategies. \n   \n                                                 \n14 Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province and the \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the PRC.  \n15 ADB. 2005.

Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ASEAN members17 have been at the center \nof the avian influenza epidemic. The ASEAN Secretariat is developing its capacity to coordinate \na regional response to public health threats. It is supporting efforts to share information on avian \ninfluenza and is working with development partners to improve regional coordination.   \n \nb.  Country Responses \n29.  FAO, WHO, and other technical agencies emphasize that all countries and regions must \ndevelop comprehensive plans that integrate interventions related to animal and human health \nand  strengthen  surveillance  systems  and  response  mechanisms.  Countries  should  also \nconsider possible disruptions to essential services in case of a pandemic. These plans can \nbecome the basis for coordinated financial and technical support from bilateral donors and \ninternational agencies. \n \n30.  Although most countries in Asia and the Pacific region have plans to prevent a pandemic \nby  containing  avian  influenza  among  poultry,  and  to  manage  a  influenza  pandemic  if \ncontainment fails, the plans\u2019 quality and realism vary greatly. As recommended by the technical \nagencies, most of these plans have been prepared jointly by ministries of health and agriculture. \nCapacities to implement the plans also vary greatly. Most plans are not adequately resourced \nand most countries need more support to refine their strategies and to develop the technical and \nlogistical capacity to implement them.  \n \n31.  Regional Support. Japan is supporting national and regional initiatives directly through \nbilateral support and through a number of international and regional organizations. In particular, \nJapan  is  helping  establish  regional  stockpiles  for  antiviral  drugs  and  protective  personal \nequipment. It is providing $10 million to ADB to support regional activities, and $5 million to the \nWorld  Bank  for  its  grant  facility.  Japan  is  directly  supporting  FAO  and  WHO  and  is  also \nproviding  significant  support  to  UNICEF 18 /WHO  in  the  area  of  community-based  risk \ncommunication. In total, Japan has contributed around $135 million. Beyond its commitment to \nshare information with the international community, the Government of the PRC has pledged \n$10 million, mainly to support neighboring countries. Australia is providing around $75 million at \nthe national and regional levels.  \n \n32.  Europe. The European Union member states have been active in international support \nagainst avian influenza. The European Commission is planning to provide \u20ac80 million to the \nWorld Bank\u2019s grant facility, of which \u20ac35 million is destined for Asian countries (including Central \nAsia) and \u20ac20 million for vaccine research and development. Individually, member states are \npledging a total of $260 million for national, regional, and global support. A significant part of the \nEuropean countries' assistance will be allocated through international organizations.  \n \n33.  North America. The United States is the largest single contributor, with commitments of \n$334 million to fight avian influenza nationally, regionally, and globally. This includes research \nand development, and support to improve animal and human health, offered by a variety of \ngovernment departments and agencies. Canada, the only non-Asian country that was affected \nby SARS, is contributing around $30 million, focused largely on Asia. \n \n                                                 \n17 Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. All members, except Brunei, are also ADB members.  \n18 United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. \n ", "8   \nB.  Analysis of Key Challenges and Opportunities \n1.  Key Challenges \n34.  Health experts think that the world is at the greatest risk now of a human influenza \npandemic since 1968. Although it is not clear that the current H5N1 will lead to the next \npandemic, it does appear to be only a matter of time before a new influenza virus emerges. \nCoordinated action is needed to mitigate the impact of the avian influenza outbreaks and \nprevent a pandemic from this dangerous subtype.  \n \na.  Limited Government Surveillance Capacity  \n35.  Tracking and diagnosing diseases require established field and laboratory systems. \nLocal capacity is needed to monitor infectious diseases among animals and humans. This is \nlikely to be the responsibility of different agencies. Laboratories need to have adequate systems \nto  collect,  transport,  and  test  specimens,  and  they  require  adequate  biosafety  and  waste \ndisposal systems. Most developing countries have only limited resources for epidemiological \nand laboratory surveillance and response, and public health is largely under-funded. Countries \nwill need significant support from international organizations to strengthen their animal and \nhuman health systems.  \n \nb.   Evolving Regional Cooperation \n36.  One  of  the  major  lessons  from  the  SARS  outbreak  is  the  importance  of  regional \ncooperation in public health. The countries of Asia and the Pacific Region have committed \nthemselves to strengthen the exchange of information and to coordinate public health activities. \nHowever, this is a relatively new area and there is little experience on how to organize regional \ncooperation in the health sector. International organizations have generally focused on country-\nlevel activities but do have some experience in this area. Strengthening their capacity will \nrequire additional resources and support.   \n \nc.  Uncertain Nature of the Threat \n37.  Avian  influenza  has  already  done  significant  harm  to  the  region\u2019s  poultry  industry. \nHowever, the course of the H5N1 virus is uncertain. Although the H5N1 virus has proved to be \nhighly virulent for humans, it does not spread easily among humans in its present form. The \nappearance, through mutations or reassortment, of a new influenza virus easily transmissible \namong humans and thus causing a new pandemic, is considered likely, and H5N1 is a serious \ncandidate. But the time frame for such transformation is difficult to predict. The epidemiological \nproperties of this new pandemic strain cannot be known, which makes it difficult to design an \nadequate public health response. National health systems may overreact and over prepare, or \nfind that they are overwhelmed by the virus.  \n \n38.  Authorities need to pursue a dual strategy to prevent mutation or reassortment of the \nH5N1 virus and, at the same time, to prepare for a human influenza pandemic. Regional \norganizations can play an important role in planning and coordination, training and capacity \nbuilding, and stockpiling of critical commodities.  \n \n ", "  9\nd.  Low Preparedness for a Pandemic \n39.  Health systems in the region are unprepared for a pandemic. Health workers will need \nadequate protection (protective gear, vaccination). A large portion of the population may need to \nbe vaccinated. Sick people should receive antiviral treatments such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae), \nand antibiotics to treat secondary infections. For most cases, specialized equipment (such as \nventilators) will be needed. Many Asian countries have underinvested in health, and public \nspending on health is lower than in other regions. The last human influenza pandemic was in \n1968 and the last severe pandemic was in 1918. As a result, health workers, especially at the \nlocal level, at the frontline, have limited experience with influenza pandemics, and training lags \nin many countries.  \n \n40.  International  organizations  can  play  an  important  role  in  coordinating  activities  and \nplanning for a pandemic. Exchange of information, materials and experience, harmonization of \npublic health measures, and regional training activities will be essential to control a pandemic. \nCoordination is important because a pandemic will spread quickly across borders. Procurement \ncan be facilitated regionally for some goods and supplies. Medications and vaccines often have \nsignificant  economies  of  scale,  and  pooling  orders  may  substantially  reduce  the  cost. \nEstablishing regional stockpiles also makes economic sense as it allows countries to pool \nlimited resources to establish a system of rapid response to a human influenza outbreak. \n \ne.  Appropriate Incentives for Farmers \n41.  When combined with other measures, culling diseased flocks plays a major role in \npreventing the spread of avian influenza at its source. Culling has significant benefits for society \nbut a high cost for farmers, giving them little incentive to participate voluntarily. Governments \nmay try to force culling, but farmers often attempt to subvert it by hiding part of their flock or \nslaughtering poultry before the cull.  \n \n42.  Establishing appropriate and adequate compensation for farmers is complex. Planners \nmust carefully weigh the incentives that they are creating through the compensation mechanism. \nA system that it is too generous will encourage excessive culling and encourage farmers to \nrestock their farms too quickly in hope of additional payments. However, if payments are not \nsufficient, the system will have limited impact.  \n \n43.  Many countries lack systems to accurately register and map farms and conduct an \nadequate poultry census. Governance issues and the limited capacity of animal health services \nalso limit the capacity to set up a compensation system. The resources needed are likely to \nexceed  what  is  available  in  most  countries,  even  with  significant  international  support. \nSupplementary Appendix A discusses the issue of compensation in greater detail.  \n \nf.  Information Gap \n44.  Proper communication, including timely and accurate reporting of new outbreaks, is \nessential to control an epidemic. One key lesson from the SARS outbreak of 2003 was the \nimportance of managing information. The public and even health care providers lacked correct \ninformation. Information was not shared openly and transparently with the public or with the \ninternational community, which led many to overreact. \n \n45.  Risk communication requires special attention. The public needs clear, regular, and \nreliable information to understand governments' efforts to control outbreaks and to prevent \n ", "10  \npanic.  Civil  society,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other  community  groups  can  help \nfacilitate the flow of information and should be closely involved. The risk communication strategy \nshould aim appropriate messages at different groups, including farmers and poultry workers, \nhealth  workers,  animal  health  workers,  public  officers,  and  the  public.  Providing  accurate \ninformation, in appropriate language, is a public good and one that will likely require government \nintervention.  The  international  community  can  support  national  governments  with  accurate \ninformation and recommendations on how to craft a risk communication campaign.  \n \n2.  Strategic Context \n46.  Avian  influenza  directly  threatens  economic  growth,  a  key  determinant  of  poverty \nreduction. Economic analysis shows that in the short run, growth in East and South Asia would \nlikely be halted during a pandemic and many countries would go into recession. Beyond this, a \npandemic would shake the confidence of local and international investors, which could cause \nlong-term economic harm. A pandemic may reverse the accumulation of human capital, which \nwould hinder long-term poverty reduction. It would strain weak social protection and health \nsystems in most countries. \n \n47.  The avian influenza epidemic has important regional implications. Without cooperation, \nthe efforts of any individual country are likely to be ineffective. ADB is committed to promoting \nregional cooperation and developing regional public goods. ADB is well placed to support a \nregional response because of its presence in the region, access to regional networks, ability to \nprovide  and  mobilize  significant  financing,  and  experience  with  similar  issues.  Institutional \nstructures for surveillance and response and disaster management in the DMCs of the region \nneed to be strengthened. The region will continue to face a risk from avian influenza as well as \nother health threats with increasing frequency. \n \nC.  Rationale for a Regional Approach \n48.  ADB  will  help  member  countries  respond  to  the  challenge  of  avian  influenza  by \nsupporting regional activities. The rationale for a regional approach is as follows: \n \n1.  Disease Prevention and Control as Public Good \n49.  Investing in public health and disease prevention generates many positive externalities \nand has many characteristics of a public good. Disease prevention and control benefit the entire \npopulation and, for many interventions, it is not possible to restrict the benefits or to charge the \nbeneficiaries. The market, on its own, will not provide the optimal level of public health services, \nwhich is why public intervention is strongly justified. \n \n50.  Each  country  can  individually  take  action,  but  the  influenza  virus  can  easily  cross \nborders  even  with  a  sophisticated  national  response.  Countries  benefit  from  coordinating \nsurveillance and response activities to ensure that capacity is good throughout the region. If one \ncountry lacks capacity, it will undermine the efforts of other countries. Regionally, all countries \nbenefit from coordinating and establishing a set of common standards for activities such as \nculling diseased flocks, quarantining sick individuals, and informing the public (communication \nstrategy). This justifies a regional response, coordinated and financed through regional and \ninternational organizations, to help countries protect public health. \n \n ", "  11\n2.  Risk Pooling \n51.  The course of avian influenza is highly uncertain. Many experts expect a pandemic, but \ndo not know when, where, and how severe it will be. Over the last three centuries, there has \nbeen a pandemic about every 30 years. Each has been different in duration, severity, and \nvulnerable  population.  Preparing  for  a  pandemic  that  may  not  materialize  is  expensive, \nespecially for poor countries, and is likely to include stockpiling of antiviral drugs (for mortality \nreduction and for prophylaxis), personal protective equipment (masks, gloves, etc.), vaccines, \nand laboratory equipment and supplies.  \n \n52.  Working together regionally, countries can pool stockpiles and use them when and \nwhere they are needed most. As under an insurance scheme, instead of each country having a \nlarge stockpile, a regional stockpile can be placed in one or more central locations and be made \navailable as needed. This requires a clear set of criteria for accessing it. A quick decision-\nmaking structure is needed, as is a strong logistical system to ensure the safe storage and rapid \ndelivery of goods. International technical agencies, particularly WHO, are studying the most \nappropriate stockpiling mechanisms. \n  \n3.  Reduced Transaction Costs and Economies of Scale \n53.  Through  regional  actions,  countries  can  reduce  the  transaction  costs  of  many  key \nactivities. Health surveillance will be enhanced if the systems can feed into each other and \nprovide advanced warning. Regional training is more economical than national training as larger \ngroups can be covered. This is especially important for specific areas of knowledge where each \ncountry  might  need  only  a  few  specialists.  Training  of  trainers  can  be  enhanced  through \nexchanges to allow staff to see what works and what does not work in neighboring countries. \nCountries  can  pool  their  resources  to  enter  into  purchasing  agreements  with  drug  and \nequipment suppliers. By guaranteeing to purchase a certain amount of drugs and vaccines for \nexample,  prices  will  be  cheaper.  Large  orders  will  help  develop  production  capacity  as \nproducers are more confident about the returns on investment. These actions will reduce the \ntransaction cost for all participating countries and help ensure that middle- and low-income \ncountries have adequate access to supplies. \n \nD.  Lessons and Strategic Approach \n1.  Lessons  \n54.  ADB\u2019s experience in working with regional and international organizations has been \nlargely positive. These organizations have significant technical strength and generally have \ngood relations with the technical implementers at the national level, such as line ministries. In \nthe health sector, ADB has worked well with WHO globally and regionally. While international \norganizations have significant technical competence, they often need support in financing and \nimplementing  large  projects.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  partnership  with  technical  agencies  can  help \nbridge this gap. Both ADB and other international organizations have complicated rules for \nprocurement, contracting of consultant services, and project implementation. These are often \nnot compatible. From the outset, ADB should try to understand the fiduciary responsibilities of \nother agencies and identify ways of aligning them with its own.  \n \n55.  ADB  has  been  working  with  DMCs  to  develop  regional  response  to  public  health \nconcerns, such as HIV/AIDS and communicable disease control. This support has included a \nmix of support to national governments and to relevant international organizations. ADB has \n ", "12  \nfound that this mix provides a good balance and encourages DMCs to play an active role in \nregional dialogue.  \n \n56.  One of the most relevant lessons comes from ADB\u2019s work in supporting SARS control \nefforts in 2003. ADB supported WHO regionally and offered to support affected countries with \ntechnical assistance (TA) resources (grants) and restructured loans. ADB\u2019s support to WHO \nwas timely. Although WHO was the lead technical agency, it had limited resources, often tied to \nspecific  initiatives.  Besides  financial  support,  ADB  provided  WHO  with  important  logistical \nsupport and facilitated high-level access outside the health sector. This combination improved \nthe effectiveness of both organizations\u2019 activities to control the spread of SARS and is an \nimportant precedent for both organizations.   \n \n2.  Guiding Principles for Regional Support \n57.  ADB will be guided by the following principles:  \n \n58.  Effective Coordination. Several international agencies and development partners plan \nto support a response to avian influenza in the region. ADB will closely coordinate its support \nwith other partners to ensure synergies and avoid duplication. ADB will be guided by FAO/OIE \nand WHO to ensure technical consistency. ADB will work with others to ensure complete \nregional coverage. \n \n59.  Results Orientation. ADB\u2019s objective is to help countries control and prevent avian \ninfluenza. ADB will support only those regional activities that have demonstrable significant \nimpact on national efforts and will work to ensure that regional activities are properly linked to \nnational strategies and activities.  \n \n60.  Flexibility.  Interest  in  and  commitment  to  fighting  avian  influenza  is  growing.  The \ndisease and its risk to human and animal health are evolving. A rapid response to avian \ninfluenza has to be flexible in design and implementation. ADB will ensure that its operations \nare sufficiently flexible to meet the changing needs, including working closely with implementing \npartners to harmonize procedures.   \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n61.  The Project is part of the international effort to respond to the threat of highly pathogenic \navian  influenza  and  to  prepare  for  a  possible  human  influenza  pandemic,  thereby  helping \nprevent, or at least mitigate, possible major social and economic disruptions in Asia and the \nPacific region. The Project will improve national and regional capacity for surveillance and \nresponse to emerging diseases. The Project will be implemented in close coordination with \nother national and international initiatives. \n \n62.  The Project will support regional cooperation activities related to information sharing and \ncommunication, laboratory services, and public health procedures. The Project will support \nregional  capacity  to  respond  to  a  potential  pandemic.  The  Project,  designed  in  close \ncoordination  with  governments,  ASEAN,  FAO,  WHO,  and  other  regional  partners,  will  be \nimplemented in a harmonized way with other national and international initiatives. \n \n ", "  13\nB.  Outputs \n63.  The  Project  has  four  components,  to  be  implemented  over  2.5  years:  (i)  regional \ncapacity building, (ii) regional coordination, (iii) avian influenza response facility, and (iv) project \nmanagement. Appendix 5 shows the linkages between project components and the strategic \nactions to combat avian and human influenza.  \n \nC.  Grantees and Beneficiaries \n64.  The Project will benefit DMCs in Asia and the Pacific Region. It will provide grant support \nto international organizations to support regional capacity building activities and to strengthen \nthe avian influenza prevention and control activities of various DMCs. \n \n1.  Component 1: Regional Capacity Building  \n65.  The Project will strengthen the capacity of international organizations to support national \nactivities to control avian influenza, and to prevent, if possible, or prepare for, a human influenza \npandemic. Although the financing will be channeled through international organizations, support \nwill focus on activities that directly benefit DMCs and support their national efforts. \n \na.  Containing Infection at Source \n66.  The Project will help contain avian influenza at source by strengthening the capacity of \nFAO and ASEAN Secretariat to provide adequate support to DMCs\u2019 activities related to avian \ninfluenza and the animal health sector. The Project will finance consultants and the procurement \nof equipment, supplies, drugs, and services for animal health interventions. The Project will help \nstrengthen animal health services in the region and, among others, (i) develop and refine \nnational plans and capacities for containing avian influenza, (ii) develop policies and systems for \nanimal quarantine and vaccination, and (iii) develop guidelines for culling poultry flocks and \nestablishing compensation mechanisms. The financing will support FAO\u2019s regional emergency \nresponse team, the Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD). This \nsupport will focus on the ECTAD regional unit in Bangkok and elsewhere in the region. \n \nb.  Preventing Human Infection and Preparing for a Potential Human \nInfluenza Pandemic  \n67.  The Project will help prepare the region for a potential human influenza pandemic by \nstrengthening WHO\u2019s regional capacity to support countries. The Project will finance consultants \nand the procurement of equipment, supplies, drugs, and services to help prevent and control a \npandemic. Support will be oriented to countries\u2019 needs to protect human health and will, among \nothers,  include  activities  to  (i)  develop  and  rehearse  pandemic  preparedness  plans,  (ii) \nstrengthen surveillance and case management, and (iii) advise on drugs and medical supplies \nfor human influenza outbreaks.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Regional Coordination  \n68.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen  regional  coordination  and  communication  among \ncountries on emerging and communicable diseases among animals and humans. Regional \navian influenza communication and planning networks will be developed and expanded, and \nresearch  and  surveillance  networks  strengthened  to  coordinate  veterinary  and  biomedical \nanalysis  and  research.  The  Project  will  finance  national  advocacy  and  public  information \n ", "14  \ncampaigns. Appendix 6 contains details of regional activities. Funding in component 2 can be \nallocated  to  international  organizations  or  directly  to  participating  DMCs  when  they  have \nsufficient  capacity  (government  agencies,  academic  institutions,  or  the  private  sector)  to \nadminister the component themselves, without the support of international organizations.  \n \na.  Improved Technical Coordination \n69.  The  Project  will  help  improve  coordination  between  affected  countries.  It  will  help \nestablish  networks  to  share  epidemiological  and  other  scientific  information,  diagnostic \nproblems and solutions, and laboratory specimens and samples; develop regional research and \ndevelopment  projects  related  to  emerging  diseases;  and  strengthen  regional  reference \nlaboratories if requested, and coordinate responses to avian influenza and emerging diseases. \nSpecifically, this subcomponent will increase technical exchanges of staff and researchers, and \nregional efforts to develop and manufacture human and animal influenza vaccines and drugs.  \n \nb.  Rapid Field Response and Containment Capacity \n70.  The  Project  will  help  establish  a  cadre  of  national  and  international  professionals \nresident in the region, who can be rapidly mobilized to respond to a human influenza pandemic. \nSelected  from  different  countries  in  the  region,  they  will  be  trained  to  lead  a  pandemic \ncontainment response on short notice (Appendix 6). The Project will strengthen communication \nnetworks in the region to ensure early warning of emerging diseases. \n \nc.  Risk Communication \n71.  The Project will help DMCs develop and implement risk communication strategies on \navian influenza and emerging diseases, ensuring regional coordination and consistency in the \nmessages.  In  particular,  it  will  support  broad  civil  society  involvement  (mass  media, \nnongovernment organizations, and community workers) in public communication campaigns \nand mass education programs on avian influenza. Messages will help the public distinguish \nbetween avian influenza, seasonal influenza, and influenza pandemic. The Project will ensure \nthat information campaigns consider the language and culture of the target populations. This \neffort  will  support  and  complement  ongoing  activities  currently  being  jointly  developed  by \nUNICEF and WHO. \n \n3.  Component 3: Avian Influenza Response Facility  \n72.  The Project will expeditiously and flexibly help meet the changing needs of the evolving \nepidemic by creating an avian influenza response facility (AIREF). The Project will (i) provide \ncritical and urgent financing to contain an avian influenza outbreak, (ii) meet urgent needs for \nresponding to human influenza outbreaks in a pandemic or pre-pandemic scenario, and (iii) \nsupport regional stockpiling. Support for regional stockpiles will complement existing efforts by \npartners to establish stockpiles and will constitute only a small part of the overall contribution. \nCriteria for accessing AIREF financing, and operational details are in Appendix 7. \n \n73.  AIREF  financing  will  be  made  available  to  participating  DMCs  or  international \norganizations, as needed. DMCs will be able to access this funding through a simple application \nprocedure. While all DMCs are eligible to receive financing through this component, priority will \nbe given to those that are at greatest risk from avian influenza, following criteria established by \nADB and in consultation with WHO and FAO/OIE. A steering committee, headed by the Director \nGeneral of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), will guide AIREF \n ", "  15\nimplementation. Based on inputs from FAO, WHO, and other technical agencies, the steering \ncommittee will decide when to allocate resources. To ensure flexibility in resource allocation, \nADB may transfer the resources to its resident missions, country offices, or regional offices \nunder the country director\u2019s authority. Resources may also be transferred directly to an imprest \naccount established by DMCs, following procedures described in paragraph 102.  \n \n74.  AIREF may provide additional support to WHO, FAO, ASEAN, and other international \norganizations (if they enter into a grant agreement with ADB). International organizations may \nrequest urgent financing for activities related to avian influenza prevention and control, such as \ntraining  workshops,  enhancement  of  regional  response  teams,  and  emergency  support  for \ncountry offices.  \n \n4.  Project Management \n75.  The Project will be supervised by an avian influenza secretariat located within ADB, \nincluding equipment and supplies required for project management. The secretariat will include \na small number of consultants. Project resources will be used for workshops and meetings to \ncoordinate with participating DMCs and international organizations. The secretariat will support \nregional and national coordination with other partners, as well as project auditing and financial \nmanagement  services.  ASEAN,  WHO,  and  FAO  will  manage  their  own  operations  in \naccordance with their own procedures, subject to agreement with ADB. This will allow ADB to \nfocus on project coordination.  \n \nD.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant  \n76.  A $25 million Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant will support the activities proposed \nin the Project, through international organizations and eligible DMCs actively involved in avian \ninfluenza prevention and control. ADF IX includes a grant program to combat HIV/AIDS and \nother infectious diseases. Grants can also be made to a regional institution for reasons of \nefficiency  and  to  promote  public  goods.  As  international  organizations  involved  with  ADB \nmember countries and concerned with the economic development of Asia and the Pacific region, \nASEAN acting through the ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO satisfy the criteria for receiving \nADF funds for the ultimate benefit of ADF borrowing DMCs. The rationale and purpose of the \ngrants are outlined in Appendix 8. \n \nE.  Special Features  \n1.  Regional Cooperation \n77.  Most initiatives to control avian influenza are specific to countries. However, infectious \ndiseases cannot be stopped from spreading across borders without regional cooperation, and \nthere is a significant gap in funding to improve regional technical capacity and readiness. The \nProject adopts a regional approach because avian influenza control is a regional public good, \nand individual governments will need significant support from regional organizations to plan, \nmanage, and implement programs to respond to a pandemic. Regional collaboration will enable \neach  country  to  draw  on  the  expertise  and  experience  of  other  countries;  joint  planning \nexercises will support action to solve multi-country issues; and pooled resources will enable \neach country to respond more effectively to avian influenza outbreaks that are beyond their \nindividual capacity.  \n \n ", "16  \n2.  Flexible Implementation \n78.  The  Project  is  being  designed  in  coordination  with  other  national  and  international \ninitiatives  and  will  be  used  for  regional  activities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy.19 ADB will apply its guidelines and procedures flexibly to lower \nthe transaction costs of project implementation and significantly reduce the time for procurement \nand disbursement. Many of these features have been incorporated in the project design and in \nthe grant agreements, after consultation within ADB and with the implementing agencies.  \n \n3.  Preventive Action \n79.  The Project will directly contribute to the global effort to reduce the risks of an influenza \npandemic and, in the medium term, to control emerging diseases. Actions will be taken to \nreduce the prevalence of influenza among birds and to quickly address influenza outbreaks \namong  humans.  The  Project  will  support  international  efforts  to  contain  the  spread  of  an \noutbreak and mitigate its impact.  \n \n4.  Complementarity with International Efforts \n80.  ADB is helping interested countries control avian influenza by using savings under the \nongoing projects. This Project will work closely with these initiatives. In 2003, in response to the \nSARS outbreak, ADB financed a team of communicable disease specialists based in the WHO \nWestern Pacific Regional Office in Manila.20 The Project will build on these relationships. The \nProject will also complement two investment projects focusing on strengthening the human \nhealth surveillance system, the Preventive Health System Support Project in Viet Nam and the \nRegional Communicable Disease Control Project for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). \n \n81.  ADB will play an important role in improving regional coordination in Asia and the Pacific \nRegion. Currently, FAO, the World Bank, and WHO are leading global efforts to combat avian \ninfluenza. This role was recognized at the Beijing Conference, with the regional development \nbanks focusing on financing and coordination at the regional level. ADB will provide coordination \nfor many regional activities, serving as a link among the regional offices of FAO and WHO, \nDMCs, and other international organizations. ADB also brings important links to economic \nministries (such as the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, and the Central Bank) in many \ncountries. ADB has experience implementing projects and activities with Ministries of Agriculture \nand Health on a large scale in many DMCs which few other technical agencies have. ADB also \nhas extensive experience with regional cooperation initiatives, such as the GMS Program and \nother  similar  regional  and  sub-regional  initiatives.  ADB  will  build  upon  this  experience  in \ncoordinating project activities.  \n \nF.  Cost Estimates  \n82.  The Project is estimated to cost $38 million. Appendix 9 contains the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan for the Project. Supplementary Appendix B contains additional cost information, \nincluding classification of the budget by expenditure categories. \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2004.

All contingencies in the Project will be managed by ADB until they are allocated. They \nmay be allocated to international organizations and DMCs to support ongoing activities that \nneed additional help because of unforeseen changes in prices or implementation.  \n \nG.  Financing Plan  \n84.  ADB will provide a total of $38 million to support the Project as follows: (i) a grant of $25 \nmillion from ADF; (ii) a grant of $10 million from the Japan Special Fund (JSF), financed by the \nGovernment of Japan; and (iii) a grant of $3 million from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF) Table 2 outlines the financing plan.  \n \nTable 2: Grant Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total Cost  % \nADF   25.0  66 \nJSF   10.0  26 \nTASF   3.0  8 \nTotal  38.0  100 \nADF=Asian Development Fund, JSF=Japan Special Fund,  \nTASF=Technical Assistance Special Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n85.  ADB\u2019s Charter21 specifies that ADB may provide financing to international or regional \nagencies or entities concerned with economic development of Asia and Pacific. Access to ADF \nfunds for this purpose is permitted by Section 3.02 of the Regulations of the Asian Development \nFund. As the disease poses a risk to the entire region, which will benefit from the public good \naspects of the Project, DMCs not eligible for ADF resources must be included in the Project \nactivities. JSF and TASF funds will be used to finance eligible activities in all participating DMCs. \nADB\u2019s policy of not extending financing to countries in non-accrual status does not affect \n                                                 \n21 ADB.1966.

Reprinted with corrections June 2002).  \n ", "18  \nregional and subregional ADF IX grant financing provided for projects at regional level in which \nbenefits are indivisible. DMCs that are in non-accrual status will only receive support through \ninternational organizations under this Project and the Project will not directly finance DMCs in \nnon-accrual status. 22 \n \n86.  For several activities from components 1 and 2 of the Project, ADB will provide grant \nfinancing directly to ASEAN through ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO for the benefit of \nDMCs. Before conducting activities in a DMC, each participating international organization shall \nreceive confirmation from ADB as Executing Agency that the DMC does not object to ADB \nfinancing project activities in its territory. ADB will seek no-objection letters from all eligible \nDMCs.23 For some activities under component 2, financing can be provided directly to interested \nDMCs. For component 3, ADB will provide grant financing directly to eligible and participating \nDMCs or to participating international organizations, depending on their needs. All grants will \nhave terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those set out in the draft grant \nagreements presented to the Board.  \n \n87.  The Project will use funds from ADF, JSF, and TASF in conformity with applicable rules \nand regulations. For activities carried out by international organizations (through components 1, \n2, and 3), the Project will pool financing from all three sources. The proper use of ADF funds will \nbe ensured through the following: (i) each international organization receiving funds under the \nProject will be required to issue a certificate confirming that the ADF funds have been used for \nthe benefit of ADF- eligible borrowers only; and (ii) funds from ADF, TASF and JSF will be \ndisbursed based on the agreed percentages. These measures will ensure that ADF IX funds are \nonly used for the benefit of ADF-eligible borrowers. DMCs that receive financing directly from \nthe Project (through components 2 and 3) will receive funds only from one source in accordance \nwith standard practices and the nature of the support. The activities under components 1 and 2 \n(and some activities under component 3) of this Project are considered eligible for financing \nfrom TASF.  While TASF funds are typically used for technical assistance, the Regulations of \nthe TASF permit the use of TASF funds for financing the types of activities under components 1 \nand 2 (and some activities under component 3) of the Project.24  The Government of Japan has \nagreed that JSF resources can be used to finance activities under the Project. \n \n88.  International organizations have already contributed substantial resources to support \ntheir  own  efforts  to  combat  avian  influenza,  and  development  partners  are  contributing \nadditional resources that will, in many cases, complement ADB\u2019s support. ADB\u2019s support to \nparticipating DMCs will complement their own efforts to control avian influenza and implement \ninfluenza pandemic preparedness plans. Tables A9.1 and A9.2 (Appendix 9) provide additional \ninformation on the allocation of resources to eligible countries.  \n \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2004.

Implementation Arrangements  \n1.  Project Management \n89.  Executing Agency. Consistent with the Project\u2019s regional approach and the need for \nrapid implementation and fund disbursement, the Project will be administered by ADB directly, \nthrough a small avian influenza secretariat established in RSDD. The secretariat will ensure \noverall project supervision and provide strategic guidance to implementing agencies. It will also \nhandle the Project\u2019s administrative aspects and coordinate closely with ASEAN, FAO, and WHO. \nAppendix 10 outlines the Project\u2019s management structure. This arrangement will be reviewed \nperiodically and may be adjusted. \n \n90.  Implementing Agencies. ASEAN Secretariat25, FAO, and WHO will implement most of \nthe activities under components 1 and 2, in coordination with ADB. They will implement the \nproject  activities  in  accordance  with  their  organizational  focus  and  capabilities.  Each \ninternational organization will have its own project management structure.  \n  \n91.  Component 3 will be managed directly by ADB through the avian influenza secretariat, \nand financial resources will be transferred as needed, including to ASEAN, FAO, and WHO, \nparticipating DMCs, and other international organizations. Financial management and control \nprocedures  will  be  established  by  ADB.  The  ADB  country  and  regional  directors  may  be \nauthorized by the steering committee to directly procure equipment, services, and supplies. \nThey may also disburse emergency funds to governments for high-priority activities such as \nsurveillance in an area with an outbreak or support for quarantine enforcement. \n \n92.  Steering  Committee.  A  steering  committee  will  coordinate  project  activities.  The \nsteering committee will be headed by the director general, RSDD, and will have as members the \ndirectors general of ADB\u2019s five regional departments, the Strategy and Policy Department (SPD) \nand the Chair of the Health Sector Community of Practice. The steering committee will meet \nformally  every  3  months  to  guide  project  implementation,  policy  dialogue,  and  building  of \nregional capacity and cooperation. In case of an emergency, the steering committee may be \ncalled to meet on short notice to ensure quick ADB action. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n93.  The Project will be implemented over 30 months, from March 2006 to August 2008.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n94.  Procurement by international organizations, including ASEAN, FAO, and WHO, will be \ndone  according  to  each  agency\u2019s  procurement  policies,  acceptable  to  ADB.  To  ensure  a \nbalance  between  protecting  intellectual  property  rights,  equity,  quality,  and  economy, \nparticipating international organizations will use FAO and WHO guidelines, as appropriate, to \nprocure pharmaceutical and laboratory products. ADB will help pay standard and reasonable \nadministrative charges to implementing international organizations.  \n \n                                                 \n25 The grant agreement for the Project will be signed with ASEAN Secretariat, which is mandated to provide for \ngreater efficiency in the coordination of ASEAN organs and for more effective implementation of ASEAN projects and \nactivities. \n \n ", "20  \n95.  A participating DMC and ADB will identify a national implementing agency (or agencies) \nfor procurement, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the processes outlined in \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Subject to agreement by the DMC and ADB, \ninternational shopping procedures or local competitive bidding, with procedures acceptable to \nADB,  may  be  used  for  contracts  of  $200,000  or  more.  Direct  purchase  may  be  used  for \ncontracts worth less than $200,000. This allows more flexibility to meet the DMC\u2019s needs. The \nDMC  will  use  FAO  and  WHO  guidelines,  as  appropriate,  to  procure  pharmaceutical  and \nlaboratory products, subject to agreement by ADB.  \n \n96.  Given the importance of responding quickly to the region\u2019s changing needs, and of \nfacilitating work with potential cofinanciers and with international organizations with a diverse \nmembership, the procurement of goods and services will be permitted form both ADB member \nand non-member countries.26 \n \n4.  Consulting Services and Training Activities \n97.  Most  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  participating  international \norganizations  or  by  participating  DMCs.  ADB  will  engage  some  consultants  for  project \nadministration and may also contract, if requested, consultants directly for the use of DMCs and \ninternational  organizations.  The  Project  will  finance  an  estimated  651  person-months  of \nconsulting services through components 1, 2, and 4. Additional consultants may be recruited \nunder  component  3.  Appendix  11  summarizes  consulting  services  and  outline  terms  of \nreference.  \n \n98.  International organizations will use their own recruitment procedures, acceptable to ADB, \nto recruit consultants (firms and individuals). ADB financing will support short- and long-term \nconsultants in international organizations. ADB financing may only be used for staff directly \nsupporting the objectives and goals of this Project. As much as feasible and based on ADB's \nassessment  of  their  capacity,  implementing  agencies  in  DMCs  will  select  and  engage \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants or other procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Consistent with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, ADB will \nensure that selection and engagement of consultants is done flexibly and on time. If requested \nby international organizations or DMCs, ADB may recruit consultants directly to work with the \ninternational organization or DMC. \n \n99.  Given  the  importance  to  respond  quickly  to  changing  needs  of  the  region,  and  to \nfacilitate work with potential cofinanciers and with international organizations with a diverse \nmembership, the selection and engagement of consultants will be permitted from ADB member \nand nonmember countries.27 \n \n                                                 \n26 Pursuant to Chapter III, Article 14 (ix) of ADB\u2019s Charter, the Board of Directors, may by a vote of Directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of members, permit procurement of goods and \nservices from ADB non-member countries in appropriate circumstances. If the required affirmative vote of the \nBoard of Directors is not obtained, goods and services for the Project will be procured only from ADB member \ncountries. \n27 Pursuant to Chapter III, Article 14 (ix) of ADB\u2019s Charter, the Board of Directors, may by a vote of Directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of members, permit procurement of goods and \nservices from ADB non-member countries in appropriate circumstances. If the required affirmative vote of the \nBoard of Directors is not obtained, goods and services for the Project will be procured only from ADB member \ncountries. \n \n ", "  21\n100.  The  Project  will  support  training  and  capacity  building,  organized  by  international \norganizations or DMCs. They will prepare training plans in consultation with ADB and will \nensure that training is open to all qualified candidates. Appendix 12 provides an indicative list of \ntraining activities.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n101.  Quick  disbursement  is  the  key  to  effective  and  timely  response.  For  international \norganizations, ADB funds, which combine ADF, JSF, and TASF, will be drawn down on the \nbasis  of  up  to  12  months\u2019  estimated  expenditure,  subject  to  substantiation  of  previously \ndisbursed funds. ADB will specify the percentage for each fund that should be allocated to each \ninternational organization. At the time of each drawdown, the international organizations shall \nsubmit to ADB a written application indicating, among other things, a forecast of the use of such \nfunds.  The  amounts  to  be  drawn  down  shall  subsequently  be  replenished  against  (i)  the \nstatement of expenditures; and (ii) the submission of a financial report, as agreed in the grant \nagreement.  The  total  drawdown  shall  not  exceed  the  amount  agreed  by  the  international \norganizations and ADB.  \n \n102.  For expenditures executed by DMCs under components 2 and 3, ADB will provide \nadvances to the implementing agencies, as agreed by ADB, and each agency will establish \nimprest  accounts  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  upon  Project  effectiveness,  if \nrequired. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will be no more than 12 \nmonths\u2019 estimated expenditures. Replenishment of advances will be supported by a statement \nof  expenditures,  and  ADB  may  require  invoices  and  receipts,  as  indicated  in  the  grant \nagreement. Total disbursement will be up to the maximum amount agreed by the implementing \nagency  and  ADB.  Only  ADF-eligible  DMCs  may  receive  allocations  from  ADF  funds  in \ncomponent 3. Detailed arrangements for establishing and operating the imprest account will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook,28 as amended from time to time.  \n \n6.  Financial Management, Auditing, and Reporting \n103.  Financial Management. ADB has extensive experience administering TA projects and \nhas supervised numerous investment projects. ADB uses internationally recognized procedures \nfor accounting and auditing, has an internal audit function, and hires an independent external \nauditor annually. FAO and WHO operate under sound and internationally recognized accounting \nand financial principles. ADB has collaborated with both on TA projects and is implementing an \ninvestment project with WHO.  \n \n104.  Accounts  and  Auditing.  The  Project  will  apply  sound  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards according to internationally accepted practices. Funds managed directly by ADB will \nbe subject to same audit and reporting requirements as other resources managed by ADB.  \n \n105.  ASEAN acting through ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO will carry out audits on time, \nusing their own established procedures, acceptable to ADB, and submit to ADB certified copies \nof  audited  project  accounts,  financial  statements,  and  the  auditor\u2019s  reports.  Implementing \nagencies  in  participating  DMCs  will  also  provide  ADB  with  an  audited  report,  following \ninternationally accepted practices. They will submit to ADB certified copies of audited project \naccounts, including the imprest accounts, statements of expenditures, and financial statements, \nthe auditor\u2019s reports and opinions, and a management letter together with a report of actions \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2001.

Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy29 are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, contracts financed \ndirectly by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Cofinancing \n107.  ADB is in active dialogue with a number of potential co-financiers to mobilize additional \nsupport. Such cofinancing may include grants and loans and may benefit from ADB credit \nenhancements, including ADB guarantee instruments. ADB has typically sought Board approval \nto administer loan or grant funds from cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in \nplace. In light of the need for expediency and efficiency in ADB's response, Management \nrequests  Board  approval  of  the  administration  of  any  cofinanced  funds  obtained  from \ndevelopment  partners  after  Board  approval.  Approval  of  such  cofinanced  funds  will  be \nconfirmed and approved by Management, and reported to the Board in accordance with the \nstandard reporting procedures. This procedure will be adopted only if additional funds provided \nby  cofinanciers  will  not  materially  alter  or  fundamentally  affect  the  Project\u2019s  objectives, \npurposes,  and  scope.  Any  proposed  cofinancing  that  will  materially  affect  the  Project\u2019s \nobjectives, purpose, or scope will be processed as a major change of scope and circulated to \nthe Board in accordance with ADB procedures.  \n \n8.  Advance Action and Retroactive Finance \n108.  The  Project  will  support  advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  to \nrespond to the region\u2019s urgent needs. In particular, ADB will support preparation of bidding \ndocuments,  opening  of  tenders,  and  award  of  contracts,  as  required  by  international \norganizations; retroactive financing of contracts of goods and services; and advance consultant \nrecruitment and reasonable retroactive financing for international organizations in contracting \nconsultants for project-financed activities. Retroactive financing is expected to be minor. For \nASEAN, WHO and FAO, it may cover expenses 3 months before grant effectiveness and in no \ncase may exceed 10% of the total amount allocated to an international organization. ADB has \nexplained to participating international organizations that advance action does not commit ADB \nto finance the expenditure or the Project and that retroactive financing is only available after \napproval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n109.  ADB may also support advanced procurement and retroactive finance for participating \nDMCs. In this case, ADB will agree to support the procurement decision of the DMCs before the \nformal signing of the grant agreement. Retroactive financing may cover expenses 3 months \nbefore grant effectiveness and in no case may exceed 10% of the total amount allocated to a \nDMC. ADB will explain to the DMCs that advance action does not commit ADB to finance the \nexpenditure under the Project and that retroactive financing is available only after the signing of \nthe grant agreement.  \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2005. Anticorruption Policy. Manila.  \n ", "  23\n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n110.  ADB will carry out project performance monitoring and evaluation in accordance with the \nbaseline indicators and the monitoring targets that have been incorporated into the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). A document on lessons identified will be prepared upon \nproject completion. As the avian influenza threat is changing, indicators may also be modified. \nThe avian influenza secretariat will monitor the overall avian influenza situation and provide \nperiodic updates to ADB management.  \n \n10.  Reporting and Project Review \n111.  When  the  Project  becomes  effective,  the  avian  influenza  secretariat  will  prepare  a \nquarterly progress report summarizing (i) key activities that have been carried out and planned, \n(ii) outcomes and impact of project activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions \ntaken to resolve them, and (iv) coordination with other organizations and programs. Within 3 \nmonths of physical project completion, the secretariat will prepare a project completion report. \nOne year after effectiveness, ADB will review implementation and its impact. The Project may \nbe reoriented based on current conditions.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n112.  Regional Public Good. The Project will promote regional cooperation as a public good. \nThe Project will focus on strengthening the regional response to avian influenza, including \nstrengthening  links  among  countries,  sharing  information,  and  promoting  risk-pooling  and \nstockpiling of first-line goods. It will also help improve regional disease surveillance.  \n \n113.  Capacity Building. Although the Project is being developed to meet the immediate \nneeds of the region to fight avian influenza, this will also build up long-term regional capacity in \nanimal health and public health. Training supported by the Project will be valuable even if the \nH5N1 virus does not mutate into a human influenza virus. Zoonosis, the animal-to-human \ntransmission of disease, is a constant and increasing health concern, and surveillance and \nresponse capacity needs to be strengthened.  \n \n114.  Social  Benefits.  The  H5N1  epidemic  is  harming  small-scale  poultry  farmers  and \nthreatens the livelihoods of many poor and near-poor households. Reducing the spread of \nhighly  pathogenic  avian  influenza  among  poultry  and  helping  establish  sustainable \ncompensation schemes for culling diseased flocks will significantly improve the welfare of rural \nhouseholds.  \n \n115.  A human influenza pandemic would significantly increase poverty. Poor households \nwould be most at economic risk. Their access to the health system is limited and a catastrophic \nillness  would  send  them  deeper  into  poverty.  It  may  also  force  many  households  to  sell \nproductive assets to pay for health care. The poor are more likely to die from illness. Appendix \n13 contains the Project\u2019s summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \n116.  Economic Benefits. The Project will help prevent or delay an influenza pandemic and \nmitigate its impact. A pandemic would cost $100 billion\u2013$300 billion for the Asia and Pacific \nregion  (excluding  Japan).  The  Project,  in  coordination  with  global,  regional,  and  national \n ", "24  \ninitiatives, will lower the probability of a pandemic and minimize its economic impact. The \nProject is economically well justified. Appendix 14 contains the Project\u2019s economic analysis.  \n \nB.  Project Risks \n117.  Epidemiological Uncertainty. H5N1 is an avian virus rarely transmitted to humans. \nInfluenza  pandemics  are  the  result  of  avian  viruses  mutating  into  a  form  that  could  be \ntransmitted efficiently among humans. There is no guarantee that this will occur with the H5N1 \nvirus. Pandemics can vary widely in virulence and efficiency in spreading, and they may affect \ndifferent age groups differently. If the outbreak is mild, the Project may provide more support \nthan the region needs. However, if the outbreak is more severe than expected, the Project\u2019s \nsupport  may  not  be  sufficient.  ADB  is  prepared  to  offer  additional  resources  through \nuncommitted loan resources and is preparing stand-by arrangements. Building regional capacity \nfor disease surveillance and response will remain an important benefit of the Project with or \nwithout a pandemic. \n \n118.  Direct Administration. ADB will play a central role in administering the Project. The \nrationale  for  this  approach  is  clear\u2014reducing  the  number  of  steps  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement  and  avoiding  delays.  However,  it  also  carries  risks.  While  ADB  has  broad \nexperience  in  administering  TA  projects,  it  generally  supervises  investment  projects. \nDisbursement may be slow as both ADB and international organizations adapt to the features of \nthe Project. ADB will work closely with several strong international organizations and establish \nan avian influenza secretariat to oversee the Project. It will also use simplified procedures, in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  The  Project  was  also \ndesigned with significant internal consultation to ensure that ADB\u2019s administrative requirements \nwill not delay Project implementation.  \n \n119.  Donor Coordination. There is growing interest in supporting the fight against avian \ninfluenza. A large number of bilateral and multilateral agencies have offered assistance to \ntechnical agencies and governments, which also have their own initiatives. Duplication is a risk, \nand governments may not have the capacity to manage the offered assistance. One of the \nprimary  goals  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  regional  coordination,  including  developing  and \nimplementing preparedness plans and surveillance activities, to allow countries to take full \nadvantage of support.  \n \n120.  Low Demand. While avian influenza is a major concern of governments throughout the \nworld, they may shift priorities and lose interest if the H5N1 virus becomes less pathogenic or \ndisappears or if some other event takes center stage. ADB may commit significant resources \nthat may not be used for other priorities. Due to its flexible design, it would be easy to quickly \nadjust the Project. The Project is short, which also assures the quick return of project funds if \nthey are not fully used.  \n \nC.  Overall Assessment  \n121.  A pandemic would have substantial impact and could halt economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The Project will contribute to overall efforts against avian influenza. It will fill an \nimportant  niche  regionally  by  supporting  coordination  and  regional  activities.  Because  the \ncourse of avian influenza is so uncertain, the Project does have risks. However, the Project is \njustified based on its important contribution to the fight against avian influenza, and to regional \ncapacity building against emerging diseases. \n \n ", "  25\nV.  ASSURANCE \n122.  In addition to the standard assurances, ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO have each \ngiven the following assurance, which is incorporated into the legal documents: the Project is \nexpected to have no significant impact on environment, resettlement, indigenous people, or \nother vulnerable groups. If emerging needs require new Project activities during implementation \nthat may have an impact on environment, resettlement, indigenous people, or other vulnerable \ngroups, ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO will each inform ADB and will prepare and submit \nto ADB for approval plans, before requesting financing for that particular activity.  \n \nVI.

Seasonal Human Influenza \n1.  Influenza (the flu) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses. For \nmost patients, fever, headache, extreme tiredness, dry cough and sore throat, runny nose and \nmuscle aches will last 2 to 5 days and most will recover within one to two weeks. But in the very \nyoung, the elderly and people with chronic diseases, influenza poses a serious risk, at times \nleading  to  death.  Influenza  usually  requires  only  symptomatic  treatment.  Antibiotics,  which \ncannot  attack  the  virus,  are  used  only  to  treat  complications  (pneumonia,  bronchitis,  ear \ninfections) due to secondary infections caused by bacteria. Antiviral drugs now exist, which are \nuseful adjuncts in prophylaxis and treatment for more vulnerable people, and help reduce \ninfluenza-related hospitalization and mortality  \n \n2.  Epidemics of influenza typically occur every year, during the winter months in temperate \nregions and spread rapidly around the world in seasonal epidemics. The flu every year infects a \nsignificant portion of the population (ranging from 5% to 20%, depending on the strain), leading \nto the death of a small percentage (600,000 to 1.5 million people worldwide,1 but imposing a \nconsiderable economic burden. Studies, usually done in the context of the cost-effectiveness of \nvaccination in high income countries, have shown that regular flu outbreaks are quite costly in \nterms of lost productivity and additional medical care.2 Advances in public health and curative \nmedicine  and  the  developments  of  vaccines  have  greatly  reduced  the  impact  of  ordinary \n(seasonal) flu outbreaks. Antiviral medications have been developed and shown to be effective, \nwhen taken soon after the onset, in reducing the length of illness and in lessening its symptoms. \nThey are also generally effective as prophylaxis in healthy adults after exposure to a potential \ninfection. They also appear to be effective for high-risk populations and children.3 There are two \nclasses of antiviral drugs, the adamantane derivatives and the neuraminidases inhibitors. Some \nresistance to antiviral drugs has appeared but neuraminidases inhibitors \u2014zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) \nand oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) \u2014 remain effective when taken correctly and timely.  \n \n3.  Influenza A and B are the two types of influenza viruses that cause epidemic human \ndisease.4 The most dangerous outbreaks are \u201cType A\u201d caused by Influenza A viruses, which \ncan  also  infect  other  mammals  (pigs,  horses,  cats)  and  birds.  They  are  responsible  for \nepidemics and pandemics (all pandemics viruses are type A). Influenza B only affects humans \nand is responsible for sporadic outbreaks of illness. Influenza A viruses are further categorized \ninto subtypes on the basis of two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). \nThere are 16 different H antigens and 9 different N antigens that have been identified to date, \nused to name the viruses (such as \u201cH1N1\u201d, \u201cH3N2\u201d, \u201cH7N7\u201d, and \u201cH5N1\u201d). The influenza viruses \nare further separated into groups on the basis of other antigens, and these different groups \n(strains) may have different pathogenicity, even if they are classified in the same HN type. \n \n4.  The influenza viruses are very unstable, and when the virus replicate, there are frequent \nsmall mutations resulting in antigenic changes (i.e., antigenic drift) resulting in new influenza \nviruses.5 Immunity to the surface antigens (H and N) reduces the likelihood of infection and \nseverity of disease if infection occurs. But immunity against one influenza virus type or subtype \n                                                 \n1  In the United States, 200,000 people are hospitalized and 36,000 people die on average due to the flu every year.  \n2  Meltzer, M., Cox, N., and Fukuda, K. 1999.

The \nseasonal (annual) epidemics of influenza are due to minor changes in the virus, which allow it to \nescape the immunity that humans have developed after previous infections or vaccinations. \nLaboratory-based surveillance of the virus facilitates regular update of vaccines based on the \nmost recent strains of the virus. The annual vaccine contains the most likely strains of the virus \nwhich probably will attack the next year. The contents of the flu vaccine is determined every \nyear by WHO. But when a major change occurs in the virus (i.e., antigenic shift), no one will \nhave immunity against the infection because it is a completely new virus. If this new virus has \nalso the capacity to spread from person-to-person, a pandemic will occur.  \n \nB.  Avian Influenza  - A H5N1 \n5.  Avian  influenza  viruses  normally  infect  only  birds  (including  chicken,  ducks,  geese, \nquails,  and  wild  birds),  and,  occasionally,  pigs  and  other  mammals.  Wild  birds,  especially \nwaterfowls, are a natural reservoir of the viruses and some species may be healthy carriers of \ninfluenza viruses. Domestic poultry (especially chicken) are vulnerable to infection that can \nrapidly reach epidemic proportions. The disease in birds has two forms, a mild illness barely \nnoticed and a \u201chighly pathogenic avian influenza\u201d (HPAI), which is extremely contagious and \nrapidly fatal for the birds. Mutations or reassortment of the bird flu virus into new and more \naggressive strains occur regularly and have already caused several severe avian flu outbreaks \nin the past, some of them causing human fatalities. In 1997 in Hong Kong, China, 18 people \nwere infected and 6 died, and in the Netherlands in 2003 several people were infected and one \ndied. In both cases as well as in other similar outbreaks, spread of the virus was stopped by \nimmediately culling the whole population of infected chickens.  \n \n6.  The present avian influenza outbreaks caused by the H5N1 strain, which first appeared \nin Hong Kong, China in 1997, started in December 2003. H5N1 has spread widely in East Asia \nand has now reached Africa, Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. In Asia, particularly in the \nMekong region, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and in Indonesia, H5N1 is now endemic \nand firmly established. Since 2003, up to 150 million birds have died or been culled. As of 1 \nMarch  2006,  WHO  confirmed  174  cases  and  94  fatalities.6 To  date,  most  known  human \ninfections have been in Asia, largely among farm workers. While the microeconomic impact of \nthe avian flu epidemic can be severe among farmers with little access to safety nets because of \nthe losses from chicken deaths and culling, the economic impact at the macroeconomic level is \nexpected to be minor.7 However, this will be true only if avian flu remains confined to animals. \nBut  another  scenario  is  possible,  when  H5N1  virus  acquires  the  capacity  to  easily  be \ntransmissible, passing directly from human to human, and becomes responsible for a pandemic. \n  \n7.  Patients typically suffer high fever and multiple symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, and bleeding in gums and teeth. Unlike in a typical influenza outbreak, most \npatients contract viral pneumonia, which is not responsive to antibiotic treatments. Current \nprotocols recommend prompt treatment with antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors for both adults \nand children. However, antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors appear to be only partially effective in \nfighting the infection. They do not cure the patient but they may increase the survival rate and \nlower the possibility of transmission. In addition, osltamivir is recommended as post-exposure \nprophylaxis. \n \n                                                 \n6  Taken from the World Health Organization\u2019s Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response webpage, available at \nhttp://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/pandemic/en/index.html, accessed on 23 February 2006.  \n7  Asian Development Bank.

Compared with the great number of birds infected and the wide geographical area \ninvolved, the number of human infections by H5N1 remains insignificant, reflecting the very poor \n\u201cefficiency\u201d of the virus to affect humans. Only people (mainly poor farmers) in contact with sick \nor dead chickens in their backyard seem to have been infected, with only very limited possible \ntransmission of the virus between humans. \n \nC.  Human Influenza Pandemic \n9.  Human influenza pandemic is a worldwide outbreak of human influenza. A pandemic \ncan start when three conditions have been met: a new influenza virus subtype emerges; it \ninfects humans, causing illness; and it spreads easily among humans. The virus can improve its \ntransmissibility among humans via two principal mechanisms. The first is reassortment, in which \ngenetic material is exchanged during co-infection of a human or pig. Reassortment between \nhuman and avian viruses could result in a fully transmissible pandemic virus, announced by a \nsudden surge of cases with explosive spread. The second mechanism is a more gradual \nprocess of adaptive mutations, whereby the capability of the virus to bind to human cells \nincreases during subsequent infections of humans. Adaptive mutation, expressed initially as \nsmall clusters of human cases with some evidence of human-to-human transmission, would \nprobably give the world some time to take defensive action.88 \n \n10.  The most severe influenza pandemic occurred in 1918\u20131919, responsible for 40\u201350 \nmillion deaths worldwide. This pandemic, commonly known as the Spanish Flu, was caused by \nthe influenza A/H1N1 virus, recently shown to be an avian influenza virus that jumped the \nspecies barrier directly to humans.99 The other two influenza pandemics of the 20th century, in \n1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) were both due to avian influenza viruses that recombined with \nhuman strains. While it is not clear where the 1918 strain originated, the 1957 and 1968 strains \nboth originated in Asia. The severity of the Spanish Flu was due, in part, to the circumstances \n(first World War 1914\u20131918), including extremely poor sanitary conditions in the trenches and \npoor nutrition. It spread quickly with the demobilization of soldiers at the end of the war.1010 \nToday, vaccines, antibiotics and antiviral drugs will be available. Still, WHO and the CDC \nestimate that a pandemic is likely to result in 2 million to 8 million deaths globally, with a very \nhigh economic cost, particularly for low income countries where health care resources are \nalready constrained. If an influenza pandemic starts, WHO warns: \n \n(i)  Given the large movements of goods, services, and people, the virus may spread \nrapidly, leaving little or no time to prepare. \n(ii)  Antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and pandemic vaccines when developed, will be in \nshort supply and unequally distributed. It will take several months before any \nvaccine becomes available. \n(iii)  Medical facilities will probably be rapidly overwhelmed. Moreover, widespread \nillness  may  result  in  shortage  of  personnel  to  provide  essential  community \nservices. \n                                                 \n8  http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/avian_faqs/en/. \n9  Taubenberger, J., Reid, A., Lourens, R., Wang, R., Jin, G., and Fanning, T. 2005.

To monitor the epidemiological changes related to the influenza viruses and prepare for \na possible human influenza pandemic, WHO has developed a classification of the risk of a \nhuman influenza pandemic into stages.111This is summarized in Table A2.1. As of February \n2006, the global level of alertness is at stage 3.  \n \nTable A2.1: Influenza Pandemic Stages \n \nInterpandemic Period \nPhase 1  No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. An influenza virus \nsubtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals. If present in \nanimals, the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low. \nPhase 2  No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. However, a \ncirculating animal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease. \nPandemic Alert Period \nPhase 3  Human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no human-to-human spread, or at most \nrare instances of spread to a close contact. \nPhase 4  Small cluster(s) with limited human-to-human transmission but spread is highly \nlocalized, suggesting that the virus is not well adapted to humans. \nPhase 5  Substantial Pandemic Risk: Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human spread still \nlocalized, suggesting that the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to \nhumans, but may not yet be fully transmissible. \nPandemic Period \nPhase 6  Pandemic: increased and sustained transmission in general population. \nSource: Adapted from World Health Organization. 2005.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 World  Health  Organization.  2005.

Controlling  the  spread  of  the  avian  influenza  and  other  emerging  communicable \ndiseases is a regional public good. Countries benefit from the preventive actions taken in \nneighbor countries and likewise suffer when neighboring countries ignore the risk of avian \ninfluenza. All countries benefit from public health actions carried out by agencies at the regional \nlevel. No country, on its own, will be able to control avian influenza completely.  \n \n2.  The cost of fighting avian influenza can be divided into several levels. First, there are \nneeds at the country level, for the efforts of national and local governments, and at the regional \nand  global  levels,  to  support  multi-country  initiatives.  Financing  multi-country  initiatives  is \nimportant because of the economies of scale in joint work and the need for multi-country \ncoordination. Second, while efforts to fight avian influenza must multisectoral, they can be \nbroadly divided into efforts into (i) efforts to control avian influenza in the bird population, (ii) \nefforts to prevent the disease from mutating into a human-transmissible influenza, and (iii) \nefforts to mitigate and recover from an influenza pandemic. Finally there is a time element. \nAvian influenza poses an immediate challenge to the region and requires immediate action, \nusually in the next 2 years. The current outbreak of avian influenza has also highlighted the \nimportance of increased investment to improve animal and human health.  \n \n3.  Assessing the region\u2019s needs for avian influenza prevention and control are complicated \nby the great uncertainty about the future course of the disease and the risk that it presents to \nhuman health. With guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and \nAgriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank has made an initial needs estimate at the \ncountry level.1 ADB has worked closely with FAO and WHO in understanding their regional \nneeds for avian influenza control.  \n \nB.  Country Needs \n4.  Country needs can be divided into several major components. First, coordination and \ncommunication are essential, as the lack of information can substantially increase the economic \nimpact of any disease outbreak as local authorities and the public tend to overreact. Second, \nsurveillance and early warning systems have to be strengthened both for animal health and for \nhuman health. Third, countries need to strengthen their response capacity to avian influenza \noutbreaks. Finally, there is a need to strengthen national health systems, both in their capacity \nto respond to local outbreaks and in surge capacity to address generalized epidemics. Animal \nand human health systems will have to finance a wide range of items, ranging from laboratory \nequipment to protective clothing to overtime payments for staff.  \n \n5.  The World Bank\u2019s initial estimates for East Asia, Southeast Asia (including the Mekong \nRegion), the Pacific, and South Asia show that the developing countries require $711 million for \nthe next 2 to 3 years for their avian influenza prevention and control programs. The World Bank \nestimates that these countries collectively can finance, without external support, between $240 \nmillion to $380 million. Central Asian and Caucasus countries probably need an additional $45 \nmillion, with financing capacity in the range of $10 million to $15 million.  \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2005. Avian and Human Influenza: Financing Needs and Gaps. Accessed on 12 January 2006 on \nwww.worldbank.org/avianflu. \n ", "  Appendix 3  35 \n6.   These probably underestimate the total need in the region. The estimates tend to focus \nheavily on needs for animal health and underestimate the potential needs in several major \npoultry producing countries. Although the needs of the health system are factored, there is \nreason to expect that they are several times higher than what is contained in the World Bank \nestimates. For example, initial ADB estimates, based on influenza models developed by the \nCenters for Disease Prevention and Control in the United States suggest total health care costs, \nshow health care costs in the range of $10 billion during an influenza pandemic. While most of \nthis cost would be borne by households, it suggests significant costs to the governments in \naffected regions.  \n \nC.  Regional Needs \n7.  Even  with  additional  finances,  the  capacity  of  many  countries  to  implement  avian \ninfluenza  control  activity  is  limited.  Although  most  countries  are  developing  pandemic \npreparedness plans, the quality of these plans varies greatly. To ensure that the additional \nresources  are  used  efficiently,  governments  will  need  support  from  technical  agencies  to \nsupport their capacity.  \n \n8.  FAO and WHO are the two main technical agencies in avian influenza prevention and \ncontrol  activities.  They  serve  both  as  coordinating  agencies,  working  with  governments  to \nensure that information is shared and responses are consistent, and as technical resource \ncenters, providing technical support to implementation.  \n \n9.  Although international agencies tend to have large budgets, these budgets are largely \ntied to pre-existing programs and there is little room for reallocating resources among programs. \nLikewise, much of the staff is assigned to programs. Both FAO and WHO have allocated \nsignificant amounts of their discretionary and emergency response budgets to focus on avian \ninfluenza and they have made estimates of their additional resource needs at the regional level.  \n \n10.  Much  of  the  support  provided  to  international  organizations  will  benefit  countries, \nparticularly poorer countries. Support at the regional level makes sense due to the significant \neconomies of scale that are generated for large scale procurement and training. In addition, \ninternational organizations can target countries that most need support, which gives additional \nflexibility in the face of uncertainty.  \n \n11.  There are a number of key needs that can be best organized at the regional level. \nEstablishing regional stockpiles of drugs and medical equipment and supplies allows the region \nto  prepare  strategically  for  a  human  influenza  outbreak.  By  preparing  a  stockpile,  health \nauthorities can respond quickly to a new influenza cluster and take actions to prevent further \noutbreak. Since initial outbreaks are likely to be limited geographically, assembling stockpiles at \nthe regional level introduces important economies of scale.  \n \n12.  The  exchange  of  information  is  a  critical  element  in  strengthening  pandemic \npreparedness. Organization of regional training increases the access of animal and human \nhealth workers to specialist training that can be offered economically in their own country. \nRegional networking (through workshops, communication systems, and the like) also plays an \nimportant role in enhancing the exchange of information.  \n \n13.  Food and Agricultural Organization. FAO, in cooperation with the World Organization \nfor Animal Health (OIE), focuses on controlling avian influenza. They provide technical support \nto governments, in the form of training, support for laboratories, and the provision of technical \n ", "36  Appendix 3 \nspecialist.  FAO  also  can  provide  emergency  response  funds  to  help  countries  with  avian \ninfluenza outbreaks. FAO has made estimates of its needs at the global level, referring to \nresources used at its headquarters that are not assigned to any particular region, and regional \nlevel resources, for activities and networks done at the regional level and the needs of FAO\u2019s \nregional offices.2 Central to FAO\u2019s needs is the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal \nDisease (ECTAD), which serves a multidisciplinary response unit. ECTADs will be established \nat both the global and regional levels. FAO will provide support to regional laboratories that will \nprovide support to country level laboratories.  \n \n14.  Based on the needs for 2 years, and following the FAO estimates, regional needs are at \nleast $18.6 million, factoring in only support provided at the regional level (largely implemented \nby FAO\u2019s Bangkok office). FAO also proposes to strengthen regional reference laboratories for \ntesting for avian influenza, with an expected cost of $29 million. Part of this cost is focused on \nAsia and the Pacific region.  \n \n15.  The World Health Organization. Globally, WHO is divided into six regions that have \nsignificant autonomy. The Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO), with its headquarter in \nManila, and South East Asia Regional Office (SEARO), based in Delhi, cover most of the Asia \nand Pacific Regional Office. Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Central Asian countries are in the \nEastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) and in the European Regional Office (EURO). \nMost resources are allocated through regional offices, with WHO headquarter focusing on \nmaintaining consistency and regional coordination.  \n \n16.  Support for regional activities in WPRO and SEARO require approximately $26.0 million. \nThis  includes  regional  cooperation  activities,  such  as  regional  response  teams  and  rapid \ninterventions, risk communication and information sharing, and establishing regional stockpiles. \nSupport for EMRO and EURO that is likely to benefit countries in Asia and the Pacific region is \napproximately $11.0 million, for similar activities. One important component of WHO\u2019s support is \nthe Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GORAN), which aims to improve the sharing \nof information and enhance transparency.  \n \n17.  Other Organizations. A number of other organizations and networks are active at the \nregional level. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is proposing to increase \nsubregional coordination in both the areas of animal and human health and to improve the \norganization\u2019s own capacity to respond outbreaks in the future. The Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation  is  sponsoring  a  number  of  events  to  raise  business,  government,  and  public \nawareness on avian influenza.  \n \n                                                 \n2 FAO. 2005.

Avian influenza is a major challenge that could impact the health and economic progress \nof the whole world. Since the disease spreads quickly across international borders, there has \nbeen a great deal of international attention focusing on controlling its spread and reducing the \nrisk of human influenza pandemic. The international community has been mobilized and is \ncommitting significant resources to prevent and control avian influenza. Since the situation is \nrapidly evolving and there is a growing realization that a risk of a pandemic is real, the global \nresponse is also changing.  \n \n2.  The international community has organized a series of international meetings to discuss \nthe threat posed by avian influenza to animal health and the potential of human influenza \npandemic. These meeting have discussed strategy, response, and financing needs. A general \nconsensus has been met about the future direction of action. These meetings have also served \nto develop a sense of urgency and a high level of commitment for combating the challenge of \navian influenza and preventing a human pandemic. \n \n3.  There is wide agreement that the best strategy would be to minimize the threat at source \nthrough prevention of the spread of the avian influenza virus. This would entail timely notification \nof avian influenza outbreaks in domestic and wild birds and rapid containment through poultry \nculling and vaccination as indicated. Early warning and surveillance systems for animal and \nhuman influenza are critical to an effective response, and include provision of appropriate \ncompensation to livestock farmers, especially for backyard poultry farming. The window of \nopportunity to prevent a pandemic is short. The experience of SARS1 shows that transparent \nand immediate reporting is essential, as is the open sharing of virus samples to facilitate rapid \nidentification of the virus subtype and, when needed, preparation of an effective human vaccine. \n \n4.  It has generally been acknowledged that at present many governments are not ready to \ncope with avian influenza outbreaks, much less a human pandemic. Increasing preparedness is \nvital in every country and in every region. As the disease can easily cross borders, it has been \nrecognized that there is a need for all countries and regions to develop comprehensive plans \nthat  integrate  interventions  related  to  animal  and  human  health.  These  plans  should  also \nconsider  possible  disruptions  to  essential  services  in  case  of  a  pandemic  and  strengthen \nexisting surveillance systems and response mechanisms. The international community has \nproposed that these plans can become the basis for coordinated financial and technical support \nfrom bilateral donors and international agencies, with current plans for a major meeting focusing \non financing needs in January 2006.  \n \n5.  Because  of  the  evolving  nature  of  support,  it  is  difficult  to  accurately  measure  the \ncontribution of each financier. Contributions have been made to international organizations, \nprimarily the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization \n(WHO), directly to governments in affected countries, and through existing and bilateral disease \ncontrol programs. Significant resources have been pledged, subject to the design of the project. \nMany of the resources have been committed in kind, including expert visits, training fellowships, \nand the donation of equipment and supplies. It appears that Asia and the Pacific region have \n                                                 \n1 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. \n ", "38  Appendix 4 \nreceived most of the contributions. Below is a summary of some of the major contributions and \npledges to date, based estimates from the FAO2 and ADB staff review.  \n \n6.  Asian  Development  Bank.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided \nemergency assistance to the governments of Cambodia, Lao\u2019s People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR), and Viet Nam through a regional technical assistance program of around $200,000. \nIt is also supporting a communicable disease response team based at WHO that has been \ninstrumental in supporting surveillance and response of affected countries. ADB has committed \n$68 million in new health projects that can be \u201cretrofitted\u201d to support avian influenza control \nactivities, at least $75 million in additional resources from project savings and reallocations, and \nan additional $300 million in new loans, if requested by affected countries.  \n \n7.  A  grant  for  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Project  for  the  countries  of \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam was approved on 21 November 2005 for $30 million. The \nProject will strengthen the regional capacity to control emerging and endemic communicable \ndiseases  within  the  framework  for  regional  collaboration.  It  will  (i)  strengthen  national \nsurveillance and response systems, (ii) develop models of communicable diseases surveillance \nand control in different provinces based on local priorities, and (ii) improve regional collaboration \nin  communicable  diseases  control  (CDC)  and  health  system  development.  The  targeted \nprovinces are important for CDC in terms of regional connectivity, high burden of infectious \ndiseases, and the level of vulnerable populations. \n \n8.  Australia. The Government of Australia has been one of the largest contributors to \navian influenza prevention and control activities. As of October 2005, it has allocated around \n$19.2 million, largely through regional organizations and international technical organizations \nsuch as WHO and FAO. Support has included equipment, experts, and supplies. It has also \nintensified training of national experts to strengthen the technical capacity of affected countries. \nThis includes support at the regional level and at the country level. Indonesia has been the \nlargest single recipient of support. In January 2006, it committed around $75 million.  \n \n9.  Germany. The Government of Germany has provided around $7 million (as of May \n2005), largely to support the implementation of the global strategy. Germany has also provided \nsupport at the country level, largely through trusts funds at FAO. Germany plans to allocate \naround  $28  million  to  support  scientific  research  and  pandemic  preparedness,  largely  in \nSoutheast Asia.  \n \n10.  Japan. Japan has been very active in providing regional and national support, working \nwith governments and international organizations such as ADB and the World Bank. It has \ncommitted  $10  million  to  ADB  for  its  regional  project  and  more  than  $4  million  to  other \norganizations, through existing trust funds. This aid has largely focused on Viet Nam and \nregional activities. Japan has also provided significant support in kind. In January 2006 it \ncommitted around $135 million, including a contribution to the World Bank\u2019s multi-donor trust \nfund.  \n \n11.  United  States. Working mainly at the regional level, the Government of the United \nStates  has  provided  substantial  support  to  international  organizations  and  directly  through \nsupport from the Centers for Disease Control and the United States Agency for International \n                                                 \n2  FAO/OIE/WHO  \u201cGlobal  Strategy  for  the  Progressive  Control  of  Highly  Pathogenic  Avian  Influenza  (HPAI)\u201d \nAvailable at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/documents/ai/HPAIGlobalStrategy31Oct05.pdf, accessed on 24 \nNovember 2005. \n ", "  Appendix 4  39 \nDevelopment.  This  includes  support  to  strengthen  community,  national,  and  regional \nsurveillance systems and the provision of protective gear. The United States has, to date, \ncommitted around $13 million.  \n \n12.  Canada.  Directly  affected  during  the  SARS  epidemic  in  2003,  the  Government  of \nCanada rapidly reacted to reduce the threat of emerging infectious diseases in Southeast Asia \nand China. Through the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government has prepared the \nCanada-Asia Regional Emerging Infectious Diseases (CAREID) project. The project, financed \nby a CD 15.0 million grant, aims at strengthening regional and national capacity in emerging \ninfectious  disease  surveillance  and  response  and  in  epidemic  preparedness,  in  close \ncollaboration with WHO. Both CAREID and the ADB project have adopted a regional approach \nto strengthen capacity. Both projects are complementary, with the ADB project also addressing \nemergency and unexpected needs.  \n \n13.  The  World  Bank. The World Bank has been active in providing support for avian \ninfluenza since 2004. This support includes substantial assistance to Viet Nam (including a \ngrant from Japan) of around $6 million and the organization of regional level activities and \nconferences. The World Bank has prepared an avian influenza finance facility, which was \napproved in January 2006 for $500 million that will serve as the main source of funds for \ninterested countries. Several countries have expressed interest in utilizing the resources from \nthis facility and the World Bank is preparing several country-specific projects. The World Bank \nhas also established a multi-donor grant trust fund to provide grant assistance. The grant trust \nfund has received contribution from the European Commission, the Government of Japan, and \nseveral other development partners.  \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \nLINKAGES BETWEEN STRATEGIC ACTIONS  \nFOR AVIAN INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC AND PROJECT COMPONENTS \n \nStrategic Actions for Controlling Avian  Project Activities  Project Component \nand Human Influenza \n \nContaining infection at source (animal health) \n1.

The Project aims to minimize the social and economic disruption caused by avian and \nhuman  influenza  outbreaks  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  prevalence  of  avian  and  human \ninfluenza will be reduced by (i) strengthening national capacities for containing and preventing \navian and human influenza outbreaks; (ii) enhancing regional cooperation and communication \nthrough support to regional networks, information exchange, and risk communication strategy; \nand  (iii)  supporting  regional  stockpiles  of  drugs  and  equipment.  Regional  activities  will  be \nimplemented by regional partners that have a network of technical expertise in place, namely \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), \nand World Health Organization (WHO). This appendix outlines details of activities in Component \n2: Regional Cooperation. The indicative activities in this appendix are taken from WHO and \nFAO proposals1 submitted to ADB at the time of project preparation. \n \nA.  Subcomponent 2.1: Improved Technical Coordination \n \n2.  While  individual  countries  prepare  or  update  their  human  influenza  pandemic \npreparedness plans, additional efforts are required to strengthen activities to address regional \nissues (e.g., management of borders, establishment of regional networks, etc.). Support to \nregional networks help to (i) control or prevent the virus or disease in already infected regions in \nAsia, and prepare regions at new risk of the virus or disease as it spreads beyond the region. \nRegional networks help support coordination of early warning, and disease surveillance and \ndisease diagnosis at subregional levels. The Project will support WHO and FAO in developing \nand strengthening regional activities under this subcomponent. Subcomponent 2.1 seeks to \nimprove coordination between affected countries and technical agencies for regular exchange of \nepidemiological information, laboratory specimen, and supplies.  \n \na.  Strengthening Laboratory Networks \n \n3.  Regional Laboratory Networking (WHO). The purpose of this activity is to strengthen \nlaboratory capacity by developing and maintaining a regional laboratory network to support \ndiagnosis and antiviral resistance monitoring. The Project will support WHO activities that lead \nto improved capacity building at the regional level. A list of indicative activities includes:  \n \n(i)  Development of standard operating procedures (SOPs). A regional meeting to \nagree  on  guidelines  and  SOPs  concerning  specimen  collection,  storage, \ntransport, testing, and reporting of results. Participants include national laboratory \nheads,  international  influenza  reference  laboratories,  representatives  from \ninternational airlines and courier services.  \n(ii)  Costs to cover the international shipment of specimens, such as courier services, \npurchase of appropriate packing materials and containers. \n(iii)  Development of training material and training courses for national laboratory \nprofessionals. Training courses to ensure uniformity in testing techniques and \nfacilitating the establishment of a network of laboratory personnel.

Regional Networks of National Diagnostic Laboratories and Epidemio-Surveillance \nTeams (FAO). The purpose of this activity is to support regional networks of national diagnostic \nlaboratories and epidemio-surveillance teams for the control and prevention of avian influenza. \nThe presence of H5N1 virus in Southeast Asia continues to threaten the poultry industry and \npublic health of humans. It puts at risk other regions that come in contact with infected birds \nthrough trade or migratory flyways. Coordination is needed at many level, including field and \ncentral/national  level,  among  veterinary  diagnostic  laboratories  and  epidemiology  teams. \nRegional networks provide technical support to national staff to help improve the quality of \nsurveillance and diagnosis. One national laboratory and one epidemio-surveillance team will be \nchosen to lead the regional group. According to FAO, this approach has proven to be successful \nin other circumstances, such as the rinderpest eradication campaigns in Asia and Africa.  \n \n5.  The Project will help support FAO activities aimed at \n \n(i)  promoting and coordinating harmonized regional approaches for early detection \nand reporting through regional coordination centers;  \n(ii)  developing and implementing a proficiency testing system for national veterinary \nlaboratories  with  the  support  of  the  OIE-FAO  International  Reference \nLaboratories and Collaborating Centers for Avian Influenza (OFFLU);  \n(iii)  establishing  sustainable  networks,  bringing  together  veterinary  officials  and \nexperts  from  the  national  diagnostic  laboratories  and  epidemio-surveillance \nteams and build their capacity to support the above;  \n(iv)  developing data analysis and disease intelligence capacity in order to better \nunderstand the epidemiology of the disease and prepare risk maps to allow \nimplementation of targeted surveillance and control programs; and  \n(v)  applying improved epidemiological capacity to revise strategies and improve the \neffectiveness of disease control activities.  \n \n6.  Specific  activities  include  development  of  linkages  with  regional  organizations  and \nnational  and  international  animal  health  organizations,  conducting  strategic  and  technical \nmeetings,  providing  training  tools  and  training,  procuring  equipment,  information  and  data \ncollection and management, enhancing exchange of information and sharing of lessons learned \nin influenza control, supporting the planning for national avian influenza control and emergency \npreparedness, and support for the implementation of avian influenza control programs \n \n7.  Specific  activities  might  include  workshops,  institutional  capacity  building,  training, \nstudies,  information  sharing  with  international  agencies,  and  recommendations  to  regional \norganizations  and  survey  design  institutes.  The  Regional  Support  Unit  for  East  Asia  will \ncoordinate activities and ensure that an appropriate level of technical assistance is provided. \nIndicative areas for study include trade impacts of outbreaks in the region, structure of poultry \nmarkets, livelihoods, poverty and gender impacts of control measures adopted, direct costs of \ncontrol measures adopted, assumptions underlying control strategies including perceptions of \nrisk and veterinary services capacity, and/or potential benefits over time from control measures. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  43 \nB.  Subcomponent 2.2: Regional Field Response and Containment Capacity \n \n8.  Subcomponent 2.2 seeks to (i) strengthen rapid field response and containment capacity \nat the regional level, and (ii) support pandemic influenza preparedness through information and \ncommunication technology (ICT).  \n \n9.  Rapid  Response  and  Containment  (WHO).  The  importance  of  rapid  response \ncapabilities for infectious diseases and other emergencies is highlighted by the recent emerging \ninfectious  diseases  and  preparations  for  future  infectious  diseases.  Pooling  of  experience, \nexpertise and resources is essential for cost-effectiveness given the great deal of uncertainty \nabout the future course of avian influenza at present. Global tools, such as the Global Outbreak \nAlert and Response Network (GOARN) and the International Health Regulations (IHR), have \nbeen developed to facilitate more effective international responses. While some recent outbreak \nresponses for avian influenza have proceeded well, others have been relatively disjointed.  \n \n10.  The Project will support WHO activities aimed at  \n \n(i)  strengthening regional and national capacities for surveillance, rapid containment \nof avian influenza breakouts, human influenza surveillance, case identification \nand management through training; and  \n(ii)  improving  coordination  between  countries  and  technical  agencies  for  regular \nexchange of epidemiological information, laboratory specimens, and supplies.  \n \n11.  Specific activities might include the following: \n \n(i)  Strengthening  WHO/GOARN  capacity  and  readiness  to  support  countries \nthrough  field  teams  and  national  responders.  This  requires  (a)  developing \nstandard operating procedures for technical guidelines and operational protocols; \n(b)  conducting  a  training  course  for  cadre  of  100  national  and  international \noutbreak response; and (c) undertaking a field exercise. \n(ii)  Adapting a field information management system (FIMS) to deliver accurate and \nconsistent information to public health staff on the epidemiology, investigation, \ntreatment and control of outbreaks of avian influenza infection in humans.  \n(iii)  Developing WHO/GOARN virtual networks for epidemiology, social mobilization, \nclinical management and logistics for support to countries and field teams. \n(iv)  Implementing  field  logistics,  mobility  and  communications  to  support  rapid \noutbreak  response  in  field  operations  (e.g.,  delivery  of  emergency  medical \nsupplies, vaccines and antivirals). \n(v)  Developing SOPs for procurement and mobilization of vaccine and supplies, \ndrugs  and  medical  equipment,  deployment  of  specialist  outbreak  response \nequipment, outbreak response logistics capacity and field experience. \n(vi)  Accelerating  the  expansion  of  GOARN  partnership  and  developing  regional \nSOPs (e.g., trigger mechanisms and capacity for rapid response).  \n \n12.  WHO, in partnership with individual countries, will rely on its network of country and \nregional offices, and headquarters to implement a global public health response to a possible \nhuman influenza pandemic. WHO proposes to form regionally-based acute infectious disease \nresponse teams, which will be mobilized when a country requests assistance from WHO.  \n \n13.  ICT for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (WHO). Preparing for a pandemic of avian \ninfluenza requires that resources and capacities are organized to be able to meet the expected \n ", "44  Appendix 6 \nhealth threats of people in affected or at-risk countries. ICT is a core function and service for \nemergency  response;  therefore,  consideration  should  be  given  in  preparing  the  following \nareas\u2014telecommunications, facilities, equipment, systems, and staffing.  \n \n14.  Network Connectivity. Reliable data and voice communications tools are helpful to \ndeliver preventative programs, which rely heavily on health experts sharing information and \nknowledge. Different modes of communication (e.g., data, email, voice and video conferencing) \nwill help deliver key messages in countries and the region; and thus, assist in managing and \ncontaining a possible pandemic. The WHO has been developing and implementing a network \nover the past 2 years to help guarantee connectivity during times of emergency. This network \nhas connected some 82 countries worldwide, and there are plans to reach another 60 over the \nnext 6 months. This network provides data, voice, and video.  \n \nC.  Subcomponent 2.3: Risk Communication \n \n15.  Risk  Communication  Strategy.  Subcomponent  2.3  seeks  to  enhance  risk \ncommunication efforts in Asia and the Pacific Region. The Project will support DMCs and \ncomplement  ongoing  UNICEF  program  aimed  at  ensuring  timely  (i)  sharing  of  information \namong the ministries of health and WHO in accordance with IHR provisions and other agreed \nprotocols  to  assist  in  implementation  of  appropriate  interventions,  and  (ii)  accurate \ndissemination of information to the general public to aid in adapting appropriate behaviors and \nminimize  unnecessary  adverse  consequences  on  the  health  and  economies  of  affected \npopulations. Two indicative activities are included: \n \n(i)  Translation into local dialects, reproduction and distribution of advocacy materials, \nguidelines and other IEC materials to ensure quality of translated materials, reduced \nburden on countries, and appropriateness for target groups. \n(ii)  Development  of  generic  risk  communication  strategy  and  prototype  risk \ncommunication  material.  Prototype  material  for  risk  communication  will  also  be \ndeveloped  and  disseminated  to  individual  countries  for  development  of  country-\nspecific material according to their risk communication strategy. \n ", "  Appendix 7  45 \nOPERATIONAL DETAILS OF SUPPORT FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA RESPONSE FACILITY \n \nA.  The Fund \n1.  The Project will support in a flexible manner emerging initiatives to control both avian \nand human influenza. Component 3 will have a $14.5 million to allow ADB to respond quickly to \nthe emerging needs of developing member countries. This will be used to address emergency \ntechnical needs for preventing and controlling avian and human influenza in developing member \ncountries. Due to the evolving nature of the epidemic and considerable uncertainties associated \nwith the epidemic, the use of the Avian Influenza Response Facility (AIREF) has been kept \nflexible. AIREF will be used for the following type of activities: \n \n(i)  Emergency needs for containing avian influenza outbreaks,  \n(ii)  Emergency needs for responding to human influenza outbreaks, and  \n(iii)  Support for regional stockpiles of essential drugs and equipment, \n \n1.  Emergency Containment of Avian Influenza Outbreaks \n2.  The global strategy to control avian influenza and prevent a human influenza pandemic \nstarts with the controlling the infection at source and effectively containing avian influenza \noutbreaks  among  poultry.  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  and  the  World \nOrganization for Animal Health (OIE) recommend culling of all domestic birds in those areas \nwhere a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus is suspected or has been identified. \nStrict measures of control are also required, including quarantine of the affected area. In some \ncircumstances, when the HPAI virus (in this case, H5N1) is entrenched and avian influenza has \nbecome endemic, poultry vaccination is the alternative.  \n \n3.  Emergency containment, either through culling of poultry, quarantine, or emergency \nvaccination of poultry requires planning and preparedness. As soon as an avian influenza \noutbreak  is  reported,  the  Governments  have  to  deploy  teams  to  contain  it.  Window  of \nopportunity for effectively containing the outbreak is usually small. However, even when plans \nare ready, there may be delays in undertaking containment measures due to lack of training, \npoor planning, and lack of financial resources to implement the plan and cover logistics and \noperational  costs.  The  AIREF  will  cover  these  emergency  needs,  on  the  request  of  the \nGovernment, through government agencies, participating international organizations, and other \npartners.  \n \n2.  Emergency Containment of Human Influenza Outbreaks \n4.  Human influenza pandemic is likely to start within small clusters with limited human-to-\nhuman transmission but the spread will remain localized for sometime during which virus will \nadapt to humans. This corresponds to phase 4 (highly localized clusters) and phase 5 (larger \nclusters, still localized) of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) global surveillance system. In \nthese circumstances, WHO considers that the countries will have a window of about 20 days to \nstop a human influenza pandemic. It is important that countries be ready to react and that \npreparedness action plan be developed in details, with clear instructions for all stakeholders. \nHowever, it will be critical that cash flow impediments do not delay the rapid implementation of \nthe  plan  at  the  onset  of  limited  human-to-human  transmission.  The  AIREF  with  rapid \ndisbursement mechanisms will ensure that cash is immediately available to the countries that \nneed it in emergency. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 7 \n3.  Regional Stockpiles \n5.  Procurement and stockpiling of essential drugs and equipment at the regional level to \nfight a possible human influenza pandemic is a cost-effective option. Given the uncertainties \nabout the timing, geographical coverage, length and severity of the epidemic, all countries may \nnot ultimately need the drugs and some may eventually need only a limited quantity. Therefore, \nit  may  not  be  cost-effective  for  each  country  to  stockpile  large  quantities  of  drugs  and \nequipments.  A  regional  arrangement  for  the  supply  of  essential  drugs  and  equipment  is \nconsidered a cost-effective option. Moreover, smaller countries may find it difficult to effectively \nnegotiate with pharmaceutical companies on their own and obtain the necessary drugs, supplies \nand equipment for fighting the epidemic. A regional arrangement for collective bargaining with \npharmaceutical companies has a better chance of succeeding.  \n \n6.  WHO is planning to establish such a regional stockpile. At this stage, regional stockpile \nof  antiviral  drugs  (Oseltamivir  or  Tamiflu\u00ae),  essential  antibiotics,  and  personal  protective \nequipment are being considered. Stockpiling of other items may also be considered, according \nto recommendations of technical agencies (WHO and FAO). Logistics, supply arrangements, \ncriteria and mechanism for deploying the stocks are being worked out to ensure safe storage \nand  quick  delivery  of  drug  and  equipment  as  soon  as  an  outbreak  is  reported.  Advance \npurchase contracts with suppliers will be used to ensure delivery on demand and save on \ntransportation and storage costs. Financing needs for regional stockpiles are expected to be \nlarge. AIREF will be able to finance only part of these needs and will contribute to larger \nregional initiatives.  \n \nB.  Management of AIREF \n7.  AIREF will receive $9.7 million from Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants1, $0.6 million \nfrom the Technical Assistance Special Fund, and $4.2 million from the Japan Special Fund \n(JSF). The support from ADF will only be used for ADF-eligible countries and will focus on \nproviding a range of support to these countries, including the purchase of drugs, medical \nsupplies, and equipment. It may also support the financial needs of the animal and human \nhealth system to ensure that there is adequate support for their operation. Other countries, \nwhich are not eligible for ADF-financing, will receive support from TASF and JSF largely for \ntechnical capacity building activities, such as training, support for planning, and contracting \nexperts. TASF and JSF may also support activities in ADF-eligible countries, in particular for \nactivities that largely involve technical capacity building.  \n \n8.  The steering committee comprising the heads of all regional departments and Strategy \nand Policy Department and chaired by the director general of the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department will supervise the implementation and use of AIREF and provide the \noverall  policy  guidance.  The  steering  committee  will  decide  when  a  country  or  the  region \nbecomes eligible for use of emergency resources under AIREF. The steering committee will \nreport to the ADB management committee. The steering committee will meet at least once \nevery 3 months and may be called to meet more often, by the chair. Each member of the \nsteering committee shall nominate at least one alternate to ensure that the steering committee \ncan meet in the case of an emergency at short notice.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Through the Asian Development Fund\u2019s support for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.  \n ", "  Appendix 7  47 \n9.  ADB\u2019s  avian  influenza  secretariat  will  provide  the  necessary  advice  to  the  steering \ncommittee when requested or needed. The avian influenza (AI) secretariat may also call upon \nother ADB staff's expertise according to the needs. \n \n10.  The AI secretariat will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project and \nadministrative tasks. \n \n11.  Request  for  funds  to  procure  drugs,  supplies  or  equipment  for  stockpiling  will  be \ntransmitted to the AI secretariat for technical review and assessment. The steering committee \nwill take the final decision. The AI secretariat will consolidate its review assessment within 2 \ndays of receiving the request from the concerned country or regional agency. The steering \ncommittee will decide within 2 days of receiving the secretariat assessment. \n \n12.  The secretariat will also decide about allocation of funds to the affected countries up to \n$100,000.  For  amounts  more  than  $100,000,  the  decisions  will  be  made  by  the  steering \ncommittee. \n \n13.  The  secretariat  will  prepare  a  monthly  report  to  inform  the  management  about  the \nprogress  of  the  Project  and  utilization  of  AIREF.  A  midterm-review  of  the  AIREF  will  be \nundertaken in December 2006, and changes in the use of funds, eligibility criteria, and fund flow \narrangements may be made, as appropriate. \n \n14.  If emerging needs require new Project activities during implementation that may have an \nimpact  on  environment,  resettlement,  indigenous  people,  or  other  vulnerable  groups, \nimplementing partners will each inform ADB and will prepare and submit to ADB for approval \nappropriate  impact  assessment  and  mitigating  plans,  before  requesting  financing  for  that \nparticular activity. This shall be included in new or amended grant agreements.  \n \nC.  Fund Flow Arrangements \n15.  For supporting regional stockpiles, the funds will be transferred to the identified technical \nagency (likely to be WHO), based on a specific request from the agency. ADB will ensure that \nappropriate  logistics  and  supply  arrangements  are  in  place  before  the  release  of  funds. \nAgreements on procurement arrangements, satisfactory to ADB will also be reached with the \nresponsible technical agency. \n \n16.  For  the  emergency  containment  of  outbreaks,  the  following  arrangements  will  be \nfollowed: \n \n(i)  Depending on the need, resident missions may be authorized to approve and \ndisburse a specified amount by the steering committee based on specific request \nfor emergency assistance from the Government or technical agency.  \n \n(ii)  The AIREF support will be primarily used for logistics and operational purpose, \nsuch as purchase of gasoline and per diem for emergency team to visit outbreak \nareas, etc. \n \n(iii)  The AIREF can also be used for the procurement of goods and supplies. The \nsteering committee may authorize country directors to procure the needed goods \nand supplies, if appropriate. \n \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \n(iv)  WHO and FAO will also be involved, as appropriate, and kept informed. \n \n(v)  Detailed guidelines will be developed to ensure that the AIREF responds to only \nemergency needs for activities in line with national plans for containing avian and \nhuman influenza. All the Governments and technical agencies will be informed \nthe process for seeking support from AIREF. \n ", "  Appendix 8  49 \nGRANT RATIONALE AND PURPOSE \n \n \n \n1.  The Project will receive financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for $38 \nmillion from its Special Funds resources (ADF IX Grant Program). ADF has allocated 2% of its \nresources (an estimated $140 million) to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious \ndiseases for ADF-eligible countries. ADF grant financing for HIV/AIDS and other infectious \ndiseases is available to all ADF-eligible DMCs. \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Avian influenza is a highly communicable disease that spreads among domestic and \nwild bird population. Although it has spread to humans, it does not easily transmit among \nhumans. However, if the virus mutates or recombines with a human influenza virus, it could \neasily spread among humans. Avian influenza is a major risk to the human and economic health \nto the region. If it spreads unchecked, it could seriously harm the region\u2019s poverty reduction \nagenda and potentially lead to the loss of several years of progress.  \n \n3.   The  Project  will  contribute  to  efforts  to  reduce  the  risk  from  avian  influenza.  This \nincludes support for prevention activities and, in the case of pandemic influenza, efforts to \ncontrol and minimize the spread of the virus. Both of these activities will contribute to the \nregion\u2019s  efforts  to  reach  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Limiting  the  spread  of  avian \ninfluenza will protect the livelihoods of millions and halting the spread of a human influenza \npandemic will directly impact on the health and welfare of everybody in the region. The Project \nis regional in nature and will focus in supporting regional public goods.  \n \nB.  Proposed Grant Activities \n \n4.  The Project has four components, all of which will receive finance from ADF grant. \nThese are the following:  \n \n(i)  Component  1:  Regional  Capacity  Building.  This  component  will  support \nregional  and  international  organizations  in  the  efforts  to  support  countries \nrespond to avian influenza.  \n(ii)  Component 2: Regional Coordination. This component will support efforts to \nimprove the region\u2019s efforts to improve coordination in research, surveillance, \nand prevention activities. It will also support efforts to improve communication \nand the transparent sharing of information.  \n(iii)  Component  3:  Avian  Influenza  Response  Facility.  This  component  will \nprovide support that can be used flexibly to meet the region\u2019s needs for avian \ninfluenza prevention and control. The Project will respond to request made by \ndeveloping  member  countries  for  support  and  to  regional  and  international \norganizations for support of new initiatives.  \n(iv)  Component 4: Project Management  \n \nC.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n5.  Grant-supported activities will be monitored through the indicators in the Project\u2019s design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n ", "50  Appendix 9 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n  \n \nTable A9.1: Financing Plan by Source \n($ \u2018000) \n  ADF  TASF  JSF  Total \nItem  Grant  Grant a  Grant  Cost \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes   Yes \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?    No   No \nagreement?  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Asia and the Pacific Region: \n \nPoverty reduction in the region has been due to rapid economic growth and significant human capital investment \n(e.g., health and education). A human influenza pandemic in the region could slow down, and even stagnate, the \nrate of economic growth in the region. A pandemic could lead to poor human and animal health, a rise in deaths, \nand a subsequent loss of livelihoods and income. The Project will make an important contribution to minimize the \nprobability of an outbreak of new strain of human influenza through support of preventive activities. It will also help \nto mitigate the harm caused by such an outbreak by supporting efforts aim to control and minimize the spread of the \nvirus. The Project contributes to the region\u2019s ongoing efforts towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \nThe region has seen a substantial reduction in poverty over the past two decades, built on rapid economic growth \nand significant investment in human capital. A pandemic in the region threatens to reverse this process. The avian \ninfluenza (AI) outbreak has already affected the livelihood of small-scale poultry farmers in the region. In the \nMekong subregion alone, the outbreak is estimated to have cost about $580 million in the poultry sector through \nMarch 2005, excluding the loss due to trade restrictions. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has \nestimated the total cost of the outbreak around $10 billion. In case the virus mutates or combines with a human \ninfluenza virus, the spread of AI in humans and possible human influenza pandemic could disrupt, if not stall, the \ncurrent rate of economic growth in the region. The impact on the economy could include higher unemployment rates \nand reduced wages, and an increase in poverty. Households, especially those engaged in the poultry sector, would \nsuffer immediate loss of livelihoods and subsequent decline in household income. Many families might be caused to \nsell their productive assets or dip into their savings to pay for medical care of sick family members. The cost of \nhealthcare associated with prevention and treatment could strain weak social protection and health systems in many \ncountries. The loss of income from those who are unable to work and/or might subsequently die will also have a \nlong-term impact on declining household incomes. The burden of caring for sick family members could increase for \nwomen and young girls. The poor and disadvantaged, in particular, have less access to both public and private \nhealth services, suffer from a higher burden of disease, and face an increased risk of becoming further marginalized \nwhen faced with high cost of medical care, loss of economic livelihoods, and in household income.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \n \n A stakeholder analysis was undertaken to help identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests and \nthe ways in which they affect project feasibility and success. Primary stakeholders include regional technical \npartners, line ministries involved in health and agriculture, preventive health staff and veterinarians at different levels \n(e.g., national, provincial, district, lower community levels such as communes), and communities. Secondary \nstakeholders  include  country  offices  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  technical  partners.  An \ninterdepartmental avian influenza (AI) task force was established to (i) assess the impact of AI under different \nscenarios, (ii) assess the needs of further ADB assistance among member countries, and (iii) further develop \npreparedness  planning  in  the  region.  The  Task  Force  consulted  internally  within  ADB,  and  externally  with \ngovernments, regional and country partners, and technical agencies. The establishment of a stockpile for drugs, \nequipment and supplies will help ensure coordination among development partners and countries in the allocation of \nessential technical assistance and supplies. Information on the AI is posted on the ADB website for public \ninformation and knowledge exchange.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \n \n.A participation strategy is integrated into the overall Project design. A project cell will be established within ADB\u2014AI \nsecretariat\u2014to provide technical feedback and manage administration tasks. A project steering committee, chaired \nby the director general of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, will comprise the directors \ngeneral of all five regional operational departments and the Strategy and Policy Department. ADB will coordinate \ninternally with a project steering committee and will liaison with regional technical partners, ADB resident mission or \nits equivalent, regional cooperation agencies, and other international partners. In order for the Project to be \nresponsive to the needs of the region and country, consultations with key stakeholders in the government and in the \nfield of human and animal health will continue during implementation. The project will strengthen coordination and \nsurveillance activities of human and animal health experts. Support to regional technical partners will involve \nconsultations with communities, including assistance in the development of compensation guidelines for money lost \n ", "  Appendix 13  59 \ndue to poultry deaths.  \nIn addition, coordination with other agencies and mass organizations working with vulnerable communities will help \ndeliver risk communication strategies planned under component 2. The Project will improve information, education, \nand communication (IEC) materials and behavior change communication (BCC) efforts for target populations at risk \nor affected by AI. The importance of providing good quality of care through frontline health staff will help ensure the \nappropriateness of services for different at-risk or affected groups.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nIn the region, women often comprise more than half of the region\u2019s population. The burden of disease profile for \ndisadvantaged groups, especially women, remains heavily influenced by common communicable and infectious \ndiseases, and by morbidity and mortality associated with childbearing. Preventive health staff and laboratory \ntechnicians are often women. In the poultry sector, the division of labor between men and women differ. In Hong \nKong, the influenza cases reported in 1997 indicated that women are at higher risk than men as more were market \nworkers, poultry packers, and health workers. There was little gender differential among those who sought hospital \nhealth care in Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam from 2004\u20132005. \n \nThe Project will invest in strengthening the capacity of regional technical experts to enhance capacity of preventive \nhealth  staff  and  veterinarians  in  surveillance  activities  and  delivering  preventive  and  curative  care.  Where \nappropriate, courses and guidelines will disaggregate the impact of AI and human influenza on women and men. \nWomen and men rely on the poultry sector for different activities for some this is a primary source of livelihood, and \nfor others, poultry rearing and trade may just supplement income. Preventive education materials, i.e., IEC \nmaterials, will be prepared for use in specific communities and will take into consideration special needs related to \nethnicity and gender. The Project will also support equal opportunity for training of qualified women.  \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No \n \nE.

The world is facing a global influenza pandemic, the first since 1968. Efforts to prevent it \nand  to  mitigate  its  impact  are  good  economic  investments.  They  are  classic  examples  of \ninvestments that are public goods and have a high degree of externalities. The Project is part of \na larger global effort to lessen the impact of avian influenza. Governments and international \norganizations are making a major effort to coordinate their activities and to ensure that there is \nadequate financing. Given the public good nature of this investment, it is difficult or impossible \nto attribute success in the battle against avian influenza to any single project or investment.  \n \nA.  Project Objectives \n2.  The overall objective of the Project is to lessen the risk of a potential outbreak of a new \nstrain of flu by reducing the risk of mutation and by lessening the impact of an outbreak. The \nProject is part of a larger, world-wide campaign to fight a potential flu pandemic. Asia is at the \ncenter of an avian influenza outbreak\u2014the disease appears to be endemic in the domestic bird \npopulation of many countries in the region and it is likely that any mutation to a human-\ntransmitted flu will occur in Asia as well. The Project is targeted at low- and middle-income \ncountries in Asia and the Pacific region, however it will positively benefit all countries. The \nProject  focuses  on  two  major  activities,  halting  the  spread  of  the  disease  in  the  animal \npopulation and reducing the impact of a human influenza pandemic if the disease does develop.  \n \nB.  Rationale for Investment \n3.  Regional Public Good. Investing in public health is a good example of a public good. \nDisease prevention and disease control benefits the entire population and it is not possible to \nrestricts the benefits or charge the beneficiaries for the service. The market, on its own, will not \nprovide adequate public health services. This provides strong justification for public intervention. \nGovernments, acting individually, can effectively focus on public health in their own country. \nHowever,  migratory  birds  (an  important  disease  reservoir)  can  easily  cross  borders  and \ncontinue to spread the disease to disease-free domestic poultry populations. Likewise, in an \nincreasingly  globalized  world,  it  is  difficult  to  control  the  entry  of  infected  people.  Without \ncoordination and joint action, the impact of actions of individual countries will be lessened. This \nrequires public health action at the regional level to complement and coordinate country actions.  \n \n4.  The Project will support governments in developing their technical capacity to support \nculling of disease poultry herds. This is an example of an activity with a high externality. \nFarmers do benefit from culling but the cost of culling for them far outweighs their individual \nbenefit. However, the country as a whole benefits enormously from a well implemented culling \nprogram.  Without  government  action  (by  mandate  and  possibly  with  economic  incentives), \nculling will not happen. However most governments have little technical capacity for culling and \nneed substantial support in designing and implementing a meaningful program.  \n \n5.  Economies of Scale and Risk Management. On average, there has been a pandemic \nflu outbreak every 30 years. History has shown that it is not possible to predict the timing, \nvirulence, and impact of a flu pandemic. Some outbreaks have been mild, with low fatalities, \nwhile others have spread quickly and left a large number of dead. It is not efficient for each \ncountry to stockpile expensive equipment and drugs for a pandemic outbreak that may not \noccur or may be milder than predicted. Poor countries do not have the resources and have \nother  priorities.  Likewise,  it  is  difficult  for  producers  to  predict  the  demand  for  drugs  and \nvaccines and they may not have sufficient supply capacity. Goods can be stockpiled at the \n ", "  Appendix 14  61 \nregional level and distributed where and when they are needed, similar to an insurance scheme. \nCountries can also form purchasing alliances and make advance orders to ensure that suppliers \nhave adequate production capacity in the case of an outbreak. Since it is in each country\u2019s \nindividual interest to see the outbreak controlled in other countries, participation in this sort of \nscheme is well justified on economic grounds.  \n \nC.  Economic Impact of a Flu Outbreak \n6.  In evaluating the cost of disease, health economists have traditionally looked at several \ndifferent types of costs.1 First is the direct cost of the disease, which includes the cost of \ntreatment paid by the patient and the second health care system. Second, is the indirect cost, \nwhich  includes  the  economic  loss  due  to  morbidity  and  mortality.  This  also  includes  the \nsecondary impact of the disruption in commerce due to the outbreak. Finally, is the intangible \ncost, consisting of the cost associated with the pain and suffering of a disease. Few studies \nhave been to quantify all of these costs and often a partially is presented.  \n \n7.  At the present, there is no indication of how severe a human pandemic would be. History \nprovides little guidance as each pandemic outbreak has had quite different impacts. Consistent \nwith earlier estimations, the economic analysis uses a 20% attack rate and 0.1% total fatality \nrate.2 In human terms, this would lead to the death of around 3 million Asians and a total 600 \nmillion cases of influenza.3 A common technique to quantify loss due to disease is known as \ndisability adjusted life years (DALY), which sums the lost of life due to early mortality with the \nloss of good health due to temporary incapacity. Assuming the disease incapacitates people for \nan average of 2 weeks, a human pandemic would cost 49.6 million DALYs in lost lives and 20.8 \nmillion DALYs lost to incapacity. This can be moneterized. The loss of life is equivalent to \n$267.2 billion in foregone income that the victims would have earned had they not succumbed \nto disease. The lost in income due to sickness is around $14.2 billion.  \n \n8.  Recent experience with SARS and other diseases show that concerns about public \nhealth can have a major impact on the economy that goes beyond the direct effect of the \ndisease on human health. The analysis examined two scenarios for the psychological impact of \na potential pandemic outbreak. The first scenario assumed a relatively short reaction for two \nquarters, limited to Asia. The second scenario assumed a longer reaction, lasting four quarters, \nand worldwide impact. In both scenarios, two exogenous shocks were introduced, (i) a 3% \ndecline in domestic consumption during the period of impact and (ii) 60% to 70% decline in the \nexport of services during the period of impact. The shocks were modeled using the Oxford \nEconomic Forecasting Global Model, a commercial available model that simulates different \neconomic scenarios for planning purposes.4 Under these assumptions in scenario 1, the total \neconomic impact would be $99.2 billion. For scenario 2, it would be $282.7 billion. Tables A14.1 \nand A14.2 present the demand shocks for a number of key countries. They also include the \nsupply shock due to the loss of workers from death and incapacity.  \n \n9.  Two principle factors explain the large difference between the two estimates. First, the \nlonger duration of the shock increases the impact cumulatively, creating a greater impact on \ntrade  and  investment  and  leading  to  a  greater  decline  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \n                                                 \n1  World Health Organization. 2000.

The effect of each country cutting back on consumption and trade affects all other \ncountries. In this way, controlling the psychological impact of an avian influenza outbreak is a \npublic good as much as controlling the epidemiological impact of the disease.  \n \nTable A14.1: Two Quarters of Demand Contraction, only in Asia \n  Estimated Reduction in Annual    Estimated Reduction in Annual GDP \nGDP Growth, 2006   Levels, 2006 ($ billion) \n(percentage point) \nCountry  Demand Shocka  Supply Shockb    Demand Shock   Supply Shock  \nEast Asia           \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  1.3  0.4    21.4  6.6 \nof China \nHong Kong, China  9.2  0.2    18.3  0.4 \nRepublic of Korea  1.5  0.3    9.1  1.8 \nSouth Asia           \nIndia  1.5  0.3    9.3  1.9 \nSoutheast Asia and Mekong         \nIndonesia  0.5  0.2    1.0  0.4 \nMalaysia  7.1  0.2    7.9  0.2 \nPhilippines  1.0  0.3    0.9  0.3 \nSingapore  10.4  0.4    11.1  0.4 \nThailand  6.3  0.3    9.8  0.5 \n  Total c  2.3  0.3    99.2  14.2 \na Reduction in consumption, trade in services, and investment. \nb Reduction in the labor due to incapacity and mortality. \nc East and South Asia, excluding Japan.  \nSource: Bloom, De Wit, and Carangral-San Jose. 2005.

Potential Economic Impact of an Avian Flu Pandemic on \nAsia. Policy Brief # 42. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 14  63 \nD.  Project Impact \n10.  The goal of the Project is to prevent an H5N1 human influenza outbreak and to mitigate \nits consequences. At the present, the virus is largely present in bird populations and is not easily \nspread among humans. The Project is only one small part of larger package of assistance being \norganized by governments and international organizations for the same purpose. At the present, \nit is not possible to say what the probability is of a mutation to a human-to-human transmissible \nvirus and how virulent such a flu virus will be.  \n \n11.  The Project\u2019s potential impact can be measured in terms of its contribution in reducing \nthe risk of an outbreak (an H5N1 human influenza pandemic). For example, suppose there is a \n50% chance that the virus will not mutate (and thereby cause a pandemic) and that there will be \nno  further  economic  impact  and  a  50%  chance  that  the  virus  will  mutate  and  cause  the \neconomic harm outlined in scenario 2. In this case, it is possible to calculate the expected value \nof the economic impact. There is a 50% chance that it is $0 and 50% chance that it is $297 \nbillion. Thus the expected value of the economic impact is $148.5 billion. The Project may alter \nthe probability of the human-to-human transmission of the virus. For example, if the activities of \nthe project lower the probability of the virus mutating by 0.1%, it will change the expected value \nof the economic impact to $148.2. This implies a savings of $300 million. The total cost of the \nProject is $28 million, implying a very high rate of return.  \n \n12.  This sort of analysis can be repeated for a combination of probabilities and scenarios to \nshow under what circumstances the Project will have a positive economic impact. Using the \nexpected value of economic impact and two scenarios (\u201cpandemic\u201d and \u201cno pandemic\u201d), the \nactually probability of the pandemic makes no difference in calculating the contribution of the \nProject. Only the Project\u2019s contributions to reducing the probability of a pandemic and the cost \nof a pandemic (in monetary terms) affect the calculation. If the Project contributes to reducing \nthe probability of a pandemic by 0.04% and if the pandemic costs more than $100 billion, the \nProject will generate returns of $40 million, which are quite good given the Project\u2019s cost of $28 \nmillion.  \n \n13.  This sort of analysis is a simplification. In addition to the possibility of reducing the \nprobability of a pandemic, the Project also aims to mitigate the impact of a pandemic should it \noccur. The Project will make a contribution to the region\u2019s capacity to limit the spread of a \npandemic. The approval of this Project and similar projects may also contribute to reducing \npublic perception of the danger of avian influenza, lessening the psychological impact of a \npandemic outbreak.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE  6\n4\n    \n \n    \n \n \n   Description  Year  Year2  Year3   A\np\n      Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  pe\nn\n                                                                              d\nix\nComponent 1: Support to Country Responses through   1\n5\n   Regional Agencies                                                                           \n                                                                             \n   1.1.
