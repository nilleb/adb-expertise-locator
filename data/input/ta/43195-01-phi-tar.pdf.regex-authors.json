INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports the priority given by the Government of \nthe Philippines to achieving high-quality universal basic education. In 2009, the government \nconfirmed  its  request  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Computer  Access  Mentorship \nProgram  (CAMP)\u2014a  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  for  Enhancing  Education  Quality. 1  An \nunderstanding with the government has been reached on the goals, purpose, outputs, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants. The design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Philippine Medium-Term Development Plan 2004\u20132010 identifies the achieving of \nuniversal basic education as a major goal of both the National Education for All 2015 Plan and \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, despite good progress in the 1990s and \na continuing high level of commitment, it appears that the government will have difficulty in \nmeeting  the  MDG  target  of  universal  access  to  basic  education  by  2015.  Key  education \nindicators are worsening through increasing dropout levels and lowering academic attainment, \nwhich translate ultimately into higher levels of joblessness and poverty. \n \n3.  The  latest  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  Philippines  2005\u201320072 promotes \nsynergies between the public and private sectors, both because private sector operations can \nhave a catalytic effect upon the public sector, and because the pressure on public resources is \nreduced.3 Education, while not a feature of the country strategy and program, is expected to \nplay a more significant role in the future (country operations business plan 2010\u20132012). The \nproposed project is a good example of a public\u2013private partnership, in which private resources \nand talents are harnessed by two civil society organizations (CSOs) in a concerted effort to \nsupport the public education system and improve the quality of teaching and learning.   \n \n4.  Government policy. In 2001, the Governance of Basic Education Act (Republic Act No. \n9155) was passed, which stressed decentralization of education management and placed the \nschool at the center of reforms to improve the quality of basic education. These reforms were \nfurther  developed  and  implemented  in  secondary  schools  through  the  ADB-supported \nSecondary Education Development and Improvement Project.4 By 2005 there was widespread \nconsensus on the need for urgent sectorwide strategies that would place schools first and \nempower  local  communities  to  achieve  school  improvement.  This  consensus  has  been \narticulated into the Philippine Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda (BESRA). The overall \nobjectives  of  BESRA  encompass  universal  access  to  basic  education  and  its  successful \ncompletion. The five key reform thrusts are (i) continuous school improvement through active \ninvolvement  of  local  stakeholders;  (ii)  better  learning  outcomes  through  improved  teacher \nstandards;  (iii)  learning  outcomes  enhanced  by  national  curriculum  strategies,  multisector \ncoordination, and quality assurance; (iv) improved outcomes resulting from complementary \nlearning systems, and private sector participation; and (v) a change in the Department of \nEducation  culture  from  prescribing  actions  through  directives  to  facilitating  school-based \ninitiatives and assuring quality.  \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 4 June 2009. \n2   ADB. 2005.  Country Strategy and Program: Philippines, 2005\u20132007. Manila. \n3  In 2007, ADB and the Government of the Philippines agreed on an operational program for 2007\u20132008 that \nextended the country strategy and program 2005\u20132007 by 1 year through the country operations business plan \n2007\u20132008. In 2008, ADB and the government agreed on an operational program for 2009\u20132010 that extended the \ncountry strategy and program by 2 more years through the country operations business plan 2009\u20132010. \n4  ADB.  1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Secondary  Education  Development \nImprovement Project. Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  Department of Education policy actively encourages partnerships with civil society and \nprivate sector organizations to meet these goals. As a result, there is an impressive array of \nsocieties of educators, civil organizations, and business groups playing a prominent role in \nsupporting government efforts to achieve universal access and raise quality. Corporate social \nresponsibility efforts are now well organized under one umbrella organization. Other smaller \ngroups have developed programs to address specific critical issues. One such group is the Sa \nAklat  Sisikat  (SAS)  Foundation  which  has  successfully  promoted  reading  among  tens  of \nthousands of children over the last decade in an effective school-based program. However, the \nimpact of the program is constrained by the absence of longer term, ongoing reinforcement of \nteacher skills once each school program finishes. A more broad-based approach able to reach \nlarger numbers of teachers is needed.  \n \n6.  Primary education system. National trends reveal a decline in education access and \neducation quality. National primary net enrolment rates, for example, decreased by 6.5% between \n2002\u20132003 and 2006\u20132007 (from 90% to 84%), and completion rates decreased by 4.8% (from \n72% to 68%).5 When the national figures are disaggregated to focus on the poorest provinces, \nincreasing inequality is evident. The basic education system as a whole is critically overburdened \nand dangerously under-resourced. The Government of the Philippines spends on education, on \naverage,  one  tenth  of  what  is  spent  in  neighboring  countries.  In  2008,  the  national  budget \nallocated P128 billion to basic education, 90% of which was spent on salaries and benefits. The \nremaining 10% is too little to support quality improvement. Of the 1.4 million grade 6 elementary \nstudents who took the High School Readiness Examination in 2004, less than 1% managed a \npassing score in mathematics, English, and science subjects. In the same year, only 2% of high \nschool students achieved a passing score. It is widely acknowledged that poor reading skills play \na major role in this failure. With little motivation to learn, a high 33% of elementary school students \ndrop out before they even reach high school.  \n \n7.  Teacher quality. Better teacher quality is key to improving student learning outcomes. \nThis  is  recognized  by  BESRA,  which  places  improved  teacher  standards  among  its  top \npriorities.  Unfortunately,  most  public  school  teachers  are  ill-equipped  to  overcome  the \nchallenges  presented  to  them.  To  begin  with,  the  training  and  professional  development \nopportunities available to most public school teachers both during their formal education and \nwhile on the job are largely inadequate. Many public school teachers receive a substandard \neducation. While employed in the schools\u2014particularly in rural and other marginalized areas\u2014\nthese teachers have few opportunities for professional development. Thus, year after year, \nteachers continue to use outdated, ineffective teaching methods that fail to capture the attention \nand imagination of their students. \n \n8.  Overcrowding requires schools to operate in shifts, leaving teachers overworked and \nstruggling to balance their work and family responsibilities. Despite their hard work, teacher \nsalaries are low and their take-home pay even lower. Most require a second income and \nconsequently do not have the time or money for further studies. Many public school teachers \nare also the sole earners in their households, which is an added source of stress. With so few \nresources, the public school system can be a disempowering environment. With little support \nfrom administrators and hardworking parents, few teachers feel motivated enough to invest \nextra time and energy in training that might go unrecognized and unrewarded. Many of the \ncountry\u2019s best-trained teachers move abroad. \n \n9.  Lessons learned. Gearing Up Internet Literacy and Access for Students is a major \nproject of the Department of Education that aims to bring internet connectivity to all of the \n                                                 \n5 Department of Education. 2007. BEIS Basic Education Statistics\u2019 Fact Sheet 2007. Manila. ", "  3\ncountry's 6,400 public high schools. This project also trains teachers from connected schools so \nthat they will be able to maximize the internet as a resource for students and care properly for \ncomputers. The SAS CAMP project will complement this initiative. All major e-learning initiatives \nthat have been piloted by the Department of Education and other agencies will be assessed by \nthe SAS at the start of TA implementation, to ensure that the key lessons learned are applied in \nthe design of the program. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The project will help improve basic education by developing an innovative strategy for \nimproving education quality. In particular, the project will address what is widely recognized as a \nfundamental weakness among Philippine students\u2014poor reading skills. The underresourcing of \nbasic education, combined with the high population growth rate, has resulted in a crisis of \nquality which has not been addressed successfully through conventional approaches. Funds for \nthe in-service training of teachers have been severely restricted. A new approach to in-service \ntraining  is  needed  that  will  strengthen  existing  skills  and  expose  teachers  to  the  latest \ndevelopments in teaching. To reach large numbers of teachers who cannot afford to travel and \nwho are dispersed over a wide geographic area, the project will develop and provide access to \nan information and communication technology (ICT)-based training program to improve the \nteaching of reading. This will be undertaken through a new and innovative partnership between \ntwo established CSOs\u2014SAS and the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP). The program will be \nan extension of the current SAS program which improves reading skills through face-to-face \ntraining of teachers. This will be expanded into an online training model. The BSP is a highly \nsuccessful CSO, with 2 million members (the largest scouts movement in the world), 109 \ncouncils, and a close relationship with the public school system through its more than 100,000 \nscout leaders, most of whom are teachers or principals. It also has a well-established network of \ncouncil offices, generally located close to elementary schools.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  expected  impact  is  improved  learning  outcomes,  especially  in  reading,  among \nelementary students covered by the project sites. The expected outcome is a replicable and \nsustainable  ICT-based  in-service  training  program  that  enhances  elementary  teacher \ncompetencies in the teaching of reading, by mid-2013.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed project will build 50 CAMP sites over a period of 3 years, in three phases \ncovering sites in Manila, Northern Luzon, and Visayas and Mindanao. These CAMP sites will \nserve as a place for elementary school teachers to learn new and innovative teaching methods \nthrough the development of (i) online teacher training, (ii) online teaching aids, and (iii) teacher \nmanuals. The program\u2019s desired  multiplier effect  will later spread these new approaches to \nteaching to fellow instructors and, ultimately, to students. The focus of the project will be reading \nskills, which have been identified as the fundamental cause of the weak learning outcomes so \nwidely observed among Filipino students.  \n \n13.  The online program will be based on the training program currently offered by SAS in the \nteaching of reading to public school elementary teachers. Training modules and materials will be \ndeveloped for online strengthening of teaching skills and teacher competences in reading. The \nprogram will consist of around 20 hours of instruction, and it is expected that teachers will complete \nthe program within 1 month. The program will introduce reading theories, principles, and how to \ntranslate  these  into  the  classroom,  and  will  cover  student-centered  and  literature-based \napproaches to the teaching of reading.  \n \n ", "4   \n14.  The Department of Education has demonstrated its support for the project through a \nmemorandum of understanding with SAS. The current SAS training materials and program will \nbe used as the starting point for the online training modules, though SAS recognizes that \nsignificant  adaptation  will  be  required  for  the  online  medium.  A  second  memorandum  of \nunderstanding will be signed with the Department of Education to recognize completion of the \nonline training program as part of teachers' annual in-service credits.   \n \n15.  The CAMP sites will support focused training to enable scout leaders and teachers to \nexploit ICT-based access to information, materials, and networks in adopting pupil-centered and \nactive learning approaches. To ensure the retention of skills and links to actual practice, face-to-\nface training in the BSP council sites will be conducted twice a year. Training-of-trainers will \nprepare three mobile teams to conduct training and basic monitoring. The expected outputs are \nas follows: \n \n1.  Increased  Access  to  Online  Training  Opportunities  in  Reading  for \nElementary Teachers \n16.   The TA will expand access to online in-service training by establishing a nationwide \nnetwork of 50 training facilities through which elementary teachers will be able to complete an \nonline training course on the teaching of reading. The TA will provide 150 computers for 50 \nCAMP sites.6 As the sites selected are near elementary schools, all teachers will have easy \naccess. Schedules for use of the computers will be established to optimize the number of \nteachers undertaking the online training.  \n \n2.  Training  Modules  and  Materials  Developed  for  Online  Strengthening  of \nTeaching Skills in Reading \n17.  The  TA  will  develop  an  online,  modularized  program  consisting  of  animated  and \ninteractive training modules and materials, based on the successful SAS teaching of reading \ncurriculum for elementary teachers. Each module will finish with self-evaluation questions.  \n \n3.  Improved Knowledge among Teachers of Student-Centered Approaches to \nthe Teaching of Reading \n18.  The  combination  of  a  new  online  teaching  reading  curriculum,  increased  access  to \ncomputers, and a managed training schedule is expected to enable 12,000 elementary teachers to \ncomplete in-service reading training online. The program emphasizes student-centered teaching as \nthe most effective approach for the teaching of reading. It is expected that knowledge of student-\ncentered approaches among teachers will increase by 75%. Successful completion of the overall \nprogram will be measured through a final assessment that will be taken online. Certificates will be \nawarded to those who pass. \n \n4.  Monitoring and Evaluation System Established  \n19.  A  comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  be  developed  to  track  the \nprogress  of  the  teachers  as  they  complete  the  program  and  record  the  completion  rate. \nSystematic monitoring and evaluation to generate key lessons learned will be carried out by \nSAS. They will also institute a strategy for automated tracking of ICT tool usage to provide \ninformation on how ICT tools are being used and where improvements are needed. Finally, \nschool visits for training and evaluation will be used to collect examples of grassroots innovation, \nvia video camera and other means, for compilation and dissemination to other public schools.  \n                                                 \n6  Each BSP training room will be equipped with four computers. The Government of the Republic of Korea has \ndonated 50 refurbished computers to the Philippines, which will supplement the computers to be purchased under \nthe TA. ", "  5\n \n20.  An  evaluation  study  will  be  carried  out  by  an  independent  agency  to  assess  the \neffectiveness of the online training program. The study will include a baseline and impact study, \ncovering up to 50 project schools and an additional control sample. The results of the training \nprogram will be disseminated in collaboration with the ADB Institute. \n \n21.  The sustainability of the project is likely, given the strong commitment of both SAS and \nBSP, and the broad opportunities for eliciting funding given the high level of corporate and private \ndonations to education in the Philippines. The project can be replicated without difficulty. Once the \nteachers  at  one  site  are  trained,  the  equipment  can  be  transferred  easily  to  another  site. \nFurthermore, the program can be adopted by any other CSO or corporate group once success is \ndemonstrated. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $632,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for the amount \nof $500,000. The grant will be administered by ADB. SAS will provide $132,000 in in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  ADB will be the executing agency. SAS will implement the TA through a partnership \nagreement with ADB. SAS, a registered nongovernment organization, has been involved in \nupgrading the skills of public elementary teachers in the teaching of reading since 1999. In \ncollaboration with other reputable educational institutions, SAS has created a curriculum that is \nculturally sensitive and appropriate, and has developed a high-quality cadre of trainers who will \nsupport program implementation. The TA will extend the SAS face-to-face training model into an \nonline model that will enable more teachers to benefit from the SAS training program. \n \n24.  SAS  will  collaborate  with  the  BSP  in  TA  implementation,  as  specified  in  the \nmemorandum of agreement signed on 6 January 2010 by the Department of Education, SAS, \nand BSP. A CAMP site administrator assigned by BSP will manage each CAMP site, with the \ncosts  of  running  the  training  facility,  including  the  internet  connection  and  computer \nmaintenance,  paid  by  BSP.  The  equipment  to  be  procured  will  include  computers  and \nperipherals. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time), and will be retained by BSP after the TA ends so that the \ntraining program may continue and be replicated elsewhere. The teachers undertaking the \ntraining will pay a minimal amount to contribute to the cost of the internet connection. A contract \nwill  later  be  signed  between  SAS  and  BSP  to  specify  the  operational  arrangements  and \nobligations in more detail. All disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.7 \n \n25.  SAS will establish a project implementation unit to oversee day-to-day implementation, \nincluding  procurement,  disbursement,  reporting,  and  information  collection.  The  project \nimplementation unit will consist of a SAS project manager who will report to the SAS executive \ndirector and be responsible for day-to-day implementation, and a project assistant. SAS will \nengage four individual specialists: (i) an e-learning specialist to identify key lessons learned in \nprevious online programs, (ii) an instructional developer to develop the online program, (iii) an ICT \nconsultant to develop the software and web-based applications, and (iv) a reading specialist to \nsupport  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  reading  program.

SAS will provide four reports based on the following payment milestones: an inception \nreport (35%), a report on the design of the training program at the end of year 1 and baseline \nsurvey (35%), a report on the implementation in the first 15 CAMP sites at the end of year 2 (25%), \nand submission of final report and final impact assessment (5%). In addition, SAS will provide \nshort 3-montly reports for continuous monitoring by ADB. The TA will be implemented from 1 May \n2010 to 30 April 2013. \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n28.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis from the Government of Korea Computer Access Mentorship Program\u2014a Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership for Enhancing Education Quality, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
