The Government of Bhutan requested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for capacity building to implement its environmental assessment procedures, during the \nCountry Strategy and Program Update Mission in 2004. ADB considered the request favorably \n(i) in view of the need to continue past capacity-building activities in the environment sector to a \nlogical  conclusion,  and  (ii)  in  keeping  with  the  strategy  of  building  institutional  capacity  to \nfacilitate ADB operations in the other key sectors. Technical assistance (TA)\u2014Capacity Building \nto Implement Environmental Assessment Procedures\u2014was therefore programmed for 2005.1 \nThe  scope,  implementing  arrangements,  cost  and  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of \nreference of the TA were initially discussed with the Government in March 20042 and finalized at \na Fact-Finding Mission in May 2005. The impact, outcomes, expected outputs, activities, and \ninputs are summarized in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bhutan has experienced a period of steady and significant economic growth (averaging \n7% per annum) since the 1970s. Economic growth coupled with improvements in basic social \nservices has resulted in remarkable progress: per capita gross domestic product increased from \n$51 in 1961 to $830 in 2004, infant mortality was halved, enrollment in primary education \nincreased fivefold, and life expectancy doubled during that period. This growth trend is likely to \ncontinue in the near to medium term. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy Program (2006\u20132010)3 projects \n7\u20139% annual growth rates over the remaining period of the Ninth Five\u2013Year Plan (2002\u20132007) \n(9FYP) and 10\u201312% growth rates during the first half of the 10FYP.  \n \n3.  Much  of  the  public  investment  program  in  Bhutan  is  financed  by  its  development \npartners.  Therefore,  external  assistance  to  Bhutan  is  also  likely  to  increase  in  the  future, \ncorresponding with the country\u2019s growth projections. ADB alone is expected to increase lending \nto Bhutan by over threefold in the coming years (from a historical average of $7\u2013$10 million per \nannum to about $32 million per annum in 2006\u20132010. The 9FYP represented a 75% increase in \nexpenditure over the 8FYP, and a similar increment is likely with the 10FYP.  \n \n4.  In 1990, the Government adopted the Paro Resolution, pledging to balance economic \ndevelopment  with  environmental  protection  and  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources.  This \nprinciple  of  \u201cenvironmentally  sustainable  development\u201d  is  embodied  in  the  national \nenvironmental  strategy  titled,  The  Middle  Path  (1998)  and  also  in  Bhutan\u2019s  long-term \ndevelopment plan titled, Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness (1999). \nThe  latter  document  stresses  the  need  to  institutionalize  the  capacity  to  undertake \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  as  a  means  of  achieving  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment. Accordingly, an Act to legitimize environmental assessment (EA) procedures (the \nEnvironmental Assessment Act [EAA]) was  passed in 2000 and corresponding regulations \n(Regulations  for  Environmental  Clearance  of  Projects  and  Regulations  for  Strategic \nEnvironmental Assessment) were adopted in 2002. The EAA and Regulations generally reflect \nthe core principles of standard EA practices.   \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 28 January 2005. \n2 During the final tripartite meeting of TA4120-BHU (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \nStrengthening Environment Sector Capacity. Manila.). \n3 Draft circulated for interdepartmental review on 2 June 2005. \n ", "2   \n5.  On the institutional front, the National Environment Commission (NEC) was established \nin 1992. This high-level policy-making and regulatory body is chaired by the planning minister \nand comprises senior officers from different sectors. The deputy minister of environment serves \nas the secretary of NEC and heads the NEC Secretariat (NECS). NECS is empowered under \nthe  EAA  as  the  principal  agency  responsible  for  enforcing  the  provisions  of  the  Act  and \nRegulations. To date, most requests for environmental clearance of projects are referred to \nNECS. However, NECS will soon be unable to cope with the workload involved with processing \nan increasing volume of such requests and the parallel responsibility of monitoring ongoing \nprojects.  \n \n6.  The  EAA  enables  NEC  to  authorize  Competent  Authorities  (CAs)4  to  issue \nenvironmental clearance for projects in the respective sectors, before consent to develop is \nawarded to the same. A provision in the EAA for CAs to assume the functions of NECS will \nease a potential bottleneck in the project approval process. This arrangement of subsidiarity is \nconsistent with the constitution of Bhutan, which is currently being drafted. The Government has \ntherefore awarded high priority to decentralizing responsibility for EA procedures. NECS retains \nthe authority to issue environmental clearance of projects for which the respective CA is the \napplicant. NECS also continues to assume primary responsibility for monitoring compliance with \nthe  environmental  clearance  process  and  is  required  to  report  annually  to  NEC  on  the \nperformance. \n \n7.  Before  decentralizing  responsibilities  for  implementing  the  environmental  clearance \nguidelines, relevant staff from these agencies must be trained in EA techniques and procedures. \nIn addition, high-level policy makers, project proponents, practitioners of EA and contractors of \nlarge civil works projects also need varying degrees of exposure and training in the substantive \nand procedural aspects of EAs. The subject TA aims to provide the required training and \nexposure programs. \n \n8.  ADB has supported Bhutan with capacity building in the environment sector over a \nperiod of time. A TA to formulate sectoral EA guidelines was approved in 1996.5 The TA was \ninstrumental in developing six key sectors guidelines that were adopted in 1999. However, even \nas these guidelines were being adopted, NEC recognized the need for a legal basis to enforce \nenvironmental clearance procedures. Therefore, NEC embarked on the task of drafting the EAA \nand regulations, benefiting largely from the experience gained from implementing environmental \nclearance procedures over the years. The EAA and regulations rendered the sectoral guidelines \nsomewhat dated; hence, NEC sought ADB assistance to revise them and develop additional \nguidelines for some new sectors. ADB conceded and approved a TA in 2003.6 The revised \nguidelines are now being adopted by sector agencies, several of which are designated CA. \nOverall, ADB\u2019s involvement in strengthening Bhutan\u2019s capacity to undertake EAs has been seen \nas a valuable contribution. The TAs have delivered effective outcomes with relatively small \namounts of resources. Although ADB was not directly involved in their drafting, the EAA and \nregulations have benefited from earlier experience gained from the first TA.  \n \n                                                 \n4  CAs are agencies authorized to issue development consent for a project under Article 6.4 of the Environmental \nAssessment Act, 2000. \n5  ADB. 1996.

In  terms  of  overall  impact,  the  TA  will  contribute  to  Bhutan\u2019s  achievement  of  the \nMillennium Development Goals in line with the Paro Declaration (1990) on balancing economic \ndevelopment  with  environmental  protection.  The  specific  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be \nenhancement of the effectiveness and efficiency in implementing EA procedures in Bhutan. This \nwill be achieved by (i) improving the capacity of government officials at all levels to implement \nthe environmental clearance procedures, (ii) improving the technical capacity of EA practitioners \nand proponents of development projects in the country, and (iii) developing a core group of \ntrainers to conduct in-country training in environmental assessment. The impact, outcome, and \noutputs are summarized in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. In phase 1, a program for training of trainers \nin EA procedures will be designed and implemented. A team of trainers will be selected from \namong staff of NECS, CAs, appropriate training institute(s) and selected private institutions \n(e.g., the industry sector and the mining industry). The team will learn about EA procedures of \nother  countries  in  the  region  through  an  exposure  program  comprising  a  study  tour  and \nliterature review. Thereafter, the team will prepare a series of training modules to target a range \nof end users.  \n \n11.  Training modules will target different stakeholder groups including (i) politicians, high-\nlevel public officials, law enforcement officials, and prosecutors who need to be aware of the \ngeneral provisions of the EAA and regulations; (ii) regulators (i.e., staff of CAs, Dzongkhag \n[district]  environmental  committees)  who  are  responsible  for  reviewing  and  approving \nenvironmental clearance documents; (iii) potential practitioners and project proponents who will \nundertake EAs in the course of designing and implementing a development project; and (iv) civil \nworks contractors who undertake infrastructure projects. \n \n12.  A training institute will be identified during phase 1 to host the training sessions that will \nbe conducted during the TA. The institute will be selected from among those approved by the \nGovernment for delivery of external training programs.7 Criteria for selecting the institute will \ninclude (i) relevance of its mandate to the proposed training programs in EA procedures, (ii) \nability to reach potential trainees over a wide geographic area, (iii) willingness to incorporate the \ntraining modules into its core teaching curricula with the intention of continuing similar training \nprograms beyond the TA period, and (iv) flexibility to work with resource persons from outside \nthe institute, such as the trainers developed under the TA. \n \n13.  Phase 2 will be devoted to delivery of a series of training programs adopting the training \nmodules developed during phase 1. Five training programs are scheduled, targeting a total of \n325 participants. The programs will last from 5 to 8 days, except for the high-level programs \ntargeting politicians, judges, and senior bureaucrats. The latter will be limited to a couple of 1-\nday programs. The training programs are staggered over a period of 10 months to provide \nsufficient flexibility to the trainers and the NECS staff who will serve as resource persons in \n                                                 \n7  Government authorized institutes are (i) Royal Institute of Management, (ii) Natural Resources Training Institute, \nand (iii) Royal Bhutan Institute of Technology in Phuensholing. \n ", "4   \naddition to their regular official duties. The modules will also be modified and improved with the \nexperience gained with each training session.  \n \n14.  In addition to the procedural aspects of complying with the EAA, the training modules will \ncover the conceptual foundations, underlying theories, and substantive techniques involved in \nEA. The degree of coverage will vary by target audience and duration of the course.  At the end \nof the TA, NECS will prepare a report evaluating the training programs. More broadly, the report \nwill  cover  lessons  learned  from  enforcing  the  EAA  and  indicate  areas  needing  further \ndevelopment or refinement. This report will be discussed at the final meeting between the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $236,000 equivalent, comprising $65,200 in \nforeign currency and $170,800 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance the total foreign currency cost and $134,800 equivalent of the local currency \ncost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government \nwill finance the balance of the local currency cost equivalent of $36,000 through the provision of \nin-kind contributions. Appendix 2 contains a detailed breakdown of the cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  NECS will serve as both Implementing and Executing Agency of the TA. A TA project \ncoordinator and an alternate will be appointed by NECS before the TA starts. The project \ncoordinator will be responsible for overall administration and coordination of TA activities. NECS \nwill undertake the following key responsibilities (i) facilitate the selection of trainers, (ii) provide \nguidance during development of the training modules, (iii) assist in identifying an appropriate \ntraining institute, and (iv) identify suitable candidates to receive training. \n \n17.  The Government agrees to support the TA by (i) establishing a project management \nteam at NECS comprising a coordinator, an alternate coordinator, and other specialists from \nwithin and outside NECS who will be co-opted on a need basis; (ii) providing office space on \nNECS premises, communications, and other office facilities for the consultants who will be \nengaged under the TA; (iii) providing resource persons and facilities for workshops and training \nsessions; and (iv) providing administrative support for routine TA administration activities.  \n \n18.  The TA will provide 1.5 person-months of international and 8 person-months of domestic \nconsulting  service  inputs.  The  international  consultant  will  be  a  training  specialist  with \nexperience in EA training. The consultant will be responsible for the outcomes related to (i) \npreparing and conducting the study tour, (ii) training of trainers, and (iii) preparing the training \nmodules. The domestic consultant will be an environmental specialist with experience in a wide \nrange of sectors. This consultant will be responsible for effective delivery of the outcomes \nrelated to (i) carrying out the training programs, (ii) modifying the training modules based on \nexperience gained from conducting training programs, and (iii) establishing links with a suitable \ntraining institute. The consultants will work closely with NECS to ensure smooth implementation \nof the overall TA. Detailed terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will \nengage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n ", "  5\n19.  The TA will be implemented in two phases, comprising a period of 15 months in total. \nPhase 1 will cover 4 months commencing in September 2005, and phase 2 in 11 months. The \nTA is expected to be completed by November 2006. Detailed implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.
