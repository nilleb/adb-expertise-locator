In  response  to  international  calls  for  a  doubling  of  water  investments,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Management decided to make water a core business area and \ndouble its water investments through the Water Financing Program (WFP), which was launched \nin March 2006 at the 4th World Water Forum in Mexico City. The WFP seeks to increase ADB\u2019s \ninvestments to more than $10 billion over the period 2006\u20132010, supported by reforms, capacity \ndevelopment, and regional cooperation, to respond to the Asia and Pacific region\u2019s critical water \ninvestment needs.1\n2.  Consistent with ADB\u2019s emphasis on results-based management and accountability, the \nWFP has set an example by publicly announcing the following specific targeted outcomes: (i) \n200 million people with access to safe drinking water supply and improved sanitation; (ii) 100 \nmillion people with reduced risk to floods; (iii) 40 million people with more productive and \nefficient irrigation and drainage services; (iv) integrated water resources management (IWRM) \nintroduced  in  25  river  basins;  and  (v)  improved  water  governance  through  national  water \nreforms  and  capacity  development,  for  which  a  pioneering  set  of  indicators  are  under \ndevelopment. \n3.  Now at its midway point, the WFP has registered a total programmed pipeline of $10.7 \nbillion from 2006 to 2010, of which $2.3 billion was approved during 2006 and 2007. During the \nsame period, the WFP leveraged $2.0 billion from ADB\u2019s clients and partners. Encouraging \nresults were achieved toward the targeted outcomes. These are shown in Appendix 1.  \n4.  Water as a crosscutting core business area of ADB\u2019s operations is supported in its long-\nterm strategic framework 2008-2020 (Strategy 2020)2 under infrastructure and environment. At \nthe Water Leaders Summit of the inaugural Singapore International Water Week in June 2008, \nADB outlined a seven-point agenda for countries to prioritize water investment in the region, \nincluding  (i)  increasing  investments  in  rural  water  services,  both  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation, as well as irrigation and drainage; (ii) developing more bankable urban projects \nthrough  innovative  government-corporate-society  partnerships;  (iii)  collaborating  with \nstakeholders to foster integrated water resources management (IWRM) in river basins and \nintroduce comprehensive sanitation from toilet to river; (iv) adapting to climate change; (v) \nreducing communities\u2019 vulnerability to water-related disasters and strengthening their resilience; \n(vi) improving water governance, performance, and knowledge management; and (vii) using the \nWFP as a platform for working in partnership.  \n5.  To support the implementation of the WFP, the Water Financing Partnership Facility \n(WFPF)  was  established  in  December  2006  to  provide  additional  financial  and  knowledge \nresources  from  development  partners.  The  WFPF  has  two  windows:  project  support  and \nprogram quality support. About 70% of WFPF resources are directed to in-country project \nsupport, and the remaining 30% are allocated to program quality support, including regional \ncooperation. \n6.  The project support window provides resources for demonstration projects in the three \nkey areas of the WFP\u2014rural, urban, and basin water\u2014through in-country work for project \n                                                \n1  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 September \n2008. \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020.\nManila. ", "2\npreparation, implementation, reform, and capacity development. Rural water services projects \naim to improve health and livelihoods in rural communities and include investments in water \nsupply and sanitation, irrigation and drainage, and multiple uses of water in rural communities. \nUrban  water  services  seek  to  support  sustained  economic  growth  in  cities  and  cover \ninvestments  in  water  supply,  sanitation  and  wastewater  management,  and  environmental \nimprovement. Basin water management projects support IWRM and healthy rivers and include \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  and  the  management  of  multifunctional  water  regulation  and \nhydropower  facilities  developed  in  a  basin  context,  flood  management,  conservation  and \nimprovement of watersheds, wetlands and ecosystems, and climate change adaptation. \n7.  The program quality support window facilitates reforms and capacity development and \nhelps  ensure  quality,  synergy,  and  innovation  in  the  implementation  of  the  WFP.  The \ncomponent for knowledge, capacity, and innovation services comprises knowledge products \nand  services,  expert  services,  pilot  and  demonstration  activities  (PDAs),  and  capacity \ndevelopment in sector agencies. The component for regional cooperation supports activities that \nincrease water financing, catalyze reforms, share knowledge and experience, and build capacity \nin critical water sector organizations, including the introduction of performance benchmarking \nservices and peer review processes. The component for engaging civil society provides three \nways for civil society organizations to support ADB-financed water projects, through (i) project \npreparation support, (ii) independent monitoring of project progress and results by civil society \norganizations  where  appropriate,  and  (iii)  capacity  development  to  improve  collaboration \nbetween ADB and civil society organizations.  \n8.  This regional technical assistance (TA) was designed by the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) in consultation with ADB\u2019s Water Community of Practice to \nmake  available  WFPF  resources  to  regional  departments  for  implementing  two  important \nelements of the program quality support window: (i) PDAs, and (ii) knowledge products and \nservices, as described in para. 7 above.  \nII.  ISSUES \n9.  With the setting of substantially higher investment targets under the WFP, regional \ndepartments need access to WFPF resources that will allow them to (i) develop, test, and \ndemonstrate innovative approaches in designing, financing, and implementing water projects \nthat will help meet the WFP objective of increasing water investments and achieve the targeted \noutcomes presented in para. 2 above, (ii) further enhance the knowledge products and tools \nneeded to ensure more informed dialogues with developing member countries (DMCs), and (iii) \nstrengthen upstream work such as pre-investment knowledge and communication support to \naddress sensitive and potentially contentious stakeholder issues.  \n10.  While the importance of water issues is widely recognized in the region, the challenge \nremains to prioritize water in national development plans and provide the economic rationale to \nincrease  investments  in  water-related  infrastructure,  along  with  the  required  reforms  and \ncapacity-development interventions. This has proved particularly challenging for investments in \nrural  water  supply,  rural  and  urban  sanitation,  environmental  improvement,  disaster \npreparedness,  and  climate  change  adaptation.  Armed  with  up-to-date  knowledge,  sector \nassessments, and demonstration projects, regional departments will be better equipped for their \ndialogue with DMCs\u2014including oversight agencies such as ministries of finance and planning, \nas  well  as  sector  agencies\u2014to  (i)  identify  additional  investment  opportunities,  along  with ", "3\nrequired  support  for  capacity  development  and  reform  efforts;  (ii)  develop  new  pipeline  of \nprojects; and (iii) undertake the required project preparation.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be to contribute to achieving the WFP targeted outcomes of (i) \nincreasing the number of people with access to safe water supply, improved sanitation, and \nmore productive and efficient irrigation and drainage services; (ii) reducing the number of people \nexposed to flood-related risks; (iii) introducing IWRM in river basins in the region; and (iv) \nimproving governance through reforms and capacity development. \n12.  The outcome of the TA will be higher demand from DMCs for ADB investment products \nand services.  \n13.  The TA will produce the following outputs, which will allow the outcome to be achieved: \n(i)  more innovative models, methodologies, and approaches distilled from PDAs \nand  fed  back  into  ongoing  and  programmed  projects  for  replication  and \nsubsequent  scaling  up  in  ADB  investment  projects,  including  field-based \nresearch findings that support the formulation of policy recommendations and a \nreform agenda; \n(ii)  communication strategies and plans in direct support of regional departments on \nspecific projects; and \n(iii)  knowledge products and services that meet the needs of regional departments \nand DMCs who look upon ADB as a key knowledge source, including awareness \ntools  to  support  advocacy  work  in  priority  areas  such  as  sanitation,  climate \nchange, and water-related disasters.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA comprises the following components and key activities.  \n15.  Pilot and Demonstration Activities. PDAs are small grant projects designed to provide \nvaluable direct assistance on demand to regional departments and clients in DMCs to enable \nthe testing of new ideas and the validation of innovative development approaches that are \nhighly replicable and can contribute to achieving WFP targeted outcomes. PDAs help water \nproject teams in regional departments to strengthen core operations, including policy dialogue \nand  reform  agenda  formulation,  country  programming,  and  project  preparation  and \nimplementation. Support will be given to applied research in the field. The PDA program has \nexperienced high demand from regional departments since its start in 2001, and the proposed \nTA will replenish resources to extend the program with more activities to be financed. About 40 \nPDAs have been supported to date under various regional TA funded from the Cooperation \nFund for the Water Sector. Examples of preferred topics or areas proposed for further testing \nand demonstration under this TA are expanding services to the poor; innovative financing for \nrural water services; expanding sanitation coverage; appropriate alternative low-cost technology \nfor accelerating water and sanitation services, particularly in water-scarce areas; mainstreaming \nclimate change adaptation in disaster management policy and strategy; enhancing partnership \nwith civil society; implementing IWRM in river basins; and innovative public\u2013private partnership \nmodels. PDA results are expected to guide and encourage positive change among water sector \nstakeholders in ADB and DMCs and inform policy dialogue.  ", "4\n16. Knowledge Products and Services. This component will provide resources to regional \ndepartments for direct knowledge and communication support to projects, knowledge product \ndevelopment, and knowledge and networking events. Direct knowledge and communication \nsupport  to  projects  seeks  to  help  regional  departments  address  sensitive  and  potentially \ncontentious stakeholder issues that may affect investment plans and project implementation. \nThis may include preparing communication strategies and/or plans and corresponding tools for \nengaging stakeholders early in the process, up to actual project preparation and implementation.  \n17.  Support  for  knowledge  product  development  will  assist  regional  departments  in \ntranslating their sector knowledge into written knowledge products such as issues papers, good \npractice  papers,  technical  notes,  management  briefs,  and  others  that  can  be  shared  and \ndisseminated  within  and  outside  ADB  and  can  be  used  to  inform  ADB-DMC  policy  and \ninvestment  dialogues,  accelerate  reforms  in  major  sector  organizations,  and  strengthen \nadvocacy work on priority topics like sanitation and climate change adaptation. Among the \npriority knowledge products are case studies and good practice papers on expanding sanitation \nservices, implementing tariff reforms, and workable public\u2013private partnership models; issues \npapers on willingness to pay, improving regulation, improving the efficiency of water service \nproviders,  enhancing  the  sustainability  and  accountability  of  water  users\u2019  associations, \naccelerating irrigation reforms, and private sector interventions; and technical notes on such \nenvironmental  topics  as  ecological  compensation  for  environmental  services  and  wetlands \nprotection and management. This will support knowledge products commissioned to regional \nwater knowledge hubs and other partners on priority issues such as climate change adaptation, \nfood security, and the like. To facilitate the wider and more targeted dissemination of knowledge \nproducts,  the  preparation  of  a  dissemination  plan  and  actual  dissemination  of  knowledge \nproducts will be supported under the regional TA. The water website will be sustained by the TA \nand further developed to enhance its client focus. The site receives an average of 285,000 visits \nper month.\n18.  Support for knowledge networking will allow ADB to raise its profile as a water sector \nleader in the Asia-Pacific region at such events as the Stockholm World Water Week, Singapore \nInternational  Water  Week,  and  World  Water  Forum.  This  component  will  support  regional \ndepartments  in  building  in-country  and  subregional  knowledge  cooperation  that  will  help \nimprove the coordination of in-country work with development partners and, at the same time, \nsupport staff development. It will also support the organization of study visits for ADB staff and \nDMC counterparts to facilitate face-to-face knowledge sharing and information exchange within \nand across countries. \n19.  Detailed activities and outputs are presented in the design and monitoring framework in \nAppendix 2. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is $2.0 million, with $1.2 million to be financed from the Multi-\nDonor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility and $0.8 million from the \nNetherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility. It is a grant to be \nadministered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  ", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. The Energy, Transport and Water Division \n(RSID) in RSDD will be responsible for coordinating TA activities in collaboration with regional \ndepartments and with support from dedicated consultants in the areas of fund administration, \nweb management, sector data and statistics, event organization, and administrative support. TA \nprogress will be monitored by the Water Committee and the Water Community of Practice.  \n22.  Approximately 20 person-months of international consultancy and 90 person-months of \nnational will be needed to implement the activities of the TA. The major areas of expertise \nrequired  are  expected  to  include  the  policy,  institutional,  social,  environmental,  technical, \neconomic  and  financial  disciplines  related  to  water  investments,  reforms,  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Further, international and national consultants may be recruited to fill the skills \ngaps in ADB. The consultants will mostly be recruited as individuals, although there may be \ncases in which a consultancy firm may be engaged, such as for some of the PDAs. ADB and \nthe implementing agencies of PDAs will recruit consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. \n23.  PDAs  may  be  proposed  by  ADB  staff;  government  agencies  in  DMCs  in  national, \nsubregional, and local governments; international and national nongovernment organizations; \nacademic  institutions;  and  research  organizations.  Any  of  these  PDA  proponents  may  be \nselected by ADB to serve as an implementing agency. A letter of agreement between ADB and \neach PDA implementing agency will stipulate compliance with ADB\u2019s policies and procedures, \nincluding applicable safeguard policies. \n24.  Equipment and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured by the consultants, \nADB,  or,  in  the  case  of  PDAs,  the  implementing  agencies  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Ownership of the equipment \nand materials purchased for specific activities, such as under a PDA or for training, will normally \nbe transferred to the implementing agency and beneficiaries. This will be clearly spelled out \ncase by case in the letters of agreement and consulting contracts, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nnormal procedures for TA. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time).\n    \n25.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from November 2008 to November 2010. \nRSID will prepare required progress reports as inputs to WFPF semi-annual and annual reports \nto financing partners and will monitor TA activities and make reports available through the ADB \nwater website. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility; and \n(ii) ADB administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Netherlands  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility for Knowledge and Innovation Support for ADB's Water Financing Program, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.

The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  describe  the  main  tasks  under  this \nregional technical assistance (TA). The two components of the regional TA are used in this \nsection to describe the specific tasks to be undertaken under the TA. The Energy, Transport, \nand Water Division (RSID) of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will coordinate the program of activities in close consultation \nwith regional departments, the Water Committee, and the Water Community of Practice. \nA.  Pilot and Demonstration Activities \n2.  ADB  staff,  government  agencies  in  developing  member  country  (DMC)  national, \nsubregional, and local governments; international and national nongovernment organizations; \nacademic  institutions;  and  research  organizations  may  propose  pilot  and  demonstration \nactivities (PDAs). Each of these proponents, except ADB staff, may act as a PDA implementing \nagency through a letter of agreement executed with ADB, except in cases where consulting \nservices by international and national organizations will be required, in which case they will be \ndirectly selected by ADB using its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n3.  PDAs will, for the most part, complement ADB water operations and should be driven by \nthe needs of regional departments and project officers. Regional department endorsement is \nrequired for PDA proposals submitted by external proponents. PDA proposals are submitted to \nRSID for initial technical evaluation and, if found eligible, endorsed to an interdepartmental PDA \nadvisory panel for approval. \n4.  The PDAs constitute a small-grant program to help ADB project teams test and/or \ndemonstrate new and innovative approaches, confirm their efficacy, and then implement or plan \na replication program during project preparation and implementation or through advisory TA and \nother sector work. Activities can include applied research in the field.  \n5.  In prioritizing requests for PDAs, the following criteria will be used: (i) originality of \nconcept, (ii) replicability, (iii) pro-poor focus, (iv) participatory development and gender inclusion, \n(v) operations  support,  (vi) collaborative  approach  using partnerships,  (vii) technically  strong \ndesign, and (viii) consistency with ADB\u2019s water policy. Examples of preferred topics or areas for \ndemonstration and further research include expanding services to the poor; innovative financing \nfor  rural  water  services;  expanding  sanitation  coverage;  appropriate  alternative  low-cost \ntechnology for accelerating water and sanitation services, particularly in water-scarce areas; \nmainstreaming  climate  change  adaptation  in  disaster  management  policy  and  strategy; \nenhancing partnership with civil society; implementing integrated water resources management \nin river basins; and innovative public\u2013private partnership models.   \n6.  A PDA is expected to be implemented over 6 months, on average, and 12 months at \nmost. PDAs should not duplicate or substitute for ongoing or pipelined activities in the DMCs but \nshould be directly relevant to the sector outcomes cited in the country partnership strategy. \n7.  The management of the PDA facility will be assisted by (i) a fund or PDA manager who \nwill carry out the technical evaluation of PDA proposals, review reports, analyze and compile ", "Appendix 4  13 \nresults and lessons learned for scaling up and replication, and prepare the required documents \nsuch as the letter of agreement and government concurrence; and (ii) an accounting assistant \nwho will facilitate the review of claims for payment to facilitate the payment process, coordinate \nfinancial matters with PDA executing agencies, and prepare accounting and financial reports. \nApproximately 24 person-months of domestic consultancy will be required. The budget will \nprovide for carrying out independent outcome evaluation of completed PDAs to strengthen the \nresults focus of the regional TA reports, consistent with the result focus adopted for Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility semi-annual progress and annual reports to financing partners. \nApproximately 2 person-months of international monitoring-and-evaluation consultancy will be \nrequired.\nB.  Knowledge Products and Services  \n8.  International and domestic water specialists will be engaged on an individual intermittent \nor full-time basis to do the following: \n(i)  Provide communication support on demand to regional departments before and \nduring  project  preparation,  as  well  as  during  implementation,  to  help  them \naddress sensitive and potentially contentious stakeholder issues that may affect \ninvestment  plans  and  project  implementation.  This  may  include  stakeholder \nanalysis;  the  preparation  of  communication  strategy  and/or  plan  and \ncorresponding tools for engaging stakeholders early in the process, up to actual \nproject  preparation  and  implementation;  and  a  mechanism  for  information \ndissemination  and  feedback  to  facilitate  sustained  communication  with  key \nstakeholders, such as through a website, focus group discussions, stakeholder \ndialogues, and other tools. \n(ii)  Promote  knowledge  generation  and  knowledge  product  development  and \ndissemination on priority water topics, such as case studies and good practice \npapers  on  expanding  sanitation  services,  implementing  tariff  reforms,  and \nworkable public\u2013private partnership models; issues papers on willingness to pay, \nimproving  regulation,  improving  the  efficiency  of  water  service  providers, \nenhancing  the  sustainability  and  accountability  of  water  users\u2019  associations, \naccelerating irrigation reforms, and private sector interventions; and technical \nnotes  on  such  environmental  topics  as  ecological  compensation  for \nenvironmental  services  and  wetlands  protection  and  management.  This \ncomponent will support knowledge products commissioned from regional water \nknowledge hubs and other partners on priority issues such as climate change \nadaptation, food security, and the like.  \n(iii)  Assist regional departments in updating water statistics and conducting analysis \nof water sector data, which will provide useful information for preparing project \ndocuments; making presentations, speeches and news releases; and developing \nknowledge products. This will include enhancing water sector and WFP reporting \nwith a focus on outcomes and results. \n (iv)  Assist regional departments in carrying out assessment of critical constraints and \nfactors that inhibit the scaling up of water sector best practices across the region \nand recommend strategic approaches to ensure the sustainability of water sector \ninvestments in a more practical and integrated manner, as required by client \ncountries, based on the success of ADB's assistance across the region \n (v)  Facilitate the establishment of knowledge partnerships and alliances to benefit \nfrom the wider exchange and cross-fertilization of knowledge and information on \nlessons learned and good practices. ", "14 Appendix 4 \n (vi)  Organize or facilitate ADB participation in major events, notably the Stockholm \nWorld  Water  Week,  Singapore  International  Water  Week,  and  World  Water \nForum, as well as regional and in-country conferences including study tours \ndesigned  to  facilitate  knowledge  and  information  sharing  as  well  as  provide \nvenues for policy dialogue and strategic discussions with DMC counterparts. \n (vii)  Organize  WFP  in-country  follow-up  conferences  and  country  dialogues  on \nsanitation  to  support  the  WFP  objective  of  increasing  water  investment  and \nsanitation coverage.  \n (viii)  Facilitate the dissemination of ADB knowledge products within and outside ADB \nthrough various means such as the water website, Water Community of Practice \nmonthly events, and blue bag seminars, including presentations by ADB staff at \nexternal conferences. The water website will be regularly upgraded to respond to \nthe information need of clients within and outside ADB. It will make available \nwater sector statistics from DMCs; national water sector profiles, policies, laws, \nand sector roadmaps; a compilation of useful practices and local water actions, \nincluding the showcasing of water champions; and links to water knowledge \ncenters outside ADB.\n9.  The knowledge products and services component will require approximately 18 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultancy,  which  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  in-house  expertise  in \nundertaking policy dialogues, reform advocacy, stakeholder communication, and knowledge \nproduct development. The areas of expertise include water policies, laws, and regulations; \ngovernance  and  institutional  development;  public\u2013private  partnership;  tariffs  and  subsidies; \nutility operations and management; rural water supply and irrigation; sanitation and wastewater \nmanagement;  urban  and  small  town  water  supply;  water  resources  and  their  integrated \nmanagement; climate change adaptation; water-related disasters; development communication; \norganizational development; and results-based management. It will require approximately 66 \nperson-months of domestic consultancy in the fields of urban, rural, and basin water, as well as \non  website  administration  and  management;  knowledge  product  dissemination;  water \nknowledge product writing, editing, and packaging; water sector data management; and water \nevent facilitation and management.
