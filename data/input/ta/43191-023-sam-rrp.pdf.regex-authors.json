THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  subprogram 2  of  the  Economic  Recovery  Support \nProgram (ERSP).1 \n \n2.  The Samoa ERSP is a program cluster of two subprogram loans totaling $26.82 million.2 \nThe  ERSP  cluster  aims  to  assist  Samoa\u2019s  economic recovery  and movement to  a  higher \nmedium-term growth rate, following the double impact of the global economic crisis and the \nSeptember 2009 tsunami. Subprogram 2 of the program cluster will support improved fiscal \nmanagement  and  structural  measures  that  will  help  place  the  economy  on  a  sustainable \nmedium-term growth path. Budget support will finance the fiscal deficit to enable raised levels of \ncapital spending over the medium term. This will be complemented by measures that enable \ntargeting of services to protect the vulnerable and by engagement with key stakeholders. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Samoa\u2019s real per capita income growth since the mid-1990s has been significantly \nhigher than for most other Pacific island countries underpinned by prudent fiscal and monetary \npolicies and structural reforms. Its reforms have steadily strengthened the economy\u2019s resilience \nto  external  shocks. The  economy  is  led  by the  tourism,  agriculture, and  fishing  industries \nenabled by Samoa\u2019s natural beauty, well-educated labor force, and ample land and marine \nresources. Remittances, typically equivalent to around 25% of gross domestic product (GDP), \nplay an important role in the economy. Despite this sound base, the Samoan economy was \nseverely affected by the global recession commencing in 2008. Local manufacturing jobs were \nlost, while offshore jobs were lost in the tuna processing industry. Remittances were down 18% \nyear-on-year at the weakest point. In addition, construction recorded a significant decline, while \nagriculture and fishing suffered from poor harvests. As a result, real GDP fell by 5.1% in FY2009, \nthe worst slump in 2 decades. Government revenue was 4.7% below budget estimates, and a \ndeficit of 4.3% of GDP was sustained. Adding to this, the physical cost of the 2009 tsunami, \nwhich was estimated at $60 million (over 10% of GDP), weakened the economic outlook.3 \n \n4.  The program cluster was designed to support the government\u2019s response to the external \nshocks through short-term fiscal adjustments, as well as to maintain the reform agenda as the \nfoundation for  continuing growth.  The  ERSP  policy  matrix  was  developed from  a  country-\ndeveloped matrix, which sets out the government\u2019s priority policy actions from the Strategy for \nthe Development of Samoa (SDS), 2008\u20132012 and supporting sector plans. This matrix was \nused by the World Bank to release funds in parallel with subprogram 1 and subsequently by the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  in  collaboration  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), to release performance-linked budget support in June 2011.4 Due \nattention has been given to ensuring country ownership, understanding government capacity, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010.

See also: Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management; \nEconomic and Fiscal Analysis; Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n4  In May 2011, a joint ADB\u2013AusAID fact-finding mission for the subprogram 2 loan assessed government progress \nagainst its own policy matrix actions and supported the release of A$2.1 million of AusAID funds in June 2011.  \n ", "2 \nbuilding  on  consultation  processes,  and  embedding  the  program  within  ADB\u2019s  long-term \ncommitment to assistance.5  \n \n5.  Subprogram 1, which was completed in 2010, achieved improved fiscal management \nand implementation of structural measures to aid economic recovery and help protect the \ndelivery of basic services to the vulnerable. Through the program, and among other reforms, the \npublic finance management (PFM) reform plan was pushed ahead, the pace of state-owned \nenterprise (SOE) reform was raised, the telecommunications sector was liberalized, actions to \nmeet the needs of those affected by the tsunami were taken, and the primary school fee-free \nscheme was introduced.  \n \n6.  The  ERSP  loan  and  financing  from  other  development  partners  supported  the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  fund  fiscal  deficits  and  raise  development  (capital)  expenditure  in \nFY2010  and  FY2011.  This  stimulated  economic  activity  and  supported  the  private  sector. \nActivity generated by post-tsunami reconstruction work was largely responsible for holding the \ncontraction to 0.2% in FY2010. Growth is estimated to have been 2.1% of GDP in FY2011, as a \nresult  of  reconstruction  work  and  the  rebound  in  transport,  communications,  tourism, \nremittances, and manufacturing activities.6  \n \n7.  Subprogram 2  completes  the  program  reform  agenda  under  the  ERSP  cluster. \nSubprogram 2 is consistent with the strategic focus of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \n2008\u201320127 to address binding constraints to growth, including deficiencies in access to public \nservices and in the quality of public service delivery, and weaknesses in the private sector-\nenabling environment. Subprogram 2 of the ERSP cluster supports the government\u2019s economic \nand financial reform program in coordination with key development partners including Australia, \nthe European Union, and the World Bank.  \n \n8.  During  preparation  of  subprogram 1,  13  triggers  were  identified  for  subprogram 2. \nConsultation with the government on the evolution of priorities and the context of reform has \nallowed 19 prior policy actions to be finalized for subprogram 2. The instances in which triggers \ndid not directly translate into a single policy action comprised the following: \n(i)  Under output 1 (post-tsunami reconstruction needs addressed), the one trigger \nprovided for three actions to reflect the government\u2019s movement beyond the \npost-tsunami reconstruction plan to a national infrastructure strategic plan. \n(ii)  Under  output  2  (fiscal  responsibility  maintained),  the  trigger  focusing  on \nimplementation of the PFM reform plan generated two policy actions to more \nclearly reflect the achievements of the PFM reform plan (phase 1) and the scope \nof government commitment under the PFM reform plan (phase 2). \n(iii)  Under output 3 (productivity enhancing structural and governance improvements), \nthe trigger area bringing SOEs into alignment with the Public Bodies Act 2001 is \nbeing approached in two steps by the government given the scale of the task. \nThe  policy  action  reflects  this  and  acknowledges  that  the  government  has \n                                                \n5  Key sources of lessons guiding the design of the cluster and subprogram 2 are ADB. 2009.

An additional policy \naction has been included to reflect the government\u2019s expanded commitment to \nSOE  reform\u2014through  funding  commencement  of  the  privatization  of  the \nAgriculture Stores Corporation. \n(iv)  Under output 3, the trigger for creating the Office of the Power Regulator has \nbeen developed into two actions to reflect that the government has gone beyond \nthe trigger by making a budget allocation for the office in FY2012. \n(v)  Under  output  3,  the  two  triggers  reflecting  reform  of  the  business  legal \nenvironment are being progressed but delays have been experienced, and the \npolicy actions reflect appropriate milestones. \n(vi)  Under  output  4  (targeted  support  for  the  most  vulnerable  members  of  the \ncommunity), the trigger of a concept paper on vulnerability issues was overtaken \nby considerable work across government on poverty analysis and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals; the policy action reflects the range of work undertaken.   \n \n9.  Of the 19 policy actions, 17 have been fully accomplished and gazettal of the Electricity \nAct 2010 and cabinet consideration of the personal property securities bill are at advanced \nstages. Completion of these two actions are conditions to the effectivity of the loan agreement. \nThe policy matrix provides details on the status of subprogram 2 policy actions. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be the achievement of a higher and more inclusive economic growth \npath. The outcome will be economic recovery combined with protection of the vulnerable and \nthe country\u2019s fiscal position. ADB financing will be used to help meet the government\u2019s overall \nbudget  financing  needs,  which  have  increased  as  a  result  of  post-tsunami  investment  in \ninfrastructure and buildings.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The policy actions of subprogram 2 are grouped within five output areas: (i) addressing \npost-tsunami reconstruction needs, (ii) maintenance of fiscal responsibility, (iii) productivity-\nenhancing  structural  and  governance  improvements,  (iv)  targeted  support  to  the  most \nvulnerable members of the community, and (v) improved consultation and engagement with \nstakeholders. Policy actions in support of these output areas are discussed below.  \n \n12.  Output  1:  Post-tsunami  reconstruction  needs  addressed.  In  response  to  the \nreconstruction  requirements  following  the  2009  tsunami,  and  in  an  effort  to  stimulate  the \nsluggish economy and create local jobs, Samoa\u2019s capital expenditure was raised 50% above \nFY2009 levels in FY2010 and was 26% above FY2009 levels in FY2011, utilizing the fiscal \nspace generated by the subprogram 1 loan. In compliance with the program, the FY2010 and \nFY2011 capital expenditure were guided by an interim update of the public sector investment \nplan, which included a post-tsunami reconstruction plan to be implemented over a 4-year period. \nReconstruction, including construction of new infrastructure, facilities, and housing in relocation \nareas, was largely completed by the end of FY2011. \n \n13.  The need for increased capital expenditure remains. As well as the completion of post-\ntsunami  reconstruction  work  (a  new  cross-island  road,  further  seawalls,  completion  of \npermanent water supplies, and four schools), the national infrastructure strategic plan endorsed \nby the cabinet development committee sets out government investment plans across a number \n ", "4 \nof sectors for 2011\u20132015.8 Subprogram 2 supports development of the plan and creates the \nfiscal space for continued heightened capital expenditure in the FY2012 budget\u2014estimates are \n7.1%  above  the  FY2009  level.  Bilateral  development  partners  are  expected  to  support \ninfrastructure investments beyond FY2012; the government favors grant support. \n \n14.  Output 2: Fiscal responsibility maintained. Output 2 will support the medium-term \ngoals of fiscal discipline and improving transparency, accountability, efficiency, and equity in the \nuse of public funds. A sound fiscal framework promotes the operational and fiscal sustainability \nof capital projects. To promote fiscal sustainability, the FY2012 budget was prepared against a \nmedium-term  expenditure framework  (MTEF) that  included  a fiscal strategy  statement, the \npreparation  of  forward  estimates,  and  a  statement  of  government  operations  prepared  in \naccordance with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Government Finance Statistics standards.  \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic and Budget Aggregates, FY2011\u20132014 \n \nItem  Target  FY2011  FY2012  FY2013  FY2014 \nReal GDP (% change)  3.0\u20134.0  3.1  2.3  2.4  2.0 \nInflation (%)  3.0\u20134.0  3.3  3.3  3.3  3.3 \nBudget balance (% GDP)  (3.5)\u20133.5  (9.3)  (6.5)  (6.4)  (6.1) \nCurrent expenditure (% GDP)  35.0\u201338.0  27.2  25.6  28.8  27.3 \nPersonnel costs (% current  30.0\u201332.0  30.0  38.8  40.2  40.0 \nexpenditure) \nPersonnel costs excluding SOE      30.0  27.0  28.4  27.0 \nsalary costs (% current \nexpenditure)a \nDisbursed outstanding debt (% GDP)  Less than 40.0  47.0  53.0  53.0  55.0 \nCurrent account balance (% GDP)    (9.6)  (8.6)  (8.3)  (7.7) \nImport cover (months)  4.0\u20136.0  6.4  7.4  8.2  9.2 \nNominal GDP (ST million)  1,616.2  1,544.9  1,630.2  1,725.0  1,817.9 \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  This presents personnel cost data using the methodology used prior to FY2012.

Apia: Government of Samoa. \nAdditional data from Ministry of Finance. \n \n15.  The macroeconomic and budget aggregates of the FY2012 budget show an expectation \nof a return to sound economic growth levels (Table 1). Heightened growth, and with it higher \nrevenue receipts, will support efforts to reduce the budget deficit, which is expected to remain \noutside target levels through FY2014. Nonetheless, the FY2012 budget has brought forward \nfiscal consolidation in comparison to the MTEF underlying the FY2011 budget, which projected \na deficit of 8.6% in FY2012 and a similar level in out-years. The fiscal consolidation has both \nsqueezed current expenditure and included efforts to raise revenue. Revenue measures focus \non improved compliance and some raising of taxes, fees, and charges without undermining the \nimpetus for private sector-led growth. The government is aware that the intended annual fiscal \ndeficits of over 6% over this period hold risks\u2014for example, the government would find it hard to \nadjust to any external shocks\u2014and macroeconomic management and fiscal sustainability have \ntherefore been prioritized. \n \n16.  Subprogram 2  provides  for  maintaining  an  MTEF  that  is  consistent  with  fiscal \nsustainability, preserving a low risk of debt distress as assessed by the IMF. The government \nhas acted to reduce the level of fiscal stimulus that proved so successful in returning Samoa to \na steady growth path. Elements framing the budget include the following: (i) priority has been \ngiven to implementation of the tsunami recovery plan and spending on focal areas highlighted in \n                                                \n8  The cabinet development committee comprises the cabinet, chief executive officers of ministries and SOEs, and \nsenior officials.  \n ", "5 \nthe SDS; (ii) current expenditure as a percentage of GDP is forecast to be below the target rate \nas a result of reduced expenditure programs of ministries and corporations through FY2014, in \nline with the aim to reduce the budget deficit;9 (iii) personnel costs as a percentage of total \ncurrent expenditure have exceeded the target range because of the inclusion of SOE salary \ncosts for the first time in FY2012 in compliance with the IMF Government Finance Statistics \nformat, but the flat out-year trend demonstrates commitment to restraining this cost element; \nand (iv) the government debt strategy aims to constrain new borrowing in the medium term to \nreduce debt, in line with the subprogram 2 commitment to maintaining a \u201clow level of debt \ndistress\u201d rating.   \n \n17.  Samoa has a good track record in prudently managing public debt, almost all of which is \nexternal. In 2010, the IMF advised the use of concessional financing to ensure the capacity to \nabsorb  future  shocks  without  risking  an  unsustainable  debt  burden. 10  In  FY2011,  the \ngovernment entered into two new concessional loans from the People\u2019s Republic of China \ntotaling ST52 million, but the IMF assesses that Samoa remains at low risk of debt distress.11 \nImplementation of the debt management strategy (approved by the cabinet in December 2010) \nwill aid in the medium-term stabilization of debt below the target ceiling (initially breached in \nFY2010).  \n \n18.  Samoa\u2019s PFM reform plan provides the foundation for sound budget formulation and \nimplementation,  and  has  been guided  by the findings  of the  2010  public  expenditure  and \nfinancial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment.  Subprogram 2  supports  the  completion  of  key \nelements of phase 1 of the PFM reform plan: (i) bringing the public accounts up to date, \ncompleting the treasury instruction; (ii) use of the Samoa expenditure and revenue forecasting \nmodel  to  inform  the  MTEF;  (iii)  development  of  a  medium-term  debt  strategy;  and \n(iv) completion of a development cooperation policy. In December 2010, the cabinet endorsed \nimplementation of phase 2 of the PFM reform plan, in line with subprogram 2, which will include \n(i)  integration  of  development  partner  funding  in  budget  estimates;  (ii)  improved  budget \nperformance measures linked to the SDS and sector plans; (iii) establishment of a procurement \nunit  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF);  (iv)  development  of  an  internal  audit  framework; \n(v) implementation of the debt management strategy; and (vi) development of a communications \nstrategy to strengthen consultation and dialogue on policy reform, investment planning, and \nbudget strategy. \n \n19.  The government has demonstrated its practical intent to continued transparency, as \npromoted by subprogram 2, through the public release of the 2010 IMF Article IV Staff Report. \nOther key economic and fiscal documents\u2014PEFA, budget papers and statements, quarterly \neconomic updates\u2014are also publicly available through government websites.  \n \n20.  Output  3:  Productivity  enhancing  structural  and  governance  improvements. \nStructural  and  governance  improvements  will  provide  the  productivity  gains  necessary  to \nsupport  medium-term  growth.  There  are  26  SOEs  in  Samoa;  under  subprogram 2,  the \ngovernment  is  bringing  these  into  compliance  with  the  Public  Bodies  (Performance  and \nAccountability) Act, 2001 on the appointment of board members. The boards of 16 SOEs were \ndismissed in early 2011 and a rigorous process was entered into to identify and appoint new \ndirectors. This was done through a three-person independent selection committee, making use \n                                                \n9  Substantial grant funding for initial tsunami rehabilitation has helped to narrow the budget deficit\u2014from 11.0% of \nGDP in FY2010 to 9.3% in FY2011. \n10  The 2010 debt sustainability analysis found Samoa to remain at low risk of debt distress, based on the low-income \ncountry debt sustainability analysis. Samoa\u2019s classification as a \u201cstrong performer\u201d means the relevant thresholds \nare 50% for present value of debt to GDP, 25% debt service to exports, and 35% debt service to revenues.  \n11 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nof clear and transparent selection guidelines, and over 300 candidates were interviewed. The \nComposition Act passed in the August parliamentary session amended all of the SOE-specific \nacts to align the selection and appointment process to that set out in the Public Bodies Act and \nregulations. The 16 SOEs had new boards appointed by the cabinet in late August, while the \nboard positions for the remaining 10 SOEs are to be advertised subsequently. \n \n21.  In addition to improving the oversight of SOEs by the boards, the government has \nsought opportunities to divest SOEs as part of subprogram 2. SamoaTel was privatized in \nMarch  2011  when  the  government  sold  75%  of  its  shareholding  to  Blue  Sky  SamoaTel \nInvestment and placed the remaining 25% in the Unit Trust of Samoa, which will pay the \ngovernment the agreed value of the shares within 5 years. The government intends to privatize \nthe Agriculture Stores Corporation in 2012, having allocated funds for undertaking a scoping \nstudy in the FY2012 budget, which will update and build on earlier work undertaken with ADB \nsupport.12 Legislation has been passed creating  the Office of the Power Regulator, which \nseparates governance and operational responsibilities in the electricity sector. Follow-through \non implementation of the office is demonstrated by the government\u2019s FY2012 budget allocation.  \n \n22.  The  legal  environment  for  business  is  also  being  improved  under  subprogram 2. \nImprovement in the climate for foreign investment is supported by amendments to the Foreign \nInvestment Act, 2000, creating greater clarity in the scope of both reserved and restricted \nbusiness areas, as well as putting in place clear criteria for adding to, or removing from, either of \nthese lists. These have been approved by the cabinet for tabling in the October sitting of \nParliament. The intended amendments are compliant with Samoa\u2019s accession to the World \nTrade  Organization  and  were  subject  to  widespread  stakeholder  consultation.  Foreign \ninvestment regulations supporting the amended act have been approved for assent by the head \nof state. Prior to this, there were no regulations. A Personal Property Securities Act is being \nprepared, which will allow moveable assets to be used as credit security, to be approved by the \ncabinet ahead of the December 2011 parliamentary sitting. With limited parliamentary sitting \n(20\u201325 days a year), a clear directive from the cabinet for tabling of a bill in Parliament is \ndemonstrative of government commitment to move forward.  \n \n23.  Output 4: Targeted support for the most vulnerable members of the community. \nThe government is mainstreaming vulnerability issues into its policy considerations, supported \nby subprogram 2. The findings of the 2008 household income and expenditure survey have \nbeen made publicly available and were considered by the cabinet. Key sector plans include \nspecific consideration of the service needs of the vulnerable, and so support the financing of \nimproved services to the most vulnerable. As part of subprogram 2, the identification of the \nvulnerable and understanding of their needs in a policy sense has been improved by cabinet \nconsideration of the poverty report and findings of the household income and expenditure \nsurvey.  During  preparation  of  the  FY2012  budget,  issues  highlighted  by  Samoa\u2019s  second \nprogress report on the Millennium Development Goals and specific papers on vulnerability \nissues (remittances and minimum wage) were considered by the cabinet.  \n \n24.  Under  subprogram 2,  the  government  has  acted  on  its  subprogram 1  commitment, \nimplementing the school free-fees scheme for the 2010 and 2011 school years with the support \nof AusAID and the New Zealand Aid Programme to enable more children to enroll in primary \nschool. The scheme provides a payment for each child enrolled (and additional amounts) to \ngovernment and mission schools at the primary level and removes the requirement for these \nstudents to pay school fees. Other benefits identified as arising from this scheme include an \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2004.

Manila (TA 4417-\nSAM, $150,000, approved 10 October 2004).  \n ", "7 \nincreased level of funds available to support non-salary operation costs in primary schools, \ngreater expenditure control and financial skills given to principals, and increased accuracy of \neducation sector statistics. The government is committed to continuing the scheme.  \n \n25.  Output 5: Consultation and engagement with stakeholders. During the period of \nsubprogram 2, the government will continue to communicate and engage with the private sector \nand civil society on key policy actions. This is being supported through access to a wide range \nof information from government websites. The Trade, Commerce and Industries Development \nCommittee (a policy and coordinating body), which is chaired by the deputy prime minister and \nmeets monthly, is the main formal point of contact between the government and the Samoan \nChamber of Commerce and Industries. Both parties characterize the relationship as good, and \nacknowledged it to be improving. Phase 2 of the PFM reform plan includes completion of a \nformalized communications plan by the end of 2011.  \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n26.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR 6,863,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the program. The loan will \nhave a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan size was determined after consideration of (i) the \nestimated impact of the global economic crisis and the projected deficit financing requirements \nfor the  FY2012  national  budget  estimated  at $47.8 million;  (ii) the  availability  of  additional \nfunding from other development partners in the event the government is unable to meet this \nfinancial requirement; (iii) the significance and complexity of the policy actions of the ERSP, and \nthe budgetary resources and political capital required to implement the program successfully; \nand (iv) the conformity of the ERSP with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (footnote 7). The \ndetermination of loan size took into account the government\u2019s demonstrated commitment to \nimplement a policy agenda, as evidenced by the policy actions achieved from 2009 to date. \n \n27.  Implementation of subprogram 1 has been a positive experience for Samoa (paras. 5\u20136). \nIt has allowed Samoa to increase its capital expenditure as well as further strengthening public \nsector management. More broadly, ADB\u2019s portfolio in Samoa is  performing well and good \nprogress is being made towards targets in the country partnership strategy results framework. \nThe proposed loan size is within the established lending allocation, and is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan.13  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n28.  The program cluster period is from 1 March 2009 to 30 December 2011. Subprogram 2 \nis being implemented from March 2010 to December 2011, with monitoring continuing through \n2012. Subprogram 2 will be provided as a single tranche loan of $10.82 million to be disbursed \nwhen the government has met the conditions for effectiveness, including completion of agreed \nprior policy actions as set forth in the policy matrix.14 \n \n29.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  Samoa  according  to  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement procedures.15 The proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced  and procured in ADB member \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Samoa, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n14  Informal Board seminar was held on 16 October 2009 to discuss program assistance to the following Pacific \ndeveloping member countries: the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga.  \n15 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "8 \ncountries; items in the list of ineligible items16 and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral  sources  are  excluded.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a \ncertificate from the government stipulating that the value of the total imports of Samoa, minus its \nimports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official \ndevelopment assistance, is at least equal to or greater than the amount of the loan to be \ndisbursed during a particular year. Local currency generated from the proceeds of the loan will \nbe used to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n \n30.  The MOF will be the executing agency and will oversee policy, legal, and regulatory \nactions, ensuring that the reforms agreed to by the government and ADB are carried out on time. \nResources from ongoing regional technical assistance will be provided to help the government \nmeet the tranche conditions.17 The MOF will also be responsible for the overall implementation \nof  subprogram 2,  including  all  policy  actions,  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \nmaintenance of all program records. A program coordinating committee (including the MOF and \nthe central bank) was established under subprogram 1 and will be responsible for coordinating \nthis subprogram, as well as any similar programs prepared with development partners.18 The \nprogram coordinating committee will meet at least quarterly to monitor progress and oversee \nimplementation of the program, inviting, as appropriate, line agencies of the borrower, ADB, and \nother development partners to participate in meetings.  \n \n31.  The coordinating committee responsible for monitoring and reporting on implementation \nof subprogram 1 will continue this role through subprogram 2. The committee will (i) within \n3 months of loan effectiveness, establish and maintain a performance evaluation system for the \nprogram, which will be derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and \npolicy matrix; and (ii) monitor and report to ADB, on a biannual basis over the term of the \nprogram, the implementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with \nthe program impact and outcome indicators agreed with the government. As the impact and \noutcome of the program will be most clearly felt beyond the period of its implementation, \nmonitoring will continue to be undertaken by the MOF for at least 12 months. Impact and \noutcome monitoring will maximize use of the government\u2019s own processes to ensure efficiency. \nA completion report will be prepared within 1 year following the end of the program cluster to \nevaluate  its  overall  performance.  ADB  will  also  conduct  a  post-program  review  to  assess \nprogress against the medium-term indicators of the design and monitoring framework and the \nmedium-term program direction of the policy matrix. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n32.  The Samoan economy was one of the more severely affected in the Pacific by the global \neconomic crisis (para. 3). The economy is rebuilding slowly, with a contraction of just 0.2% in \nFY2010. Medium-term growth prospects are sound, with the tourism industry being a key driver \nof growth; manufacturing and agriculture also hold potential for greater growth. In all these \nsectors, economic growth prospects rest on the private sector which, although small, is active \nand holds potential for job growth. Reforms have improved the quality of PFM since 2009, \nguided by PEFA assessments.19 The MTEF provides a plan for economic recovery and growth. \n                                                \n16  List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n18 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management; Economic and Fiscal Analysis (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nThrough  the  increased  pace  of  fiscal  consolidation  set  out  in  the  FY2012  budget,  the \ngovernment is prioritizing macroeconomic stability.  \n \nB.  Governance \n33.  Samoa is considered to have performed well above the Pacific average in regard to \ngovernance. Samoa has made incremental improvements to governance across a range of \nareas, and has exemplified political stability and rule of law. Regulatory quality and government \neffectiveness have been the weaker areas, but actions to revise business legislation, improve \nregulation, and reform SOEs can be expected to show improvements.  \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan agreement. These measures will complement the actions under way to improve financial \naccountability and anticorruption measures, which are being put in place by the government \nwith the support of its development partners.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n35.  The program will help the government reduce poverty incidence and improve long-term \ngrowth prospects. Policy reforms supported by the program are expected to have significant \npoverty  and  social  benefits,  including  indirect  impact  to  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment. The continuation of efforts to rebuild following the tsunami will be supported \nunder output 1, thus addressing the needs of the vulnerable group of tsunami victims. Improved \nPFM will allow the government to dedicate more resources to pro-poor expenditures and to \npromote  more  efficient  service  delivery.  The  cabinet\u2019s  consideration  of  the  findings  of  the \nhousehold  income  and  expenditure  survey,  poverty  assessment,  and  progress  toward  the \nMillennium Development Goals demonstrates this commitment. Benefits will be accrued in the \nshort term  through  the  facilitation  of  the  government\u2019s  planned  budgetary  expenditure,  in \nparticular  on  social  services,  and  in  the  medium-to-long term  both  through  an  improved \nunderstanding within the government of poverty issues, and through implementation of reforms \nto SOEs, which are expected to improve services (output 3). Given existing gender gaps, \nimproved social services are expected to particularly benefit women.20 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n36.  The program is classified category C, with no significant adverse environmental impacts \nidentified. No involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are outlined in Table 2 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.21 The potential benefits from reducing the impact of \nthe  global  economic  crisis  and  providing  for  post-tsunami  reconstruction  with  supporting \nstructural and governance initiatives are considered to outweigh the risks. Indeed, the costs of \ninaction could be substantial\u2014a continued decline in the fiscal situation, with resultant damage \nto the operations of the private sector and implications for the government\u2019s ability to fund basic \nsocial services and address environmental concerns.  \n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "10 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInsufficient government capacity to implement the  Technical assistance from development partners will support \nprogram  program elements. \nReduced funding for capital expenditure   Explicit cabinet commitments will drive the allocation of \nfinancial and human resources.  \nImplementation of the medium-term fiscal framework  The government is prepared to secure external concessional \nfails because of a shortfall in external financing  financing and there are financiers willing to invest. \nPolitical and community support for policy actions  Community awareness of the program will be reinforced \nthrough the communications and engagement strategy. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n38.  The government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of the  program cluster  and \nsubprogram 2  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the loan documents. \n \n39.  Specific assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the government and the \nMOF have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i) the government will (a) maintain the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of \nthe loan agreement for subprogram 2, as described in the development policy letter and the \npolicy matrix, for the duration of the ERSP and subsequently, (b) promptly adopt the other \npolicies and the other actions as specified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, \nand (c) ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the ERSP and \nsubsequently; and (ii) the government and the program implementing agencies will ensure that \nthroughout the implementation of subprogram 2, adequate budgetary allocations of the required \ncounterpart funds are made, approved, and released in a timely manner to support program \nimplementation. \n \n40.  Condition  for  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  will  become  effective  only  after  the \ngovernment has satisfactorily fulfilled all conditions for the release of the single tranche of \nsubprogram 2. Gazettal of the Electricity Act 2010 and cabinet consideration of the personal \nproperty securities bill are outstanding, but are expected to be completed by November 2011.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION   \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR6,863,000 to the Independent State of Samoa for subprogram 2 of \nthe  Economic  Recovery  Support  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n13 October 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nAchievement  of  Real GDP growth progressively  National accounts,  Global economy begins \na  higher  and  accelerates toward the  government finance  to recover from the \nmore  inclusive  government\u2019s target long-term  statistics  downturn \neconomic growth  growth rate of 3.5% per annum by     \npath  2014  Household surveys,  Private sector responds \n    population census,  to improved economic \nRelative standard of living of the  and other statistical  conditions \nmost vulnerable groups of the  releases   \ncommunity, disaggregated by sex,    Risks \nimproved as measured by a rising  Monitoring reports  Cyclones or other \nexpenditure share of the poorest  for the SDS and  weather events damage \nquintile of households between  supporting sector  the economy \n2008 and the next household  plans and strategies   \nincome and expenditure survey  Higher crude oil prices \ndamage the economy \nOutcome      Assumption \nEconomic  Real GDP growth in FY2012  National accounts,  Continued commitment \nrecovery    government finance  of government agencies \ncombined with    statistics  to improve performance \nprotection of the       \nmost vulnerable  Budget deficit on track to decline  Budget papers  Risks \nand the fiscal  below 3.5% of GDP in FY2015    Parliamentary and \nposition      community support for \nPublic sector assessed by IMF  IMF Article IV staff  the government\u2019s \nArticle IV report as at moderate risk  reports  economic management \nof debt distress (or better) in    and policy actions \nFY2012    weakens \n     \nReplacement of SDS 2008\u20132012  Monitoring reports  Implementation of the \nplaces additional emphasis on  for the SDS and  medium-term fiscal \nmeeting the needs of the most  supporting sector  framework fails \nvulnerable members of the  plans and strategies  because of a shortfall in \ncommunity (with special emphasis  external financing \non the needs of disadvantaged   \nwomen)  Funding to capital \nexpenditure is reduced \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
