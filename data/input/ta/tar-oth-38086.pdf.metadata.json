Poverty is not always simply the result of a lack of resources; it can equally be the result \nof the lack of effective access to existing resources, services, and opportunities, or of a lack of \nprotection against harmful or illegal practices. Both access and protection often directly or \nindirectly require proof of legal identity and age. In many developing member countries (DMCs) \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB), proof of identity is lacking for significant portions of the \npopulation due to the absence of an inclusive and effective birth registration system, as part of \neither overall vital records or a civic registration system.  \n \n2.  Information within ADB on this issue has so far been gathered in an ad hoc manner. \nThere is a need for a more systematic analysis. The technical assistance (TA) was endorsed for \nfunding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in January 2004. Fact-Finding Missions to \nBangladesh, Cambodia, and Nepal were undertaken in April and May 2004. The TA supports \nthe overall ADB strategy of eliminating poverty by improving the understanding of the nexus \nbetween the absence of birth registration and poverty, and by identifying ways to facilitate \naccess to existing resources, services, and opportunities as well as to protection. The TA will \nseek to support the elimination of inequalities in legal status and entitlements derived from legal \nidentity  issues  by  (i)  identifying  barriers  to  establishing  legal  identity  and  recommending \nmethods for their removal, and (ii) pilot-testing methods to promote the establishment of legal \nidentity. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3  The right to a legal identity forms the basis for recognition by the State that an individual \nexists as a citizen, and thus, has the right to services, resources, opportunities, and protection \noffered by the State to its citizens. Legal identity is generally established at birth, through either \na formal or informal registration system. Articles 7 and 8 of the Convention of the Rights of the \nChild (ratified by all DMCs) recognize the right to be registered immediately after birth, as well \nas rights to a name, identity, and nationality. Proof of legal identity is often intimately linked with \nthe exercise of rights and opportunities. For example, proof of legal identity may be required for \neducation (directly or indirecty through, e.g., access to scholarships, participation in exams, or \nbuying textbooks), health services such as immunization, formal employment in the private and \npublic sectors, financial services, social security, access to justice and legal aid, property rights, \nparticipation in decision-making processes (e.g., voting), marriage rights and citizenship rights, \nand migration.   \n \n4.  In addition to furthering individual rights, proof of legal identity meets important social  \nand collective needs. Accurate birth registration provides essential statistics for governmental \nbudgeting and planning of social services, e.g., health and education programs, and housing \nand labor market policies. Proof of legal identity may be used to assert the collective rights of \nminorities and other vulnerable groups who may not be fully accounted for within a society. Birth \nregistration  and  certificates  are  important  assets  to  prove  the  size  of  affected  minority \npopulations.  Recognition of existence is the first step in asserting rights for full social inclusion.  \n \n5.  Reliable birth records are also essential to prevent harmful or illegal practices such as \nchild labor, child marriage, child prostitution, and trafficking of women and children. In addition, \nbirth registration is linked to nationality and, thus, also to consular assistance, which is important \nfor migrant workers.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 May 2004.  \n ", "2    \n \n6.  The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that, globally, 50 million births \nare not registered each year. In the South Asia region, an estimated 63% of annual births are \nunregistered. In the East Asia and Pacific regions, 22% of annual births are not registered. \nRegistration of births is lower in rural areas than in urban areas, lower for girls than for boys, \nand lower for some minority groups. The reasons for low rates of birth registration by family \nmembers are varied: (i) limited public awareness of the importance of birth registration; (ii) \nfinancial, geographic, or other de facto barriers; (iii) complicated registration procedures and \ninadequate support; (iv) rent-seeking by some officials involved in the registration procedure; (v) \nfears that registration will be used as a means of tagging or monitoring people; (vi) avoiding \ndetection  of  noncompliance  with  governmental  family  planning  regulations;  and  (vii) \ndiscriminatory practices in who can register a child. Civic or health officials may not register \nbirths in order to deny the existence of certain population segments and maintain the status quo \nin gender, religion, ethnicity, or caste.  \n \n7.  Access issues resulting from the inability to prove legal identity may be addressed in a \nnumber of ways. The necessity of birth registration requirements may be reexamined across the \nspectrum of services in DMCs, as well as in ADB-financed projects. For example, proof of legal \nidentity may not be necessary to attain basic health services, such as immunization or primary \nschool enrollment; mere physical presence may be sufficient.  Where birth records do not, or no \nlonger,  exist,  alternative  methods  of  establishing  legal  identity  must  be  identified  and \nrecognized. People may be identified through existing social or religious records, including \nvoting  records,  census  records,  or  marriage  records.  Identifying  alternative  methods  of \nestablishing legal identity may be necessary until an inclusive and effective birth registration \nsystem is established in affected DMCs. Physical and other barriers to birth registration may be \nremoved and the establishment and effective operation of vital registration systems may be \nsupported. \n \n8.  Addressing legal identity issues through registration may raise privacy concerns, fears of \nidentification for targeting violence, or concerns that proof of legal identity may be used to \nfurther discrimination or disenfranchisement. Equally, concerns have been raised that too easy \nregistration  encourages  illegal  immigration  into  cross-border  areas.  Therefore,  attempts  to \naddress the issue must be sensitive to these concerns and result from participatory dialogue \nwith intended beneficiaries, stakeholders, and other development partners. \n \n9.  The TA will identify legal identity issues and solutions in three DMCs: Bangladesh, \nCambodia, and Nepal. The participating DMCs have been selected on the basis of statistics \nindicating limited birth registration, as well as of the spectrum of identity issues represented.  \nThe enhanced understanding of legal identity issues from the TA  may be applicable in other \naffected DMCs. \n \n10.  In Bangladesh, it is estimated that only 3\u20137% of annual births are registered. The current \nBirth and Death Registration Act dates from 1873, and was amended in 1983. A new Birth and \nDeath Registration Bill is expected during 2004. Once the bill is enacted, birth registration will be \na prerequisite for, among others, (i) enrollment in primary education; (ii) obtaining a driver\u2019s \nlicense, marriage certificate, and passport; (ii) formal employment and sitting for Public Service \nCommission exams; (iii) opening a bank account; (iv) transferring property; and (iv) exercise of \ncitizenship and voting rights. Challenges to the Bangladeshi registration system include (i) lack \nof a comprehensive strategy on how the administration will deal with the increased demand for \nbirth registration following the coming into effect of the new law; (ii) low level of awareness; (iii) \nlimited training and capacity of registrars and other officials; (iv) insufficient equipment and ", "      3 \nmaterials; (v) unclear division of tasks and responsibilities and inadequate cooperation and \ncoordination among government agencies; and (vi) insufficient monitoring and evaluation of the \nregistration process. \n \n11.  In Cambodia, birth registration for about 5% of the population is under the existing Sub-\nDecree on Civil Registration of 2001. Other records, such as family books and resident books, \nexist, but there is no clear linkage between the different systems. The new Civil Code is \nexpected to make birth registration mandatory. Birth registration in Cambodia is linked, for \nexample, to school enrollment, citizenship and political rights, landownership, marriage rights, \nformal employment, and access to justice and State protection. Challenges facing Cambodian \nbirth registration include (i) lack of automation of the system; (ii) decaying older paper records; \n(iii) lack of linkage between birth-registration and other records; (iv) insufficient equipment, \nresources, and training at local level; (v) low public awareness combined with a high level of \nhesitance  to  register;  and  (vi  overly  complicated  procedures  and  rent-seeking  by  officials.  \nUnder the ADB-funded Community Council Development Project (Loan 1953)2, substantial work \nhas already begun, including the establishment of mobile registration teams in six communes \nsince March 2004. The TA will complement the ongoing Project, in particular by clarifying the \nlegal framework for registration. \n \n12.  In Nepal, UNICEF estimates that 35% of annual births are registered. However, the \nactual births registered may be only 15-20%, based on the information sheets completed under \nthe Vital Records Act since its enactment in 1976. Birth registration is part of an overall family \nregistration system. In some districts in the mountain and hill regions, almost no families are \nregistered. Challenges facing the Nepalese registration system include (i)  insufficient basic \nequipment, materials, and training; (ii) decaying older paper records; (iii) contradictory and \noutdated  legislation;  (iv)  until  recently,  limited  governmental  awareness  of  and  importance \nascribed to the issue; (v) discriminatory registration procedures and practices; (vi) physical \nbarriers posed by the topography; and (vii) fee structures that discourage registration.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The purpose of the TA is to increase the understanding and awareness of the nexus \nbetween legal identity and poverty and to increase the capacity of DMCs and ADB to (i) identify \nkey barriers to establishing legal identity, and (ii) carry out effective measures to eliminate such \nbarriers. The development goal of the TA is to support the elimination of inequalities in legal \nstatus and entitlements as well as protection derived from such status. \n \n14.   The TA will have four major outputs: (i) a comprehensive survey in each participating \nDMC of the requirements for establishing legal identity, and the direct and indirect legal identity \nrequirements for participation in fundamental social, economic, and political activities, including \nan analysis of legal requirements as well as practicalities that impede access; (ii) identification \nof  practical  solutions,  best  practices  from  other  existing  registration  models,  as  well  as \nappropriate law and policy reform dialogue to address legal identity issues in participating DMCs \nin  the  short,  medium,  and  long  term;  (iii)  awareness-raising  and  training  of  ADB  lawyers, \nmission  leaders,  and  other  relevant  staff,  as well  as  stakeholders in  the  countries  on  the \nimportance of legal identity issues and solutions; and (iv) identification of projects and programs \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2002.

Based on the TA\u2019s outcomes, mid- to long-term results may include  (i) law and policy \nreform; (ii) awareness-raising dialogue; (iii) birth registration components or activities in ADB-\nfinanced projects and programs; (iv) covenants in loan agreements, which mitigate the absence \nof birth records for intended project beneficiaries; (v) improved statistical data collection to \nfacilitate  government  planning  and  budgeting;  or  (vi)  lending  to  remove  barriers  to  birth \nregistration or to provide registration equipment or training. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  Key activities are (i) a literature survey of issues relating to establishment of legal identity \nand registration methods, (ii) at least one workshop per DMC to solicit views from stakeholders \nas well as collection of data in the field, (iii) one workshop per DMC to discuss the findings, (iv) \none regional workshop, (v) training of relevant ADB staff to identify legal identity issues in \nprojects, (vi) pilot testing of registration methods, and (vii) publication of the results.  \n \n17.  Training of ADB staff will involve two or three workshops to be held in ADB for relevant \nstaff, including lawyers of ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel (OGC), on the findings of the TA \nand ways to incorporate them in the upcoming pipeline of projects and programs. The TA \nfindings will be included in a tool kit for ADB lawyers and other staff members when reviewing \nADB-proposed projects and programs to ensure that the target groups for such funding are not \nprevented from benefiting due to a failure to assert their legal identity because of the absence of \na birth record. The TA findings will further be disseminated through the ADB web site and \nthrough an OGC Law and Policy Reform publication.  \n \n18.  The pilot-testing phase will seek to test alternative registration methods. In light of the \nimportance of establishing legal identity at birth, the TA will focus largely on issues related to \nbirth registration. However, alternative systems of establishing legal identity may be identified as \nshort-term solutions to access or other concerns. Where applicable, birth registration will be \nconsidered  in  the  context  of  overall  vital  registration.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  TA  will \nsynchronize activities with ongoing ADB-financed loans, especially in the area of governance \nreforms, rural development, and social sectors to pilot-test the synergetic effects.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $575,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, to be administered by ADB.  Detailed \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB,  through  OGC  together  with  gender  and  governance  specialists  in  resident \nmissions,  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nmanagement and monitoring of the TA activities. Pilot testing will be in cooperation with the \nrelevant  ADB  regional  department.  The  following  will  be  the  counterpart  agencies  in  the \nparticipating DMC\u2019s: Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural \nDevelopment and Cooperatives in Bangladesh; Ministry of Interior in Cambodia; and Ministry of \nLocal Development in Nepal. \n ", "      5 \n21.  It is estimated that up to 32 person-months of consulting services will be required, of \nwhich 8 will be performed by international consultants and 24 by domestic consultants. The \ndomestic consultants and an international consultant for 6 person-months will be recruited from \na consulting firm for overall TA implementation. This international consultant, who will serve as \nteam leader, will have a strong background and experience in law, social inclusion, and a rights-\nbased approach to development. The domestic consultants (person-months are in parenthesis) \nin each participating DMC will be (i) a population registration and statistics specialist (2), (ii) a \nvulnerable groups and social development specialist (3), and (iii) a legal and institutional expert \n(3). These consultants will be recruited through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. In addition, an individual international consultant may be recruited for up to 2 \nmonths toward the end of the TA to review all the inputs and assist OGC in producing a \npublication and tool kit. Consultants will work closely with gender and governance specialists in \nthe resident missions of the participating DMCs and designated government counterparts. The \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, starting in October 2004 and ending in \nDecember 2005. The consultants will submit inception, progress, draft final, and final reports. \nThe outline of the final report is in Appendix 4. The consultants will organize (i) one workshop \nfor each country to solicit views from stakeholders, (ii) one workshop for each country to discuss \nthe findings, (iii) one regional workshop to discuss the draft final report, and (iv) 2-3 workshops \nto be held in ADB to discuss the findings with ADB lawyers and relevant staff. For pilot-testing \nthe  registration  technique,  four  computer  sets  will  be  provided.  The  sets  will  become  the \nproperty of the executing agency of the DMC where pilot-testing takes place at the end of the \nTA.  \n \n23. The reporting requirements for the consultants are as follows: (i) an inception report, within 4 \nweeks of TA commencement; (ii) individual country reports including summaries of proceedings \nof national workshops; (iv) a draft final report, at least 1 month before the regional workshop; \nand (v) a final report summarizing the outputs with appropriately documented listing of the \nachievements. \n \nIV.

Consultants Recruited as Firm \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will recruit a firm or institution to provide 6 person-\nmonths  international  consulting  and  24  person-months  domestic  consulting  services.  The \ndomestic services will last for 8 months for each of the participating countries - Bangladesh, \nCambodia, and Nepal. \n2.  The international consultant, designated as team leader, will have a strong background \nand experience in law, social inclusion, a rights-based approach to development and poverty \nreduction  in  ADB\u2019s  region,  and  preferably  have  working  experience  in  at least  two  of  the \nparticipating countries. The consultant should have a good knowledge and understanding of \nsocial inclusion issues in each of the participating countries as well as of the ground realities in \nthose countries. The consultant should have demonstrated outstanding ability to organize and \nfacilitate regional workshops and superior analytical and writing skills. Familiarity with ADB \nprojects and technical assistance (TA) will be an advantage.  \n 3.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  combined  experience  in  population  registration \nsystems and statistics, vulnerable groups and social development, and legal and institutional \nmatters. They will work as a team. Experience and willingness to discuss such experience will \nbe  important.  Multidisciplinary  and  thorough  understanding  of  the  ground  realities  in  their \nrespective  countries,  including  sensitivity  to  political  realities  and  issues  related  to \ndecentralization, will be essential. A willingness to go to the field is mandatory. Experience in \norganizing and facilitating workshops will be an asset.
