Transmission services to delinquent states will be suspended but\nstates that have implemented power sector reform programs will receive\npreference for investment under the proposed loan. The proposed Project\nwill provide strong transmission networks to create flexibility to switch the\npower supply from delinquent or nonreforming states to states that have\ngood payment records and have implemented or will implement sector\nreform.  The  sector  loan  modality  is  being  adopted,  which  provides\nflexibility in choosing subprojects that  meet the criteria agreed upon by\nPowergrid and  the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nObjectives and\nScope The Project comprises two components: part A: upgrading and expansion\nof 400 kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, and 132 kV transmission systems to transfer\nadditional  power,  to  improve  system  reliability,  and  to  enhance  the\nefficient utilization of power plants; and part B: establishing 400 kV and\n220 kV transmission systems to evacuate the power generated by the\npower  stations  of  the  central  power  utilities  and  independent  power\nproducers.\nThe  Project\u2019s  strategic  objectives  are  to  (i)  enhance  private  sector\nparticipation in the power sector; (ii) strengthen the newly established\nregulatory mechanisms by pricing bulk supply and power transmission on\na sound economic basis; and (iii) enhance the autonomy of Powergrid by\nassisting its transition from Government-guaranteed programs and funds\nto market-based ones. The Project also facilitates the reform of the power", "ii\nsector at the state level by allowing investments that benefit only those\nstates with records of good payment to Powergrid.\nCost Estimates The Project is estimated to cost $491.5 million, equivalent comprising\nincluding  $394.2  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $97.3  million\nequivalent in local currency costs.\n($ million)\nFinancing Plan Source Foreign Local Total %\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB Loan 250.0 0.0 250.0 51\nInternational\nCommercial 120.0 0.0 120.0 25\nCofinancing\nDomestic Borrowing 0.0 16.3 16.3 3\nPowergrid 24.2 81.0 105.2 21\nTotal Project Cost 394.2 97.3 491.5 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank;  Powergrid = Power Grid Corporation of India Limited\nLoan Amount\nAnd Terms $250  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  repayable  over\n20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. Interest will be at ADB\u2019s\npool-based variable lending rate for US dollar loans. Powergrid will bear\nthe foreign exchange risk.\nCommercial\nCofinancing and\nPartial Credit\nGuarantee ADB  will  provide  a  partial  credit  guarantee  to  support  a  15-year,\n$120 million  syndicated  loan  (the  Cofinancing  Loan)  from  commercial\nsources. The partial credit guarantee will cover principal and interest due\nfrom years 8 through 15 of the cofinancing Loan for the ADB Loan and April\n2001 to March 2005 for the cofinancing Loan.\nPeriod of\nUtilization November 2000  to March 2006\nExecuting\nAgency Power Grid Corporation of India Limited\nImplementation\nArrangements This is a sector project comprising many subprojects. Powergrid will be\nresponsible  for  planning,  designing,  contracting,  testing,  and\ncommissioning  the  subprojects.  For  each  subproject,  Powergrid  will\nsubmit a subproject appraisal report to ADB for approval. Powergrid will\nalso provide ADB with quarterly progress reports for project monitoring.\nProcurement All ADB-financed equipment and materials for the Project will be procured\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  To  accelerate\nimplementation  of  the  Project,  Powergrid  has  been  allowed  advance\nprocurement action for eligible subprojects. Retroactive financing has not\nbeen allowed.", "iii\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date September 2005.\nProject Benefits\nand\nBeneficiaries The Project will (i) provide additional and more reliable power supply to all\ncategories  of  customers;  (ii)  allow  interchange  of  power  between\nelectricity regions in a more flexible and economic manner, with less\nenvironmental impact; (iii) permit a decrease in costs of electricity through\neconomic  load  dispatch;  (iv)  aid  in  the  development  of  a  regulatory\nframework  for  operating  the  national  grid  transmission  system;  and\n(v) facilitate state-level power sector reform. The Project will benefit all\nclasses of consumers who are currently affected by load restrictions, load\nshedding, and power quality.", "1\nI .  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i)  a proposed\nloan to Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (Powergrid), guaranteed by India, for the Power\nTransmission Improvement (Sector) Project; and (ii) a proposed partial credit guarantee by the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  of  an  international  commercial  cofinancing  to  Powergrid,\ncounter-guaranteed by India, intended to cofinance the Project.\nI.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The Indian power sector is currently undergoing reforms at both the central (federal)\nand state (provincial) levels. The reforms continue to be supported by ADB at both levels and\nare  now  approaching  self-sustainability  at  the  central  level  where  Powergrid  is  playing  an\nimportant role in initiating and accelerating the reform process through increasing competition in\nthe  sector  and  through  greater  commercialization.  Powergrid\u2019s  investments  are,  therefore,\naccorded priority by the Government of India. This loan will be ADB\u2019s second loan in support of\nPowergrid\u2019s  operations.  For  India,  this  will  be  the  first  time  that  international  commercial\ncofinancing is raised using ADB's partial credit guarantee after approval of the ADB's new\nGuarantee Policy in 1995.  Loan fact-finding was carried out during 11-22 May 1998 and\nappraisal from 7 to 19 September 1998.1\n3. Powergrid\u2019s investment program is well conceived and meets the priority needs of the\nnational economy.  Powergrid\u2019s competence as an executing agency has been demonstrated by\nthe successful implementation of the ongoing loan 2, including its policy issues. A sector loan is\ntherefore considered appropriate to finance a portion of Powergrid\u2019s investments over the next\nfive years.  Through the sector loan approach, ADB can support Powergrid to improve power\nsystem performance, facilitate further sector reform in central sector agencies, as well as cause\nstates to accelerate their power sector reforms. A sector loan approach will internalize the\nprocess of choosing subprojects that meet technical, financial, economic, environmental, and\nsocial criteria appropriate to modernizing the sector. The sector loan approach will also provide\nPowergrid with sufficient flexibility to optimally utilize the commercial cofinancing raised using\nADB\u2019s partial credit guarantee facility. Appendix 1 gives the project framework.\nII.  BACKGROUND\n4. India\u2019s economy has grown by about  6 percent annually over the last five years. While it\nis important for India to adopt a macroeconomic framework conducive to ensuring sustainable\ngrowth, the Government needs to pay equal attention to removing infrastructure deficiencies\nthat present severe bottlenecks in the continued expansion of the economy. Estimates indicate\nthat the level of investment in infrastructure needs to be increased by almost 50 percent in real\n                                                \n1  The Mission comprised H.

In January 2000, the appraisal  was\nupdated by a mission comprising S. Chander, Senior Project Engineer/ Mission Leader, K. Moktan, Senior\nFinancial Analyst, D. Graczyk, Project Economist and M. Hamano, Project Engineer.\n2  Loan 1405-IND: Power Transmission (Sector) Project, for $275 million, approved on 16 November 1995. The loan\ncloses on 31 March 2001.", "2\nterms during the next decade if India is to maintain a target annual growth of at least 7 percent,\nwhich is necessary for significantly reducing the incidence of poverty.\n5. Electricity  is  one  of  the  key  inputs  for  India\u2019s  overall  socioeconomic  development,\nespecially in commercial and industrial activities, and has strong linkage to other infrastructure\nsuch as transportation and telecommunications. Basic human needs such as water supply and\nsewerage, and many social welfare activities such as education and health care, are also\ndirectly or indirectly supported by electricity supply. Although India\u2019s power sector has expanded\nrapidly, continuous power shortages, combined with poor quality of supply, severely constrain\neconomic development in almost all parts of the country.\n6. The development of the power sector is currently limited by two major factors: public\nsector funding constraints, and the absence of the required long-term policy and regulatory\nframework for enhanced private investment in the sector. Public sector funding constraints are\ndirectly linked to the broader issue of the system of subsidies in the Indian economy. In fiscal\nyear  (FY)1999,  total  budgetary  subsidies  at  the  central  and  state  levels  amounted  to\nRs557.26 billion ($12.8 billion), or over 3.1 percent of India's gross domestic product.\n7. Of these subsidies, Rs225.37 billion ($5.18 billion), or about 40 percent of the total, was\nchanneled to the power sector to compensate the utilities for the lower-than-supply cost tariffs\nfor certain consumers groups. Adjustment of tariffs to achieve higher cost recovery not only is\ncrucial to increase the self-financing position of public sector power entities but has a direct\nbearing on further commercialization and privatization of the power sector. The chronic financial\ndifficulties of most state electricity boards (SEBs) account for much of the sector\u2019s difficulties.\nCollectively, SEBs have a high level of accounts payable to central power agencies that supply\nelectricity to them, threatening the financial viability of these agencies.\n8. The present status of the power sector also reflects attempts to politically manage such\na large and complex system, and the limited autonomy under which many of the power utilities\noperate. Establishing an independent regulatory body at central and state levels is essential to\nensure the commercial and technical soundness of the power sector and the autonomy of\npower sector entities from political interference.\nA.  Power Sector Overview\n1.  Organization\n9. India consists of 25 states and 7 union territories with a total population of over 1 billion.\nIts power sector is the third largest in Asia after that of the People\u2019s Republic of China and\nJapan. Installed generation capacity grew from about 2,000 megawatts (MW) in 1950 to about\n98,000 MW as of 31 March 2000, with an additional 12,000 MW of captive generation capacity.\nThere are more than 77 million electricity consumers and about 86 percent of villages have\nbeen electrified. However, the annual per capita consumption was only about 360 kilowatt-hours\n(kWh)  in  FY2000,  which  is  lower  than  the  consumption  levels  of  many  other  developing\ncountries.\n10. The organization of the power sector is determined by India\u2019s federal structure. The\nGovernment\u2019s Ministry of Power provides overall guidance to the sector, mainly through the\nCentral Electricity Authority (CEA), and owns the central power sector utilities such as the\nNational Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydro-electric Power Corporation\n(NHPC), the Nuclear Power Corporation (NPC), and Powergrid, and financing institutions such", "3\nas  the  Power  Finance  Corporation  (PFC)  and  the  Rural  Electrification  Corporation.  State\ngovernments control the rest of the sector through 17 SEBs and 12 electricity departments\n(EDs). These SEBs and EDs provide distribution facilities and set retail tariffs. Power generation\nand transmission are split between the central power sector agencies and SEBs. The central\nagencies own and operate 32 percent of the country\u2019s total generation, while SEBs and EDs\nhave 64 percent of the total. In addition, five private utilities in urban agglomerations have a\nshare of 4 percent in power generation.\n11. As a result of India\u2019s federal structure, all major issues affecting the power sector require\nconcurrent action by the Government and state governments. Although the structure gives the\nGovernment a say in the affairs of the power sectors of the states, this shared responsibility\nlimits the Government\u2019s ability to influence the power sector policies of state governments,\nespecially with respect to retail tariffs.\n2.  State Electricity Boards\n12. Prior to the reorganization of the power sectors in the states of Orissa (1996), Haryana\n(1998), Andhra Pradesh (1999), Karnataka (1999), and Uttar Pradesh (2000), the power sector\nin every major state was organized through its SEB. Even today, other than in these states,\nSEBs still control the operations of the sector. The Electricity Act of 1910 and the Electricity\nSupply Act of 1948 with their several amendments provide the legal basis for the sector\u2019s\nfunctioning and utilities\u2019 operation. These acts allow considerable managerial and financial\nautonomy to the SEBs, but this autonomy is often nominal as most state governments use\nSEBs to pursue noncommercial objectives, particularly to provide low-priced or free electricity to\nthe agriculture sector. Initially, this cross-subsidization was done to provide low-cost inputs for\nagriculture to stimulate food production and was very successful. However, that stage is now\nwell past but  the practice has continued largely to attract political support. State governments\nalso tend to interfere with SEB\u2019s day-to-day operations, thus complicating the task of SEB\nmanagement. These interventions have led to the SEBs\u2019 deteriorating financial health, which\nhas become the central problem of India\u2019s power sector.\n13. Several years of negative internal cash generation has impoverished the SEBs, impeded\nthe construction of new power facilities, and restricted the funds available for maintenance and\nrehabilitation of existing assets, thus making it impossible to close the demand-supply gap.\nChronic power shortages and poor quality of power supply continue to plague the economy in\nalmost all parts of the country. If not remedied, the unavailability of sufficient power will be the\nsingle most important constraint to economic development in the coming years and will thwart\nthe Government\u2019s efforts to attract domestic and foreign investment.\n14. A reform of the power sector at the state level is urgently needed to reduce the need for\nsubsidies and public spending on the sector. As a result of the state governments' interference\nin  SEB  operation  and  subsidies  to  agriculture  customers,  the  sector\u2019s  losses  in  FY1999\naggregated to Rs63.3 billion ($1.4 billion), but were reduced to Rs45.0 billion ($1.0 billion) by\nsubsidies from state governments. Power sector reform would significantly reduce claims on the\ncountry\u2019s fiscal resources and allow additional spending on other priority sectors such as health\nand education, which are essential for poverty reduction.\n3.  Central Power Utilities\n15. Until  1972,  the  SEBs  were  almost  solely  responsible  for  development  of  power\ngeneration and transmission within their states but were unable to meet the rapidly increasing", "4\ndemand for electricity. To improve the efficiency of generation, three central sector agencies -\nNTPC, NHPC and NPC, were established in 1975 to generate bulk power for sale to SEBs. In\n1989, Powergrid was established as a transmission and dispatch company by amalgamating\nthe transmission and dispatch assets of all central power sector agencies. In addition to these\nwholly  owned  companies,  the  Government  also  has  shares  in  special-purpose  generating\ncompanies such as the Bhakra-Beas Management Board, the Damodar Valley Corporation, the\nTehri Power Corporation, the Nathpa-Jhakhri Power Corporation, the North-East Electric Power\nCorporation, and the Neyveli Lignite Corporation.\n16. The central agencies, including NTPC, NHPC, and Powergrid, are seriously affected by\nthe poor financial health of most SEBs, as was evidenced several times in the past when\nexcessive accounts receivable from the SEBs seriously impaired the central agencies\u2019 financial\nliquidity. To resolve this problem, NTPC has, in addition to restricting supply and obtaining\nGovernment appropriation to settle debts of SEBs, even resorted to taking over the generation\nfacilities of SEBs in settlement of accounts receivable.3\n4. Powergrid\n17. Prior to 1991, NTPC and other central sector generating companies constructed and\noperated the transmission facilities to evacuate power from their power plants and transmit the\npower to client SEBs. As the transmission systems grew, it was recognized that it would be\nmore  efficient  to  have  a  national  transmission  utility  that  would  be  responsible  for  the\ntransmission systems required to evacuate power from the central sector power plants, and\nconstruct and operate the transmission and dispatch facilities required for power interchange\namong SEBs within a region and for interchanges between regions.\n18. To serve that purpose, Powergrid was established in October 1989 as a Government-\nowned corporation and commenced operation in late 1991. It has been profitable since its first\nfull year of commercial operation in FY1993, and is expected to remain so. The development of\nPowergrid was planned in three phases. The first phase, which was completed in 1992, involved\nthe transfer of transmission facilities and associated staff from the other central sector agencies\nto Powergrid. The second phase of development involved taking over from CEA  the operations\nof the regional system coordination centers (RSCCs) and associated communication facilities in\neach region. This was accomplished in 1996.\n19. The third phase, which is ongoing, is the development of a national transmission grid\nand  facilities  for  intensified  interregional  cooperation  and  coordination.  Transmission  links\nbetween the five power regions are very limited, 4 and the different regions are not synchronized\nin frequency. The development of a national grid will enhance operational efficiency by the\nsharing of reserve margins, trading of surplus generation between regions, and long-term power\ntransfer from regions with low-cost hydropower or coal resources. Powergrid will now construct\nand operate new RSCC facilities, which will improve the coordination of regional grids and\nfacilitate bulk power trading between SEBs. Development of additional transmission facilities for\n                                                \n3  As part of the agreement to change the executing agency for Loan 907-IND Unchahar Thermal Power Project for\n$160.0 million approved on 29September 1988 to NTPC, ADB, the Government, the Government of Uttar Pradesh,\nand NTPC agreed to transfer title to the 420-MW Stage-I to NTPC. NTPC has since taken over the Talcher\nThermal Power Station from Orissa SEB, and the Tanda Thermal Power Station from Uttar Pradesh SEB.\n4  Transmission links between regions are set up by high voltage direct current (HVDC) back-to-back connections or\nradial alternating current connections with isolated systems, because of lack of frequency control and power flow\ncontrol schemes.", "5\nnew central sector power stations and for power trading between SEBs within a region will also\ncontinue.\n20. As on 31 March 2000, Powergrid owned and operated 28,985 circuit kilometers (cct-km)\nof 800 kV and 400 kV transmission lines, 1,630 cct-km of 500 kV high voltage direct current\n(HVDC) transmission lines, 8,402 cct-km of 220 kV and 132 kV transmission lines, 3 HVDC\nback-to back links, 5 load dispatch centers, and 65 extra high voltage substations with a total\ntransformation  capacity  of  31,655  megavolt-amperes  (MVA),  making  it  one  of  the  largest\ntransmission systems companies in the world.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n1.  Overall Power Sector Reform\n21. Despite the rapid expansion of the Indian power system over the last 50 years, power\nshortage is currently estimated to be about 11.3 percent of peak load and 8.3 percent of energy\nsupply on an all India basis, although this varies considerably from region to region. Electricity\ndemand is expected to grow rapidly. The planned capacity addition during 1997 to 2002 is about\n40,000 MW, although it is expected that only about 25,000 MW of additional capacity would\nactually be realized. About $5 billion in investment will be necessary to transmit output power of\nsuch large-scale additional generating capacity with adequate reliability and quality. Powergrid\nas  the  central  agency  responsible  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  main  bulk\ntransmission network has planned substantial investments during the next five years for system\nexpansion and strengthening (Appendix 2).\n22. In October 1994, the National Development Council,5 (NDC) submitted a key policy\nreport on power sector reform which recommended: (i) organizational reforms at the state level,\nconsisting of commercialization and unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution;\n(ii) organizational reforms at the regional and national levels aimed at strengthening the role of\nthe  central  sector  agencies,  freeing  them  from  governmental  control,  allowing  them  to\nimplement new projects on a joint-venture basis with the private sector, ultimately reducing\nGovernment\u2019s equity in them to not more than 26 percent; (iii) large-scale involvement of the\nprivate sector in generation and distribution, with the sponsors selected through transparent and\ncompetitive bidding procedures; (iv) depoliticizing electricity tariff setting by creating a national\ntariff board for regulating bulk and transmission tariffs at the national level and regional tariff\nboards for regulating bulk and retail tariffs for both public and private utilities at the state level;\nand (v) progressive phasing out of subsidies to agriculture consumers, with a minimum tariff of\nnot less than 50 percent of the average cost of supply. These recommendations, especially the\nissues related to the autonomy, regulation and tariff setting in central sector agencies, were\nlargely the result of sustained policy dialogue by ADB and the World Bank, and ADB\u2019s technical\nassistance 6 (TA).\n23. These recommendations have been confirmed in meetings of the power ministers of the\nGovernment and the states in October and December 1996 as the \u201cCommon Minimum National\nAction Plan for Power.\u201d Key elements of the plan include; (i) establishing state regulatory\ncommissions; (ii) rationalizing tariffs to ensure that each consumer category provides at least\n50 percent  cost  recovery;  (iii)  agriculture  tariffs  be  set  at  Rs  0.50/  kWh    ($  0.015/  kWh)\n                                                \n5  NDC is India\u2019s highest political body. It is chaired by the prime minister and comprises the Chief Ministers of all\nstates in India.\n6  TA 1756-IND: Study of Bulk Supply and Transmission Tariffs and Transmission Regulation, for $600,000 approved\non 29 September 1992, completed in February 1994.", "6\nimmediately and achieve 50 percent cost recovery within three years: and (iv) enhanced private\nsector participation.\n24. In line with the above policy, the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act 1998 (ERC Act)\nwas approved by the Indian Parliament on 2 July 1998. Thereafter, on 24 July 1998, the\nGovernment appointed the members of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission  (CERC),\nwhich was established through the ERC Act. Under the ERC Act, the CERC has full authority to\nregulate central power utilities and set bulk tariffs. The ERC Act also urges state governments to\nestablish  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions  (SERCs)  with  full  authority  on  state-level\npower utilities. Since power sector reform at the state level varies, a uniform approach in\nestablishing the SERCs is necessary because of increasing interstate/regional power exchange\ndue  to  large-scale  generation  projects  by  central  power  utilities  and  independent  power\nproducers. The ERC Act, therefore, provides strong legislative support for power sector reform\nat the state level through CERC\u2019s guidelines on bulk power tariffs and establishment of model\nSERCs. The passage of the ERC Act is a milestone action of the Government toward sector\nreform. On 28 July 1998, the Indian Parliament approved the amendment to the Electricity\n(Supply) Act, 1948 to allow private sector participation in the transmission subsector. With the\npassage of this amendment, all subsectors of the power sector were opened to private sector\nparticipation.\n25.   Good  governance  at  both  the  macro-sector  and  the  corporate  levels  is  being\nemphasized in the reform process. At the sector level, governance is sought to be improved\nthrough  predictability  (long-term  planning,  codification  and  simplification  of  rules  and\nregulations,  and  predictable  policies  on  tariffs),  transparency  (systematic  dissemination  of\nrelevant sector information, independent regulatory commissions, public hearings on issues\nbefore  they  are  decided),  and  accountability    (cause-effect  structure  of  incentives).  At  the\ncorporate level, governance is being enhanced through corporatization, independence of the\nboards of directors from the Government, defined delegation of powers to staff, computerized\nmanagement information systems, and commercialization of activities.\n2.  Sector Reform at State Level\n26. On account of their high technical and nontechnical losses, as well as the low tariffs set\nfor  agriculture  consumers,  all  SEBs  lack  the  necessary  investment  funds  to  undertake\nexpansion, renovation, and modernization programs. Weak financial and commercial viability of\nSEBs is also inhibiting private entrepreneurs from participating in the entire power sector from\ngeneration through transmission to distribution. Therefore, the most critical part of sector reform\nis at the state level. State governments must resolve three major issues: (i) the tariff structure\nneeds to be revised to reflect the cost of supply based on metered energy; (ii) subsidies to\nspecific customer categories should be provided explicitly through institutional measures such\nas the state budget;  and (iii) autonomy and accountability need to be delegated to the electric\nutility business on a commercial basis. In principle, the Government and state governments\nhave agreed that these issues can be resolved by (i) the unbundling of the SEB\u2019s activities into\ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  and  vesting  these  functional  responsibilities  with\ndifferent entities; (ii) corporatization of the new successor entities; (iii) establishment of an\nindependent body to regulate sector issues such as tariff setting; and (iv) facilitation of private\nsector participation in generation and; if viable and justified, in distribution and transmission.\n27. In line with the above framework, several state governments have undertaken studies on\npower sector reform in association with aid agencies such as ADB, World Bank, Department for\nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Canadian  International", "7\nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), and the United States Agency for International Development\n(USAID). Orissa State is the first state to commission such studies and implement reforms.\nSeveral other states (Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya\nPradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal) have also initiated reforms\nand/or studies for reforms.\n28. ADB is supporting reforms in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Four TAs7 supporting the\nreforms in Gujarat have been implemented and one in Madhya Pradesh. CIDA, is supporting\nADB\u2019s effort in Madhya Pradesh and is funding two of the studies. In addition, CIDA has, on its\nown,  also assisted the state of Kerala, which has been designated as the third focal state for\nADB\u2019s assistance, in carrying out comprehensive studies for power sector reform.\n29. In addition to its support for power sector reforms in the three focal states of Gujarat,\nMadhya Pradesh, and Kerala, ADB and USAID have accorded TA for supporting PFC 8. The TA\nwill conduct studies to aid the restructuring of the power sector in the states of Assam, Punjab,\nand West Bengal.\n3.  Private Sector Participation\n30. During  the  period  1991-1994,  the  Government  formulated  policies  to  attract  private\nsector  investments  mainly  in  power  generation  by  offering  attractive  returns  on  private\ninvestments  through  measures  such  as  a  guaranteed  rate  of  return  on  equity,  counter-\nguarantees of the Government, and tax-exempt status. In response to the announcement of the\npolicy in 1991, more than 250 proposals were submitted by independent power producers (IPP).\nHowever, implementation of these private sector projects were delayed because of high capital\ncosts, and the potential foreign exchange liabilities of the Government on account of sovereign\nguarantees. As the projects were initially awarded on the basis of memoranda of understanding\nrather than through competitive bidding, the capital costs tended to be higher than those of\npublic sector projects, and resulted in higher tariffs. Unresolved issues related to tariffs, security\nof payment, and fuel supply have delayed progress on the private sector projects.9\n31. Inadequate transmission infrastructure for power evacuation has been one of the major\nconstraints in the progress of some large-scale IPP projects. For example, one of the reasons\nfor lack of financial closure for some IPP power projects such as Cogentrix (1,000 MW) in\nKarnataka was the uncertainty of finalizing the associated transmission project. To cover the\nshortfall in transmission investments, on 10 August 1998 the Indian Parliament  enacted the\nElectricity Laws (Amendment) Act, 1998 (Transmission Act) to recognize transmission as an\nindependent  activity  that  can  also  be  implemented  through  private  sector  participation  in\ntransmission projects. Under this act, a transmission license can be granted to any person,\nauthorizing such licensee to construct and maintain any interstate or intrastate transmission\n                                                \n7  The TAs for Gujarat include: (i) 2738-IND: Preparation of a Power System Master Plan for $600,000; (ii) 2739-IND:\nDevelopment  of a Framework for Electricity Tariffs for $300,000; (iii) 2740-IND: Review of Electricity Legislation\nand Regulations for $235,000; (iv) Financial Management Support to Kheda and Rajkot Distribution Profit Centers\nfor $580,000; all approved on 17 December 1996 and Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Project, for\n$1,000,000 approved on 7 January 1998.\n8 TA No. 3305\u2013IND: Support to the Power Finance Corporation, for $1.0 million,  approved on 24 November 1999.\n9  Although the state governments tried to address the issue of security of payment and to introduce competitive\nbidding, capacity addition by the private sector during the period 1992-1999 was only about 2,600 MW. Recently,\nas part of further action to facilitate private sector participation, the Government decided to allow the state\ngovernments to clear, without reference to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, fully foreign-owned power\nplants, each up to an investment ceiling of Rs15 billion (approximately $376 million).", "8\nsystem under the direction, control, and supervision of the central or state transmission utilities,\nrespectively.\n32. Since Powergrid is the central agency responsible for the construction and operation of\nthe main transmission network in each region of India as well as for all interregional tie lines, it\nhas  been  entrusted  with  the  selection  of  sponsors  for  private  sector  and  joint-venture\ntransmission projects at the national or regional level. Since real-time operation of a bulk\ntransmission system is strongly related to the security, reliability, safety of the power system,\nand  fair  power  transactions,  private  companies  will  not  be  involved  in  the  operation  of\ntransmission lines, load dispatching, and coordination. The Government also proposed to apply\na bulk transmission tariff structure for these projects with incentives similar to those for IPPs,\nwith fixed charges based on the availability of the contracted transmission system.\n4.  Powergrid\u2019s Role in the Reforms\n33. The  three-phase  development  of  Powergrid\u2019s  transmission  systems  and  operations\ndescribed in paras. 18 and 19 will facilitate the restructuring of the power sector into separate\nand more efficient generation and distribution companies. The development of the regional and\nnational transmission grids and control centers will also improve the coordination and efficiency\nof power sector operations on regional and national basis. The World Bank\u2019s study \"India: Long-\nTerm Issues in the Power Sector,\" prepared in 1991, concluded that improved coordination in\nsystem operations, through such measures as effective operation of the regional grids and\nimproved bulk power tariffs, could reduce the total unserved electric energy by half of the then\nprevailing level of about 9 percent of total energy demand. Potential savings through improved\ncoordination in operations and commercialization were estimated at $5 billion to $10 billion by\nthe year 2001. The study further estimated that the unserved energy demand could be reduced\nby an additional 30 percent, and fuel costs could also be reduced, if interregional transmission\nfacilities were developed for national power trading. The combined savings were found to be\nequivalent to about 10 percent of the total capital investment required in the power sector over\nthis  period.  Clearly,  Powergrid  has  a  major  role  to  play  in  improving  the  efficiency  and\nproductivity of India\u2019s power sector.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n34. The power sector has received a major portion of India's external assistance. Of ADB\u2019s\ntotal Government-guaranteed lending to India amounting to $7.718 billion as of end 1999, six\nloans for $1.265 billion (16 percent) have been approved for the power sector. The first four\nprojects were for power generation; the two most recent have been sector loans to support\nimprovements in the efficiency of SEBs and development of the national transmission grid. In\naddition, the ADB's private sector group (PSG) has approved three loans and investments\ntotaling  $79.8  million  for  one  captive  transmission  and  two  generation  projects.  10  Power\nsubprojects  have  also  been  considered  for  financing  under  the  ADB's  private  sector\ninfrastructure facility 11 and the Infrastructure Development Finance Company.12 ADB also has\n                                                \n10 Loan 7058/1036-IND: CESC Limited, for $17.8 million approved on 4 October 1990; Loan 7082/1142-IND: CESC\nLimited II, for $32.0 million approved on 13 December 1991; and Loan 7130/1499-IND: Balagarh Power Company\nLimited for $15 million in equity  and a  loan of $25 million, approved on 5 December 1996.\n11 Loan 1480-IND: Private Sector Facility: Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd.; 1481-IND:\nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Facility: Industrial Finance Corp. of India Ltd.; 1482-IND: Private Sector Infrastructure\nFacility: SCICI Ltd. approved on 7 November 1996 for a total of $300 million.\n12 Investment 7138-IND: Infrastructure Development Finance Company, for $30 million equity investment approved\non 14 October 1997. The loan amount was subsequently reduced to $15.463 million due to greater than expected\nsubscription from the investors.", "9\napproved $11.834 million for 16 TAs mainly advisory, at both the national and state levels. The\nTAs have focused on environmental and pollution control issues related to power generation,\nbulk transmission tariffs, improving least-cost system planning, tariff studies at the retail level,\nimprovement  of  technical  and  commercial  operations,  power  sector  restructuring,  and\nestablishment of an independent regulatory authority. Previous ADB assistance to the power\nsector in India is listed in Appendix 3.\n35. The major funding source to the sector is the World Bank group. NTPC, the World\nBank's largest single client worldwide, has been a major beneficiary of this assistance. The\nWorld Bank has supported power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, including\nassistance  directed  to  SEBs.  ADB  coordinates  with  the  World  Bank  on  the  geographical\ndemarcation of state-level operations, as well as to ensure overall complementarity of actions at\nboth the central and state levels. ADB and the World Bank have concurrent ongoing operations\nfor  different  projects  with  three  organizations:  PFC,  Powergrid,  and  NTPC.  Other  major\nagencies  funding  the  sector  are  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),\nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (for the Government of Germany), DFID, CIDA, and USAID.\nAlthough the combined assistance of all aid agencies constitutes only about 8-10 percent of the\ntotal investments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have been catalyzed as a result of\nthis assistance. Major external assistance provided to Powergrid by other aid agencies is also\nlisted in Appendix 3.\n36. About $5 billion of investment will be necessary to transmit output power with adequate\nreliability and quality from the proposed large-scale additional generating capacity programmed\nduring the next five years (Appendix 2). Powergrid has segregated and prioritized the total\ninvestments and has posed subprojects for assistance to the World Bank, ADB, and some\nbilateral aid agencies.\n37. The World Bank has the same general direction and agenda as ADB in the sector and is\nprocessing a similar loan to Powergrid based on its \u201ctime slice\u201d project concept. The World Bank\nis also supporting power sector reforms in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa,\nRajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. In Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, power sector reform is\nviewed as part of overall reform of the state finances as is being attempted by ADB in Gujarat\nand Madhya Pradesh.\n38. JBIC  is  supporting  the  expansion  of  public  sector  generation,  transmission  and\ndistribution including rural electrification. It has no geographic preferences.\n39. DFID is financing studies for restructuring of the sector in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and\nOrissa. It has no plans to participate in the financing of hardware other than in renewable\nenergy systems. It has offered to cooperate with ADB in funding studies for power sector\nrestructuring in Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal states and to assist these states in other\nareas also, preferably in the \"soft\" sectors.\n40. USAID has extensively supported and continues to support policy aspects of private\nsector participation. It has supported studies for state sector reforms through PFC, and through\nprovision of grant assistance for energy management, conservation and training. It is working\nwith ADB and PFC for studies in Assam, Punjab and West Bengal.\n41. CIDA has assisted Kerala in conducting extensive studies for restructuring its power\nsector, and is working with ADB in conducting such studies in Madhya Pradesh,  and with the", "10\nWorld Bank in Andhra Pradesh. ADB is following up on CIDA's work in Kerala through its policy\ndialogue and preparations for a possible loan project.\n42. The broad policy content of the Project has been discussed with all the aid agencies,\nwhich have supported activities associated with sector reforms at the central and state levels.\nAll these agencies have expressed general support for the Project.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n1.  Overall Bank Operations\n43. The  operations  of  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  in  the  power  sector  in  India  have\ngenerally been successful from a project point of view; i.e., the projects concerned have been\ncompleted, although with implementation delays, and performed to the desired technical levels.\nHowever,  except  for  the  ongoing  loan  to  Powergrid,  these  projects  were  not  designed  to\nchange the business environment, and the sector performance has continued to deteriorate,\nalthough the operations of the project components, taken individually, were  satisfactory. This\nwas primarily on account of the (i) political interference in tariff setting; (ii) rapid growth of the\ndemand for electricity, making conventional investment strategies unworkable; (iii) government\nrules and regulations and control of the SEBs that inhibited speedy decision making; and (iv) the\nnoncommercial setup of the sector that did not generate the market for alternative players to\nstep in to bridge the gap between supply and demand.\n44. In the past, ADB extended assistance to discrete power projects in various states as well\nas to the central power sector agencies. Although this policy enabled ADB to support many\nprojects, it spread ADB's resources too thinly, with the result that it could not achieve its desired\ngoal of policy reforms with its power sector borrowers. In most states, the power sector was the\nlargest recipient of state resources, in terms of both subsidies and in terms capital investments,\nand it was realized that macro management of the state's finances needed to be improved for\nthe successful turnaround of the power sector. Therefore, ADB is now assisting states for power\nsector reforms only in the context of a holistic change in their macroeconomic management.\n2.  Policy Achievements of the Ongoing Loan to Powergrid\n45. On the physical side, the objectives of the ongoing loan are to strengthen Powergrid\u2019s\ntransmission systems in order to reduce system losses and allow efficient utilization of existing\nand planned power plants by: (i) supporting development of the Northeastern regional power\ngrid;  (ii)  interconnecting  the  Southern  and  Eastern  regional  power  grids;  (iii)  constructing\ntransmission facilities for power evacuation from new and expanded power plants.\n46. On  the  reforms  side,  the  ADB\u2019s  intervention  in  the  sector  through  Powergrid  has\nimproved commercialization and overall operating efficiencies in the sector. A covenant on\nlimiting  accounts  receivable,  coupled  with  the  provision  for  suspension  of  investments  in\ndelinquent states, has pressured most states to maintain their outstanding dues with Powergrid\nwithin reasonable limits. A covenant on implementing an economic dispatch policy has resulted\nin the decision to establish the CERC and switch over to an \u201cavailability\u201d based tariff for power\nstations owned by central public sector units. This is expected to enhance efficiencies in the\nproduction and use of generation assets.\n47. The implementation of the ongoing loan has been successful. Powergrid\u2019s management\nand administration capability have improved, as well as their technical capability to physically", "11\nimplement projects. The entire loan has been committed, and about 63 percent has been\ndisbursed. The majority of the contracts have been awarded on or ahead of schedule. The\nshortfalls in disbursement have largely been due to the depreciation of the rupee versus the\ndollar over the past five years. The Government and Powergrid have generally met the loan\nconditions and covenants, except for those pertaining to penal interest rates 13 and accounts\nreceivables. 14\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n48. ADB\u2019s operational strategy in India is to support efforts to achieve higher sustainable\neconomic growth to promote employment and reduce poverty. Its contribution to higher growth\nfocuses  on  improving  the  supply  side  efficiency  of  the  economy,  especially  by  reducing\nbottlenecks in key infrastructure sectors. Emphasis is on improving the policy, institutional, and\nregulatory  framework  so  as  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  operations  and  to\nencourage  private  investment.  Improving  resource  mobilization  to  finance  the  necessary\ninvestments is a key component of ADB\u2019s assistance, and includes support for the development\nof financial and capital markets as well as for improving internal resource mobilization in the\nsector agencies and enhancing their creditworthiness. High priority is also given to assisting\nprojects that contribute to environmental improvement.\n49. ADB's strategy for India was revised in 1996 to accommodate an urgent need for a\nportion of its assistance to be provided in a systematic and comprehensive way at the sub-\nnational or state level. This need reflects the facts that (i) a geographic focus, together with the\nongoing selective sector focus, enables ADB to maximize its developmental impact both in the\nstates concerned and, through the demonstrational impact of its operations, on other states as\nwell; (ii)  state-level economic reforms, which have been lagging behind initiatives taken by the\nGovernment, need support and incentives; and (iii) the states have considerable autonomy and\nhave major legislative, administrative, and fiscal responsibilities in many economic sectors. Key\nelements  of  the  subnational  assistance  include  (i)  reducing  the  states'  fiscal  deficits,\n(ii) reforming and restructuring public sector enterprises, and (iii) supporting reforms in key\ninfrastructure sectors with a view to increasing private investment. Gujarat was the first state\nchosen for this type of holistic support and the first loan was granted by ADB in December\n1996.15 Madhya Pradesh is the second and its loan was accorded in December 1999. 16\n50. Reflecting ADB\u2019s overall country strategy for India and in recognition of the dualistic\nstructure of India's power sector, ADB's strategy for the sector, which has been pursued in\ncoordination  with  the  World  Bank,  intends  to  operate  at  two  levels.  At  the  central  level,\n                                                \n13 Powergrid\u2019s current tariff agreements with SEBs provide for a penal rate of 1.5 percent.  Although the penalty rate\nwas to be raised from 1.5 to 2.0 percent in accordance with the Loan condition, it is recognized that the use of a\nrebate system in the billing to encourage prompt payments would be better to improve collections. Until 1994, a flat\n1.0 percent rebate was provided for prompt payment of bills. Since then Powergrid has enhanced the rebate up to\n2.5 percent on a staged basis. This rebate scheme has been effective in expediting payments, except for chronic\ndefaulters. Therefore, the requirement to increase the penal rate has been  waived since this does not seem to be\nan effective instrument in increasing payments and incentives seem to be working better.\n14 Accounts receivable have generally exceeded the covenanted level of 2.0 months of billing on account of\ndelinquency by a few large SEBs. However, the Government and Powergrid have taken actions to reduce them. As\non 31 May 2000, exclusive of the amount under central appropriation, Powergrid\u2019s receivables were equal to 5.6\nmonths of billing. However, in the western and southern regions where most of the approved subprojects are\nlocated, the outstanding receivables were equal to only 1.78 months and 1.08 months, respectively.\n15Loan  1506-IND:  Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program,  for  $250  million  approved  on\n18 December 1996.\n16 Loan  1717-IND:  Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program,  for  $250  million  approved  on\n14 December 1999.", "12\nassistance is provided to central power sector companies such as Powergrid 17 and PFC 18, with\na view to supporting their commercialization and using them as agents to leverage reform in\ntheir  client  SEBs.  Through  Powergrid,  ADB  also  seeks,  at  the  central  level,  to  implement\nnationwide power sector reforms through establishment of model cases in tariff structures,\ncompetitive pool operations; regulation of power supply to delinquent SEBs, and investments\nbased on commercial viability of projects. At the state level, by considering assistance only for\nstates that demonstrate the political will to substantially restructure and commercialize their\npower sectors, and by assisting them to actualize the reforms, ADB is building up the reforms\nprocess from the grassroots. Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala states have been identified\nfor ADB\u2019s holistic support. Improvements in the power sector, will increase the fiscal space of\nthe  state  governments  and  increase  their  ability  to  allocate  more  resources  for  poverty\nalleviation.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n1.  Introduction of Availability Based Tariff\n51. Availability-based  tariffs  19  are  necessary  for  competitive  merit  order  dispatch  of\ngenerated  power,  which  ensures  that  the  electricity  pool  makes  available  the  lowest-cost\ngeneration to its consumers. In India, this has not been possible on account of the plant-load-\nfactor-based tariff currently in force for generation stations. As part of policy dialogue under its\nongoing loan activity,  ADB requested the Government and Powergrid to examine the feasibility\nof introducing availability-based tariff for at least central sector generation in every electricity\nregion. As a result of this dialogue, a National Task Force chaired by CEA, was appointed to\nimplement  the  recommendation  of  the  ADB-financed  tariff  study.  In  its  eighth  meeting  on\n7 October 1997, the National Task Force decided on a time-bound program for implementing\navailability-based tariff. Mock exercises to ensure that necessary metering and other matching\nfacilities  were  in  place,  were  carried  out  in  1997  and  1998.  On  4  January  2000,  CERC\nannounced its decision to implement availability-based tariff in a phased manner for all central\ngeneration. The switch to availability-based tariff was directed to be undertaken from April 2000\nfor the south electricity region and June 2000 for the east electricity region. However, NTPC has\nsought a judicial review of some of the aspects of CERC\u2019s decision, and the court has referred\nthe same to CERC for its consideration. It is expected that availability-based tariffs will be\nimplemented by 1 April 2001.\n2.  Facilitating SEB Reforms\n52. The main problem in the sector is the default in payments by delinquent SEBs. In the\npast no attempt was made to distinguish between good and bad SEBs in terms of investment by\ncentral PSUs, and little attempt to commercially enforce the bulk supply contracts. ADB\u2019s policy\ndialogue requested power supply restrictions to defaulting SEBs under the ongoing loan and a\npolicy of not investing for their benefit. Powergrid agreed, and these actions have halted the\ndeterioration in the realization of accounts receivable from defaulting SEBs. In accordance with\nthe covenant of the ongoing loan, the Government released to Powergrid a general advisory on\n                                                \n17 Loan No. 1405-IND: Power Transmission (Sector) Project, for $275 million approved on 16 November 1995.\n18 Loan No. 1161-IND: Power Efficiency (Sector) Project, approved on 26 March 1992 for $250 million. The loan\naccount was closed on  18 December 1998.\n19 Availability based tariff means a tariff structure composed of a capacity charge and an energy charge. The capacity\ncharge is based on the availability of the generating unit concerned to produce power should it be called upon to do\nso, irrespective of its actual usage. This enables the dispatcher to effectively use all the generators in the system in\na competitive manner. Plant-Load-Factor based tariff is a payment based on the actual usage of the plant, and\nprovides an incentive for the generator to maximize generation, irrespective of whether it is required or not.", "13\npower supply restriction to defaulting SEBs in March 1996 for the Andhra Pradesh SEB and in\nMay 1996 for the SEBs of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. In May 1996, as a follow-up\nmeasure, Powergrid and NTPC exercised partial power supply restriction on Uttar Pradesh.\nThese measures have helped to improve commercial discipline in the SEBs.\n53. As of June 2000, the major defaulters among SEBs  are Bihar SEB (Rs1,072.98 million\nor 8.84 months of sales), and the Delhi Vidyut Board (Rs738.75 million or 7.35 months of sales).\nUPPCL which was one of the major defaulters recently agreed to increase the amount in letter\nof credit from Rs80 million to Rs120 million and has liquidated all outstanding dues as on March\n1999, both principal and a large portion of the surcharge, in the form of bonds in June 2000. To\nencourage large defaulting states to reduce their outstanding dues, ADB\u2019s subproject condition,\ncovenanted under the ongoing loan, that Powergrid will not seek to invest in assets that will\nbenefit states that have outstanding dues of more than two months of sales to them, will be\nmaintained. The overall position of outstanding accounts in the southern and western regions,\nwhere  most  of  the  Project\u2019s  subprojects  are  located,  is  satisfactory  at  -0.39  (credit)  and\n0.36 months of billing, respectively.\n3.  Financial Strengthening of the Transmission Subsector\n54. In accordance with the covenant of the ongoing loan, the Government, on 16 December\n1997, issued a notification to set Powergrid\u2019s transmission tariff at a level that will enable\nPowergrid  to  recover  full  cost  of  its  services  and  earn  a  16  percent  return  on  its  equity\ninvestments. The notification is retroactive from 1 April 1997 and is provided for in the loan\nagreements entered into between Powergrid and the SEBs. Powergrid has revised its contracts\nwith each SEB to reflect this change. This measure further enhances Powergrid\u2019s financial\nstrength to be able to invest and expand on its own.\n4.  Commercialization of Powergrid\n55. Since the start commencement of commercial operations in 1991, Powergrid has\ngrown rapidly to become one of the largest power transmission companies in the world. Apart\nfrom physical expansion, it has registered healthy growth rates in sales revenue and profits. In\nthis growth phase, Powergrid has been supported by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies with\ntheir funds guaranteed by the Government. The past success of Powergrid has motivated the\nGovernment to encourage Powergrid to further commercialize all aspects of its functioning,\nalbeit in a phased manner. This objective of the Government is fully recognized and supported\nby Powergrid, and is also in line with ADB\u2019s philosophy of allowing competent beneficiaries to\n\u201cgraduate\u201d from its lending programs. In line with this objective, the following policy dialogue\nwas undertaken in processing the Project.\na.  Enhancement of Autonomy\n56. In  August  1998,  as  a  measure  of  distancing  the  Government  from  Powergrid  and\nstrengthening the capability of its board of directors, the board was reconstituted to comprise\nfive  full-time  board  members  from  Powergrid\u2019s  management  (including  its  chairman  and\nmanaging director); two members from the Government, and three non-government members.\nThe outsiders are eminent personalities from the private sector and at present are (i) the\nChairman  and  managing  director  of  the  Bombay  Suburban  Electric  Supply  Company,  the\nlargest  private  sector  distribution  company  in  India;  (ii)  the  managing  director  of  the\nInfrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited, a private sector fund; and (iii) a professor", "14\nof the Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad, the top school for management education\nin India.\n57. In addition to the restructuring of Powergrid\u2019s board of directors, the Government also\nenhanced the autonomy of Powergrid by giving it the power to approve projects costing less\nthan  Rs3,000 million ($68.8 million), subject to other statutory clearances and approvals. This\nmeasure  has  considerably  enhanced  Powergrid\u2019s  autonomy  and  flexibility  to  respond  to\nbusiness opportunities.\nb.  Commercial Borrowings from International Financial Markets\n58. For its long-term capital needs, Powergrid needs to tap international financial markets.\nTherefore, as part of the Project\u2019s financing arrangements, it is proposed to mobilize commercial\ncofinancing of  $120 million (30 percent of total foreign currency requirements of the Project) by\nway of an international syndicated loan, with credit enhancement by ADB through the use of its\npartial credit guarantee facility. The Government has agreed to counterguarantee ADB\u2019s partial\ncredit guarantee.  This will be the first foreign currency loan with a final maturity of 15 years for\nPowergrid.\n59. To progressively move away from Government-guaranteed financing and to leverage its\nown considerable self-generated resources through market borrowings, Powergrid, as part of\nthe policy dialogue for the Project, has adopted a policy and financial planning of not seeking\nGovernment-guaranteed funds for projects costing less than Rs1,000 million each after FY2002.\nThis policy has been covenanted under the loan.\nc.  Private Sector Participation in the Transmission Subsector\n60. Intensive discussions were held with Powergrid and the Government on the sector\u2019s\npolicy  to  introduce  private  sector  participation  in  the  transmission  subsector.  The  need  to\nestablish fair, transparent, and competitive practices in establishing private sector transmission\nprojects  was  emphasized.  Introduction  of  private  sector  participation  through  fair  and\ntransparent competition will be beneficial for the entire transmission subsector by providing\nbenchmarks for construction costs and costs of finance. ADB provided TA20 to assist Powergrid\nin competitively soliciting for private sector implementation of the Vizag-Vijayawada 400 kV\ntransmission  line.  When  implemented,  this  line  will  be  the  first  extra-high  voltage  line\nestablished by the private sector for a central or state power utility.\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n61. The Project furthers the ongoing power sector reforms at the central level to (i) improve\ngovernance, (ii) build long-term institutional capacity, (iii) improve efficiencies, and (iv) facilitate\nprivate sector participation.\n62. Investment of about $5 billion will be necessary to transmit with adequate reliability and\nquality output power from the additional generating capacity programmed during the next five\nyears.  Substantial  investments  are  also  needed  during  the  next  five  years  for  system\nstrengthening.  The  Project  will  focus  on  subprojects  that  are  essential  for  entire  system\n                                                \n20 TA 3380\u2013IND:Private Sector Participation in Electricity Transmission, for $600,000, approved on 28 December\n1999.", "15\nperformance. Such subprojects will also facilitate private sector participation although indirectly,\nin the generation and distribution subsectors through improvement of power system reliability\nand  performance.  The  loan  will  finance  part  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  a  group  of\ntransmission subprojects to be undertaken during a five-year time slice commencing in 2000.\nThe subprojects are accorded high priority by the Government and Powergrid and are an\nintegral part of Powergrid\u2019s transmission development plan.\n63. To leverage sector reform at the state level, the Project is designed to differentiate\nbetween states undertaking sector reform and those that are not, in selecting subprojects under\nthe proposed loan. The proposed Project will provide strong transmission networks to switch\npower supply from delinquent state power sector entities to those that have good payment\nrecords, and also accord preference in investment to improve transmission service to these\nentities.\n64. The sector loan modality is being adopted for this loan to provide flexibility in choosing\nsubprojects that meet technical, financial, economic, environmental, and social criteria agreed\nupon  by  Powergrid  and  ADB.  The  sector  loan  approach  will  also  provide  Powergrid  with\nsufficient flexibility to optimally utilize the commercial cofinancing raised using ADB\u2019s partial\ncredit guarantee facility.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n65. The technical objective is to strengthen Powergrid\u2019s transmission systems to improve\nsystem  reliability,  reduce  transmission  losses,  improve  system  quality,  and  allow  efficient\nutilization of existing and planned generation plants. The strategic objectives are to (i) support\nthe restructuring of India\u2019s power sector; (ii) enable private sector participation, (iii) encourage\nthe adoption of appropriate pricing mechanisms for all bulk supply of electricity; and (iv) improve\nthe commercial basis for all transmission transactions, thus ensuring Powergrid's profitability,\nliquidity, and ability to mobilize more commercial counterpart funds. The Project will also help\nPowergrid\u2019s transition from relying on Government-guaranteed programs and funds to funding\nthrough market-based programs, thus making Powergrid more autonomous and commercially\noriented.\n66. The Project has two components: Part A: upgrading and expanding 400 kV, 220 kV, and\n132 kV transmission systems to transfer additional power, to improve system reliability, and\nenhance the efficient utilization of power plants; and Part B: installing 400 kV and 220 kV\ntransmission systems to evacuate the power generated by central power utilities and IPPs.\n67. The candidate subprojects are described briefly in Appendix 4.\nC.  Technical Justification and Criteria for Subproject Selection\n68. Subprojects were selected on the basis of (i) technical suitability; (ii) environmental and\nsocial soundness conforming to relevant ADB guidelines; (iii) financial viability: the financial\ninternal rate  of  return  (FIRR)  being  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital\n(WACC); (iv) economic viability: the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) being greater than\n12   percent;  and  (v)  satisfactory  payment  record  of  the  major  beneficiary  SEBs:  accounts\nreceivable being less than two months equivalent of sales. The justification of each subproject is\nsupported by load-flow diagrams, evaluation of alternatives, detailed design, cost estimates,\nfinancial  and  economic  analyses,  summary  initial  examination  of  environmental  and  social", "16\nissues,  and  implementation  schedules.  Nine  subprojects  were  selected  as  candidate\nsubprojects under Powergrid\u2019s transmission development plan for support under this loan.\n69. To date, four subprojects have been preliminarily approved by ADB and one is in an\nadvanced stage of approval. Since all the identified subprojects are based on well-proven\ntechnology  and  are  generally  within  Powergrid\u2019s  implementation  capability,  there  are  no\nsignificant  technical  or  engineering  risks.  Through  the  investment  in  these  subprojects,\nPowergrid will improve its system to international standards of availability and reliability.\n70. India has idle generating capability, especially in the eastern and northeastern regions,\nbecause of inadequate transmission facilities. The excess generating capacity in the eastern\nregion alone is about 1,800 MW. On the other hand the southern, western and northern regions\nare in short supply. Interconnecting areas with deficits and surpluses will provide a market to the\nareas with surplus and alleviate the shortages in the deficit regions. This will decrease the\noverall cost of supply to all regions. Inadequate transmission facilities have also led to local\nimbalances in the demand-supply situation even in areas with sufficient generation capacity\ncausing low voltage and load shedding. In some cases, a breakdown at one point of the system\ncauses  a  cascade  of  system  outages  and  results  in  large-scale,  statewide,  or  regionwide\nblackouts. Subprojects in part A will address such problems and will facilitate the supply of\nadditional  power,  thereby  using  planned  and  existing  power  generation  capacity  optimally.\nSubprojects in part B will provide transmission systems for new generating stations under\ncentral sector agencies and IPPs.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n71. The total cost of the identified subprojects is $491.5 million equivalent (Rs25,828 million)\ncomprising foreign exchange costs of $394.2 million (80.2 percent) and local currency costs of\n$97.3 million equivalent (19.8 percent). The cost estimates are expressed in 2000 prices and\ninclude  provisions  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,  currency  movements,  and  interest\nduring  construction  (IDC).  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1  and  detailed  in\nAppendix 5. However, since this is a sector loan, Powergrid retains the flexibility to add or\ndelete,  subprojects to this list.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency\nBase Cost\n  Part A 117.3 21.5 52.8\n  Part B 163.7 12.5 262.2\n  Tax and Duties 0.0 35.9 35.9\n          Subtotal 281.0 69.9 350.9\nPhysical Contingency a 28.1 7.0 35.1\nPrice Contingency b 21.3 9.1 30.4\n  IDC 63.8 11.3 75.1\n          Total 394.2 97.3 491.5\na Physical contingency computed as 10 percent of base cost.\nb Price contingency computed on the basis of 6.5 percent local currency and 2.4 percent per\nannum on foreign exchange costs.", "17\nE.  Financing Plan, Cofinancing Loan and Partial Credit Guarantee\n72. The proposed ADB loan of $250 million will finance a major part of the foreign currency\ncosts, including the related front-end fee, commitment charges, and IDC. The loan will be drawn\nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will have a repayment period of 20 years, including a\ngrace period of 5 years. The interest will be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based\nvariable lending rate for US dollar loans. Powergrid will be the Borrower, with a guarantee from\nthe Government, and will bear the foreign exchange risk.  The financing plan is in Table 2.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total %\nCurrency Currency\nADB Loan 250.0 0.0 250.0 51\nInternational\nCommercial Cofinancing 120.0 0.0 120.0 25\nDomestic Borrowing 0.0 16.3 16.3 3\nPowergrid 24.2 81.0 105.2 21\nTotal Project Cost 394.2 97.3 491.5 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank;  Powergrid = Power Grid Corporation of India Limited\n73. Powergrid will meet 24 percent of the total project cost from its internal cash generation,\nand domestic commercial borrowing, including foreign exchange of $24.2 million. The remaining\nforeign currency requirement, amounting to 25 percent of total project cost, is proposed to be\nraised through a cofinancing loan of $120 million sourced from offshore commercial lenders in\nthe syndicated bank loan market. The lead arranger bank has fully underwritten the loan. The\ncofinancing loan will have a final maturity of 15 years, including a grace period of four years.\nPowergrid will be the Borrower. The cofinancing loan will be supported by an ADB partial credit\nguarantee covering interest payments and principal re-payments due from years 8 through 15.\nThe main terms and conditions of the cofinancing loan are summarized in Appendix 6. The\ncofinancing loan, the ADB's partial credit guarantee, and the Government's counter guarantee\nare subject to the final terms and conditions being mutually accepted by the Government,\nPowergrid and ADB. In case the cofinancing does not materialize within six months from the\ndate of approval of the Loan, Powergrid shall raise necessary funds of upto $120 million, to the\nsatisfaction of ADB, to ensure timely completion of the Project.\n74. An ADB guarantee was necessary to obtain the required long-term debt financing and to\nimprove the terms of such financing. At present, Indian borrowers, including public sector\nborrowers such as Powergrid, can achieve maximum maturities of up to 7 years on their own\ncredit. Longer-term financing is generally not available. However, the proposed Project (like\nother  capital-intensive  infrastructure  projects),  requires  extended  maturities  to  amortize  its\nexpenditures. To achieve this, the ADB guarantee was applied to years 8 through 15 of the\ncofinancing loan, leaving the debt service falling due prior to that uncovered. The pricing of the\ncofinancing loan (expressed as a margin above LIBOR)21 is 80 basis points per annum in years\n1 through 7, reducing to 20 basis points per annum in years 8 through 15 (the period covered by\n                                                \n21The cofinancing loan is structured as a floating rate loan priced against the London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR).", "18\nthe ADB guarantee).  This pricing is considered competitive and properly reflective of the credit\nenhancement provided by the ADB guarantee. ADB will charge a guarantee fee of 0.40% p.a.\non present values of the guarantee obligations and a front-end fee of 0.39% of the nominal\nguaranteed amount in accordance with the ADB\u2019s guarantee policy (Estimated guarantee fees\nschedule is in Appendix 6).\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Implementation Schedule\n75. The subprojects will be implemented over five years from November 2000 to September\n2005.  The  implementation  schedule  of  the  five  candidate  subprojects  that  have  secured\npreliminary  approval,  or  are  in  an  advanced  stage  of  securing  such  approval,  is  given  in\nAppendix 7. Procurement activities for the first subprojects have commenced.\n76. Powergrid will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB, within 30 days after the end of\neach  quarter.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  of  the  subprojects  and  meet  with  the\nconcerned staff of Powergrid to discuss progress. ADB will also monitor Powergrid\u2019s overall\ntechnical and financial performance. In view of the long lead time needed to implement major\ntransmission projects, Powergrid will submit for ADB\u2019s approval by June 2002 the appraisal\nreports for the remaining subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan.\n2.  Procurement of Equipment and Materials\n77. Equipment and materials will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB)\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The agreed upon contract package list\nfor the first five subprojects, which may attract international bidders, is indicated in Appendix 8.\nContract packages and bid specifications have been prepared in such a way as to ensure\nmaximum  competition  under  ICB.  Similar  contractual  structures  and  specifications  will  be\napplied to other subprojects. Powergrid will provide a procurement notice for inclusion in ADB\nBusiness Opportunities at least 42 days before issuing bidding documents for any contract\nfinanced by ADB. Local manufacturers and contractors may participate in the bidding and avail\nof  a  15  percent  domestic  preference  margin.  If  procurement  is  done  under  international\nshopping, ADB\u2019s standard procedures and threshold limits will be followed. ADB\u2019s funds will not\nbe utilized to fund procurement under local competitive bidding procedures.\n78. To  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB  has  allowed  advance\nprocurement action for eligible subprojects. As of August 2000, four subprojects have been\npreliminarily approved and one other is in an advanced stage of approval. However, approval of\nadvance procurement action does not in any way commit ADB to finance the proposed Project.\nADB will not consider retroactive financing for expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness.\n79. For contracts to be awarded based on ICB procurement procedures, Powergrid shall be\nexempted from ADB\u2019s prior review of its bid documents provided that such documents are\nforwarded at the time of their release to ADB for post-facto approval, and Powergrid issues\namendments to such documents based on comments made by ADB, if any, during the bidding\nperiod. Further, Powergrid may also award contracts of value less than $3.0 million in each case\nwithout seeking approval of ADB, provided the lowest priced bidder is also the lowest evaluated\nbidder, and further provided that (i) all cases involving unusual issues shall be submitted to ADB\nfor prior approval, and (ii) all cases shall be subject to post-facto approval of ADB which shall\nretain  the  right  to  disallow  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  in  case  it  is  unable  to  agree  with\nPowergrid on either the bid documents or the bid evaluation report.", "19\n3.  Disbursement Procedures\n80. ADB\u2019s direct payment, commitment letter, or reimbursement procedures will be applied\nfor turnkey contracts, for supply, delivery, and installation of goods, and for procurement of\ngoods, materials, equipment, and services.\n4.  Reports,  Accounts,  and Audits\n81. Powergrid will prepare separate progress reports for their respective components and\nsubmit them to ADB on a quarterly basis. The reports will provide a narrative description of\nprogress  made  during  the  period,  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or\ndifficulties encountered, and the work to be carried out in the upcoming period. The progress\nreports will also include a summary financial account for the Project. It will consist of project\nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review the\nimplementation and operation of the Project based on these reports and meet with the executing\nagencies  and  the  Government  semiannually  to  discuss  project  progress.  Project  completion\nreports will be submitted to ADB within six months of project completion.\n82. Powergrid will have its annual financial statements - income statement, balance sheet,\nand sources and application of funds statement-audited by an auditing firm acceptable to ADB.\nCertified audited accounts and financial statements of Powergrid will be submitted to ADB within\nsix months of the close of the financial year. Powergrid will also submit audited accounts for the\nProject each year, within six months of the close of each financial year.\nG.  The Executing Agency\n1.  Organization\n83. Powergrid will be the Executing Agency for the Project. Powergrid is managed by a\nboard of directors consisting of a full-time chairman/managing director, four full-time directors,\nthree  part-time  directors  from  the  private  sector,  and  two  directors  representing  the\nGovernment. Powergrid\u2019s board has full powers for day-to-day operation and administration and\nlimited  powers  for  capital  investment.  Similar  to  other  Government-owned  enterprises,\nPowergrid annually signs a memorandum of understanding with the Government which sets\noperational and financial performance targets and the Government\u2019s corresponding obligations.\n84. Powergrid\u2019s organizational structure (Appendix 9) consists of (i) a corporate center at the\nhead office in New Delhi that is responsible for overall corporate planning, system planning and\nengineering, management of transmission system operations and projects, finance, commercial\nmatters, and personnel; and (ii) regional headquarters, each of which manages several group\nheadquarters. Powergrid\u2019s projects department at the corporate headquarters in New Delhi will\nundertake planning, design, procurement, and will also liase with ADB. Regional offices will be\nresponsible for construction supervision, commissioning, maintenance, and operation.\n85. Powergrid has strong capability in project implementation and designs and manages its\nprojects on its own with limited use of external consultants. Powergrid usually retains the\nresponsibility for implementing and coordinating projects; contractors are used for erection work.\nSite supervisors report to the executive directors of the regions. The regional executive directors\nchair monthly review meetings to review progress and address implementation issues. Site\nmanagers authorize payments to suppliers and contractors. The management of Powergrid\nreceives monthly progress reports and reviews each subproject in quarterly project review", "20\ncommittee meetings. Powergrid has introduced computerized project management systems to\nassist with planning and monitoring of project implementation and to facilitate comprehensive\nand timely progress reporting. Powergrid\u2019s organization structure and management systems\nhave been found adequate for its operations.\n2.  Financial Performance\n86. Powergrid has been operating profitably since its first full year of commercial operations,\nwhich ended on 31 March 1994. A summary of past financial performance indicators is in\nTable 3. Historical financial statements, financial projections, and the critical assumptions used\nin developing the financial projections are provided in Appendix 10.\n                Table 3: Summary of Past Financial Performance of Powergrid\n(Rs million)\nItem FY1994 FY1995 FY1996 FY1997 FY1998 FY1999 FY2000\n(provisional)\nTotal Revenue 6,487 8,099 9,836 10,582 14,346 17,703 21,239\nNet Profit 1,879 2,076 2,759 3,058 3,372 4,444 6,009\nTotal Assets 65,221 73,796 87,278 99,698 113,792 126,095 141,238\n     Accounts Receivable 1,191 2,982 4,075 4,207 7,342 10,127 12,364\nTo Be Repaid Through Central 0 0 0 3,460 3,157 2,742 2,385\n Appropriation\nLong-Term Debts 39,072 31,189 38,996 47,717 55,905 65,311 73,144\nNet Profit Margin (%) 29.0 25.6 28.1 28.9 23.5 25.1 28.3\nROR on Net Fixed Assets (%) 4.8 4.7 6.1 7.1 5.2 6.8 7.8\nSFR 3-Year Average (%) 27.5 15.7 27.2 22.8 12.8 13.1 22.9\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times) 1.5 2.2 2.4 1.9 1.4 1.1 1.9\nDebt Equity Ratio 44:56 47:53 50:50 53:47 55:45 57:43 55:45\nAccounts Receivable (# months sales) 2.2 5.1 5.8 5.5 7.2 7.8 8.4a\n# Months Sales Excluding Accounts to 2.2 4.4 5 0.8 3.5 5.0 5.6\nbe Repaid Through Central\nAppropriation\nROR = rate of return;  SFR = Special Funds resources.\na  This does not take into account the liquidation of dues of Rs720 million by Uttar Pradesh Power\nCorporation in June 2000.\n87. Powergrid derives its revenues from its transmission services. The current tariff structure\nunder which Powergrid operates was established on 16 December 1997, retroactive to 1 April\n1997. Under the tariff protocol, Powergrid is granted  full recovery of depreciation, interest on\nforeign and domestic borrowings, foreign exchange losses, and taxes on profits generated\nthrough transmission activity. In addition, the tariff includes a provision for interest on working\ncapital, an operation and maintenance (O&M) charge (based on 1.5 percent of the original\ncapital  cost  of  productive  fixed  assets),  a  12  percent  ROE  up  to  31  March  1997,  and  a\n16 percent ROE computed on paid-up capital applicable to transmission assets and any new\ninvestment in transmission projects from internal resources, on or after 1 April 1997. Powergrid\nshould remain profitable, provided its costs remain within the perimeters established by the tariff\nprotocol (i.e. accounts receivable and inventory levels are maintained at suitable levels and\nO&M costs stay within 1.5 percent of capital investment).", "21\n88. While its overall financial performance is sound, Powergrid has some difficulty collecting\naccounts receivable. The collection problems are not systemic, but relate to a limited number of\nfinancially distressed SEBs that do not generate sufficient cash flow to honor their obligations to\nPowergrid.  Recognizing  the  problem,  the Government  approved  in  1997,  the  provision  of\nRs3,460 million over a 10-year period from the central budget. Powergrid received the first\ninstallment of Rs303 million during FY1998; the balance is to be paid out on a variable basis,\nwith a final installment of Rs226 million scheduled for FY2007. Powergrid is taking further steps\nto improve its collection performance. Letters of credit are now mandatory for all client SEBs to\nsupport the timely payment of monthly billings. Further, in FY2001, a substantial portion of the\noutstandings of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have been liquidated\nthrough  the  issue  of  bonds  guaranteed  by  the  respective  state  governments.  To  facilitate\ncompliance by Powergrid of its accounts receivable covenants under the ongoing loan and the\nproposed  loan,  modifications  to  the  same  have  been  incorporated  in  the  respective  loan\nagreements. This will ensure that investments flow to financially responsible utilities.\n89. Powergrid\u2019s  debt  structure  is  summarized  in  Table  4.  Approximately  39  percent  of\nPowergrid\u2019s outstanding long-term debt as of 31 March 2000 has been raised from foreign\nsources and is denominated in a variety of currencies including Canadian dollars, French\nfrancs, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, and US dollars.  While interest rates and maturities on\nforeign  debt  have  been  reasonable,  domestic  debt,  which  accounts  for  61  percent  of\nPowergrid\u2019s debt burden, tends to have significantly higher interest rates and shorter maturities.\nBond issues, which account for slightly more than 25 percent of total borrowings, have been\nstructured with a single repayment mechanism, with 100 percent of the principal being paid in\nthe year of maturity. Powergrid has not maintained a sinking fund for principal repayments.\nThus,  its  cash  flows  and  self-financing  ratios  fluctuate  significantly  between  years.  The\nproposed loan, together with use of ADB\u2019s partial risk guarantee, will help to reduce Powergrid\u2019s\noverall borrowing costs and will facilitate improved cash flow management.\nTable 4: Powergrid's Debt Structure as of 31 March 2000\nTerms (years)\nCurrency Modality Source Balance Interest Grace Maturity\n(Rs million) (%)\nDomestic Loan Domestic Financial Institutions 14,635     13-18 Various 5 - 7\nLoan Government of India 18,580          15 5    15\nBond Various Issues to Domestic Investors 11,483       9-17   bullet 5 - 7\nSubtotal 44,698\nForeign Loan Multilateral Sources 16,677         7-9 5    15\nLoan Bilateral Sources 1,150      3-9.5 Various 5-10\nLoan Commercial Sources 10,619 1.4-6.35 Various 5-10\nSubtotal 28,446\n                  Total 73,144\n90. The  financial  projections  for  Powergrid,  based  on  the  tariff  protocol  discussed  in\npara. 87, indicate strong financial performance over the term of the loan.

Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n91. The Project has been classified as Category B under ADB\u2019s environmental classification\nof projects, and requires that a sample summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) be\ncirculated to the Board. Powergrid prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) and\nSIEE of the sample subproject for the 400 kV double-circuit transmission line extending about\n400 km from Raipur to Rourkela, which is considered as the most environmentally sensitive\ncandidate subproject.  This SIEE was circulated to the Board on 29 July 1998.\n92. Of the total 400 km length of the Raipur-Rourkela transmission line, only 14.25 km will\npass through forested areas (with a density of 0.4) in Orissa State. The affected forest is\nrevenue forest (14.1 km affecting 67.5 hectares [ha]) and plantation forest (0.15 km affecting\n0.7 ha) of minor ecological importance. There are no recorded endangered, threatened, or rare\nspecies of fauna or flora in the affected forest. Traversing this forest could not be avoided due to\nterrain and the presence of the Hirakud reservoir. A 3-meter-wide strip of land will be retained\nas  maintenance  right-of-way.  Powergrid  will  adhere  to  the  Government\u2019s  procedure  for\ncompensation  for  loss  of  trees  and  forested  areas;  hence  there  will  be  a  provision  for\ncompensatory  forestry.  Good  environmental  practices  will  be  followed  to  ensure  minimal\ndisturbance. To further minimize impact, low-canopy seed trees and shrubs will be kept intact as", "23\nlong as they do not interfere with tower erection and line installation. The IEE concluded that\noverall environmental impacts were minor or insignificant because potential impacts associated\nwith transmission lines have been minimized through careful route selection. The project design\n(i) minimizes the need for resettlement; (ii) does not affect monuments of cultural or historical\nimportance; (iii) does not create a threat to the survival of any community, including tribal\ncommunities; (iv) does not affect public places such as playgrounds or schools; (v) does not\npass through any sanctuary, national park, or other protected areas; (vi) minimizes damage to\nexisting forest resources; and (vii) provides for alignments of 10-15 km from major towns to\naccount for future urban expansion.\n93. In 1998, Powergrid adopted a comprehensive company policy on environmental and\nsocial protection titled Environmental and Social Policy and Procedures (ESPP). ADB reviewed\nthe ESPP and found it consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Settlement. During fact-\nfinding and appraisal, similar subprojects executed by Powergrid in the past were examined and\nfound to be acceptable from the viewpoint of environmental and social impact, and mitigation,\nparticularly because of the special care taken by Powergrid and the government agencies in\ndelineating the alignment to avoid dense old growth forest and agricultural land, minimize\nacquisition of rights-of-way, and eschew obtaining borrowed material from agricultural land and\nforests. The field practices of Powergrid are consistent with sound environmental management.\n94.  ADB examined the SIEE reports of the core subprojects under the proposed loan and\nfound the environmental impacts insignificant and the proposed environmental management\nmeasures adequate. Where necessary, required mitigation measures have been incorporated.\nThe details are in Appendix 11. A review of the proposed subprojects, suggests that a full-scale\nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) may not be necessary and an IEE may be adequate for\nidentifying potential impacts and designing environmental management measures. However,\nany subproject confirmed by ADB as environmentally sensitive will require the preparation of an\nEIA or summary EIA (SEIA) which will be submitted to ADB.\n2.  Social Impacts\n95. Since  this is a transmission project, the social impacts\u2014land acquisition and involuntary\nresettlement\u2014are  minimal,  arising  only  for  subprojects  entailing  construction  of  new\nsubstations. Compensation will be required for crop damage caused by tower construction.\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  minimal  since  Powergrid\u2019s  policy  is  to  construct\nsubstations and select route alignments away from built-up areas, utilizing as much as possible\ngovernment-owned  land.  To  date,  Powergrid  projects  have  not  entailed  large-scale  land\nacquisition and resettlement. Of the 55 subprojects entailing land acquisition in the past, only\none homestead was acquired and only a small number of families were affected by land\nacquisition.\n96. Although Powergrid projects have involved minimal land acquisition and resettlement,\nPowergrid has a comprehensive ESPP to address the environmental and social impacts of their\nprojects. Within its organizational structure, Powergrid has also established an environmental\nand social management department within its organizational structure to implement the ESPP.\n97. This is a sector project, and Powergrid has not yet confirmed or approved all subprojects\nat this stage. Details of the precise amount of land to be acquired and the number of affected\nhouseholds are not yet available for all candidate subprojects. For each preliminarily approved\nsubproject  requiring  significant  resettlements,  Powergrid  has  prepared  an  initial  social", "24\nassessment (ISA) detailing the estimates of land acquisition, listing of the affected households,\nand identifying any vulnerable groups such as tribal communities. Of the five core subprojects,\ntwo will not require land acquisition and two, only small amounts. The ISAs were reviewed\nduring project appraisal and the subprojects confirmed to present minimal social impacts. A\nsample ISA for the Kolhapur- Ponda transmission line is summarized in Appendix 12.\n98. For  subprojects  identified  following  loan  approval,  an  ISA  must  be  included  in  the\nsubproject appraisal report. For subprojects that entail involuntary resettlement affecting 40 or\nmore families, a detailed social impact assessment, including a resettlement action plan with\ntime-bound actions and budgets, must be submitted to ADB for review prior to the of physical\nimplementation of the subproject. Powergrid will implement and monitor the resettlement action\nplan in a manner consistent with Powergrid\u2019s ESPP and ADB\u2019s requirements. ADB will monitor\nthe resettlement process through its regular review missions.\n3.  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n99. Benefit monitoring and evaluation of the Project will be done by Powergrid and will be\nreviewed by ADB missions as part of the supervision work. This will include verification of (i) the\nfinancial status of the Project\u2019s beneficiary regions and states, and (ii) improvements in service\nfor the existing consumers in the beneficiary regions. Institutional parameters such as accounts\nreceivable, and systems loss will also be evaluated.\nI.  Technical Assistance\n100. In line with the policy dialogue with the Government regarding private sector participation\nin power transmission and to help Powergrid explore contracting out BOOT projects, ADB has\naccorded  advisory  TA  22  to  assist  Powergrid  to  implement  one  transmission  project,  the\nMadurai-Trivandrum  400  kV  transmission  line,  on  a  BOO/BOT  basis  by  reviewing  the\nGovernment\u2019s procedures and guidelines, developing documents for bidding, and evaluating\nproposals received during the solicitation. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $830,000\nequivalent. ADB is financing $600,000 on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.\nPowergrid is financing the remaining $230,000 equivalent.\nIV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Financial Analysis\n101. The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2000\nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to\nreal terms by removing the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency\nfluctuations. The FIRR was computed for the total Project because of the Project\u2019s integrated\nnature  and  the  practical  difficulties  associated  with  allocating  benefits  and  operating  costs\namong the various subprojects. The subprojects will contribute to the overall strengthening of\nthe power transmission system in India, but they are not stand-alone cost or revenue centers.\n                                                \n22 TA-3380 IND: Private Sector Participation in Electricity Transmission, for $600,000, approved on 28 December\n1999.", "25\n102. The FIRR computed on an after-tax basis, is 7.8 percent. An FIRR of 7.8% in real terms\nequates to a rate of return, in nominal terms of approximately 14%. This is consistent with the\nrate of return of equity stipulated at 16%. The FIRR compares favorably with the WACC, also\ncomputed on an after-tax basis, of 5.1 percent. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is\nrobust under adverse conditions. The tariff protocol, described in para. 87, allows for full pass-\nthrough of any foreign exchange loss on the foreign currency-denominated debt. Normal levels\nof  devaluation,  based  on  the  differential  between  domestic  and  international  inflation\nprojections,  have  been  incorporated  into  the  financial  projections.  Sensitivity  to  further\ndevaluation was analyzed given the provisions of the tariff protocol. The sensitivity analysis is\nsummarized in Table 6 and the detailed financial evaluation is in Appendix 13.\nTable 6: Sensitivity Analysis\nFIRR WACC\nScenario ( % )  ( % )\nBase Case 7.8 5.1\nOne year Construction Delay 6.8 5.1\n10 Percent Increase in Project Cost 6.6 5.4\n10 Percent Decrease in Tariffs 6.2 5.1\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return,   WACC = weighted average cost of capital.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n103. The proposed sector loan will finance a number of separate subprojects, which will be\nevaluated  individually  before  final  approval  by  ADB  to  ensure  that  they  are  (i)  technically\nfeasible, (ii) the least-cost alternative, and (iii) economically viable with an economic internal\nrate of return (EIRR) of at least 12 percent. Five subprojects have been identified for the first\nbatch of appraisal activity; three are generation-linked schemes while the remaining two are\ngrid-strengthening activities.  Economic analysis was undertaken for all subprojects.  Details of\nthe analysis are in Appendix 14; a summary is in the following paragraphs and in Table 7.\nTable 7: Economic Internal Rates of Return of Subprojects\nSubproject EIRR (%) NPV (Rs million)\nPart A.

The Raipur-Rourkela transmission line is a critical investment to establish a reliable and\nsecure east-west interconnector for the country.  The present capacity of direct interconnection\nbetween the eastern and western regions is limited and allows for only suboptimal use of", "26\nexisting generating facilities in the eastern region.  Interconnection between the two regions is a\nstrategic investment for creating a national grid, since it permits future transmission links to the\nnorthern and southern regions.\n105. The western region is suffering a deficit of about 2,000 MW during peak hours and is\ncurrently importing up to 400-450 MW of power from the eastern region, which has a surplus of\nabout 1,500 MW. This generation surplus is expected to increase further in the medium term.  In\naddition, power from neighboring countries like Bhutan and Nepal will also be imported to the\neastern region for onward transfer to other deficit regions of the Indian grid.\n106.  Two thirds of power transferred through the Raipur-Rourkela line is allocated to Gujarat\nand Madhya Pradesh, while the state of Maharashtra will receive the other one third according\nto a formula specified by the CEA. Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are two of ADB\u2019s focal states,\nwhich are in the process of undertaking far-reaching reforms in government finances and their\nrespective  power  sectors.  In  addition  to  the  public  resource  management  program  loans\napproved for Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh 23 ADB is currently preparing power sector reform\ninterventions in both states. The east-west Interconnector will help ensure that Gujarat and\nMadhya Pradesh can improve the delivery of power supply to their customers at lower costs\nand  thereby  maintain  and  reinforce  the  momentum  and  support  for  power  sector  reform.\nPowergrid\u2019s  alignment  of  its  investment  program  to  directly  support  state  power  reform\nprograms is a critical complement to ADB\u2019s state-level activities and underlines the policy\nconcept of targeting investments in central sector agencies,which promote state sector reforms.\nThe EIRR calculated on the basis of 675 million additional units of power is 23 percent.\n107. The Kolhapur-Ponda subproject is dedicated to serve the small coastal state of Goa,\nwhich does not have generating capacity of its own. Goa, located in the extreme far west of the\nwestern  region,  depends  fully  on  power  transfers  through  one  220  kV  double-circuit  line\ntraversing Maharashtra, the state\u2019s only neighbor in the western region. Given the overloading\nof this line and the fact that the line is also tapped at two substations in Maharashtra, Goa is not\nin a position to draw its full share of central sector generation capacity from the grid. The current\nshortfall  is  approximately  90  MW.  The  proposed  400  kV  line  will  enable  Goa  to  draw  its\nmaximum allocation from the western grid. In addition, the subproject will lead to other benefits,\nsuch as the ability to service the future load growth in Goa and parts of Maharashtra and to\nincrease the reliability of power supply to those areas.\n108. The  second  major  quantified  economic  benefit  associated  with  the  Kolhapur-Ponda\nsubproject is a reduction in transmission loss of about 40 MW compared with the 220 kV\nalternative. Least-cost analysis by Powergrid showed that the higher capital cost of the 400 kV\nline is easily compensated by the savings in annual incremental energy loss. The EIRR of the\nsubproject is estimated at 23 percent.\n109. As  the  new  transmission  lines  are  linked  to  the  existing  generating  capacity,  only\nincremental  economic  sent-out  costs  were  taken  into  account  in  the  economic  evaluation.\nA similar approach was taken with regard to incremental distribution cost. The limiting factor in\ndrawing  a  full  share  of  allocated  central  generation  is  insufficient  intra  and  interregional\ntransmission capacity; thus, it is assumed that no new distribution investment is required, and\nthat  the  existing  distribution  network  in  each  beneficiary  state  is  sufficient  to  absorb  the\nadditional energy. Given the size of the states and the amount of incremental energy used in the\n                                                \n23 Loan IND-1506 Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program, for $250 million, approved on 18 December\n1996; and Loan 1707-IND: Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program, for $250 million, approved on\n14 December 1999.", "27\neconomic evaluation this assumption appears reasonable.  Consequently, only additional costs\nfor the distribution network were included in the calculation.\n110. The incremental economic benefits were estimated based on the value of the power\nsupply to the final consumers, calculated separately for the major consumer categories in each\nstate benefiting from the new transmission lines, after deducting for auxiliary consumption, and\ntransmission and distribution losses.\nb.  Generation-Linked Schemes\n111. NTPC is expanding three of its gas-fired generation facilities at Anta in Rajasthan State,\nand Gandhar and Kawas in Gujarat State. These facilities are to be constructed within the\npremises of already existing plants, making extensive use of facilities on site and rights-of-way\nto achieve economies of scale. The alternative would have been to build coal-fired power\nstations and to transport the coal from far-off mines. However, NTPC determined in 1993 that\ntransporting the high-ash coal available in India beyond 400 km is uneconomical and also leads\nto environmental problems related to disposal of the residual ash especially in populated areas.\n112. While the power evacuation project associated with the Anta-II generation project is in\nthe northern region, those associated with the Kawas-II and Gandhar-II generation projects are\nin the western region. The general approach used to evaluate transmission lines linked to new\ngeneration plants is to compare the total incremental economic cost of generation, transmission\nfrom and distribution with the incremental economic benefits. The benefits are estimated on the\nvalue of the power supply to the final consumers, calculated separately for the major consumer\ncategories  in  each  state  supplied  by  the  new  power  plants,  after  deducting  for  auxiliary\nconsumption, and transmission and distribution losses.  Sent-out costs per kWh from the new\ngeneration plants were taken from the respective feasibility studies and were adjusted to reflect\neconomic costs.\n113. The three power plants are all designed to use natural gas as well as naphtha and the\nfeasibility studies ran calculations for sent-out costs for both types of fuel. Use of natural gas in\nthe plants depends on the development of gas terminals, and Memorandum of Understanding\nfor the construction of two terminals dedicated to serve the three plants were signed in early\n2000. The terminals are expected to come into operation by end-2003, which is approximately\nsix  months  after  the  construction  of  the  power  plants  will  be  completed.  In  the  economic\nevaluation of the transmission projects, variable sent-out costs were calculated on the basis of a\nliquefied natural gas (LNG) price of $4 per million Btu. However, for the first year of the plants\noperations, it was assumed that indigenous naphtha would be used at a cost of Rs17,000\n($382) per ton.\n114. Associated investments in distribution facilities to utilize the incremental power from the\nnew power stations had been assumed for states that are allocated more than 100 MW. For\nstates with allocations below 100 MW, it was assumed that this incremental power will be\nutilized to offset the current power-supply shortages. Therefore only incremental O&M cost\nrelated to distribution services were assumed.\n115. The EIRRs were estimated to be 36 percent for Anta-II, 24 percent for Kawas-II, and\n28 percent for Gandhar-II.\n116. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for all subprojects. The details are in Appendix 14.", "28\n3.  Risks\n117. The Project involves no major risk. Powergrid is required to provide internally generated\nfunds to finance 20 percent of the project cost. The risk of shortfall in this is low because its\nfunds resources are expected to be comfortably above this requirement from FY2000 onward.\nAlso, since the project expenditure forms only part of Powergrid\u2019s capital expenditure program,\nthe Project will be given priority. From Powergrid\u2019s past performance, especially in the ongoing\nloan,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  risks  are  minimal.  Since  all  foreign  exchange\nfluctuations are a pass-through to the transmission service tariff, the only risk would arise from\ndelays in tariff increase. However, the establishment of CERC minimizes this risk. Demand risk\nis minimal since the national construction program is planning for shortages, even after its\ncompletion. If demand growth is lower than that assumed, the satisfaction level will increase. In\nany case the identified subprojects are part of the least-cost solutions, and therefore  will always\nenjoy priority over other investments in transmission.  The only risk arises from the deferment of\nthe construction of the generation projects of NTPC to which these transmission systems are\nlinked. This risk has been mitigated by delaying subproject implementation until a reasonable\nlevel of commitment has been received from NTPC. The EIRR of the Project has been tested\nfor delays of up to two years for completion of the generation facilities and has been found to be\nrobust.\nB.  Environment\n118. The transmission subprojects and the implementation of the availability tariff will reduce\nthe total output of pollutants from power plants by enforcing the optimal use of generation\nfacilities through (i) a tariff structure that ensures economical load dispatching wherein least-\ncost hydropower and efficient thermal plants have the highest position in the merit order;\n(ii) transferring electricity from one regional grid to another to benefit from the diversity in peak\ndemand hours and optimizing the interregional use of power plants; and (iii) reducing demands\nto transport coal with a very high ash content on the overloaded railroad systems, which will\nlead to environmental benefits from reduced ash disposal. Energy resources will be saved by\nreducing  transmission  losses,  improving  voltage  and  frequency,  and  decreasing  system\noverloading. The availability of improved power supply will reduce the use of uneconomical\ncaptive power generation.\nC.  Social Dimensions\n119. The Project will benefit industrial, commercial, residential, and agriculture customers\nthroughout India. It will allow India to supply electricity to additional households and to have a\nmore reliable supply of power. By inducing industrial and commercial activity, the Project will\ncreate  more  job  opportunities  and  improve  productivity  and  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the\nmanufacturing sector.\nD.  Poverty Reduction\n120. The Indian economy needs to grow by about 7 percent per annum to significantly reduce\npoverty  over  the  next  20  years.  Availability  of  low-cost  reliable  power  is  one  of  the  key\nrequirements  for  such  growth.  By  supporting  provision  of  low-cost  power,  the  Project  is\ncontributing to pro-poor growth in the country.", "29\nE.  Information Technology\n121. Several of the transmission lines being financed by ADB's ongoing loan and the Project\nhave optic fibre cores incorporated in their earth wires. This has opened up possibilities of\nimproving communications in India through leasing of these optic fiber cores. Powergrid is\nworking with telecom companies to commercialize this asset. The first of such high capacity\nlinks between New Delhi and Chandigarh was inaugurated on 2 August 2000.\nV.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Prior Actions by the Government and Powergrid\n122. In order to obtain the commitment of the Government and Powergrid for implementation\nof sector reform and the proposed loan, the following key actions were undertaken prior to the\nloan negotiations:\na)  Powergrid submitted subproject appraisal reports to ADB, with the total cost of\nthe subprojects exceeding 50 percent of the total Project cost;\nb) Powergrid has identified the Vizag-Vijayawada 400kV transmission project for\nprivate sector participation under ADB\u2019s TA;\nc) CERC has issued orders for the time-bound implementation of availability based\ntariff.

Interregional Link Strengthening between East and West Regions\n (first batch, sample IEE subproject)\n1. Surplus power in the eastern region is approximately 1,000 megawatt (MW). Currently,\nsurplus power up to 500 MW is being transferred to other regions on radial AC transmission\nlines  or,  in  the  near  future,  high  voltage  direct  current  (HVDC)  systems.  The  proposed\nsubproject intends to install the first AC interconnection through synchronous link between the\neastern and western regions. The proposed AC synchronous interconnection has the following\nadvantages compared with HVDC interconnection.\n(i)  It is far more economical than HVDC link for the same transfer capacity and more\nflexible for future expansion.\n(ii)  The strong system stability of the western region can strengthen the system\nstability of the eastern region.\n(iii)  System frequency will be improved due to the larger synchronized system.\n(iv)  Postdisturbance  system  frequency  deviation  and  system  instability  will  be\ndecreased by the larger synchronized system\n(v)  Load dispatch will be optimal because more economic reserve power will be\nshared by  both regions.\n2.  The scope of work of the proposed subproject is as follows:\n(i)  Rourkela \u2013 Raipur 400 kilovolt (kV) double-circuit (D/C) transmission line (400\nkilometers [km])\n(ii)  Bay extensions at Rourkela and Raipur\nA-2. Grid Strengthening for Goa (First Batch)\n3. Goa receives substantial share of its power from the central sector generating stations in\nwestern region through Kolhapur \u2013 Ponda 220 kV D/C line which is inadequate to transfer the\nfull share of Goa from the rest of the western region. Moreover, voltage level at the Goa end is a\nvery low level of about 170 kV at 220 kV bus bar, especially at the peak demand time. Taking\ninto account the load growth in Goa and above constraints, it is proposed to install a direct\n400 kV link to the existing 220 kV Goa system. Additional power supply for future load growth\nwith improved reliability is expected in addition to transmission loss reduction.\n4.

Interconnection Strengthening between India and Bangladesh\n(second batch)\n6. The eastern region of India has surplus power round the year and it shares the boundary\nwith the west zone of Bangladesh, which has power deficit. An interconnection between the\neastern region of India and the west zone of Bangladesh can facilitate the transfer of power to\nBangladesh. Similarly, an interconnection between the east zone of Bangladesh and the north-\neast region of India will enable Bangladesh to supply power to India.\n7. The scope of work is as follows:\n(i)  Krishnanagar/Baharampur (India) \u2013 Ishurdi (Bangladesh) 220 kV D/C\n transmission line (45 km)\n(ii)  Kumarghat (India) \u2013 Shahjibazar (Bangladesh) 220 kV D/C transmission Line\n(40 km)\n(iii)  New 400/220 kV Substation at Krishnanagar with 315 MVA Auto Transformer\n(iv)  Bay extension at 132 kV Kumarghat\nPart B: Generation Linked Schemes\nB-1. Kawas-II Transmission System (first batch)\n8. Output  power  of  the  existing  Kawas-I  (650  MW)  is  evacuated  by  three  220  kV\ntransmission systems. Because of severe constraint of the right-of-way around Kawas, the\nproposed subproject will install 400 kV transmission system to evacuate Kawas-II (additional\n650 MW). Furthermore, a new 400 kV substation (Valsad) will be installed in the southern part\nof Gujarat with overall network enhancement. This subproject will result in more reliable and\nadditional power supply to southern Gujarat and transmission loss reduction.\n9. The scope of work is as follows:\n(i)  Kawas-Valsad 400 kV D/C transmission line (125 km)\n(ii)  LILO of Gandhar-Padge 400 kV S/C line at new Valsad substation (15 km)\n(iii)  New 400/220 kV substation at Valsad with 2X315 MVA Auto Transformers\nB-2. Gandhar-II Transmission System  (first batch)\n10. Along with the installation of Gandhar-II (additional 650 MW), Gujarat Electricity Board\nwill  install a  new  400 kV  substation  at Kasor  to supply power to  major load  centers in  north", "46\nAppendix 4, page 3\nGujarat. The existing 200 kV line from Gandhar to Haldawara is sometimes overloaded. The\nproposed subproject intends to install direct connection between Gandhar and Kasor and to\nresolve the overload in the existing system.\n11. The scope of work is as follows:\n(i)  Gandhar (NTPC) - Mobha 220 kV D/C transmission line (50 km)\n(ii)  LILO of Gandhar-Dehgam 400 kV D/C transmission line at Kasor (25 km)\nB-3. Anta-II Transmission System  (first batch)\n12. Output power of the existing Anta-I (413 MW) is evacuated by four 220 kV transmission\nlines. Because of the load growth of Beawar and Ajmer areas, direct power transfer from Anta to\nBeawar by 400 kV transmission lines is preferable after expansion of Anta-II (additional 650\nMW) to improve system reliability and to reduce transmission loss. In addition, the proposed\nsubproject will conserve the right-of-way around Anta.\n13. The scope of work is as follows:\n(i)  Anta-Beawar 400 kV D/C transmission line (200 km)\n(ii)  New 400/220 kV substation at Beawar with 2X315 MVA auto transformers\nB-4. Ramagundam-III Transmission System  (second batch)\n14. The output power of the existing Ramagundam (2,100 MW) power station is evacuated\nby  five  400  kV  transmission  lines.  The  lines  remain  critically  loaded  most  of  the  time.\nConstraints in power transmission have been experienced very often, especially during summer\nand winter, compounded by the low-voltage conditions of the system. The proposed subproject\nwill provide an additional 400 kV power evacuation line for the expansion of Ramagundam (500\nMW) and result in a more reliable power supply to the southern region.\n15. The scope of work is as follows:\n(i)  Ramagundam \u2013 Hyderabad 400 kV D/C transmission line (200 km)\n(ii)  Bay extension at Hyderabad (Powergrid)\nB-5. Tala Transmission System (second batch)\n16. The Tala hydropower project (1,020 MW) is being developed by the Royal Government\nof Bhutan with assistance from the Government of India. Tala Hydro Power Authority, an\nautonomous body, is executing the project. A large quantum of power from this project is\nplanned to be transferred to India. The proposed subproject intends to transfer the generated\npower through the eastern region and then further to the northern region, which suffers power\ndeficit.  Possibility  of  transfer  of  part  of  this  power  to  Bangladesh  can  also  be  considered\nsubsequently.\n17. The scope of work is as follows:\n(i)  Bay extensions at Siliguri, Purnea, Gorakhpur, and Lucknow\n(ii)  New 400/200 kV substation at Muzaffarpur.", "47\nAppendix 5\nCOST ESTIMATES OF THE CANDIDATE SUBPROJECTS\nForeign Local Costs Total\nProject Component Cost (Rs. millions) ($ millions Cost\n($ million) equivalent) ($ million)\nPart A: Grid Strengthening Schemes (First Batch) \nA-1 Inter-regional Link Strengthening (East-West, \n400 kV D/C Raipur-Rourkela)\nBase Cost 43.85 625.70 12.88 56.73\nPhysical Contingencies 4.39 62.56 1.29 5.68\nPrice Contingencies 2.91 79.65 1.60 4.51\nIDC 10.36 110.27 2.19 12.55\nTotal Cost 61.51 878.18 17.96 79.47\nA-2 Grid Strengthening for Goa (400 kV D/C Kolhapur-Ponda)\nBase Cost 29.47 536.74 11.19 40.66\nPhysical Contingencies 2.95 53.68 1.12 4.07\nPrice Contingencies 1.96 66.65 1.36 3.32\nIDC 6.95 127.73 2.50 9.45\nTotal Cost 41.33 784.80 16.17 57.50\nPart B: Generation Linked Schemes (First Batch)\nB-1 Kawas-II (650 MW) Transmission System (NTPC, Gujarat)\nBase Cost 17.71 411.89 8.55 26.26\nPhysical Contingencies 1.77 41.19 0.86 2.63\nPrice Contingencies 1.17 47.36 0.96 2.13\nIDC 4.19 109.76 2.14 6.33\nTotal Cost 24.84 610.20 12.51 37.35\nB-2 Gandhar-II (650 MW) Transmission System (NTPC, Gujarat)\nBase Cost 10.43 133.83 2.75 13.18\nPhysical Contingencies 1.04 13.38 0.28 1.32\nPrice Contingencies 0.69 15.46 0.31 1.00\nIDC 2.46 21.52 0.42 2.88\nTotal Cost 14.62 184.19 3.76 18.38\nB-3 Anta-II (650MW) Transmission System (NTPC, Rajasthan)\nBase Cost 30.23 498.52 10.33 40.56\nPhysical Contingencies 3.02 49.85 1.03 4.05\nPrice Contingencies 2.02 53.23 1.08 3.10\nIDC 7.04 69.95 1.36 8.40\nTotal Cost 42.31 671.55 13.80 56.11\nIDC = interest during construction;  NTPC = National Thermal Power Corporation Limited", "48\nAppendix 6, page 1\nMAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE COMMERCIAL COFINANCING\nAND ESTIMATED GUARANTEE FEES SCHEDULE\nBorrower Power Grid Corporation of India Limited\nGuarantors ADB in the form of a partial credit guarantee (Guarantee) covering the\nperiod  specified  below.

Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) is a limited-liability company\nincorporated in October 1989 under the Companies Act of 1956. It is a national transmission\nutility  responsible  for  evacuating  power  from  central  power  plants  and  for  developing  and\noperating transmission facilities to enable power interchange among state electricity boards\nboth within and between regions.\n2. Powergrid has a total authorized capital of Rs50 billion, comprising of 50 million shares\nwith a par value of Rs1,000 per share. As of 31 March 2000, 28,886,540 shares had been\nissued for a total paid-up and subscribed capital of Rs30,495 million (including a share capital\ndeposit of Rs1,609 million). Powergrid is 100 percent owned by the Government of India.\nB.  Past Financial Performance\n3. Powergrid commenced commercial operations in August 1991 and has been profitable\nin each year with the exception of the first partial year of operations. Since 31 March 1993,\nsales have grown at an average rate of 18 percent per annum, with net profit increasing by\napproximately 9 percent per annum. Total operating expenses have been less than 11 percent\nof net fixed assets.\n4. Powergrid has maintained positive cash flow from operations. Continued expansion has\nbeen  financed  partially  through  internally  generated  funds,  equity  contributions  from  the\nGovernment, and a combination of short-, medium-, and long-term debt.\n5. While maintaining a positive cash flow and a relatively strong balance sheet, Powergrid\nis facing some difficulty with collecting accounts receivable. Accounts receivable amounted to\n8.4 months of sales at the end of FY2000. The Asian Development Bank's loan covenant\nstipulated that accounts receivable should represent no more than 2.0 months of sales. The\nGovernment has approved a provision of Rs3,460 million as central appropriation to Powergrid\nto liquidate the outstanding accounts receivable as of 31 March 1997. Rs1,075 million had been\nreceived as of 31 March 2000, and the balance of Rs2,385 million will be received over the next\nseven years.  After taking into account the component of accounts receivable to be paid through\nthe  central  appropriation,  the  adjusted  accounts  receivable  balance  as  of  31  March  2000\nrepresents 5.6 months sales.\nC.  Financial Projections\n1.  General\n6. The effect of the proposed Project on the financial position of Powergrid has been\nreflected in the projected financial statements. Projections were prepared on a nominal basis\nbased on major assumptions outlined in the following paragraphs.\n7. Domestic inflation rates were assumed to be 6.5 percent while international inflation\nrates were assumed to be 2.4 percent throughout the projections from the year ending 31 March\n2001.", "56\nAppendix 10, page 2\n2.  Revenues\n8. Primary sources of revenue for Powergrid will be transmission tariffs and the sale of\nelectricity. In addition, Powergrid will continue to provide nominal project management services\nand generate a limited amount of revenue through sale of services and documentation for\ncontracts, bidding documents, and other miscellaneous sources (Table A 4.1).\na.  Transmission Revenue\n9. Powergrid's transmission tariff is defined by F. No. 2/3/Powergrid/Tariff/97, the tariff\nprotocol passed by the Government of India's Ministry of Power on 16 December 1997 with\neffect from 1 April 1997.  According to the notification, the tariff structure includes the following\ncomponents:\n(i)  16 percent return on the deemed equity portion of transmission assets as of\n31 March  1997.    For  purposes  of  computation,  this  has  been  defined  as\n50 percent of net book value of fixed assets as of 31 March 1997.\n(ii)  16 percent return on equity as of 31 March 1997 (less deemed equity defined in\n(i) plus the self-financed portion of annual capital expansion.\n(iii)  Full  recovery  of  depreciation,  interest  on  foreign  and  domestic  borrowings,\ninterest on bonds, foreign exchange losses, and taxes on profits earned from\ntransmission activities.\n(iv)  Interest on working capital, based on 2 months sales in accounts receivable, one\nmonth\u2019s operating and maintenance expenditure, and a spares provision based\non 1 percent of fixed assets. Interest on working capital charged at the rate of\n17 percent per annum.\n(v)  A provision for operating and maintenance expenditure based on 1.5 percent of\nthe  original  value  of  fixed  assets,  adjusted  annually  to  reflect  the  impact  of\ndomestic inflation.\n10. Based on the above, the annual tariffs are assumed as in Table A10.1\nTable A10.1: Annual Tariffs\nRs Million\nItem 2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 \u2026 2019/20\nReturn on deemed capital 3,439 3,439 3,439 3,439 3,439 3,439 3,439 3,439\nReturn on share capital 2,240 3,365 4,335 5,498 6,836 9,243 10,408 21,322\nDepreciation 6,707 7,805 8,837 10,106 11,570 13,697 13,959 21,342\nInterest 7,053 6,511 6,307 5,925 9,829 10,770 12,432 16,860\nForeign exchange loss 635 1,754 2,876 4,192 4,850 5,317 5,123 1,528\nTaxes 0 718 930 1,089 1,287 1,495 1,882 17,144\nInterest on working capital 582 621 635 721 824 970 1,069 3,036\nOperation  &  maintenance 3,247 3,833 4,457 5,197 6,052 7,150 7,886 25,223\nprovision\n23,903 28,046 31,816 36,167 44,687 52,081 56,198 109,894", "57\nAppendix 10, page 3\nb.

Since this transmission line is\nconstructed exclusively for transferring power from Western grid to Goa state the population of\nentire Goa is going to be benefited.\nIdentify and quantify the subgroups, within the client population (e.g. industrial consumers,\nresidential consumers, electric co-operatives etc) which are likely to have different needs and\ndemands.\n \n Not applicable, since Powergrid\u2019s role is restricted only to transmission of bulk power from\ngenerating station to different load center and further distribution of available power is taken up\nby concerned SEBs.\n \nB. Clientele Demands\nAssess the ability and willingness of the major consumer groups to pay tariffs for electricity\nwhich are needed to sustain the operations of the facilities.\nThe project is regional in nature and all the constituents of Western Region decided in the\nstanding committee meeting of Power System Planning in Western Region arranged by CEA on\n18th  July  1998  at  Mumbai,  that  all  the  beneficiaries  of  Western  Region  will  share  the\ntransmission tariff.\n   C. Potential Adverse Impacts\nDetermine if some groups of people will have to be relocated according to the power generation,\ntransmission or distribution plan (e.g from dam sites, thermal power sites, rights-of-way).\nAs per the existing Indian laws, land for right-of-way (ROW) of a transmission line is not\nacquired.  As such there is no resettlement and rehabilitation involved in transmission line\nconstruction works.  However, for the proposed new substation at  Mapusa in Goa State, 30.34\nhectare land is being acquired that may affect about 17 people.\nDetermine if the project will cause the loss of farmland, grazing land, forests streams or\ngroundwater  which supply local livelihoods, provide food or water sources.\nFor the proposed new  substation near Mapusa a total of 30.34 ha. Of land in village Colvale,\nBardez Taluka, Mapusa district, has been selected and acquired after analysis of 4-5 different\nsites by the Committee constituted by the Government of Goa. The proposed land is located at\napproximately 6 km. from Mapusa and 25 km from the state capital Panjim, on the National\nhighway # 17.  Most of  the land  i.e. 27.56 ha.  (90%) is  government  land under  the control  of", "65\nAppendix 12, page 2\nComunidade and rest 2.77 ha (10%) is private land.

The land is barren and\ndoes not come under the category of ancestral burial ground or ritual sites of indigenous people.\nDetails assessment of the impact of acquisition as per the provisions of ESPP is under progress\nfor preparation of management plan to address any adverse affect.\nDetermine how pricing policies would affect the distribution of and access to project benefits by\npoor clients. Assess the ability of client groups who are defined as poor to afford a basic level of\nservice; identify financing measures which  are affordable for the poor groups on a sustainable\nbasis.\nDetailed social assessment for preparation of management plan (SAMP) is under progress as\nper  the provision of ESPP  which will include measures to be adopted for minimizing the likely\nimpact of land acquisition.\nPrepare a socio-economic profile for each group which would be adversely affected and\ndescribe and quantity the impact(s) on the  affected group.\nAs per the ESPP whenever affected families are more than 40, a detailed socio-economic\nsurvey of the proposed area is undertaken by the outside agency for making a detailed socio-\neconomic profile. However, if the affected families are less than 40, Social Assessment and\nManagement Plan (SAMP) is prepared by Powergrid in-house.  Since in the instant case the\nnumber of affected families are far below the limit i.e. 40, Powergrid has already taken the\ninitiative to prepare Social Assessment and Management Plan (SAMP) in consultation with the\nState Authority.  This will be in place within 60-90 days and will be implemented along with the\nproject execution.", "66\nAppendix 13, page 1\nFINANCIAL EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT\nA.  General\n1. The financial evaluation of the Project was carried out in real terms. The Project cost\nestimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by removing\nthe effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations.\nB.  Financial Internal Rate of Return\n2. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated on a total project basis. Each\nof  the  subprojects  will  act  to  strengthen  the  overall  power  transmission  system  in  India,\nhowever, not one will operate in a stand-alone fashion. Given the practical difficulties associated\nwith arbitrarily allocating specific costs and benefits to individual subprojects, the analysis was\ncompleted on an incremental basis for Powergrid with and without the various subprojects.\n3. The FIRR was calculated for a 20-year period (to coincide with the terms of the Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB's) loan) on an after-tax basis (Table A 13.1) with a residual value of\n5% of capital investment cost.\nTable A13.1: FIRR Calculation\n(Rs Million)\nFiscal Capital Incremental Residual\nYear Investment Inflows Outflows value Net\n2000/01 (2,150) (2,150)\n2001/02 (5,913) (5,913)\n2002/03 (6,812) (6,812)\n2003/04 (3,989) (3,989)\n2004/05 (2,317) (2,317)\n2005/06 2,937 (128) 2,809\n2006/07 3,840 (457) 3,383\n2007/08 4,091 (816) 3,275\n2008/09 4,089 (902) 3,187\n2009/10 3,978 (906) 3,072\n2010/11 3,839 (887) 2,952\n2011/12 3,706 (864) 2,842\n2012/13 3,577 (839) 2,738\n2013/14 3,446 (812) 2,634\n2014/15 3,322 (786) 2,536\n2015/16 3,198 (760) 2,438\n2016/17 3,089 (738) 2,351\n2017/18 3,001 (720) 2,281\n2018/19 2,916 (705) 2,211\n2019/20 2,836 (689) 1,059 3,206\nFIRR 7.8%\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return", "67\nAppendix 13, page 2\nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n4. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was calculated in real terms based on the\nfollowing capital structure (Table A 13.2).\nTable A13.2: Financing Plan\n(Rs Million)\nItem Project\nCost\nADB loan 13,401\nForeign Commercial Borrowings 6,426\nDomestic Commercial Borrowings 807\nPowergrid Internal Resources 5,194\nTotal 25,828\nADB = Asian Development Bank\n5. The cost of foreign debt was been calculated based on an interest rate of 6.8 percent\napplicable to ADB's loan with a Government of India guarantee fee of 1.2, an interest rate of\n7.75 percent on foreign commercial borrowings, an income tax rate of 30 percent per annum,\nand an international inflation rate of 2.4 percent per annum. The cost of foreign debt took into\nconsideration  the  commitment  fee,  guarantee  fees  and  front-end  fees  applied  to  foreign\nborrowings. On this basis, and using an average outstanding loan balance of approximately\n$173.6 million over the life of the loans, the cost of foreign debt capital, in real terms was\ncomputed to be 4.1 percent.\n6. The  cost  of  domestic  debt  was  been  calculated  based  on  an  interest  rate  of\n13.5 percent, an income tax rate of 30 percent per annum and an average domestic inflation\nrate of 6.5 percent per annum. On this basis, and using an average outstanding loan balance of\napproximately Rs407million over the life of the loan, the cost of domestic debt capital was\ncomputed to be 3.6 percent.\n7. The cost of Powergrid internal resources was based on an imputed opportunity cost of\ncapital to the Government of India, POWERGRID\u2019s sole shareholder. The opportunity cost of\nequity, in real terms was computed as follows (Table A 13.3):\nTable A 13.3: Financial Cost of Equity in Real Terms\n(Rs million)\nItem Cost of\nEquity (%)\nCurrent interest rate on fixed term deposits 13.00\nPlus risk premium 3.00\nFinancial cost of equity in nominal terms 16.00\nAverage domestic inflation rate 6.5\nFinancial cost of equity in real terms 8.9", "68\nAppendix 13, page 3\n8.

Conclusion\n9. The FIRR is expected to be 7.8 percent compared to the projected WACC of 5.1 percent\n(both computed on an after-tax basis). Considering that the main objective of the Project is to\nstrengthen  the  power  transmission  system  in  India,  the  financial  performance  is  deemed\nacceptable.", "69\nAppendix 14, page 1\nECONOMIC EVALUATION OF APPROVED SUBPROJECTS\n1. The results of economic evaluation for the first five subprojects are summarized in the\nfollowing paragraphs. Details for the Kawas- II and the Raipur-Rourkela sub-projects are shown\nin Tables A 14.1 and A 14.2. Results of the sensitivity analysis for all five subprojects are given\nin Tables A 14.3 and A 14.4.\nA. Economic Benefits\n2. Base data and assumptions used with respect to the estimation of economic benefits\nwere alike for all subprojects.  Economic benefits were calculated for the four major consumer\nsegments: domestic, commercial, industrial, and agriculture.\n3. Each subproject was analyzed as to which states would benefit from the incremental\npower supply at what proportion. Economic benefits were then calculated separately for each\nstate and consumer segment.\n4. The shares of electricity supply assumed to replace an alternative energy source in each\nconsumer category are the following: 10 percent for domestic, 50 percent for commercial and\nindustrial,  and  20  percent  for  agriculture.  The  economic  benefit  of  fuel  substitution  is  the\nresulting economic resource cost saving, that is, the economic cost of alternative energy that\nthe country saves by using electricity.\n5. The shares of incremental electricity supply corresponding to induced consumption are\n90  percent  for  domestic,  50  percent  for  commercial  and  industrial,  and  80  percent  for\nagriculture. Induced consumption was valued by estimating the consumer\u2019s willingness to pay\nfor this part of incremental electricity supply and adding the related consumer surplus benefits to\nthe tariff-based revenues.\n6. Alternative  sources  of  power  used  by  the  four  major  consumer  segments  were\ndetermined and their respective costs were estimated.  It was found that the dominant source of\nalternative power in the domestic sector is kerosene lamps.  Urban domestic consumers use\nLPG lights (Petromax) and candles in addition to kerosene lamps. Rural domestic consumers\nrely almost entirely on kerosene lamps. Private ownership of small and medium-size diesel\ngenerators is very low and is prevalent only among high-income  consumers. Roughly around\n50 percent of total end-consumption of alternative sources of power in the domestic sector is for\nlighting  purposes.  In  the  rural  areas,  these  numbers  are  considerably  higher  due  to  the\nsignificantly lower ownership of electrical appliances. Thus, during power cuts, substitution for\nelectricity  is  almost  exclusively  for  lighting  purposes.  Therefore,  economic  benefits  for  the\ndomestic sector were calculated only for 50 percent of total domestic consumption.\n7. This  50  percent  share  was  allocated  over  three  to  four  alternative  energy  sources\ndepending  on  the  state.  For  example,  while  it  can  be  expected  that  about  5  percent  of\ncustomers in Gujarat and Maharastha own small diesel generators, this is highly unlikely to be\nthe  case  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  Therefore,  only  kerosene  lamps,  inverters,  and  kerosene\ngenerator sets were used for calculating alternative energy cost in Madhya Pradesh. However,\nthe  assumed  percentage of  ownership of these  three alternative  energy forms varies  with\nthe economic profile of each state. Induced consumption was valued using the willingness-to-\npay method plus the related consumer surplus with a curvature factor of 0.3.\n8. Commercial sector use of alternative sources of power also differs between urban and\nrural areas.  While in the urban areas the commercial sector uses a mix of small diesel\ngenerators, petromax, and kerosene lamps, in the  rural area kerosene lamps and  candles are", "70\nAppendix 14, page 2\ndominant.  However, the large commercial sector segment shows user  patterns more similar to\nthose small and medium-size industries. Typically, hotels, hospitals, office complexes, and\nuniversities would be considered large commercial sector. Alternative generation sets vary in\nsize from 10 kVA to 500 kVA.  The average economic cost of alternative energy sources for\ncommercial establishments has been estimated at Rs6.3 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for a 75- kVA\ngenerator.\n9. In agriculture the only possible power alternative is generators as electric power is a\nnecessity for operating irrigation pumps. The economic cost of alternative energy sources was\nthe estimated to be around Rs5.3 per kWh.\n10. The  industry  sector  has  a  large  percentage  of  alternative  sources  of  energy.  For\nexample, in the state of Orissa installed captive generation capacity is 600 megawatts (MW),\nwhich is 50 percent higher than the amount of sales to industry by the local power utilities.\nCaptive power facilities cover a wide range of unit size and plant types, with the most dominant\nbeing large diesel generator sets and thermal plants. For industries already owning captive\nplants the average operating cost is between Rs1.50 (for cogeneration) and Rs2.5 per kWh.\nFor new captive plants, the unit costs would vary between Rs2.0 to Rs3.5 (based on 1998 fuel\nprices).   Based on a 400 kW diesel generator, captive power cost was calculated at Rs3.6 per\nkWh.\nB. Economic Costs\n11. For the purposes of the economic analysis, the estimated capital costs for the five\nsubprojects were broken down into direct foreign exchange items, indirect foreign exchange,\nand local goods and services.  All costs elements were valued in border prices, using a world\nprice numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded and a standard conversion factor of 0.9 and\na labor conversion factor of 0.85 being applied to all nontraded items. Operating costs were\ncalculated as a fixed percentage of investment cost and were adjusted to reflect economic\nvalues.\n12. For  the  grid-strengthening  subprojects,  it  was  assumed  that  the  incremental  power\nsupply can be delivered within the existing power system network. No capital cost for generation\nand distribution was therefore included in the calculation. However, variable generation costs\nwere included and valued at Rs1.2 per kWh for a typical coal-fired plant located in the eastern\nregion close to the coal mine mouth.   A proportion of 25 percent of the costs of the state\nelectricity boards for operation and maintenance (O&M), administration, and miscellaneous\nexpenditures reflects incremental distribution costs.\n13. The economic benefits of transmission required to evacuate power from new generation\nprojects, such as Kawas II, are difficult to determine independently.  Transmission is an integral\npart of the total power system development plan and not an independent investment.  The\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  on  the  complete  investment  required  in  a  new\ngeneration project plus the associated transmission and distribution is normally considered as\nrepresentative of the rate of return on this investment, as transmission is typically a small part of\nthe total investment.\n14. Therefore,  the  economic  evaluations  of  the  generation-linked  subprojects  include\neconomic sent-out costs of power consisting of a capacity and an energy component.  These\nwere estimated based on data in the feasibility studies for the three generation plants. Capital\nand maintenance costs were annualized over an assumed 20-year economic life of the plants at\na social discount rate of 12 percent.  All costs were adjusted to reflect economic costs. Sent-", "71\nAppendix 14, page 3\nout costs are estimated at Rs1.23 per kWh for Anta- II, Rs1.22 per kWh for Gandhar II, and\nRs1.19 per kWh for Kawas- II.\n15. Anta- II is located some 600 kilometers (km) inland from the gas terminal and depends\non the HBJ-pipeline for transportation. For a conservative estimate, a capital investment of\n$50 million for compressors and other facilities to increase the pipeline capacity was included in\nthe economic evaluation.\n16. Given  the  magnitude  of  the  incremental  electricity  supply,  additional  investment  in\ndistribution facilities will be required. It was assumed that beneficiary states with an allocation of\nmore than 100 MW will need to expand/upgrade their distribution system. Those costs were\nestimated  based  on  the  commonly  used  formula  for  system  expansion,  which  assumes\ninvestment in generation:transmission:distribution, by a proportion of 60:15:25. It was assumed\nthat the distribution investment would be made in parallel to the transmission investment.  For\nstates with an allocation of less than 100 MW, only incremental distribution costs, estimated the\nsame way as for the grid-strengthening subprojects, were included.\nC. Conclusion\n17. On the basis of a comparison of economic costs and benefits over a 20-year project\nlifetime, the proposed subprojects all show EIRR well above the social discount rate of 12\npercent (Table A 14.3). Extensive sensitivity testing was carried out for the five subprojects. In\naddition to the traditional testing for increases in capital costs, decreases in benefits, and\nimplementation delays, further variables considered crucial parameters for economic viability\nwere identified. Testing for changes in the replacement and incremental shares of additional\nenergy for the different consumer groups showed very low sensitivity, with no impact on the\nviability of the subprojects. Further reduction of domestic consumer benefits to only 15 and 30\npercent of total domestic consumption shows that all projects will stay viable with the exception\nof Anta- II where the EIRR would drop to 10 percent if only 15 percent of total domestic\nconsumption is included in the benefit stream. Sensitivity testing for sent-out cost of power\nshowed that the viability of the Anta- II subproject depends critically on the availability of LNG as\na fuel source for the proposed new generation plant. If naphtha would need to be used during\nthe first year of operation, the project would not be viable.\n18. This is explained by two particularities of the subproject. The first reason is the higher\ncapital cost for the plant since the existing site is not as evolved as the sites for Gandhar- II and\nKawas- II. Second, Anta- II will serve states not served by Kawas- II and Gandhar-II plants, and\nthus has a different benefit stream.  The project sponsors recognized this sensitivity and, to\nmitigate the risks, have decided that production of the plant will only commence after LNG is\nmade available. Even with a two-year delay between the finalization of construction of the\ntransmission lines and the commencement of power generation, the subproject will be viable.\nIn the base case analysis for the grid-strengthening subprojects, power generation costs from\ncoal-fired plants were assumed to be Rs1.2 per kWh, or double the cost indicated by NTPC and\nPowergrid. An increase in the send-out costs to Rs2/kWh shows that both subprojects would\nbecome unviable. However, Powergrid and NTPC officially state that the sent-out costs from the\ncoal-fired plants are only Rs0.64/kWh as the coal plants are fully depreciated and testing for this\ncost shows that both projects are very robust.", "72\nAppendix 14, page 4\nTable A 14.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \nfor Kawas Transmission Line\n(Rs millions)\n   Transmission Generation Distribution Total
