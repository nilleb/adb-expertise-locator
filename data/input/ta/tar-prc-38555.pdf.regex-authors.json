The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA)1 from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to evaluate the effectiveness of \nenvironmental policies, plans, and investment programs for water pollution control, with a focus \non the Huai River basin and the Taihu Lake basin. The Government and ADB agreed that this \nTA will replace the earlier proposed TA for optimizing environmental programs sponsored by \ninternational  aid  agencies  and  will  be  included  in  the  2004  pipeline.2  After  receiving  ADB \nManagement\u2019s endorsement of the concept for this TA, a Fact-Finding Mission in August-\nSeptember 2004 held discussions with the State Environment Protection Administration (SEPA) \nand reached an understanding with the Government on the detailed objectives, scope, terms of \nreference of consultants, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Improved environmental management is essential in the PRC as the current level of \nenvironmental  damage imposes  an  extremely  high  cost  of  at  least  4\u20135%  of  annual  gross \ndomestic product.3 Water pollution control is a major concern.4 Water quality and quantity in \nthree important rivers (Hai, Huai, and Liao) and three major lakes (Chao, Dianchi, and Taihu) \nhave  dramatically  declined  since  the  1970s.  The  Government  placed  top  priority  on \nenvironmental improvement in these three rivers and three lakes during the 9th (1996\u20132000) \nand 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2001\u20132005) periods. Policies and plans were developed, and \ninvestments were made; however, 10 years later these water bodies have not become cleaner. \nOn the contrary, due to rapid economic growth, continuing urban expansion, and slow cleanup \nprogress, the gap between the environmental goals and the capacity to achieve them appears \nto have widened.  \n \n3.  The Huai River basin (HRB) covers 270,000 square kilometers (km2), has a population \nof 165 million, and is one of the largest and most polluted river basins in the PRC. The main \nstem originates in Henan Province with a total length of 1,000 km, and flows through Anhui, \nHenan, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces, including 35 cities and 189 counties. In 1995, the \nState Council set a target \u2013 \u201cHuai River becomes a clean river by year 2000\u201d and approved the \n9FYP  for  water  pollution  control,  requiring  that,  by  the  end  of  1997,  centralized  domestic \nwastewater treatment plants would have been built in 256 cities, all industrial enterprises along \nthe river would be meeting effluent standards, and 5,000 small-scale polluting enterprises would \nhave been shut down. However, more than 200 serious water pollution accidents have been \nrecorded, with \u201csuper pollution\u201d events in 1989, 1992, 1994, 2001, 2002, and 2004 that typically \ncovered pollution belts of 100\u2013150 km and caused drinking water supply difficulties for many \nhundreds of thousands of people, loss of aquatic life, as well as economic losses.  A World \nBank study of the Huai River in 2000 showed major pollution sources as urban and rural \n                                                 \n1\n The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 August 2004. \n2\n The originally proposed TA had limited scope and policy impacts. ADB, therefore, recommended that it be replaced \nwith a new TA proposal that reflects the Government\u2019s priorities and has strong policy implications.  \n3\n World Bank. 1997. Clean Water, Blue Skies. Washington, DC. estimated that air and water pollution cost China \nabout 8% of gross domestic product. \u201cGreen GDP\u201d estimates will be officially made by the State Environmental \nProtection Administration (SEPA), starting in 2004 on a pilot basis in selected areas. \n4\n Water pollution is caused by various contaminants including agricultural fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides, urban \ntoxic chemicals, oil, sediments, salts, bacteria, and nutrients from livestock and faulty septic systems as well as \natmospheric deposits. \u201cPoint\u201d pollution is direct discharges through discrete conveyance systems to water bodies, \ntypically municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater. \u201cNonpoint\u201d pollution is diffuse discharges that occur over \nlarge areas; sources include agriculture runoff, agrochemicals, urban runoff, mining dumps, forestry management, \nand airborne particulates. \u201cPoint\u201d pollution is often simpler to control than \u201cnonpoint\u201d pollution. ", "2 \nindustry  (67%),  livestock  (16%),  and  rural  and  municipal  sources  (16%).  Major  industrial \npollution sources were papermaking (57%), brewing and distillation (19%), and food (8%).5 \nMoreover, 2002 monitoring data on 93 river sections showed 44% of the sections did not meet \nthe Class V ambient water quality standards, and 39.8% of sections fell into Class V. 6 \n \n4.  The  Taihu  Lake  basin  (TLB)  covers  30  counties  and  cities  across  Anhui,  Jiangsu, \nShanghai, and Zhejiang provinces. The population is about 36.1 million with 18.4 million rural \npeople. The lake supports irrigation and water supply for surrounding cities. The Huangpujiang \nRiver, Shanghai\u2019s most important water source, also relies mainly on flows from the lake. Major \nproblems  are  (i)  underdeveloped  flood  management,  (ii)  water  pollution,  and  (iii)  water \nshortages  due  to  poor  raw  water  quality.  Although  sewerage  treatment  has  doubled  from \n600,000 tons treated to 1.3 million tons treated, thus approaching the 10FYP target, industrial \npollution loads into the Taihu Lake have increased, not decreased. \n \n5.  The  Government  has  implemented  major  time-bound  environmental  plans  and \ninvestment  programs  to  curb  water  pollution  in  both  basins,  including  urban  wastewater \ntreatment, industry readjustment, industry emission control, watershed management, sewerage \ncollection, water supply, urban waste treatment, ecosystem rehabilitation, dredging, nonpoint \nsource pollution control, and capacity building. In the 10FYP, 488 projects with total investment \nof CNY25.59 billion ($3 billion) were planned in HRB and 255 projects with total cost of CNY20 \nbillion ($2.4 billion) have been planned in TLB. By the end of 2003, 89 projects had been \ncompleted in HRB, and 53 in TLB. A series of laws and regulations have been adopted to \nconfront water pollution since the 1980s. The Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law was \nfirst promulgated in 1984. In 1994, the State Council issued the Regulation on HRB Water \nPollution Prevention and Control, the first location-specific law in the country. However, the legal \nand regulatory system has not worked adequately, and the victims of water pollution have not \nbeen given adequate attention.7  \n \n6.  In the two basins, the provinces concerned have primary responsibility for controlling \nwater  pollution  to  ensure  water  quality  within  provincial  boundaries.  However,  SEPA  as  a \nnational body and the environmental protection bureaus (EPBs) at provincial and lower levels \nfor water pollution control, are chartered to control only urban industrial waste pollution and do \nnot have jurisdiction over other sources of water pollution in municipalities (e.g., sewage) or \nagricultural  wastes  (non-point  pollution).  Since  the  beginning  of  the  9FYP,  the  PRC\u2019s \ninstitutional framework has been strengthened. A dialogue mechanism has been established \nwhereby the Premier and other Cabinet members meet annually with SEPA officials to discuss \nthe strategy for environmental protection and sustainability.8 However, collaboration across \nsectors is weak, mandates overlap, and division of responsibilities is unclear. SEPA/Ministry of \nWater Resources (MWR) formed a high-level committee but the work is delegated to local \ngovernments. Local governments have insufficient incentive, as to effectively regulate polluters \nis to directly reduce their income. The EPBs are similarly affected and there was no clear plan at \n                                                 \n5\n World Bank. 2001. Agenda for Water Sector Strategy for North China.

The complex institutional arrangements for water pollution \ncontrol are in Appendix 1. \n \n7.  The World Bank is the largest development partner agency in water pollution control in \nthe two areas and projects include (i) Huai River Pollution Control Project for Shandong and \nAnhui provinces, and (ii) Taihu Lake Pollution Control Project covering municipal sewerage \nsystems and capacity building for Wuxi City and Changzhou City of Jiangsu Province. ADB has \nhelped the Shanghai government to clean Suzhou Creek in TLB. The Netherlands Government \nhas supported several programs to strengthen the capacity of the local government for water \npollution control and management in Taihu Lake as well as in HRB since 1998. The United \nStates Environmental Protection Agency is supporting a project in HRB in Tianjin, covering a \ncomprehensive approach to control water pollution from municipal and industrial sources.  \n \n8.  Many newspaper articles have reported water quality problems, studies have been done \nto analyze specific cases, and there is mounting web-based public comment; however, there \nare no comprehensive evaluations to understand the efficacy, efficiency, and sustainability of \nthe  environmental  policies,  plans,  and  investment  programs  in  these  areas.  Under  the \nGovernment\u2019s new scientific approach, such work can guide future policies and priorities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The  TA  will  make  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  policy \nframework and investment program during the 9FYP and 10FYP in HRB and TLB. The TA will \nhave  three  major  outputs:  (i)  a  comprehensive  evaluation  report  identifying  performance \ncompared with targets, and the necessary priority reforms and the phasing required for long-\nterm control of water pollution; (ii) practical recommendations on legal, policy and institutional \nreforms, as well as financing and investment directions for river basin-based water pollution \ncontrol; and (iii) an integrated and basin-based evaluation methodology suitable for use in other \nrivers and lakes, with related training materials and guidelines (Appendix 2). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The methodology will be based on the Government\u2019s policies in general and the specific \nenvironmental plans for the two locations. The TA will take into account lessons from previous \nADB-funded TAs and other studies and will assess international and domestic best practices \nand available methodologies.9 Seminars and training workshops for awareness and capacity \nbuilding  will  be  conducted  at  basin  and  local  levels.  The  TA  will  undertake  the  following \nactivities: \n \n(i)  Review of HRB water pollution control and programs for 9FYP and 10FYP and the 9FYP \nand 10FYP Taihu Lake water pollution control and programs. The review will study plan \naccuracy  and  coverage  to  address  the  pollution  load,  financial  requirements  for \nimplementation, staffing and institutional capacity, and EPB capacity to enforce the \nplans. \n                                                 \n9\n Lessons will be drawn from the ongoing ADB. 2002.

This  will  require  coordination  with  the  local \ngovernments (through EPBs), MOA, and the Ministry of Land and Resources.   \n(vii)  Review SEPA\u2019s performance in core responsibilities and in coordinating other agencies. \n(viii)  Make a legal review of (a) the effectiveness of the legal and regulatory framework to \ncontrol water pollution, and (b) resolution of water pollution disputes for victims to claim \npollution remedies and compensation based on a survey of legal cases in HRB and TLB.  \n(ix)  Identify international best practices for river basin planning to control water pollution, \nmeasures for providing market-based incentives, economic measures and financing. \n(x)  Develop a training handbook, and web site materials on principles and methods for \nevaluating water pollution control policies and practices in river and lake basins. \n(xi)  Conduct two seminars at basin level (HRB and TLB) for planners and policy makers \nrelating to a comprehensive and participatory river and lake water pollution control; two \ntraining  workshops  at  county  and  city  levels  on  participatory  and  comprehensive \napproaches to water pollution control.   \n(xii)  Develop a methodology for evaluating a policy for river- and lake basin-level water \npollution.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising $206,000 in \nforeign exchange and $544,000 equivalent in local currency. It is proposed that ADB finance \n$500,000 equivalent, consisting of the entire foreign exchange cost and $294,000 equivalent in \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will provide the balance of local costs, equivalent to $250,000 to cover in-kind \ncounterpart costs and services.  Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  SEPA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. SEPA will prepare all relevant emissions \nand  monitoring  data  and  provide  all  relevant data  from  other  participating  agencies.   The \nexisting interagency coordination mechanism (footnote 8) will be used to ensure coordination. \nRelevant  representatives  from  key  agencies  involved  will  be  invited  to  attend  the  project \nworkshops and seminars. An expert panel comprising 6\u20138 senior academics and officials will \nprovide guidance to the TA consultants; panel members will be paid a lump sum honorarium. A \nTA management office (PMO) will be set up in SEPA to implement the TA. The PMO will be \nresponsible for interdepartmental coordination within SEPA, especially the departments of policy \nand law, planning and budgeting, and pollution control. SEPA will assign an official to serve as a \nTA task manager. Counterpart staff will be responsible for day-to-day communications and will \nwork closely with the TA consultants. SEPA will also provide office space and logistical support \nfor TA implementation using counterpart funds. ", "5 \n13.  The TA will be carried out over 12 months, starting in March 2005 and to be completed \nin March 2006. The TA will require 64 person-months of consulting services (8 international and \n56 domestic). The international consultants will comprise (i) a water pollution control specialist-\nteam leader, (ii) an emissions monitoring and evaluation specialist, and (iii) a permits systems \nspecialist. The three should have extensive experience in the PRC and with best practices in \nwater pollution control and planning in rivers and lakes. The domestic consultants will comprise \nan environmental specialist-deputy team leader, regulatory and policy specialist, legal specialist, \ninstitutional and planning specialist, environmental economist and investment specialist, water \nresources expert-hydrologist-water quality monitoring specialist, municipal sewerage specialist, \nand non-point pollution and rural specialist. Three survey teams will be engaged for (i) industrial \npollution, (ii) municipal waste, and (iii) rural nonpoint source pollution that will require 6 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services each (total of 18). The outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 4. \n \n14.    Under an ADB pilot study,10 SEPA will select and engage an international consulting \nfirm  in  association  with  domestic  consultants  on  the  basis  of  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The \nsimplified technical proposal procedure will be followed in engaging the consultants. \n \n15.  At the end of the first month, the consultants will submit to the Government and ADB an \ninception report and a seminar and workshop plan, which will be discussed in a tripartite review \nmeeting (TRM).  An interim report will be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of \nthe fifth month from the start of the TA, and the findings will be discussed in a seminar or \nworkshop participated in by stakeholders, and subsequently in a second TRM. A draft final \nreport will be submitted to the Government and ADB, 1 month before the end of the assignment, \nand will be presented by the consultant in the second national seminar. A third TRM, held \nbefore the conclusion of the TA, will discuss the draft final report. The recommendations from \nthe second national seminar and the third TRM will be incorporated into the final report in \nEnglish and Chinese (10 copies each), to be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end \nof the 12 months. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Evaluation of Environmental Policy \nand Investment for Water Pollution Control in the Huai River Basin and Taihu Lake Basin, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n10\n ADB. 2003.

The Government acknowledges that the terms and \nconditions of the TA framework agreement between the Government and ADB, dated 23 December 1996, apply to \nthis TA. Pursuant to Section 3.01 of the agreement, ADB will delegate consultant selection and supervision for \nfirms under this TA to the Government. The TA Letter Agreement, to be issued under the TA framework agreement \nfor this TA, will reflect this arrangement. Consultants engaged and supervised by the Government under this TA \nwill have the status of experts performing missions for ADB as accorded by the provisions of the Agreement \nEstablishing the Asian Development Bank and as further detailed in the TA framework agreement. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nINSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF WATER POLLUTION CONTROL \n \n1.  Environmental management is complex and decentralized, with the provincial and local \ngovernment environmental protection bureaus (EPBs) being responsible for implementing and \nenforcing environmental standards, rules, and regulations. The following are the institutional \narrangements for water pollution:  \n \n(i)  The  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (SEPA)  has  most  of  the \nresponsibility for environmental management, covering brown and green issues, \npolicy making and monitoring, nationwide standards and rules, and coordination \nof environment affairs across ministries. However, SEPA as a national body and \nthe EPBs at provincial and lower levels for water pollution control, are only \nmandated to control urban industrial waste pollution. SEPA and EPBs do not \nhave jurisdiction over other sources of water pollution coming from municipalities \nor agricultural wastes. \n(ii)  The local government is responsible for municipal wastewater.  \n(iii)  The Ministry of Construction (MOC) has strong influence and responsibility in \nurban  infrastructure  development,  including  wastewater  treatment  and  solid \nwaste management. \n(iv)  The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is responsible for non-point source pollution, \nincluding livestock and pesticide and fertilizer management. Since it is difficult to \nkeep track of the rural industries (e.g., there are about 4.5 million enterprises \nwithin the Huai River basin), SEPA and EPB do not have accurate information. \nHence if SEPA and the provincial EPBs monitor the main urban industries and \ncompute the waste loads from urban areas, they keep track of only about 42% of \nwastewater. There is a large rural industry sector, rural municipal and livestock \nsector  wastes  that  need  to  be  estimated  and  entered  into  the  waste  load \nequation. For the Huai River, the World Bank team in 2001 computed figures \nalmost 3\u20134 times higher than those reported by SEPA or the Ministry of Water \nResources (MWR). \n(v)  The  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  (MLR)  is  responsible  for  planning, \nadministering, and utilizing natural resources such as land, and groundwater \npollution. \n(vi)  MWR  has  responsibilities  for  water  allocation,  soil  and  water  conservation, \nwatershed management, and withdrawal licensing. \n(vii)  The State Forestry Administration (SFA) has significant responsibility related to \nforest and wetlands management, and biodiversity conservation. \n(viii)  The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has the mandate to \ncontrol  and  regulate  economic  development  planning,  review  and  guides \ninvestment proposals, including pollution control projects. \n \n2.  In the two basins, the provinces concerned have primary responsibility for water pollution \ncontrol  to  ensure  that  water  quality  within  the  provincial  boundaries  meets  the  targeted \nstandards.  SEPA  is  responsible  for  overall  planning  and  monitoring  of  water  pollution, \nsupervision of programs implementation, and overall coordination of ministries and provinces. \nSince the beginning of the 9th Five-Year Plan, the institutional framework of the People's \nRepublic of China has been strengthened, and is now far more capable of responding than was \nthe case only a decade ago. A dialogue mechanism has been established whereby the Premier \nand other Cabinet members meet annually with SEPA officials to discuss the strategy for ", "Appendix 1  7 \nenvironmental  protection  and  sustainability.1  However,  serious  weaknesses  exist.  A  main \nlimitation is weak collaboration across sectors, which is essential to make progress toward \nenvironmental goals. Mandates run across several agencies, often with unclear division of \nresponsibilities. SEPA still has little influence on sectoral plans and policies. It has crosscutting \nmandates and needs to collaborate well to succeed in this role. However, turf battles and \ncompetition for funding make horizontal cooperation among agencies very difficult. Also, SEPA \nhas a limited budget and staff resources, and has little direct influence over provincial budgets.  \n \n3.  While river basin authorities were organized to address transjurisdictional issues related \nto the utilization of major river systems, the functional structure of those authorities primarily \nfocuses on the construction of dams for hydroelectric power, flood control, bridges, and levees. \nThe authority to address the causes and effects of water pollution is concentrated in the EPBs, \nresulting sometimes in conflicts among provinces, although the central Government may order \nthe provincial EPBs to take necessary actions. In the absence of a dialogue mechanism among \nthe concerned EPBs, the cause of the potential conflict is rarely removed or remedies instituted \nbefore conflict occurs.  \n \n4.  SEPA-MWR formed a high level committee, but the work to bring compliance was \ndelegated to local governments at all levels. However, local governments have insufficient \nincentive to do that, as effectively regulating polluters will directly reduce the income of the local \ngovernments. The EPBs are similarly affected in this way. There was no clear plan at the local \nlevel\u2014emergency  program,  medium-term  program,  and  long-term  program\u2014to  make  each \nindustry comply. Water pollution control is SEPA\u2019s main function and SEPA needs to consider \ntaking control of all provincial, city, and county EPBs to ensure that a rational compliance \nprogram is developed in industries and municipalities, and in agriculture. Clearly, funding has to \nbe provided and all waste\u2014industrial, municipal, and agricultural\u2014needs to be part of the \nprogram. \n                                                 \n1\n A Joint Seats Committee involving all key agencies meets at ministerial level and director-general level on a case-\nby-case basis.
