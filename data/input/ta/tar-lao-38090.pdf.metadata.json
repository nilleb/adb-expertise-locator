In recognition of the role of industrial standards in facilitating trade, the Government of \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to support a Technical Assistance (TA) on Integrating the Poor in Regional Trade through \nIndustrial  Standard  Development.  The  TA  builds  on  a  Small-Scale  Technical  Assistance \n(SSTA),1 which  developed  the  strategy  and  road  map  to  upgrade  the  national  standards \nregulatory framework and supported pilot testing of standards among producer groups from \npoverty-stricken  districts.    In  order  to  implement  the  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory \nmeasures to support the framework, as well as to expand pilot activity across several sectors, \nthe Government requested ADB for TA  funds from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund \n(PRF) to upgrade the national standards regulatory framework so that it becomes aligned with \ninternational benchmark procedures. The TA will support the Government, the private sector, \nincluding  industry  associations,  academia  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  to \ndevelop the supporting institutional structure as well as to integrate the poor in the process of \nstandards development. Funding was endorsed in July 2003 and an advisory TA2 was included \nin the 2004 country strategy and program update (CSPU). The TA will complement capacity \nbuilding and programs to support reform in the private sector3 (see the TA framework in \nAppendix 1). The Fact-Finding Mission, fielded in October 2003, reached an understanding with \nthe Government on the purpose, approach, and implementation arrangements of the TA.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government has recognized the importance of trade in supporting growth and \nemployment.  At  present  three  product  categories\u2014namely  wood  products,  garments,  and \nagroindustrial food products (mainly coffee)\u2014account for 96% of total exports of merchandise \ngoods.  The  garments  industry,  dominated  by  foreign  enterprises,  has  the  highest  labor \nconcentration and employs close to 50% of people engaged in manufacturing.5 However, with \nthe phaseout of the Multifiber Arrangement by end-2004, the Government has focused on the \nneed to diversify export products to generate trade-related employment in other kinds of labor-\nintensive light manufacturing industries such as textiles, handicrafts, semiprocessed meat as \nwell as wood processing, produced in both urban and rural areas. At present, over 56% of light \nmanufacturing output is produced by small businesses6 in the major urban areas of Vientiane \nmunicipality,  Champasak,  Savannakhet,  and  Luang  Phrabang.  These  businesses  engage \n40,000 people (in both the manufacturing and retail sectors). Statistics on the handicraft sector, \ngathered from surveys7,  indicate that approximately 20,000 people are employed on a full-time \nbasis. An additional 100,000 are engaged, part-time, in rural areas.  \n                                                 \n1  The SSTA, funded by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, was initiated in June 2003 and completed in May \n2004. It developed the road map for the upgrading of the national standards regulatory framework and supported \nthe training of 700 poor households on quality control in the silk sector.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 March 2004. \n3  The implementation of the standards regulatory reform framework will take place in three stages: the SSTA (June \n2003\u2013May 2004), the ADTA (September 2004\u2014September 2005), and the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise \nand Private Sector Development  Program Loan (January 2006\u2013 January 2009), to finalize training and policy \nframework implementation. \n4  The Mission comprised M. Varkay (private sector development specialist), Governance, Finance, and Trade \nDivision, Mekong Department and an industrial standards and poverty reduction specialist (consultant). \n5   In terms of total industrial output, manufacturing contributes 56%, electricity 42%, and mining 2%. In terms of \nemployment, manufacturing employs 32,000 people, electricity over 3,500, and mining, 700.  \n6  UNIDO. 2001. Survey of Small Establishments. p.14. Small businesses employ on average 1\u20135 people.  \n7  UNIDO. March 2003. Report on Lao PDR: Medium-Term Strategy and Action Plan for Industrial Development \n(working manuscript), p. 44. The total value of output in the handicraft sector is estimated at $30 million\u201340 million. ", " 2\n3.  In terms of international market access, products that do not conform to international \nbenchmarking  procedures  recognized  by  the  World  Trade  Organization8 (WTO)  and  the \nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) are either excluded from the export market \nor significantly penalized in terms of pricing. With respect to the export readiness of Lao PDR \nproducts, surveys and workshops indicate that, with the exception of foreign owned or managed \nenterprises  producing  for  an  international  supply  chain,  the  variability  of  product  quality \noriginating from Lao PDR enterprises has constrained domestic and international buyers from \nsourcing products on a regular volume basis\u2014from both rural and urban areas.  \n \n4.  The absence of consistent quality control, resulting from disparate regulations across \nministries, has become an issue of concern to rural and urban small and medium enterprises \n(SMEs) producing for export. In workshops held under the SSTA, SMEs indicated (i) growing \ndissatisfaction over the lack of consistent procedures for standard development, particularly for \nagricultural  inputs  used  in  the  light  manufacturing  sector;  and  (ii) the  adverse  impact  on \nindustry's ability to access consistent quality of input and ensure volume procurement through \ncontracts9 with producer areas. In a country with a strong reliance on the agriculture sector to \nprovide for the welfare of a large proportion of the population\u2014agriculture's share of domestic \noutput is slightly above 50%, and 80% of the population are engaged in the agriculture sector\u2014\nthe urgency to develop quality control processes that are recognized by industry, government, \nand producers has become significant to employment and poverty reduction. This is especially \nrelevant for producers located in remote regions where improved quality control would enable \nnational SMEs to initiate procurement contracts, facilitate grade/price differentiation at farm gate, \nand thus lead to improved producer household incomes.10  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) emphasizes private sector development \n(PSD) and  SME11 development  as  a  major  factor  in  reducing  poverty. The Government\u2019s \nNational Poverty Eradication Program  also states that economic growth should be hastened \nthrough strong PSD/SME development, combined with poverty-reducing interventions in human \nresource  skills  development,  and  trade-based  employment  generated  through  improved \ncommercial linkages between rural and urban areas and production for export.  \n \n6.  The challenge for the Lao PDR is to streamline the national standards framework in \naccordance with WTO- and ISO-approved procedures, and to upgrade institutional capacity and \ntechnical skills in order to facilitate trade. The present regulatory framework, however, excludes \nthe major institutions involved in trade. Standards regulations are developed by the apex \ninstitution in the Prime Minister's Office, i.e., the Science, Technology and Environment Agency \n(STEA), with only sporadic consultation of government or industry on technical specifications of \nstandards. \n \n                                                 \n8  The Uruguay Round Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade clearly specifies the onus on governments, \nparticularly  Least  Developed  Countries  (LDCs),  to  upgrade/harmonize  their  national  standards  regulatory \nframework to conform to multilateral norms and procedures. A product standard provides attributes in respect of \nquality, usability, and related safety or environment aspects against certain established benchmarks, where \napplicable. Standards are supported by testing/evaluation facilities, metrology, and conformity assessment.  \n9  The SSTA undertook a detailed analysis of the technology, labor, and investment along the silk supply chain and \nreviewed the impact on production costs and investment.  \n10  From the point of view of households, the fundamental causes of poverty are natural and man-made disasters that \naffect livestock and rice yields, and lack of technical and commercial knowledge.  \n11  The Government's SME Decree will be implemented under TA 4279-LAO: Advisory Assistance on Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprise and Private Sector Development. \n ", "  3\n7.  The Government has recognized the constraints of the present system and adopted a \npolicy road map, during the SSTA,12 on upgrading the standards regulatory framework in \nsupport  of  economic  policy  objectives  both  on  trade  facilitation  and  on  consumer  and \nenvironment  protection.  The  Government  has  proposed  the  development  of  a  national \nstandards regulatory framework whereby standards are developed by the relevant government \nagency in close cooperation with the line ministries, trade associations, research institutes, \nconsumer associations, and international bodies, such as the ISO, and supported by law. Other \ndevelopment  partners  active  in  this  area  are  the  United  Nations  Industrial  Development \nOrganization (UNIDO), on capacity building of standards development in the chemistry and \nbiochemistry sectors; and the European Union, providing capacity building on policy related to \nWTO  accession.  However,  no  comprehensive  assistance  package  combines  the  sector \ndevelopment strategy13 (including policy and legal reform), financial assistance/loan, and TA.  \n \n8.  The  strategy  initiated  by  the  Government  for  an  industry-led  national  standards \nregulatory framework, with specific targets on poverty reduction, needs to address the following: \n(i) the limited access to skills development and training in quality control, occupational health, \nand  environment  safety  at  the  producer  level  in  poverty-stricken  areas.  (To  facilitate  the \nintegration of poor producers in the formal economy, training in technical skills that support the \napproved standards will likely be best achieved through the industry association and existing \nNGO network.); (ii) the absence of a law guiding the institutional structure of a standards council,  \nand the guiding regulations whereby the National Committee for Management of Standards and \nQuality assumes the apex role and becomes the Standard Council; (iii) the absence of ministry-\nlevel steering committees14 and technical committees on standards with representatives from \nthe Government, private sector (including NGOs), and academia; (iv) the lack of differentiation \nbetween government-led mandatory standards (health, safety, environment) and industry-led \nvoluntary standards; (v) the absence of a quality control knowledge center in the university; and \n(vi) sporadic coordination with other development partners on the development of the conformity \nassessment infrastructure (metrology, accreditation, and certification). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to (i) support the Government in developing an internationally \nrecognized standards regulatory framework and in training stakeholders along the process, i.e., \nproducers, purchasers, and regulators, in its application, in the textiles and handicraft subsector, \nagroindustry  subsector,  manufacturing  subsector  (selected  industrial  chemicals),  and \npharmaceutical subsector (priority drugs); and (ii) train producer groups from poverty-stricken \npilot districts in quality control, occupational health, and environment safety in the areas of silk \nprocessing, handicrafts, and nontimber forest products, through the Lao Handicraft Association \n                                                 \n12  The Poverty Reduction Fund-funded TA 4108-LAO  (ADB.  Year. Technical Assistance ot the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic for Integrating the Poor in Regional Trade through Private Sector Standard-Setting. Manila), \nundertook policy workshops with the Government, private sector, and NGOs to develop the strategy for upgrading \nthe national standards regulatory and institutional framework. The TA also developed the specifications of the silk \nstandard. The policy and institutional training workshops took place in July and August 2003 and February 2004, \nand the participatory workshops in selected poverty areas for the silk sector took place in June, July, August, and \nOctober 2003. Over 700 households were trained in quality control. \n13  The legal and regulatory issues relating to the national standards framework are addressed under TA 4279-LAO: \nAdvisory  Assistance  on  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  and  Private  Sector  Development  and  the \nprogrammed Private Sector Development Program Loan  in 2006\u20132009. \n14  The Steering Committee on Handicrafts and Textiles and the Technical Committee on Silk has been formed under \nTA 4108-LAO.  ", " 4\n(LHA) and NGO network. The regulatory framework will be consistent with and supplementary \nto  government  development  strategies.  Further  to  consultations  undertaken  with  the \nGovernment and stakeholders under the SSTA, the TA will expand the pilots developed under \nthe SSTA in Xieng Khouang and Louang Namtha, to Houaphanh and Borikhamxai,15 in order to \nfacilitate knowledge transfer on quality control between producers from poverty-stricken areas \nand SMEs in the LHA.16 There are over 118,000 households in the pilot provinces.17 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Component A will implement the revised institutional structure for standards setting. The \nTA will provide capacity building to develop the institutional and regulatory framework. The TA \nwill support the development of a standards council in the STEA, and the development of the \nconsultative  steering  committee  and  the  technical  committee  in  the  line  ministries,  with \ninvolvement of the private sector, academia, and NGOs to ensure wide acceptance of the \nstandards. The SSTA has implemented the committee structure in the Ministry of Industry and \nHandicraft (MIH) for handicraft and textiles. (See Appendix 4, subheading 5, on stakeholder-\napproved revised institutional structure for standard setting). Based on strong support from the \nGovernment and the private sector, the TA will (i) replicate and implement the committee \nstructure in  the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), Ministry of Health (MOH), and \nMinistry of Commerce (MOC); (ii) maintain capacity building initiated under the SSTA in  MIH; \nand (iii) involve academia in the National University and the private sector through the Lao \nNational  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  and  its  members,  including  the  LHA.  It  is \nexpected the TA will train up to 80 officials in the Government, at the national and provincial \nlevels, and twice that number in the private sector, academia, and NGOs.  \n \n11.  Component  B  will  organize  pilot  area  producers  from  poverty-stricken  districts  into \nproducer groups linked to the LHA. The TA will continue training in the silk standard undertaken \nunder  the  SSTA,  and  will  also  initiate  training  in  manufacturing  product/process  quality \nmanagement in nontimber forest products, which will facilitate the integration of poverty-stricken \ndistrict producers into national supply chains, and thus improve household income. Training will \nfocus on (i) quality control procedures in silk cocoon raising, silk reeling, and dyeing; (ii) quality \ncontrol in nontimber forest products (regional rice products, seasonal herbs, and vegetables); \n(iii) application of improved natural dyeing methods, further to research and development on \nnatural  dyes  and  testing  of  synthetic  chemicals;18 (iv) market  monitoring  techniques  and \nutilization  of  market  information  to  upgrade  quality  control  processes  and  standards;  and \n(v) integration of pilot area producers into the LHA to facilitate training in quality control. Based \non the pace of training program outreach under the SSTA, it is expected that the TA will \ncomplete the training of over 3,000 producers in quality control methods in the silk sector and \nnontimber agroforestry products. \n \n12.  During TA inception, a policy review and capacity-building road map will be drawn up for \ncomponents A and B, to be agreed to with the Government, the private sector, academia and \n                                                 \n15  Poverty incidence in Houaphanh (75%), Oudomxai (73%), and Louang Namtha (58%) remains high, while it has \ndecreased in Xieng Khouang (from 57% in 1992 to 35% in 1998) but has risen in Borikhamxai (from 11% to 26%). \n16  The LNCCI represents 13 industry associations. The Lao Handicraft Association is the most proactive in terms of \nmembership outreach to SMEs as well as development of international information networks.  \n17  December 1999.

(Appendix 1, \nTable 4).  \n18  One consequence of increased silk production will be soil pollution arising from the discharge of waste dyeing \nchemicals. There is a need to consider the application of alternate dyeing techniques that will safeguard worker \nhealth and prevent environment pollution. \n ", "  5\nNGOs. Each stage of TA implementation, namely (i) development of a standards council and \nsupporting technical and steering committees in four line ministries; (ii) review and development \nof priority standards with the Government, private sector, and academia; (iii) development of \nproducer organizations linked to LHA; and (iv) training in quality control of producers and SMEs, \nwill be reviewed in consultation workshops with the Government, private sector, and NGOs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $825,000 consisting of $529,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $296,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The entire foreign exchange \ncost and $171,000 equivalent of the local currency cost will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPoverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund,  which  was  made  available  to  ADB  and  is  to  be \nadministered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency costs in kind by providing office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart \nstaff, local transportation, and workshop and communications support. The TA will be charged \nagainst the indicative planning figure for 2004.  The cost estimate and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  STEA will be the Executing Agency. ADB has requested that a high-level consultation \ngroup be established, headed by STEA. The implementing agencies include the MIH; MAF; \nMinistry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Post  and  Construction;  MOH;  and  other  relevant \ngovernment agencies, as well as the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Inputs \nfrom business associations, as well as NGOs, will be sought throughout TA implementation. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from January 2005 to end-December 2005, \nand will require a team of eight international (27.5 person-months total) and eight domestic (43 \nperson-months total) consultants. For the international consultants, the following experts will be \nrecruited: institutional standardization expert;  senior advisor to a standards council in STEA; \nexpert in sericulture, agroindustry, and nontimber forest standards; expert in manufacturing and \nconstruction  processes;  expert  in  pharmaceuticals  and  cosmetic  soaps;  expert  in  wood \nprocessing; expert in quality control management; and expert in audit and inspection. The \ndomestic consultants will include four sector specialists and 4 expert trainers. The consultant \nteam will produce an inception report, two interim reports, and a final report; each will be \ndiscussed during tripartite meetings.  The consultant team will either be a firm or individual \nconsultants.  The  contract  with the consultants  will  be  based  on  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection.  The  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof the Lao People's Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund for Integrating the Poor in Regional Trade Through Industrial \nStandard Development\u2014Phase II, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and \nRisks \nGoal       \n        \nThe goal is to foster trade  Lower rate of poverty incidence  Poverty incidence studies in \nfacilitation and improve the  and depth.  the Lao Expenditure and \nvolume and value of Lao    Consumption Survey. \nPeople\u2019s Democratic  Trend to increase volume and  (Source: Committee for \nRepublic\u2019s (Lao PDR) light  value of export by small and  Planning and Cooperation, \nmanufacturing exports.   medium-sized enterprises  National Statistical Centre). \n(SMEs) (including  External trade statistics. \nmanufacturing product) and  (Source: UNCOMTRADE, \npoor producers for products  UN external trade statistics). \nsuch as silk and nontimber   \nforest products. \nPurpose      Assumption: \n       \nInternationally recognized  Implementation of a standards  TA consultants review rate of  Standards Council \nstandards regulatory framework council in Science, Technology  development of standards  framework is \nadopted by the Government,  and Environment Agency.  and quality control  operationalized and \nprivate sector, and producers in Structuring of steering  procedures at technical  enforced. \npoverty-stricken districts.  committees and technical  committee level in   \n  committees in the line  coordination with private   \nministries\u2014agriculture, industry  sector.

Background \n \n1.  The World Trade Organization (WTO) has made a clear requirement for all member and \nacceding countries to upgrade their trade and commercial regulatory frameworks to ensure that \nproducts traded internationally conform to a harmonized regime of international standards1 and \ntechnical regulations. Consequently, developing country standards bodies now need to consider \nwhat evolving international rules2 are most critical to their national interest in order to facilitate \nand maintain access to export markets.  \n \n2.  Many developing countries and economies in transition have strengthened the role of \ntheir national standards body in order to improve market access for exports as well as facilitate \nindustry integration into global value chains. For example, Central American countries have \nencouraged their national standards bodies to integrate standards upgrading strategies with \neconomic policy objectives on productivity and trade. In Poland, the national standards body \nhas  worked  with  the  domestic  private  sector  and  relevant  line  ministries,  to  identify  and \nimplement  international  standards  that  have  facilitated  local  company  integration  in  the \nproduction and marketing arrangements of multinational corporations.  \n \n3.  The purpose of the national standards regulatory framework is to ensure a \"standard for \na standard\" and thus avoid unnecessary or inappropriate regulatory guidelines. A national \nstandards  regulatory  framework  consists  of  the  following:  (i) standards developed by the \nrelevant government agency in close cooperation with the line ministries, trade associations, \nresearch institutes, consumer associations, and international bodies such as the International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO); (ii) the conformity assessment infrastructure, which is \nthe testing, accreditation, and certification system; and (iii) audit and inspection. The national \nstandards regulatory framework is supported by laws and regulations in the area of legal \nmetrology  as  well  as  environment,  consumer  and  industrial  safety,  and  trademark  and \nintellectual property rights. Standards may be voluntary or mandatory (health, environment, \nsafety) and are supported by technical regulations or codes of practice.3 Voluntary standards \nare driven by the private sector and guided by government policies. All trading economies have \na national standards regulatory framework.4  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that up to 80% of world trade is \naffected  by  standards  and  by  their  rapid  evolution.  OECD.  1999.  Regulatory  Reform  and  International \nStandardization. TD/TC/WP (98) 36. January.  \n2  The most accessible mechanism for upgrading a developing country\u2019s standards regulatory framework has been \nto improve information exchange between the national standards body and the International Organization for \nStandardization  (ISO)  in  order  to  adopt  internationally  approved  standards  and  monitor  their  consistent \nimplementation by national government ministries and the private sector.  \n3  The OECD has defined a standard as \"a document, approved by a recognized body that provides for common and \nrepeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods.\"  \nOECD, Regulatory Reform and International Standardization, TD/TC/WP (98) 36, January 1999. A technical \nregulation may rise to the level of a standard if its characteristics are recognized by expert consensus and its use \nis consistent. \n4  Post-World War II OECD economies recognized the importance of harmonized standards to the development of \ntheir  private  sector\u2014specifically  to  facilitate  consistency  of  imported  inputs  for  improved  productivity  in \nmanufacturing plants. The ISO was established in 1947 as a federation of national standards bodies, to promote \nstandardization. \n ", "    Appendix 4  17\nB.  Revised Institutional Structure for Lao PDR National Standardization \n \n4.  During the small-scale technical assistance (SSTA), public-private sector standards \nworkshops revised and developed the organization chart for the standardization process. Post-\nworkshop discussions with Science, Technology and Environment Agency (STEA) and Ministry \nof Industry and Handicraft (MIH), as well as with the private sector, confirmed stakeholder \ncommitment to establish the steering and technical committee structure. The terms of reference \nfor the steering committee on handicraft and textile were developed and agreed, and the \ncommittee structure was implemented, by end-August 2004. \n \n5.  The model is based on that practiced in Singapore for more than 30 years. Members in \nthe workshop considered the existing National Committee for Management of Standards and \nQuality (NCMSQ) as the apex, equivalent to the proposed Standards  Council,  in  the  new \norganization structure. Based on feedback from the workshop, the various steering committees \nwill report to the NCMSQ. The workshop also recommended to upgrade Prime Minister\u2019s \nDecree No. 85 to a law incorporating the new features of the standardization infrastructure. This \nwill demonstrate the commitment of the Lao PDR to aligning its standardization infrastructure to \ninternational practice.  \n \n  1.  Institutional Framework \n \n  a.  Standards Council \n  \n6.  The Standards Council formulates the strategies and direction for the Lao PDR national \nstandardization program. It is positioned at the apex of the standardization process and its role \nentails the highest level of strategic decision-making. To this end, it is recommended that its \nmembers should be nominated from senior decision makers of enterprises at Chief Executive \nOfficer (CEO) level and from at least director generals from the public sector. Membership \nshould also include the president of Lao National chamber of Commerce and Industry (LNCCI), \ndean of engineering or science of National University of Laos, and chairpersons of all standards \nsteering  committees,  the  last  category  of  membership  being  provided  for  in  the  steering \ncommittee  terms  of  reference.  Given  the  revised  membership  to  reflect  the  high  level  of \nrepresentatives, it is appropriate to invite the president of STEA to be the chairperson of the \nStandards Council (see proposed structure in  Figure A4: Revised Standards Organization \nStructure for the Lao PDR).  It is envisaged that standardization will be much more efficient in \nterms of approving standards in a shorter period.  \n \n    b.  Steering Committees \n \n7.  At the steering committee level, members will have a broad business and strategic view \non the industry sector in which product/process standardization takes place. Members have to \nensure the draft standards submitted by technical committees are not biased toward certain \ncommercial  products  or  processes.  The  governance  process  is  carried  out  by  public \nconsultation of draft standards prior to publication. It is recommended that the chairperson of the \nsteering committee be a senior management member from the industry sector or a director \ngeneral of the relevant ministry. The terms of reference for the steering committee of handicraft \nand textile sector are also applicable to steering committees of other industry sectors.  \n ", "18   Appendix 4 \n    c.  Technical Committees \n \n8.  In accordance with the hierarchy of the revised standardization organization and the \nterms of reference of steering committees, the SSTA agreed the technical committees are the \ncore operating units in deliberating the contents and drafting the text of standards. Members are \nmainly experts who have domain knowledge in the specific field considered for standardization. \nDomain knowledge in this case refers to product/process technology, user requirements, and \nbenchmarking  in  deciding  the  product/process  attributes  to  be  included  in  a  standard.  A \ntechnical committee may form an ad hoc work group to address certain aspects of the standard \nunder drafting. \n \n9.  The SSTA determined in stakeholder workshops that standardization for products and \nprocesses is meaningful to the extent that quality, acceptable to customers and achievable in \nproduction, is specified in standards. Standardization at the industry or enterprise level should \naddress processes that lead to establishing the pertinent standards. Standardization is a tool, \nnot the end product, in enhancing the competitiveness of industry. Capacity building for the \nparticular industry sector in terms of technology upgrading, supply chain management, quality \nmanagement, and human resources/skills development is essential in achieving quality product \nand process standards commensurate with international benchmarks.  \n \n2.  Roles of Science, Technology and Environment Agency \n \na.  National Standards Body of the Lao PDR \n \n10.  The SSTA confirmed that STEA would continue to play its role as the national standards \nauthority.  It  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  publishing  Lao  PDR  standards  and  for \nrepresenting the Lao PDR in regional and international standards activities. It will also promote \nthe alignment of national standards to international standards, wherever applicable, and ensure \ntransparency in the standardization process and conformity assessment to facilitate Lao PDR \nexports and product competitiveness. STEA will also continue to play its role as the secretariat \nfor all levels of standardization committees.  \n \nb.  Certification/Inspection vs Accreditation Service \n \n11.  Currently  the  Standards  and  Quality  Division  of  STEA  conducts  certification  and \ninspection for certain categories of products. However, STEA is expected to introduce an \naccreditation  service  in  line  with  international  practice.  Having  certification/inspection  and \naccreditation within the same ministry will give rise to conflicts of interest. It is recommended \nthat STEA consider transferring the operation to MIH in due course when it will take charge of \naccreditation for certification/inspection bodies.  \n \n3.  Role of Line Ministries \n \n12.  Complementing the administrative tasks of STEA, the SSTA stakeholder workshops \ndetermined that line ministries (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry [MAF], MIH, Ministry of \nCommerce [MOC], Ministry of Health [MOH], etc.) are in a position to discharge their respective \nresponsibilities in inputting technical contents of products and services standardization through \nworking with private sector. Also under the current arrangement, line ministries are responsible \nfor approving members in steering committee for products and services under the purview of the \nministry.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 4  19\n13.  At  present,  the  Centre  for  Industry  Research  and  Development  [CIRD]  of  MIH  is \naccepting  second-party  inspection  reports  based  on  witness  testing  at  laboratory  of  the \nmanufacturer. In the absence of calibration capability in the Lao PDR, such practices should \nonly be considered temporary, pending the setting up of metrology facilities in a new building. \n \n4.  Roles of Lao PDR Industry Associations \n \n14.  The SSTA determined, together with the private sector and Government, the importance \nof assigning effective membership from both private and public sectors, at all levels of the \nstandardization organization. The credibility of voluntary standards hinges on the private sector \nplaying a pivotal role and taking ownership of the standardization process. Industry associations \nplay  a  key  role,  in  partnership  with  government  agencies,  in  driving  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s \nstandardization work. Such roles could include coordination of training in trade skills, quality \ncontrol,  and  basic  concepts  of  standardization  to  supervisors  and  middle  managers  of \nenterprises.
