Bank  Republic  has  identified  the  development  of  the \nSME sector in Georgia as a key objective in its business strategy, \nin addition to its being central to the recovery of the economy in \nthe aftermath of the armed conflict with the Russian Federation in \nAugust 2008 and the global economic downturn. The proposed \nloan will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed for commercial \nrisks by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Bank Republic\u2019s majority owner. \n   \nFinancial Intermediary  Bank  Republic  is  among  the  oldest  privately  owned  banks  in \nGeorgia, and was founded as a joint-stock company in 1991. It is \nthe third-largest bank in Georgia, with total assets of GEL756 \nmillion ($451 million) as of 30 June 2009. The bank has a network \nof 26 branches and 19 service centers which provide a range of \nretail, corporate, and financial services products. Bank Republic is \n60% owned by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (among the leading European \nfinancial services companies), which acquired its shares in 2006. \nIn  the  same  year,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment acquired a 10% shareholding in the bank.  \n   \nDevelopment Impact  ADB\u2019s  proposed  loan  will  support  the  growth  of  the  emerging \nbanking sector in Georgia and increase SME access to financing. \nThis will be achieved through relatively long-term funding (a 4-\nyear loan) for SME lending by Bank Republic, to enable it to \nexpand its loan portfolio. \n \n(i)  Impact. The transaction will (a) provide systemic support \nto the Georgian banking sector at a critical point in its \ndevelopment and help to renew confidence in the country's \nbanking  system,  (b)  allow  Bank  Republic  to  increase \nfinancial intermediation in line with its strategic plans, and \n(c) contribute to private sector development in Georgia by ", "ii   \nhelping  to  mobilize  liquidity  and  channel  it  towards  the \nmost  productive  investments  through  the  extension  of \ncredit. \n \n(ii)  Outcome. With the help of debt funding from ADB, Bank \nRepublic  will  renew  its  lending  activities,  which  will \ncontribute to increasing confidence in the banking sector, \nand provide increased, sustainable access to finance to \nSMEs in Georgia.  \n \n(iii)  Outputs.  Bank  Republic  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the \nsenior loan from ADB to expand its SME loan portfolio.  \n   \nProposed ADB  ADB will provide a dollar-denominated senior loan of up to $20 \nAssistance  million to Bank Republic for up to 4 years, with a grace period of 1 \nyear, an availability period of 1 year, and semiannual repayments. \nThe proposed loan will be sourced from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  and  will  carry  an  interest  rate  based  on  the  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  plus  a  margin  determined  by  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment committee. The committee will also determine the up-\nfront and commitment fees. The proposed loan will be unsecured \nbut  it  will  be  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  (subject  to \ncertain  political  risk  exclusions)  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,  Bank \nRepublic\u2019s majority shareholder. \n   \nRisks and Mitigating  Comprehensive due diligence conducted by ADB to gauge the \nMeasures  viability of the proposed investment determined the risks overall to \nbe  acceptable  for  a  transaction  of  this  kind.  The  main  risks \nidentified were (i) political instability, both regionally and internally; \n(ii) political violence; (iii) declining macroeconomic conditions; (iv) \nweak banking and financial sector; (v) deteriorating asset quality; \n(vi) low capitalization; and (vii) increasing competition. \n \nThe identified risks are mitigated by the following considerations: \n(i) the risk of payment default is unconditionally and irrevocably \nguaranteed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, subject to certain political risk \nexclusions; (ii) the range of political risk exposure retained by ADB \nunder  this  transaction  is  to  some  degree  mitigated  by  ADB's \nrelationship  with  the  Government  of  Georgia;  and  (iii)  Bank \nRepublic has strong shareholder support. \n   \nJustification / ADB Value  Justification for the loan is based on the following considerations: \nAdded   \n(i)  Systemic  support  for  Georgian  banking  sector.  The \nproposed  loan  will  provide  systemic  support  to  the \nGeorgian  banking  sector  at  a  critical  point  in  its \ndevelopment and help to renew confidence in the country\u2019s \nbanking  system.  Lending  activity  among  the  banks  in \nGeorgia  has  all  but  stopped  as  a  consequence  of  the \nconflict and global crisis. As banks are a key source of \nsmall and micro loans for the private sector, in particular ", "      iii\nfor individual entrepreneurs and SMEs, they are crucial to \nthe recovery of the Georgian economy. \n \n(ii)  Increase  access  to  SME  financing.  The  proposed \ntransaction  will  foster  Bank  Republic\u2019s  SME  financing \noperations by providing debt funding needed for renewal of \nlending to this particular sector. This will in turn help to \nexpand the SME sector itself, which is a main force behind \neconomic growth in Georgia and contributes significantly to \nemployment creation.   \n \n(iii)  Catalyze foreign funds into Georgia. In conjunction with \nmarket  support  from  other  international  financial \ninstitutions, ADB's proposed loan will provide a signal of \nconfidence in the underlying fundamentals of the Georgian \neconomy and the banking sector during the current period \nof  uncertainty  and  help  to  catalyze  a  return  of  foreign \ninvestment into the country.   \n \n(iv)  Support of foreign investment. ADB's proposed loan and \nits coverage of the political risks in the transaction will also \nprovide support to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's long-term objective \nof expanding its role in the development of the Georgian \nbanking sector and in expanding SME lending in particular. \nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  perceives  ADB's  relationship  with  the \nGovernment of Georgia as providing it some measure of \ncomfort  for  the  political  risks  associated  with  its \nparticipation, as a private sector entity, in the country's \neconomic development. \n   \nImplementation  The proposed terms of the loan documentation will require Bank \nArrangements  Republic to submit financial statements and information on the \nsub-borrowers on a routine basis. \n   \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ndollar-denominated senior loan of up to $20 million with a tenor of up to 4 years to Bank \nRepublic, Joint-Stock Company of Georgia for the purpose of onlending to small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) in Georgia. The commercial risks associated with the proposed loan \nwill be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the majority shareholder of \nBank  Republic. The  design  and monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1  and  the  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Economic and Sector Background \n \n1.  Economic Overview \n \n2.  The Georgian economy experienced unprecedented growth during 2003\u20132007 as a \nresult of macroeconomic stabilization, structural reform, and economic liberalization measures.1 \nDramatic improvements in the business environment and massive inflows of foreign direct \ninvestment  fueled  Georgia's  economic  growth,  particularly  in  nontradable  sectors  such  as \nfinancial services and construction. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of \n9.7% during this period, peaking in 2007 with growth of 12.4% (Table 1). Georgia\u2019s economic \nperformance during this time also benefited from stronger public finances as a result of tax \nreforms, anticorruption efforts, and the reduction of the shadow economy.  \n \n3.  The underpinnings of economic growth and stability in Georgia, however, were shaken \nas a result of the twin crises which occurred in 2008. In August 2008, tensions with the Russian \nFederation reached a climax when armed conflict broke out between the two countries over the \nregions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Although brief, the economic disruption caused by this \nconflict, when combined with the onset of the global financial downturn in the autumn of 2008, \nadversely  impacted  the  Georgian  economy.  Before  the  conflict  and  exogenous  economic \nshocks, GDP growth was forecast to be 8%\u20139% for both 2008 and 2009. In the aftermath, \n \noverall growth was dampened by the damage to infrastructure and the disruption in several \nsectors of the economy including construction and transportation. Increased security concerns \neroded confidence and resulted in temporary deposit withdrawals from banks, depreciation \npressures, and a slowdown in bank lending. The global economic downturn led to a further \nslowdown in foreign direct investment and a drying up of private international borrowing, which \ncontinued through the first half of 2009. The situation was further aggravated by the decline in \nremittances, a slowdown in Georgia's export markets, and the curtailing of lending by Georgian \nbanks. As a result, GDP growth dropped to 2.1% in 2008 and is forecast to contract by 4.0% in \n2009 before returning to growth, albeit sluggish at 2.0%, in 2010. Medium-term growth is \nexpected to rise gradually to 5.0%, although projections are predicated on the size of the \neconomic contraction in 2009, the timing and pace of economic recovery, and the resumption of \nprivate capital flows (Appendix 4 has more detailed economic analysis).  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Georgia was named the number 1 reformer among 181 economies by the World Bank in its 2007 Doing Business \nsurvey and according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) the country was the \nthird-lowest in corruption in 2007. Continued efforts have further boosted Georgia\u2019s ranking in the 2008 Doing \nBusiness survey, rising to 18th from 37th in 2006.

Banking Sector \n \n4.  General. With the consolidation of the Georgian banking sector over the past 15 years \n(247 banks in 1995 to 19 banks as of 31 August 2009), six commercial banks2 dominate the \nmarket, accounting for nearly 84% of total assets and 88% of gross loans (Figure 1). The \nbanking sector is fully privatized and all leading banks have foreign capital participation. Foreign \nbanks such as HSBC, Halyk, Privat, and JSC Kor Bank have also established a local presence \nin the market.

", "  3\n \n5.  Penetration of the Georgian banking system is still fairly low compared with most Central \nand Eastern European and Commonwealth of Independent States countries, although it has \nimproved over the last 4 years as the scales of operations and asset bases of the leading banks \nhave grown. The potential for market growth is emphasized by the comparatively low ratios of \ngross loans to GDP (29.1%) and deposits to GDP (14.7%), recorded as of year-end 2008. \n \n6.  Crisis period. The conflict with the Russian Federation in August 2008 caused a short \ndisruption in banking activity. However, the short duration of military hostilities and National \nBank of Georgia (NBG) action were sufficient to maintain the stability of the sector, despite a run \non deposits. Pressure was contained and confidence in the system was supported, largely as a \nresult of NBG measures, which included (i) initially pegging the lari to the dollar, (ii) setting limits \non deposit withdrawals (declaring a bank holiday), and (iii) activating an uncollateralized lari \nbank lending facility. Although the run on deposits lasted only 10 days, deposits continued to \ndecline, albeit at a slower pace, throughout the fourth quarter of 2008 and into the first quarter of \n2009, as the disruption of many business operations necessitated a number of both corporate \nentities and individuals to tap their savings. \n \n7.  Aside from NBG action, international financial aid was also instrumental in maintaining \nfinancial stability in Georgia, particularly following the European Union\u2013World Bank Conference \nin Brussels in October 2008 when more than $4.5 billion was pledged to aid infrastructure \nreconstruction and social assistance. The NBG's measures were subsequently suspended as \nthe situation normalized. After removing the peg to the dollar, the NBG allowed the lari to \ndevalue by around 10% in November 2008, and has since defended the new exchange rate. \nPressure on the exchange rate has eased off and has been fairly comfortably managed with the \nsupport of a $726 million International Monetary Fund (IMF) facility. \n \n8.  Sector  performance.  Key  performance  indicators  in  the  Georgian  banking  sector \nimproved significantly during 2005\u20132007, in line with overall economic growth in Georgia (Table \n2). Credit grew on average by 68.4% during this time, while nonbank deposits increased on \naverage by 49.3%. Net income also strengthened. Such improvement continued through the \nfirst half of 2008, but abated following the difficulties in the second half of the year. The rate of \ngrowth in 2008 was substantially lower for both aggregate loans (which rose by 30.6%) and \ndeposits (which rose by 11.0%), and the sector recorded an aggregate net loss. During the first \nhalf of 2009, the sector actually contracted as aggregated total assets declined (falling by 12.8% \nfrom year-end 2008) and lending activity slowed significantly (decreasing by 10.4%).

Notwithstanding the difficulties brought about by the twin crises, the Georgian banking \nsector  has  shown  a  degree  of  resilience,  helped  by  external  financial  support  which  has \nunderpinned bank capitalization and liquidity. However, asset quality across the sector has \ndeteriorated quite significantly and there is continued uncertainty about the deposit base. The \naggregate ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans has increased by 4.9 times from \n2.6% as of year-end 2007 to 12.8% in 2008, and further increased to 18.8% as of 30 June 2009. \nSo  far,  domestic  currency  loans  have  been  disproportionately  affected,  but  stress  testing \nindicates the vulnerability of the loan portfolio to further exchange rate depreciation. Despite a \nslight increase in deposits registered in the fourth quarter of 2008, following a sharp fall in the \nthird quarter, the volume of bank deposits fell again in the first quarter of 2009, according to the \nNBG, registering a year-on-year contraction of 6% and a quarter-on-quarter fall of 14%. Early \nindications, however, suggest that deposits may have stabilized during the second quarter of \n2009, despite the ongoing economic contraction. Banking sector deposits increased modestly \nduring this period by 6.8% quarter-on-quarter, yet continued strengthening is unclear.  \n \n10.  Faced with these circumstances, and with little prospect for additional recapitalization in \nthe short term, banks have continued to build up precautionary balances. Although the banks\u2019 \ncautious attitude to lending has had prudential benefits, giving way to increased liquidity and \nimproved loan\u2013deposit ratios, it has also placed additional strains on the economy. \n \n11.  Supervision. In March 2008, the government adopted the Global Competitiveness of \nthe Financial Services Sector Act that triggered broad changes in 26 other laws and aimed to \nenhance the stability and global competitiveness of the Georgian financial sector. Most notably, \nunder this act, the Financial Services Agency was established as an autonomous agency \ntasked  with  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  control  of  the  banking  sector.  Although  newly \ncreated, it is intended that the Financial Services Agency will be merged back into the NBG to ", "      5\nconsolidate supervision of the entire financial sector under one entity (draft legislation is being \nconsidered by the parliament). The strengthening of regulatory and supervisory control under \nthe NBG was undertaken as a means to address certain vulnerabilities in the banking sector \nbrought about by the twin crises to potential exchange rate shocks, declining real estates prices, \nand the possibility of a longer and deeper recession. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthrough its Central and West Asia Department, is providing key technical assistance to the \nFinancial Services Agency and NBG, as well as programmatic backup support to assist in the \nefforts of banking sector restructuring. \n \n3.  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector: Binding Constraints on Small \nand Medium-Sized Enterprise Development \n \n12.  In most developing countries, SMEs are the main source of employment and economic \ngrowth, acting as an important engine of growth and a key contributor to poverty reduction by \ncreating employment, increasing individual incomes, and generating tax revenues. The situation \nin  Georgia,  however,  is  notably  different.  Although  SMEs  are  the  most  common  type  of \nenterprise,3  large  privatized  enterprises  dominate  output  and  employment.  The \nunderdevelopment of the SME sector is apparent in statistics from Georgia\u2019s statistical bureau, \nwhich reveal that, as of the first half of 2009, small enterprises (broadly defined as having an \naverage of up to 20 employees and turnover which does not exceed GEL500,000 per annum) \nemployed only 13% of workers and medium-sized enterprises (defined as having an average of \nup to 100 employees and turnover which does not exceed GEL1,500,000 per annum) employed \nonly 14% of workers, while large enterprises (defined as having an average of more than 100 \nemployees and turnover which exceeds GEL1,500,000 per annum) employed over 72% (Table \n3).4 This disparity is echoed in the respective contributions of large versus small and medium-\nsized businesses to the economy; in the first half of 2009, large businesses contributed almost \n90% of output, while SMEs made up approximately 10% (Table 4).5 \n \nTable 3: Number of Employed Persons in Enterprises, by Size of Enterprise \n(%) \nYear  Large  Medium  Small \n2002  64.3  18.8  16.9 \n2003  66.8  16.7  16.5 \n2004  65.3  17.7  17.0 \n2005  61.4  19.4  19.2 \n2006  63.9  17.7  18.4 \n2007  68.1  17.8  14.1 \n2008  70.1  14.4  15.5 \nQ1 2009  73.1  14.1  12.8 \nQ2 2009  72.1  14.0  13.9 \nNote:  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are currently not defined \nunder Georgian law.

The SME sector in Georgia remains highly constrained6 despite recent improvement in \nthe  enabling  environment  as  a  result  of  efforts  undertaken  by  the  International  Finance \nCorporation (IFC) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In \n2006, the IFC implemented the Georgia Business Enabling Environment Project, which aimed \nto improve the business enabling environment in Georgia by reducing administrative barriers to \nrunning and operating small businesses. The project focused on streamlining the process and \nintroducing  elements  of  regulatory  impact  assessment.  In  the  same  year,  the  IFC  also \nimplemented  the  Georgia  Corporate  Governance  Project,  which  worked  to  improve  the \ncorporate governance practices of Georgian joint-stock companies and banks, thereby helping \nthem to operate more effectively and allowing them easier access to capital. These programs, \ncoupled with the EBRD's efforts to stimulate economic growth through support for microfinance \nand SME development through its Early Transition Countries Initiative and other Government of \nGeorgia initiatives, have substantially reduced the administrative burden for enterprises and \nlimited the amount of time spent dealing with government bureaucracy.7 Despite this, SME \ndevelopment has been hampered by financing difficulties.  \n \n14.  In most of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs), SMEs have difficulty gaining \naccess to financial services and securing financing. Although bank loans are the dominant form \nof external financing, few SMEs in the region have access to bank lending (and mostly only for \nworking capital). Lack of access to bank lending is considered in most DMCs as the main \nfinancing difficulty and a stumbling block to the sustained growth of SMEs. As seen in Figure 2, \nthe situation in Georgia is no different.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Georgian  Daily.

", "  7\nFigure 2: Constraints to Firm Investment \n \n(% of firms identifying problem as their greatest obstacle) \nSource: Enterprise Surveys Website (2008). \n \n15.  Growth in the SME sector has been severely curtailed by these financing constraints, \nwhich have been further exacerbated by the events in the latter part of 2008. As Table 5 shows, \nonly 17% of bank lending in 2007 went to SMEs, and by September 2008 this figure had \nincreased only slightly, to 21%.8 The problem derives in part from constraints on the SMEs \nthemselves,  such  as  their  lack  of  collateral,  proper  bookkeeping,  and  financial  reporting. \nAnother problem is the high demand for bank credit, which far outstrips the supply from banks, \nmany of which have traditionally shown a risk-averse bias to SME lending. The World Bank \nnotes that access to banks is a problem for SMEs and larger companies alike; of the 12 regions \nin Georgia, half have fewer than one bank branch for every 100,000 citizens.9 Georgian banks \nhave started to look increasingly at the SME sector as a promising business opportunity\u2014\nparticularly in the aftermath of the conflict and global crisis\u2014given the relative resilience of \nSMEs (based on borrower performance); this is a strategic move that is well aligned with the \neconomic needs of the country, as well as with the main drivers of economic growth (agriculture, \nmachinery, etc.), which are often led by SMEs. \n                                                 \n8  Data provided via email by Nika Chlaidze of the Financial Services Authority. \n9  World Bank.

Investment Identification and Selection \n \n16.  After Georgia joined ADB as a member in February 2007, the Government of Georgia \narranged  introductory  meetings  between  the  Private  Sector  Capital  Markets  and  Financial \nSectors  Division  (PSCM)  of  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  and  top  Georgian \ncommercial  banks,  following  initial  meetings  held  with  the  ADB  Central  and  West  Asia \nDepartment. Based on those meetings, PSCM selected four banks from among the top seven \nfor consideration based on their financial condition, business focus, and expressed need for \nfunding\u2014Bank of Georgia, People\u2019s Bank of Georgia, TBC, and Bank Republic.  \n \n17.  In the aftermath of the Russian conflict and the global economic downturn, lending \nactivity in the Georgian banking sector has been severely curtailed as funding sources have \ndwindled. In view of the need for lending activities to resume in order to assist in the recovery of \nthe real economy, PSCM has considered possible interventions. Two such interventions are \nbeing investigated\u2014a new facility to Bank Republic and another loan to Bank of Georgia, given \ntheir presence in the market, extensive distribution networks, and established track record with \ncommercial and SME lending.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency  with  ADB's  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020) \n \n18.  Development of the financial sector is essential to ensuring sustainable private-sector-\nled economic growth. Moreover, without access to formal financial services and sustainable \nsocial insurance (including pensions), the poor will be excluded from the growth process and its \nbenefits. Under Strategy 202010, ADB seeks to strengthen its support to the financial sector at \nthe regional and national levels by helping to develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and \nproducts  and  services.  To  promote  inclusive  growth,  it  will  seek  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for microfinance, rural finance institutions, and SMEs, and will explore the use of \ntechnologies to expand the reach of the formal financial system to rural areas. Through such \ninitiatives,  ADB  will  continue  to  assist  in  channeling  the  region's  savings  into  the  most \nproductive investments\u2014in particular, development of the capital markets\u2014as well as continue \nto build the capacity of financial institutions by introducing international best practices. The \nproposed loan will provide systemic support for the Georgian banking sector by contributing to \nthe renewal of lending activities, notably to SMEs, which is an essential component of the \ncountry's economic recovery and is directly in line with Strategy 2020.  \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. ", "      9\n  2.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n \n19.  Although ADB does not yet have a country partnership strategy for Georgia, it has an \ninterim operational strategy,11 under which it suggests lending to, or making equity investments \nin,  private  banks,  or  making  equity  investments  in  leasing  companies  and  other  nonbank \nfinancial institutions or providing credit lines to them. The proposed intervention is in keeping \nwith this strategy, as the loan to Bank Republic will support private sector development by \nincreasing access to financing for SMEs. The proposed intervention also ties in to the recently \napproved Georgia Growth Recovery Support Program,12 which outlines current difficulties in the \nGeorgian banking sector and their impact on the broader economy. Again, the proposed loan \nseeks  to  provide  systemic  support  to  the  Georgian  banking  sector  during  this  challenging \nperiod, not only by providing financing but also by building confidence in the broader financial \nsector.  \n \n  3.  Consistency with Sector Strategy \n \n20.  Supporting financial sector development is a key focus of development assistance for \nADB, in line with the tenets detailed in ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy13 and \nEnhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy,14 which note improved economic growth, stimulated by \nprivate sector investment, as a key contributing factor in reducing poverty. ADB\u2019s private sector \ndevelopment strategy refers specifically to ADB's role in strengthening the financial sector in \nDMCs. The strategy notes the critical importance of well-functioning financial systems for the \ndevelopment of the private sector, which in turn underpins sustainable economic growth. Many \nDMCs need to strengthen their financial institutions and create diversified financial markets that \ncan finance private-sector-led growth. ADB has supported financial sector reform programs \nthrough public sector operations and/or direct investments in financial intermediaries in several \nDMCs through its Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD). The proposed ADB loan is \nconsistent with the overall sector strategy in that it will assist in the development of the Georgian \nbanking sector and increase access to financing for SMEs, thereby making private sector \ndevelopment more sustainable and ADB\u2019s mission of poverty reduction more achievable. The \nproposed loan is also aligned with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, which states that ADB \nseeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems and capital markets,\u201d since these are \nseen as \u201cindispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing savings, and ensuring availability \nof long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth.\u201d \n \nD.  Development Impact \n \n  1.  Impact \n \n21.  The development impacts of the proposed transaction will include the following: \n \n(i)  Support for Georgian banking sector. The proposed intervention will provide \nsystemic  support  to  the  Georgian  banking  sector  at  a  critical  point  in  its \ndevelopment and help to renew confidence in the country\u2019s banking system. \nLending  activity  among  the  banks  in  Georgia  has  all  but  stopped  as  a \nconsequence of the conflict and global crisis. As banks are a key source of small \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008. Georgia: Interim Operational Strategy, 2008\u20132009. Manila. \n12 ADB. 2009.

SMEs play a significant \nrole in all of ADB\u2019s DMC economies, as they are key drivers of employment, \neconomic growth, and development. SME development is therefore an important \nengine  of  growth  and  a  key  contributor  to  poverty  reduction  through  the \nemployment, increase in individual incomes, and tax revenues it generates. The \nproposed assistance will allow Bank Republic to increase financial intermediation \nto SMEs, in line with its strategic plans and ADB's mission. \n \n(iii)  Private sector development. As banks are a key source of small and micro \nloans for the private sector, in particular to individual entrepreneurs and SMEs, \nthey  are  crucial  to  the  recovery  of  the  Georgian  economy.  The  proposed \nintervention will contribute to private sector development in Georgia by helping to \nmobilize liquidity and channel it towards the most productive investments through \nthe extension of credit. \n \n2.  Outcome and Output \n \n    a.  Outcome \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s debt funding will result in Bank Republic being able to renew its lending activities, \nwhich will contribute to increasing confidence in the banking sector, and provide increased, \nsustainable  access  to  finance  to  SMEs  in  Georgia  in  line  with  Bank  Republic's  strategic \nbusiness objectives. Indicators of this include the following: (i) business performance of the \nproject itself (commercial viability with example measures such as profitability, return on equity, \nnet interest margin, and asset growth), and (ii) economic sustainability (provision of financial \nservices to viable private enterprises and allocation of resources with example measures such \nas increasing lending to SMEs, asset quality, and disbursements in rural areas). \n \n    b.  Output \n \n23.  ADB will provide a senior loan to Bank Republic, which will effectively use the proceeds \nto expand its SME loan portfolio. \n \nIII.  FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \n24.  Bank Republic is a closed joint-stock company, which was established in 1991 and \nincorporated in Georgia in 1992. The bank's primary business consists of commercial activities, \noriginating loans and guarantees, attracting customer deposits, and trading activities, which are \nprovided by the bank through its distribution network of 26 branches and 19 service centers \nthroughout the country. As of 30 June 2009, Bank Republic was the third-largest bank in \nGeorgia  in  terms  of  assets,  with  GEL756.0  million  in  total  assets  and  a  loan  portfolio  of \nGEL557.6 million. Bank Republic\u2019s primary focus until 2005 was corporate banking, particularly \nserving Georgia\u2019s larger corporations. However, since its acquisition by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in \n2006, the bank has sought to position itself better in the market and make the transition to \nuniversal banking, offering retail banking services and expanding its corporate banking activities \nto include SMEs. Bank Republic seeks to build on its presence in the Georgian banking sector \nand gain market share in retail and SME banking by leveraging its association with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \nG\u00e9n\u00e9rale and adopting international best practices in its operations.  ", "      11\nA.  Ownership \n \n25.  In October 2006, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale acquired a 60% stake in Bank Republic. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \nG\u00e9n\u00e9rale is one of the largest financial services groups in Europe, employing 163,000 people \nworldwide in three key businesses: (i) retail banking and financial services, (ii) global investment \nmanagement and services, and (iii) corporate and investment banking. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is \nrated Aa2 by Moody\u2019s, A+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s, and A+ by Fitch Ratings. \n \n26.  Concurrently, the EBRD also purchased 10% of the bank. Bank Republic's third key \nshareholder is Lasha Papashvili, the former chief executive officer of the bank who is now chair \nof its supervisory council and is also involved with a leading real estate development company \nin Georgia (Redix). Table 6 lists Bank Republic\u2019s shareholders. \n \nTable 6: Principal Bank Republic Shareholders, as of 30 June 2009 \n(%) \nShareholder  Shareholding \nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  60.0 \nLasha Papashvili  25.0 \nEBRD  10.0 \nGocha Matsaberidze  5.0 \n  Total  100.0 \nEBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \nSource: Bank Republic. \n \nB.  Business Overview  \n \n1.  Business Operations \n \n27.  Bank  Republic  offers  a  full  suite  of  corporate  and  retail  loan  products.  Corporate \nproducts include (i) unsecured loans, (ii) single loans, (iii) formal and revolving credit lines, (iv) \noverdrafts, (v) guarantees, and (vi) letters of credit. Each credit product is generally structured \nas short term (up to 12 months), medium term (1\u20135 years), or long term (more than 5 years), \ndepending on purpose (i.e., working capital financing versus property development). The bank \nalso offers a range of retail loan products in four general categories: (i) personal loans (for \npersonal needs including consumer lending through partner merchants), (ii) auto loans, (iii) \nmortgage loans, and (iv) micro loans.  \n \n  2.  Credit Ratings \n \n28.  Bank Republic is currently unrated. The bank intended to approach Moody\u2019s for an initial \ncredit rating before year-end 2008; however, given the change in operating environment, it \npostponed this until a later time. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s loan. ADB is contemplating extending a senior loan of up to $20 million to Bank \nRepublic, with a tenor of up to 4 years, for the purpose of onlending to SMEs in Georgia. The \nloan will have a grace period of 1 year and an availability period of 1 year and will be repaid \nsemiannually. The proposed loan, without government guarantee, will be sourced from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and will carry an interest rate based on the London interbank offered \n ", "12   \nrate plus a margin determined by ADB\u2019s investment committee. The committee will also determine \nthe up-front and commitment fees. The proposed loan will be unsecured. \n \n30.  The  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement,  which  will  contain  terms  and \nconditions  standard  for  private  sector  loans  without  government  guarantees,  as  well  as \ncovenants relating to ADB policies.15 The proposed loan will be subject to conditions precedent \nto the disbursement, including all necessary government, creditor, and shareholder approvals \nand consents, and all contractual and financial arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The loan \nagreement will include appropriate (i) representations and warranties; (ii) covenants, including \naffirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events of default. \n \n31.  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale guarantee. The commercial risks associated with the proposed loan \nwill be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the majority shareholder of \nBank Republic. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is currently rated Aa2 by Moody\u2019s, A+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s, \nand A+ by Fitch Ratings. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n \n32.  Justification for the proposed ADB loan is based on the following considerations: \n \n(i)  Systemic  support  for  Georgian  banking  sector.  The  proposed  loan  will \nprovide systemic support to the Georgian banking sector at a critical point in its \ndevelopment and help to renew confidence in the country\u2019s banking system. \nLending  activity  among  the  banks  in  Georgia  has  all  but  stopped  as  a \nconsequence  of  the  conflict  and  global  crisis,  as  well  as  their  interest  in \nmaintaining additional liquidity. As banks are a key source of small and micro \nloans for the private sector, in particular for individual entrepreneurs and SMEs, \nthey are crucial to the recovery of the Georgian economy.  \n \n(ii)  Increase  access  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  financing.  The \nproposed transaction will foster Bank Republic\u2019s SME financing operations by \nproviding debt funding needed for renewal of lending to this particular sector. \nThis will in turn help to expand the SME sector itself, which is a main force \nbehind economic growth in Georgia and contributes significantly to employment \ncreation.   \n \n(iii)  Catalyze foreign funds into Georgia. In conjunction with market support from \nother international financial institutions, ADB's proposed loan will provide a signal \nof confidence in the underlying fundamentals of the Georgian economy and the \nbanking sector during the current period of uncertainty and help to catalyze a \nreturn of foreign investment into the country.  \n \n(iv)  Support of foreign investment. ADB's proposed loan and its coverage of the \npolitical risks in the transaction will also provide support to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's \nlong-term objective of expanding its role in the development of the Georgian \nbanking sector and in expanding SME lending in particular. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \nperceives ADB's relationship with the Government of Georgia as providing it \nsome  measure  of  comfort  for  the  political  risks  associated  with  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \n                                                 \n15 These covenants include compliance with ADB (i) environmental and social safeguard policies; and (ii) combating \nmoney laundering and financing of terrorism, and anticorruption policies. ", "      13\nG\u00e9n\u00e9rale's participation, as a private sector entity, in the country's economic \ndevelopment.   \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n33.  The proposed loan is classified as category FI under ADB's Environment Policy (2002) \nand as category C under both ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). Bank Republic has already adopted an environmental and social \nmanagement system in accordance with EBRD guidelines. ADB will review such environmental \nand social management system to ensure that it is compliant with ADB's Environment Policy \n(2002) and the guidelines in Appendix 5. If Bank Republic is not in compliance, it will be \nrequired to make the necessary changes.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n34.  Monitoring. The proposed terms of the loan agreement will require Bank Republic to \nprovide the following information: (i) unaudited quarterly financial statements; (ii) audited annual \nfinancial statements; (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for agreed-upon financial covenants; \nand (iv) quarterly reports on the sub-borrowers. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n35.  Bank Republic was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require Bank Republic to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and Bank Republic will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \nD.  Investment Limitations \n \n36.  The proposed transaction, once approved and signed, will increase ADB's projected \nnonsovereign exposure for 2009 to $4.39 billion based on the 30 September 2009 outstanding \namount and the projected disbursements until 31 December 2009. Exposure to Georgia will \nincrease to $36.67 million or 0.84% of total projected nonsovereign operations portfolio, while \nthe exposure to the capital market subsector will increase to $57.74 million or 1.32% of total \nprojected nonsovereign operations portfolio. The proposed financing is within ADB\u2019s country, \nindustry, single, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign transactions. ADB will ensure that \nnonsovereign exposure will be kept within the nonsovereign exposure limit. \n \nE.  Assurances \n \n37.  No-objection  letter.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (the Charter)16, the government will be asked to confirm that it has no \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 1966.

Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nGeorgia's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program (2003\u20132015)a set forth the country's first long-term \ndevelopment strategy. Although the program provided a framework for poverty reduction, it lacked clear prioritization and \nimplementation was hampered by limited government resources. Following the presidential election in 2008, the government \nissued a 5-year program of key priorities for 2008\u20132012\u2014United Georgia Without Poverty\u2014which identified a number of \npolitical, economic, and social objectives including (i) social programs (spending one-third of the state budget on social \nprograms during 2008\u20132012), (ii) generating employment (creating 200,000 new jobs during 2008\u20132012), and (iii) reducing \npoverty (halving the number of social program beneficiaries during 2008\u20132012, increasing the minimum monthly pension to \n$100 during 2008\u20132012, and providing access to state-funded health insurance for 1.2 million people, including socially \nvulnerable, teachers, military and law enforcement personnel, and employees of state agencies). The government has set a \ngoal of reducing the poverty rate to 15% by 2015. \n \nGeorgia has implemented far-reaching and strategic reforms during 2003\u20132008 with impressive results. The key outcomes \n(prior to the onset of the conflict with the Russian Federation and the global economic crisis) were as follows: (i) increased \nforeign direct investment from 8.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005 to 16% in 2007; (ii) higher tax revenue \ncollection from 14.1% of GDP in 2003 to 25.8% in 2007; (iii) increased social spending by more than 5%; (iv) increased \nelectricity generation and transmission from a net deficit to a net exporter; and (v) establishment of a social assistance \nprogram covering 148,000 households with over 600,000 beneficiaries. As a result of such efforts, the official poverty rate in \nGeorgia declined from 24.1% in 2005 to 23.3% in 2006 and to 21.3% in 2007; however, World Bank figures indicate a poverty \nrate of 23.6% in 2007. Despite the progress in reducing poverty during this period, it is expected that the poverty rate will \nincrease in the interim period as a result of the two crises, which have resulted in the internal displacement of 130,000 people. \nIn addition, over 150,000 people have been adversely affected by difficulties related to the lack of irrigation water following the \nRussian conflict.  \n \n2.  Design Features \n \nPro-poor. Through its support for financial sector and SME development, the project will support the goal of reducing poverty \nindirectly by contributing to economic growth and directly by helping to improve access to finance, which will create \nemployment opportunities, provide more investment in human capital, and smooth consumption. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. ADB's interim operational report on Georgia (2008\u20132009)b indicates that \"relatively high rates of urban \nunemployment and of rural underemployment contribute to the persistence of poverty. Net job creation rates have been found \nto be highest in small private firms, as the large privatized enterprises are downsizing and shedding labor. However, \nprivatized  large enterprises  still dominate  output  and employment. Greater focus is needed  on  creating an  enabling \nenvironment for the development of small firms to boost net new job creation. This calls for addressing the constraints that \nsuch enterprises face, such as the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises face bigger hurdles in accessing finance than \nlarger firms. In addition to strengthening the institutional environment, the access of such enterprises to capital also can be \nimproved by (i) diversifying financial services offered, (ii) broadening the types of collateral that can be accepted by banks, (iii) \nreducing  costs  associated  with  evaluation  of  credit  information,  and  (iv)  establishing  effective  systems  for  enforcing \nrepayment.\" \n \n ", "18  Appendix 2 \nB.

The economic downturn in Georgia turned out to be deeper than originally expected. \nWhile GDP growth in 2008 was a modest 2.1%, the consequences of the conflict with the \nRussian Federation and the global economic crisis continued through the first half of 2009. Real \ngross domestic product (GDP) data indicates that the Georgian economy contracted by 5.9% \n(year-on-year) during the first quarter of 2009 and by a further 10.7% (year-on-year) in the \nsecond quarter due to the ongoing decline in exports and remittances, and the contraction in \nbank lending by 10.0% since the end of 2008. While the contraction affected most sectors of the \neconomy, retail trade, manufacturing, and construction contributed most to the decline, leading \nto significantly reduced employment and incomes. 1 \n \n2.  Inflation \n \n2.  Against  the  background  of  a  broad  decline  in  economic  activity  and  falling  global \ncommodity prices, inflationary pressures have dissipated. Inflation was 5.5% (year-on-year) for \n2008, as compared with 10.9% in 2007 (year-on-year), and 12-month inflation was only 2.3% as \nof 30 June 2009 (Table A4.1).  \n \nTableA4.1: Georgia Economic Indicators  \nItem  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nGDP at market prices (GEL billion)  8.6  9.8  11.6  13.8  16.5  19.1 \nGDP ($ billion)  4.0  5.1  6.4  7.7  9.8  12.8 \nReal GDP growth (%)  11.1  5.9  9.6  9.4  12.4  2.1 \nConsumer price inflation, average \n4.8  5.7  8.3  9.2  9.2  10.0 \n(%) \nPopulation (million)  4.6  4.5  4.5  4.4  4.4  4.3 \nExports of goods, FOB ($ million)  830.5  1,092.1  1,472.4  1,666.6  2,104.3  2,427.9 \nImports of goods, FOB ($ million)  (1,468.7)  (2,007.6)  (2,686.6)  (3,685.9)  (4,976.5)  (6,261.2) \nCurrent account balance ($ million)  (383.6)  (420.7)  (762.7)  (1,235.4)  (2,043.9)  (3,169.9) \nForeign exchange reserves, \n196.2  386.7  478.6  930.8  1,361.2  1,480.2 \nexcluding gold ($ million) \nForeign direct investment ($ million)  331  483  542  1,076  2,015  1,564 \nTotal external debt ($ million)  2,035  2,088  2,657  3,503  4,243  7,711 \nDebt-service ratio, paid (%)  14.5  16.6a  14.8  14.4  16.0   \nExchange rate, average (GEL:$)  2.15  1.92  1.81  1.78  1.67  1.49 \n( ) = negative, FOB = free on board, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Economist Intelligence Unit, Fitch Ratings, Georgia Department of Statistics. \n \n3.  Foreign Exchange \n \n3.  The foreign exchange market has stabilized since mid-February 2009, reflecting an \neasing of balance of payment pressures. The external current account deficit has narrowed \nfaster than expected, led by declining imports. Capital inflows have also fallen short of earlier \nprojections. Foreign direct investment, the main driver of economic activity in Georgia for the \npast several years, fell by approximately 70.0% in the first half of 2009 relative to the same \n                                                 \n1  Excerpts taken from International Monetary Fund. 2009.

The \nstabilization of the foreign exchange market, which coincided with the return to auctions instead \nof fixing sessions, allowed the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) to acquire foreign exchange \nfrom the market in March\u2013April 2009 and to limit its foreign exchange sales in May\u2013June 2009 \nto $34 million as compared with $130 million in January\u2013February 2009. \n \n4.  Monetary Policy \n \n4.  Monetary conditions remain very tight, notwithstanding policy loosening, with monetary \nand credit aggregates contracting through the first half of 2009 and real deposit interest rates \nrising to 8.5%. Deposit rates have increased since the outset of the crisis as banks compete for \na shrinking deposit base. Unlike in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, the contraction of \nmonetary aggregates appears to reflect mostly a drawdown of financial savings by households \nand enterprises rather than a loss of confidence. Despite stabilization in deposits and deposit \ndollarization since mid-May, banks have continued to curtail credit to preserve adequate liquidity \nbuffers in the face of ongoing uncertainty and heightened credit risk. With increased credit risk, \nintermediation margins widened steadily through February 2009, but have since come down. \nNBG's refinancing rate has been lowered repeatedly, but with limited eligible collateral available \nfor accessing this window, this has only led to a widening gap between market rates and the \npolicy rate. \n \n5.  Fiscal Policy \n \n5.  Due to cuts in defense spending, public expenditures were 11.0% lower during the first \nhalf of 2009 as compared with the same period in 2008. Despite the strict control of public \nexpenditures, spending reductions in the first half of 2009 were outpaced by the decline in tax \nrevenues by a substantial margin. Tax revenues declined by 17.0% in the first 6 months of \n2009, in part due to the reduction of personal income tax rates from 25.0% to 20.0%, as well as \nthe reductions of taxes on interest and dividend income paid to nonresidents. \n \n  6.  Financial Sector \n \n6.  The financial sector has been resilient thus far, helped by external financial support; \nhowever, it remains susceptible to further deterioration in asset quality, as well as continued \nuncertainty about the deposit base. The share of nonperforming loans in total loans has risen by \n15  percentage  points  since  June  2008.  So  far,  domestic  currency  loans  have  been \ndisproportionately affected, but stress testing indicates the vulnerability of the loan portfolio to \nfurther exchange rate depreciation. Faced with deposit outflows and little prospect for additional \nrecapitalization in the short term, banks have continued to build up precautionary balances. \nAlthough the banks\u2019 cautious attitude to lending has prudential benefits, given very high loan\u2013\ndeposit ratios, it is placing additional strains on the economy. \n \nB.  Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks \n   \n  1.  Gross Domestic Product Growth and Inflation \n \n7.  Based on a moderate recovery of activity, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects \nreal GDP growth in Georgia to rebound to 2.0% in 2010. Over the medium term, real GDP \ngrowth is projected to rise gradually to 5.0%, capitalizing on a recovery of world growth, given \nthe country's geographical location as a natural transit point of world trade in goods and energy, \n ", "22  Appendix 3 \nvery favorable business environment, flexible economic institutions, and demonstrated capacity \nfor timely policy action.  \n \n8.  These projections are, however, predicated on the size of the economic contraction in \n2009, the timing and pace of economic recovery, and the resumption of private capital flows. \nFurther  declines  in  private  capital  inflows,  exports,  and  remittances,  as  well  as  delays  or \nshortfalls in official assistance, or prolonged domestic and regional political tensions could result \nin a deeper contraction in 2009 than currently forecast. \n \n9.  Inflation is expected to edge up as growth resumes, although still remain below the pre-\ncrises level at 5.0% in the medium term. \n \n  2.  Foreign Exchange \n \n10.  While foreign exchange pressures have eased recently, they could reemerge in the \nevent of financing shortfalls, and the combined effect of output contraction and lari depreciation \nwould have repercussions on the banking sector, which is exposed to highly dollarized balance \nsheets of unhedged borrowers. For now, however, the Government of Georgia expects the \nforeign exchange market to remain relatively stable through the remainder of 2009, aided by \nsmoother exchange rate adjustment associated with the auction system. \n \n  3.  Monetary Policy \n \n11.  With limited scope for reviving credit growth through interest rate cuts and liquidity \ninjections, Georgia's short-term monetary strategy is to ease credit conditions through selective \ninstruments such as foreign exchange swaps, in an effort to encourage domestic currency \nlending.  Meanwhile,  liquidity  injections  from  external  budgetary  support  will  be  allowed  to \nincrease reserve money sufficiently to meet banks\u2019 demand for higher precautionary balances. \n \n  4.  Fiscal Policy \n \n12.  Georgia's fiscal deficit is projected to increase from the original projection of 5.6% of \nGDP to 9.4% in 2009, due mainly to the downward revision in GDP growth. Fiscal deficits in the \nsecond half of 2009 and in 2010 will be financed by a mix of T-bill issuance, privatization \nreceipts, and external budget support. Part of the balance of payments support provided by the \nIMF in 2009 ($100 million) will be channeled to the budget. In 2010, all of the IMF financing is \nprovisionally channeled to the budget pending confirmation of the amount of budget support that \nis in the pipeline from other international financial institutions. Beyond 2010, the adjustment \nstrategy will continue to rely on containing expenditure and broadening the tax base while \nfurther reducing income tax rates once conditions permit. \n \n ", "                      Appendix 4 23\n      \nGUARANTOR: SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 G\u00c9N\u00c9RALE \n \nA.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n1.  Overview. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group,1 one of the leading universal banks in Europe, \nhas the seventh-largest market capitalization in the euro zone and a broad global presence, with \n163,000 employees in 82 countries, serving 30 million individual customers worldwide. \n \n2.  Business operations. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is focused on four key business areas: (i) retail \nbanking; (ii) financial services (consumer credit, equipment finance, vehicle finance, information \ntechnology  leasing,  insurance);  (iii)  global  investment  management  and  services  (asset \nmanagement,  private  banking,  securities  services,  online  banking);  and  (iv)  corporate  and \ninvestment banking, in which Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale ranks among the leading banks worldwide in \neuro capital markets, derivatives, and structured finance.  \n \n3.  Business strategy. The group has three strategic priorities: (i) maintaining a balanced \nbusiness mix, (ii) achieving long-term growth, and (iii) increasing operating efficiency. To carry \nout these priorities, the group\u2019s strategy for 2008\u20132010 includes increasing development in \nhigh-potential businesses and markets (international expansion of retail banking and consumer \ncredit, and private banking), to be funded through high capital generation from its French \nnetworks  and  its  corporate  and  investment  banking  business.  The  group\u2019s  international \nexpansion in the long term will focus on retail banking in the Russian Federation, Central and \nEastern Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin, and on consumer banking activity in the BRIC \n(Brazil, Russian Federation, India, People\u2019s Republic of China) countries and other emerging \nmarkets. The strategy also includes enhancing revenue synergies between businesses, and \nreinforcing security and operational efficiency to ensure robust, profitable, and balanced growth.  \n \n8.  Business  performance.  The  year  2007  was  a  difficult  one  for  financial  markets \nworldwide; the subprime crisis and follow-on liquidity crisis had far-reaching effects. The group \nwas not immune to these problems; in the second half of 2007, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s corporate \nand investment banking was affected by fallout from the United States financial crisis, and its \nasset management group was affected by the liquidity crisis. Moreover, the group suffered from \nfraud committed by a rogue trader in its capital market activities, resulting in an exceptional loss \nof \u20ac4.9 billion. These difficulties affected both revenue, which was down 2.8% from 2006,2 and \nnet income, which was down 81.9% from 2006. Despite these challenges, the group had a \nprofitable year in 2007, earning net income of \u20ac947 million. This strong performance was driven \nby its diverse range of activities, the positive performance of its retail banking networks, and the \nstrong growth of its financial services, private banking, and securities services activities. The \nafter-tax return on equity was 3.6% (17.1% excluding the effects of the fraud).  \n \n9.  Despite the deepening of the global economic crisis in 2008, the group reported net \nincome  of  \u20ac2,773  million  as  of  year-end  2008.  Earnings  were  supported  by  the  group's \nperformance in the retail banking business, both in France and internationally, as well as its \nfinancial services, custody, futures brokerage, and online banking business lines. As of 30 June \n2009, the group's net income rebounded to positive levels following negative earnings in the first \nquarter of 2009, related to credit costs and securities write-downs.
