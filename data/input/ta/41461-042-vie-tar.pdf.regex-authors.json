INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since 2006, the Government of Viet Nam has discussed with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) the need to take steps to \nprotect rural infrastructure from the anticipated effects of climate change. In support of this need, \nthe Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) invited \nUNDP and ADB to submit a proposal for a parallel financed technical assistance (TA) project \nentitled Promoting Climate Resilient Rural Infrastructure in Northern Mountain Provinces of \nViet Nam.1 The SCCF/GEF requested ADB to take the lead role in preparing the TA project. The \nSCCF/GEF will provide a total of $3.4 million for the TA project. The Ministry of Agriculture and \nRural Development (MARD) will execute it in concert with the implementation of the ADB loan \nfunded Sustainable Rural Infrastructure Development Project in Northern Mountain Provinces \n(SRIDP).2 The SRIDP project management will be expanded to cover the TA project.3 \n2.  The TA project will have common geographic targeting and consist of five components. \nUNDP will carry out four components estimated to cost $1.4 million, over a 4-year period.4 The \nADB-administered  component  is  estimated  to  cost  $2  million  and  is  prepared  as  capacity \ndevelopment TA.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA proposal was \nthoroughly reviewed with MARD in January 2011. A memorandum of understanding for the ADB \ncomponent was signed with MARD on 21 January 2011. ADB submitted the TA proposal to the \nSCCF/GEF in February 2011. Approval for the TA project was received from the SCCF/GEF on \n23 April 2012. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Since  the  mid-1990s,  the  government  has  been  engaged  in  a  program  of  rural \ninfrastructure development with funding from ADB, the World Bank, the government\u2019s own \nresources, and other development partners. The positive results of this program to date have \ncontributed (along with other factors) to improvements in the standard of living of a large portion \nof the rural population and a decline in poverty from 53% in 1993 to 16% in 2008.  \n \n4.  Viet  Nam  is  one  of  the  most  disaster-prone  countries  in  the  world.  It  suffers  from \ntyphoons, floods, droughts, and landslides. Flooding and landslides triggered by typhoons are \nthe most prevalent natural disasters.6 Many of Viet Nam\u2019s rivers, especially in mountainous \nareas, are short and steep. Heavy rainfall in their upper catchment areas thus produces intense, \nshort duration flash floods that frequently occur without warning, taking lives and destroying \ninfrastructure, houses, and farmland in their path. From 1995 to 2005, storms caused 6,000 \ndeaths, destroyed 320,000 houses, and resulted in capital stock loss of more than $2.5 billion, \n                                                \n1 The definition of parallel financed projects is provided in ADB. 2003.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Sustainable Rural Infrastructure Development Project in Northern Mountain Provinces. \nManila. \n3 The TA was originally attached to the SRIDP, but at the time of circulation of the SRIDP for Board consideration \n(September 2010), SCCF/GEF funding was not confirmed. Consequently, the TA needed to be detached from the \nSRIDP and processed as a standalone TA. \n4 The four UNDP components are (i) mainstreaming of climate risk reduction into policy formulation and infrastructure \ndevelopment planning, (ii) capacity development to increase understanding about current and emerging climate \nrisks and to promote the use of climate resilience techniques during local planning activities, (iii) dissemination of \nlessons learned and best practices, and (iv) project management. \n5 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 June 2011. \n6 On the average, four to six typhoons hit Viet Nam each year and batter the eastern seaboard over much of its    \n3,260-kilometer length, causing extensive damage to a wide range of rural infrastructure: bridges, roads, irrigation \nworks, market places, and schools. \n ", "2 \n \nrepresenting about 5% of gross annual capital formation.7 These problems are expected to \nworsen with increasing climate fluctuation and intensification of climate events. In response, the \ngovernment launched the National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change. \n \n5.  The ADB-funded investments in rural infrastructure mostly consist of roads, irrigation, \nmarkets, water supply, and post-harvest facilities. Rural infrastructure is particularly vulnerable \nto damage caused by climate change-attributed impacts. The most potentially damaging effect \nis increased intensities and duration of rainfall causing increases in the volume and velocity of \nsurface water movement. This can cause severe erosion, leading to rural infrastructure damage. \nThe damage results in high maintenance and rehabilitation costs as well as the loss of benefits \nwhile rural infrastructure remains in poor condition. At present, few mainstreamed measures are \npracticed in Viet Nam that can affordably prevent or mitigate these impacts.   \n \n6.  There are, however, a range of engineering options to counter the anticipated impacts of \nclimate  change  on  rural  infrastructure.  Options  range  from  technically  sophisticated  civil \nengineering approaches to far less costly bioengineering approaches. Selection of the most \nappropriate option needs to be done within a susceptibility\u2013hazard\u2013risk framework.8 For rural \ninfrastructure, where the risk of failure is usually less catastrophic in comparison to that of major \ninfrastructure, solutions need to be low-cost and maximize local inputs.  \n \n7.  Bioengineering  approaches  are  low-cost  techniques  that  involve  the  protection  of \nexposed earth surfaces and structures through the use of live vegetation complemented by \nsimple  civil  works.  These  measures  provide  a  low-cost  means  of  supplementing  current \ntechnical  standards  to  prevent  soil  erosion  and  to  reduce  slope  instability  in  hilly  areas. \nBioengineering entails an element of carbon capture, and thus contributes to counter the causes \nof climate change. This approach is highly labor-intensive and can provide employment and \nlivelihood opportunities for rural people, increasing their capacities to cope with the impacts of \nclimate change. The application of bioengineering approaches could be quickly scaled up. \n \n8.  There is a need to demonstrate and mainstream measures that can be taken to reduce \nanticipated climate change impacts on rural infrastructure. The demonstrations should illustrate \nthe value of low-cost, climate-resilient techniques selected according to specific site conditions. \nThe techniques should be demonstrated in provinces that represent different environments and \nanticipated  climate  change  effects.  Demonstrations  are  needed  on  different  kinds  of  rural \ninfrastructure such as roads, irrigation structures, and river embankments. This will enable the \ncompilation of a range of environments and infrastructure to match with an array of appropriate \napproaches.  Knowledge  dissemination  and  communication  strategy  and  action  plans  are \nneeded to guide the flow of information about the demonstrations to the stakeholders. \n \n9.  The demonstrations should seek to optimize the potential social benefits, particularly for \nthe poor and for women. They should rely on local resources that can be sustainably sourced \nfrom nearby communities. Careful selection and use of materials\u2014such as specific plants that \ncan be used for food, animal fodder, or medicinal purposes\u2014will enhance the interests of local \npeople in maintaining the condition of the sites in the long term. Construction or landscaping \noperations should be designed optimizing labor-based approaches to provide local employment \nopportunities.9 \n \n                                                \n7 World Bank. 2005.

ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 identifies: (i) infrastructure; and (ii) environment, including climate \nchange, as two of ADB\u2019s five core operational areas.10 Rehabilitation of rural infrastructure has \nbeen a component of ADB\u2019s lending program in Viet Nam through the past three country \nstrategies and continues to be a component of the draft country partnership strategy, 2011\u2013\n2015 lending pipeline. The Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment\u2019s  Assessment, \nStrategy and Roadmap identifies two interrelated priorities: (i) enhanced rural productivity, which \nincludes  improving  productive  rural  infrastructure;  and  (ii)  environmental  sustainability  and \nclimate change resilience. The measures envisioned in the TA conform to these ADB policy and \nstrategic priorities. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be improved climate resilience of rural infrastructure. Indicators \nof the impact are (i) increased use of climate resilient rural infrastructure approaches (from 0% \nto at least 70% by December 2020); and (ii) deterioration rates of the demonstration sites are \nlower than those of the control sites (75% lower by December 2020). \n \n12.   The outcome of the TA will be effective climate-resilience measures mainstreamed into \nthe  MARD  rural  infrastructure  program.  The  approaches  developed\u2014including  promising \nmodifications, alternatives, and lessons learned\u2014will be utilized by MARD rural infrastructure \ninvestments as standard practice in 100% of new ADB-financed projects by the end of the TA. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) identification of low-cost climate-proofing \nmeasures suitable for rural infrastructure in northern Viet Nam; (ii) demonstration of climate \nchange resilient techniques in the provinces of Bac Kan and Son La on two rural roads, one \nirrigation  scheme,  and  one  river  embankment; 11 (iii)  establishment  of  a  trained  cadre  of \ntechnical personnel familiar with the protection measures; (iv) preparation of recommendations \nfor the integration of the demonstrated approaches into  training curricula, standard design \nprocedures,  and  contract  specifications;  and  (v)  identification  of  climate  change  risks  and \nvulnerabilities, and the potential for applying the measures used in the demonstrations for \nstrengthening the resilience of nearby communities. \n \n14.  Key assumptions include the following: (i) MARD will carry out further pilot testing under \ndifferent conditions\u2014to be able to adapt the approaches to the wide range of environmental \nconditions  found  in  Viet  Nam,  and  (ii)  demonstrations  under  the  TA  are  successful  and \nconvincing.12  \n \n15.  Identified  risks  include  the  following:  (i)  MARD  fails  to  continue  monitoring  the \ndemonstration and control sites after completion of the TA, (ii) actual climate change impacts \nare outside the assumed envelope at TA inception, (iii) demonstration results are undermined \nby  factors  outside  of  the  TA  control  (this  could  include  changes  in  land  use  within  the \ndemonstration sites\u2019 areas of influence), (iv) conservative views within MARD and the provincial \ndepartments of agriculture and rural development cause resistance to changes in practice (more \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2008.

Cost and Financing \n16.  The government has requested UNDP to finance and administer $1,400,000 equivalent \nand ADB to finance and administer $2,000,000 equivalent (the TA). The TA project will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the SCCF/GEF. The government will provide counterpart support \nin  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  the  cost  of  long-term  monitoring  of  the \ndemonstrations, and the costs of any changes to standards and construction manuals in order \nto incorporate the results of the demonstrations and other in-kind contributions (Appendix 2 \ncontains the cost estimates and financing plan). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MARD  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  project.  MARD  will  take  on  this \nresponsibility within the context of its mandated responsibilities in the National Target Program \nto Respond to Climate Change framework. The SRIDP central project management unit (CPMU) \nwill be the implementing agency for the TA project. The CPMU director will be responsible for \ncoordinating all field activities and institutional aspects among the government organizations, \nUNDP,  ADB,  and  the  SRIDP.  UNDP  will  provide  support  for  the  incremental  SRIDP \nmanagement costs associated with the TA project. A deputy director to the SRIDP director will \nbe responsible for managing the UNDP components and for coordinating the ADB TA.  \n \n18.  MARD has implemented a range of rural infrastructure projects since the early 1990s.13 \nAll completed projects have been assessed by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department as \nsuccessful; and ongoing projects, despite some start-up delays, are generally on track for \nsuccessful completion. The SRIDP project preparatory TA14 carried out detailed assessments \nendorsing MARD\u2019s implementation capacities. The activities of the TA will be synchronized with \nthe SRIDP to avoid implementation delays.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a 3-year period from September 2012 to August 2015. \nADB will undertake engagement of consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The estimated consulting services input is \n80 person-months (25 international person-months and 55 national person-months). ADB will \nselect (i) a consulting firm (23 international person-months and 55 national person-months) \nusing quality- and cost-based selection (90:10)15 and a full technical proposal, and (ii) individual \nconsultants (up to 2 person-months). The consulting services will consist of (i) international \nexpertise in civil engineering, bioengineering, and geotechnical engineering; technical training; \nclimate change adaptation; and social development; and (ii) national expertise in agricultural \n                                                \n13 The major ADB rural infrastructure projects include: (i) ADB. 1997.

The outline terms of reference for the consulting firm package \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  To supplement the services of the consulting firm and to allow for flexibility of inputs that \nare not yet foreseen, an allocation for 2 person-months (international) will not form part of the \ninitial consulting services package tendered through quality- and cost-based selection. ADB will \nlikely mobilize these consultants individually as needed.16 \n \n21.  Civil works for the demonstration sites will be undertaken via a subcontract funded \nthrough the consultants\u2019 contract. Equipment and materials to be financed by the TA will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). On completion of the TA project, equipment will become the property of the government \nand participating local institutions and/or communities. Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n22.  The TA will produce quarterly progress reports and five technical reports. The technical \nreports  will  include  (i)  identification  of  approaches  to  increase  rural  infrastructure  climate \nresilience, and will contain the knowledge dissemination and communication strategy and action \nplan,  and  the  susceptibility\u2013hazard\u2013risk  prioritizing  framework; 17  (ii)  demonstration  site \nconstruction; (iii) training completion report; (iv) recommendations for the integration of the \nmeasures in training curricula, standard design procedures, and contract specifications; and (v) \nassessments of climate risk and vulnerability, with potential measures for strengthening the \nresilience of communities near the demonstrations.  \n \n23.  The TA will have the initial responsibility for performance and deterioration monitoring \nand analysis of both the demonstration and control sites. Upon completion of the TA, MARD will \ncontinue the monitoring. MARD has identified the Viet Nam Academy for Water Resources\u2019 \nInstitute of Water and Environment as the preferred organization for long-term performance \nmonitoring. \n \n24.  The knowledge dissemination and communication strategy will include such activities as \nfield trips to the demonstration sites for government personnel, contractors, and interested \nprivate sector parties to view firsthand the demonstrations and their impact; and videos and \nslide shows will be produced to provide material for lectures on a range of approaches for in-\nhouse training of key government personnel as well as related engineering schools, colleges, \nand institutes. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n25.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \n \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Viet Nam to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Special Climate Change Fund of the Global Environment \nFacility for Promoting Climate Resilient Rural Infrastructure in Northern Mountain Provinces. \n                                                \n16 This project will demonstrate techniques and approaches that have not hitherto been established in Viet Nam. \nThere is not a record of previous experience to inform implementation. This introduces a level of uncertainty in \npredicting  input  to  output  relationships.  These  unallocated  consultant  inputs  will  be  utilized  to  address \nunpredictable implementation problems. \n17 UNDP will be coordinating the project outputs with the MARD provincial action plans for climate change. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  Increased use of climate  Annual performance  Assumption \n  resilient rural  reports from the  MARD will carry out \nImproved climate  infrastructure approaches  organization appointed  further pilot testing \nresilience of rural  from 0% to at least 70%  by MARD to monitor the  under different \ninfrastructure.  by December 2020.  long-term condition of  conditions. \n  the demonstration and   \n  control sites  Risks \nDeterioration rates of the  MARD fails to continue \ndemonstration sites are  monitoring the \n75% lower than those of  demonstration and \nthe control sites by  control sites after \nDecember 2020.  completion of the TA.\n \nActual climate change \nimpacts are outside the \nassumed envelope at \nTA inception.\n \nDemonstration results \nare undermined by \nfactors outside of the \nTA control, such as \nchanges in land use in \nthe area of influence of \nthe demonstrations and \ncontrols.  \nOutcome  The approaches  ADB rural infrastructure  Assumptions \n  developed\u2014including  project\u2019s report and  Demonstrations under \nEffective climate- promising modifications,  recommendation for the  the TA are successful \nresilience measures  alternatives, and lessons  President from the  and convincing.\n \nmainstreamed into the  learned\u2014will be utilized  pipeline projects \nTrained DARD technical \nMARD rural  by MARD rural  scheduled for approval \nstaff continue to be \ninfrastructure program   infrastructure investments  after 2013 \navailable for rural \n  as standard practice in \ninfrastructure projects. \n  100% of new ADB-\nfinanced projects by  Risk \nmonth 36.
