Moreover, recent economic growth has depended heavily \non the hydropower industry and its auxiliary sectors, which have \nlow employment elasticity (i.e., sensitivity of growth of employment \nwith respect to sector growth). As over 40% of the total labor force \ndepends on the agricultural sector, and as the development of the \nagricultural  sector  has  been  declining,  it  is  of  concern  to  the \nGovernment that the issues of narrow-based economic growth and \nemployment  generation  are  addressed  quickly.  Of  serious \nimmediate concern is the estimated 50,000 youths about to enter \nthe labor market and another 20,000 people migrating to the urban \nareas by the end of 2007. As the public sector is not in a position to \nabsorb  the  additional  labor  force,  even  in  the  short  term,  it  is \nimperative  that  Bhutan  diversifies  its  economic  activities  by \npromoting the development of the private sector in order to move \nto a more stable, sustainable, and broad-based economic growth \npath and to generate much-needed employment. \n ", "ii \n \nThe  private  sector  of  Bhutan  is  small,  consisting  of  significant \nnumbers  of  MSMEs,  and  faces  a  number  of  development \nconstraints.  Consequently,  the  Government  has  prioritized  the \npromotion of MSME development in the Ninth Five-Year Plan, and \nhas  also  included  the  focus  on  micro  and  small  industries, \nespecially in rural areas. In line with the Government\u2019s strategic \npriorities for national development, the MSME SDP is proposed to \nsupport the promotion of the MSME sector, address the constraints \nof MSME development, generate employment opportunities, and \nenhance overall economic growth. The MSME SDP design also \ncomplements the Government\u2019s sector development priorities, in \nwhich the private sector is expected to play a vital role as the \nengine of economic growth. The MSME SDP is fully consistent with \nthe priority focus of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \nstrategy and complements ADB\u2019s ongoing interventions to promote \ngood governance, the development of the financial sector, and \ncapacity  development  of  the  key  financial  institution  for  MSME \nfinancing.  In  addition  to  the  MSME  SDP  design  being \ncomplementary  with  ongoing  assistance  funded  by  other \ndevelopment  partners,  considerable  synergy  is  expected  as  a \nresult of program implementation.  \n     \nProgram Grant    The overall objective of the proposed MSME SDP is to promote the \nObjectives  expansion and growth of a vibrant MSME sector and encourage \nprivate sector development for broad-based sustainable economic \ngrowth and employment. To achieve this goal, the MSME SDP will \nconsist  of  a  program  grant  to  address  policy  reforms  and \nstrengthening of the enabling environment, and a project grant to \nprovide  the  required  funding  otherwise  not  available  from  the \ndomestic market due to market failure. \n \nThe  Program  objectives  include  (i)  establishing  an  integrated \npolicy,  strategy,  and  institutional  framework  for  MSME \ndevelopment;  (ii)  enhancing  business  laws  and  regulations  to \nfacilitate MSME operations; (iii) increasing access to market-based \nfinance; and (iv) strengthening business support infrastructure. \n     \nGrant Amount and    It is proposed that ADB supports the Government\u2019s policy reform \nTerms  program by providing a Program grant of $6 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  Program  grant  proceeds  are \nexpected to be utilized over a period of 36 months from the date of \ngrant effectiveness. \n     \nProgram Period    The MSME SDP will be for 3 years. The Program grant will be \nand Tranching  released in three tranches. The first tranche (not exceeding $2 \nmillion)  is  to  be  disbursed  after  grant  effectiveness  and  upon \nsatisfactory fulfillment of the first tranche conditions. The second \ntranche (not exceeding $2 million) will be disbursed 18 months \nafter  the  first  tranche,  subject  to  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the \nsecond  tranche  release  conditions.  The  third  tranche  (not \nexceeding $2 million) will be disbursed 18 months after the second \n ", "iii \ntranche,  subject  to  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding \ntranche release conditions. The policy matrix lists all the tranche \nrelease conditions and policy reform actions (Appendix 4). \n     \nExecuting and    The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the \nImplementing  MSME SDP. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will be the \nAgencies  implementing agency (IA) for the overall Program, other than for \ntwo  specific  policy  reform  actions:  (i)  the  restructuring  of  the \nBhutan  Development  Finance  Corporation  (BDFC),  for  which \nBDFC will serve as the IA; and (ii) improving quality control and \nproduct standards, for which the Standards and Quality Control \nAuthority will be the IA. To ensure appropriate coordination of the \nProgram and Project, an interagency program steering committee \nwill be set up. It will consist of, among others, representatives from \nMOF, MTI, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Royal Monetary \nAuthority, with the MTI secretary as chair.  \n     \nProcurement and    The Program grant proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of \nDisbursement  imports,  subject  to  a  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5).  All \nprocurement of goods and services produced in, and originating \nfrom, ADB member countries will be made with due consideration \nto  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard \nGovernment  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices acceptable to ADB. The disbursement of the Program \ngrant  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans (1998, as amended from time to time). The Borrower will \ncertify  that  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from \nnonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements \nmade under other official development assistance, is greater than \nthe amount expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB will \nhave the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds and to verify \nthe accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n     \nCounterpart    The Government will use the local currency funds generated by the \nFunds  Program  grant  to  meet  Program  expenditures  and  associated \nreform costs. The Government will also provide counterpart funds, \nprimarily in kind, to provide facilities for consulting services and to \nfinance taxes and duties on equipment. \n     \nProject Objectives    The Project will comprise: (i) a credit facility through BDFC for \nfinancing the medium- to long-term credit requirements of MSMEs, \nparticularly rural enterprises; (ii) a cost-sharing facility to provide \nnecessary technical and knowledge support to MSMEs that have \ngrowth potential but face specified constraints; and (iii) capacity-\nbuilding support for program implementation and institution building \nto  ensure  the  formulation  and  execution  of  sustainable  MSME \npolicy and strategies, and to ensure smooth implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s MSME development program. \n \n \n     \n ", "iv \nCost Estimate and    The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $10.60  million,  including \nFinancing Plan  contingencies  and  Government  contribution.  The  base  cost \nbreakdown by subproject is: (i) subproject 1, credit line to BDFC, \n$5.24 million; (ii) subproject 2, cost-sharing facility, $1.04 million; \nand  (iii)  subproject  3,  program  implementation  and  institutional \ncapacity building, $3.05 million, plus contingencies. A detailed cost \nestimate is in Table 2. It is proposed that ADB provides a total of \n$9  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  support  the \nProject.  \n     \nPeriod of    Until 30 June 2012  \nUtilization   \n     \nEstimated Project    31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n     \nExecuting and    MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  BDFC  will  be  the  IA  of \nImplementing  subproject 1; MTI will be the IA for subprojects 2 and 3. In view of \nAgency  the close coordination and complementary design of the Program \nand Project components, it is proposed to have one program and \nproject management unit, the MSME division, lodged under MTI, to \noversee, manage, and coordinate implementation of the MSME \nSDP  with  direct  support  from  representatives  of  concerned \nagencies (see para. 58). \n     \nProcurement and    Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  subject  to  the \nConsulting  provisions of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nServices  from time to time). Consultants will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The procurement packages for subproject 3 are \nin the procurement plan (Appendix 9). Procurement for consulting \nservices will use the quality and cost-based selection method for \nspecialized consulting services and for the purpose of costs and \nefficiency. The Government will be responsible for the procurement \nplan, and ADB will carry out review of all documents, including the \nrequest for proposal, shortlist, technical evaluation of proposals, \naward  recommendations,  and  contracts  before  issuance  by  the \nGovernment. \n     \nBenefits and    The MSME SDP is expected to contribute to an improved business \nBeneficiaries  environment  for  MSMEs,  a  financially  stronger  BDFC  with \nenhanced  institutional  capacity  and  financial  services  outreach, \nimproved  access  to  credit  for  MSMEs  through  better  use  of \nsecurity  and  credit  information;  and  increased  business \ndevelopment  services  for  enterprises  to  access  training, \ntechnology, marketing, and information. MSMEs are expected to \nbenefit from the holistic approach adopted by the MSME SDP by \nhaving an enabling policy and regulatory environment for doing \nbusiness, better access to financing, enhanced business support \ninfrastructure,  and  increased  market  access  and  product \ncompetitiveness  for  sustainable  growth.  More  than  1,400 \nenterprises are expected to gain access to finance for business \n ", "v \nexpansion, and at least 250 enterprises will receive training and \ntechnical  support  (on  a  cost-sharing  basis)  to  improve \nentrepreneurship  during  the  project  implementation  period.  It  is \nfurther expected that enhanced private sector growth and business \nexpansion by MSMEs will help absorb the increasing number of \nyoung people and new graduates entering the labor force, and will \nbroaden and diversify economic activities. The involved agencies \nand institutions are also expected to benefit from the institutional \nstrengthening and capacity development under the Project through \nthe enhancement of their operational and administrative efficiency \nand  effectiveness  for  MSME  development.  Consumers  and  the \ngeneral  population  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  protection \nafforded  by  improved  quality  and  standards  of  goods  in  the \nmarketplace,  and  foreign  tourists  will  benefit  from  enhanced \nservices.  \n     \nRisks and    There  are  three  potential  risk  situations  which  may  affect  the \nSafeguards  intended  outcomes  of  the  MSME  SDP.  The  MSME  SDP  has \nincorporated mitigating measures as appropriate to attenuate the \nimpacts associated with these risks.  \n \nThe first category of possible risk during program implementation is \nthe slowing down of policy momentum. This may occur in Bhutan \nas the country is in the process of transition into a parliamentary \ndemocracy  in  2008.  Policy  reversal  is  unlikely,  as  the  present \npolicies of the ruling monarchy are expected to continue and to \nhave wide support, as the two major parties for the 2008 elections \nstand by existing policies and further emphasize preservation of \nheritage  and  tradition  along  with  economic  development  and \nemployment  generation.  Likewise,  the  voting  population  is \ndecidedly conservative and supports state policies. In addition, a \nparliamentary  democracy  is  likely  to  enhance  the  broad-based \nownership of the reform actions rather than pose a risk to ongoing \nreforms.  The  national  development  focus  on  private  sector \ndevelopment and promotion of MSMEs, particularly in the rural \nareas, has been embedded and prioritized in all Government policy \nand strategy documents, including the Ninth Five-Year Plan (2002\u2013\n2007), Bhutan 2020 Vision, and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \n(2004).  In  addition,  the  Government  has  established  a  private \nsector  working  group  to  assist  in  the  formulation  of  the  next \nmidterm development strategy\u2014the Tenth Five-Year Plan, which \nindicates a continuing important role for MSME development in the \nnational agenda.  \n \nThe activities and policy reforms for MSME development involve a \ncross-section  of  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  and  various  ministries. \nTherefore,  close  coordination  among  relevant  government \nagencies and with the private sector, principally through the local \nchamber  of  commerce  and  industry  and  various  industry \nassociations,  to  support  and  oversee  program  and  project \nimplementation is necessary. The lack of, or weakness of, such \n ", "vi \ncoordination poses the second possible area of risk to the success \nof the MSME SDP. To mitigate such risk, the MSME SDP will \nensure smooth implementation through an adequate institutional \nmechanism at two levels: a program steering committee at the \ninterministerial  level,  and  a  dedicated  MSME  division  at  the \nimplementation level with private sector representation. To ensure \na participatory consultation process and public-private partnership \nunder  the  MSME  SDP,  proper  private  sector  representation  is \nassured through the active participation of the Bhutan Chamber of \nCommerce  and  Industry  in  the  MSME  division,  in  order  to \ncontribute to the reform process and provide feedback on program \nand  project  implementation.  In  addition,  an  enhanced  Private \nSector Development Committee (formed in 2002) with increased \nprivate sector representation or such a body as may be designed \nfor the same purpose after the ongoing ministerial organizational \ndevelopment  process  designed  to  improve  the  efficiency  of \nGovernment  offices,  agencies,  and  state-owned  enterprises  is \ncompleted, will, with the support of the MSME division, serve in an \nadvisory capacity to help in the formulation of policy for MSME \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe third possible risk area is that of limited institutional capacity \nfor proper implementation of the Program and Project components, \nparticularly the implementation of the credit line at BDFC and the \ncost-sharing facility at MTI. The risks associated with this capacity \nconstraint will be addressed by allocating adequate resources to \nprovide  technical  support  to  involved  agencies.  The  technical \nsupport  to  BDFC  will  be  provided  by  the  ongoing  technical \nassistance  which  will  prepare  the  5-year  business  plan  and \nstrategy, and subsequently assist in implementing the business \nplan  and  skills  training  for  better  MSME  lending  and  effective \ncredit-line assistance. Parallel reforms under the ongoing Financial \nSector Development Program will address corporate governance \nissues  and  adherence  to  prudential  standards  of  operation. \nSubproject 3 will provide capacity building to the MSME division to \nsupport the implementation, management, and disbursement of the \ncost-sharing facility. Other relevant capacity-development supports \nto involved agencies, such as the Standards and Quality Control \nAuthority, are also incorporated into subproject 3 to ensure smooth \nprogram implementation.  \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nMicro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector Development Program (MSME SDP) for the \nKingdom of Bhutan, consisting of (i) a program grant to support policy reforms; and (ii) a project \ngrant  to  extend  credit  to  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs),  support \nbusiness development, and facilitate program implementation.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n2.  Background. Bhutan is in the eastern Himalaya and is landlocked between the world\u2019s \ntwo most populous nations\u2014the People\u2019s Republic of China and India. It has one of the most \nformidable mountainous terrains in the world, ranging from 200 meters (m) to 7,500 m in \naltitude. The total land area is 38,394 square kilometers, 72% of which is covered by forest. \nLand use is correlated with altitude and climate. Bhutan is administratively divided into 20 \ndzongkhags (districts), which are further broken down into 201 gewogs (blocks). According to \nthe Population and Housing Census 2005, the total population of Bhutan is about 634,982, \naround 70% of whom live in rural areas.  \n \n3.  Macroeconomic Performance. Bhutan has experienced strong economic performance \nwith steady gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging around 7% per annum since the \n1980s. However, despite strong economic growth, poverty in Bhutan still remains a social and \neconomic issue, as an estimated 32% of the population still live below the poverty line.1 The \nhigh growth has increased GDP per capita to almost $1,3002 in 2005,3 from $834 in 2004, \nmainly driven by the growth in the hydropower and auxiliary sectors. The commissioning of the \n1,020  megawatt  Tala  project  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  economy  in  terms  of \ngenerating revenues from electricity exports, especially when the project reaches full capacity \nafter the monsoon season starts in May\u2013June 2007. GDP growth is forecast4 to be about 9% in \n2006 and 18% in 2007 in nominal terms (see Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n4.  Overall Sector Structure and Performance. Sector performance has been strong in \nthe hydropower and its related industries. The electricity sales were 10% of overall nominal \nGDP in 2005. The share of the manufacturing and construction sectors (including hydropower-\nrelated construction) is also significant, accounting for 26% in 2004 and 24.3% in 2005. The \nGDP share of the trade sector5 averaged only about 5.5% during 2004\u20132005. The services \nsector6 increased, primarily due to the growth in the tourism industry and, more recently, the \nfinancial sector.7 It accounted for 22.9% of GDP in 2004 and 27.4% in 2005. The share of the \n                                                 \n1 Royal Government of Bhutan. 2004. Poverty Analysis Report Bhutan. Thimphu: National Statistical Bureau. \n2  According to the Population and Housing Census 2005, the Government made a downward adjustment in the \npopulation figure, decreasing it from 750,000 in 2004 to 634,982 in 2005. As a result, there was a significant \nincrease in GDP per capita in 2005.  \n3  Bhutan\u2019s fiscal year ends on 30 June. The growth data available, which is based on a calendar year, is up to 2005. \n4  Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates. ADB. 2007. ADB Outlook. Manila. \n5  This includes wholesale and retail trade. \n6  This  includes  hotels  and  restaurants,  financing,  insurance,  real  estate,  business  services,  transport  and \ncommunication, and social and private services. \n7  Significant growth in the financial sector in 2005 was mainly due to increased returns from the financial sector\u2019s \nforeign investments, arising mainly from deposits of the hydropower sector, as indicated by the high growth in \ninterest income of the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA).  \n ", "2 \ntourism sector was 8.7% of GDP in 2005. Finally, the agriculture sector (including mining) \naccounted for 23.8% of GDP in 2005, decreasing from 24.7% in 2004. Despite the decrease in \nagriculture as a percentage of GDP, the contribution of agriculture in terms of employment still \nremains  significant,  at  44.7%  of  the  total  labor  force,  particularly  as  the  economy  is  still \npredominantly dependent on subsistence farming. By way of contrast, the contribution of the \nindustry sector to the total labor force is only 16.1%, and the contribution of the services sector \n8.4%.  \n \n5.  Need to Promote Private Sector Development. Bhutan\u2019s economy is dependent upon \na narrow base for economic growth. High dependence on the hydropower sector and low \nproductivity in the agriculture sector thus raise serious concerns about the long-term prospects \nfor economic development and employment in the country. As the hydropower sector has low \nemployment elasticity (i.e. sensitivity of growth of employment with respect to sector growth), it \nis essential for the country to diversify economic activity to generate employment, raise income \nlevels for the poor, and achieve stable, sustainable, and broad-based economic growth. In this \nregard, the Government of Bhutan (the Government) has placed a high priority on private sector \ndevelopment, particularly in view of the need to absorb an estimated 50,000 young people \nentering the labor market and another 20,000 people migrating to urban areas by the end of \n2007.  \n \n6.  Significance  and  Definition  of  the  MSME  Sector.  The  private  sector  in  Bhutan \ncomprises micro, small, medium, and large enterprises. The official classification is based on \ninitial capital investment which, by definition, consists of paid-in capital and long-term credit. \nEach business is registered under one of the above-mentioned categories and has a business \nlicense that needs to be renewed annually. Following the industrial classification method,8 \nmanufacturing and services micro enterprises are businesses with investment of less than Nu1 \nmillion, small enterprises have investment of between Nu1 million and Nu10 million, medium \nenterprises have investment of between Nu10 million and Nu100 million, and large enterprises \nhave investment of more than Nu100 million. Approximately 93% of the newly established \nbusinesses over the past 5 years are MSMEs. In 2006, the estimated number of MSMEs in \nBhutan  was  16,557  (13,677  micro,  2,658  small,  and  222  medium-sized  enterprises)  (see \nAppendix  1).  The  significant  number  of  MSMEs,  especially  micro  and  small  enterprises, \nindicates the predominant role of MSMEs in private sector development.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n7.  The Government is aware of the significance of the MSME sector and has therefore \ntargeted it (especially rural-based businesses) in its private sector development efforts, with the \naim of enhancing overall economic growth. However, despite Government efforts, including \ncommitment to private sector development in the country\u2019s 5-year development plans since the \nlate 1980s, the MSME sector remains weak (typically one-person shop operations) and thus is \nyet to generate employment opportunities or serve as the engine of growth as envisaged. \nMSME development continues to face the following challenges.9 \n                                                 \n8  In the trade sector, micro enterprises are businesses with investments of less than Nu1 million, small enterprises \nhave investment of between Nu1 and Nu5 million, medium enterprises have investment of between Nu5 and Nu10 \nmillion, and large enterprises have investment of more than Nu10 million. \n9  ADB. 2004.

Lack  of  Suitable  Development  Policy  and  Supporting  Institutional \nFramework  \n \n8.  Absence of a Clear Vision, Integrated Policy, and Long-Term Strategy for MSME \nDevelopment. The development of the MSME sector in Bhutan is characterized by significant \nfragmentation of decision making, the lack of strategic guidance, and weak coordination among \nrelevant ministries and agencies. Currently, Government assistance for sector development is \nformulated  and  implemented  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  without  systematic  assessment  and/or \ncomprehensive studies on the forward linkage and supply chain of the targeted product or \nindustry.  For  example,  tourism,  agro-processing,  wood,  and  wood-based  industries  are \nidentified as growth areas for private sector development in Bhutan. However, there is yet to be \nany consistent or coherent sector or product development strategy at an industry or sector level \nto improve the market competitiveness of these industries. Nor does the Government have a \ncoordination mechanism or framework across ministries and government agencies to collect \nfeedback, reach consensus, and guide the target sector and/or industry to develop the value \nchains or clusters for sustainable business development. Despite ongoing external assistance \nfrom other development partners (see Section E: External Assistance to the Sector for more \ndetail), there is a great need for the Government to develop a clear and comprehensive country \ndevelopment policy and strategy for effectively addressing the challenges and constraints faced \nby the MSME sector.  \n \n9.  Weak  Institutional  Structure  for  Development  Coordination.  While  there  is \ncoordination  between  public  and  private  sectors  that  allows  for  input  from  private  sector \nrepresentatives, public-private interaction remains inadequate for the stimulation of business \ndevelopment. In 2000, the Government established a private sector development committee \n(PSDC) to initiate and coordinate supportive policies and programs. However, the structure of \nthe PSDC has proved to be too large and it lacked sufficient authority to perform its tasks \neffectively, which has resulted in a defunct entity.10 In 2005, the PSDC was revived with a \nslimmer structure and also with increased private sector participation.11 However, to put the \nguiding  policy,  development  strategy,  and  regulation  for  private  sector  development  into \npractice, there is an apparent need to further strengthen the current institutional structure for \nmore efficient decision making, administration, and coordination. \n \n2.  Lack of an Enabling Environment for Business to Operate \n \n10.  Inadequate Business Laws and Regulations. Bhutanese laws are often drafted or \nenacted lacking operational details. The costs and benefits of regulation are not expressly \nconsidered during drafting. For example, the Bankruptcy Act (1999) has an essential feature of \nclosing down companies in the event of bankruptcy and allowing creditors to file claims on the \nassets of the concerned corporation. However, there is no regulation or detailed procedures \nclearly spelled out for subsequent court proceedings. In addition, due to a lack of awareness \nand familiarity with the law among businesses, the Bankruptcy Act is currently neither used nor \nimplemented. Another example is the Cooperative Act (2001), in which there is no central \n                                                 \n10 The PSDC was originally established with 26 members, including ministers and representatives of all ministries \nand relevant government agencies, and few private sector representatives. \n11 The  revised  PSDC  has  a  reduced  member  structure,  down  from  26  to  12  members.  Members  include \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Information and Communications, \nMinistry of Labor and Human Resource, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, \nthe Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industries, and the private sector, including the wood-based, general \nmanufacturing, and cement manufacturing sectors. \n ", "4 \nregistration office for cooperatives, despite the existence of a legal provision for one. As a result \nof lack of operational guidelines, organized cooperatives still face a financing constraint. This is \nbecause financial institutions hesitate to lend without proper registration and recognized legal \nstatus  for  cooperatives.  There  is  therefore  a  need  to  establish  an  appropriate  framework \nallowing  stakeholders  to  participate  in  discussions,  express  their  views,  and  spell  out \noperational  details  in  the  making  of  laws  and  regulations  to  encourage  better  regulatory \npractice. \n \n11.  Cumbersome  Business  Formalization  Process.  There  is  a  complex  and  time \nconsuming business formalization process in Bhutan. A multitude of business and sectoral \nlicenses  are  required,  and  these  are  often  duplicative  and  burdensome.  Compliance \nrequirements, such as supporting documents and clearances, are overlapping and numerous. \nThe World Bank\u2019s Doing Business reports was recently updated, and on the indicators of \nstarting a business, it ranks Bhutan 79 out of 175 countries.12 Starting a business previously \ninvolved 11 procedures, and this has been reduced to 10, takes 62 days, and costs 16.6% of \nper  capita  income.13  In  2005,  MTI  initiated  several  measures  to  reduce  the  business \nformalization  process  and  it  currently  takes  43  days  to  receive  licenses  for  starting  up  a \nbusiness; international good practice suggests 21 days.  \n \n  3.  Limited Access to Finance \n \n12.  Market Failure in MSME Financing, particularly in Rural Areas. As is the case with \nother developing countries, especially in the early growth stage, limited access to finance is \nidentified as a continuing fundamental constraint for doing business. It is even more so in \nBhutan, particularly for micro and small businesses and those in rural areas.14 The constraint is \nattributable  mainly  to  a  segmented  lending  market  caused  by  extremely  high  collateral \nrequirements and low banking intermediation. The two commercial banks, the Bank of Bhutan \n(BOB) and the Bhutan National Bank (BNB), operate at the low-risk end of the market, mainly in \nurban areas, and require considerable collateral (up to 200% of the liability), while the Bhutan \nDevelopment Finance Corporation (BDFC) lends to MSMEs, both in urban and rural areas and \napparently has poor liquidity and limited sources of funds.15 In addition, due to a lack of suitable \ncollateral, reliable credit information, and thus an inability to appropriately assess risk, most of \nthe credit has been channeled to large to medium-sized enterprises which can meet high \ncollateral requirements, leaving the majority of MSMEs with insufficient financing and limited \naccess to credit. Local sources of medium- to long-term finance remain scarce as the domestic \ncapital market is still in its formative stages. \n \n13.  Insufficient Institutional Capacity among Financial Institutions. Limited access to \ncredit by MSMEs is also largely attributed to institutional deficiencies within the existing financial \ninstitutions,  such  as  (i)  corporate  governance,  (ii)  strategic  business  planning,  (iii)  risk \nmanagement, (iv) product development, (v) human-resources development, and (vi) information \ntechnology (IT). BOB and BNB, which mainly lend to large and medium-sized enterprises, have \nsigned  memoranda  of  understanding  with  the  SouthAsia  Enterprise  Development  Facility \n                                                 \n12 The country ranking of Bhutan in ease of doing business is 138, dealing with licenses 145, employment of workers \n116 (mainly due to difficulty of hiring as a result of lack of skilled labors), and getting credit 159.  \n13 World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2006.

Gender Diagnostic Study Bhutan. Manila. \n15 BDFC is a nondepository financial institution and its equity is mostly sourced from grants, reserves, and retained \nearnings. As of the end of 2006, BDFC\u2019s liquidity is above the liquidity requirement (10%) by a small margin. \n ", "5 \n(SEDF) for capacity building to develop and strengthen their general banking and SME lending \noperations. To enable BDFC to fully exploit its potential and effectively intermediate financing, \nthere is a need to strengthen BDFC\u2019s role and capacity for MSME lending.16 The introduction of \n(i) stronger corporate governance, (ii) corporate and strategic planning, (iii) specific MSME \nlending  and  nonperforming  loans  recovery  techniques,  and  (iv)  development  of  innovative \nfinancial  services,  are  a  prerequisite,  particularly  for  BDFC,  to  successfully  serve  MSMEs \nefficiently in urban and rural areas. \n \n14.  Shortage of Long-Term Funding at BDFC. BDFC has unrivalled outreach in rural \nareas and is mandated to focus on micro enterprise and rural lending. As of the end of 2005, \nBDFC had 14,764 active clients in rural areas, or 17.2% of total rural households. BDFC has \n44% of the total clients17 in the financial market, and as of the end of 2006 it had over 90% of \nrural lending in Bhutan. Because of its social mandate, existing nationwide branch network, and \nbetter MSME lending skills in comparison with the other two banks, BDFC is seen as the most \nappropriate agency to help overcome the financial constraints of the MSME sector, particularly \nin rural areas. However, as a nonbank financial institution, BDFC does not have direct access to \nthe domestic savings market except the recent rural saving program which the Royal Monetary \nAuthority (RMA) has issued licenses for. The sources of funds are therefore mainly external \nloans and grants from international agencies, such as ADB, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \nDevelopment, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. In the past, BDFC was \nable to occasionally raise medium-term funds locally from National Pension and Provident Fund, \nBNB, and BOB, using some of the excess liquidity of the financial sector then in Bhutan.  \n \n15.  Lack of Credit Information on MSMEs. Another impediment to sustained growth of the \nprivate sector in Bhutan is the lack of credit information and the mechanism to collect such \ninformation in order for lenders to be able to identify profitable projects in a risky environment. \nConsequently, the provision of financial services is restricted to low-risk clients or is based on \nexcessive collateral requirements instead of on a credit analysis relying on repayment capability \nbased on financial performance and statements and business plans. Therefore, a more flexible \nand dynamic credit information system will improve the accuracy and cost effectiveness of credit \nrisk decisions made by financial institutions (e.g., by cutting down on credit appraisal time and \ndecreasing reliance  on  collateral).  This, in  turn,  will  result  in improved  access  to  financial \nservices,  in  particular,  for  small  businesses  and  individual  borrowers.  Because  of  the \nimportance and urgency of this issue, ADB has provided support to the establishment of a credit \ninformation bureau under the Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP) in 2006.18 \n \n16.  Limited Secured Financing. The credit information supporting system is also weak with \nregard to the collateralization of transactions. In general, at the lower end of the rural finance \nmarket, social pressure is used to secure micro loans. In the middle segment, comprising small \nfarmers and MSMEs, access to affordable medium- to long-term credit is constrained by little \nproperty or imperfect title to small parcels of land. However, MSMEs usually have significant \nmovable assets (e.g., equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable). Enabling borrowers to \nuse these movable assets and rights to secure their indebtedness opens up new possibilities for \nMSMEs to access finance and make fuller economic use of their assets. However, in Bhutan \nthere is limited secured financing to ease high collateral requirements. \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Preparing the SME/Microenterprise Development \nProgram: Financing Component. Manila (TA 4837-BHU approved on 11 September). \n17 However, due to low average loan size, BDFC has only 12% of total principal outstanding. \n18 ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grant for the Financial Sector Development Program. Manila (Loan 2279-BHU approved on \n7 December). \n ", "6 \n \n17.  The main reason for limited secured financing is that the existing system of registration \nof mortgages and charges is fragmented. There is no central registry to allow for the verification \nof interests, especially movable property such as working equipment used as collateral. Lacking \naccess to a proper central registry, the borrower must first obtain a clearance from every \nfinancial  institution  to  certify  that  there  is  no  preexisting  claim.  This  cumbersome  process \ncauses delays in loan processing and involves high costs for the financial institutions and the \nclients. Bhutanese regulations regarding secured transactions are set out in the Loan Act \n(1981), the Companies Act (2000), and the Movable and Immovable Property Act (1999), the \nprovisions of which call for the registration of mortgages and charges. Even though there are \ntwo land registrars at the central and local level, they only maintain records on ownership and \nnot  on  collateralization  of  land  and  buildings.  The  Thimphu  City  Corporation  has  recently \napproached  the  financial  institutions  and  requested  them  to  forward  to  the  Thimphu  City \nCorporation the mortgage details of all the properties within the Thimphu Urban Municipality in \norder to build up an information base on the status of all mortgages. However, so far there has \nbeen  no  response  from  the  financial  institutions.  Under  the  Road  Safety  and  Transport \nAuthority, a registry exists where charges on cars have been registered. Under the Ministry of \nTrade  and  Industry  (MTI),  a  registry  of  charges  was  set  up;  however,  it  only  applies  to \nincorporated companies. As a result, the fragmented and nontransparent system of registration \nof collateralized mortgages and charges in Bhutan needs to be further improved to better record \nand  monitor  mortgages  and  charges,  and  thereby  secure  \u201clender\u2013borrower/creditor-debtor\u201d \ntransactions to effectively facilitate access to credit.  \n \n18.  Ineffective Government Credit and Credit Guarantee Assistance Schemes. In 1987, \nthe  Government  launched  a  credit  scheme  for  small  enterprises  (small  businesses  and \nartisans). This scheme was a failure as about 96% of loans defaulted, and was consequently \ndiscontinued in the mid-1990\u2019s. The main problem was that the client\u2019s perception was of having \nreceived a grant rather than a loan from the Government. In 1992, the Government launched \nthe Entrepreneurs Development Program Loan Scheme (EDPLS), for Nu100 million, intended \nfor individuals who had successfully completed the Comprehensive Entrepreneurship Course. \nThe  absence  of  personal  risk  was  felt  to  have  eroded  the  commitment  to  repay,  thus \nnonperforming loans were high. Consequently, financial institutions became risk-averse and \nwere reluctant to approve further loans to MSMEs. Until early 2005, only 48 entrepreneurs (less \nthan 20% of the 258 Comprehensive Entrepreneurship Course graduates) had received a loan, \nout of which only 25 are currently running their businesses successfully. The loan scheme was \nsubsequently adjusted; equity contribution and some collateral are now required.  \n \n19.  In 2003, to further support self-employment, the Government complemented the EDPLS \nwith a credit guarantee scheme (CGS) through the two commercial banks. The Small Business \nResources Center under the Bhutan Export Promotion Center acts on behalf of the Government \nto  (i)  appraise  proposals  for  eligible  applicants,  (ii)  provide  support,  and  (iii)  maintain  the \nguarantee  fund.  Neither  equity  contribution  nor  collateral  is  required,  and  the  Government \ncovers  60%  of  the  credit  risk  to  the  financial  institutions.  Due  to  the  relatively  short \nimplementation time of the CGS its effectiveness cannot yet be determined. \n \n  4.  Inadequate Business Support Infrastructure \n \n20.  Lack of Market Information and Technical Expertise. Key impediments to private \nsector growth in Bhutan are the lack of available information and mechanisms to collect market \ninformation, and limited technical expertise. Most of the MSMEs in Bhutan are still in their \ninfancy, selling their products locally or, at best, nationwide, and have yet to be exposed to \ninternational markets and competition. In addition, it is particularly difficult for MSMEs in rural \n ", "7 \nareas to gather relevant business information on things such as prices, products, technologies, \nand markets, and to employ external services to improve business performance. With Bhutan \nbecoming a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the near future, competition for \nbusinesses  is  very  likely  to  increase  and  this  poses  an  urgent  need  for  increasing \ncompetitiveness of MSMEs via promotion and enhancement of business development services \n(BDS) in Bhutan.  \n \n21.  BDS refers to consulting support for training, and access to technology, marketing, \ninformation, and markets. Traditionally, the government delivers BDS via public providers or \ngovernment-subsidized  programs,  and  this  tends  to  be  supply-driven.  However,  these \ninterventions have had the tendency to (i) impinge upon existing or potential commercially \noriented service providers, (ii) have questionable long-term sustainability, and (iii) have difficulty \nin developing a discerning client culture among MSMEs.19 According to the findings of the \nMSME market survey,20 the Government dominates the provision of MSME BDS, providing \ntraining such as bookkeeping, management, and accounting. Nonetheless, commercial BDS \nalso exists, overlapping in the areas of fully subsidized BDS in addition to providing demand-led \nservices.21 The coexistence of public and private BDS indicates a potential opportunity for the \nGovernment to fully develop the private sector BDS market, especially in view of its current \nlimited  outreach  due  to  the  small  number  of  MSMEs  that  can  be  served  through  limited \ngovernment subsidies. Focusing on the promotion of BDS markets is not only a sustainable way \nfor improving BDS but also an effective approach, as proven by practical experience. Bhutan\u2019s \nMSME market survey also reveals that there are only either commercial fully paid or fully \nsubsidized BDS available and no partially financed or cofinanced BDS arrangements, which \nindicates another opportunity, as a transition mechanism to promote fully market-based BDS \nand increase the outreach and sustainability of BDS programs.  \n \n22.  Incomplete  Legal  and  Organizational  Frameworks  for  Standards  and  Quality \nControl.  To  ensure  the  quality  of  enterprises\u2019  products  and  services  in  order  to  increase \ncompetitiveness and market access, it is very important to establish national standards and for \nrelevant international standards to be adopted and implemented in manufacturing goods and \nservices, and to reduce technical barriers to trade. However, the development of standards, \nmetrology,22 and conformity assessment in Bhutan are at a very rudimentary stage; currently, \nthe legal framework for standards and quality is incomplete. The draft Standards Act, which has \nbeen  approved  by  the  Government,  is  to  be  submitted  to,  and  enacted  by,  the  National \nAssembly. The setting of standards and other regulatory tasks are fragmented among various \nGovernment agencies.23 In addition, apparently no coordination body or authority in place that \nwould  safeguard  (i)  harmonious  development  of  standards,  regulations,  and  conformity \nassessment procedures; and (ii) the preparation, adoption, and application of standards and \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2006. Best Practice Notes on Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises Support. Manila. \n20 Under an ADB TA (footnote 9), a market survey was conducted to collect business information, particularly from \nthe micro and small enterprises, including those in central and eastern Bhutan, for a systematic evaluation of \nbusiness  development  requirements  and  bottlenecks.  The  38  sampled  enterprises  are  well  balanced  in \nrepresenting the sectors, including the manufacturing and services sectors, but excluding the trade sector as it \nmainly consists of micro and ad hoc trade operations.  \n21 These BDS are mainly in the fields of accounting, bookkeeping, and management, and to a lesser extent, \nproduction and technical training, study tours and trade fairs, and quality certification (ISO 9000).  \n22 Metrology refers to physical measurement standards. \n23 The following regulators already exist. BAFRA is the regulator in the agricultural sector; the Drug Regulatory \nAuthority in the health sector; the Department of Information Technology in the IT sector (under the Ministry of \nCommunication); and the SQCA, under the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, in the construction sector. \nOverall  environmental  standards  and  regulations  are  set  and  controlled  by  the  National  Environmental \nCommission. \n ", "8 \nregulations as foreseen by WTO\u2019s Technical Barrier to Trade agreement. Although according to \nthe recently drafted Standards Act, the Standards and Quality Control Authority (SQCA) will \ntake over the functions of a national standards body, it has yet to have a clear organizational \nstructure and lacks a human-resources development plan to fulfill its new mandate.  \n \n23.  Priority for standards setting has been identified in the food and agricultural products \nsectors due to their strong links with the growing tourism sector. The development of food \nquality  and  standards  represents  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  MSMEs  to  meet  WTO \nrequirements and increase their access to international markets. In this context, the Bhutan \nAgricultural  and  Food  Regulatory  Authority  (BAFRA),  established  in  August  2000  and \nfunctioning as a food inspector, plays an important role for the development of standards for \nagricultural-based products. BAFRA24 has a strong presence all over Bhutan and operates three \nlaboratories to regulate the quality of products that are either locally produced or imported for \nfurther  processing  for  export  or  the  domestic  market.  However,  BAFRA  is  currently \nunderstaffed,  and  its  existing  staff,  both  in  the  field  and  laboratory,  lack  the  experience, \ninternational exposure, and qualifications to undertake food quality and standards setting. The \nexisting laboratory equipment also needs to be upgraded to meet modern standards.   \n \nC.  Government Strategy \n \n24.  The Government\u2019s Ninth Five-Year Plan 2002\u2013200725 was prepared in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term strategy framework (Bhutan 2020 Vision) and the National Poverty \nReduction Strategy 2004, both of which clearly reflect the priority of private sector growth for \nemployment generation. Recognizing that hydropower development will continue to play a vital \nrole in economic growth, diversifying the economic activity to boost employment is central to the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. This is to be accomplished by, among other things, \nimproving  the  private  sector  enabling  environment,  boosting  the  efficiency  of  the  financial \nsector, and steadily enhancing institutional capacity and human resources. In addition, the \nGovernment places emphasis on micro and small industries, especially those which are rural-\nbased, to provide more off-farm employment opportunities to alleviate the poverty that is seen \nmore  in  rural  than  urban  areas.  The  development  strategy  emphasizes  skills  training  for \nbusiness development and marketing, as well as loans to rural enterprises, which will continue \nto be provided by BDFC.  \n \nD.  ADB Strategy and Lessons Learned \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2006\u2013201026 is aligned with the Government\u2019s \nninth 5-year plan to promote private sector development for broad-based economic growth. Built \nupon the recommendations of the country assistance program evaluation 2005,27 ADB\u2019s current \nprogrammed assistance focuses on, among other things, fostering a more competitive financial \nsector, developing micro enterprises, and developing the private sector. Consequently, the \nFSDP was provided to strengthen the governance of the financial system as a whole and \nencourage improvement of financial efficiency with institutional strengthening measures that will \nbenefit the private sector. ADB programmed the proposed MSME SDP to follow on from the \ninitiatives of the FSDP for further private sector promotion. Drawing on the recommendations of \nthe country assistance program evaluation 2005 and the program completion report of the \n                                                 \n24 BAFRA\u2019s human resources comprise 100 technical field staff, 23 laboratory staff, 16 management, and support \nstaff. \n25 The Ninth Five-Year Plan has been extended by 1 year to cover the period of 2002\u20132008. \n26 ADB. 2005.

The MSME SDP design also closely follows the suggestions of ADB\u2019s Best Practice \nNotes  (footnote  19)  for  SME  development  in  order  to  (i)  create  an  enabling  environment, \nespecially the policy and regulatory framework to reduce barriers to enterprises; (ii) ensure an \nappropriate internal Government coordination body and mechanisms for successful SME policy \nformulation and implementation existed; (iii) address the issue of limited access to affordable \nfunding for MSMEs by combining the regulatory reforms and capacity development of target \nfinancial institutions with the provision of credits; and (iv) improve BDS for MSMEs by not only \nthe provision of technical know-how but also the promotion of private-sector oriented BDS \nmarkets providing a range of demand-driven business support services.  \n \n27.  There are ongoing ADB assistance projects and reforms complementary to the MSME \nSDP design. The ADB FSDP approved in 2006 focused on enhancing corporate governance \nand the regulatory framework of the financial sector, aiming to improve the confidence of private \ninvestors and the provision of better financial services. There is another ongoing technical \nassistance (TA 4837) (footnote 16) for preparing a new 5-year business plan and strategy for \nBDFC which will enable BDFC to focus and enhance MSME financing and further improve the \nefficiency and effectiveness of current MSME lending practices. In addition, in view of the \nimproved road transport network and accessibility in rural areas and between the west and east \nsupported by ADB\u2019s road improvement project,29 it is envisaged that the focus of the MSME \nSDP on micro and small enterprises, including rural ones, will increase the livelihood of rural \nhouseholds and increase local business opportunities, including in the eastern part of the \ncountry.  \n \nE.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n28.  There  are  several  ongoing  donor  activities  which  directly  or  indirectly  relate  to  the \ncreation of an improved environment for business development. ADB under the MSME SDP will \nensure close coordination for a complementary program design to the existing support provided \nby other development partners (Appendix 2). \n \n29.

The United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2006 co-funded the Rural Enterprise Development \nProgram with the Netherlands Development Organization (SNV) to provide capacity building for \nBDS at the regional and district levels (i.e., at the six regional trade and industrial offices \n[RTIOs])  as  well  as  to  rural  enterprises  at  the  grassroots  level.  The  Rural  Enterprise \nDevelopment Program totals \u20ac1.5 million (approximately $2 million). UNDP is currently providing \ntechnical assistance in developing cooperatives in selective industries. SNV\u2019s Market Access for \nthe Poor Program provided a long-term advisor from 2002 to 2006 to enhance the credit and \nsavings facility in rural areas, which was intended to complement the Second Eastern Zone \nAgricultural Programme, cofunded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, SNV, \nand  the  United  Nations  Capital  Development  Fund,  to  strengthen  the  livelihood  of  rural \nhouseholds.  \n \n30.  In 2006, the World Bank provided $15 million of the First Development Policy Grant \n(DPG  I)  to  Bhutan.  One  of  the  four  components  under  DPG  I  aimed  to:  (i)  improve  the \nfunctioning of labor markets through the development of flexible labor and employment laws \n(i.e., the enactment of the Labor Act), (ii) create an enabling environment for foreign direct \ninvestment (review of the Foreign Direct Investment Rules), and (iii) reduce the cost of doing \nbusiness by simplifying the business registration process (from 62 days to 47 days). In 2007, \nthe World Bank provided the Second DPG (DPG II) of $12 million to help the Government \ncontinue the reform agenda of DPG I, as the availability of resources in the short term is not \nincreasing as much as previously anticipated due to the delay in the commissioning of the Tala \nhydropower project. The World Bank also approved the Private Sector Development Project, \ntotaling $8 million, to promote enterprise development in the information technology (IT) sector. \nIt will provide IT skills training and improve access to finance (through improvement of IT \ninfrastructure at BOB and the establishment of an interbank electronic funds transfer system). In \nview  of  ADB\u2019s  long  history  of,  and  ongoing  assistance  in,  supporting  financial  sector \ndevelopment in Bhutan, the World Bank has closely consulted with ADB in designing projects, \nand  it  has  been  agreed  that  communication  and  coordination  will  continue  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n31.  There  is  other  development  assistance  complementing  the  proposed  MSME  SDP \ndesign. The SEDF of the International Finance Corporation provided support to promote SMEs \nwith legal and regulatory review (i.e., the Company Act) and established a knowledge center \nand SME toolkit program at the Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI). In addition, \nthe  SEDF  provided  basic  technical  training  in  credit  appraisal,  reconstruction  of  financial \nstatements, and introduction of credit scoring for SMEs to various financial institutions. Starting \nfrom 2006, the SEDF will further support BOB, BNB, and the Royal Insurance Corporation of \nBhutan in business planning, strengthening of general banking and SME lending operations, \nand development of new financial services and products suitable to SMEs.  \n \n32.  Other development partners provided sector-specific and trade-related assistance to \nenhance  market  competitiveness  of  Bhutanese  products.  The  Government  of  Austria  is \nproviding technical support in enhancing the capacity of the Hotels and Tourism Management \nTraining Institute to promote tourism in Bhutan. The European Commission is helping the \nGovernment review and formulate international trade policies and is providing relevant capacity \nbuilding to prepare for WTO accession. The European Commission also provides support for \nproduct development and market analysis to the handicraft and wood-based industries and the \nBhutan Export Promotion Center. In addition, the European Commission has provided technical \nsupport to enhance all agricultural subsectors (including livestock) in order to increase cash-\n ", "11 \ncrop  income  through  proper  pest  management,  disease  control,  and  environmental \nconservation.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n33.  The overall objective of the proposed MSME SDP is to promote a vibrant MSME sector \nand encourage private sector development for sustainable economic growth. To achieve this \ngoal and the envisaged impact, the MSME SDP consists of a Program grant and a Project \ngrant. The Program grant will address the needed policy reforms to develop a policy framework, \na long-term vision and strategy, and a sector development program, designed to create an \nenabling environment for MSMEs. The Project grant, which consists of three subprojects, is \ndesigned to (i) improve access to, and increase, affordable credit for MSMEs, particularly in \nrural  areas;  (ii)  fill  viability  gaps  and  improve  the  provision  of  BDS  to  increase  market \ncompetitiveness of MSMEs; and (iii) provide support for program implementation and capacity \nbuilding as required to implement specific MSME SDP components. The expected outcome of \nthe MSME SDP is a more conducive business environment for more active private sector \nparticipation (particularly MSMEs), contributing to broad-based economic development.  \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n34.  There are three important features in the MSME SDP design. Firstly, the Program \nprioritizes the policy, regulatory, and institutional reform agenda, complementing the Project \ndesign of investment and technical support, for an integrated and holistic approach to develop \nthe private sector. The Program\u2019s policy and regulatory reform emphasizes the creation of a \nconducive business environment, which has been proven to generate larger impacts on micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises than large ones. In addition, the Program\u2019s institutional \nreform  addresses  the  urgent  need  to  establish  an  MSME  coordination  unit  to  formulate, \ncoordinate, implement, and monitor a long-term MSME policy and strategy, which is also crucial \nfor pursuing MSME development.  \n \n35.  Secondly, the MSME SDP provides an inclusive growth strategy to not only increase \neconomic growth opportunities but also focus on ensuring the participation of micro and small \nenterprises in the growth process. The Program and Project design incorporate necessary \nmeasures, including credits to MSMEs and capacity development, as identified by the country \nassistance program evaluation 2005 and the country strategy and program 2006\u20132010, to \naddress the key constraints facing the private sector in Bhutan.  \n \n36.  Thirdly, the MSME SDP design complements the ongoing ADB FSDP and TA 4837 \n(footnote 16) to improve access to finance and bring the rural sector into the formal financial \nsystem. The proposed credit line (subproject 1 under the Project grant) will be implemented \nalong  with  the  implementation  of  the  ongoing  TA  4837  which  will  prepare  and,  equally \nimportantly,  implement  a  new  5-year  business  plan  and  strategy  for  BDFC  to  focus  and \nenhance  MSME  financing.  In  addition,  the  promotion  of  secured  transactions  through  the \nestablishment of a central registry (subproject 3 of the Project grant) will complement the \nestablishment of a credit information bureau under the FSDP so as to make reliable credit \ninformation  available  and  reduce  transaction  costs  for  better  credit  decisions  by  financial \ninstitutions. In turn, it will enhance the efficiency of the credit line disbursement of subproject 1, \nresulting in maximizing efficiency and effectiveness of ADB development assistance with the \nlimited resources available to Bhutan.  \n \n ", "12 \nC.  The Program \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n37.  The  Program  objective  is  to  initiate  and  undertake  necessary  policy  reforms  to  (i) \nestablish an integrated policy, strategy, and institutional framework for MSME development; (ii) \nenhance business laws and regulations to facilitate MSME operations; (iii) increase access to \nmarket-based finance; and (iv) strengthen the business support infrastructure. The Program is \nintended to stimulate the expansion and growth of the MSME sector and overall private sector \ndevelopment.  \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n \n38.  The Program consists of four components. The output and performance targets of the \nProgram are in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 3). The policy reform actions \nare detailed in the development policy letter and policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \na.  Establish  Policy,  Strategy,  and  Institutional  Framework  for \nPromoting MSME Development \n \n39.  The Government will adopt a clear policy towards supporting and promoting MSME \ndevelopment. This policy will be underpinned by a competitiveness study to determine which \nkey sectors and products have the greatest potential and comparative advantage for the country \nto develop, given its natural resources. As part of this study, supply-chain and value-added \nanalyses  are  to  be  conducted  to  determine  weak  links,  gaps,  and  forward  and  backward \nlinkages in key sectors that need to be strengthened and filled. The study will help focus \ngovernment assistance, and will also help identify different measures that could mitigate these \nconstraints  and  develop  market  mechanisms,  including  the  development  of  clusters, \nsubcontracting arrangements, and joint ventures.31  \n \n40.  The Government has to establish an appropriate institutional framework and structure \nwithin which to effectively deliver Government assistance to the MSME sector. It is therefore \nconsidered  appropriate  to  centralize  functions  relating  to  MSME  development  within  the \nGovernment in order to pursue a well coordinated MSME policy and strategy. As a first step, the \nGovernment has revived the PSDC (to be renamed, or such a body as may be designed after \nthe currently ongoing ministerial organizational development process has been completed) to \nact as an advisory body to assist in policy formulation for private sector development. However, \none problem with the PSDC has been its inability to detail and implement policies and programs \nfor fostering business development. Therefore, a specialized division will be established to \nsupport  the  PSDC.  It  will  focus  on  MSME  development  matters  with  institutional  capacity \nbuilding to define and implement policy, strategy, and programs. It is proposed that an MSME \ndivision at MTI should be formed to facilitate coordination between different ministries, other \ngovernment departments and offices, BCCI, and the private sector. MTI, in consultation with the \nPSDC and with assistance from the MSME division, will prepare and later disseminate a long-\nterm policy, strategy, and incentive framework and program for promoting MSME development \n(based  on  a  competitiveness  study,  and  supply-chain  and  value-added  analyses).  In  the \nmedium term, MTI also needs to draft a rolling 3-year action plan, according to the long-term \nMSME development strategy and  policy, to be immediately adopted for supporting MSME \n                                                 \n31 Based on Bhutan\u2019s natural resources and anticipated demand in various markets, the competitiveness study will \nincorporate available studies that may have already been undertaken by other development partners and explore \nother suitable products that are strategically identified as having growth potential.  \n ", "13 \nsector development. In view of the principal responsibility of the MSME division to promote \nMSME development, the MSME division will also be made responsible for implementing the \nProgram component of the MSME SDP.  \n \nb.  Enhance Business Laws and Regulations and Facilitate Business \nProcesses  \n \n41.  Regulatory  Impact  Assessment.  To  improve  the  current  regulatory  practice  and \nensure  the  regulators  adopt  prudent  regulations,  particularly  for  improving  the  regulatory \nframework for a more conducive business environment, the proposed Program will introduce a \nregulatory impact assessment (RIA) and pilot it on selected draft business laws. An RIA32 is a \nkey tool used to assess the likely effects of a proposed new regulation or regulatory change. It \ninvolves a systematic appraisal of the costs and benefits associated with new and/or existing \nlaws and regulations, and a detailed analysis to ascertain whether or not the new regulation \nwould have the desired impact. RIA also includes a participative process and mechanism \nallowing  all  relevant  stakeholders  to  express  their  views  in  open  discussions  and  to  form \nopinions for lawmaking and review of the impacts of such laws. The adoption of an RIA will \nimprove  the  quality  of  lawmaking,  enhance  good  governance,  and  improve  the  regulatory \ncapacity and performance of the Government. \n \n42.  The introduction, adoption, and institutionalization of RIA will involve four phases. In \nphase one (the preparation phase), an RIA working group will be established, and the RIA \nmethodology will be adapted to the Bhutanese context and introduced to public and private \nstakeholders. One of the tasks of the RIA working group is to prepare a short list of regulations \nto be reviewed. In the second phase (the pilot phase), the RIA working group will review two \ndraft  laws  (currently  Draft  Bhutan  Enterprise  Registration  Act  and  Draft  Industries  and \nInvestment  Act,  or  any  other  legislation  relevant  to  MSME  development)33  and  prepare \nassessment  reports  accordingly.  In  phase  three  (the  evaluation  phase),  the  feasibility  of \ninstitutionalizing RIA will be further assessed. This will include a thorough assessment of the \nimpact of a new RIA policy, which would provide the legal framework needed to institutionalize \nRIA. The purpose of this policy would be to make an RIA mandatory before adopting a new \nregulation, as well as to evaluate existing regulations. In phase four (the institutionalization \nphase), RIA policy and institutionalization plan (e.g., establishment of an RIA unit) would be \nformulated and approved for implementation. RIA is expected to be widely applied in all sectors \nin the future. In addition, at the end of phase four and based on the RIA pilot exercises, the \nreviewed  Bhutan  Enterprise  Registration  Act  and  Industries  and  Investment  Act  would  be \nrevised accordingly and submitted to the National Assembly for consideration. \n \n43.  Business  Formalization  Process.  The  main  objective  of  the  simplification  and \nacceleration of business formalization is to reduce the cost of doing business and promote the \nestablishment  of  new  enterprises,  particularly  in  labor-intensive  manufacturing  and  service \nindustries. The Government has made significant efforts to reduce the time and costs involved \nin the business formalization process. The overall time to start a business was decreased from \n62 to 47 days, as required by the World Bank\u2019s DPG. Since then the Government has further \n                                                 \n32 RIA can help identify any possible side effects or hidden costs associated with regulation, and quantify the likely \ncosts of compliance on the individual citizen or business. Apparently, 17 Organization for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD) member countries, such as Australia, Belgium, Ireland and the UK, have adopted RIA to \nimprove regulatory quality and performance. \n33 The Government is currently considering a separate Investment Incentives Act from the Draft Industries and \nInvestment Act. Therefore, the two business laws selected for piloting RIA will be reconfirmed during program \nimplementation. \n ", "14 \nreduced the days required for business formalization to 43 days. To support the envisaged long-\nterm MSME development strategy and reduce barriers to entry for MSMEs, it is important to \nfurther reduce the days taken for business formalization from 43 to 30 days, and to move closer \nto good international practice.  \n \n44.  One-Stop  Shops.  To  more  efficiently  handle  business  formalization  and  minimize \nbureaucratic procedures, the Government is considering introduction of single access points, or \none-stop shops (OSSs) at the regional level through RTIOs. The introduction of an OSS, which \nhandles business formalization and other bureaucratic processes under one roof, will increase \nefficiency and ease market entry for start-up businesses. Therefore, the MSME SDP proposes \nthat the Government establishes an OSS working group, consisting of government officers from \nall relevant administrative levels, to formulate the model and the functions of the OSS and to \nprepare the action plan to introduce OSSs in the six RTIOs. The Government will also prepare a \nbrochure detailing the process of business formalization, with time and costs involved, for public \ndissemination.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will  introduce  OSS  benchmarks,  which  are \nnecessary to standardize services, increase efficiency in service provision, and improve the \noverall quality of business support services. The benchmark system will comprise indicators \ncovering service efficiency and service quality supported by an appropriate feedback system. \nAuthorities required for the proper functioning of OSSs are expected to be eventually delegated. \nHowever, in view of the multisectoral nature of the OSS, further consultation at the committee of \nsecretaries34 level is required to ensure that the OSS option will work. \n \n45.  Regional Trade and Industry Offices. In Bhutan, the following three government levels \nare involved in the business formalization process: (i) the central level of MTI and the Revenue \nand Customs Office, (ii) the regional level of RTIOs and the regional Revenue and Customs \noffices, and (iii) the authorities which issue local clearances at the local (dzongkhag) level. The \nestablishment of OSS units in the six RTIOs at the regional level will help streamline and further \nreduce  the  time  needed  to  start  up  a  business.  Therefore,  as  the  responsibility  and \naccountability of RTIOs increases, the Government needs to commence review and consider \nestablishing performance benchmarks and a monitoring system for RTIOs. The performance \nbenchmark  should  also  be  disseminated  to  the  public  and  RTIOs,  and  complaints  desks \nestablished to obtain feedback from public users. \n \nc.  Increase Access to Market-Based Finance \n \n46.  The current problems of a segmented lending market, insufficient institutional capacity for \nMSME lending, and a lack of supporting infrastructure (such as a credit information system) \ncontribute  to  limited  MSME  lending.  While  other  institutions  (namely  BOB  and  BNB)  are \nreluctant to expand their loan portfolios to MSMEs, BDFC also faces a shortage of funds, \ndespite its key role in rural and MSME financing. It is necessary to address BDFC\u2019s funding \nshortage  and  institutional  capacity  in  MSME  lending  in  order  to  adequately  address  the \nconstraints  faced  by  Bhutanese  MSMEs  in  accessing  financing,  in  addition  to  other \nimprovement  measures.  The  MSME  SDP  will  therefore  provide  a  credit  line  for  providing \nmedium- and long-term finance to MSMEs via BDFC (see the Project component) along with \nother measures to strengthen BDFC\u2019s performance for improved MSME lending, and to develop \nthe supporting infrastructure to facilitate the use of collateral, that are essential for improving \nmarket-based finance to MSMEs. \n \n                                                 \n34 During the transition for a parliamentary system, the committee of secretaries was established in the absence of \nministers.  \n ", "15 \n47.  Restructuring BDFC with Enhanced Capacity Building. It is identified that there is a \nneed for BDFC to strengthen its corporate governance structure, human-resource strategy, and \nother  relevant  MSME  lending  capacity  to  improve  its  operational  efficiency  and  for  better \nservices delivery to target clients. In particular, the Government envisages that BDFC will \ncontinue to play a central role in providing and improving access to finance for micro and small \nenterprises, especially in rural areas. To achieve such a role, it is therefore recognized that \nthere is a need for BDFC to adopt a new 5-year strategy and business plan which enables it to \noperate on a commercial basis for funding financially and economically viable projects. The \nProgram will assist in ensuring the adoption of BDFC\u2019s 5-year strategy and business plan, which \nwill  include  a  corporate  governance  structure,  human-resource  strategy,  and  performance \ntargets, and be able to further reach out to target clients, especially in rural areas. The technical \nsupport necessary for preparing an adequate BDFC business plan will be delivered under an \nongoing ADB TA 4837 (footnote 16). Skills training in areas of MSME lending techniques and \nhuman-resource management will also be provided under the TA 4837. \n \n48.  Central Registry. To encourage secured transactions and improve the use of collateral, \nthe MSME SDP will set up a central registry where mortgages and other security interest in \nmoveable and immovable property can be registered for use as collateral. A registry is also \nimportant for monitoring and securing \u201clender\u2013borrower/creditor-debtor\u201d transactions, facilitating \ncredit information sharing, and therefore, effectively improving access to credit by businesses. \nIn  view  of  Bhutan\u2019s  small  economy,  a  small  and  cost  effective  central  registry  is  more \nappropriate. Therefore, the Government will establish the central registry at RMA along with the \nongoing establishment of the credit information bureau (footnote 18). Technical support is to be \nprovided under the MSME SDP (under subproject 3) to assist RMA in developing a sound road \nmap and action plan for establishing a centralized public registry for secured transactions. In the \nmedium term, the MSME SDP will support (i) diagnostic review of the existing legal, regulatory, \nand institutional framework for security interests, including drafting and issuing necessary legal \namendments and implementing regulations; (ii) recommendations for establishing a central \nsystem or filing archive for registering collateral and security interests, including its design, \nestablishment,  system  requirements,  and  operation  manuals;  and  (iii)  building  awareness \namong banks, businesses, and other stakeholders. \n \n49.  Rationalization  of  Government  Credit  and  Guarantee  Assistance  to  MSMEs. \nInasmuch as evidence suggests that government subsidized programs and schemes may not \nbe particularly effective, the MSME SDP proposes that the Government review its existing two \ncredit and guarantee schemes (i.e., the EDPLS and CGS) with a view to rationalizing such \nassistance. Because of the inherent negative impact of directing such assistance through the \nbanking system, the assistance will more appropriately be directed through the budget, made \ntransparent, and have a defined period of application to achieve specified purposes. After \nreview and with sufficient justification, the Government, in close consultation with ADB, after \nreview with sufficient justification, will adopt a coherent incentive framework for supporting \nMSMEs, which will include submission of plans to rationalize incentive programs for MSMEs \nwith increased government reliance on market-based finance for MSME assistance.  \n \nd.  Strengthen Business Support Infrastructure \n \n50.  Business Development Services. An important shift in the thinking about BDS in \nrecent years has been that of moving from promoting fully subsidized supply-driven services to \nself-sustaining demand-driven services. In Bhutan, there is a potential commercial market for \nBDS. Therefore, to encourage more efficient resource allocation for Government funds and for a \nsustainable, long-term strategy to develop human resources, the Government should promote \nand broaden BDS support with private sector participation, i.e., promote a commercial BDS \n ", "16 \nmarket. The establishment of a cost-sharing facility (CSF) for entrepreneurs and private BDS \nstart-ups is contemplated under the MSME SDP to provide demand-oriented BDS and meet the \nneeds of local entrepreneurs. \n \n51.  Product Standards and Quality Control. Product standard and quality control are \nimportant to improving competitiveness of products made in Bhutan and gaining access to \ninternational markets for MSMEs. It can also enhance consumer protection in the country. In \n2005, SQCA became a member of the International Organization for Standardization, and, in \n2006,  a  member  of  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission\u2019s  Affiliate  Country \nProgramme. SQCA has been identified as the national enquiry point on Technical Barrier to \nTrade on Bhutan\u2019s accession to WTO. In view of the future role of SQCA as described in the \ndraft Standards Act, and also in accordance with the Good Governance Plus 2005 paper, SQCA \nwill ultimately become the national standards body for standardization and quality control, and \nbe  renamed  the  Bhutan  Standards  Bureau,  becoming  an  autonomous  body  under  the \nadministrative control of a ministry.  \n \n52.  Therefore,  the  Government  should  first  enact  the  Standards  Act  to  centralize  the \nfunctions, delegate responsibility, and ensure accountability of SQCA. In view of the increased \nresponsibility  of  SQCA  and  the  lack  of  a  detailed  action  plan  on  fulfillment  of  SQCA\u2019s \nobligations, the Government will establish a standards working group to (i) review the existing \nlegal framework to incorporate the new standards and control system, and (ii) restructure the \nexisting organization to meet the new institutional requirements. The review should also include \npreparation of an assessment of existing institutional capacity and identify gaps in human \nresources,  knowledge,  and  technology  which  need  addressing  in  order  to  meet  the  new \nfunctions of SQCA and the regulating and implementing agencies (IA). A roadmap and time-\nbound action plan should be also included for prioritization and development of standards and \ncapacity.  The  MSME  SDP  will  provide  technical  support  (under  subproject  3)  to  prepare \nnecessary review, assessment, and a road map and time-bound action plan to enhance the \ninstitutional capacity of SQCA and stakeholders for improved product standards and control \nsystems in Bhutan. \n \n3.  ADF IX Grant \n \n53.  Based on the debt sustainability analysis and the revised Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) grants framework,35 Bhutan\u2014with a debt-GDP ratio of 80% and a debt-exports ratio of \n341%\u2014was classified as one of the most debt-distressed countries, and eligible for 100% of \ngrant  financing  under  the  high  risk  category  of  debt-distress.  ADF  grants  aim  to  provide \ndevelopment assistance to help the country tackle development issues in an environment of \ndebt vulnerability, and assist the country in developing the private sector, creating employment \nopportunities, and achieving sustainable economic growth, without increasing external debt \nburdens. The grant effectiveness will be assessed within the broader context of program and \nproject performance. The design of the MSME SDP and its monitoring framework has clear \nindicators to measure the inputs, activities, and outputs (Appendix 3). \n \n4.  Financing Plan \n \n54.  The  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $6  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources. The grant proceeds are expected to be utilized over a period of 36 months from the \ndate of grant effectiveness. \n \n                                                 \n35 ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila.  \n ", "17 \n55.  The estimated adjustment costs for the Government in undertaking the proposed policy \nreforms are approximately $17 million, based on the medium-term estimate (Table 1). The \nadjustment costs arise from (i) developing the MSME policy and strategy and setting up the \ninstitutional framework for MSME policy implementation, including preparing competitiveness, \nsupply-chain, and cluster studies; consolidating knowledge; and disseminating information to \nstakeholders;  (ii)  enhancing  business  laws  and  regulations,  including  introducing  and \nestablishing OSSs in six RTIOs, simplifying the business formalization process, and piloting RIA \non  selected  business laws;  (iii)  increasing access to  market-based  finance  for MSMEs  by \nadopting and implementing a new 5-year business plan and human-resource strategy by BDFC, \nreviewing and preparing a plan to rationalize the Government\u2019s credit assistance to MSMEs, \nand establishing a central registry at RMA; and (iv) improving business support infrastructure by \nimplementing the CSF at MTI and preparing a plan for testing, standards establishment, and \nproduct certification to improve quality control and product standards. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimate Adjustment \n($ million) \nItem  FY2008  FY2009  FY2010  Total \nEstablish  policy,  strategy,  and  institutional  1.1  0.9  0.9  2.9 \nframework  for  promoting  MSME  development, \nincluding stakeholder consultations \nEnhance business laws and regulations, including  0.9  1.3  1.0  3.2 \npreparation of pilot legislations  \nIncrease access to market-based finance  0.6  1.3  1.5  3.4 \nStrengthen business support infrastructure  1.5  2.5  3.5  7.5 \n    Total  4.1  6.0  6.9  17.0 \nFY = fiscal year; MSME = micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n56.  Program Management. MOF will be the Executing Agency (EA). MTI will be the IA for \nthe whole program, except for two subcomponents: BDFC will be the IA of the component \nrelating to adopting and implementing the new 5-year business plan; SQCA will be the IA of the \ncomponent relating to improving quality control and product standards. \n \n57.  The Government will set up an interagency PSC composed of the secretaries of MTI, \nMOF,  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MOA)  and  the  managing  director  of  RMA,  with  the \nsecretary of MTI as the chair. The PSC will meet every quarter, or as often as needed, to \nmonitor progress, coordinate implementation, and ensure effective fulfillment of the proposed \npolicy reforms. ADB will be entitled to receive all reports and minutes of the PSC, and may \nattend meetings of the PSC as an observer.  \n \n58.  MTI will establish a body (referred to as the MSME division) which will act as the \nprogram and project management unit (PPMU) for MSME SDP implementation. The MSME \ndivision will be headed by a senior MTI staff, responsible for implementing the MSME SDP and \ncoordinating support for program and project administration. The MSME division will have a \ncore group to implement the MSME SDP and also a coordination group to support and oversee \nthe  implementation  of  policy  actions  and  related  projects  under  the  MSME  SDP.  The \ncoordination group will be composed of working representatives of the respective divisions at \nMTI, MOA, the Debt Management Division of the Department of Public Accounts at MOF, RMA, \nBAFRA,  SQCA,  BDFC,  and  from  the  private  sector  through  BCCI,  and  will  monitor  and \n ", "18 \ncoordinate  activities  between  various  entities  involved  in  delivering  outputs.  One  of  the \nrepresentatives will be designated as an alternate director of the coordination group for program \nand project implementation from time to time.  \n \n59.  Period of Implementation. The period of MSME SDP implementation will be a total of 3 \nyears,  estimated  to  be  completed  by  31  December  2010.  The  indicative  implementation \nschedule is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n60.  Procurement  and  Disbursement.  Program  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  for  a \nbroad range of imports, subject to a list of ineligible items (Appendix 5). All procurement of \ngoods and services produced in, and originating from, ADB member countries will be made with \ndue  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard  Government \nprocedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \ndisbursement  of  the  Program  grant  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans (1998, as amended \nfrom time to time). The Borrower will certify that the value of total imports minus (i) imports from \nnonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made under other official \ndevelopment assistance, is greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. \nADB will have the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nBorrower's certification. \n \n61.  Counterpart Funds. The Government will use the local currency funds generated by the \nProgram grant to meet program expenditures and associated costs of reform. The Government \nwill also provide counterpart funds, primarily in kind, to provide facilities for the consulting team \nand to finance taxes and duties on equipment. \n \n62.  Financial Management. A financial management assessment was carried out to ensure \nproper fund management. The detailed assessment, including completed questionnaires, is in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  The  consolidated  financial  management  assessment  and \nrecommendations for the involved agencies are as follows.  \n \n63.  Financial  management  has  been  improved  by  creating  internal  audit  units  in  each \nministry, and by separating aid management from budget and accounts. Particularly important \nfor financial accountability is the inclusion in the latest version of the MOF financial manual of \nbetter  defined  institutional  roles  and  relationships  for  budgeting,  accounting,  and  aid \nmanagement.  The  Financial  Rules  and  Regulations  were  subsequently  issued  and  made \neffective in July 2001, and these incorporate new rules for the delegation of financial powers. \nSignificant improvements have been brought about in the quality and reliability of accounting \ninformation with the adoption of the computerized budgeting and accounting system and central \nbudgeting  system  across  all  Government  spending  units.  The  key  challenge  facing  the \nGovernment is to network the database across the spending units and improve the oversight \nand  control  function,  which  the  Royal  Audit  Authority  (RAA)  is  currently  addressing  by \nenhancing their local area network and audit information management system. \n \n64.  RAA  conducts  regular  audits  and  submits  its  reports,  including  a  set  of \nrecommendations for improvements, to the National Assembly. All financial statements of all \nministries, RMA, and government-owned financial institutions (such as BDFC) are subject to \naudit by RAA within 6\u20139 months of fiscal year closure. The external audit conducted by RAA \nfollows the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institution\u2019s auditing standards, which \nare in line with the International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Federation of \nAccountants. While the evidence suggests that the audit function is largely effective, setting up \n ", "19 \nmechanisms to actively track and monitor the responses to audit observations can help MOF \nfurther enhance the existing audit system.  \n \n65.  Internal audits have been established in all ministries and RMA. The Financial Rules and \nRegulations (2001) manual contains a section on internal controls, explaining their nature and \nobjectives. The internal auditors in MOF do not hold recognized professional qualifications such \nas chartered public accountant. However, their qualifications are based on experience and ad \nhoc courses (such as auditing seminars), including prior experience of successfully managing \nADB  financed  projects,  which  represents  cognizance  of  ADB\u2019s  procedures  and  financial \nmanagement  requirements.  Similarly,  MTI  staff  do  not  have  professional  accounting \nqualifications, but have many years (up to 35 years) of practical experience in accounting and \nfinancial management. Since MTI has no prior  project management experience with ADB, \ntraining in ADB\u2019s procedures and financial management requirements is needed. At BDFC there \nis adequate professional qualification of staff in the finance and IT division (e.g., the compliance \nofficer is a chartered accountant). BDFC has also had successful experience of managing an \nADB-financed credit facility in accordance with ADB\u2019s financial management procedures and \nrequirements  in  the  past.  Therefore,  BDFC\u2019s  financial  management  system  appears \nappropriate, and it can be relied upon for the purpose of project financial management. \n \n66.  Financial management arrangements are found to be satisfactory in general. In view of \nfurther enhancing and updating the EA\u2019s and IAs\u2019 understanding of, and familiarity with, ADB\u2019s \nprocedure and financial management requirements, it is recommended that ADB\u2019s consultation \nand  project  implementation  and  administration  seminars  are  held  during  the  project \nimplementation period.  \n \n67.  Monitoring. ADB will monitor MSME SDP implementation through 6-monthly reviews \nand periodic progress reports to confirm fulfillment of policy actions and advice on actions to \nmaintain implementation within the program period.  \n \n68.  Tranching. The MSME SDP will be for 3 years. The Program grant will be released in \nthree tranches. The first tranche (not exceeding $2 million) is to be disbursed after grant \neffectiveness and upon satisfactory compliance with all the agreed first tranche requirements. \nThe second tranche (not exceeding $2 million) will be disbursed 18 months after the first \ntranche, subject to satisfactory fulfillment of the second tranche release conditions. The third \ntranche (not exceeding $2 million) will be disbursed 18 months after the second tranche, subject \nto satisfactory fulfillment of the corresponding tranche release conditions. The policy matrix \n(Appendix 4) lists all the tranche release conditions. \n \n69.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. An audit of the use of the grant proceeds will be \nundertaken if requested by ADB. ADB retains the right to (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the \nvalidity of the certification issued by the Government for each withdrawal application. Prior to \nwithdrawal, the Government will open a deposit account at RMA to receive all grant proceeds \nunder the Program. The account will be established, managed, operated, and liquidated in \naccordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The PPMU will submit 6-monthly progress reports to \nthe Government and ADB on policy and institutional reforms. The progress report will describe \nprogress made and any changes to the implementation schedule, and identify any problems \nencountered and remedial actions taken.  \n \n70.  Program  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  PPMU  will  establish  and \nmaintain a system to monitor program performance that will include a database on the status of \npolicy  measures  and  program  indicators,  based  on  the  policy  matrix  and  the  design  and \n ", "20 \nmonitoring framework. At the end of the Program period, a program completion report, which \nwill be used as a basis for the end of program review, will be submitted to ADB.  \n \n71.  Program Review. ADB will conduct a comprehensive review 3 months prior to the \nscheduled release of both the second tranche and the third tranche. A program completion \nreview at the end of the MSME SDP will be conducted to evaluate its overall impact on the \nprivate sector, particularly the MSME sector, and the achievement of its desired objectives, as \nwell as other benefits, intended or not, especially for the poor or women entrepreneurs. \n \nD.  The Project \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n72.  The Project objective is to provide the necessary investment and technical support to \nfacilitate access to credit by MSMEs and to ensure smooth implementation of the policy reforms \nunder the MSME SDP. The Project consists of three subprojects to provide (i) a credit line to \nBDFC  to  extend  credit  assistance  to  MSMEs,  especially  micro,  small,  and  rural-based \nenterprises; (ii) a CSF to provide the necessary technical support and knowledge transfer to \ngrowth-oriented  businesses;  and  (iii)  capacity  support  for  program  implementation  and \ninstitutional capacity building to ensure the sustainability of the Program and Project and related \nreforms under the MSME SDP.  \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n \na.  Subproject 1: Increase Access to Market-Based Finance  \n \n73.  Based on historical data on credit demand of MSMEs, the market will face a projected \ncredit demand of at least $43 million in the period 2008\u20132010.36 The supply of credit, however, \nis unlikely to meet the demand in view of the current problems of market failure, insufficient \ninstitutional capacity for MSME lending, and a lack of supporting infrastructure (such as a credit \ninformation system). BDFC, which is keen to lend to MSMEs, is constrained by a shortage of \nfunds  while  other  institutions  (namely,  BOB  and  BNB)  are  reluctant  to  expand  their  loan \nportfolios to MSMEs due to a perceived higher credit risk and administrative costs involved in \ndealing with small borrowers. Bhutanese MSMEs will continue to suffer from limited finance due \nto BDFC\u2019s funding shortage, and due to insufficient collateral. To help overcome the financing \nconstraints faced by MSMEs, a credit line for providing medium- and long-term finance to \nMSMEs via BDFC, and development of the supporting infrastructure to facilitate credit decision \nmaking and collateralization, are therefore being pursued under the MSME SDP. \n \n74.  Credit Line to BDFC for MSME Lending. Despite the fact that BDFC is the only \nfinancial institution focusing on the MSME sector, particularly in rural areas, the need for the \nother two financial institutions\u2014BOB and BNB\u2014to provide medium- to long-term funding was \nexplored.  The  finding  was  that  the  two  financial  institutions  have  increased  their  lending. \nCurrently, only BOB has excess liquidity, accounting for 33% of its total assets after statutory \nliquidity ratio requirements and cash reserve requirements are met.37 Therefore, its need for \n                                                 \n36 The 3-year projection is based on the annual credit growth of MSME loans over 2005\u20132006, which was 12% per \nannum, and the total volume of MSME loans for all financial institutions as of 2006. \n37 However, such excess liquidity is believed to be short-term in nature as the proceeds from the hydropower \nrevenues are deposited with the Bank of Bhutan and turned over to the Government.   \n ", "21 \nexternal long-term funding to MSMEs was low.38 BNB has also extensively expanded its loan \nportfolio in recent years and, consequently, no longer has excess liquidity. However, there was \nno interest in another credit line from ADB, as the previous ADB project (footnote 29) with a \ncredit line was not fully utilized by BNB. Lending has been concentrated in urban areas. \n \n75.  Pre-identification. As confirmed, BDFC is the only financial institution which has a great \nneed for funding, and is the only financial institution interested in offering credit assistance to \nMSMEs,  especially  micro  and  small  enterprises.  It  is  also  the  appropriate  agency  to  help \novercome  the  financial  constraints  of  the  MSME  sector.  BDFC\u2019s  loan  portfolio  growth \nprojections for the next 5 years already exceed the organization\u2019s current funding resources. As \nsuch, to support BDFC in responding adequately to the increasing demand for credit from the \nMSME  sector,  a  credit  line  of  $5  million39  is  proposed.  As  required  by  ADB\u2019s  financial \nintermediary loan modality, other financial aspects of BDFC performance have been reviewed in \norder to assess eligibility. Details are provided in Appendix 6.  \n \n76.  Institutional  Strengthening  and  Capacity-Building  Support  to  BDFC.  To  enable \nBDFC to fully exploit its potential and effectively act as an intermediary in financing, it is \nimportant that BDFC strengthens its structure, operations, and capacity for MSME lending. In \nparticular, BDFC currently has identified the need to (i) review its benefit and incentive structure \nto retain qualified personnel; (ii) adopt a medium- to long-term strategy to address the issue of \nfunding  shortage  in,  and  financing  of,  the  MSME  sector;  (iii)  enhance  good  governance, \nincluding a human resource development strategy, at the branch and regional level; and (iv) \nensure autonomy of its lending operations. Therefore, to enhance BDFC\u2019s efficiency for fully \ncommercialized operations and its ability to further reach out to target clients (especially in rural \nareas), it is necessary to prepare and adopt an appropriate 5-year strategy and business plan \nthat includes a corporate governance structure, human resource strategy, and performance \ntargets. The business plan will be delivered under the ongoing ADB TA 4837 (footnote 16) to \nensure  that  the  necessary  policies,  procedures,  and  lending  mechanisms,  including  the \nenvironmental management system, are in place before disbursement of the credit line to \nBDFC. Relevant skills training in areas of MSME lending techniques and human resource \nmanagement will also be provided under the ongoing TA. \n \n77.  Therefore, subproject 1 will provide credit assistance through BDFC to promote MSMEs \nby providing medium- to long-term and permanent working capital financing (such as stock of \nspare parts, tools, and raw materials). \n \n78.  Size and Use of the Proposed Credit Line. The proposed size of the credit line is $5 \nmillion based on the estimate of credit demand from MSMEs and the market share of BDFC in \nMSME financing (footnote 39). The proposed credit line aims to support the financing of the \nestimated 1,400 additional MSMEs entering the market between 2008 and 2010. The grant \nproceeds will be used to finance new loans advanced by BDFC, and will not be used to \nrefinance the portfolio of old loans or add to the existing portfolio of BDFC.  \n                                                 \n38 The financial institutions have been lending on medium- to long-term loans while borrowing on essentially short-\nterm loans from deposits. As a result, the maturity mismatch in funds could pose a major risk to the stability of \nthese institutions as well as to the financial system as a whole should sudden heavy withdrawal occur. The \nfinancial institutions do not appear to fully recognize this risk, but once they become aware of this mismatch risk, \nthe need for, as well as interest in, long-term funding is bound to increase.  \n39 The amount of credit assistance is proposed based on the gap analysis (approximately $43 million) and the \nexisting market share of BDFC (12%). Consequently, BDFC expects a minimum projected credit demand of around \n$5 million.  \n ", "22 \n \n79.  Lending. The Government will receive $5 million as a grant from ADB\u2019s Special Fund \nresources under the ADF Grants Program. The grant amount is proposed to be made available \nto BDFC under a loan agreement at the weighted average deposit rate (WADR), published by \nRMA from time to time and prevailing on the date of withdrawal. The WADR will be adjusted at \nthree-monthly intervals. The current WADR is estimated at about 3.5% per annum.40 The loan to \nBDFC will have the terms of 20 years maturity including a grace period of 5 years. \n \n80.  Onlending. BDFC will charge the subprojects interest rates based on its cost of funds, \nplus a spread that covers transaction costs and risk of the subloans. That is, BDFC is expected \nto onlend to economically and financially viable MSMEs at prevailing market rates.  \n \n81.  Size of subloans. The maximum size of subloans for individual borrowers is up to Nu2 \nmillion (about $49,000), with a maximum maturity of 7 years, including a grace period of up to 1 \nyear, based on the reasonable assessment of amount and maturity of credit demand by the \ntarget MSMEs. The recommendation will be able to accommodate the existing loan profile of \nBDFC in the growth-oriented MSMEs sector that ranges between Nu100,000 (about $2,500) \nand Nu5 million (about $125,000) with an average maturity of 3 years and more than 73% of \nloans below Nu2 million. It will be also in line with the historical figures of the average MSME \nloan size of all financial institutions of Nu760,000 (about $18,700), and the envisaged growth of \nloan size.  \n \n82.  Eligibility and Selection Criteria for Subloans. The grant proceeds will be used to (i) \nfinance new loans advanced by BDFC, and will not be used to refinance the portfolio of old \nloans of BDFC, or for housing, equity finance, or staff or personal loans; (ii) finance subprojects \nthat are economically and financially viable; and (iii) finance subprojects that comply with the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), except those on the ADB\u2019s exclusion list \n(Supplementary Appendix D). BDFC also will install a basic environmental management system \n(Appendix  7),  with  support  of  the  ongoing  ADB  TA  4837  (footnote  16),  to  screen  the \nenvironmental impacts of project applications (although no adverse environmental impacts are \nexpected from the MSME subprojects to be financed). In addition, MSMEs with an initial capital \ninvestment, which by definition consists of paid-in capital and long-term credit41 of up to Nu100 \nmillion,  are  eligible.  Subloans  will  be  subject  to  BDFC\u2019s  single  borrower\u2019s  exposure  limit \naccording to RMA\u2019s Prudential Regulations (2002) (i.e., no financial institution will extend credit \nto a single borrower exceeding 30% of its capital fund). The selection of MSME subprojects will \nbe based on, but not limited to, the subproject\u2019s (i) domestic demand and export potential; (ii) \npotential for development based on competitiveness study, and supply-chain and value-added \nanalyses; (iii) factor endowments; and (iv) development impacts.  \n \n83.  Allocation  for  Rural  Women  Entrepreneurs.  In  general,  women  entrepreneurs, \nespecially in rural areas, find difficulty in accessing finance in comparison with their male \ncounterparts. Therefore, to facilitate access by women borrowers and improve the livelihood of \nrural  women  (especially  those  who  have  the  ability  to  engage  in  productive  activities),  a \nminimum  of  10%  of  the  credit  line  will  be  allocated  to  lending  to  women  entrepreneurs. \nHowever,  if  the  allocated  funds  are  not  utilized  within  1.5  years  from  the  date  of  grant \neffectiveness, such funds will revert to the general pool. \n                                                 \n40 Based on the WADR available in March 2007, the borrowing cost of funds as reflected in the WADR was 5.1%. \nThe recent WADR (available in May 2007) is 3.5%.  \n41 Royal Government of Bhutan. 2001. Official Classification of Enterprises. \n ", "23 \n \n84.  Appraisal and Approval of Subloans (Free Limit). The Project aims to ensure that the \nbenefit of the Project accrues to MSMEs, and, therefore, the subloan size is limited to a \nmaximum of Nu2 million ($49,000).42 In view of the small-sized subloans and BDFC\u2019s previous \nexperiences  with  ADB  under  earlier  loans  (footnote  28),  there  is  no  free  limit  prescribed. \nHowever, to warrant adequate lending practices of micro and smaller loans for MSMEs, the first \nfive micro loans (below Nu50,000) and first three small loans (below Nu100,000) will be referred \nto ADB for approval. This is intended to ensure that proposed risk policies and procedures \nbased  on  the  recommendations  of  the  ongoing  TA  4837  (footnote  16)  are  adequately \nincorporated into BDFC systems and processes. Subsequently, all subloan applications will be \nsubject to post-monitoring and review by ADB. The ongoing TA 4837 will assess the adequacy \nof the current risk management system at BDFC and recommend appropriate measures to \nensure that the risk management system meets international best practice. Moreover, under the \nongoing ADB FSDP, the capacity of RMA to supervise the implementation of risk management \nsystems of financial institutions is being strengthened. The TA will also provide necessary \nassistance to enhance BDFC\u2019s lending capacity, along with the development of a new 5-year \nstrategy  and  business  plan  to  ensure  that  BDFC  efficiently  and  effectively  intermediates \nfinancing and fully utilizes the funds. BDFC will be required to adopt the new strategy and \nbusiness plan which will be developed by the project preparatory TA team in close consultation \nwith the BDFC board, management, and staff, and further approved by BDFC\u2019s board.  \n \nb.  Subproject 2: Enhance Business Development Services \n \n85.  Subproject 2 will establish a CSF to facilitate demand-oriented private sector BDS and \nMSME start-ups. The function of the CSF is to reduce the cost of external service provision by \ncofinancing projects of successful applicants at a flat rate of 50% of the total project cost. In \ndoing so, it increases the utilization of BDS by MSMEs and thus perpetuates the development of \nMSMEs  and  the  market  for  commercial  BDS.  The  CSF  will  support  projects  which  are \nreplicable. \n \n86.  Subproject 2 will run for a period of 4 years. The CSF will operate on a first come, first \nserved basis, and will have support from the Government in collaboration with BCCI. As there is \nno previous experience in Bhutan with project-related grant facilities, it is recommended that \nthere is an international consultant to assist in facility management during its first year of \noperations for transferring facility management skills and knowledge. The consulting services \nwill be financed through subproject 3 and implemented intermittently over the first and second \nyears of CSF operations.  \n \n87.  Institutional Arrangement of the CSF. A CSF management unit will be set up and \nintegrated with the MSME division in order to reduce the overhead costs of the facility. The \nmanagement  unit  will  be  responsible  for  marketing,  undertaking  project  analysis,  financial \nmanagement, and monitoring and evaluation, and will be accountable to MTI. The unit will \nemploy three local staff from the public sector and public sector institutions. The Government \n                                                 \n42 BDFC\u2019s average size of manufacturing sector loans is about Nu350,000 (about $8,500), while the average loan for \nthe financial sector as a whole is Nu2.6 million (about $63,000). BDFC\u2019s average size of services and tourism \nsector loans is about Nu500,000 ($12,200), while the average for the financial sector is Nu2.5 million (about \n$61,000). The agricultural sector loan size averages about Nu30,000 ($730) for both BDFC and other financial \ninstitutions. Therefore, in view of the existing loan portfolio of BDFC and its envisaged loan size growth, along with \nthe focus of micro- and small-enterprise lending, the free limit design is focused on (i) ensuring adequate lending \npractices, (ii) allowing for the initial batch of projects for ADB\u2019s prior approval and, (iii) with support of the ongoing \nTA 4837, for development of an improved risk assessment system.  \n ", "24 \nwill fund the recruitment of one local staff to manage the CSF, and ADB will fund the other two \nto support management of the CSF under subproject 2. If no eligible people are found, one or \nmore of the following functions will be outsourced: (i) unit management, (ii) marketing, (iii) \nproject appraisal, (iv) financial appraisal, (v) accounting, and (vi) monitoring and evaluation. \nStaff with a strong private sector background will be selected to ensure a close affiliation with \nthe private sector and a great understanding of its needs and requirements, regarded essential \nfor appropriate project appraisals. ADB reserves the right to perform random audit of the CSF \nmanagement unit to ensure adequate and efficient use of funds.  \n \n88.  Approval. A five-member appraisal panel will be appointed, comprising representatives \nfrom MTI, MOA, BDFC, and the private sector. Its function is to review the CSF grant proposals \nrecommended by the CSF management unit. The unit manager of the CSF management unit \nwill be a full voting member of the appraisal panel. A quorum of three members will be required \nto approve applications, by majority vote if necessary. Grants should only be approved where a \nlong-term  strategic  benefit  is  projected.  The  source  of the  applicant\u2019s  contribution  may  be \nthrough the owners\u2019 own funds, or through bank loans or equity participation, or a combination \nof these. The appraisal panel, when approving applicants for CSF grants, will ensure wide \ndispersion of funds. \n \n89.  Eligible Applicants. The main target group for grants will be MSMEs which have a \npaid-in capital below Nu100 million. Private individual MSMEs, recognized groups of MSMEs, \nindividual business service providers, or recognized groups of service providers are eligible for \napplying for the cost sharing grant. Only domestically owned MSMEs or service providers will be \neligible. Parastatals, government entities, and other MSMEs or service providers where the \ngovernment or its agencies have management control by virtue of being the largest shareholder \nor of having a board majority, will not be eligible. Any conflict of interest shall also render such \napplicants ineligible, such as a relationship with any of the Government officials involved in the \nimplementation of the CSF within the immediate family. The CSF supports group activities \ncovering more than one MSME or service provider (such as those sponsored by business or \ntrade associations, BCCI, or organized clusters) where the benefits are widespread. Where an \napplication is made on a group basis, it will be evaluated and processed as a single application. \n \n90.  Selection Criteria for Projects. The following criteria will be applied to select projects \nsupported by the CSF: (i) the projects must be economically and financially viable; (ii) projects \nmust comply with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy,43 (iii) eligible projects, \nexcept those on ADB\u2019s exclusion list (Supplementary Appendix D), will include, but not be \nlimited to, sectors that (a) have domestic demand and export potential; (b) factor endowments; \nand (c) potential for development of MSMEs based on competitiveness study, and supply-chain \nand  value-added  analyses;  (iv)  projects  which  are  replicable,  and  (v)  projects  with  high \ndevelopment impacts. \n \n91.  Eligible Services. For each eligible service usage supported by the CSF, the concerned \nMSME will be expected to provide at least one deliverable aspect. The CSF management unit \nwill verify that the activity has indeed taken place as approved. Depending on the circumstance, \na defined deliverable might consist of, for instance, (i) a detailed engineering drawing, (ii) a \nproduct  prototype  incorporating  quality  improvements,  (iii)  a  training  certificate,  or  (iv)  an \nexternally commissioned market report. Samples service usage includes in-factory consultancy \n                                                 \n43 To ensure the approved projects will not generate adverse environmental impacts, the CSF management unit will \nimplement  a  basic  environmental  management  system  framework  (see  Appendix  7)  that  is  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, with support from environmental officers in concerned departments \nor agencies at MTI, and/or technical assistance of subproject 3.  \n ", "25 \nand short-term contract management services; for example, usage up to 3 months duration per \nexpert would normally be eligible, but new permanent staff appointments would not. The length \nof time for which temporary contract management could be supported will depend on how long \nthe required transfer of expertise could reasonably be expected to take. Priority will be for \nservices that can eventually be easily replicated. \n \n92.  Eligible Expenditures. Expenditures on service fees, and expenditures on travel and \nincidental expenses charged at cost, incurred wholly and exclusively on CSF-approved service \nand travel, will be eligible for grant support. Salaries for staff employed by MSMEs are not \neligible,  nor  are  recurrent  costs  such  as  royalty  fees  and  capital  expenditures.  No  single \nrecipient MSME or group of MSMEs may receive total grants in excess of a cumulative limit of \n$25,000 (project costs of $50,000) unless expressly approved by the appraisal panel. In this \ncontext, MSMEs are considered to be a group if their annual accounts are reported together in \none  document,  if  they  are  owned  by  the  same  entity,  or  they  are  under  the  effective \nmanagement control of the same board or entity. \n \n93.  Size of Grant. The CSF will operate countrywide. It is estimated that about 25 large \nprojects with a grant volume of $12,500 and about 225 projects with a grant volume of $2,500 \nwill be realized during the 4-year implementation period.44 The CSF will limit applications by \napplying a minimum grant volume of $1,000 (project cost $2,000) and a maximum grant volume \nof $25,000 (project cost $50,000) to keep administrative costs at a tolerable level and ensure \nthat the main potential beneficiaries are served.  \n \nc.  Subproject  3:  Program  Implementation  and  Institutional  Capacity \nBuilding \n \n94.  Subproject 3 will provide technical advice and resources needed to support and facilitate \nprogram implementation. In particular, capacity building and institutional development will be \ncrucial for conducting certain policy actions and facilitating crucial project implementation for \nMSME development. The components of subproject 3 are discussed as follows. Terms of \nreference for subproject 3 are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n95.  Component 1: Formulation of MSME Development Strategy and Support of the \nCSF Management. This component will assist the PSDC (or such body as may be designed for \nthe  purpose  through  the  MSME  division  at  MTI)  in  formulating  a  coordinated  MSME \ndevelopment policy, strategy and institutional framework, and MSME development program. It \nwill do this by conducting (and accessing existing) competitiveness studies of various products \nand  services  in  order  to  identify  and  prioritize  specific  agro-  and  strategic  industries  and \nproducts. It will also prepare cluster and supply-chain analyses to determine weak links and \nareas for assistance. The technical support will be conducted in close consultation with the \nprivate sector, e.g., BCCI and stakeholders.  \n \n96.  Component 1 will also provide technical support to management of the CSF in (i) setting \nup procedures, (ii) establishing eligibility criteria for MSMEs and service providers, (iii) designing \ndata collection and monitoring systems, (iv) processing and appraising applications, and (v) \n                                                 \n44 The anticipated demand for grants and average sizes under the CSF is calculated based on (i) the projected total \naverage number of MSMEs during the project implementation period, based on the latest statistics from MTI and \nusing an exponential trade formula; (ii) target concentration in the key sectors that are likely to utilize BDS (e.g., \nmanufacturing and service sectors); (iii) information on average yearly spending on MSMEs from the MSME \nmarket survey under an ADB TA (footnote 9); and (iv) cost modeling for average anticipated projects (e.g., \ninternational consultant support and study and/or trade-fair tours to countries in the region).  \n ", "26 \nfacilitating CSF impact assessment and evaluation. It is expected that facility management skills \nand  knowledge,  including  grant  scheme  management,  human-resource  development, \nmarketing, and monitoring and evaluation, will be transferred to the domestic CSF manager and \nother staff in the facility.  \n \n97.  Component  2:  Capacity  Building  for  Introduction  of  RIA.  This  component  will \nprovide technical support and resources needed for regulators and staff in the RIA working \ngroup  to  build  capacity  and  to  pilot  RIAs.  This  component  includes  conducting  necessary \nstakeholder  workshops,  consultations,  and  training  modules  (including  on-the-job  training \nmeasures and study tours) for RIA implementers.  \n \n98.  Component 3: Establishment of a Central Registry. Component 3 will support the \nestablishment  and  implementation  of  a  central  registry  at  RMA.  This  component  includes \npreparation of a feasibility study,45 including identification and drafting of the necessary legal \nand  regulatory  framework,  costing  of  appropriate  hardware  and  software  equipment,  and \npreparation of request for proposal for procurement of consulting services and equipment. \nCurrently, RMA is considering a two-phased approach. The first phase will create a preliminary \ndatabase which lists existing collateralized properties recorded with the financial institutions. It \nwill also involve the input of consultancy services for preparing an establishment plan, including \nrecommendations on the legal framework, legislation, and equipment needed to consolidate all \nthe registration information including immovable properties and also allowing for registration of \nmovable  assets.  The  second  phase  will  subsequently  implement  the  establishment  plan, \narrange links and networks, and make the central registry fully operational. \n \n99.  Component 4: Planning the Establishment of Product Standards and Capacity \nBuilding. This component will assist in reviewing the legal framework and developing the \norganizational arrangement of the new Bhutan Standards Bureau (a national standards body as \nenvisaged  in  the  Good  Governance  Plus  2005  paper  and  the  upcoming  Standards  Act). \nComponent  4  will  also  assess  and  recommend  the  division  of  tasks  between  the  various \nparticipants in the new standards and control system. This component will assist in (i) the \nelaboration of phased and prioritized action, (ii) assessment for laboratory needs not covered by \nthe United Nations Industrial Development Organization, (iii) estimation of additional equipment \ncosts, (iv) assessment of staff requirements, and (v) the development of a human-resources \ndevelopment plan and costs.  \n \n100.  Component 4 will pay particular attention to the institution building of BAFRA, as quality \nimprovements in food value chains are a priority for MSME development in Bhutan. As the \npresent staff numbers and qualifications do not allow BAFRA to satisfactorily fulfill its tasks in a \ngrowing market, there is a need to build capacity within BAFRA in the discharge of its specific \nfunctions.   \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n \n101.  The total project cost is estimated at $10.60 million, including contingencies. The cost \nbreakdown by subproject is: (i) subproject 1, credit line to BDFC, $5.24 million; (ii) subproject 2, \nCSF,  $1.04  million;  and  (iii)  subproject  3,  institutional  capacity  building  and  program \nimplementation,  $3.05  million  (Table  2).  A  detailed  cost  estimate  is  in  Appendix  8.  The \n                                                 \n45 The feasibility study will be in line with the ongoing preparation and establishment of the credit information bureau \nin view of establishing a cost-effective structure to manage credit information in Bhutan. Therefore, a joint \norganization at RMA to manage credit information as well as mortgages and relevant charges will be considered.   \n ", "27 \nGovernment has requested a grant of $9 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to support \nthe Project.46 A financing plan for the Project is provided in Table 3. \n \nTable 2: Cost Estimates  \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amounts \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n102.  Project Management. MOF will be the EA. BDFC will be the IA for subproject 1, and \nMTI will be the IA of subprojects 2 and 3. In view of the close coordination and complementary \ndesign  of  the  Program  and  Project  components,  the  PPMU  (i.e.,  the  MSME  division)  will \noversee, manage, and coordinate implementation with direct support from representatives of \nconcerned agencies (see para. 58), including submission of information and analysis, and \ncoordination of consultants.  \n \n103.  Procurement and Consulting Services. Procurement of goods and services will be \nsubject to the provisions of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Consultants will be recruited in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement packages for subproject 3 \nare  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9).  The  Government  will  be  responsible  for  the \nprocurement plan, and ADB will carry out review of all documents, including the request for \nproposal, shortlist, technical evaluation of proposals, award recommendations, and contracts, \nbefore issuance by the Government. \n \n104.  Details of procurement of consulting services are illustrated in Table 4. A total of 68 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  128  person-months  of  national \n                                                 \n46 Component 2 of subproject 3 is financed by AusAid through RETA 6337 (footnote 30). \n ", "28 \nconsulting services will be financed by the Project grant. For subproject 2, long-term national \nstaff  will  be  engaged  using  an  individual  consultant  selection  method.  For  subproject  3, \nconsultancy firms will be recruited in accordance with the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod.

Disbursement Arrangements. The Project grants will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To ensure timely \nrelease of ADB funds for eligible expenditures, two imprest accounts will be established at RMA, \none for each IA. The first imprest account (for BDFC) will finance all activities under subproject 1 \nsubject to executing of the loan agreements in place between BDFC and the Government \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  second  imprest  account  (for  MTI)  will  finance  all  activities  under \nsubprojects 2 and 3. The Division of Debt Management at the Public Accounts Department of \nMOF will be responsible for managing the imprest account and ensuring timely release of funds. \nThe  combined  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  accounts  will  be  for  6  months  of  estimated \nexpenditures  or  10%  of  the  Project  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating \nadvances to the imprest accounts for any individual payment not exceeding $50,000.  \n \n106.  The Project grant will be available for 4 years, particularly considering the disbursement \nschedule of the credit line to BDFC (Subproject 1) and the CSF (Subproject 2). In addition, for \nsubproject 1, BDFC will recycle the funds for new subloans after the earlier approved subloans \nare paid off. Lending by the Government to BDFC will be a fixed period of 20 years, inclusive of \na 5-year grace period. \n \n107.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. The PPMU will maintain separate records and \naccounts for the imprest accounts in accordance with sound accounting principles and will have \nthese accounts and records audited annually in accordance with standards acceptable to ADB. \nAudited accounts, including statement of expenditures, will be provided to ADB within 6 months \nof fiscal year end. ADB retains the right to (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the \ncertification issued by the Government for each withdrawal application. The audit will provide an \nopinion on the imprest accounts and statement of expenditure operations. \n \n ", "29 \n108.  The PPMU will submit reports to ADB concerning the use of project grant proceeds, \nproject administration, and financial management. The reports will include (i) 6-monthly and \nannual project implementation reports, (ii) a midterm review report, and (iii) a project completion \nreport  to  be  submitted  no  later  than  6  months  after  project  completion.  The  reports  and \nconsolidating  inputs  from  the  IAs  will  cover  (i)  expenditures,  (ii)  activities  financed,  (iii)  a \nsummary of audit issues, and (iv) the progress of project components. \n \n109.  The consultants recruited under the Project grant will prepare (i) an inception report \nwithin 1 month of service commencement; (ii) midterm reports at appropriate stages of the \nProject; (iii) a draft final report 2 weeks before completing the contract; and (iv) a final report \nafter incorporating comments from ADB, the EA, and the IAs. A tripartite meeting between the \nGovernment, ADB, and the consultants will be carried out prior to the finalization of each \nundertaking and the termination of each contract.   \n \n110.  ADB has assessed the financial management capacity of the EA and IAs and found that \nin general the EA and IAs are satisfactory at a program and project level (see paras. 62\u201366). \nHowever, since MTI has no prior ADB project management experience, MTI representatives \nresponsible  for  project  implementation  will  undergo  a  project  implementation  training  and \nworkshop  in  enhancing  institutional  capacity  and  project  management  prior  to  undertaking \nactual project implementation under the MSME SDP.   \n \n111.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. The PPMU, drawing on data from \nIAs, will establish and maintain a project performance management system that will generate 6-\nmonthly and annual reports. The system will be linked with the Program and established, as \nagreed between the Government and ADB, to ensure that (i) the Project is managed efficiently, \n(ii)  benefits  are  maximized,  and  (iii)  environmental  and  social  impacts  are  minimized  and \nmitigated.  \n \n112.  Project  Review.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  periodically  review  project \nimplementation.  ADB  will  field  regular  review  missions,  including  midterm  and  project \ncompletion  review  missions  to  coincide  whenever  possible  with  the  program  reviews.  A \ncomprehensive midterm review at approximately 18 months from the date of grant effectiveness \nwill be undertaken to evaluate progress. These reviews will include (i) an evaluation of the \nproject scope, (ii) implementation arrangements, (iii) a review of environmental management \nsystem (EMS) performance at BDFC and environmental due diligence at the CSF, and (iv) \nprogress with the policy reform agenda. \n \n113.  Anticorruption. In conformity with the recommendations of ADB\u2019s Second Governance \nand  Anticorruption  Action  Plan,47  which  specifies  that  program  and  project  design  should \nincorporate findings of governance, institutional, and corruption risk assessments, and that \nproject  documentation  should  clearly  identify  risk  and  risk-management  and  mitigation \nmeasures. The summary of the findings is as follows.  \n \n114.  Many funding agencies\u2019 reports on sectoral assessments indicated that the Bhutanese \npublic sector is relatively free of systemic institutional corruption.48 A proxy measure49 to analyze \nthe level of corruption in the public sector indicates a generally decreasing trend in assessed \n                                                 \n47 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II). Manila. \n48  For example, the World Bank has stated that the Government has \u201ca long-standing reputation for honesty and \nprofessionalism\u201d. (World Bank. 2004. Bhutan Country Brief. Washington, DC). \n49  The measure looks at total amounts cited by RAA audits that are due to the Government from public sector bodies \nfor expenditures unallowable under existing Government rules (e.g., the Financial Rules and Regulations). \n ", "30 \nunallowed  expense  amounts  based  on  RAA\u2019s  audits.50  Recently,  RAA  has  become  more \naggressive in fulfilling its functions as a result of the extended mandate due to the enactment of \nthe Audit Act (2006) as well as improved staffing and capacity. Therefore, RAA is more likely to \nfind instances of misuse of public funds than before. However, total monetary irregularities have \nbeen reduced significantly as compared with earlier annual reports; irregularities were about \nNu264,208 million in 2005, down from Nu369,339 million in 2004. Even though there has been \nno system-wide corruption assessments or analyses conducted to date, it is fair to conclude that \nBhutan has a low risk of systemwide and institutionalized corruption in the public sector. \n \n115.  The Government has taken serious steps to prevent corruption. Anticorruption policy \nactions include (i) the drafting of an anticorruption law designed to help detect, prosecute, and \npunish perpetrators of any corrupt practices;51 (ii) encouraging the incorporation of legal units in \nevery public body to address legal issues and strengthening internal audit of departments; (iii) \nrevising  procedures  for  procuring  goods,  awarding  contracts,  bidding,  and  licensing;  (iv) \ninstituting a zero-tolerance approach to raise the risks corrupt elements face; and (v) instituting \na system in which an audit clearance certificate is a prerequisite for each staff member\u2019s \npromotion,  training,  and  contract  extension.  Bhutan  has  been  progressing  in  adopting  the \nfollowing anticorruption policies: (i) the Anticorruption Act (2006) has been enacted; (ii) the \nGovernment,  with  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  is  in  the  process  of  strengthening  the  anti-money \nlaundering and combating financial terrorism regime by (a) enhancing the legal framework, (b) \ninstituting  the  financial  intelligence  unit,  and  (c)  establishing  a  reporting  and  monitoring \nprocedure for recording and investigating suspicious financial transactions (supported by the \nFSDP); and (iii) the RAA, an autonomous body which  conducts all types of audits on all \ngovernment  agencies,  joint  sector  corporations,  financial  institutions,  nongovernment \norganizations, and externally funded projects, has adopted the performance audit as part of the \noverall audit approach to look at the use of public resources for, and the impact on the people \nof, an integrated report on the economic, efficient, and effective use of public funds.  \n \n116.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project or the MSME SDP. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EA and IAs, and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. During regular review \nmissions, governance and anticorruption risk assessments will be updated as necessary. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n117.  Benefits. The MSME SDP is expected to contribute to inclusive growth in Bhutan by \npromoting the development of the MSME sector (and thereby the private sector), through an \nintegrated  and  comprehensive  strategic  approach  to  MSME  development,  an  enhanced \nbusiness environment, improved access to credit by MSMEs through a financially stronger \n                                                 \n50  The unallowed expenses include (i) procurement without tendering, (ii) wasteful expenditures, (iii) irregular contract \nmanagement, and (iv) nonlevying of liquidated damages. The levels of such expenditures reflected in RAA audits \nare as follows: 2001: 809; 2002: 638; and 2003: 514.  \n51  The Anticorruption Act (2006) allows for establishing a three-member anticorruption commission with extensive \npowers mandated to, among others things, \u201ctake all necessary actions to prevent and combat corruption.\u201d \n ", "31 \nBDFC with enhanced institutional capacity and outreach and better use of security and credit \ninformation; and increased BDS for enterprises to access training, technology, marketing, and \ninformation. As a whole, MSMEs are expected to benefit from the holistic approach adopted by \nthe MSME SDP to have (i) an enabling policy and regulatory environment for doing business, (ii) \nbetter access to financing, (iii) enhanced business support infrastructure, and (iv) increased \nmarket access and product competitiveness for sustainable economic growth. It is estimated \nthat more than 1,400 enterprises will gain access to finance for business expansion and at least \n250 enterprises will receive training and technical support, on a cost-sharing basis, during the \nproject implementation period.  \n \n118.  Furthermore,  due  to  the  improved  connectivity  and  accessibility  in  rural  areas  and \nbetween urban and rural areas achieved by the East-West National Highway project (footnote \n29) supported by ADB\u2019s projects, the focus of the MSME SDP on micro and small enterprises, \nincluding rural enterprises, is envisaged to enhance employment opportunities for the poor and \nimprove  the  livelihood  of  rural  people.  The  benefits  of  the  micro  and  small  business \ndevelopment on the livelihood of rural people will have incidental effects on other aspects of \ntheir lives, such as education, health, and service delivery, due to the joint impact of higher \nincomes and better access to markets. In addition, the business expansion by MSMEs and \nenhanced private sector growth will further help absorb the increasing numbers of young people \nand recent graduates entering the labor force and broaden the base for economic activities. The \ninvolved  agencies  and  institutions  are  also  expected  to  benefit  from  the  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity development under the Project, which will enhance their operational \nand administrative efficiency and effectiveness for MSME development.  \n \n119.  Impacts. The MSME SDP is classified environmental category FI as it involves a credit \nline through BDFC. The credit line involves only small loans (see para. 81). In addition, BDFC\u2019s \nsubloans to MSMEs will be largely in the sectors of trade and services, tourism, transport (light \nvehicle)  and  agro-processing;  none  will  be  in  infrastructure.  It  is  unlikely  that  significant \nenvironmental impacts, involuntary resettlement, or negative impacts on indigenous people will \noccur. The social and poverty impact of the MSME SDP is in Appendix 10.  \n \n120.  To  further  ensure  no  adverse  environmental  impact  occurs  as  a  result  of  project \nimplementation, the eligibility criteria for subloans will comply with the government and ADB's \nsafeguard policies and will be enhanced through BDFC's implementation of the EMS (Appendix \n7) prepared in accordance with applicable environmental requirements of the Government and \nof ADB. Similarly, the eligibility criteria for MSMEs applying for grants under the CSF includes \ncompliance  with,  or  commitment  to  comply  with,  Government  and  ADB  environmental \nrequirements. In addition, BDFC is advised not to lend to companies in the exclusion list (see \nSupplementary Appendix D), and will report any violation or noncompliance by their borrowers \nwith  health,  safety,  and  environmental  regulations  to  ensure  that  the  onlending  by  BDFC \nadheres to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and that there is no adverse impact from subloans \nfinanced from the credit line. ADB will also provide necessary training, including design of a \nbasic EMS, to BDFC under the ongoing TA 4387 (footnote 16) and the CSF at MTI under \nsubproject 3, to further strengthen its institutional capacity for environmental safeguards.  \n \n121.  Risks and Mitigating Measures. Three categories of possible risks can be expected for \nthe MSME SDP: (i) policy reversal, (ii) program and/or project implementation and coordination \nrisks among involved agencies, and (iii) institutional capacity of project implementing agencies. \nThe MSME SDP has incorporated mitigating measures as appropriate and possible to attenuate \nthe impacts associated with the risks.  \n \n ", "32 \n122.  The  first  category  of  possible  risks  involved  during  program  implementation  is  the \nslowing-down of policy momentum. This is emphasized in Bhutan because of the impending \ntransition  of  the  country  into  a  parliamentary  democracy  by  2008.  However,  given  the \nconservative and traditionalist view of the voting population and political parties, a parliamentary \ndemocracy is likely to enhance rather than impede the broad-based ownership of the reform \nactions, and policies adopted by the present regime are expected to continue. In addition, the \nnew  parliament  is  expected  to  be  filled  with  representatives  not  only  with  the  requisite \nexperience but also the qualifications needed to respond to the new challenges facing Bhutan \nduring modernization. In addition, as the Government has established a private sector working \ngroup to assist in the formulation of the next midterm development strategy (the Tenth Five-\nYear Plan52), this indicates a continuous important role for MSME development in economic \ngrowth in the next 5 years. Therefore, the Government is expected to remain committed to the \nreform agenda undertaken by the MSME SDP to promote the MSME sector, ensuring private \nenterprise participation in the growth process. \n \n123.  The activities and policy reforms for MSME development involve multiple sectors and \nwork across ministries. Therefore, a lack of close coordination among relevant government \nagencies to support and oversee program and project implementation is the second category of \npossible risk to the success of the MSME SDP. To mitigate such coordination failure, the MSME \nSDP will ensure smooth implementation through an adequate institutional mechanism at two \nlevels: a PSC at the interministerial level, and a dedicated MSME division at the implementation \nlevel. In addition, to ensure a participatory consultative process and public-private partnership \nfor  providing  necessary  checks  and  balances,  the  MSME  SDP  will  have  private  sector \nrepresentation,  through  the  inclusion  of  private  sector  representatives  and  their  active \nparticipation  in  the  MSME  division  through  the  BCCI,  in  order  to  contribute  and  provide \nfeedback on program and project implementation.  \n \n124.  The  third  possible  risk  involved  is  limited  institutional  capacity  for  successful \nimplementation of the Program and Project components, particularly the implementation of the \ncredit line at BDFC and the CSF at MTI. The risks associated with the capacity constraints will \nbe mitigated by allocating adequate resources to provide technical support to involved agencies, \nincluding BDFC and the MSME division. The technical support to BDFC will be provided by the \nongoing  TA  4837,  which  will  help  prepare  the  5-year  business  plan  and  strategy,  and \nsubsequently assist in implementing the business plan and skills training for better MSME \nlending and effective credit line assistance. Subproject 3 will provide capacity building to the \nMSME division to support the implementation and management of the CSF and disbursement of \nthe grant. Other relevant capacity-development support to involved agencies such as SQCA are \nalso incorporated into subproject 3 to ensure smooth program implementation. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n125.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated into the legal documents. \n                                                 \n52 The Tenth Five-Year Plan (2009\u20132013) is currently under preparation. The Government of Bhutan has established \nseveral working groups to focus on the priority areas for country development.

A  significant  number  of  businesses  are  concentrated  at  the  foothills  of  the \nHimalaya along the Indian border in the (southern) districts of Chhuka, Samtse, Sarpang, and \nSamdrup Jongkhar (29%). Finally, there are some businesses in the eastern central districts, \nincluding Trashigang, Mongar, and Bumthang along the central lateral road (12%).  ", "36  Appendix 1 \nB.  Sector Analysis for MSME Development \n \n4.  The Bhutanese economy is basically centered on subsistence agriculture. The agriculture \nsector  (including  mining)  employs  approximately  45%  of  the  total  labor  force  but  contributes \nrelatively  little  to  overall  sector  growth  (only  1.2%  in  2005).  The  industry  sector  (including \nmanufacturing, hydropower, and construction) accounted for 2.6% of sector growth but engages \nonly about 16.1% of the total labor force. The services and trade sector grew the fastest at 13.3%, \nand employs 19.5% of the total labor force, contributing the most to real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth in 2005. As evident, in terms of employment importance, the agriculture sector \nrepresents the key economic activity of the country; nonetheless, the relative low contribution to \noverall GDP growth underlines hidden unemployment and low productivity. On the other side, the \nimportance of industry (especially manufacturing), the services, and trade sectors is underscored \nby their apparent growth potential and their looming importance for job creation and for broad-\nbased economic development.  \n \n5.  The  following  sections  provide  a  sector  analysis  and  illustrations  of  potential  growth \nproducts in each sector, which is particularly relevant to MSME development.  \n \n  1.  Agriculture Sector \n \n6.  The agriculture sector, which comprises agriculture proper, livestock production, forestry, \nlogging, mining, and quarrying, had a GDP share of about 23.8% in 2005, down from 24.7% in \n2004. It employed about 60% of the total labor force in 2004 and 44.7% in 2005, and is a key \nsource of livelihood for most Bhutanese people. However, the growth of agricultural productivity \nhas been limited due to the difficult terrain, poor soil quality, and limited availability of cultivatable \nland, which is approximately 7.7% of the total land area. In addition, lack of market access is \nanother major reason why farmers are reluctant to produce a crop surplus beyond what is required \nfor  barter  transactions.  Despite  facing  constraints  of  production  enhancement,  the  agriculture \nsector is slowly shifting to cash-crop production, such as fruit and vegetables, as these offer more \nviable sources of income as these products enjoy seasonal advantages and large markets in \nneighboring countries such as Bangladesh and India.  \n \n7.  Under  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan,  a  total  of  41,300  farmers  were  trained  in  cash-crop \ncultivation and 225 kilometers (km) of farm roads were constructed to improve access to markets. \nDue to Bhutan\u2019s landlocked and mountainous geographic location and poor access to the rest of \nthe world via sea and air routes, only high-value products or those enjoying seasonal comparative \nadvantage are able to overcome the disadvantage of high transport costs for exports. These have \nbeen largely confined to tree crops, vegetables, and spices. Three commercially significant crops \nare oranges and areca nuts in the subtropics and apples in the temperate areas. Altogether, they \naccount for 96% of the horticultural trees planted and 92% of total production.  \n \n8.  Domestic and Export Market. With respect to domestic demand, imported produce is \nincreasing as urban populations grow and tastes move to higher-value products. Although the \nlarge markets in India and Bangladesh can absorb all that Bhutan can produce, limited land and \nthe huge variety of microclimates1 have constrained the establishment of large-scale farming. \nAgricultural exports include oranges, apples, potatoes, cardamom, ginger, chilies, vegetables, and \nprocessed fruit products, and the destinations of exports include India, Bangladesh, Singapore, \n                                                 \n1  A microclimate refers to a local atmospheric zone where the climate differs from the surrounding area. The term may \nrefer to areas as small as a few square feet (for example a garden bed) or as large as many square miles (for example \na valley). One of the contributing factors to microclimate is the slope or aspect, which is the case in Bhutan. \n ", "Appendix 1  37 \nand Japan. Exports to countries other than India and Bangladesh could be increased with the \nintroduction of product certification and use of international standards. \n \n9.  Constraints. While agriculture is turning more to cash-crop production and the contribution \nof tree crops has been increasing in recent years, the share of the total agricultural sector to GDP \nis decreasing. This is due to the decreasing contribution of cereals, livestock, and food crop \nproduction as a result of natural causes and the specialization brought about by free trade with \nIndia. In view of the good potential for food crops to be cultivated in the agro-ecological zones,2 \nimproved seeds and management practices are necessary to develop the agro-industry through \nexports of low-volume, high-value products in a favorable environment like Bhutan.  \n \n10.  Target Industries and Products with Growth Potential. Bhutan\u2019s comparative advantage \nin the agricultural sector derives from its wide range of microclimatic conditions (i.e., many valleys \nwith different altitudes and/or slopes) that allows cultivation of a large variety of produce. Coupled \nwith the fact that its neighbors are mainly tropical agricultural producers and that Bhutan is able to \nproduce temperate zone crops 1 month later than its neighbors, Bhutan is virtually the only source \nof supply for fresh produce during certain periods of the year in the region. As such, Bhutan has \ngreat potential in two areas: (i) in low-volume, high-value products aiming at niche markets based \non  comparative  advantages  such  as  the  range  of  microclimates,  biodiversity,  and  organic \nproduction; niche-crop production could include essential oils, traditional medicines, mushrooms, \nand incense; and (ii) in larger-scale, foreign-investment businesses in border areas based on the \ncomparative  advantages  of  flexible  labor,  a  stable  political  environment,  and  competitive \ninfrastructure, predominantly using imported raw materials. To exploit this potential, firms will need \n(i)  access  to  competitive,  consistent,  and  high-quality  raw  materials  in  a  timely  manner;  (ii) \nsupportive policies on transport, labor, and investment; (iii) an innovative approach to productions, \nprocesses,  packaging,  and  product  marketing;  and  (iv)  improved  productivity  through  better \nmanagement and enhanced labor skills. In addition, forward linkages of products (e.g., supply \nchains) should be fully explored.  \n \n  2.  Industry Sector  \n \n11.  In 2005, the industry sector as a whole accounted for 34.4% of overall GDP. Specifically, \nthe manufacturing sector contributed 7.3% of GDP, hydropower 10%, and construction 17%. Total \nemployment of the construction and hydropower sectors amounts to 14.1% of the total labor force, \nwhile the manufacturing sector engages only 2%. However, as most construction projects are \nhydropower-related, and as these have gradually been completed, the construction sector has \nshown signs of negative growth in 2005. In addition, due to the low employment elasticity (i.e., \nsensitivity of growth of employment with respect to sector growth) of the hydropower sector and the \nrelative unwillingness of Bhutanese to participate in the construction sector, it is imperative that \neconomic activity is diversified by promoting private sector activity, especially in the MSME-related \nsectors, such as the manufacturing and service sectors.  \n \n12.  Bhutan\u2019s manufacturing sector is still small, technologically backward, and state dominated. \nMost private businesses are small or cottage enterprises. The Bhutanese manufacturing industries \nare  highly  dependent  on  processing  primary  products  with  low  value  adding,  such  as  food \n                                                 \n2\n Agro-ecological zones are defined based on the combinations of soil, landform and climatic characteristics. The \nparticular  parameters used in the definition focus on the climatic  and soil requirements of crops and  on the \nmanagement systems under which the crops are grown. Each zone has a similar combination of constraints and \npotentials for land use, and serves as a focus for the targeting of recommendations designed to improve the existing \nland-use situation, either through increasing production or by limiting land degradation. The Ministry of Agriculture has \nreleased 25 improved varieties of rice, wheat, maize, and oilseeds. In the past, high-altitude areas like Bumthang could \nonly grow buckwheat, wheat, and barley, but rice cultivation has now begun using high-altitude varieties. ", "38  Appendix 1 \nprocessing, sawmills, distillery, and furniture-making. The main products include liquors, agro-\nbased edible items, stranded wire, cables, plaited bands of copper, base metals or metal products \n(such as iron, steel, coins, and kitchenware), and mineral products (such as mineral oils and \ncement). Other manufactured goods available in the domestic market are mostly imported from \nneighboring countries. Due to the inadequate industrial environment and infrastructure, the lack of \nskill and technology, and the high cost of production, activities in the manufacturing sector have \nbeen very limited. \n \n13.  The  manufacturing  sector  in  Bhutan  is  dominated  by  agro,  mineral,  and  wood-based \nindustries. In the agro-processing industry, Bhutan produces a narrow range of fresh produce and \na  smaller  range  of  processed  food  products  in  a  very  few  product  categories.  In  2000,  fruit \nprocessing contributed over 90% to employment in the manufacturing sector\u2014excluding alcoholic \nbeverages. The relatively unorganized food-processing sector is dominated by small firms\u2014none \nof  which  are  foreign  owned\u2014comprising  99  micro  and  small  enterprises,  nine  medium-sized \nenterprises, and nine large enterprises as of 2006.  \n \n14.  Domestic  and  Export  Market.  The  market  for  agro-processing  and  food  products \nproduced by small enterprises is mainly local. There are only some large food processors who sell \nover 65% of their production to India, a small amount to Bangladesh, and the remainder locally. \nFor the mineral industry, the processed minerals are mainly exported to India and other countries \nfor use as inputs in higher value-added goods. For wood and wood products, the domestic market \nis fragmented; one is for individuals in rural areas for construction of private houses and the other \nis for commercial construction funded by the Government or donors for large hydropower projects \nor for the renovation of temples. The export market for wood and wooden products is very limited, \nbecause since 1999 the Government has banned all export of logs, sawn wood, and semifinished \nproducts.  \n \n15.  Constraints.  In  the  agro-processing  and  food-processing  sectors,  impediments  to \ncompetitiveness are at the front of the value chain, including the cost, availability, and reliability of \nraw materials delivered to the processors. The relative efficiency in financing, manufacturing, \npackaging, branding, marketing, and distribution, as well as the overall business environment, are \nconstraints to further developing the sector. Specifically, scale, modern processing, management \nsystems, and brand awareness are critical factors that Bhutanese processors will need to address \nfor product development. Realistically, Bhutan\u2019s role will only be as a niche market player. In spite \nof the lucrative future of niche markets, Bhutan is apparently having difficulty penetrating these \nniche markets, which are price-sensitive to product quality.  \n \n16.  Target Industries and Products with Growth Potential. In view of the small scale of \nagro-production in Bhutan, Bhutanese enterprises have to identify specialty and niche products for \nsmaller markets. Organic produce is identified as such. In fact, much of the farming system in \nBhutan is organic, but this advantage has not been leveraged because of a lack of awareness of \norganic farming systems, infrastructure, marketing facilities, access to capital, and ability to capture \neconomies of scale. The major hurdles to be overcome include high certification costs, lack of \nmarket information and marketing strategies, insufficient export facilitation, complex procedures in \nimporting  countries,  and  tariff  and  nontariff  protection  in  import  markets.  Certification  and \naccreditation are especially important for this sector, because in most cases exporters depend on \ncertification by international certification bodies to be able to market their products as organic in \nforeign markets. Costs of certification vary but can be significant. Despite the difficulty that Bhutan \nmay have in establishing a national certification infrastructure, it is imperative to start the planning \nof establishing a certification and accreditation system for sustainable development in the agro-\nbased or food-processing industry. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  39 \n17.  Given  the  range  of  microclimates  and  extent  of  biodiversity,  high-value,  low-volume \nproducts such as essential oils and those that can be used as traditional medicines represent \nanother  potential  growth  area.  Bhutan  has  a  further  advantage  in  producing  a  full  range  of \nproducts, both high- and low-altitude species; however, an apparent lack of technology and skills \nseverely handicaps the development of these high-value products.  \n \n18.  Another product with export potential is handicrafts, including wooden handicrafts (including \nwooden statuettes, wooden caskets, basketware, vegetable plaiting material and plaiting material, \nand incense), natural dyes, and handwoven textiles. For this type of product, exporters can target a \nlarge number of common markets. There are two potential advantages: (i) to develop further new \nmarkets not currently supplied by other exporters of wooden handicrafts, and (ii) to work within \nexisting markets by distinguishing Bhutanese products under the \u201cBhutan\u201d brand. Major markets \ncould include the United States, Switzerland, or other European countries, including tourists that \nvisit those countries. \n \n19.  The Government has adopted a restrictive policy in the timber and wood-based industry. To \nfurther  develop  wood-based  products,  there  is  a  need  to  review  whether  sustainable  forest \nmanagement could supply both the domestic and export markets for wood in order to move \ntowards a future in which the environmental impact could be minimized and the demand for wood \nis filled. For other areas (such as finished wood products and processed mineral goods), Bhutan \nmust  invest  in  skill  and  technology  that  allow  growth  in  the  industries  while  respecting  the \nenvironmental needs of the country.  \n \n  3.  Service and Trade Sector \n \n20.  The performance of the service and trade sector3 has been impressive in recent years. \nMuch development has taken place in the tourism industry, with benefits spilling over to the service \nsector. Sales activities in the hotels and restaurants have been improving over the years. The \nsector growth increased to 13.3% in 2005, as compared to 12.4% in the previous year. It is \nimportant to note that this sector represented almost 42% of the overall nominal GDP in 2005.  \n \n21.  Tourism.  Bhutanese  tourism  began  around  1974  and  is  a  sector  with  great  earning \npotential for the Bhutanese economy. Since its inception, the development of the tourism industry \nis  consistently  guided  by  the  country  policy  which  is  to  ensure  the  preservation  of  Bhutan's \nenvironment, traditional culture, and values. As a result, tourism development focuses on a high-\nend market, with low numbers of high-paying tourists. Most importantly, it is the country\u2019s desire to \nensure that Bhutan\u2019s unique and delicate cultural heritage is not overpowered by large numbers of \nvisitors entering the country. Thus, facilities and services (hotels, airline services, and roads) have \nnot yet had to cater to large numbers of tourists.  \n \n22.  In a span of almost three decades, tourist arrivals have risen from 287 in 1974 to 13,626 in \n2005. The tourism sector continues to be recognized as a priority sector with immense growth \npotential and as a major source of income for the Government. Tourism revenues have increased \nconsiderably, from $12.5 million in 2004, to $18.5 million in 2005, and $24 million in 2006. More \nimportantly, the tourism sector is wholly run by the private sector, and, therefore, has significant job \ncreation implications for Bhutan's growing working population. Yet, as of 2005, only 1.6% of the \ntotal labor force was engaged in the hotel and restaurant industry.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Data regarding the service and trade sectors is referred to the tertiary sector data and analysis in the annual report of \nthe Royal Monetary Authority. The trade and service sector includes wholesale and retail trade; restaurants and hotels; \ntransport, storage, and communications; finance, insurance, and real estate; community, social, and personal services; \nand private social, personal, and recreational services. ", "40  Appendix 1 \n23.  Tourism is the largest source of convertible currency earnings. Tourism receipts consist of \nroyalties and taxes collected from tour operators. In the high season, each tourist pays $200 per \nday, of which a 10% commission is given to the overseas agent and the rest goes to Bhutan. Out \nof the receipts to Bhutan (i.e., $180), 35% is the agreed royalty to the Government, 2% is the \nwithheld tax to the Government, and each tour operator receives $111.40 per day.  \n \n24.  Constraints. There are some factors that could affect the sustainability of the tourism \nindustry. Firstly, tourist arrivals in Bhutan are subject to pronounced seasonality. Around 70% of all \ninternational visitors arrive in the month of April and during September\u2013November, which are the \nbest months with regards to weather and are ideal for trekking, and religious and cultural festivals \ntake place all over the country around this time. At other times of the year there is little activity, \nespecially during January\u2013February and June\u2013July. Consequently, there is a significant shortage \nof facilities during the peak seasons and a lack of business in the low seasons. Secondly, tourist \ndestinations are limited due to the limited transport access to different parts of the country. Tourism \nin  Bhutan  is  still  densely  concentrated  in  the  districts  of  Paro,  Thimphu,  Punakha,  and \nWangdiphodrang. Few tourists manage to visit parts of the central valleys such as Trongsa and \nBumthang. The current average length of stay is 6 days, with the entry point to the country in the \nwest. Therefore, the objective of developing tourism throughout the country is yet to be achieved.  \n \n25.  Thirdly, there are a number of infrastructural impediments to increasing the capacity of the \ntourism industry. Due to the country\u2019s difficult terrain, roads are difficult and time-consuming to \nbuild, maintain, and upgrade. Bhutan\u2019s high altitude also does not allow night flights or alternative \ntransport in case of foggy and rainy weather. There is only one airport open for day flights. \nRecently,  telecommunications  have  been  improving;  however,  internet  bookings  and \ncommunication  should  be  further  facilitated.  Other  areas  to  be  further  improved  for  tourism \ndevelopment include the supporting infrastructure of tourism, such as better local transport and \nmore or better banking services, including automatic teller machines connecting to overseas banks \nand greater acceptance of credit cards. \n \n26.  Target Industries and Products with Growth Potential. The tourism sector could grow \neven further with the introduction of the following initiatives to address the above constraints. First, \nto reduce seasonality, the country needs to attract new clients who usually travel through South \nAsia and Southeast Asia during Bhutan\u2019s low season. Opening new entry and exit points through \nSamdrup, Jongkhar, and Gelephu would lead to the spread of tourism benefits to the central and \neastern region. In addition, other potential tourism products include new trekking routes (such as \naccess to Merak and Sakten in eastern Bhutan) and new products such as white-water rafting, \nelephant treks, paragliding, mountain biking, and wildlife and bird watching. Manas and Zhemgang \n(Tingtibi) are other areas with enormous potential for specialized tours for bird and orchid lovers. \nOpening up these areas would help overcome problems with seasonality and add more value to \nthe industry, and would also spread benefits to the existing tourism areas.  \n \n27.  Niche-market travelers usually have broad travel experience and high levels of education, \nand  therefore  high  levels  of  expectation.  To  maintain  good  service  to  the  target  groups, \nprofessional levels of services, ranging from basic sanitation and hygiene in hotels to preparation \nof food, should be further enhanced. Other long-term improvements should include air access, \nroads, and other transport services.

Establishment and Its Social Mandate. The Bhutan Development Finance Corporation \n(BDFC) was formed as a development organization on 31 January 1988 under a Royal Charter \nwith  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  equity  participation  of  the \nGovernment  and  other  financial  institutions.  As  the  only  development  finance  institution  in \nBhutan, BDFC is mandated to provide credit to both small and medium-sized industrial and \nagricultural activities in Bhutan, especially in rural areas. Subsequently, in December 1990, \nBDFC was registered as a company under the Companies Act (2000) and as a financial \ninstitution under the Financial Institutions Act (1992). \n \n2.  Capital Structure and Sources of Funding. BDFC has an authorized capital stock of \nNu200 million. The paid-up capital is Nu100 million, of which the Government holds 87%, the \nBank of Bhutan (BOB) 7.5%, the Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan 3% and the Bhutan \nNational  Bank  (BNB)  2.5%.  Since  the  Government  owns  the  majority  of  shares,  BDFC  is \nclassified as a government-owned corporation. As a nonbank financial institution, BDFC does \nnot have direct access to the domestic savings market (other than for existing group borrowing \ncustomers). Since incorporation, BDFC has thus been the recipient of both loans and grant \nfunding  from  various  donors  such  as  ADB,  the  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arabic  and  Economic \nDevelopment, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development as well as grant funding \nfrom the Government. BDFC also has raised some long-term funds locally from the National \nPension and Provident Fund, BNB, and BOB, using some of the excess liquidity of the financial \nsector. However, BDFC\u2019s loan portfolio growth projections for the next 5 years already exceed \nthe organization\u2019s current funding resources. Therefore, there is a need to raise additional \nfunding  and  improve  lending  to  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSME), \nparticularly the small entrepreneurs. \n \n3.  Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Requirements. The minimum capital requirement is \n8%  of  risk-weighted  assets  for  all  financial  institutions,  according  to  the  Royal  Monetary \nAuthority\u2019s  (RMA\u2019s)  Prudential  Regulations  (2002).  BDFC\u2019s  risk-based  capital  ratio  was \ncalculated  at  42%  in  2006.  The  astonishingly  high  ratio  was  due  to  the  fact  that,  as  a \nnondepository financial institution, BDFC\u2019s equity was mostly sourced from grants, reserves, \nand retained earnings, which were well above the minimum requirement. In addition, as a \nnonbank financial institution, BDFC was required to maintain a minimum 10% of total liabilities \nas liquidity. As of the end of 2006, BDFC\u2019s liquidity ratio was 13.9%, exceeding the statutory \nliquidity requirement by a small margin. \n \n4.  Composition of Directorate and Management. To date, BDFC has not been able to \ndiversify  its  ownership.  The  board  of  directors,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  Finance,  has \nremained dominated by the Government which is exercising its governance over BDFC through \ndifferent ministries (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of \nAgriculture). The management structure consists of the managing director, who is appointed by \nthe Government, and four general managers, who are responsible for finance, credit operations, \nbranch operations, and central support. BDFC\u2019s corporate governance structure and policies \nand  risk  management  functions  are  not  adequate  compared  to  existing  volumes,  portfolio \nstructure, and best banking practices. Therefore, the ongoing TA1 will assist BDFC\u2019s board and \nsenior management to adequately execute their oversight function. In addition, the recently \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  Bhutan  for  Preparing  the  SME/Microenterprise  Development  Program: \nFinancing Component. Manila (TA 4837-BHU approved on 11 September). \n ", "Appendix 6  61 \napproved Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP)2 has measures to improve corporate \ngovernance  in  the  financial  sector  as  a  whole.  It  will  enable  RMA  to  enforce  corporate \ngovernance of all financial institutions via processes such as an appropriate board structure with \na minimum of 50% participation from the private sector, and the implementation of a fit-and-\nproper test for the board of directors.  \n \n5.  Corporate Strategy and Business Plan. In 2003, BDFC revised its strategy with ADB \nassistance,3 and developed its Five-Year Business Plan (2003\u20132007). A detailed operational \nplan was developed for the first 12 months to guide BDFC\u2019s management in the implementation \nof the new strategy. However, due to the shortage of management skills and staff (as BDFC \nkept losing staff due to high turnover) and in the absence of any further external assistance, \nBDFC was not able to follow through with the implementation of the recommended business \nplan. The human-resource deficit and quality improvements are to be addressed in the ongoing \nTA 4837 (footnote 1) which, in consultation with management and staff of BDFC, will formulate \na human-resource development strategy in parallel with the business plan in order to develop \nthe MSME sector. 4 \n \n6.  Branch Network and Rural Outreach. BDFC currently has a head office in Thimphu, \nthree regional offices (one each in the western, central, and eastern regions), 22 branches (one \nin every dzongkhag [district], except in two large dzongkhags which each have two branches), \nand a mobile banking facility operational in 120 gewogs (blocks). The western region has nine \nbranches, the eastern region has seven branches, and the central region six branches. The \ncountrywide distribution network makes BDFC accessible to most people, including those in \nrural areas, on a regular basis, and capable to service the majority of the rural communities in \nBhutan.5 As of December 2006, BDFC had 16,000 active clients in rural areas, or 18.6% of total \nrural households. However, the operational costs of the rural lending operations are relatively \nhigh compared with its revenues.  \n \n7.  Human Resources. At the end of 2006, BDFC had 171 employees, of which 54 work at \nthe head office. Staff turnover has constantly been high during the past 5 years, the principal \nreasons  being  the  comparatively  low  salary  levels  at  BDFC  compared  to  other  financial \ninstitutions, and staff being released subsequent to fraud cases at branch level. Because of high \nstaff turnover and underinvestment in human resources and skills development, many staff \nmembers lack experience, and many loan officers do not have the appropriate skills for a proper \nproject appraisal. BDFC needs to aggressively address this issue through a thorough and \nstandardized training curriculum for loan officers. A human-resource department division was \nestablished in 2003 to obtain and secure sufficient staff through adequate human-resource \nmanagement; however, the division currently has only limited authority. The division is primarily \nproviding administrative support, while all decisions related to human resources and training are \nstill made by the management committee. Therefore, in view of the need for a better human-\nresource system, the ongoing TA 4837 (footnote 1) will provide consultancy and relevant skills \ntraining to address the issues of human resources and skills development. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Financial Performance. The operating income from 2001 to 2006 has shown a 146% \ngrowth from Nu78.1 million to Nu191.8 million. The net profit before tax has shown a similar \ntrend, increasing from Nu24.0 million in 2001 to Nu88.2 million in 2006, a growth of 267%. The \nnet margin has improved from 31% in 2001 to 46% in 2006. The net profit referred to above is \narrived at after providing for provisions and write-offs amounting to Nu92.9 million during the \nperiod under review. No dividends have been declared during the lifetime of BDFC (see tables \nA6.1 and A6.2 for more financial data of BDFC for the years ending 31 December 2001 to \n2006.) \n \n9.  Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue have been decreasing. The figure was \nin the 30\u201335% range up to 2002, since when it has been in the 25\u201330% range, and was 27% in \n2006. Return on equity has also been increasing, from 7% in 2001 to 13.1% in 2006. Return on \nassets was 6.2%, which was marginally below the rate of 6.8% achieved last year, but both \nwere significantly better than the industry average. The declined return on equity figure is largely \ndue to the poor performance of BDFC\u2019s branch offices.  \n \n10.  BDFC  now  prepares  separate  accounts,  including  a  balance  sheet,  for  the  branch \noffices. The total equity of BDFC has been split up between the branches and the head office on \nthe basis of the source of donations and the purpose for which such donation was given. On this \nbasis, the return on equity from branch operations was only 6.1% compared to a return of \n20.7% on head office operations.  \n \n11.  Loan Portfolio Analysis. BDFC has witnessed remarkable loan portfolio growth over \nthe last 5 years, with an average annual growth rate of 20.5% between 2001 and 2006. In 2006, \ntotal outstanding loans (principal) grew by 19.6%. This evolution comprises a growth in the \nnumber of active borrowers (17,667 as of December 2006); however, compared to 2005, there \nhas been a slight decrease in average disbursed loan size per client for loans of up to Nu5 \nmillion (classified as MSME loans). BDFC currently has loans exceeding Nu1.0 million on an \naverage in the manufacturing, mining, and tourism sectors. Only 94 (or 0.6%) of BDFC\u2019s clients \nhave received loans exceeding Nu2 million, and out of these 26% were for housing and mining. \nThe average maturity of the BDFC loan portfolio is currently 3.16 years and only 10% of the \nborrowers have received a loan with a maturity exceeding 5 years. Concentration is low in the \noverall loan portfolio, with the top 10 borrowers representing 19.7% of the total portfolio. The \nlargest customer exposure accounted for 11.3% of equity and 5.5% of loans; this was to a \nleading consortium of companies in the manufacturing and service sector. \n \n12.  BDFC makes provisions for loan losses as stipulated in the Prudential Regulations \n(2002)  given  by  RMA.  Based  on  the  guidelines  and  definition  of  90  days  overdue  as \nnonperforming  loans  (NPL),  the  NPL  ratios  as  percentage  of  total  loans  have  improved \nsignificantly since 1998. The NPL ratio declined from 36% in 1998 to 18.7% in 2002,6 and \nfurther to 15% in 2006. However, the highest NPL ratios are in the agriculture (31% in 2005 and \n32% in 2006) and service industry sectors (16% in 2005 and 17% in 2006). In addition, the NPL \nratio for BDFC branch operations (24% in 2005 and 25% in 2006) is higher than that of the head \noffice (16.6% for 2005 and 13.7% for 2006). The unsatisfactory portfolio quality at the branch \nand sector levels indicates insufficient capacity at the branch levels as well as a need to further \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1997.

The ongoing TA \n4837 (footnote 1) will therefore assist BDFC in enhancing its institutional capacity in MSME \nlending skills as well as in developing suitable services and products to meet the needs of target \nsector clients. \n13.  The  current  loan  loss  provisioning  policy  used  by  BDFC  is  in  compliance  with  the \nPrudential Regulations (2002). The loan loss is 100% fully provided. However, the current \nPrudential  Regulations  have  a  lenient  timeframe  for  substandard  loan  classifications.  For \nexample,  substandard  loans  can  go  for  as  long  as  12  months  before  being  classified  as \ndoubtful. Doubtful loans are declared as loss after 24 months. Loan loss provisions that would \nhave  been  written  off  after  12  months  using  international  standards  remain  on  the  books \nindefinitely. This is because financial institutions are not able to write the loan loss provisions off \ndue to a lack of a write-off policy in the country, as well as the difficulty faced in obtaining the \ncourt orders needed to write off bad loans. While the ongoing FSDP is addressing the issue of \nloan classification in conformity with international best practice, there is also a need for BDFC to \ndevelop a write-off policy7 to recognize the bad loans that have been overdue for a very long \ntime. Some loans are delinquent more than 10 years in the book. Specifically, in view of the \nrecent improvement of BDFC\u2019s portfolio, it reveals that most of the existing NPLs in the book are \nthose long-standing NPLs and thereby do not reflect the accurate value of the institution's \nassets. In this regard, the ongoing TA 4837 (footnote 1) will assist BDFC in developing an \nadequate write-off policy to resolve the issue of long-standing, accumulated NPLs in addition to \nproviding institutional capacity building. \n \n14.  Scope  of  Lending  Operations.  BDFC\u2019s  scope  of  operations  includes  loans, \ninvestments,  financial  services,  and  project  development.  BDFC  provides  term  loans  with \ndiffering maximum maturities depending on sector (e.g., up to 10 years for manufacturing sector \nand up to 5 years for handicraft or cottage sectors); the average term is 3.16 years. According \nto BDFC\u2019s loan classification, as outlined in BDFC\u2019s credit manual, the maximum loan amount \nfor micro enterprises is Nu50,000 and for small enterprises Nu1 million, whereas medium-sized \nenterprise loans will not exceed Nu5 million. Loans are primarily approved on the basis of \ncollateral rather than on character assessment and cash flow analysis, due to the lack of \nappropriate project appraisal skills among loan officers. There is no formal policy for offering \ndifferential interest rates based on the client\u2019s credit rating or term, but for type of loans. Interest \nrates are between 12 and 16%, with the exception of group lending where the rate is 10%. \n \n15.  Project  Appraisal  and  Monitoring. Many  procedures  and  policies,  including  credit \noperating  procedures,  reporting  requirements,  and  formats  are  outlined  in  BDFC\u2019s  credit \nmanual.  Nevertheless,  formalization  and  application  of  these  procedures  remain  areas  of \nweakness and the guidelines for project analysis lack detail and do not appear to be rigorously \napplied. Whereas BDFC\u2019s credit appraisal process entails greater scrutiny for larger loans, the \nanalysis of smaller loans is mainly reduced to the valuation of collateral. The loan approval \nprocess is decentralized with a hierarchical scale of delegated authority and approval limits \nstipulated by the credit committee or the board of directors.8 BDFC\u2019s loan processing time from \nreceipt of application to approval ranges from 1 week to 4 months, depending on the loan size \nand response of the sponsors.  \n \n                                                 \n7  Write-off will have an impact on the portfolio quality but no impact on the financial statements as provisions have \nalready been fully provided.  \n8  Branch offices have loan approval authority up to Nu30,000, and regional offices have loan approval authority up to \nNu100,000. Loans up to Nu5 million are approved by the head office\u2019s credit committee, and loans larger than Nu5 \nmillion are approved by the board of directors. \n ", "64  Appendix 6 \n16.  Loan Eligibility Criteria. Detailed guidelines on borrower and project eligibility are laid \nout in the credit manual. In general, projects that show business viability and generate adequate \nreturns to repay the loan are eligible for financing. A debt-equity ratio of not more than 75:25 \nand adequate collateral of 1.0\u20131.5 times to cover the loan amount is requested. In addition, \nwhen appraising new loans for new projects or companies which affect the environmental \nfactors  reviewed  by  the  National  Environmental  Committee,  BDFC  requires  a  copy  of  the \ncertificate before the credit approval is made. There is no internally developed environmental \ndue-diligence  procedure;  however,  the  system  of  requiring  certificates  from  the  National \nEnvironmental Committee ensures a minimum environmental standard for new projects. \n \n17.  Accounting and Compliance with Statutory Requirements. Overall, BDFC follows \naccounting  standards  consistent  with  the  requirements  for  the  banking  industry  and  is  in \ncompliance with the RMA statutory and regulatory requirements.9 BDFC has a well functioning \nand reliable accounting system that produces detailed reports at both the consolidated and \nbranch level. The chief financing officer and finance team have strong accounting skills and are \nknowledgeable in financial analysis. BDFC has its accounts and financial statements, including \nbalance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and other related statements, audited \nannually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an independent external auditor10 from \nIndia. An internal audit unit has been set up at head office to ensure proper management of the \nsystems, and guard against misuse and irregularities. As of November 2006, an internal auditor \nhas been assigned to each of the three regional offices to guard against further misuse and \nmanage the fraud cases at branch level.  \n \n18.  Management Information System. BDFC is in the process of converting from its micro \nbanker system to an internet-based banking system with SQL Server 2000.11 This is being \ndeveloped in conjunction with a Dhaka based software company (Southtech Limited) and BDFC \nis aiming for a complete conversion to the new system (including all branches) by the end of \n2007.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector Development Program \n(MSME SDP) is designed to promote a vibrant micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise \n(MSME) sector and encourage private sector development for sustainable economic growth. To \nachieve this goal, the MSME SDP contains credit line assistance of $5 million to increase \naccess to finance for MSMEs, particularly in rural areas. \n \n2.  The only financial institution participating in the credit facility is BDFC. The proposed \ncredit line aims to support financing of an estimated 1,400 additional MSMEs entering the \nmarket  between  2008  and  2010.  The  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  new  loans \nadvanced by BDFC and will not be used to refinance the portfolio of old loans or add to the \nexisting portfolio of BDFC. The maximum size of subloans for individual borrowers will be Nu2 \nmillion (about $49,000), with a grace period of up to 1 year and a maximum maturity of 5 years. \nBased  on  historical  figures,  the  average  MSME  loan  size  in  BDFC  is  Nu760,000  (about \n$18,700) with an average maturity of 3 years. \n \n3.  Despite the fact that the size of the onlending funded through the credit line is relatively \nsmall  and  has  insignificant  environmental  impacts,  a  basic  review  of  the  environmental \nmanagement  system  framework  of  the  country  as  well  as  BDFC  (including  the  review \nprocedures of subprojects) is provided as follows.  \n \nB.  Environmental Policies and Guidelines  \n \n4.  The  Government  of  Bhutan  (the  Government)  has  implemented  very  stringent \nenvironmental rules and regulations since 1990. The principle of environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment was included in the national environmental strategy as well as the country midterm \ndevelopment  plan  (i.e.,  various  5-year  plans).  As  a  result,  the  Government  prepared  and \nenacted the Environmental Assessment Act in 2000, and further adopted the Regulations for \nEnvironmental  Clearance  of  Projects  (2002)  and  Regulations  for  Strategic  Environmental \nAssessment (2002). Subsequently, 10 guidelines were issued and implemented to provide \nsectoral instructions for environmental compliance in the areas and/or sectors of (i) environment \ndischarge standard, (ii) forestry, (iii) mines, (iv) tourism, (v) highways and roads, (vi) industrial \nprojects, (vii) overhead utilities, (viii) storm-water drainage system, (ix) electricity transmission, \nand (x) urban development. It is worth mentioning that the preparation of the abovementioned \nenvironmental legislation and relevant regulations were supported by the technical assistance of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 ADB\u2019s technical assistance also included training to \nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the government agencies responsible for implementing \nenvironmental assessment and clearance procedures. It is noted that the current environmental \nmanagement system (EMS) in Bhutan meets international standards and closely follows a \nformat provided by ADB.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening Environmental Impact Assessment \nCapabilities and Preparation of Environmental Guidelines. Manila (TA 2531-BHU approved on 13 February); ADB. \n2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening Environmental Sector Capacity Project. \nManila (TA 4120-BHU approved on 27 May); and ADB. 2005. Technical assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \nCapacity Building to Implement Environmental Assessment Procedures. Manila (TA 4636-BHU approved on 22 \nAugust).  \n ", "Appendix 7  67 \nC.  Environmental Assessment and Clearance Procedures \n5.  In Bhutan, the main framework for environmental protection and assessment is a system \nof  issuance  of  environmental  clearance  certificates  from  the  National  Environmental \nCommission (NEC). The NEC was established under the Environmental Assessment Act, and is \nauthorized  to  issue  environmental  clearance  certificates  in  all  sectors,  except  for  smaller \nprojects and sector-specific projects, in which case NEC authorizes the competent authorities to \nissue environmental clearance for projects in their respective sectors.  \n \n6.  Under the Environmental Assessment Act, any project or any person is required to \nconduct environmental assessment and obtain environmental clearance before starting up. That \nis, all enterprises need to submit satisfactory environmental assessment documents in order to \nobtain government environmental clearance for business formalization. The issuance of an \nenvironmental  clearance  is  also  a  prerequisite,  regardless  of  whether  the  issuance  of  the \ndevelopment consent (e.g., license, lease, or permit for land use, construction, or business \noperation) is needed. Environmental clearance is required at all stages of business operations. \nIn addition, the environmental clearance certificate needs to be renewed at least every 5 years, \nunless a shorter period is stated in the environmental clearance. Considering the stringent \nenvironmental policy, rules, and regulations, the current practice of all financial institutions when \ngranting new loans for projects or companies is to acquire a copy of the certificate before the \ncredit approval is made. As such, the current procedure followed by the financial institutions, \nincluding BDFC, is implicitly in accordance with the country system, even though there is no \ninternal environmental due-diligence procedure. Additionally, the current system of requiring \ncertificates from NEC ensures a minimum environmental standard applies to new projects.  \n \nD.  Basic Environmental Management System at the Bhutan Development Finance \nCorporation \n7.  In  spite  of  the  existing  stringent  environmental  management  system  and  clearance \nprocedure for all projects and businesses, there is a need to develop a basic EMS at BDFC to \nincrease its capacity for preliminary screening of all projects requesting loan approval. A basic \nEMS will include the following. \n \n(i)  Screening  the  proposed  subproject  to  ensure  that  it  is  not  included  in  the \nExclusion List.2  \n(ii)  Using  simple  project  classification  criteria,  the  proposed  subproject  will  be \nclassified category A, which will include projects which have a negligible or nil \nimpact on the environment, or category B  which will include potentially low, \nmedium,  and  high  polluting  projects,  according  to  the  significance  of \nenvironmental  impacts.3  The  need  for,  and  level  and  type  of,  environmental \nassessment  to  be  undertaken  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s Regulation for the Environmental Clearance of Projects (2001). \nWhile  the  guideline  is  deemed  to  produce  environmental  assessment \nrequirements  similar  to  those  of  ADB,  in  case  of  inconsistency,  ADB\u2019s \nclassification criteria and the associated environmental requirements will apply. \n(iii)  Projects that are classified category A will be certified as such by the BDFC \nenvironmental officer and accepted for financial appraisal in the normal course of \n                                                 \n2  The exclusion list confirmed by the participating financial institution, i.e., BDFC, is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n3  The simple project classification criteria will be consistent with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental \nclassification for projects.  \n ", "68  Appendix 7 \nbusiness.  \n(iv)  An environmental officer at BDFC will be appointed in the project department for \nhanding all activities related to environmental impact issues. The officer will be \nresponsible  for  (a)  reviewing  all  the  environmental  information  of  projects  to \nmanage the risks, (b) ensuring compliance with all government environmental \nregulations, and (c) as applicable, ensuring compliance with ADB environmental \nassessment  requirements.  The  environmental  officer  will  train  all  appraisal \nofficers in the initial environmental screening of all projects and will supervise \ntheir work in this aspect.  \n(v)  When the location of a proposed project falls within one or more of the sensitive \nareas as identified by the Government, or when the project is identified as a \npotentially medium or high polluting industry, the environmental officer will ensure \nthat  the  sub-borrower  complies  with  Government  and  ADB  requirements, \nincluding  obtaining  official  clearance  of  concerned  agencies  along  with  the \nenvironmental clearance. Specifically, as part of the due-diligence process, the \nenvironmental officer will (a) review the subproject executing agency (EA) report \nto  assess  the  environmental  risks  and  adequacy  of  mitigation  measures \ndesigned  for  the  subproject,  (b)  ensure  that  the  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation process was conducted in accordance with government and ADB \nrequirements, (c) ensure that complaints from affected people and/or the public \nwere appropriately considered in the subproject EA report, and (d) that the cost \nof implementing the mitigation measures including monitoring was estimated and \nreflected in the EA report.  \n(vi)  The  environmental  officer  will  conduct  a  site  visit  to  validate  or  update  the \ninformation or to verify his or her findings. \n(vii)  The environmental officer will also review the clearances received by the sub-\nborrower  from  NEC  or  the  component  authorities  which  are  the  agencies \ndesigned by the Government to issue clearances. \n(viii)  Findings of the environmental officer will be taken into account in the subproject \napproval process.   \n(ix)  The  environmental  officer  will  monitor  and  record  the  implementation  of \nenvironmental  safeguards  for  category  B  subprojects  as  defined  under  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Regulation  of  Environmental  Clearance  of  Project  (2001)  and \nrecommend corrective actions, as needed. \n(x)  BDFC will make use of government environmental guidelines and handbooks in \nundertaking due diligence and implementing the recommended environmental \nmitigation measures, including those on health and safety. \n(xi)  BDFC will prepare and submit an annual environmental monitoring report to ADB \nwithin 90 days after the close of its financial year.  \n(xii)  In the event that a significant or material health, safety, or environment-related \naccident or incident occurs in a subproject, BDFC will notify the borrower and \nADB immediately (within 24 hours) upon becoming aware of the matter and \nindicate the proposed corrective actions to be taken. Upon the request of ADB, \nthe financial institution will arrange access for ADB staff to visit subprojects to \nverify compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements.  \n \n8.  Capacity Development. The ongoing ADB TA 48374 will provide necessary technical \nsupport  to  prepare  the  basic  EMS  and  in-house  training  programs,  as  appropriate  and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

BDFC will establish a corporate planning group which will be headed by a senior \nmember of the management team and other relevant project officers, including a dedicated \nenvironmental  officer,  to  be  responsible  for  the  development  process  internally  and  for \ndesigning  and  implementing  the  EMS.  All  activities  related  to  the  environment  will  be \ncoordinated by the environmental officer in the project department of BDFC to ensure the \nsustainability of the EMS after the ongoing TA program implementation.  \n \nE.  Basic EMS at the Cost-Sharing Facility \n9.  The cost-sharing facility will adopt the same EMS as proposed in Section D. Additional \ndetail and modification of the EMS appropriate to the nature and scale of CSF operations (at the \nMSME division of the Ministry of Trade and Industry) will be studied and prepared during the \ntechnical support provided under subproject 3. \n \n ", "70  Appendix 8 \nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A8.1: Project Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($) \n \n    Financier \nGovernment/ \nItem  Total  ADB \nBDFC \nA.

Private sector development, with an emphasis on rural-based, micro, and small enterprises, \nwill specifically contribute to (i) new employment generation, especially off-farm employment opportunities in rural \nareas, and reduction of rural-urban migration; and (ii) absorbing the increased labor force due to the increase in the \nnumber of new graduates entering the job market. The Ninth Five-Year Plan estimates that, between 2005 and 2010, \napproximately 69,000 persons will enter the labor market, posing a challenge to the Government to urgently address \nthe employment issue, a situation aggravated by diminishing employment opportunities in the public sector and limited \nlabor productivity in the traditional agriculture sector. Therefore, support to the private sector, particularly MSMEs in \nagro-processing, food production, manufacturing, tourism, and nonfarm rural economic activities, becomes one of the \nGovernment\u2019s strategic focuses for further fostering economic growth and promoting equitable income distribution. \n \nThere are various development bottlenecks in the private and/or MSME sector, including a lack of enabling business \nenvironment, limited access to credit, deficient business development services (BDS), and an inadequate supporting \ninfrastructure. The MSME Sector Development Program (MSME SDP) therefore will provide support to strengthen the \npolicy and regulatory environment for doing business, improve access to credit, provide business support services, \nand enhance capacity building to help overcome constraints to private sector development. It is envisaged that gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth contributed by the private sector (measured by the share of GDP contributed by the \nmanufacturing, trade, and service-related sectors) will increase from 49% in 2005.2 \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Targeting Classification: General intervention \nThe MSME SDP is expected to foster an enabling policy and regulatory environment, eliminate structural barriers \nconstraining small enterprises\u2019 access to key resources, including credit and nonfinancial BDS, support private sector \nBDS providers market entrance, and provide capacity building to stakeholders for smooth project and program \nimplementation. The MSME SDP is essential for successful development of the MSME sector and cannot be \nimplemented as stand-alone measures. The outcomes and expected economic and social impacts of the program as a \nwhole which contribute to poverty reduction are as follows. \n \nEnabling Policy and Regulatory Environment. Policy actions proposed for developing an enabling policy and \nregulatory environment for MSMEs include establishing a coordinated policy and institutional framework for MSME \ndevelopment, and enhancing public governance and business regulations. These measures are expected to improve \ntargeted policies and programs, availability of comprehensive information for MSMEs, and heighten public awareness \nof the MSME sector. Cost for accessing such information on business regulations, and programs and services \navailable to MSMEs, will be set at a minimum for the private sector, and also will be affordable to the poor. In addition, \na simple and transparent regulatory regime will reduce the costs for self employment, establishing businesses, and \ncomplying with statutory rules and regulations, and in turn help accelerate the growth of the MSME sector and create \nnew employment opportunities, including for the poor. The proposed policy actions will also support good governance \nand further promote sustainable growth for overall poverty reduction. \n \nImproved Access to Finance. The proposed program measures for increasing MSMEs\u2019 access to finance include (i) \nprovision of a credit line to meet the shortage of funds available to MSMEs; and (ii) strengthening of institutional \ncapacity of the Bhutan Development Finance Corporation (BDFC) to enable effective channeling of funds to MSMEs. \nThe two components thereby are expected to stimulate growth within the private MSME sector in Bhutan, and the \nextension of the credit line to rural areas is expected to help ease regional and economic inequalities. Furthermore, \nenhanced institutional capability of BDFC and the introduction of cash-flow based lending will reduce collateral \nrequirements which can significantly improve access to financial services to MSMEs and also reduce transaction \ncosts, making financial services affordable for the poor.  \n \nEnhanced Competitiveness of Bhutanese MSMEs through Access to Qualified BDS. Proposed program policy \nactions and project components for enhancing competitiveness of Bhutanese MSMEs through strengthened BDS \ninclude (i) the establishment of a cost-sharing facility (CSF), and (ii) improving quality control and product standards. \n                                                 \n1  The Ninth Five-Year Plan has been extended by 1 year to cover the period 2002\u20132008. \n2  The data is the most recent available from the Royal Monetary Authority. Annual Report of Royal Monetary Authority \n2005/6. Thimphu. \n ", "Appendix 10  75 \n \nThe CSF aims to improve demand-driven access to BDS for MSMEs in order to increase their technical capacity and \noperational efficiency and further prevent increases in unemployment which may end in social unrest and increasing \npoverty. The cost-sharing scheme will allow micro and small enterprises to obtain access to key resources, including \nmarket information and technology, to develop and/or expand their businesses and therefore generate more income \nand employment opportunities, including for the poor.  \n \nGiven the current limitations on data collection, especially in the MSME sector, quantifying the potential impact of the \nproposed Program on the poor or the sector is extremely difficult. Therefore, the Program will closely monitor \noutcomes and collect program and project data and information throughout implementation to ensure that there is no \nadverse impact on poor and vulnerable groups. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?     Yes      No \nDiscussions will be held with the Ministry of Finance, Royal Monetary Authority, Ministry of Trade and Industry, \nMinistry of Agriculture, BDFC, and other stakeholders, including multilateral and bilateral organizations, such as the \nUnited Nations Development Programme and the Netherlands Development Organization. These will ensure the \nparticipation of stakeholders in proposing quality action plans and recommendations. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes      No \nThe implementation of the MSME SDP will be based on public-private collaborative processes. An MSME division, to \nbe established and mandated to coordinate and implement the MSME SDP, will consist of representatives from the \nconcerned ministries, industry associations, and the private sector. Capacity building will be integrated into the \nprogram and provided to key stakeholders. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: None. However, the Program will improve knowledge about female \nentrepreneurship and its socioeconomic role. Knowledge regarding constraints of businesses owned by women will \nbe  improved  by  proposed  policy  reforms,  enhanced  MSME  financing  through  BDFC,  and  better  business \ndevelopment services. \nHas an output been prepared?
