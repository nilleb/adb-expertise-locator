INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested knowledge and \nsupport technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to expand access to \nfinance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through financial technology (fintech) \ninnovations. The TA will assist the Research Department of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC). \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for the PRC.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Economic importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. As in most developed \nand developing countries, SMEs are an important segment of the economy in the PRC. They \ncontribute to economic growth, exports, tax revenues, and job creation. They generate about 60% \nof the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product and 50% of fiscal and tax revenue. They represent more \nthan 97% of total industrial enterprises and employ about 65% of the total workforce.2 Yet they \nfind it difficult to access finance. SMEs suffer from a lack of collateral that banks nearly always \nrequire before providing a loan because of the perceived high risk of lending to them. This \nultimately means that SMEs are burdened with a real lending rate of more than 15% per annum, \nmuch higher than the 3%\u20134% for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Moreover, SMEs tend to be \noffered only very short tenors of 1\u20132 years. This makes it impossible for them to obtain properly \nstructured loans for purposes such as capital investments. A lack of credit histories further \nimpedes their access to finance. \n \n3.  Inadequate fintech framework. Challenges also arise from the inadequacy of the current \nregulatory and legal context when it comes to the use of fintech by the finance sector, and from a \nsector-based financial supervision system. The financial system is overseen primarily by two \nregulatory  agencies (China  Banking  and Insurance  Regulatory  Commission  and  the  China \nSecurities Regulatory Commission), and the PBC. However, while their supervision fully covers \ncommercial banking and traditional financial institutions, much of the realm of fintech-related \nfinance providers remains outside their mandates. Hence, many emerging fintech platforms fall \nthrough regulatory gaps, and few guidelines or rules are in place to regulate fintech activities and \ntools. Fintech innovations play a key role in enhancing access to finance however, risks exist to \nthe end-user of these solutions. These risks must be managed yet, consideration should also be \ngiven to for the overall benefits of enhancing access to finance.  \n \n4.  Fintech-supporting regulatory tools not in place. While the PRC took steps to fill some \nregulatory gaps, these focused more on trying to control and remediate activities related to \ninternet finance. A so-called \"regulatory sandbox\" (an enclosed environment, supported by a \nregulator, in which fintech innovation can take place) is one element that can help enable financial \ninstitutions to experiment with innovative financial products and services in a live operating \n \nenvironment.\n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2019\u20132021. Manila. The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 October 2019. \n2  The definition of SMEs in the PRC is complex and involves a combination of (i) number of employees, (ii) industry, \n(iii) annual sales, and (iv) asset size. It stems from the 2003 Law on the Promotion of Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises. In general, medium-sized enterprises are those that employ 300\u20132,000 people, have annual sales of \nCNY30 million\u2013CNY300 million, and own assets worth CNY40 million\u2013CNY400 million. Companies with fewer than \n300 employees, less than CNY30 million in annual sales, and assets of less than CNY40 million are deemed small. \n ", "2 \n5.  Biased lending practices. Banks are the dominant source of funding for enterprises in \nthe country. State-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) control about 60% of banking assets and \nthey also dominate the deposit market. They show a preference for lending to larger businesses \nand SOEs, while neglecting the growing financial needs of SMEs. Overall, the credit risk tolerance \nis low when it comes to lending to SMEs, and the banks\u2019 risk incentive and risk assessment \nmechanisms are often biased, which results in credit officers being more interested in processing \nlarger-size loans to SOEs to more easily meet internal performance targets. Balanced incentive \nsystems are lacking.3 \n \n6.  Fintech  overly  focused  on  short-term lending  to  microenterprises. The  current \nfintech  environment  in the  PRC  is generally  more  supportive  of  individual  consumers  and \nmicrolending. The business segment represented by SMEs beyond the micro segment remains \nless well served, lacking the full benefits from fintech innovations. While nonbanking financial \ninstitutions and other financial portals are more favorable to lending to SMEs, impediments exist, \nsuch as limited funding capacity, restraints on capital, and higher levels of nonperforming loans. \nIn addition, credit risk assessment, credit methodologies, and credit delivery processes do not \nfully utilize fintech innovations. This is mainly true in the banking industry, which remains the \nlargest source of loan funds available to SMEs. While financial institutions that adopted fintech \ninnovations have had success in expanding access to credit and meeting the needs of various \nsegments, the full benefits of fintech have yet to be realized. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: inclusive development via access to finance \npromoted.4 The TA will have the following outcome: impediments for SMEs in access to finance \nreduced.5 This will be accomplished through the implementation of three outputs. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Recommendations on easing access to finance for small and medium-\nsized enterprises through the role of fintech created. The TA team will analyze the challenges \nthat SMEs face in accessing credit in the PRC, with an emphasis on the role of fintech. The \nanalysis will cover both the supply and demand sides of the financial market and explore the \nimpact of fintech innovations on credit pricing, credit reporting, and credit evaluation, focusing \nespecially on the practices of traditional stand-alone financial institutions and SOCBs. Surveys \nand roundtable discussions with SMEs will help obtain detailed information on their challenges in \naccessing credit. The TA team will also compile a list of international practices that successfully \novercame similar access hurdles for SMEs, and which could be applied in the PRC, with a focus \non fintech solutions. A national workshop to be held on fintech policy and innovations will help \ncreate a supportive framework. \n \n9.  Output 2: Policy recommendations for enhancing the regulatory fintech framework \nfor  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  created.  The  TA  team  will  assess  the  PRC\u2019s \nregulatory policy, supervisory, and institutional framework with regard to fintech and its potential \n                                                \n3  O.

Beijing. \n5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nrole in financing for SMEs. The assessment will include a desk review of earlier research and \nstudy reports in this field. The TA team will explore and recommend ways to effectively regulate \nand supervise fintech innovations in the PRC as they apply to access to finance for SMEs, and \nhow to mitigate the risks of technology innovation for the sector and the consumers of financial \nservices. The assessment will cover elements such as the use of bio-recognition in fintech, control \nof data use and protection against misuse, and finding the right balance between the rights of \nconsumers and the benefits for the overall finance sector from the commercialization of financial \ninnovations.  The  output  includes  a  workshop  for  policy  stakeholders  to  discuss  existing \napproaches to fintech-related regulatory policy, overlaps, gaps, and needs. It also includes a \nstudy tour to ADB member countries to explore first-hand some successful mechanisms for \nregulating fintech and its role in financing for SMEs. The TA team will prepare an ADB knowledge \nproduct on policy recommendations for outputs 1 and 2, to be distributed to counterparts, \nstakeholders, and industry groups. \n  \n10.  Output 3: Framework governing the use of fintech innovations to expand access to \ncredit developed. The TA team will assess the effectiveness of specific fintech innovations and \nmodels used in the PRC in supporting credit decision-making, risk management, and distribution. \nThe output will focus on the technological mechanisms that can be applied to financial institutions \nand nonbank financial institutions when lending to small and medium-sized business (excluding \nthe micro segment) to overcome impediments and biases. The TA team will conduct an inventory \nof existing fintech models for credit decision-making, risk management tools, and platforms for \ncredit provision and funding intermediation, and compare their strengths and weaknesses. It will \nevaluate the potential of using fintech to broaden SMEs\u2019 access to finance more fully within and \noutside the banking industry. The focus will be on new solutions such as using artificial intelligence, \nblockchains, natural language processing, and knowledge graphing. Use of fintech to improve the \ncredit decision-making and risk management processes will be evaluated. One purpose of the \noutput is to outline practical solutions that help remove the imprecision in current loan review \nprocesses and the human bias in decision-making. The TA team will test the rigor of commonly \nused model inputs and factors in the processing of credit for SMEs, identify elements of bias in \nlending to SMEs, and assess how technology solutions could help overcome such bias. It will \nstage an international conference to discuss the findings of outputs 2 and 3 and focus on fintech \nsolutions for SMEs\u2019 access to finance and the experience of the PRC. Finally, the team will \nprepare a knowledge product on the experience of the PRC in using fintech to develop SMEs\u2019 \naccess to finance that can be applied in other ADB member countries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013other  sources)  and  $200,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund6 and \nadministered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff; administrative and logistic support to perform surveys and organize and manage training \nevents, workshops, and conferences; access to data and required document sources; facilities \nfor key meetings between the implementing agency and consultants; printing and distribution of \nproject  material  to  PBC  staff;  assistance  in  coordinating  meetings  with  counterparts  and \nstakeholders; and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n \n                                                \n6  Financing partner: The Government of Luxembourg. \n ", "4 \nD.
