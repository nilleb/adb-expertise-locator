THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof  up  to  $100,000,000  to  Hatton  National  Bank  (HNB)  comprising  (i)  an  A-loan  of  up  to \n$75,000,000 and (ii) a B-loan of up to $25,000,000 for Supporting Infrastructure Development in \nSri Lanka. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Sri Lanka has achieved rapid rates of growth since the end of the civil war in 2009 (7.5% \non average from 2010 to 2013), with growth expected to be 7%\u20138% over the medium term. \nStrategic  challenges  for  this  middle-income  country  include  ensuring  inclusive  growth, \nincreasing the role of the private sector, strengthening economic development and integrating \npost-conflict areas, and managing government spending and bolstering revenues. Key drivers of \nthe economic growth include significant infrastructure investments and increased private sector \noutput, as well as higher private consumption as a result of increasing per capita income.  \n \n3.  Infrastructure  development  is  critical  to  ensuring  inclusive  growth  and  supporting \nrecovery in the post-conflict areas. The World Bank estimates Sri Lanka\u2019s annual investment \nneeds in infrastructure (excluding telecommunications) to be about $4 billion, or 4%\u20137% of \ngross domestic product (GDP), to support high GDP growth until 2024.1 With respect to post-\nconflict areas, many people have limited access to basic services that are readily available to \npeople living in other areas. The Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s 10-year policy framework for \neconomic development\u2014Mahinda Chintana: Vision for the Future\u2014was released in 2010 and \ntargets an 8% annual growth rate.2 The central theme of the Mahinda Chintana is that, following \nthe conflict, infrastructure will be critical in attracting investment for sustained high growth in the \nfuture. Key sectors for development have been highlighted as energy, solid waste management, \ntelecommunications, transport, and water and sanitation. \n \n4.  Investments in infrastructure are significant, and will need to be met by both the public \nand private sectors. Although decreasing, the country\u2019s budget deficit remained elevated at \n5.8% in 2013, mainly because the government did not raise fiscal revenues, particularly through \nmuch-needed tax reforms. Government revenues continued to contract from 17.3% of GDP in \n2006 to about 12.0% in 2013.3 This is among the lowest in the world, limiting the government\u2019s \nability  to  fund  social  and  economic  development.  The  government  now  relies  on  foreign \nborrowing,  which  funds  about  50%  of  its  fiscal  deficit.  Given  these  government  funding \nconstraints,  the  Mahinda  Chintana  notes  the  need  for  diversified  sources  of  funding  for \ninfrastructure projects. It also states that expanding private sector participation and introducing \npricing policies and efficiency gains are needed to generate more self-financing investments by \nstate enterprises, which is important to reducing reliance on debt financing. It notes that the \nfinance sector will be the catalyst for accelerated economic growth envisaged in the future. \n \n5.  In  line  with  the  government\u2019s  expectations  for  the  finance  sector\u2019s  pivotal  role  in \nsupporting economic development, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on 2 January 2014 \npublished its Road Map 2014, which was formulated with the aim of building a strong, dynamic, \n                                                \n1  World Bank. 2013.

IMF Country Report No. 14.285: Sri Lanka. Washington, DC. ", "2 \n \nand  internationally  competitive  finance  sector  with  cross-border  linkages  and  a  significant \noverseas presence. Sri Lanka has 33 banks, many of which are small, and this number is \ndisproportionate to its small population as well as the bank\u2013population ratio of other emerging \ncountries in Asia.4 However, the country\u2019s banking sector remains concentrated with six large \nsystemically important banks, including HNB. These six banks accounted for about 65% of \nsector assets at the end of 2013. The structure of the banking sector makes it more vulnerable \nto contagion risks while making it difficult for small banks to achieve economies of scale and \ndiversification. Just below half the assets of the banking sector are with the public sector. The \nmain objectives of CBSL\u2019s consolidation plan are (i) a larger aggregate capital base for the \nremaining institutions,5 (ii) increased potential to finance large-scale transactions, (iii) increased \ninvestments  by  foreign  investors,  (iv)  improved  levels  of  efficiency  and  profitability, \n(v) availability of a full range of financial services at affordable costs, and (vi) more effective \nsupervision. The consolidation plan is viewed as credit positive because it raises minimum \ncapital requirements and introduces a timeline for the introduction of Basel III standards for \nbanks, commencing in January 2015.6 In addition, CBSL has a target of five commercial banks \nreaching a total asset size of at least SLRs1 trillion. By increasing scale, these banks will be \nable to access international capital markets, which is challenging for the banks, and to provide \nlarge-scale funding needs for a high growth Sri Lankan economy. \n \n6.  ADB has been active in the finance sector since the conflict, providing much-needed \nlonger-term debt to banks to support housing finance and small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) onlending, as well as supporting trade finance through ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program.7 \nIn light of finance sector consolidation, ADB can play a significant role in the reform process and \nto support widening of access to finance, particularly in areas such as infrastructure finance. \nMany of the upcoming infrastructure projects are small, and some involve funding to provincial \nand quasi-government entities. As such, international financial institutions (IFIs) cannot fund \nthese projects on a direct basis. To address the financing gap for these small infrastructure \nprojects, ADB met with several banks to identify suitable financial institutions to support long-\nterm funding. HNB is the second largest private commercial bank and an established market \nleader in the microfinance, SMEs, and infrastructure financing segments with over two decades \nof experience in lending to infrastructure projects.8 HNB has an extensive network and promotes \ninclusive finance. It has been providing funding for infrastructure projects since 1975 and it is \none of the largest funders of renewable energy projects in Sri Lanka. HNB has maintained a \nrelationship  with  ADB  since  1990  as  a  lending  conduit  for  sovereign  loans  for  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment, infrastructure, SME, and agriculture targeted lending programs in Sri Lanka. It \nalso became a member of ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program in 2008. As such, HNB is a strong \ncandidate for long-term funding for infrastructure projects. This is ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign \n                                                \n4  The banking sector comprises 24 licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and nine licensed specialized banks. As of \nthe end of 2013, LCBs accounted for 48.7% of total financial system assets and 69.9% of banking sector assets. \nThe two largest LCBs and the largest licensed specialized bank are state-owned. \n5  The minimum capital requirement for commercial banks will increase from SLRs5 billion in 2014 to SLRs10 billion \nfrom 1 January 2016. A minimum total asset requirement of SLRs100 billion will also apply from 1 January 2016. \nFor nonbank financial institutions, the minimum capital requirement will increase from SLRs200 million or SLRs300 \nmillion in 2014 (depending on the classification) to SLRs1 billion from 1 January 2016, with a further increase to \nSLRs1.5 billion from 1 January 2018. \n6  Moody\u2019s. 2014.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Trade Finance \nFacilitation Program. Manila. \n8  HNB was awarded Bank of the Year 2013 in Sri Lanka for the second consecutive year by the United Kingdom-\nbased The Banker magazine, Best Managed Bank in Sri Lanka at the Asian Banker Summit 2013, and was rated \nthe sixth most valuable brand in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance Lanka (affiliated with Brand Finance UK) for 2013. \n ", "3 \n \nfinancial institution initiative targeting the infrastructure sector in Sri Lanka, and supports the \ncentral  theme  of  the  government\u2019s  policy  framework  for  economic  development,  while \ncomplementing previous initiatives that have targeted other sectors critical for economic growth \nsuch as SMEs, trade, and housing finance. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n7.  HNB commenced operations in 1888 as a specialized bank to cater to the tea industry. It \nhas evolved from a small local bank to the second largest private bank in the country. HNB has \nachieved this growth both organically and through acquisitions: it acquired Mercantile Bank in \n1974, the Sri Lanka unit of Emirates Bank International in 1989, and the Colombo branch of \nBanque Indosuez in 1996. HNB was incorporated as a limited liability and publically traded \ncommercial bank in 1970. Its ordinary shares and unsecured subordinated debt are listed on \nColombo Stock Exchange.9 \n \n8.  HNB provides services through its key business segments\u2014corporate, SMEs, personal \nbanking, development banking, and microfinance. It has the largest network of all private sector \nbanks (250 branches); and its wide outreach via ATMs, internet, and mobile banking channels \nhas  helped  build  its  strong  brand.  HNB  has  made  significant  investments  in  information \ntechnology and its service delivery platform, and considers this a core differentiating factor in \nterms of market positioning. It believes this will allow it to offer a greater number of services to \nits target market segments, as well as provide HNB with substantially greater outreach than its \ncompetitors, thereby achieving greater market penetration in the retail and SME segments. On \n1 October 2014, HNB signed an agreement to buy 51% of Prime Grameen Micro Finance. This \nacquisition, which is subject to regulatory approvals, will strengthen HNB\u2019s pioneering role in the \ndevelopment of rural Sri Lanka by expanding its microfinance operations. \n \n9.  Infrastructure finance. As noted, HNB has been active in infrastructure financing since \n1975. It established a project finance unit in 1982, and the team has built a strong track record \nand is financing a wide range of infrastructure opportunities in the public and private sectors. It \nhas  also  acted  as  a  participating  credit  institution  in  IFI  projects  targeting  infrastructure \ndevelopment. These include a World Bank Energy Services Delivery Project (1997\u20132002) and \nthe Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development Scheme (2003\u20132008), and the Post \nTsunami  Credit  Line  of  the  European  Investment  Bank.  Despite  HNB\u2019s  long  record  in \ninfrastructure financing, it has never reported a loss in this segment. HNB maintains sound \ncredit quality through careful selection of projects at the business development stage. The \nproject finance team has its own technical experts (including civil engineers) and HNB hires \nindependent experts to assess the technical risks for infrastructure projects. Credit management \nfor corporate borrowers, including infrastructure financing, is centralized at the head office. HNB \nmaintains  a  dedicated  infrastructure  credit  administration  cell  of  six  people  in  the  risk \nmanagement  team,  responsible  for  overseeing  progress  on  each  project,  including \ndisbursement, monitoring of work completed, stage releases, and reporting. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n9  All commercial banks in Sri Lanka, aside from the two large state-owned banks, are required to partially list their \nstock on Colombo Stock Exchange. \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n \n10.  HNB\u2019s two largest single shareholders are government entities\u2014Sri Lanka Insurance \nCorporation and the Employees Provident Fund. The remaining large shareholders are listed in \nTable 1 and are companies involved in trade, manufacturing, import\u2013export, and beverages.   \n \nTable 1: Hatton Nation Bank\u2019s Voting Shareholding Structurea \nShareholders  % of Shares Held \nSri Lanka Insurance Corporation  14.9 \nEmployees\u2019 Provident Fund  10.0 \nJayawardena familyb  18.2 \nCaptain family  8.3 \nSonetto Holdings Ltd.  4.6 \nFranklin Templeton  4.3 \nNational Savings Bank  2.9 \nOther investors (each holding <2.7%)  36.8 \n    Total  100.0 \na  Based on shareholdings on 30 June 2014. \nb  Jayawardena family shares are held through Milford Exports (8.1%), Stassen Exports (7.0%), and \nDistilleries Co. of Sri Lanka (3.1%). \nSource: Hatton National Bank. \n \n2.  Management \n \n11.  HNB has a strong management team. J. Alles, previously the chief operating officer, \nbecame chief executive officer (CEO) on 1 July 2013. The deputy general manager (risk and \ncredit quality) was then promoted to chief operating officer. Members of HNB\u2019s senior executive \nmanagement team have strong academic and professional backgrounds, most with extensive \nbanking experience in Sri Lanka and abroad. \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n \n12.  HNB has a sound governance structure. Its board consists of 10 directors, six of whom \nare considered independent. The former deputy governor of CBSL chairs the board. The CEO \nsits on the board as the only executive member. The board members have a well-balanced \nknowledge base spanning public finance, monetary policy, manufacturing, banking, investment, \nengineering, and accounting. According to the statutes of HNB, the maximum tenure for a board \nmember is 9 years (i.e., 3-year terms, with the possibility of being reelected three times) and no \nterm limits exist for the CEO. New board members are vetted by the nomination committee and \napproved by the board, with the consent of CBSL.10 \n \n                                                \n10 Sri Lanka was identified as a strategically deficient jurisdiction by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards in \nFebruary 2010. However, during 2013, FATF noted Sri Lanka\u2019s significant progress in improving its regime for \ncombatting money laundering and the financing of terrorism and Sri Lanka is therefore no longer subject to FATF\u2019s \nmonitoring process under its ongoing global compliance process for combatting money laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism. \n ", "5 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The ADB Assistance  \n13.  The assistance consists of a loan of up to $100 million comprising an A-loan of up to $75 \nmillion and a B-loan of up $25 million, with a tenor of up to 7 years. The loan will be used by \nHNB to onlend for infrastructure projects, including renewable energy projects. Pricing will be \nmarket-based. A portion of the risk on the A-loan may be transferred to counterparties that are \neligible under ADB\u2019s policies.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  HNB will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals and as \nrequested, including (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, (ii) audited financial \nstatements on an annual basis, (iii) compliance certificates for agreed-upon financial covenants, \n(iv) reporting on characteristics of the infrastructure loan portfolio, and (v) annual reporting on \nselected development indicators agreed between ADB and HNB. Annual reports on safeguards \nand social protection compliance will also be required. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance   \n15.  Supporting  banking  sector  reform.  The  Sri  Lankan  finance  sector  is  undergoing \nsignificant reform through a consolidation process, requiring banks to hold higher levels of \ncapital as it moves toward Basel III implementation in the coming years. CBSL has a target of \nfive commercial banks each reaching a total asset size of at least SLRs1 trillion to create \ninstitutions with enough scale to be able to access international capital markets, which is very \nchallenging and expensive for the banks. In addition to the two large state-owned banks, HNB is \nexpected to be one of the remaining three institutions in this bracket. By working with one of Sri \nLanka\u2019s leading private commercial banks through this process and providing long-term debt \nfinancing and balance sheet support, ADB has a unique opportunity to support reform and \npromote private sector participation in the Sri Lankan finance sector. CBSL considers that \ninstitutions such as ADB have an important role to play by working closely with the larger banks \nas they undertake reform. \n \n16.  Greater access to finance for infrastructure development. Following the end of the \ncivil war in 2009, HNB is seeking to play an active role in supporting national development \nthrough  the  provision  of  financing  support  for  infrastructure  development,  which  is  a  key \ndevelopment focus for the Government of Sri Lanka. HNB is one of the largest commercial bank \nlenders to infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka, particularly in the lesser developed provinces, \nincluding the Northern Province. The proposed assistance is expected to fill a much-needed gap \nfor long-term financing for infrastructure projects in the most underdeveloped regions of the \ncountry. The project is also expected to catalyze additional sources of long-term financing \nthrough potential B loan participation. \n \n17.  Adherence to market leading standards. ADB\u2019s engagement with HNB will play an \nimportant role in developing and supporting HNB\u2019s adherence to high corporate governance \nstandards,  as  well  as  the  adoption  of  market  leading  risk  management,  social,  and \nenvironmental  standards\u2014thereby  enhancing  risk  management,  environmental,  and  social \nresponsibility at one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest financial institutions. \n ", "6 \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impacts \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s financing to HNB is expected to contribute to two impacts. First, it  will help \nincrease access to finance for much-needed infrastructure development in Sri Lanka. Second, it \nwill contribute to increasing the level of private credit in the banking system. These impacts will \nbe reflected in (i) a rise in the ratio of private banking sector credit to GDP, and (ii) an increase \nin the share of infrastructure and construction loans to total banking sector loans. \n \n2.  Outcome \n19.  ADB\u2019s  funding  will  support  HNB\u2019s  infrastructure  portfolio  to  grow  sustainably.  Key \nperformance indicators include (i) growth in HNB\u2019s infrastructure portfolio, and (ii) maintenance \nof sound asset quality. \n \n3.  Outputs \n20.  The  outputs  of  the  project  are  (i)  increased  infrastructure  finance,  and  (ii)  an \nenvironmental and social safeguards system. The debt financing will result in HNB having \nadditional financial resources for infrastructure project development. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n21.  Finance sector development and infrastructure development are two of the five core \nspecializations  under  Strategy  202011 and  its  midterm  review  where  ADB  will  focus  its \noperations and best support its agenda.12 ADB aims to strengthen its support to the finance \nsector at the regional and national levels by helping develop financial infrastructure, institutions, \nand delivery of products and services to promote inclusive growth. Through such initiatives, \nADB will continue to assist in channeling funding into the most productive investments, as well \nas  continue  to  build  the  capacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best \npractices. The project supports institutional and finance sector development and the deepening \nof the finance sector by increasing the capacity of a sound commercial bank in Sri Lanka to \nexpand lending for infrastructure development projects. The proposal is, therefore, consistent \nwith Strategy 2020 and its midterm review. \n \n22.  The  proposed  project  is  directly  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  development  policy \nframework  for  2010\u20132016,  which  aims  to  accelerate  economic  growth,  improve  access  to \nfinance, address inadequate and poor quality of infrastructure as a major constraint to rapid \neconomic growth, and increase the low level of private sector investment. ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132016 \ncountry partnership strategy for Sri Lanka is built on the government\u2019s development policy \nframework  and  Strategy  2020,  and  calls  for  ADB  support  for  private  sector  development, \nincluding projects that accelerate the pace of private sector participation and promote finance \n \nsector development.13The project also supports inclusive and sustainable economic growth as \noutlined in the country partnership strategy, as the project will contribute to these objectives \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2008.

It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan to catalyze private investment and promote inclusive growth in Sri Lanka and to support \nfinance sector development through ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department.14 ADB has \nsupported the private finance sector since the conflict. It provided a $15 million senior loan to \nDFCC Vardhana Bank in 2012 to support housing finance and a $15 million senior loan to \nNations Trust Bank in 2013 to support SME finance in Sri Lanka. Eight Sri Lankan banks are \nactive in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program. The proposed project will build on ADB\u2019s work and \nsupport reform efforts in the finance sector. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE  \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n23.  The  project  is  classified  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. The  investment\u2019s  potential  environmental  and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with HNB\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio, and its commitment \nand capacity for environmental and social management have been assessed. HNB will not use \nthe ADB funding for onlending to infrastructure projects that are category A for impacts on the \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples.  Enhancements  have  been \nidentified to HNB\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS) for compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and the borrower commits to establish an updated \nESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement for the financing of infrastructure projects. HNB \nwill apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, ensure that investments abide by applicable \nnational laws and regulations, and comply with ADB requirements. The ESMS will include \narrangements to comply with national labor laws and ADB\u2019s  social protection strategy15 to \nensure  adherence  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  including  provisions \nprohibiting discrimination against women in hiring and providing equal pay for equal work for \nmen and women. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n24.  HNB was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n25.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n26.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),16 the Government of Sri Lanka will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to \nthe  proposed  assistance  to  HNB.
