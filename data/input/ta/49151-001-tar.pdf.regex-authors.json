INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identifies  private  sector \ndevelopment and private sector operations as drivers of change in Asia and the Pacific.1 Under \nStrategy 2020, ADB will expand work with the private sector to generate greater economic \ngrowth in the region. Public\u2013private partnership (PPP) is seen as an important modality to \nachieve this objective, and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 emphasizes the promotion of PPPs in all of \nADB\u2019s core operations. \n \n2.  The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) will directly contribute to \npillar 3 of ADB\u2019s Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020 by supporting ADB\u2019s \ntransaction advisory services (TAS).2 Following the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Public\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) was established in which ADB\u2019s TAS function is \ncentralized.3 Transaction advisory encompasses ADB providing transaction advice directly to its \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs),  including  specialized  support  and  advice  on  legal, \nfinancial,  technical,  and  other  matters  on  a  specific  transaction.  As  required,  specialist \nconsultants under this TA would support OPPP\u2019s TAS team. Concept clearance for this TA was \nreceived on 24 April 2015.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Support for Infrastructure Development \n \n3.  Southeast  Asia  and  the  Pacific  are  in  need  of  significant  infrastructure  investment, \nalthough several challenges exist: \n(i)  Traditional sources of infrastructure finance are strained; \n(ii)  Public  budgets  are  overstretched,  with  little  room  for  additional  spending  on \ninfrastructure.  \n(iii)  Debt markets are retreating as banks (particularly those in Europe), which used to \nplay a leading role in structured finance, are still recovering from the global financial \ncrisis and adjusting to tighter regulatory requirements, including Basel III.  \n(iv)  Multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and ADB, have limited \ncapital that is insufficient to meet the infrastructure needs of the region, estimated by \nADB at $8 trillion from 2010 to 2020. \n(v)  Overseas  development  assistance  has  played  a  relatively  modest  role,  having \nprovided only 2.5%\u20133.0% of total investments in infrastructure. \n(vi)  Developing country capital markets lack the depth and breadth to provide the kind of \nlong-term  financing  required  for  infrastructure  development  and  investment.  The \noutlook for traditional financing means that governments must consider alternative \nfinancing  models  to  leverage  private  capital  into  infrastructure  development  and \ninvestment. \n \n4.  Developing  countries  in  the  region  are  facing  a  huge  shortfall  in  infrastructure \ninvestment, which has negative consequences on economic growth. Measures are therefore \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2 ADB. 2012. Public-Private Partnership Operational Plan 2012-2020. Manila. (Pillar 3: Project Development \u2013 \nRegional Departments actively encourage PPPs and enhance DMC capacity to carry out project identification and \nsubsequent development.) \n3  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2015. \n ", "2   \nurgently needed to meet the additional funding requirements. Countries have three principal \noptions: (i) review traditional sources of public finance and explore additional funding from them, \n(ii) investigate mechanisms for generating more resources from off-budget sources, and (iii) \nconsider a greater role for PPPs as a way to procure infrastructure and identify and address \nimpediments to the development of PPP transactions. While the advantages of PPPs have long \nbeen recognized, many countries are still experiencing difficulties in their implementation. There \nis  a  need  to  increasingly  mobilize  and  better  coordinate  project  preparation  resources  to \ndevelop bankable PPP projects. In 2004-2014, fund managers around the world have raised \nnearly $300 billion from institutional investors specifically for infrastructure investment,  and the \nbulk  of  capital  in these funds  is from  long-term  investors  such  as  pension funds  and  life \ninsurance companies.  5 Infrastructure investments generally provide asset\u2013liability matching; \nstable, inflation-linked returns; and a relatively low risk profile compared with other equities. \n \nB.  Support for Public\u2013Private Partnership Development \n \n5.  PPP is viewed as a modality to serve the region\u2019s infrastructure financing needs by \nsupporting public spending with private sector capital flows. It is widely believed that a dearth of \nwell-structured, viable investment opportunities leads to a significant amount of capital in these \nprivate  funds  remaining  uninvested.  However,  there  is  ample  private  sector  capital  or \ncommercial debt available to finance well-prepared projects with a bankable risk profile. The \nreal problem is that during the cycle of infrastructure projects becoming infrastructure assets, \nthere is a gap in terms of (i) adequacy and quality of investment preparation, and (ii) early stage \ninvestment and development. \n \n6.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 (i) envisions ADB becoming a more active project \ndeveloper in addition to its established role as a project financier, and (ii) emphasizes the need \nto  provide  TAS to  advise  DMC  clients  on  developing  bankable  infrastructure  projects  and \nbringing private sector participation to those projects. As the central operational unit within ADB, \nOPPP provides TAS as a fee-based service; this allows OPPP to avoid crowding out private \nsector advisors by pricing its mandates in line with market norms. Through TAS, ADB seeks to \nhelp  developing  countries  deliver  modernized  and  efficient  infrastructure  services.  ADB\u2019s \nstrategic support promotes and supports PPP development in these countries, and addresses \nthe gap between public sources of funding and infrastructure needs. \n \n7.  Since its inception, OPPP has undertaken significant marketing efforts jointly with the \nsector  teams  of  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  and  resident  missions,  resulting  in  the \ndevelopment of a pipeline of possible PPP infrastructure transactions in Southeast Asia and the \nPacific for which OPPP would be able to provide TAS. While ADB\u2019s TAS teams will bring \ntogether specialists with commercial skills and sector expertise, ADB will need to retain external \nspecialists and consultants to support the TAS teams. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA will support the transaction advisory process which will aid project preparation \nand develop the capacity of DMCs for future PPP implementation. The TA will complement \nother assistance provided by ADB to strengthen the legal, policy, and institutional framework for \nPPP. For example, in the case of Pacific DMCs, OPPP will work with the Pacific Private Sector \nDevelopment Initiative on potential PPP projects, as it has done in the past. \n                                                \n5  Preqin  Global  Infrastructure  Report.  2015.  https://www.preqin.com/item/2015-preqin-global-infrastructure-\nreport/4/10606 \n ", "  3 \n \n \n9.  The TA will provide technical, legal, financial, negotiation, and other specialist support \n(insurance, tax advice, translator, data room management, and others) for TAS transactions in \nconducting due diligence, preparing documentation (including concession agreement and other \nagreements),  developing  financial  models  assisting  the  timely  completion  of  contract \nnegotiations, and performing other activities as required by the TAS process. The outputs will \nfocus on information needed by the DMC client to develop bankable PPP projects. Based on the \ninitial  size  and  term  of  the  TA,  it  is  expected  that  the  TA  can  support  one  to  two  TAS \ntransactions. \n \n10.  The expected structure of each TAS mandate ADB seeks to enter with its DMC clients \nwill result in the appointment of ADB as the lead or co-lead mandated advisor (in either such \ncapacity,  the  mandated  advisor)  for  the  specific  PPP  project.  In  turn,  ADB  will  engage \nconsultants on a project-by-project basis. The TAS mandate will require that the collective \nmandated advisory team owes an exclusive duty of care6 to the DMC client in ensuring that a \nbankable transaction is prepared. Each consultant and external expert, however, will provide its \noutputs directly to ADB in its capacity as the mandated advisor. Thus, each consultant, external \nexpert, and advisor hired under this TA by ADB will owe its exclusive duty of care to ADB as \nmandated advisor. While consultants and external experts will deliver outputs and owe a duty of \ncare to ADB, their support will be provided for the ultimate benefit of the DMC client. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impact  will  be  improved  and  increased  infrastructure  PPPs for  poorly  serviced \npopulations  in  DMCs.  Successful  PPP  transactions  that  are  supported  by  the  TA  will \ndemonstrate ADB\u2019s TAS capability and provide model cases for future projects. \n \n12.  The outcome will be an increase in successfully awarded PPP transactions, which will \nbe assessed by completion of contract negotiations and DMC client acknowledgement of a \nsigned concession agreement for projects that have TAS mandates. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n13.  The TA will provide technical, legal, financial, and negotiation support for OPPP\u2019s TAS \noperations. The outputs of the TA will take several forms, including technical studies, project \nagreements, legal support, financial analysis support, financial models, negotiation support, and \nother outputs produced by consultants hired under the TA. Not all TAS mandates will require \nthese items, but TA consultants will provide them as outputs, depending on relevant analysis \nconducted by ADB as mandated advisor. \n \n14.  The outputs of the TA are as follows: \n(i)  Technical studies. The studies will provide information needed to finalize the \ntechnical parameters of the project and project agreements, and address key \nobligations of the government under the agreements. Specific studies will be \ndetermined based on the underlying transaction. \n(ii)  Legal  support.  The  TA  will  assist  the  mandated  advisor  in  ensuring  that \n                                                \n6 Duty of care defines the reporting relationship, i.e. if a consultant has duty of care to ADB, it reports to ADB. \n ", "4   \nappropriate legal inputs (from both international law and local law perspectives) \nare identified and incorporated in the project agreements, and that the drafting \nand structure of the project agreements are consistent with best international \nstandards. Project agreements are expected to include a concession agreement \nand other supporting agreements as required by the particular project or sector. \n(iii)  Financial  analysis  support.  TAS  mandates  typically  will  require  several \nfinancial models throughout the course of the engagement, including a value-for-\nmoney  analysis,  a  financial  model  prepared  in  support  of  the  proposed \ntransaction  structure,  shadow  bid  models,  and  a  final  financial  model  that \nintegrates the risk positions and financial structure of the project agreed between \nthe government and the preferred bidder. In addition to development of these \nmodels, financial analysis support also includes review of the preferred bidder\u2019s \nfinancial model  and  other financial  analysis  tasks  as  may  be  required for a \ntransaction. \n(iv)  Negotiation support. The consultant team will support the mandated advisor in \nassisting and advising the government during negotiations with the bidder(s). \n(v)  Other supports as needed. In addition to the forms of support mentioned above, \nthe specifics of a transaction may require specialist inputs in areas including \ninsurance, tax, geology, environment, social safeguards, independent audit of \nfinancial models, and other specialist inputs a may be required for a transaction. \nThe TA may be called upon to provide these inputs as required by ADB as \nmandated advisor. Separately, the TA may also be used to retain consultants \nproviding  transaction  support  services,  including  translation,  data  room \nmanagement, and other forms of support. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,390,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. It is expected that the TA will be expanded with additional financing from \ndevelopment partners, based on the growth of OPPP\u2019s TAS business. ADB will discuss with \neach DMC client whether to reimburse ADB for costs incurred under TA if reimbursement by the \nDMC client is legally and administratively permissible under applicable law. If the DMC client \nagrees to reimburse ADB for its costs under the TA, ADB and the DMC will enter into a separate \nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will document the terms of the reimbursement \narrangements, including amount and timing of payments, and reflect the terms and conditions of \nthe relevant TA framework agreement and the TA letter between ADB and the DMC client. \nWhen there is no reimbursement arrangement, ADB will not recover its costs incurred under TA \nas part of fees payable under the terms of the TAS mandate. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  Executing and implementing agencies. ADB will be the executing agency and OPPP \nwill be the implementing agency. As part of every TAS mandate entered into by OPPP, it will \nseek the assistance of the DMC agencies managing the PPP process. Within ADB, OPPP will \nwork closely with regional departments to benefit from sector expertise and coordinate with \nvarious DMC agencies. OPPP will coordinate with relevant regional departments and resident \nmissions, as they have sector expertise, country knowledge and relationships, and a local \n ", "  5 \npresence. OPPP will also work and coordinate with ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel \nregarding any legal support provided by legal consultants. \n \n17.  Recipient  government  inputs.  Recipient  governments  are  expected  to  provide \ncounterpart staff, office space, and other support, as articulated in the TAS mandate between \nADB and the relevant government agency. Prior to entering into a TAS mandate, ADB will \nconsult with the government counterparty about use of this TA and other forms of support. \n \n18.  Monitoring and evaluation. The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the \nimplementation of activities and satisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline \nand  budget  allocation.  To  support  monitoring  and  evaluation  (and  when  commercially \npracticable), consultants will submit an inception report, quarterly progress notes, a midterm \nreport, a draft final report, and a final report to ADB. Because the provision of TAS will require \nOPPP to have frequent interactions with consultants hired under this TA, there will be regular \nmonitoring  of  overall  TA  progress,  assessment  of  performance,  and  confirmation  of  the \nrelevance of the TA. Any knowledge products created by the TA will be provided to the DMC \nclient  of  the  TAS  mandate  and  to  ADB  for  dissemination  to  the  government  and  other \nstakeholders, as appropriate and while respecting project confidentiality restrictions.7 \n \n19.  Engagement of consultants. ADB will engage international and national consultants, \nas  well  as  any  resource  persons  or  office  equipment  as  needed,  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). TA proceeds will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). Consultants are expected to be selected via quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures. Over time, OPPP also intends to create a short list of consulting \nfirms under an indefinite delivery contract so OPPP can engage them upon receiving mandates \nfor specific projects. Because of the lead time required for hiring consultants under the current \nguidelines, OPPP may also start recruiting consultants for a TAS mandate shortly before the \nmandate is officially signed. \n \n20.  Timing. The TA will be implemented from 15 June 2015 to 15 June 2018 on an as-\nneeded basis. Closing of the TA is anticipated by 31 December 2018. Further specifics on the \nTA scope will be determined as TAS mandates, which require this TA, are awarded to OPPP. At \nthe very least, OPPP signed its first mandate in May 2015, so further specifics on the TA scope \nfor the first mandate will be provided in the second quarter of 2015. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,390,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Enhancing  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Project  Development  through  Support  for  ADB \nTransaction Advisory Services in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.   \n                                                \n7  Through  TAS,  OPPP  is  providing  a  service  to  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  Thus,  TAS  mandates  will  typically  have  a \nconfidentiality clause that may restrict OPPP\u2019s ability to share information provided to a DMC client with certain \nparties outside or even inside ADB. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved and  International investors \nincreased  At least one additional  Government plans and  remain open to \ninfrastructure PPPs  PPP transaction in each  pipelines for PPP in  engagement in PPPs in \nfor poorly serviced  target country where  target countries  emerging markets \npopulations in DMCs  technical assistance is \nGovernment support for \nused   \nPPP in DMCs continues \n    Risks \nBudget constraints \nIncreased investment for  Government records and  prevent the pursuit of \ninfrastructure projects,  project information  additional PPPs \nmeasured by at least \nChange in government \n$100 million of foreign  Industry reporting \nresults in cancellation of \ninvestment or lending  sources such as Project \nprojects \ngenerated by PPPs  Finance International and \nsupported by this  other trade publications \ntechnical assistance \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncrease in  Completion of  DMC client  The government and \nsuccessfully awarded  negotiations for and  acknowledgement of  bidders remain \nPPP transactions  award of concession  signed concession  committed to the PPP \nagreement of at least two  agreement  tendering schedule \ntransactions by \nGovernment support for \nDecember 2018 \nPPP in DMCs continues \nRisk \nPolitical uncertainty \nslows decision making \nor completion of \ntransactions \nOutputs      Assumptions \nTechnical studies,  DMC client endorsement  DMC client  ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013\nproject agreements,  of consultant outputs  acknowledgement of  Private Partnership \nlegal support,  based on milestones  outputs and milestones  obtains mandates for at \nfinancial analysis  reached (see Activities  achieved  least two transactions \nsupport, financial  with Milestones) \nGovernment staff \nmodels, negotiation \nremain committed to \nsupport, and other \ndeveloping PPP as a \nsupports as required \nnew mode of service \nby transaction \ndelivery, and to building \nadvisory services \ntheir capacity for PPP \nmandates completed \nRisk \nModel PPP \nSuitable consultants \ntransaction structures \ncannot be identified in a \ndeveloped \ntimely manner \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.

A range of consultancy inputs could be obtained to support this technical assistance (TA) \nand  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Office  of  Public\u2013Private  Partnership\u2019s transaction \nadvisory services mandates. The following types of consultants are most likely to be hired, \nalthough others could be hired as well on a project-specific basis. The terms of reference are \nindicative and will be updated and modified as required for each project for which the Office of \nPublic\u2013Private  Partnership  receives  a  transaction  advisory  services  mandate.  Estimates  of \nperson-months are based on the TA being used for two projects. \n \n2.  Technical advisor (48 person-months). The technical advisor, which is expected to be a \nfirm, will have particular expertise that will vary based on the sector and country needs of the \nproject. However, certain tasks will be part of the advisor\u2019s terms of reference: \n \n(i)  conduct technical due diligence on the project prior to tendering; \n(ii)  develop feasibility studies and other relevant technical reports; \n(iii)  provide technical and commercial advice for the project; \n(iv)  consider safeguard requirements in relation to project layout, design, or projected \noperational characteristics; \n(v)  advise on all technical questions received from bidders and provide responses to \nbe issued by DMC client or the mandated advisor, as appropriate; \n(vi)  assist DMC client agency as instructed (subject to confirmation by the mandated \nadvisor) in conducting discussions with the bidder; \n(vii)  assist  the  mandated  advisor  and  the  legal  advisor  in  preparing  required \nmodifications to project agreements; \n(viii)  provide support, as necessary, for the negotiation process; \n(ix)  attend  to  any  other  matter  of  a  technical  nature  relating  to  the  project,  as \ninstructed by the mandated advisor; and \n(x)  attend to all other matters of a technical nature relating to the transaction for \nwhich ADB is the mandated advisor. \n \n3.  Legal advisor (72 person-months).
