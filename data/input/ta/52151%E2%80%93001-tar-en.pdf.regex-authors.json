INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to develop a legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for a \nprivate pension scheme.1 The private system will complement existing tiers in the public pension \nand social insurance system, which suffers from several weaknesses, including a lack of fiscal \nsustainability, and is unable to provide inclusive coverage. The knowledge and support TA aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020, and is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for Mongolia, 2018\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia has a need and the market demand for supplementary private pension benefits. \nThe current pay-as-you-go public pension system3 has a defined benefit scheme for people \nenrolled in 2015 notional defined contribution program and a nationally defined contribution \nscheme for older age groups who contributed before 2015. These two parallel contributory \npension schemes are complemented by (i) a noncontributory social welfare old-age benefit \nprogram, which had 1,871 beneficiaries who did not contribute or did not have the required years \nof qualification to access the contributory pension as of 2015; and (ii) a welfare cash support \nscheme for older people, which had 333,300 beneficiaries who contributed to the social insurance \nfund as of 2013.4 The pay-as-you-go public pension system covers only about half the labor force; \nefforts to reach agricultural workers, the self-employed, herdsmen, and the informal sector have \nachieved modest results. There are also persistent gender disparities and resulting vulnerabilities \nthat merit reforms in the pension system\u2019s design, which provides insufficient income to sustain \npreretirement  consumption  for  its  varied  membership. 5  It  is  estimated  that  the  income \nreplacement rate will fall to about 30% of average preretirement earnings for those born after \n1960. Financial projections for the public pension system indicate that even these modest income \nreplacement rates determined in accordance with the current law are not financially sustainable \nand require either a prospective decrease in benefits or parametric changes that would raise the \nretirement age. \n \n3.  A lower birth rate in the 1990s;6 rapid gross domestic product growth; and rapid growth of \nthe mining, manufacturing, and service industries in urban areas are expected to increase the \ndemand for private pensions. This demand will arise from pressures to (i) compensate for a likely \nnecessary increase in redistribution away from higher earners in the social insurance system, \nwhich will be required to sustain and improve the system\u2019s social inclusiveness; (ii) assist in \nmanaging a more competitive labor market in high value-added and high human capital industries; \nand (iii) provide early retirement for workers in hazardous or arduous industries, who may choose \nto set aside savings so that they do not need to continue working to the age when their accrued \nbenefits will be accessible in the public pension system. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 June 2018. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Ulaanbaatar: Swiss Development \nCooperation / Independent Research Institute Mongolia. \n6   The birth rate declined from 5.38 birth per woman in 1985 to 2.81 in 1995 due to the economic transition period when \nunemployment and poverty rates rose to unprecedented levels and abortion was legalized.   \n ", "2 \n4.  Banking and financial service employers are establishing employer-sponsored private \npension funds, which they view as a business opportunity to manage pension fund assets. \nHowever, these developments are taking place in the absence of a legal or regulatory framework \nand without specific economic incentives to positively distinguish supplementary pension savings \nfrom other types of private savings. Employer and employee representatives are aware of the \nneed for supplementary benefits and have taken steps to advocate for a better regulated system. \n \n5.  Mongolia\u2019s population has a high level of engagement with financial institutions and \nservices, particularly banks, and the level of financial knowledge and capability is similar to that \nfound in countries that have successfully implemented effective private pension systems. The \nunderlying need for supplementary pensions to fill projected gaps in the public system is a further \nindication of the potential for introducing private pensions in some form. \n \n6.  However,  Mongolia  currently  lacks  most  of  the  essential  legal  and  institutional \ninfrastructure needed to support a private pension system. Mongolia has no legal and regulatory \nframework specific to private pension funds. The Law of Mongolia on Securities Market (revised \nversion), 2013 and Law of Mongolia on Investment Fund, 2013 include key elements on the \ndivision of legal and beneficial ownership, prudential requirements for fund managers, and \nportfolio composition standards, but these needs to be further refined to meet the higher security \nstandards required for a secure and effective supplementary pension system. \n \n7.  There is no authority with the capacity or expertise to provide effective oversight of private \npension funds. The Financial Regulatory Commission of Mongolia and the Bank of Mongolia \ngained daunting new responsibilities under the recent legal amendments, including Central \nBanking Law (revised version), 2018 (para 6), and tighter fiscal situations.  Both are struggling to \nsecure adequate human and financial resources to deliver on their existing responsibilities. \n \n8.  The depth of capital markets and currently available products will significantly constrain \nthe ability to introduce private pensions. Capital markets tripled in size from 2007 to 2012, but \ntotal market capitalization remains relatively low in relation to the economy\u2019s size. The banking \nsystem continues to account for more than 95% of capital markets, with nonbank financial \ninstitutions providing only about 3% of total assets. There are almost no institutional investors\u2014\nsuch as mutual funds\u2014that could be expected to manage pension fund assets, and the insurance \nindustry remains highly concentrated in the property and casualty business, with few life insurance \nor other endowment products. The debt market is dominated by government issues that are not \nyet priced and sold in a transparent and liquid manner, or within the prudential standards required \nby pension funds. \n \n9.   The Law on Personal Income Tax (revised version), 2006, offers no financial incentives \nor other advantages to distinguish private pension funds from other forms of savings. This will \nmake it difficult to stimulate demand for private pensions beyond relatively narrow segments of \nthe labor force and employers facing the greatest worker retention pressures. \n \n10.  A complete, readily accessible system for consumer protection and redress does not exist. \nThe long-term nature of private pension savings, the vulnerability to poverty in old age that would \nresult from losses, and the disparity between the knowledge of the average consumer of pension \nproducts and the sellers, and managers of private pension funds require a robust system of \nconsumer protections and dispute resolution. \n \n11.  Consumer confidence in the integrity of a private pension and the long-term security of \nretirement  savings  is  paramount  to  the  success  of  any  system,  particularly  early  in  its \n ", "3 \ndevelopment. This can be achieved in part through effective regulation and supervision, but these \nare insufficient to ensure success. Supervisory authorities rarely have sufficient resources to \naddress individual cases and often face the competing imperatives of ensuring that individual \nbenefits are paid, and the long-term solvency of a pension fund is maintained. Public awareness \nof benefits arising from the private pension scheme is an essential requirement to ensure \nconfidence in, and the security of, any private pension system. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: more inclusive and sustainable development \nprocess promoted.7 The TA will have the following outcome: legal, regulatory, and institutional \narrangements for an improved pension system in Mongolia strengthened.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  The TA will support the development of the legal, policy, and institutional frameworks \nneeded to introduce a supplementary private pension scheme in Mongolia. The TA activities will \nbe implemented through legal, institutional, and policy advice; and capacity development. The TA \nwill also support the development of a communication strategy to ensure awareness of the \nproposed pension reforms among policy makers and the public. \n \n14.  Output 1: Legal and regulatory framework for the establishment of a private pension \nscheme developed. This will include developing a law on supplementary pension savings, which \nwill address the benefit structure, the method for payment of benefits, and the provision of \nmatching contributions for individuals not participating in the public social insurance system. In \naddition, it will include revising the Law on Personal Income Tax (revised version) 2017; the Labor \nCode (revised version) 2016; the Law of Mongolia on Investment Funds, 2013; and the Law of \nMongolia on Social Insurance (revised version), 2017. \n \n15.  Output 2: Institutional arrangements for systems operation and asset management \ndeveloped. These will include developing (i) a framework of standards for establishing, licensing, \noperating, and supervising employer-sponsored supplementary pension plans; (ii) standards\u2014to \ncontrol the investment portfolios, manage risks in the investment process, present results, and \ncredit individual accounts with investment returns\u2014that would apply to pension investment funds \nfor inclusion in the Law of Mongolia on Investment Fund; and (iii) a comprehensive prudential \nframework\u2014including  regulatory  oversight  and  redress  mechanisms\u2014that  would  apply  to \npension investment funds for inclusion in the new law on supplementary pension savings. \n \n16.  Output 3: Awareness of new pension arrangements among government officials, \nprivate sector stakeholders, and the public enhanced. Awareness raising is needed among \npolicy makers, private sector stakeholders, and the public about the rationale behind, and the \npotential benefits from, the establishment of a private pension scheme, especially to boost \nawareness of the existence of and need to address the system\u2019s persistent gender disparities \n(footnote 5). The TA will provide for the development and implementation of a communication \nstrategy and for training government officials and private sector stakeholders. \n \n                                                \n7  Government of Mongolia. 2016.
