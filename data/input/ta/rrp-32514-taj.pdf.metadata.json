The project area covers 5,080 square kilometers\n(km) south of the capital Dushanbe. The population of Khatlon\nRegion is approximately 2.1 million, comprising one third of\nthe country's population. Poverty incidence in the project area\nis  estimated  at  91  percent.  Economic  activity  in  Khatlon\nRegion is primarily agricultural with cotton, grains, fruits, and\nvegetables being the most important crops. The Project will\nimprove  the  transport  infrastructure  in  the  region  by\nrehabilitating  the  most  deteriorated  sections  of  the\nDushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  and  improving  rural  roads  in  the\narea.\nClassification Economic growth1\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B\nAn  initial  environment  examination  was  undertaken,  a\nsummary is attached.\nRationale The  improvement  of  road  transport  services  is  vital  for\neconomic development and poverty reduction in Tajikistan,\nwhich  is  the  poorest  of  the  Central  Asian  republics.  The\nbreakup of the former Soviet Union, civil conflict, and major\nnatural  disasters  have  resulted  in  a  dramatic  decline  of\neconomic activity and increase in poverty. Poverty incidence\nis currently estimated at 91 percent in the project area and 83\npercent in Tajikistan overall. Rehabilitation of the country\u2019s\nroad  infrastructure  is  necessary  to  sustain  the  economic\nrecovery now under way and to reduce poverty. Roads are\nthe most important mode of domestic freight and passenger\ntransport.  Maintenance of a good road network is vital for the\nagriculture  sector,  which  accounts  for  65  percent  of  total\nemployment  in  Tajikistan.  Roads  provide  the  sector  with\ncrucial access to markets for produce as well as sources of\ninputs,  and  the  rural  population  with  access  to  economic\nopportunities  and  social  services.  The  project  road  links\nTajikistan\u2019s  third  and  fourth  largest  cities  (Khulyab  and\nKurgan-Tyube) with Dushanbe, the capital and largest city.\nSince sections of the road were last rehabilitated in the 1970s\nand  are  deteriorating  due  to  inadequate  maintenance,\nrehabilitation is necessary to extend the road's useful life.\n                                                          \n1  Based on draft classification criteria to be applied as part of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy beginning in 2001, the\nProject would qualify as a core poverty intervention.", "iii\nObjectives and Scope The main objective of the Project is to enhance incomes and\nreduce poverty in Khatlon Region by improving road transport\ninfrastructure  and  thereby  supporting  the  creation  of\nproductive  employment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  (i)\nincrease  income  by  reducing  transport  costs  on  the\nDushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road;  (ii)  provide  agricultural  and\nindustrial  enterprises  with  improved  all-weather  access  to\nmarkets; (iii) improve access of the rural poor population to\nmarkets, other economic opportunities, and social services;\nand (iv) strengthen the Government\u2019s institutional capacity for\nefficient management of the national road network.

INTRODUCTION\n2. Tajikistan is a landlocked country bordering the Kyrgyz Republic, People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (PRC), Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan. Over 90 percent of the country is mountainous, and\nmost of its 6 million people live in the western part of the country. Tajikistan was one of the\npoorest republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU) upon gaining its independence in 1991.\nAlong with the breakup of the trade and payments system of the FSU, civil conflict and major\nnatural  disasters  since  independence  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic  decline  in  economic\nactivity and consequent increase in poverty. The unemployment rate is estimated at 30 percent,\nand  the  poverty  incidence  is  83  percent.1  The  Project  is  located  in  Khatlon  Region  in\nsouthwestern  Tajikistan  and  covers  an  area  of  5,080  square  kilometers  (km)  south  of\nDushanbe, the capital and largest city. The region has a population of 2.1 million, comprising\none third of the country's population, with a poverty incidence of 91 percent. Economic activity in\nKhatlon Region is primarily agricultural and includes the growing of cotton, grains, fruits, and\nvegetables, as well as raising of livestock. The region accounts for over 40 percent of the\ncountry's vegetable production, and many agricultural households cultivate fruits and vegetables\non small private plots for self-consumption and to sell in local markets.\n3. During the 2000 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the Republic of\nTajikistan  reconfirmed  its  request  for  ADB  assistance  to  rehabilitate  the  country\u2019s  priority\nnational roads and implement the Project. A project preparatory TA2 was provided to prepare a\ntransport sector profile and a road capital investment program, and to carry out the feasibility\nstudy  and  engineering  design  for  the  Project,  which  will  rehabilitate  the  most  deteriorated\nsections of the Dushanbe-Khulyab road (see Map) and improve rural roads. ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding\nand Appraisal missions3 (the Missions) visited Tajikistan from 9 to 22 February 2000 and from 2\nto 23 August 2000, respectively, and agreed on a prioritized investment program for the road\nsubsector and the project scope. Project design is based on the TA recommendations, findings\nof the Missions, discussions with the Government, beneficiary consultation, and coordination\nwith other assistance agencies. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n                                                          \n1 Based on the State Statistical Agency\u2019s poverty line of TJR20,000 per month.\n2  TA  3168 \u2013TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n3  The Missions comprised J. Miller, Project Economist and Mission Leader; S.Wu, Sr. Project Engineer; L. Campbell,\nSr.  Counsel;  K.  Motomura,  Programs  Officer;  F.  Agnello,  Poverty  Reduction  Specialist;  J.  Wartiovaara,\nEnvironmental Specialist; and S. Wendt, Social Development Specialist.", "2\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Transport\na. Role of Transport\n4. Transport plays a vital role in Tajikistan's trade flows and in the economy in general.\nTajikistan's  two  most  important  products  are  aluminum  and  cotton,  which  account  for\napproximately 60 percent of the total export value. Production of these goods is dependent on\ntransport for provision of inputs such as alumina and fertilizer, and for access to export markets.\nThe road, railway, and aviation subsectors carry out different transport functions. Roads are the\nprimary means of transport for domestic traffic. Railways are primarily used to ship transit traffic\nbetween regions of Uzbekistan separated by Tajikistan's Leninabad Region and also serve as\nthe main mode for the export of aluminum and cotton fiber. Civil aviation provides an important\nlink for passenger transport over mountain ranges, which divide the country and are impassable\nduring winter.\nb.  Traffic\n5. The  breakup  of  the  FSU,  civil  conflict,  and  major  natural  disasters\nseverely disrupted economic activities and customary trade patterns, and resulted in a dramatic\ndecline in transport demand after Tajikistan gained its independence in 1991 (Appendix 2). Total\nfreight tonnage declined by 92 percent from almost 300 million tons in 1990 to about 23 million\ntons in 1995. Similarly, total freight turnover in ton-km declined by 88 percent from 17.1 billion in\n1990 to 2.1 billion in 1997. The number of passengers declined by 60 percent from 264 million\nin 1992 to 105 million in 1997; passenger turnover declined by 73 percent from 4.5 billion\npassenger-km in 1992 to 1.2 billion in 1996. However, the formal end to civil conflict in 1997\narrested the negative trend, and Tajikistan has since made significant progress. The positive\neconomic growth of 1.7 percent in 1997, 5.3 percent in 1998, and 3.7 percent in 1999 is\nreflected in rising freight and passenger traffic, which still remains well below pre-independence\nlevels. By most measures, the size of the existing transport infrastructure is therefore adequate\nto accommodate the current and projected levels of economic activity and traffic in the medium\nterm.  The  most  urgent  need  is  to  prioritize  and  carry  out  the  rehabilitation  of  the  most\ndeteriorated segments of the national trunk road network to support economic recovery.\n6. Road  transport  is  the  most  important  mode  of  domestic  transport  in  Tajikistan,\naccounting for 67 percent of passenger turnover. Although road transport accounts only for 35\npercent of freight turnover compared with 65 percent for railway transport, 80 to 90 percent of\nrailway turnover is comprised of transit traffic crossing northern Tajikistan. Since the transport\ninfrastructure inherited from the FSU was designed to integrate the republics of the FSU rather\nthan to support the economic development of independent countries, railway traffic between the\nFergana Valley and other regions of Uzbekistan must cross the Leninabad Region in northern\nTajikistan. If such traffic and import freight traffic are excluded, road transport accounts for about\n98 percent of freight volume. The railway network consists of three unconnected east-west\nsections: (i) crossing the northern region of Leninabad, (ii) running westward from Dushanbe to\nthe border with Uzbekistan, and (iii) linking Khulyab and other major cities in Khatlon Region\nwith Ayvazh near the borders with Afghanistan and Uzbekistan in southwestern Tajikistan. Civil\naviation accounts for less than 1 percent of the total freight turnover and 25 percent of the", "3\npassenger  turnover.  The  high  percentage  of  passenger  turnover  is  attributable  to  aviation\nserving as the only link between some parts of Tajikistan when winter weather results in the\nclosure of roads. For example, aviation is the only link between Leninabad Region and the rest\nof Tajikistan for about six months of each year.\nc.  Transport Planning and Coordination\n7. Until recently, the Transport Department under the Office of the President acted as the\ncentral point of coordination for the transport sector. Development planning for the different\nsubsectors  was  the  responsibility  of  separate  government  organizations.  The  Ministry  of\nTransport  and  Roads  (MOTR)  served  as  the  national  agency  for  road  infrastructure\nmanagement, as well as management of road transport enterprises, including budget allocation,\nwork assignment, and personnel management. Tajik Railway Company served as the agency\nfor railways, and Tajikistan State Air Company for civil aviation and airports. Each of these\norganizations was responsible for preparation of development plans and investment programs\nfor  its  own  subsector.  During  implementation  of  the  development  plans,  the  Office  of  the\nPresident provided coordination for review and revision of the investment programs and for\nreallocation of investment funds among the subsectors.\n8. The Government\u2019s Transport Sector Policy Statement (TSPS), issued in 1998, outlines\nthe  policy  directive  requiring  development  to  be  based  on  market-oriented  reforms  and\nrestructuring to improve efficiency. Since transport reforms require strong coordination, the\nTSPS calls for the creation of a unified Ministry of Transport (MOT) overseeing the transport\nsector, with primary responsibility for formulating policies and regulations related to transport\nservices. The Transport Law, which was enacted by Parliament on 2 October 2000, provided for\nthe establishment of MOT. The Presidential Decrees formally establishing MOT and appointing\nthe Minister of Transport were issued on 25 October 2000.4\nd. Investments\n9. Public investment in transport dropped from about 5 percent of gross domestic product\n(GDP) in 1990 to less than 1 percent in 1998. Inadequate financing of the road subsector in\ncombination with damage from the civil conflict and major natural disasters led to serious\ndeterioration  of  the  physical  condition  of  the  road  network  as  well  as  institutional  and\nmanagement capacity in transport. Major reconstruction will soon be required for the national\ntrunk road network unless adequate funds are secured for rehabilitation and maintenance.\n10. The Government is currently operating under a national public investment program (PIP)\nfor 2000-2002, prepared on the basis of the country\u2019s fiscal capability and in consultation with\ndevelopment agencies for possible external financing. The PIP includes 41 projects with a total\ninvestment of $551 million equivalent. Seven of these are transport projects, including the\nproposed Project, accounting for about 21 percent of the total investment. The PIP, which was\napproved in October 2000, gives high priority to the Project. The Government confirms that\nadequate counterpart funds for the Project will be allocated in the state budget.\n                                                          \n4  As MOT is taking over the functions of MOTR, MOT will henceforth be used to refer to activities of both MOT and\nMOTR.", "4\n2.  Roads\na.  The Road Network\n11. The combined length of Tajikistan\u2019s road network is 26,000 km, consisting of 4,700 km\nof national roads and 21,300 km of local roads. The scope of the network is considered\nadequate  to  accommodate  existing  traffic  levels  and  support  economic  recovery  and\nsustainable development in the medium term. Most of the road network is paved, including\napproximately 90 percent of the national roads and almost 60 percent of the local roads. Of the\npaved roads, about 35 percent are asphalt concrete pavements with the remainder having only\na surface level of pavement. The major part of the network was constructed before 1970, and\ninadequate maintenance and damage from civil conflict and recent natural disasters have left it\nin a state of severe deterioration. MOT has classified 79 percent of the national roads as being\nin very poor condition, 20 percent in fair condition, and only 1 percent in good condition. This\nunderlines the need to rehabilitate the national roads to extend their useful life.\n12. MOT has jurisdiction over 13,600 km, including all of the national roads (4,700 km) and\n42 percent of the local roads (8,900 km). The remaining 12,400 km are mostly rural and farm\nroads outside MOT\u2019s responsibilities. Most of these were formerly under the jurisdiction of state\nand collective farms, while a few were under the jurisdiction of local governments. Following the\nbreakup of the state and collective farms, responsibility for maintenance of the rural and farm\nroads now rests with the local district administrations.\nb.  Road Standards and Safety\n13. Tajikistan\u2019s road standards and specifications are based on those of the FSU. Several\nstudies  have  indicated  that  the  design  standards  of  FSU  state  roads  (national  roads  in\nTajikistan) are sometimes higher than those of the United States or European countries but do\nnot always result in optimum road design. For lower-standard roads, FSU standards for design\nspeed and cross sections are similar to those used in developing countries, but for higher-\ncategory roads, they are excessive. The quality of construction of Tajikistan\u2019s roads is generally\ninadequate, mainly because of a lack of cost-effective construction techniques and independent\nconstruction  supervision.  Based  on  a  review  of  road  design  and  construction  standards\nundertaken under a regional TA5 for the three Central Asian republics (CARs) of Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan, as well as for Mongolia, standards suitable for expected\ntraffic trends in these countries were prepared. The TA findings and recommendations were\ndiscussed with the Government, which has agreed to adopt the recommended standards for\nproject design and construction.\n14. The Ministry of Internal Affairs maintains road traffic accident information collected by\nthe traffic police force; however, to date such information has not been made public. Limited\nroad safety statistics from annual surveys carried out by the Road Traffic Safety Section of MOT\nshow that traffic accidents decreased from 1995 to 1999. However, poor traffic management\nand  road  safety  facilities  were  observed  during  project  processing.  The  Government  is\ncommitted to improving traffic management and road safety facilities such as signs, signals, and\npavement markings, particularly in mountainous road sections.\n                                                          \n5  TA 5733-REG: A Review of Road Design and Construction Standards, for $600,000, approved on 3 April 1997.", "5\nc.  Vehicle Fleet and Traffic\n15. Recent traffic surveys on the national roads indicate average annual daily traffic on\nnonurban roads of 500\u20133,000 vehicles per day, with levels lower than 500 vehicles per day on\nsome sections. The civil conflict in Tajikistan and some neighboring countries has resulted in\nfrequent closures of Tajikistan's western, northern, and southern borders to most traffic, leaving\nthe remote eastern border with the PRC as the only fully open one. Traffic has also been\ncurtailed by the high cost and short supply of fuel, almost all of which is imported.\n16. In 1998, Tajikistan's vehicle fleet comprised 234,000 vehicles: cars 66 percent, trucks 27\npercent, buses 4 percent, and special vehicles 3 percent. Khatlon Region accounted for 21\npercent of Tajikistan\u2019s vehicle fleet. The 37 percent share of trucks of the vehicle fleet registered\nin Khatlon Region is substantially higher than the national average. Vehicles in Tajikistan are\nmostly old models manufactured in the FSU; many are not fully operational due to the lack of\nspare parts. The maintenance of vehicles and operational transport services is highly dependent\non and limited by the supply of spare parts from other CARs and the Russian Federation.\nd.  Road Transport Industry\n17. In 1998 the Government had jurisdiction over 81 road transport service enterprises,\nmainly regional trucking and bus companies, and owned about 80 percent of the trucks and\nbuses in the country. In 1999, the Government launched a privatization program to separate the\nprovision of transport services. Most transport service enterprises have been corporatized, and\nabout 30 percent of the state-owned vehicle fleet\u2019s trucks and buses have been sold. The bus\nfleet formerly controlled by MOT, with the exception of urban buses, is almost completely\nprivatized.  Less  progress  has  been  made  in  freight  transport.  MOT's  truck  fleet  is  in  a\ndilapidated condition, and approximately 80 percent is idle, either because the vehicles are\ninoperable or due to low demand.\n18. Tariffs for passenger and freight transport services are officially set by MOT. The tariffs\nfor urban, suburban, and intercity bus services were increased by 30 percent in 1999. However,\nsince the launching of the privatization program, most of the private road transport enterprises\nare setting their own tariffs. Information obtained in the project area during field visits indicates\nthat tariff levels are indeed flexible and changes in transport costs are passed on to consumers.\nFor example, in the past year, tariffs have fluctuated in response to changes in fuel prices.\nLiberalization of tariff regulations for road transport services is expected with implementation of\nthe new Transport Law, which prescribes commercialization of transport services.\ne.  Road Subsector Revenue and Expenditure\n19. The state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to\nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road\nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development\nagencies. The Road Fund had four main sources: (i) road\u2013user taxes, such as excise taxes on\npurchases of vehicles and parts, tires, fuel, and lubricants; (ii) charges on international transit\nshipments; (iii) vehicle inspection fees and registration fees; and (iv) contributions from local\ngovernments.    In  practice  only  half  of  the  Road  Fund  collection  was  allocated  to  road\nrehabilitation and maintenance. The other half was used for the construction of the Ushtur\nTunnel on the national road connecting Dushanbe with the northern region of Leninabad (a\nlong-term project requiring substantial expenditure) and for the construction of the railway line", "6\nfrom  Khulyab  to  Ayvazh  in  southwestern  Tajikistan.  As  a  result,  expenditures  on  road\nrehabilitation and maintenance, shown in Table 1, were much lower than what was needed to\nmaintain the road network at an acceptable level.\nTable 1: Expenditures on Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance\n($ million)\nItem 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\nAdministration 0.38 0.56 0.60 0.79 0.62\nMaintenance 2.12 2.61 2.01 4.96 4.89\nRepairs 0.00 0.00 0.21 0.90 0.00\nTotal 2.50 3.17 2.82 6.65 5.51\nSource: TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, Final Report Phase I, April 2000.\n20. In January 2000 the Government terminated the Road Fund to meet the International\nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  requirement  to  maintain  one  consolidated  state  budget.  Road\nmaintenance and construction are now funded from the general state budget. The combined\nbudget allocation for 2000 is TJR14 billion6 ($7.2 million), of which only 29 percent (TJR4 billion\nor $2.1 million) is for road rehabilitation and maintenance, and 71 percent (TJR10 billion or $5.1\nmillion)  is  for  new  construction,  including  the  Ushtur  Tunnel.  The  allocation  for  road\nrehabilitation and maintenance in 2000 is much below the 1999 expenditure and corresponds to\na funding level of only about $150 per km per year for roads under MOT's jurisdiction (13,600\nkm), or almost $450 per km per year for the national trunk roads (4,700 km), levels insufficient\nfor  even  minimal  maintenance  activities.  MOT  estimates  that  about  $150  million  per  year\n(equivalent to an average of about $11,000 per km) would be needed to rehabilitate and\nmaintain its road network in acceptable condition. However, the Government cannot afford this\nlevel of expenditure given its fiscal constraints. Until growth of the national economy generates\nadequate revenue, maintaining the road network will be a serious fiscal challenge and external\nfinancial assistance will be necessary to fund road rehabilitation and maintenance.\nf. Road Administration\n21. At present, MOT manages the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the\nnational road network, as well as some road passenger and freight transport services. MOT has\njurisdiction over 218 enterprises, primarily for road construction, road maintenance, and road\ntransport.7 MOT also maintains the Road Design Institute and administers equipment repair\nenterprises, road maintenance depots, and industrial enterprises producing concrete structures\nand  castings.  In  1998,  MOT  employed  25,000  staff,  including  engineers,  technicians,  and\nworkers.\n22. The administrative structure for the road subsector is undergoing significant change with\nthe  creation  of  a  unified  MOT  with  primary  responsibility  for  overseeing  transport  and\nformulating  policies  and  regulations  related  to  transport  services.  The  Government  has\nproposed  that  MOT  include  two  road  subsector  departments:  the  Road  Infrastructure\nDepartment (RID) and the Road Transport and Safety Department.8 The main responsibilities of\nRID will be (i) preparation of annual and five-year plans for road construction and maintenance,\n                                                          \n6 Tajikistan introduced the somoni as its new currency on 30 October 2000. However, the TJR will continue to be\naccepted as legal tender at least until April 2001. 1 somoni = TJR1,000.\n7  The enterprises consist of 68 joint-stock companies, 42 state corporations, and 108 state-owned enterprises.\n8  MOT will also include a railroad department and a civil aviation department.", "7\n(ii)  preparation  and  issuance  of  technical  design  standards  for  road  construction  and\nmaintenance, and (iii) preparation of technical standards for quality control and supervision. The\nmain responsibilities of the Road Transport and Safety Department will be (i) formulation of\nsubsector policies and regulations; (ii) issuance of licenses for road transport services; (iii)\ndevelopment  of  vehicle  technical  standards,  particularly  for  road  traffic  safety  and  the\nenvironment; and (iv) collection and processing of road transport data. Responsibility for design,\nconstruction, and operation and maintenance of road infrastructure will initially be retained by\nthe Government, but will eventually be contracted to the private sector once sufficient private\nsector capacity is developed. Market-oriented reforms for the transport sector are now being\nintroduced through implementation of the ADB-financed Postconflict Infrastructure Program9\n(PCIP), and a related advisory TA.10  The organization structure proposed for MOT under the\nTA is in Appendix 3.\ng. Construction and Maintenance\n23. Tajikistan has no effective maintenance planning and management system to prioritize\nroad maintenance, and procedures used for road maintenance are outdated and need to be\nupgraded to international standards. Road construction and maintenance activities on the roads\nunder MOT's jurisdiction are controlled by MOT, based on the road subsector management\nsystem inherited from the FSU. Local construction and maintenance contractors are not allowed\nto compete for work on the roads under MOT's jurisdiction. The maintenance of rural roads is\nthe responsibility of local governments, which may hire local contractors for maintenance and\nrehabilitation work.\n24. Approximately 100 road construction and maintenance enterprises remain under MOT's\nownership,  while  9  construction  companies  (accounting  for  40  percent  of  the  scope  of\nconstruction works undertaken) have been converted into joint stock companies. Most of MOT's\nroad  construction  and  maintenance  departments  are  organized  as  regional  conglomerates\nconsisting  of  specialized  technical  units,  except  for  those  in  one  region,  which  remain  as\nindividual  entities.  At  present,  MOT  has  limited  capacity  for  contract  administration  and\nconstruction  supervision,  and  still  follows  the  inherited  practice  of  directly  assigning  road\nconstruction and maintenance work to the regional conglomerates, which then assign the work\nto  specific  construction  enterprises  or  maintenance  depots.  The  overall  capacity  of  the\nconglomerates is limited because of inadequate expertise, obsolete equipment, and insufficient\nfinancial resources to perform contractual obligations. The staffing pattern for road maintenance\nis also inefficient with an excess of engineers at the supervisory level and too few maintenance\nworkers.\n25. The  Government  intends  to  privatize  road  construction  operations  by  devolving  all\nconstruction-related  activities,  personnel,  and  plant  from  MOT  to  independent  companies;\nhowever, road maintenance will continue to be MOT's responsibility. The Government supports\nADB\u2019s  recommendation  that  a  more  effective,  labor-intensive  road  maintenance  system\nfocusing on basic maintenance requirements and available financial resources be adopted to\nadequately maintain the roads to be rehabilitated under the Project. The terms of reference and\nscope of work of the ongoing road maintenance operations need to be redefined as well. The\nconsultants  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  2)  developed  a  road  maintenance\n                                                          \n9  Loan 1651-TAJ: Postconflict Infrastructure Program, for $20 million, approved on 10 December 1998.\n10TA 3114-TAJ: Institutional Strengthening of the Transport and Energy Sectors, for $1.5 million, approved on 10\nDecember 1998.", "8\nmanual to improve the road maintenance system. The Project will assist the Government in\nstrengthening the planning, management, and implementation of road maintenance through\nconsulting services under the advisory TA (paras. 69 to 72).\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n26. The Government's policies are currently in transition. Since the formal end to the civil\nconflict in 1997, the Government has been trying to improve delivery of various social services\nand  has  committed  to  maintaining  a  budget  allocation  of  37  percent  for  social  sector\nexpenditures. In March 2000, the Government launched the drafting of a poverty reduction\nstrategy paper with the World Bank and IMF, and created a special working group to begin work\non a national poverty reduction strategy. This working group includes leading academics and\nministerial representatives, and is scheduled to complete its assignment in the first quarter of\n2001. Based on the Government\u2019s request and on discussions with major stakeholders, ADB\nwill assist in drafting the national poverty reduction strategy and developing a poverty monitoring\nmechanism.\n27. The Government\u2019s transport strategy and development plans are reflected in the PIP\nand TSPS. The strategic objective is to establish an efficient transport system that provides\naffordable services to the nation, is responsive to the changes in the economy, and meets the\nneeds of the country through efficient allocation of scarce resources. The approach to achieve\nthe objective consists of (i) establishing a policy and regulatory environment conducive to the\noperation of a market-based transport system; (ii) improving sector management by limiting the\nGovernment\u2019s role to policymaking and sector regulation; (iii) improving corporate governance\nand encouraging private sector participation; (iv) establishing appropriate funding mechanisms\nand  adopting  market  pricing  and  user-pay  principles;  (v)  promoting  regional  intermodal\ntransport; (vi) improving safety and environmental standards; and (vii) recognizing the interests\nof disadvantaged groups and providing targeted support to them.\nC. External Assistance to the Subsector\n28. The major sources of external assistance to the road subsector are ADB, World Bank,\nIslamic Development Bank (IDB), Aga Khan Foundation, and Kuwait Fund. External assistance\nto the road subsector began in 1997, and the cumulative commitments totaled $22.8 million as\nof August 2000. External assistance has been limited to small-scale construction of missing\nlinks and emergency repair of roads and bridges destroyed by the civil conflict and natural\ndisasters. No major, direct support has been provided for road rehabilitation. The Mission\nconfirmed that the Project does not overlap with other assistance activities for roads.\n29. The first two loans by ADB to Tajikistan addressed transport needs. The PCIP (footnote\n9) and the related TA (footnote 10) have facilitated transport reforms in the areas of legislation,\nrestructuring of transport management, and enhancement of cost recovery mechanisms for road\noperation and maintenance. The more recent Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project11 includes\n$1.1 million for rehabilitation of small road sections and bridges.\n30. The World Bank has provided a total of $8.8 million for emergency repair of roads and\nbridges in war-torn areas as part of a larger credit in 1998 and a $5 million emergency flood\nrehabilitation credit in 1999. IDB committed $10 million in 2000 to finance construction of a road\n                                                          \n11Loan 1714-TAJ: Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, for $5 million, approved on 2 December 1999.", "9\nlink from Murgab to Kulma Pass on the border with the PRC in eastern Tajikistan. IDB and the\nKuwait Fund have provided a total of $1 million to construct the missing link of the Khulyab\u2013\nKalaikhum road and to carry out a feasibility study for upgrading the road. The Aga Khan\nFoundation provided $1.1 million during 1997-2000 to repair roads and bridges in the Gorno-\nBadakhshan Autonomous Region. Assistance agencies have been active in other transport\nareas as well. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development provided a $3.9 million\ngrant to rehabilitate the runway at the Dushanbe airport and a $5.0 million loan to rehabilitate\nthe Khujand airport. The European Union, IDB, and the Aga Khan Foundation have provided TA\ngrants totaling about $0.5 million for transport sector studies.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n31. ADB has no previous experience with large-scale projects in the transport sector in\nTajikistan. However, implementation of the PCIP, Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, and\nseveral TAs indicates that (i) absorptive capacity is limited because of the tight fiscal situation;\n(ii) the administrative structure is inefficient and has limited capacity for policy formulation and\nimplementation;  and  (iii)  knowledge  and  appreciation  of  ADB\u2019s  policies,  procedures,  and\npractices  is  limited.  To  address  these  difficulties,  the  Project  will  strengthen  Tajikistan\u2019s\nabsorptive and implementation capacity through consulting services under the advisory TA\n(paras. 69 to 72), which will familiarize senior Government officials with ADB\u2019s operational\npolicies and procedures, and provide on-the-job training and human resource development for\nthe Executing Agency. ADB has also drawn on the experience of other assistance agencies in\nimplementing programs and projects in Tajikistan. Their experience indicates that effective\nassistance requires project ownership and proactive involvement of senior Government officials\nin the process of decision making, a high level of commitment by staff, and adequate delegation\nof authority. The lessons learned from the experience of ADB and other agencies have been\nincorporated in the project design.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n32. The objectives of ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for Tajikistan are to facilitate the\ncountry\u2019s transition to a market economy, assist in postconflict rehabilitation and reconstruction,\nand provide support for natural disaster rehabilitation and prevention. The strategy focuses on\nthree priority areas: (i) agriculture and agroprocessing; (ii) infrastructure rehabilitation, especially\nfor roads and power; and (iii) education, health, and social protection. ADB\u2019s operations will\npromote development of small and medium-size enterprises and assist in reducing poverty,\nparticularly for households headed by women and communities in remote mountainous areas.\n33. ADB\u2019s strategy for the transport sector aims to promote growth by removing policy,\ninstitutional, financial, and physical impediments to the delivery of efficient transport services.\nThis will be achieved by supporting the Government\u2019s transport reform agenda and providing\nfinancial  resources  to  rehabilitate  the  rapidly  deteriorating  infrastructure.  ADB\u2019s  transport\nprogram for 2001\u20132003 will support the ongoing economic transition to a market economy by (i)\nhelping  the  Government  develop  an  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  framework  to  foster\neconomic  development,  (ii)  facilitating  privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises  to  improve\nefficiency, (iii) promoting competition and private sector participation in the provision of transport\nservices, (iv) improving cooperation with neighboring countries, (v) improving cost recovery\nmechanisms for road operation and maintenance, (vi) rehabilitating basic infrastructure, and (vii)\ndeveloping human resources.", "10\nF. Policy Dialogue\n34. The ongoing PCIP (footnote 9) includes a comprehensive agenda for transport policy\ndialogue and reforms. The policy reform and institutional restructuring initiatives include (i)\nintroducing an adequate sector legal framework, (ii) establishing a single policymaking body for\nthe entire sector to improve its management, and (iii) identifying and addressing institutional\nconstraints on human resource development. Although PCIP implementation experienced some\ndelays, by October 2000 the two transport-related core policy conditions for the second tranche\nrelease were met. A review of the present road financing and cost recovery mechanisms was\ncompleted in December 1999, and the Transport Law introducing market-oriented reforms in the\nsector was enacted on 2 October 2000.12 The Government\u2019s compliance with the transport-\nrelated core policy conditions provides the foundation for future transport sector reform, to which\nthe Government is committed. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue for the Project has built on the progress\nmade under the PCIP and focused on (i) facilitating implementation of the Transport Law, (ii)\nrevising the TSPS to reflect the latest reforms stipulated in the Transport Law, (iii) improving\ngovernance and sector management, and (iv) formulating strategies to enhance user charges\nfor  road  operation  and  maintenance.  A  summary  of  the  agreements  reached  with  the\nGovernment follows. An action plan for implementing the Transport Law, improving corporate\ngovernance, and addressing the social costs of the reform process is given in Appendix 4.\n1.  Policy and Regulatory Framework\n35. The reforms introduced by the Transport Law will need to be implemented through a set\nof regulations and guidelines. The main objectives are to (i) separate Government functions\nfrom those that can be performed by the private sector as commercial operations, (ii) promote\ncompetition and enhance private sector participation, (iii) privatize state-owned enterprises, and\n(iv) develop road safety and environmental standards that comply with international standards.\nThe implementing regulations and guidelines will be formulated with the assistance of the\nadvisory TA (paras. 69 to 72). The Government has agreed that the TSPS issued in 1998 will be\nreviewed and updated to reflect recent progress in policy reforms and sector development. The\nGovernment is expected to adopt the revised TSPS by the end of 2001.\n2.  Organization and Strengthening of MOT\n36. The Transport Law provides for the establishment of a unified MOT covering all transport\nsubsectors to improve the accountability and efficiency of management and operations in the\nsector (para. 22). Substantial work will be required to help MOT reach its envisioned capacity.\nThe advisory TA will assist in developing MOT\u2019s institutional capacity to effectively carry out its\npolicymaking  and  regulatory  responsibilities  in  a  market  environment,  monitor  policy  and\nprogram implementation, and conduct efficient program and project management.\n3.  Private Sector Development\n37. The TSPS emphasizes facilitating the privatization of road transport enterprises, and\nreplacing  the  current  road  management  system  in  which  the  Government  owns  the  road\nconstruction, maintenance, and transport enterprises (para. 21).  While some progress has\n                                                          \n12 Originally, the second tranche release under the PCIP was scheduled for December 1999, subject to compliance\nwith 11 core policy conditions (1 related to foreign investment, 2 to the transport sector, and 8 to the energy sector).\nThe delay has been mainly attributable to a series of elections in the first half of 2000 that slowed work by the\nexecutive and legislative branches of the Government.", "11\nbeen  made  in  corporatizing  and  privatizing  transport  service  enterprises,  substantial  work\nremains, and the process must be expanded to include road construction and maintenance\nenterprises. To facilitate progress, assistance will be needed to improve the legal framework,\ncorporate governance, commercial operation procedures, and accounting systems of the state-\nowned enterprises. A summary action plan for commercializing road subsector enterprises has\nbeen prepared under the PCIP-related TA (footnote 10). The Government has agreed that due\nattention and resources will be allocated to implement the action plan, and agreed to privatize at\nleast 25 percent of state-owned road transport enterprises by project completion. The advisory\nTA will facilitate commercialization and privatization of road transport enterprises, and help\ndevelop the capacity of the private sector to carry out road construction and maintenance.\n4. Counterpart Funds\n38. ADB has carried out policy dialogue with the Government on the provision of counterpart\nfunds for the Project and through this dialogue is helping the Government rationalize the budget.\nThe Government recognizes the importance of providing counterpart funds in a timely manner\nand will ensure that sufficient budget allocations are provided for the counterpart funds.\n5. User Charges and Financing of Road Maintenance\n39. Tajikistan  faces  major  problems  with  cost  recovery  in  the  road  subsector  and  with\nproviding  adequate  financing  for  road  maintenance.  Prior  to  2000,  road  maintenance  was\nfinanced in large part by revenues from the Road Fund (para 19). However, the Road Fund was\nterminated in January 2000, and the budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance\nfor 2000 is well below the 1999 expenditure (para. 20). The current allocation is too low to\nmaintain the road network at an acceptable level. In addition, the fact that budget allocations for\nroad  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  vary  substantially  from  year  to  year  makes  long-term\nplanning of maintenance difficult.\n40. Policy dialogue has been carried out with the Government on the need for adequate\nfunding of road maintenance, and ADB is continuing policy dialogue with the Government and\nIMF on reinstatement of the Road Fund. As both maintenance and construction are covered by\nthe same budget allocation, the Missions emphasized the need to give higher priority to road\nmaintenance than to construction of new roads and tunnels, which receives a substantial portion\nof the combined budget allocation. The Government has agreed to ensure that (i) the budget\nallocation for maintenance and rehabilitation, excluding new construction, of roads under MOT\u2019s\njurisdiction will increase by 10 percent per year in real terms during 2002\u20132004; (ii) funding for\nroad maintenance will comprise no less than 50 percent of the budget allocation for road\nmaintenance and construction in 2001, increasing to 70 percent in 2004; and (iii) sufficient\nbudget allocations are provided for maintenance of the Dushanbe-Khulyab road and rural roads\nincluded in the Project. To address the long-term funding of road maintenance, the advisory TA\nwill review the current road\u2013user charges and recommend more effective measures to increase\nroad revenue in order to recover the costs of operation and maintenance. The TA will also help\nthe  Government  prioritize  road  network  maintenance  and  optimize  utilization  of  scarce\nresources.", "12\n6. Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening\n41. The Government\u2019s institutional capacity for implementing policy reforms, particularly for\nimproving governance and management, is weak. Capacity building is urgently required at all\nlevels to improve administrative structures, procedures, technology, skills, and management.\nThis will be a long-term process and will involve defining new structures and procedures, and\nupdating technology and skills. ADB has assisted the Government through the PCIP-related TA\n(footnote 10) in the institutional strengthening of the transport and energy sectors, particularly in\nimproving the legal framework and restructuring sector management. The consultants identified\nthe following areas as requiring immediate attention: (i) project costing and financial accounting;\n(ii) project feasibility study methodology and technical design; (iii) project management and\nquality control; and (iv) road maintenance planning, financing, and administration. The advisory\nTA will identify specific measures to be implemented in these areas to strengthen institutional\ncapacity in economic and financial analysis and road maintenance financing (paras. 69 to 72).\nIn addition, the international consultants under the Project will help build capacity by helping the\nGovernment  identify  appropriate  international  training  programs  on  road  maintenance  and\nmanagement planning for MOT staff.\n7.  Poverty Reduction\n42. Poverty reduction is a key component of Government policy, and ADB is assisting the\nGovernment in drafting the national poverty reduction strategy and in developing a poverty\nmonitoring mechanism (para. 26). Policy dialogue for the Project emphasizes poverty reduction\nthrough the Government agreement (i) to include rural road rehabilitation in the Project and (ii)\non  selection  criteria  for  rural  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  (para.  50).  Reforms  facilitating\ncommercialization and privatization of transport enterprises (para. 37) will also help reduce\npoverty by ensuring that transport cost savings are passed on to transport users.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n43. The improvement of road transport services is vital for economic development and\npoverty reduction in Tajikistan, which is the poorest country among the CARs. The breakup of\nthe FSU, civil conflict, and major natural disasters have resulted in a dramatic decline of\neconomic activity and increase in poverty. Poverty incidence is currently estimated at 91 percent\nin the project area and 83 percent in Tajikistan overall. Rehabilitation of the country\u2019s road\ninfrastructure is necessary to sustain the economic recovery now under way and to reduce\npoverty. Roads are the most important mode of domestic freight and passenger transport.\nMaintenance of a good road network is vital for the agriculture sector, which accounts for 65\npercent of total employment in Tajikistan. Roads provide the agriculture sector with crucial\naccess to markets for produce as well as sources of inputs, and the rural population with access\nto economic opportunities and social services.\n44. The project road links Tajikistan\u2019s third and fourth largest cities (Khulyab and Kurgan\u2013\nTyube) with Dushanbe, the capital and largest city. The existing railway line in Khatlon Region\ndoes not link the project area to Dushanbe. Since large sections of the 250 km Dushanbe\u2013\nKhulyab road were last rehabilitated in the early 1970s and are in a deteriorated state due to\ninadequate maintenance, rehabilitation is necessary to extend the road's useful life.", "13\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n1.  Objectives\n45. The main objective of the Project is to enhance incomes and reduce poverty in Khatlon\nRegion by improving road transport infrastructure and thereby support the creation of productive\nemployment opportunities. The Project will (i) increase incomes by reducing transport costs on\nthe Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road; (ii) provide agricultural and industrial enterprises with improved\nall-weather  access  to  markets;  (iii)  improve  access  of  the  rural  poor  population  to  social\nservices, markets, and other economic opportunities; and (iv) strengthen the Government\u2019s\ninstitutional capacity for efficient management of the national road network.\n2.  Scope\n46. The scope of the Project includes\n(i)  rehabilitation of approximately 80 km of the most deteriorated sections of the\nDushanbe\u2013Khulyab road, in particular, repair and strengthening of embankment,\nbridges, protection structures, drainage facilities, and pavement;\n(ii)  improvement of approximately 150 km of rural roads including grading dirt road\nsurfaces, building appropriate drainage facilities, and surfacing some important\nsections with gravel;\n(iii)  procurement of appropriate equipment for road maintenance, laboratory and field\nmaterial testing, technical surveys, and design computerization;\n(iv)  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  contract  management,  and\ntraining needs assessment; and\n(v)  training in contract management, pavement management systems, and other\nareas critical for maintaining the rehabilitated road sections.\n47. If the Project is approved, an advisory TA for institutional and policy support to the road\nsubsector, including development of a road maintenance strategy and associated procedures,\nwill be provided.\nC.  Technical Justification\n48. The Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road was constructed in the 1950s and was last rehabilitated in\nthe early 1970s. Inadequate maintenance and severe weather conditions have resulted in\nserious deterioration and damage. In winter, heavy snowfalls and avalanches block the road. In\nspring and summer, melting snow and rainfall cause frequent rockfalls and landslides, which\noften make the road impassable. The road traverses several passes at elevations exceeding\n2,500 m and presents difficult driving conditions in its current deteriorated state. Rehabilitation\nof  the  road  is  urgently  required  to  prevent  irreversible  degradation.  The  rehabilitation  will\naddress the defects of the road infrastructure by repairing and strengthening the embankment,\nroad structures, drainage facilities, and pavement. The Project, which is ADB\u2019s first major\nintervention for rehabilitation of priority roads in Tajikistan, will ensure all-weather road transport\nservices on the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road.", "14\n49. Average annual daily traffic on most of the road sections ranges between 1,000 and\n3,000 vehicles at present. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the sections that\nwill be rehabilitated (Appendix 5). The forecasts cover 2001\u20132024 and are based on expected\ngrowth in GDP and population, and the income elasticity of demand for freight and passenger\ntransport. Some additional traffic is expected to be generated as a result of lower transport costs\narising from the Project.  The forecast average annual growth rates for total traffic are 6.6\npercent during 2001-2006 and 5.7 percent thereafter, resulting in traffic levels ranging from\n1,400 to 2,900 in 2001 and from 5,400 to 10,800 in 2024. The number of passenger vehicles is\nexpected to grow at a slightly higher rate than that of freight vehicles.\n50. The  rural  road  improvement  component  linked  to  the  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  will\ncomprise basic restoration of the roads, including dressing surfaces with gravel. The rural roads\nto be included in the Project will be identified by the consultants in accordance with agreed\nselection  criteria  focusing  on  poverty  and  social  considerations,  traffic  levels,  costs  and\neconomic returns, the road maintenance capability of the local governments, and links to other\nADB projects in the area (Appendix 6). Farmers in the project area and local health and\neducation officials will be consulted in the selection process.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n51. The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $26.8  million  equivalent  (including  physical\ncontingencies,  price  escalation,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  but\nexcluding taxes) 13, of which $18.6 million (69.4 percent) is the foreign exchange cost. The local\ncurrency costs are estimated at $8.2 million equivalent (30.6 percent). The cost estimates are\nsummarized in Table 2 and shown in Appendix 7.\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.  Base Costs\n1.  Civil Works\na.

The Government has given its assurance that\nif the amendment is not passed and any taxes are imposed, the Government will cover the cost of any such taxes.", "15\nE. Financing Plan\n52. The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan from its Special Funds resources\nin an amount equivalent to $20 million to finance the entire foreign exchange cost, except for\ninterest during construction charges on the OPEC Fund cofinancing, and $1.6 million equivalent\nof the local currency costs of the Project. The ADB loan represents 74.6 percent of the total\nproject cost. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years\nand an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter. ADB financing of a portion of local costs is justified due to the Government's\nbudgetary constraints, a heavy external debt burden, and Tajikistan's severe poverty. The\nbudget  deficit  was  4  percent  of  GDP  in  1999  despite  improvements  in  tax  collection  and\nconstraints on expenditure. Tajikistan's external debt is 97.2 percent of GDP, and its debt\nburden in 1999 was 3 percent of GDP. The current account deficit in 2000 is expected to be 5.7\npercent of GDP, and gross official reserves in October 2000 represent only 1.9 months of\nimports. The OPEC Fund will provide cofinancing equivalent to $4 million to finance the local\ncosts of the rehabilitation works on the Dushanbe-Khulyab road on a joint basis with ADB.  The\nOPEC Fund cofinancing will have a maturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years, an\ninterest rate of 1 percent per annum, and a service charge of 1 percent per annum. The\nGovernment will finance $0.2 million of foreign exchange costs for interest during construction\non the OPEC Fund cofinancing and $2.6 million equivalent of local currency costs, or 10.5\npercent of the total project cost. The Government has given its assurance that adequate local\ncounterpart funds will be made available from the state budget or other sources as necessary to\nenable the Project to be implemented in a timely manner. The proposed financing plan is\nsummarized in Table 3 and shown in Appendix 7.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent of\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Project Cost\nADB 18.4 1.6 20.0 74.6\nGovernment   0.2 2.6   2.8 10.5\nOPEC Fund   0.0 4.0   4.0 14.9\nTotal 18.6 8.2 26.8 100.0\nADB=Asian Development Bank, OPEC=Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nF. The Executing Agency\n53. As the Executing Agency, MOT will be responsible for overall project management\nincluding planning, managing, supervising, and coordinating implementation. Within MOT, RID\nwill  form  a  project  implementation  unit  to  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  project\nimplementation activities. RID has obtained relevant experience from implementing projects\nassisted by the World Bank and IDB, and by participating in the ADB-financed PCIP (footnote\n9). However, its capacities in financial accounting and contract administration are still weak and\nwill be strengthened through consulting services for construction supervision and training, and\nthrough the advisory TA.", "16\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Organization and Management\n54. An MOT deputy minister will be the project director with overall responsibility for project\nmanagement, including approval of contracts and payments. The project implementation unit\nwill  (i)  monitor  the  progress  of  day-to-day  project  implementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal\napplications,  (iii)  prepare  project  progress  reports,  and  (iv)  maintain  project  accounts  and\ncomplete loan financial records for auditing the Project. A project manager, acceptable to ADB,\nwith adequate experience will head the implementation unit and be responsible for supervision\nof specific implementation activities. The manager will be supported by a group of professional\nand  clerical  staff  with  expertise  and  experience  in  financial  accounting,  road  engineering,\nconstruction supervision, and contract administration.\n2.  Security and Safety of Project Implementation\n55. Tajikistan has suffered from civil conflict and political instability since independence,\nalthough the situation has improved recently. ADB concluded a special agreement with the\nUnited Nations (UN) in August 1999 to include ADB missions under the UN security umbrella.\nSince then, ADB\u2019s activities outside Dushanbe have been subject to UN security clearance. This\narrangement will remain valid for all ADB missions, consultants, and contractors under the\nProject.\n3. Implementation Schedule\n56. The Project will be implemented in slightly less than four years from January 2001 to\nSeptember 2004 including preconstruction activities. The civil works for the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab\nroad are scheduled to begin in October 2001 and be completed in September 2004. The rural\nroad improvement component will be implemented in one year from May 2002 to April 2003.\nThe implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8.\n4. Procurement\n57. All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in excess of $500,000 for goods and\nequipment  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts\nestimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will be procured through international\nshopping. Civil works for rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road have been packaged into\none  contract  and  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  to  encourage\nparticipation  of  international  contractors  and  joint  ventures  of  international  and  domestic\ncontractors.  Civil  works  under  the  rural  road  improvement  component  will  be  financed\ncompletely by the Government and will be procured under local competitive bidding procedures.\nTentative contract packages are listed in Appendix 9.\n5. Consulting Services\n58. International  consulting  services  totaling  75  person-months  will  be  required  for\nconstruction supervision (72 person-months), and project impact monitoring and evaluation (3\nperson-months).  The  international  consultants  will  also  provide  on-the-job  training  to  the\ncounterpart  staff  and  will  assist  MOT  in  the  identification  of  appropriate  overseas  training", "17\nprograms  in  road  maintenance  planning  and  management.  In  addition  to  the  international\nconsultants, domestic consulting services (810 person-months) will be provided for construction\nsupervision, contract management, and other advisory TA. An additional 15 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services will be required to assist the international consultants in monitoring\nthe social and poverty impacts of the Project through household surveys and data analysis. The\nGovernment  has  asked  that  the  internationally  recruited  consultants  collaborate  with  the\ndomestic consultants and ADB has agreed to this request. The consultants will be financed by\nADB and the Government and recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. The terms of reference for the consulting services are given in Appendix 10.\n6. Midterm Review\n59. ADB and the Government will carry out a midterm review of project implementation in\n2002.  The  review  will  focus  on  the  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical,\nenvironmental, social, and poverty reduction impacts of the Project. The Project\u2019s economic\nviability and other relevant aspects that may affect its performance will also be assessed during\nthe review. The review will examine the implementation progress for the sector reforms, policy\ndevelopment, and compliance with assurances specified in the Loan Agreement.\n7. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n60. MOT will prepare and submit to ADB and the OPEC Fund quarterly progress reports on\nproject implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed to by ADB. MOT will\nmaintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB, the OPEC Fund, and\nthe Government, and have them audited by an independent auditor with adequate knowledge of\nand experience with international accounting practices acceptable to ADB. The audited project\naccounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be furnished to ADB within nine months after the end of\neach fiscal year. The Government has been informed of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely\nsubmission of audited project accounts and financial statements, including the suspension of\ndisbursements in case of noncompliance. To facilitate project postevaluation, the Government\nhas agreed to provide ADB with a project completion report within three months of physical\ncompletion of the Project.\n8. Monitoring and Evaluation\n61. A set of indicators to evaluate project performance in relation to project goals, purposes,\noutputs,  and  conditions  has  been  agreed  with  the  Government,  as  shown  in  the  project\nperformance management system in Appendix 11. Baseline indicators and target values will be\nestablished by MOT when the rehabilitation commences. Subsequently, indicator values will be\nobserved  during  project  implementation,  at  project  completion,  one  year  after  project\ncompletion, and two years after project completion. The monitoring system will cover the social\nand poverty impacts of the road rehabilitation and improvement of the rural roads, and will\nprovide quantitative and qualitative analysis of the income levels of the rural poor, and the\ndistribution of project benefits to the poor. These aspects of the monitoring system will be\ncaptured through social and household surveys, public consultation, and participation of the\nproject beneficiaries. The Government has agreed to recruit an international consultant to help\nestablish the monitoring system, and to provide training in monitoring and evaluation to MOT\ncounterpart staff.", "18\n9. Anticorruption Measures\n62. ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  officials  of  the  Government  by  the\nMissions. ADB has helped Tajikistan improve governance and reduce the scope for corruption.\nADB\u2019s first intervention in Tajikistan, the PCIP (footnote 9), addressed a range of governance\nissues including reform of the legal framework and government structures, and improvement of\nefficiency  of  subsector  management.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  improve\ngovernance, ADB\u2019s 2001\u20132003 country assistance program includes four TAs to improve aid\nand debt management and build capacity for the legal system and corporate governance. ADB\nhelped prepare the bidding and contract documents for procurement of works and equipment,\nand recruitment of consultants based on the requirements and provisions of ADB\u2019s guidelines\nand in line with the anticorruption policy (footnote 2). The advisory TA will strengthen the\nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  detect  and  address  fraud  and  corruption  by  helping  (i)  formulate\nGovernment financial accounting standards and procedures, (ii) develop Government auditing\nprocedures, and (iii) implement a training program on project auditing to ensure full compliance\nwith the auditing procedures by Government auditors (paras. 69 to 72). The Government is\ncommitted to creating and sustaining a corruption-free environment, and has agreed to abide by\nthe relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy in preparing all documents and contracts\nduring the bidding process and during project implementation.\n10. Capacity Building and Human Resource Development\n63.  About 24 person-months of international training programs are included to develop MOT\nstaff capacity in the fields of bridge maintenance, pavement management systems, contract\nmanagement  and  quality  control,  and  maintenance  planning  and  equipment  depot\nmanagement.  In  addition,  the  construction  supervision  consultants  will  provide  on-the-job\ntraining for MOT staff and domestic consultants in subjects such as international standards and\nskills  for  laboratory  and  field  material  testing,  technical  surveys  and  design  standards,\nenvironmental  monitoring,  measurement  and  certification  of  works,  and  progress  reporting.\nMOT, with the assistance of the international consultants, will prepare for ADB\u2019s concurrence a\ntraining plan including a program of courses and lists of candidates to be trained. Workshops\nand seminars will be organized by those trained to disseminate what they have learned through\nthe training courses.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental Issues\n64. The  project  classification  is  Environment  Category  B.  An  initial  environmental\nexamination (IEE) of the Project was carried out under the project preparatory TA in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures,\nand Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The IEE indicates that there\nwill  be  no  major  adverse  environmental  impact  because  the  Project  involves  mainly\nrehabilitation of roads on the existing alignment (except for minor realignments to improve road\nsafety) and will not require any land acquisition.\n65. Appropriate mitigation measures have been incorporated in the project design, including\nadequate drainage facilities, erosion prevention measures, and traffic management facilities, as\nwell as planting of vegetation to protect the landscape and prevent landslides. The consultants\nfor construction supervision will assist MOT in supervising and monitoring the implementation of", "19\n(i)  selection  and  restoration  of  borrow  areas  and  quarries,  (ii)  extraction  of  water  for\nconstruction, (iii) waste management, (iv) control of chemical materials, and (v) prevention of\nimpairment  of  downstream  water  quality.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  it  will\nadequately address any adverse environmental impact of the Project. A summary IEE for the\nProject is included as Appendix 12.\n2.  Social Impact\n66. Tajikistan is the poorest country among the CARs, with a per capita GDP of $370 in\n199814 and poverty incidence of 83 percent. The project is located in Khatlon Region, which has\na poverty incidence of 91 percent. Agriculture is the dominant economic activity and the largest\nsource  of  income  and  employment.  The  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  traverses  seven  rayons\n(districts) with approximately 400,000 inhabitants, most of whom live within 20 km of the road.\nOf these inhabitants, 70 percent live in rural areas where the incidence of poverty is particularly\nsevere. The project design contains measures to extend socioeconomic benefits to the poor.\nThese  include  improvement  of  priority  rural  roads  to  facilitate  access  to  input  and  output\nmarkets for the rural population. The rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road will provide\nmore reliable transport linkages to the regional trade centers and bigger cities, where the\nfarmers and local producers can sell their products at higher prices than in local markets.\n67. Key social issues were analyzed during the social analysis conducted as part of the\nfeasibility study and developed during project processing missions. A summary social impact\nassessment is included in Appendix 13. The Project will have no resettlement effects. The\nProject will have no particular adverse impact on vulnerable groups and no negative implication\nfor gender concerns or indigenous people.\n68. The Project will contribute to reducing poverty in the project impact area and in Khatlon\nregion (paras. 75 to 81). The improvement of the Dushanbe-Khulyab road and associated rural\nroads will reduce transport costs, improve access to markets and social services, and reduce\ndamage to agricultural produce. The Project will generate short-term employment opportunities\nthrough the road rehabilitation itself, and also long-term employment through increased funding\nfor road maintenance. The Project's impacts, particularly those relating to poverty reduction,\nsocial development, and women, will be monitored during and after implementation. A set of\nbaseline indicators for monitoring project impacts was incorporated in the project performance\nmonitoring system (para. 61).\nI. Technical Assistance\n69. The Government\u2019s capacity to formulate market-oriented policy and regulations as well\nas  operational  guidelines  for  the  road  subsector  needs  considerable  strengthening.  The\ncapacity building should include defining new structures and procedures, introducing up-to-date\ntechnology and skills, and improving administrative accountability and efficiency. Under the\nADB-financed PCIP (footnote 9) and the associated TA (footnote 10), assistance was provided\nto the Government to improve the legal framework, restructure transport sector management,\nand identify critical institutional constraints that impede implementation of the Government\u2019s\npolicy  and  reform  initiatives.  To  facilitate  subsector  development  and  support  successful\n                                                          \n14 Per capita gross national product levels in 1998 in other CARs were $1,340 in Kazakhstan, $380 in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic, and $950 in Uzbekistan (World Bank. Atlas 2000. Washington, DC.)", "20\neconomic transition, the Government has requested ADB to provide TA focusing on institutional\ncapacity building and policy support to the road subsector. The advisory TA will assist the\nGovernment in developing capacity building strategies and implementing a capacity building\nprogram for the road subsector based on the findings and recommendations of the PCIP-related\nTA (footnote 10). It will also provide a vehicle to engage the Government in an in-depth review\nof the policy reform initiatives under the PCIP and help the Government with the appropriate\ntechnology and skills to efficiently manage development of the road subsector.\n70. The advisory TA will help the Government (i) update the TSPS to reflect the latest policy\nand reform development, and direct the implementation of new policies and reforms; (ii) prepare\nregulations and other administrative instruments necessary to successfully implement policies\nadopted  under  the  Transport  Law;  (iii)  develop  subsector  operation  and  management\nprocedures and guidelines; and (iv) introduce international standards and principles of road\nengineering  and  financial  and  economic  analysis.  The  TA  will  provide  hands-on  training\nprograms to the staff of MOT\u2019s road subsector management departments to strengthen their\ncapacity to implement these initiatives. Seminars, workshops, and briefing sessions will be\norganized  to  disseminate  the  TA\u2019s  policy  initiatives  to  managerial  and  technical  personnel\nconcerned with road subsector management. International training programs will be organized\nto expose senior government officials and management staff of MOT to up-to-date international\nstandards for economic and financial analysis and advanced public administration systems,\nincluding  practices  of  good  governance,  resource  mobilization,  and  constructive  legal\nframeworks for private sector participation.\n71. The TA will require 15 person-months of international consulting services and 10 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  with  expertise  in  public  administration,  legislative\ndrafting,  corporate  governance  and  management,  infrastructure  project  financing,  financial\naccounting,  and  human  resource  development.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at\n$600,000 equivalent including a foreign exchange cost of $457,000 and local currency cost of\n$143,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to provide $500,000 equivalent to\ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and local currency cost of $43,000 equivalent. The\nGovernment will finance the balance of the local currency cost of $100,000 equivalent. The TA\nwill  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nGovernment of Japan. The terms of reference for the TA and the cost estimates are provided in\nAppendix 14.\n72. As  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  MOT  will  be  responsible  for  its  day-to-day\nimplementation, including liaison and coordination with other Government entities. The TA will\nbe implemented over six months starting from July 2001. The consultants will be recruited in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Analysis\n73. The economic analysis of the Project is based on a comparison of the with- and without-\nproject scenarios. The principal sources of economic benefits for the Project are savings in\nvehicle operating costs, passenger time savings, and benefits arising from generated traffic.\nVehicle operating costs are calculated separately for each vehicle type comprising traffic on the\nroad sections; savings, which are attributable to the improved road surface, account for more", "21\nthan 85 percent of total benefits. The Project will also improve the access of the rural poor to\nmarkets and social services, and improve safety conditions on the road. However, as sufficient\ndata is not available to quantify these benefits, they have not been included in the analysis.\n74. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project, excluding the improvement\nof  rural  roads,  is  15.9  percent  (Appendix  15).  The  EIRRs  for  the  various  sections  of  the\nDushanbe-Khulyab road to be rehabilitated range from 14.2 percent to 25.4 percent. Distribution\nanalysis of the net economic benefits of the Project shows that vehicle owners and users of\npassenger and freight transport will be the recipients of such benefits, while the Government will\nhave a net economic cost. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative\nchanges in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The\nanalysis indicates that costs would have to increase by 35 percent and benefits decrease by 26\npercent to bring the EIRR down to the cutoff level of 12 percent. Given the simple nature of the\nrehabilitation works and ADB's experience with similar projects in other CARs, such changes\nare unlikely to occur.\nB. Impact on Poverty\n75. A  poverty  impact  assessment  (PIA)  comprising  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  poverty\nsituation in the project area and the impact of the Project on poverty was prepared (Appendix\n16).  During  project  processing,  poor  households,  farmers,  producers,  and  government\nauthorities from seven districts15 were visited and interviewed. Khatlon Region, which has the\nhighest population density in Tajikistan, suffered heavily from the civil conflict and major natural\ndisasters during the 1990s. The civil conflict resulted in the loss of about 50,000 lives, creating\nmany households headed by women and a large refugee population. The abatement of the civil\nstrife in the region and the country in general has been accompanied by the return of refugees,\nwhich  has  increased  the  incidence  of  poverty.  Khatlon  Region  is  the  second  poorest  of\nTajikistan's four regions in terms of individual per capita expenditures.16 At present, the average\nmonthly income per person for a typical rural household ranges from $2.5 to $4.5 equivalent,\nsubstantially  lower  than  the  national  average  for  rural  households  of  $12  equivalent.\nApproximately 91 percent of households in the region cannot afford the minimum consumption\nbasket and are living in poverty.17\n76. Agriculture and trade are the most important economic activities in the project area, with\nmanufacturing a distant third. Agriculture's importance in Khatlon Region has been increasing,\naccounting for about 40 percent of GDP and about 65 percent of employment in 1999. Surveys\nindicate that the small towns in the region rely on agriculture to a greater extent than small\ntowns in the country in general. Agriculture and trade are dependent on transport, and road\ntransport is by far the most important means of transport in the project area. Transport costs\nhave a large impact on farmers\u2019 incomes; surveys indicate that transport accounts for almost 20\npercent of the final market prices for their agricultural produce.\n77. The Project will reduce poverty in its area of influence by rehabilitating the Dushanbe\u2013\nKhulyab road, which will result in lower transport costs for shipments of agricultural products as\n                                                          \n15The districts are Bokhtar, Dangara, Kazamalik, Kazimalik, Khulyab, Leninsky, and Vose. The interviewed persons\nrepresent a population of about 400,000 in different types of communities, located within 20 km of the Dushanbe-\nKhulyab road and working in agriculture, industry, and other economic activities.\n16Republic of Tajikistan State Statistical Agency. 1999. Tajikistan Living Standards Survey. Dushanbe.\n17Based on the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s 1998 minimum consumption basket of TJR21,883 per\nperson per month.", "22\nwell as for passenger transport. Surveys conducted for the PIA confirm the strong linkage\nbetween  poverty  and  the  availability  of  reliable  road  transport  services,  indicating  that  60\npercent of the users of the road are poor. The road provides the primary link for agricultural\nproducers in the project area to larger markets, where they can receive higher prices for their\nproduce. In particular, the road links the rural parts of the project area to Khulyab and Kurgan-\nTyube (the third and fourth largest cities in the country) as well as to Dangara and other market\ncenters. It also links all parts of the project area with Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital and largest\ncity.\n78. The Project will reduce poverty by improving rural roads. Surveys conducted for the PIA\nindicate that poor farmers in the project area encounter three main transport-related problems\nthat reduce their incomes: (i) high cost of transport services, (ii) low availability of such services,\nand  (iii)  damage  to  agricultural  produce  caused  by  bad  road  conditions.  Improved  road\nconditions will allow a higher frequency of freight and passenger transport services along these\nroads. The higher frequency of transport services will reduce waiting times and thus encourage\nfarmers to take their goods to markets offering higher prices. It will also facilitate access of\nwholesale traders to rural areas to purchase produce; greater competition among traders will\nresult in farmers receiving higher prices for their produce. Improving the physical condition of\nthe rural roads will also reduce the loss of agricultural produce. In the PIA surveys, farmers\nstated that 15 percent of their profit on agricultural produce was lost due to damage caused by\nbad road conditions, with poor farmers indicating a loss of 20 percent.\n79. The policy reforms to be enacted by the Government as part of the Project will help\nreduce poverty by increasing the competitiveness of transport in the project area and the\ncountry as a whole. The Government has agreed to complete the commercialization of all\nGovernment-owned road transport operations, excluding large-scale urban operations, and to\nprivatize at least 25 percent of these operations by project completion. Commercialization will\ninclude the ending of mandatory tariffs for passenger and freight operations. These steps will\nensure that the market for freight and passenger transport services remains competitive and\nthat savings in transport costs are passed on to transport users.\n80. The  Project  will  have  other  poverty  reduction  effects.  The  rehabilitation  works  will\ngenerate 450 person-years of employment during implementation. About 80 permanent jobs will\nbe created for routine maintenance after project completion. Also, the Project will stimulate the\nlocal  construction  materials  industry  through  purchase  of  these  materials.  During  the\nconstruction  period,  the  poor  located  in  the  project  area  will  benefit  from  the  demand  for\nunskilled labor generated by the Project. Furthermore, as the economic recovery in Tajikistan\ncontinues, the improved access to urban areas will make new employment opportunities more\nreadily accessible to the rural poor. Finally, while access to health and education facilities is not\none of the most important problems confronting the poor in the project area, the rural poor do\nhave to travel to urban areas for advanced health and education facilities, and the improved\nroads will improve access to such facilities.\n81. A poverty impact ratio (PIR) was calculated for the Project. As the rural roads to be\nimproved will be identified after project inception, the PIR was only calculated for the Dushanbe-\nKhulyab road. The PIR, which indicates the proportion of benefits going directly to poor people,\nis estimated to be 62 percent. The PIR will increase significantly when rural roads are included,\nas the benefits from these roads accrue more directly to poor farmers. The PIR will increase as\nthe level of competition in transport increases. This illustrates the importance of enhancing", "23\ncompetition in the transport market not only to fuel economic growth but also to help reduce\npoverty. With higher competition in the transport market, drivers and vehicle owners will pass on\nmost of the transport cost savings to transport users in the form of lower fares and freight rates,\nthus lowering transport costs for the poor.\nC. Risks\n82. The Project is subject to the following risks: (i) delay in implementation, (ii) inadequate\ncapacity for implementation such as weak technical and managerial expertise, (iii) inadequate\nprovision of counterpart funds, (iv) poor construction quality, (v) inadequate maintenance of the\nrehabilitated roads, and (vi) unstable security situation. The Project has been formulated to\nreduce  these  potential  risks.  To  minimize  the  risk  of  implementation  delays,  the  project\npreparatory TA consultants prepared bidding documents to ensure timely commencement of the\nrehabilitation works. Given the country\u2019s limited absorptive capacity and resources, the Project\ninvolves the use of relatively simple technology to avoid major technical or managerial risks.\nMOT\u2019s capacity for project implementation will be strengthened though international consulting\nservices for construction supervision and the advisory TA. The use of international competitive\nbidding procedures and packaging the civil works for the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road into one\nintegrated contract will minimize logistical difficulties. To minimize the risk of poor quality control\nduring construction, the construction supervision consultants will assume overall responsibility\nfor  material  testing,  monitoring,  and  other  quality  control  measures.  Regarding  the  risk  of\npotential delays in project implementation from a shortage of counterpart funds, the country\u2019s\nabsorptive  capacity  has  been  reflected  in  the  project  scope  and  the  proposed  financing\narrangements,  and  policy  dialogue  has  been  carried  out  with  the  Government  to  ensure\nprovision of adequate funding. The risk of inadequate maintenance of the rehabilitated roads will\nbe addressed by procuring road maintenance equipment under the Project, developing the road\nmaintenance  manual  initiated  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  2),  including\nmaintenance in the capacity building and institutional strengthening components of the advisory\nTA, and providing international training in maintenance planning. The continued improvement in\nthe security situation, including successful presidential and parliamentary elections in 1999 and\n2000, will be a crucial factor for sustaining economic recovery. The project area was selected\nconsidering UN security classifications to ensure safety and successful implementation.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n83.

Estimates of current traffic levels are based on Ministry of Transport data and on moving\nobserver  counts  conducted  by  the  consultants  during  the  project  preparatory  technical\nassistance.1 Average annual daily traffic on the project road sections is estimated to range\nbetween 1,000\u20133,000 vehicles per day at the present time. Traffic was classified into seven\nvehicle types, including cars, pickups, buses, and four types of trucks. Cars comprise the\nmajority of traffic, accounting for 68 percent.\n2. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road sections for 2001\u2013\n2024 (Table A5). The forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP)\nand  population,  and  on  income  elasticities  of  demand  for  freight  and  passenger  vehicles.\nPopulation is expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 1.7 percent per year\nduring 2001\u20132006, and 2.0 percent during the remainder of the project period. GDP is forecast\nto  grow  at  annual  rates  of  4.5  percent  through  2006,  and  5.0  percent  thereafter.  Income\nelasticities of demand used for 2001\u20132006 are 1.8 for passengers and 2.0 for freight, while\nelasticities of 1.3 and 1.1 are used for passengers and freight respectively for the remainder of\nthe project period.\n3. Average annual growth rates for passenger and freight traffic are 6.6 percent during\n2001-2006. After 2006, passenger traffic is forecast to grow at a rate of 5.8 percent per year,\nwhile freight traffic is forecast to grow at 5.3 percent. Generated traffic resulting from lower\ntransport costs arising from the Project comprises a small proportion of total traffic. Traffic levels\non the project sections are forecast to range from 1,400\u20132,900 in 2001 to 5,400\u201310,800 in 2024.\n                                                \n1 TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.", " 38\nAppendix 5, page 2\nTable A5: Traffic Forecast for the Project\n(Average Annual Daily Traffic)\nLight Medium Heavy Articulated\nRoad Section and Year Car Pickup Bus Truck Truck Truck Truck Total\nDushanbe--Khazil-Kala\n2001 1,587 47 225 209 123 143 36 2,370\n2006 2,185 65 310 288 169 197 50 3,262\n2011 2,896 84 411 381 219 255 64 4,310\n2016 3,839 108 544 506 284 330 83 5,694\n2024 6,027 164 854 794 429 499 126 8,892\nKhazil-Kala--Kurgan-Tyube\n2001 1,817 48 415 250 135 171 43 2,879\n2006 2,501 66 571 344 186 235 59 3,963\n2011 3,316 86 757 456 241 305 77 5,237\n2016 4,395 111 1,004 605 311 395 99 6,920\n2024 6,901 167 1,576 949 471 596 150 10,811\nKurgan-Tyube--Dangara\n2001 965 35 103 103 87 118 29 1,440\n2006 1,328 48 142 142 120 162 40 1,982\n2011 1,761 62 188 188 155 210 52 2,616\n2016 2,334 81 249 249 201 272 67 3,453\n2024 3,665 122 391 391 303 412 101 5,385\nDangara--Gulistan\n2001 1,060 9 82 127 71 74 18 1,441\n2006 1,459 12 113 175 98 102 25 1,984\n2011 1,934 16 150 232 127 132 32 2,622\n2016 2,564 21 198 307 164 171 42 3,467\n2024 4,026 31 311 482 248 258 63 5,419\nGulistan--Khulyab\n2001 1,104 4 81 90 63 79 20 1,441\n2006 1,520 6 111 124 87 109 28 1,984\n2011 2,015 7 148 164 112 141 36 2,622\n2016 2,671 9 196 218 145 182 46 3,467\n2024 4,193 14 308 342 220 276 70 5,421", "39\n      Appendix 6\nSELECTION CRITERIA FOR RURAL ROADS\nItem Criteria\nGeographic Location \u2022  Within 50 km of the national road\nPoverty and Social Considerations \u2022  Roads providing access to markets for\nproducts of the poor\n\u2022  Roads providing access to social\nservices for poor communities\n\u2022  More densely populated rural areas,\nespecially those having a large number\nof farmers with less than 3 hectares of\nland per capita\nEconomic/Traffic Criteria \u2022  Minimum economic internal rate of\nreturn of 12 percent\n\u2022  Maximum cost per km of $10,000\n\u2022  Roads  with  vehicles  carrying  poor\npassengers  and  freight  produced  by\nthe poor.\nSustainability  \u2022  Ability  and  commitment  of  local\ngovernments to maintain the roads, in\nparticular  using  labor-intensive\nmaintenance schemes.\nCooperation \u2022  Link to Asian Development Bank rural\ncredit/agricultural rehabilitation project\nand/or other projects in the same area.", "COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($ million)\nCost Estimates Financing Plan\nFX LC Total OPEC Total\nItem Cost ADB Fund Government Cost\nFX LC LC FX LC\nA.

Introduction\n1. This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) report is primarily based on\ninformation contained in the initial environmental examination (IEE) report prepared under the\nproject preparatory TA.1 Additional information was obtained through a series of meetings with\ndomestic specialists, project planners, and designers, and through visits to the project area\nduring project processing missions. Direct observations improved understandings of the general\nproject setting and physical conditions of the surrounding environment. Some sections of the\ndescription of the environment, as well as background information, have been taken from the\nEnvironmental Profile of Tajikistan.2 The summary IEE draws information from the phase I draft\nfinal report submitted in December 1999 by the consultants (footnote 1), and was completed for\nthe rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road.  The improvement of the rural roads will\ncomprise minor works to existing roads and will not have a negative impact on the environment.\nB. Description of the Environment\n2. Located in the heart of the Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan covers a territory of 143,000\nsquare kilometers (km). Rugged, extreme relief characterizes the geography, with altitudes\nranging from 300 meters (m) to 7495 m above sea level. Main vegetative zones are desert,\nsteppe, mountain, and meadow. The population of Tajikistan in 1998 was 6.1 million, which was\nlarge considering that only 7 percent of the total territory is arable. Most of the population and\neconomic activities are concentrated in a few broad valleys. The most densely populated region\nis  Khatlon  Region  in  the  southwest  of  the  country,  followed  by  Leninabad  Region  in  the\nnorthwest, with 85.5 persons and 71.9 persons per square kilometer, respectively. A densely\npopulated  corridor  extends  from  Tursunzade  on  the  western  border,  eastward  through\nDushanbe,  and  further  to  the  northeast.    Eighty  percent  of  agricultural  lands  are  pasture.\nBetween pasture, reserve, and forested land uses, vast territories in Tajikistan are virtually\nuninhabited, reflecting the harsh physical environment. According to 1998 data, 14 percent of\nagricultural lands are cultivated, with two thirds of these intensively irrigated. The aesthetic and\nlandscape qualities are significant within the road sections to be rehabilitated under the Project.\nNo known archaeological sites exist along the road corridor.\n3. Water resources are abundant and Tajikistan\u2019s hydropower production is ranked among\nthe highest in the world. Tajikistan occupies only 6 percent of the land area of the Aral Sea\nbasin but supplies roughly 50 percent of the water flowing into the basin. However, water\nresources in the region are poorly managed, creating transboundary and internal quantity and\nquality problems.\n4. The  major  manifestations  of  environmental  degradation  in  Tajikistan  are  (i)  natural\ndisasters,  (ii)  land  degradation,  (iii)  limited  clean  drinking  water,  (iv)  low  levels  of  water\ntreatment, and (v) deterioration of wildlife and protected areas. In the past five years, water-\nrelated natural disasters, such as landslides, mudslides, and floods, have killed more than 200\npeople and caused damage estimated at several million dollars. Steep slopes and unstable soils\ncontribute to the 50,000 annual landslides. Soil erosion is also a significant issue in Tajikistan,\nprimarily as a by-product of intensive irrigation, flooding, wind, overgrazing, and loss of plant\n                                                          \n1 TA 3168-TAJ : Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n2  Asian Development Bank. 2000. Environmental Profile of Tajikistan (Draft Final Report), Manila.", "50\nAppendix 12, page 2\nand tree covers. Salinization of soil is also a major environmental concern, due to poor drainage\nof irrigated lands.\nC. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Environmental Problems Due to Project Location\n5. The  Project  will  not  have  any  negative  environmental  impact  on  archaeologically\nsignificant  sites,  nature  protection  areas,  or  other  culturally  important  sites.  Rehabilitation\nactivities will be confined to the existing right\u2013of\u2013way (ROW) of the road. No significant changes\nof  the  hydrological  characteristics  of  the  rehabilitation  sites  are  likely.  The  altered  road\nembankment,  borrow  pits  and  provisions  for  quarry  operations,  disposal  sites,  and  minor\nchanges in delineation to improve traffic safety will not require permanent land acquisition.\n6. Some land areas, in the vicinity of the rehabilitation sites, will be temporarily occupied by\nconstruction worker camps. Loss of property may arise, such as unauthorized tree felling for\nfuelwood, poaching of edible animals and birds of the locality in spite of prohibitions, and\ncreation of hazardous traffic flow due to lack of concern about local needs. To mitigate these\nimpacts, the contracts will contain specific provisions to avoid significant adverse impact due to\naltered embankments, borrow pits, and other activities. Borrowing of materials, as well as other\noperations outside the ROW, will be planned and carried out in accordance with agreements\nwhich will be made with the owners of the affected lands in advance and will include appropriate\ncompensation.\n7. In  some  of  the  road  sections,  landslides,  rockslides,  mudslides,  flooding,  or  soil\nsubsidence are a risk due to the location of the site. Those cases will be carefully recorded and\nappropriate mitigation measures included in the final detailed design of the rehabilitation works.\nErosion control of the embankments, pavements, and other road structures will be taken into\naccount everywhere in the project area, in accordance with the quality standards for the design\nand construction of the rehabilitation works.\n2. Environmental Problems Related to Design\n8. Appropriate  environmental  clearance  will  be  obtained  from  the  local  environmental\nofficials. The affected people will be invited to meetings at each site on the design of the\nrehabilitation works, to allow a participatory approach. Their views will be recorded and taken\ninto  account  as  much  as  possible.  Principles  for  compensation  of  losses,  as  well  as\nopportunities created by the rehabilitation works, will be presented. Local commercial activities\nwill likely be affected at some sites. On the other hand, new business opportunities, such as\nproviding services to workers, will become available.\n9. No significant negative environmental impacts related to the design are foreseen, as\nlong as the asphalt plants, camps, borrow pits, and disposal sites are appropriately located, and\nnational planning standards are appropriately followed. Special attention needs to be paid to the\ndesign  of  the  infrastructure  of  the  workers  camps  and  to  monitoring  their  water  supply,\nwastewater treatment, and sanitary conditions.\n3. Environmental Problems Associated with Construction\n10. Surface erosion and silt runoff may occur on the bare embankment and unprotected\nslopes during heavy rainfall. In flat terrain, the lost silt is expected to settle in the side ditches,", "51\nAppendix 12, page 3\nwhich are designed for surface water runoff where applicable. In erosion\u2013prone areas, the\ntiming of works is important. The embankment slopes will be planted with grass or otherwise\nprotected after the works have been completed. There are opportunities to upgrade the current\nlevel of erosion control (for instance, rehabilitation of roadside tree plantations).\n11. Contracts will require that asphalt and hot-mix plants be located at least 500 meters\naway from the nearest sensitive receptor, e.g., schools and hospitals. Asphalt will be purchased\nfrom  permanent  factories.  Operators  will  be  required  to  install  emission  controls  where\napplicable. Trucks carrying earth, sand, or stone will be covered with tarps to avoid spilling.\nCare will be taken during the construction period to ensure that traffic disruptions to road\ntransport are minimized. Detailed temporary arrangements are to be addressed in the context of\ndetailed design and implementation planning of the rehabilitation works.\n12. To ensure contractors\u2019 compliance with the environmental regulations and standards,\nregular  inspections  by  the  MOT  environmental  staff  and  local  government  units  will  be\nundertaken. Their findings will be attached to the weekly and monthly progress reports, with\ncomments on the possible response to emerging environmental concerns. The inspections will\ncover all relevant issues, for instance the use of appropriate materials, and include possible\nclaims made by the affected people.\n4. Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations\n13. The planned road rehabilitation activities will increase traffic levels. The effect on air\nquality  and  noise  levels  is  considered  minor,  and  no  particular  mitigation  measures  are\nrecommended.  Road  safety  is  expected  to  improve  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  Possible\nsecondary  benefits  include  reduction  of  car  accidents  and  reduced  spills  of  hazardous\nchemicals transported by trucks.\nD. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n14. Environmental  monitoring  of  the  Project  will  be  conducted  by  MOT,  the  Executing\nAgency.  MOT will ensure that tender documents and contracts for the Project incorporate\nenvironmental mitigation measures. MOT  will  supervise  the  consultants  through  weekly\ninspection  visits  to  the  sites  (visual  observations  and  communications)  and  preparation  of\nmonthly reports. Institutional requirements for the Project include appropriate environmental\nclearance  by  the  Government  and  local  government.    Environmental  monitoring  will  pay\nparticular attention to embankment and erosion prevention requirements, borrow pit restoration\nrequirements, mining and quarry activities, siting of construction camps and related facilities,\nsiting of asphalt plants, community relations, and safety provisions.\nE. Findings and Recommendations\n15. Environmental issues that need to be addressed during implementation of the Project\ninclude the following:\n(i)  Appropriate environmental clearance and permits will be obtained from Ministry\nof Environmental Protection and other concerned national agencies in Tajikistan.\nNational laws and guidelines will be followed as appropriate.\n(ii)  Institutional  capacity  of  MOT  and  other  relevant  agencies  needs  to  be\nstrengthened to address the environmental issues from ADB\u2013financed projects.\nAs road transport is one of the focal development areas identified by ADB for the", "52\nAppendix 12, page 4\ndevelopment of Tajikistan, the environment is recommended as one integrated\nfield of institutional strengthening.\n(iii)  According to the IEE, all negative impacts resulting from the proposed road\nrehabilitation project can be mitigated to an acceptable level.\n(iv)  Environmental  management  will  be  made  an  integrated  part  of  project\nmanagement.  Environmental  monitoring  reports,  based  on  weekly  inspection\nvisits, will be submitted together with other project progress reports.\n(v)  The proposed environmental mitigation measures, as identified in the IEE report,\nwill be included in the construction contracts.\n(vi)  Preparation of brief erosion control guidelines is recommended for the Project.\nF. Conclusion\n16. According  to  the  environmental  assessment  studies,  the  negative  environmental\nconsequences resulting from the Project can be mitigated to an acceptable level.", "53\nAppendix 13, page 1\nSUMMARY SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nA.  Introduction\n1. This summary social impact assessment (SIA) is primarily based on information contained\nin the social assessment prepared on behalf of the Ministry of Transport by the project preparatory\ntechnical assistance (TA) consultants.1 Additional information was obtained through analysis of\nofficial statistics, meetings with government specialists and project planners, and through site visits\nto the project area during project processing missions. A separate poverty impact assessment was\nprepared, and the summary poverty impact assessment is included in Appendix 16.\nB.  Description of the Project Area\n2. Tajikistan is among the 20 poorest countries in the world. Eighty\u2013three percent of the\npopulation  lives  below  the  poverty  line,  an  increase  from  about  33  percent  at  the  time  of\nindependence in 1991. The major ethnic groups in Tajikistan are Tajiks (65 percent), Uzbeks (25\npercent), and Russians, including Russian-speaking nationalities (3.5 percent). The remaining\npopulation comprises Tatars, Kyrgyz, and Ukrainians. The major languages spoken are Tajik,\nRussian, Pamiri dialects, and Sogdian. Although Tajikistan is a secular state, 80 percent of the\npopulation are Moslem (mostly Sunni), and the rest belong to Ismailsm (a sect of Shia Islam) and\nthe Russian Orthodox Church.\n3. The majority of Tajikistan\u2019s population resides in the western part of the country. According\nto  the  official  census,  220,000  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  6.1  million  people  live  in  the  eastern  Gorno-\nBadakhshan Autonomous Region, a territory that makes up almost half of the area of the country.\nApproximately 1.5 million people live in Tajikistan\u2019s urban centers. The majority of the population of\nTajikistan (72 percent) lives in a total of 3,200 small rural settlements, ranging from 100 to 1,000\npeople.\n4. The project area covers 5,080 square kilometers (km) from Dushanbe to Khulyab through\nKurgan-Tyube and Dangara, all located in the Khatlon Region in southwestern Tajikistan. The\nProject will focus on rehabilitation of about 80 km of the most seriously damaged road sections,\nrehabilitation of about 150 km of rural roads, and assisting the Government in developing a road\nmaintenance  system  in  the  project  area.  The  road  traverses  the  following  districts:  Bokhtar,\nDangara, Kazamalik, Kazimalik, Khulyab, Leninsky, and Vose with a population of 71,348 in\nKazimalik, 70,000 in Bokhtar, 100,000 in Dangara, and 147,000 in Khulyab.\n5. The population of Khatlon Region is 2.1 million. The annual population growth rate is high in\nKhatlon Region, about 3.5 percent in 1999, compared with the national annual growth rate at 2.0\npercent. 2  Khatlon Region is a war-affected area and a destination of returnees. The area was\npopulated  through  forced  relocation  during  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  regime,  leaving  a\npatchwork of mono-ethnic villages. However, most of the villages are now populated with mixed\nethnic groups.\n6. Agriculture is the dominant economic activity in Khatlon Region, and the major agricultural\nproducts are cotton, wheat, and barley. The production of wheat increased from 108,028 tons in\n1992 to 130,817 tons in 1998, whereas the production of cotton decreased from 16,600 tons in\n                                                \n1 TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n2 United Nations Development Programme. 1999. Tajikistan Human Development Report. Dushanbe.", "54\nAppendix 13, page 2\n1992 to 14,200 tons in 1998. In 1999, the production of cereals also decreased, putting the country\nin a food deficit situation.\n7. Although the Government has been pursuing privatization of the state and collective farms,\nprogress has been slow in Khatlon Region. There were 1,392 private farms in Khatlon Region in\n1998 out of a total of 10,207 private farms in the country. In 1998, there were 345 state farms in\nthe country and 184 in Khatlon Region. Of collective farms in 1998, 138 were in Khatlon Region\nand 358 in the country.\n8.  The preliminary social assessment identified the following major problems of the districts in\nthe  project  area:  lack  of  agricultural  inputs  and  fertilizer,  inadequate  irrigation,  and  lack  of\ntransportation services. These problems have resulted in very low agricultural yields, and in some\nplaces only half of the arable land is under cultivation.\n9. During site visits by missions, farmers stated that one of their serious concerns was the lack\nof road transport services to the central markets for sale of their products. Transport services are\nvery limited due to serious damage to the roads, shortages of fuel (mainly gasoline), and high\nprices  of  road  transport  services  due  to  inadequate  supply  (TJR1,200  for  a  trip  by  bus  to\nDushanbe). The deputy chairman of Kazimalik emphasized that the prices of agricultural products\nare much higher in Dushanbe (about 15 to 20 percent) than those in local markets. The improved\nroad transport services will reduce the transportation costs for farmers, and provide them with\nopportunities to increase income.\nC.  Living Conditions\n10. The average household size in Tajikistan is 7.1 persons. The household size of urban and\nrural families is 5.7 and 7.6 persons, respectively. In Khatlon Region, the average household size\nis slightly higher, about 7.7 in urban areas and 7.8 in rural areas.\n11. Household income has severely decreased in the last decade. Drawing of wages and\nsalaries, once the primary source of income, has ceased for most families. In 1991, salaries\nrepresented 70 percent of total average income, but in 1996 they represented only 37 percent. The\nsources of household income in Khatlon Region in 1999 are summarized in Table A13.\nTable A13: Source of Household Income in Khatlon Region (1999)\n(Percent)\nItem Total Urban Rural\nSource of Income\nSalary  15.2  43.0  10.3\nIncome from personal plot, including commercial activity 62.9  30.4  68.7\nHumanitarian aid   3.7   5.3   3.4\nSocial allowances (pension and benefits)   0.8   1.4   0.7\nOther income including cash received as gift  17.4 19.9 16.9\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0\nSource: Republic of Tajikistan State Statistical Agency.\n12. The majority of the population (72 percent) lives in rural areas where salaries are very low.\nSalaries in rural areas (equivalent to $2.50-$4.50 a month) are estimated from 33 to 57 percent of\nthe average national salary. In the project area, the annual salary of the low-income group of the", "55\nAppendix 13, page 3\npopulation was estimated from about TJR30,000 to TJR40,000. With the low wage levels and with\naverage family size at more than six persons, 86 percent of the household budget goes for food\npurchases. This ratio is 82 percent in urban areas and 91 percent in rural areas.  As a result of\nprice increases due to removal of subsidies and price controls, more and more people live in a self-\nsufficient manner by producing their own food. Migration to urban areas has become the only\noption for many, and the migration trend is expected to rise over time.\n13. The decline of state-owned enterprises, including state and collective farms, has led to\nwidespread unemployment. Even though the official unemployment rate was only 3.2 percent in\n1999, the actual rate was estimated from 30 to 35 percent. State employees have also suffered in\nsocial terms since independence, not only because of their low average salaries, but because\nwages are frequently in arrears. In the social sectors, the monthly salaries for teachers and health\ncare and social workers are far from sufficient to meet their minimum consumption requirements.\n14. The Government\u2019s existing social protection system is not adequate to meet basic needs.\nIn the past, the state provided uniform social security for the population with little differentiation or\ntargeting. In a country where 83 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and where\nfiscal constraints prevent the use of public funds to provide the level of social support experienced\nunder the FSU, the need to rationalize the social security system is critical.\n15. Women and girls in particular are exposed to poor living conditions. The combined effects\nof transition, the civil conflict, the collapse of the state social safety net, and an increase in\nculturally based gender discrimination, have especially affected women and girls. The economic\ntransition  has  resulted  in  closure  of  industries  such  as  textile  manufacturing  and  agricultural\nprocessing that employed a primarily female labor force. The number of households headed by\nwomen has increased as a direct consequence of the civil conflict, in which approximately 26,000\nfamilies lost their primary breadwinner. Although an exact figure on the number of households\nheaded by women in the project area is not available, key informants stated that the number in\nKhatlon Region is high, which seems reasonable due to the central location of Khatlon Region\nduring the civil conflict.\n16. The population within the project area has access to schools and health facilities, but the\nquality of these facilities is very poor. The education sector has particularly suffered from the civil\nconflict  as  schools  were  used  as  military  bases,  and  equipment  and  materials  were  stolen.\nTeachers left their positions due to low salaries.  Provision of free school meals has been stopped\nresulting in increasing nutrition deficiency among children.\n17. Access to safe drinking water has declined from 60 percent in 1997 to 48 percent in 1998.\nIn rural areas, only 15 percent of the population had access in 1997. Under these circumstances, a\nnumber of serious diseases such as diarrhea and tuberculosis, which are known to be closely\nlinked with poor living conditions, have sharply increased.\nD.   Major Problems of Communities\n18. One of the main problems for the communities in the project area is a severe lack of\nemployment opportunities. In the project area, the unemployment rate was estimated at about 25\npercent. The quality of health and education facilities in the project area is very poor, resulting in\nsevere health problems.", "56\nAppendix 13, page 4\n19. Low agriculture production is another concern. One of the causes has been the lack of all\u2013\nweather road transport facilities and good road transport services necessary for the transport of\nagricultural inputs and outputs. The majority of farmers in the project area depend on transport\nservices to sell their products in the central markets. Due to irregular and expensive transport,\nhowever, most of the farmers sell their products locally, which results in lower income through\nsales at much lower prices than if the products were sold at the central markets.\nE.   Expected Beneficiaries\n20. All groups of affected individuals are expected to benefit from the Project. The Project is\nexpected to have a positive impact on socioeconomic development in the region, to provide\nimmediate economic benefits for farmers through better access to markets and to agricultural\ninputs, and to generate employment in local economies. The improvement of 150 km of rural roads\nin the project area will improve access to markets and social facilities for farmers living off the main\nroad. The Government has agreed to ensure that necessary maintenance of the rural roads is\ncarried out.  In addition, industries will benefit from an improved road network to city centers in the\nproject area, for transportation of export goods and improved distribution of products to major\ncities, including Dushanbe.\nF.   Vulnerable Groups\n21. No major adverse impact from the Project is expected. All road sections included in the\nProject involve existing roads, and their rehabilitation will not result in the development of new\nconduits for disease transmission or increase the potential for disease transmission. The Project\nwill not require any permanent acquisition of land.\n22. The Project will have a positive impact on social groups in the project area. Skilled and\nunskilled  labor  will  be  engaged  for  the  rehabilitation  works  and  for  routine  and  periodic\nmaintenance works after project completion. This will generate temporary and permanent income\nsources for the people living near the road, and help lower unemployment in the local economy.\nThere are no issues related to indigenous people.\nG.  Gender Issues\n23. No gender issues are expected to arise during project implementation. Given the difficult\nphysical conditions of rehabilitation works, women may not benefit from direct participation in the\nworks, but rather through indirect participation. One opportunity is that they may work in the\nworkers\u2019  service  station  during  the  construction  period.  No  adverse  impacts  on  women  are\nenvisaged at this stage. The Project will build and use a gender disaggregated monitoring system,\nto assess the impact of the Project on women in particular.\nH. Conclusion\n24. Based  on  the  social  impact  assessment  carried  out  during  ADB\u2019s  project  processing\nmissions, the Project will not have any major adverse social impacts and will not require any\nresettlement.  The  minor  adverse  impacts  will  be  mitigated  in  accordance  with  the  measures\nrecommended in this SIA to a satisfactory level. The Project will be able to contribute to local\nsocioeconomic development and poverty reduction by (i) providing temporary and permanent\nemployment opportunities for the unskilled and skilled laborers living near the project road; (ii)\ngenerating additional business opportunities for local people through purchase of local construction", "57\nAppendix 13, page 5\nmaterials and daily consumables; and (iii) reducing transport costs and enhancing access of the\nrural population to markets, other economic opportunities, and social services.", "58\nAppendix 14, page 1\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nINSTITUTIONAL AND POLICY SUPPORT IN ROAD SECTOR\nA.  Objectives\n1. The main objective of the technical assistance (TA) is to implement the market-oriented\npolicy reforms initiated under the Asian Development Bank\u2013financed Postconflict Infrastructure\nProgram,1 and the recommendations for sector policy reforms and institutional restructuring\nmade  by  the  ADB\u2013financed  TA  3114.2  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  build  up  basic\ninstitutional  capacity  in  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  to  enable  economic  recovery  and\ndevelop the road subsector.

General\n1. The economic analysis was carried out on the basis of a comparison of the with- and\nwithout-project scenarios. Economic prices are expressed using the world price numeraire. The\nProject involves rehabilitation of approximately 80 kilometers of the Dushanbe-Khulyab road. In\nthe without\u2013project scenario, the road would receive only minimal maintenance and continue to\ndeteriorate. The with-project scenario includes routine and periodic maintenance according to\ninternational standards as part of the program prepared under the project preparatory technical\nassistance (TA).1 The economic analysis covers a period of 24 years (2001-2024), including\nabout 4 years for project implementation. All benefits and costs were estimated in constant 2000\nprices.\nB. Costs\n2. Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and\nmaintenance, as well as rural road improvement, equipment, and consulting services. Costs\nwere divided into tradable and nontradable groups. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was\nthen applied to the nontradable portion. The opportunity cost of unskilled labor was valued at\n0.75.\nC. Benefits\n3. The  principal  sources  of  economic  benefits  for  the  Project  are  savings  in  vehicle\noperating costs (VOCs), passenger time savings, and benefits arising from generated traffic.\nEconomic benefits were calculated using the same method used for costs. The Project will\nimprove  the  access  of  the  rural  poor  to  markets  and  social  services,  and  improve  safety\nconditions on the road. However, sufficient data is not available to quantify these benefits, and\nthey were not included in the analysis.\n4. Savings in VOCs comprise the largest category of benefits, accounting for more than 85\npercent of total benefits, and arise from the improved road conditions resulting from the civil\nworks carried out under the Project. The VOCs are calculated for each vehicle type. Unit\neconomic VOCs for passenger and freight vehicles were estimated using the highway design\nand maintenance model (HDM-Manager). VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements\nin  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment,  and  increased  average  speed  in  some\nsections. Estimates of VOC savings by vehicle type are shown in Table A15.1. Benefits from\nVOC savings for generated traffic are estimated at half the value for normal traffic.\n                                                \n1 TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.", "63\nAppendix 15, page 2\nTable A15.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type\n($ per \u2018000 vehicle-km)\nLight Medium Heavy Articulated\nScenario Cars Pickups Buses Trucks Trucks Trucks Trucks\nWithout Project  a 143.0 135.6 1079.5 276.1 615.9 1319.0 897.7\nWith Project  b 123.8 112.0 1024.0 242.7 547.7 1179.7 793.6\nVOC Savings 19.2 23.6 55.5 33.4 68.2 139.3 104.1\nVOC = vehicle operating costs.\na  For an international roughness indicator of 8.7.\nb  For an international roughness indicator of 4.4.\nD. Results of Economic Analysis\n5. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated for the national road sections\nand for the overall Project. The EIRR for the overall Project is 15.9 percent (Table A15.2). The\nEIRRs for the national road sections range from 14.2 to 25.4 percent. Sensitivity analysis was\ncarried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine the\nbenefits and costs of the Project. The sensitivity analysis, shown in Table A15.3, indicates that\ncosts would have to increase by 35 percent and benefits decrease by 26 percent for the EIRR to\nreach the cutoff level of 12 percent. Given the uncomplicated nature of the rehabilitation works\nand ADB's experience with similar projects in other Central Asian republics, such changes are\nunlikely to occur.", "  64\nAppendix 15, page 3\nTable A15.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n($ million)\nCosts Benefits\nVOC Savings Time  Generated  Total \nYear Capital Maintenance Total Costs Net Benefits\nSavings Traffic Benefits\n2001 3.468 3.468 (3.468)\n2002 6.643 6.643 (6.643)\n2003 5.897 5.897 (5.897)\n2004 5.897 0.005 5.902 (5.902)\n2005 3.468 0.103 3.571 2.849 0.182 0.281 3.064 (0.507)\n2006 0.000 0.113 0.113 3.192 0.205 0.312 3.430 3.317\n2007 1.835 0.037 1.872 3.477 0.225 0.339 3.738 1.866\n2008 1.342 0.119 1.461 3.930 0.253 0.377 4.217 2.756\n2009 1.457 0.218 1.675 4.605 0.299 0.432 4.935 3.260\n2010 1.719 0.096 1.814 5.197 0.340 0.481 5.565 3.751\n2011 0.459 0.111 0.569 5.915 0.388 0.540 6.329 5.759\n2012 0.000 0.142 0.142 6.514 0.436 0.590 6.974 6.832\n2013 0.846 0.310 1.156 7.028 0.484 0.633 7.533 6.377\n2014 0.352 0.562 0.914 7.839 0.547 0.699 8.402 7.488\n2015 0.000 1.048 1.048 8.413 0.589 0.744 9.014 7.966\n2016 0.000 0.293 0.293 8.990 0.633 0.793 9.633 9.340\n2017 2.474 0.221 2.695 9.511 0.676 0.837 10.195 7.500\n2018 0.549 0.130 0.679 10.495 0.723 0.903 11.210 10.531\n2019 0.000 0.468 0.468 11.164 0.772 0.953 11.921 11.453\n2020 0.000 0.327 0.327 11.721 0.819 0.998 12.520 12.193\n2021 0.000 0.345 0.345 12.405 0.865 1.049 13.244 12.898\n2022 1.642 0.341 1.983 13.049 0.915 1.097 13.929 11.946\n2023 0.000 0.228 0.228 14.248 0.979 1.213 15.204 14.976\n2024 1.304 0.395 1.699 14.764 1.023 1.260 15.766 14.067\nVOC = vehicle operating costs.\nSource: Staff estimates. economic internal rate of return = 15.9%\nnet present value = 8.0\nTable A15.3: Sensitivity Analysis\nEIRR Switching\nScenario (%) Values (%)\n1.

Introduction\n1. The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  consultants  prepared  a  poverty\nimpact analysis (PIA) of the proposed Tajikistan Road Rehabilitation Project. The analysis was\ncarried out in June and July 2000.\n2. The PIA\n(i)  assessed the extent to which transport cost reductions will be passed on to\npassengers and owners of freight;\n(ii)  assessed the distribution of the net benefits between these and other groups;\n(iii)  identified the proportion of poor and very poor beneficiaries and the net benefits\nthey will receive;\n(iv)  clarified the assumptions and analysis behind the distribution analysis and\npoverty impact assessment; and\n(v)  identified complementary activities to help reduce poverty in the project area.\n3. The main findings of the study are that the Project will bring direct benefits to the poor\nand very poor people in the project area. This will be achieved by conveying a substantial share\nof the net benefits from the main project road to the poor and very poor by decreasing vehicle\noperating costs and creating employment opportunities. Maximum impact will be achieved if the\ntransport  sector  is  rendered  more  competitive  by  implementing  the  recommended  policy\nmeasures.\nB.  Project Area\n1. Description of the Project Area and Project Impact Area\n4. The project is located in Khatlon Region in southwestern Tajikistan. Since the main\nproject  road  is  part  of  the  national  road  network,  which  provides  international  as  well  as\ninterregional communications, the Project\u2019s impact area is considered to be the Khatlon Region.\nThe road serves the majority of the region\u2019s population and economic activities, and most of the\nimpacts of the road rehabilitation project will occur in this region. However, the majority of the\nimpacts of the road rehabilitation project will occur in the project area geographically identified to\ninclude a corridor of land on either side of the alignment. This road corridor falls almost entirely\nwithin Khatlon Region, and covers an area of 5,080 square km south of Dushanbe, the capital\nand largest city. The PIA has restricted its data collection and analysis to the project area itself,\nwhile the whole region is considered when assessing broader impact issues.\n5. Khatlon is the most populous of Tajikistan\u2019s four regions, with an estimated 35 percent of\nthe country\u2019s total population of 6.1 million. Although Khatlon Region contains Tajikistan\u2019s third\nand fourth largest cities (Khulyab and Kurgan\u2013Tyube), the economy of the area is primarily\nagricultural.  Cotton, grains (primarily wheat and barley), fruits, and vegetables are the primary\ncrops. Aside from cotton, much of the agricultural production is transported to markets where it\n                                                \n1 TA  3168 \u2013TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.", "66\nAppendix 16, page 2\nis sold directly to consumers. Khatlon\u2019s small rural towns rely more on agriculture than do towns\nin the rest of the nation.  Trade is ranked as the second most important economic activity in the\nregion. Manufacturing is in a distant third place. Agriculture is the largest source of employment,\nand its share of total employment has steadily increased, reaching 65 percent in 1998. Roads\nare  the  most  important  means  of  domestic  transport  in  Tajikistan,  supporting  agricultural\nproduction and providing vital access for the rural population to the main administrative centers\nand markets. Khatlon Region is described as worse off than other regions, due in part to the fact\nthat the heaviest fighting during the civil war was in Khatlon. For example, damage due to civil\nunrest is more prevalent in Khatlon Region and slightly more prevalent among the poorest 20\npercent of households.\n2. Poverty in the Project Area\n6. The most comprehensive source of data on poverty in Tajikistan is the Tajikistan Living\nStandards Survey2 (TLSS) conducted by the State Statistical Agency with TA from World Bank\nand  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  The  TLSS  collected  data  on\ndemographics, housing, expenditure, consumption, and other indicators. Levels of poverty in\nTajikistan are high with approximately 83 percent of the population not able to afford the\nminimum  consumption  basket.3  This  means  that  approximately  5  million  Tajik  people  are\nconcerned about how they will provide for their basic necessities.  Ninety-one percent of the\npopulation of Khatlon Region (approximately 2 million) are living below the poverty line. Table\nA16.1 shows the geographic profile of poverty in the country.\nTable A16.1: Poverty Levels in Tajikistan by Region\nItem Poor Nonpoor Total Population\n(000) (000) (000)\nDushanbe 384 178 562\nGBAR 190 16 206\nRRS 892 446 1,338\nLeninbad 1,591 279 1,870\nKhatlon 1,845 306 2,151\n     Total 4,902 1,225 6,127\nNote :  GBAR = Gorno-Badakshan Autonomous Region, RRS = Region of Republican Subordination.\nSource: World Bank. 2000.

The TLSS asked a number of questions about access to medical care and educational\nfacilities.  The overall picture that emerges is that the poor have good access to health and\neducation establishments. However, households as a group have slightly worse access then\nhouseholds elsewhere in the country. These differences are not great, according to the PIA\nsurvey, and may not be statistically significant.\n8. The surveys undertaken under the PIA confirm that people using the project road have\ngood access to health and education facilities.  Among passengers surveyed, 73 percent said\nthat the school was less than a kilometer from their house. Virtually all passengers reported that\ntheir children walked to school, and 90 percent said it took less than 30 minutes. In terms of\n                                                \n2 Republic of Tajikistan State Statistical Agency. 1999. Tajikistan Living Standards Survey. Dushanbe.\n3   The State Statistical Agency poverty line is estimated to be TJR 20,000 per person per month.", "67\nAppendix 16, page 3\naccess to medical care, the TLSS indicates that for most households, access (measured by\ntime) was relatively easy.  However access was slightly less easy for people in Khatlon, with\nnearly 70 percent of individuals in the poorest households travelling for 30 or fewer minutes,\ncompared with over 80 percent for individuals in the rest of the country.\n9. According to a survey by a nongovernment organization (NGO),4 overall infant and\nmaternal mortality levels are high due to high numbers of births and insufficient family planning.\nNinety percent of women give birth at home. The reason given was insufficient transportation\nfrom distant villages to larger towns. These results are at variance with the results of the TLSS\nand the PIA surveys.  Part of the reason for the difference is that the poor were under-\nrepresented among the passengers using the main project road, i.e., the subject of the PIA\nsurvey. Improving the rural road network to lower the cost of transport would help alleviate these\naccess problems.\n4.  Access to Transport Services in the Project Area\n10. Based on the PIA survey, outside of Dushanbe, 60 percent of drivers, farmers, and\npassengers using the transportation markets in the project area are poor, compared with 91\npercent of the people in the region. In general, the characteristics of the poor respondents did\nnot differ substantially from those of the overall group, although the poor owned and used\npassenger  vehicles  much  less  than  the  nonpoor,  and  the  poor  used  buses  much  more\nfrequently. Farmers, traveling as passengers, most often brought their produce to market using\nbuses or minibuses.\nC.  Poverty Impact of the Project\n11. Infrastructure  projects  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  direct  and  indirect\nbenefits.  Direct  benefits  are  concerned  with  improving  access  to  economic  and  social\nopportunities, including labor and product markets, and enhancing human capital formation,\nespecially  education  and  health.  Indirect  benefits  involve  increasing  efficiency  of  resource\nallocation, especially the performance of markets, flexibility of adjustments, and the fostering of\neconomic growth.\n12. The  Project  comprises  three  components  that  impact  on  poverty  reduction:  (i)\nrehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road, (ii) improvement of rural roads, and (iii) policy\nreform. Rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road is of strategic significance to the national\neconomy and is likely to stimulate regional and national income growth. The improvement of the\nrural roads is likely to make only a modest contribution to national income growth, but is likely to\nhave a direct and significant impact on the daily life of the poor in the project area. Policy reform\nwill enhance the direct and indirect impact of the road rehabilitation and improvement.\n1. Poverty Impact of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab Road Rehabilitation\n13. The PIA survey interviewed passengers, farmers, and drivers. The results suggest that\n60 percent of the users and drivers of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road are poor. The poor use\nbuses more often than higher-income passengers. Their frequency of travel overall appears to\nbe about the same as the higher-income passengers. Over three quarters of passengers using\nthe project road are men.  The occupational profile of the poor passengers did not differ from\nthe higher-income passengers.  About 20 percent of the poor passengers reported working in\nthe private sector, 20 percent for the government, 6 percent were housewives, 6 percent were\n                                                \n4 NGO Household Livelihood Security Assessment. 2000. Dushanbe.", "68\nAppendix 16, page 4\nstudents, 10 percent were pensioners, and 6 percent were jobless. The average age of the poor\npassengers was 41, about the same as for all passengers. Poor passengers had a slightly\nhigher average household size (nine people) than passengers as a whole (eight people).\n14. The results of the survey of farmers suggested that about 60 percent were poor.  About\n20 percent said they sold their produce locally and did not use motorized transport to reach\nmarkets.  This proportion also applies to poor farmers.  About 70 percent of the farmers said\nthey sold their produce more than once a week, and about 70 percent said they did not use an\nintermediate dealer because they were not satisfied with the prices these dealers offered.  All\nusers of motorized transport lease vehicles to bring their produce to market. The average age\nfor all farmers was 41, and 80 percent were male. This was about the same for poor farmers.\n2.  Poverty Impact of the Rural Road Improvement\n15. The Project will improve about 150 km of local, rural, and farm roads in Khatlon Region.\nLocal roads are secondary roads linking settlements to the national roads. Rural and farm roads\nare small roads linking farms to each other and linking large farms to local roads. Usually, rural\nand farm roads have a gravel or dirt surface and are quite rough. Local roads are larger than\nrural roads and often have asphalt, concrete, or a smooth gravel surface. Usually no public\ntransport services exist on rural roads and traffic of motorized vehicles in general is low. Local\nroads  usually  have  transport  services  (both  private  and  public),  but  their  frequency  and\navailability vary greatly.\n16. The local, rural, and farm roads (henceforth referred to as rural roads) to be included in\nthe Project will be identified by the consultants and approved by the Government and the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  in  accordance  with  selection  criteria  focusing  on  poverty  and  social\nconsiderations, traffic levels, costs and economic returns, sustainability issues, and links to\nother relevant projects in the project area. The Government has agreed to selection criteria for\nthe  rural  roads  (Appendix  6).  Small  and  medium\u2013size  holders  will  be  involved  in  the\nidentification of the rural roads to be rehabilitated in order to encourage active participation and\naddress their needs. In addition, provincial officials responsible for the education and health\ndepartments will be consulted to address any issues concerning access to health centers and\neducation.\n17. The primary benefits that farmers in the project area will experience from improvement\nof the rural roads will be (i) reduced loss of produce due to poor conditions of the roads, and (ii)\nincreased  income  due  to  increasing  competitiveness  among  traders  arising  from  improved\naccess to rural areas.  Surveys indicate that the most important transport\u2013related problems\nfaced by poor farmers are the cost and availability of transport services, and lost income from\ndamage to agricultural produce caused by bad road conditions. All farmers interviewed by both\nthe PIA survey and the appraisal survey stated that transport services account for almost 20\npercent of the final price they receive in the market. In addition, transport services in Khatlon\nRegion are of low quality due to inadequate maintenance of vehicles and lack of spare parts.\nThe resulting infrequent and unreliable transport services cause farmers to spend long hours\nwaiting. On average, farmers indicate losing 15 percent of their agricultural profit due to damage\ncaused by bad conditions of the roads leading to markets.  Poor farmers said they lost 20\npercent of their agricultural profit due to bad conditions on these roads.\n18. Farmers interviewed for the PIA either sold their produce locally (without making use of\nmotorized transport) or they sold their produce to wholesale traders who, in turn, brought it to\nthe market.  About 70 percent of farmers said they did not use traders because they were not", "69\nAppendix 16, page 5\nsatisfied with the prices traders offered (on average, 50 percent less than prices in the markets).\nIn general, however, farmers prefer using traders rather than make the long and expensive\njourneys to the markets themselves.\n3. Poverty Impact of the Policy Component\n19. Since  independence,  Tajikistan  has  made  substantial  progress  in  increasing  the\ncompetitiveness of transport markets. However, the Government still maintains a presence in\nproviding transportation services. The drivers\u2019 survey indicates that the Government\u2019s role as a\ndirect provider of transport services does limit competition, and limited competition will result in\nsome share of the benefits of the Project not being passed on to consumers. If the current state\nof competition prevails, a portion of the savings in vehicle operating costs will not be passed on\nto passengers but will be divided between the Government and the private-sector vehicle\nowners. The surveys reveal that several institutional barriers prevent transport markets from\nbeing more competitive. Both the direct and indirect impacts of the road rehabilitation project\nwould be greatly enhanced if the transport market becomes more competitive, and drivers and\nvehicle owners pass on most of their cost savings to transport users in the form of lower fares\nand freight rates. The Government has agreed to commercialize all road transport service\noperations, excluding large-scale urban ones, and privatize 25 percent of the operations by\nproject completion. This process, which will include the ending of mandatory tariffs for freight\nand passenger operations, will increase the competitiveness of transport markets and help\nensure that project benefits are passed on to the poor.\n4.  Distribution of Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio\n20. The estimated direct benefits of the trunk road to the economy as a whole are $8.0\nmillion in present value (PV) terms. This simply represents the sum of the PV of benefits to\npassengers,  freight  users,  vehicle  owners,  and  the  Government.  This  is  a  conservative\nestimate, because only direct benefits of the Project are considered. Table A16.2 presents the\nestimated benefits for each of the categories of beneficiaries.\nTable A16.2: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio\n($ million)\nPassenger Freight Vehicle\nYear Users Users Owners Government Total\nNPV 4.130 1.947 5.578 (3.612) 8.044\nProportion of Poor (%) 60 60 30 10\nBenefits to Poor 2.478 1.168 1.673 (0.361) 4.959\nPoverty Impact Ratio 0.62\nNPV = net present value.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n21. There will also be indirect benefits, such as the increased trade and economic activity\nthat are partly induced by the improved road. The size of these indirect benefits depends on\nhow the regional and national economies grow over the Project's time horizon. These indirect\nbenefits will impact the poor in two ways: first, by creating job and other economic opportunities;\nand second, given the Government\u2019s commitment to maintain a budget allocation of 37 percent\nfor overall social sector expenditure, the tax revenue arising from the generated economic\nactivity will provide more funding for social services.", "70\nAppendix 16, page 6\n22. The PIA study computed the poverty impact ratio (PIR) for the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road\nbased on the present value of the benefits. This is the proportion of project benefits that accrue\nto the poor. The PIR is 0.62 indicating that 62 percent of the net project benefits reach poor\nusers. For the very poor, the PIR is estimated at 0.10, or 10 percent of the net project benefits.\nA sensitivity analysis of the PIR is shown in Table A16.3.\nTable A16.3: Poverty Impact Ratio\nItem Poor (%) Very Poor (%)\nBase Case:\n     With normal competition in the transport sector 62 10\nSensitivity Analysis:\n     With low competition in the transport market 44  2\n     With high competition in the transport market 80 15\nNote: The PIR was calculated assuming that 10 percent of the Government\u2019s net benefits (costs) will be incurred\nby the poor, while the very poor do not incur any of the Government\u2019s expenditure.\n23. The PIR increases with increases in competition; the higher the level of competition in\nthe transport markets, the higher the PIR is for both targeted categories, poor and very poor\npeople. This illustrates the importance of enhancing competition in the transport market not only\nto fuel economic growth but also to help reduce poverty. With higher competition in the transport\nmarket, drivers and vehicle owners will pass on most of their cost savings to transport users in\nthe form of lower fares and freight rates. Consequently, to the extent that transport costs will\nlower the cost of delivering agricultural products to the market, these cost savings will be\npassed on to consumers."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20001130144904", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "ldm", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R287-00.doc", "ModDate": "D:20010305165236+08'00'"}}
