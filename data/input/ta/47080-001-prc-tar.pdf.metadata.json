During  the  2012  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for public expenditure performance monitoring in Henan. The \nTA is consistent with ADB's PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, which is aligned with \nthe priorities of the government\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan for National Social and Economic \nDevelopment, 2011\u20132015.12 The TA will address issues related to public financial management \nand good governance in Henan. These issues are also relevant for other parts of the PRC. \n \n2.  An  ADB  fact-finding  mission  visited  Henan  in  August  2013.  The  mission  met  with \ngovernment agencies and think tanks at various levels. An agreement was reached with the \nHenan provincial government on the TA\u2019s main features including impact, outcome, outputs, \nactivities,  financing  plan,  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services,  and  implementation \narrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Henan Province is located in the central region of the PRC. It is one of the country\u2019s \nmost populous provinces, with over 94 million inhabitants, about 7% of the PRC\u2019s population. \nHenan's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012 was CNY3 trillion, accounting for 5.7% of the \nPRC\u2019s GDP, and its per capita GDP was 82.5% of the national average. \n \n4.  As a populous and traditional agricultural province, most of Henan\u2019s fiscal outlays have \nbeen allocated for agriculture, forestry, water resources, education, social security, health care, \nand  transfer  payments  from  the  Henan  provincial  government  to  prefectural  and  county \ngovernments. The fiscal expenditure in Henan has increased at a significantly faster pace than \nfiscal revenue in the past 10 years. In addition to balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure, \npublic financial management has started to focus on enhancing the effectiveness of public \nexpenditure performance. However, due to the lack of adequate performance monitoring and \nevaluation  mechanisms,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  fiscal \nexpenditure, including that for special purpose projects. \n \n5.  Improving public financial management (including standardizing intergovernmental fiscal \ntransfers and monitoring public expenditure) and ensuring good governance at all levels of \ngovernment and across all sectors are critical to support the PRC's long-term goal of building a \nharmonious and prosperous society by improving people\u2019s livelihood, and promoting balanced \nand environmentally sustainable growth. The central government stresses the need to improve \nthe public finance system and the financial management of public finance.4  \n \n6.  Sound  public  financial  management  improves  accountability  and  efficiency  in  the \nmanagement of public resources and delivery of public services in line with public needs. Since \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n2  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2011. The Outline of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan for National Social \nand Economic Development. Beijing. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 August 2013. \n4  For example, in the 2008 Government Work Report, Premier Wen Jiabao proposed an administrative system of \naccountability and a budget performance management system. In 2010, President Hu Jintao, at the 18th collective \nstudy of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, stressed that the country \nneeded to improve the public finance system and the performance of financial management. In 2012, the new \nleadership also emphasized the importance of undertaking fiscal and taxation reform, and strengthening the public \nfinance system at the 18th National Congress of CPC. \n ", "2  \n2008, the PRC has actively explored various forms of public financial management including \nperformance-based budgeting and performance monitoring. However, the efforts are still at an \ninitial  and  exploratory  stage.  For  example,  regulations  and  systems  of  performance \nmanagement  and  monitoring  are  inadequate;  budget  units  lack  the  understanding  and \nknowledge  of  performance  management  and  monitoring;  and  the  results  of  performance \nmonitoring deviate markedly from the original targets. These issues have seriously hampered \nthe efficient and effective use of fiscal funds. As such, it is important to further strengthen \nresearch, deepen the understanding of and awareness about performance monitoring, and \npropose  appropriate  policy  recommendations  to  improve  the  overall  public  financial \nmanagement system.  \n \n7.  Henan  is  one  of  the  provinces  exploring  measures  to  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement. Revenue reform is an important aspect of sound public financial management. \nHowever, as most tax bases and rates are set by the central government, revenue reform would \nbe best pursued as part of a wider national agenda of fiscal reform. In provinces, more attention \nshould  be  attached  to  public  expenditure  management.  Moreover,  as  80%  of  the  transfer \npayments are for special purpose projects, clarifying the scope of transfer payments for special \npurposes at the sub-provincial level deserves high priority. \n \n8.  The  Henan  provincial  government  seeks  ADB\u2019s  TA  to  help  strengthen  its  public \nexpenditure  performance  monitoring  system  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of \npublic spending, and thereby enhance the governance of public expenditure. A strengthened \npublic expenditure performance monitoring system could maximize value for public outlays; \nincrease the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure; enhance the awareness of due \ndiligence and the responsibility of government departments in provinces and sub-provinces. \nSuch a public expenditure performance monitoring framework could also be applied in other \nprovinces in the PRC, thus contributing to achieving national objectives. Moreover, this TA \nproject would help enhance the governance of public expenditure.  \n \n9.  Although ADB\u2019s earlier TAs have covered a wide range of fiscal issues in the PRC, they \nare  yet  to  address  public  expenditure  performance  monitoring  at  provincial  level.5 Close \nattention  will  be  paid,  as  relevant,  to  building  on  other  ADB  TAs  and  the  public  finance \nassistance supported by other development partners. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  will  be  strengthened  public  financial  management  in  Henan.  The \nachievement will be demonstrated by an integrated evaluation and monitoring framework on \npublic expenditure performance. The key outcome will be improved efficiency and effectiveness \nof public expenditure in Henan. \n                                                \n5  Relevant TAs include: ADB. 2008.

The  TA  will  assist  the  Henan  provincial  government  to  improve  public  expenditure \nperformance monitoring. It will review the concept of public expenditure performance monitoring \nand summarize relevant domestic and international experience. The TA will also analyze how \npublic expenditure has been monitored, identify the major issues in evaluating and monitoring \npublic  expenditure  performance,  and  clarify  the  major  constraints  on  implementing  public \nexpenditure performance monitoring in Henan. It will identify major areas of public expenditure \nto be monitored, propose appropriate indicators, and recommend an integrated framework for \npublic expenditure performance monitoring in Henan. \n \n12.  The TA outputs will be (i) a final report and a bilingual synopsis report on improving \npublic expenditure performance monitoring in Henan and (ii) two policy briefing notes. The final \nreport will present a set of guidelines and methods to help implement a public expenditure \nperformance monitoring system in Henan. It will comprise three parts: (i) overview, concepts, \nand experience; (ii) major issues and challenges in public expenditure performance monitoring; \nand (iii) policy recommendations.  \n \n13.  Part  1  will  review  and  clarify  (i)  the  concept  of  public  expenditure  performance \nmonitoring including principles, methods, indicators, and standards; (ii) how public expenditure \nis currently being monitored in Henan; and (iii) international and domestic experiences in public \nexpenditure performance monitoring. In the areas of budget control, risk prevention, monitoring \norganizations, performance evaluation, and information technology, the TA will focus on the \nexperience  of  Australia,  Germany,  and  the  United  States.  For  the  possible  application  of \naccrual-basis accounting in budget management, the focus will be on the experience of New \nZealand and the United Kingdom. Further, special attention will also be paid to the experience \nof Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces of the PRC. \n \n14.  Part 2 will identify the major issues relating to public expenditure performance monitoring \nin Henan, including transfer payments for special projects. It will identify the key obstacles to \nimplementing a public expenditure performance monitoring system, identify priority areas for \npublic expenditure, and propose appropriate indicators for monitoring. On this basis, the TA will \nrecommend an integrated public expenditure performance monitoring framework for Henan \nincluding targets, standards for evaluation, and indicators.  \n \n15.  Part 3 will contain a comprehensive set of policy recommendations for establishing an \nappropriate  public  expenditure  performance  monitoring  system  for  Henan,  including  policy \nsuggestions on basic reforms in the fiscal system and the performance monitoring mechanism. \n \n16.  Based on the final report, a bilingual synopsis report (around 15 pages in Chinese and \n15  pages  in  English)  will  be  prepared  for  senior  decision  makers  in  Henan.  During  TA \nimplementation, two policy briefing notes will be prepared and submitted to the Henan provincial \ngovernment and the Ministry of Finance. \n \n17.  Major activities of the TA include (i) hosting workshops and conferences (inception, \nmidterm review, final review, and dissemination), in particular, inviting government officials from \nother provinces to participate in the dissemination workshop; (ii) conducting domestic surveys \nand  international  study  visits  as  appropriate;  and  (iii)  preparing  reports  (inception  report, \nmidterm report, final report, progress reports, and policy briefing notes).  \n \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $562,500, of which $450,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).
