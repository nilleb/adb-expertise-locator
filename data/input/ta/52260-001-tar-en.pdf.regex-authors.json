INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support capacity building of \nPakistan\u2019s federal and provincial governments on the structural transformation, programming, and \nmanagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) portfolio in Pakistan. \n \n2.  Initiated at the request of the Government of Pakistan, the TA will (i) facilitate the effective \nand efficient delivery of the development impacts of new structural reform initiatives; and (ii) \ndeepen the anchoring of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, country programming, and portfolio \nmanagement in the government\u2019s policies and strategies.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Pakistan national election in July 2018 brought new challenges. The new government \nhas taken over the reins of the country, yet it is still going through a process of converting its broad \n100-days agenda into a well-defined strategy and a plan in which the ADB program can be firmly \nplaced. The government urgently needs to address the large budget and current account deficits, \nrising debt obligations, and falling foreign exchange reserves. The key challenges are to adopt \nthe right reforms (e.g., tighten monetary policy, enhance the tax base, contain losses incurred by \npublic sector enterprises, resolve the structural issues that undermine export competitiveness) \nand achieve good outcomes to sustain public support. The pace, quality, and extent of ADB\u2019s \npipeline in Pakistan depends on the speed at which the new government sets its overall and \nsector direction. For this the government requires quick analysis of previous experiences and \nassistance in developing broad and sector strategies and plans for the next 5 years.  \n \n4.  ADB operations in Pakistan have expanded rapidly in 2015-2017 in almost all geographic \nareas of the country, covering energy, transport, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, \nfinance, public sector management, and water and other urban infrastructure and services. As of \n30 September 2018, ADB had committed more than $32 billion in projects and TA to Pakistan. \nADB\u2019s active public sector portfolio in Pakistan had reached $6.90 billion, comprising 33 active \ninvestment projects financed from 40 ADB loans, 9 cofinanced grants, and 2 cofinanced loans. \nCumulative contract awards had reached $3.12 billion and disbursements against commitments \nhad reached $2.07 billion. Still, with more than 50% of the active portfolio to be contracted, the \nchallenge for project implementation remains formidable. During country programming and/or \nportfolio review discussions, many key implementing agencies involved in ADB projects were \nfound to lack effective understanding of ADB guidelines and procedures. Such institutional \ncapacity deficiency can become a major impediment to the efficient and effective delivery of \ndevelopment projects. \n \n5.  Given the revolving nature of senior management roles in planning, finance, line ministries, \npublic sector enterprises, and executing agencies, and limited technical training opportunities for \nthose managers, targeted capacity enhancement is important as it will enable supervisory and \nregulatory bodies to better understand various facets of projects, including procurement and \nfinancial management. The complexity of development projects\u2014in terms of project design, \nimplementation, financial management, and procurement\u2014often lends itself to situations where \ninitiatives are stalled because of oversight requirements from the judiciary, anticorruption bodies, \n                                                \n1  Following discussions with ADB Management during ADB\u2019s 51st Annual Meeting in Manila, the Government of \nPakistan, through its Economics Affairs Division, requested ADB via a letter dated 9 May 2018 to initiate a capacity \nbuilding program for officials of the federal and provincial governments and autonomous bodies. The Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice followed it up during a meeting with the Pakistan Resident Mission country director and the project team on \n19 September 2018. The vice-president (operations 1) approved the TA concept paper on 17 October 2018. \n ", "2 \nand other regulators. While oversight is necessary and provides checks and balances, a lack of \ntechnical training for these entities further hinders projects and leads to delays. \n \n6.  The TA, with its overall focus on enhancing the government\u2019s institutional capacity, will \nassist  the  government\u2019s  structural  transformation  by  (i)  analyzing  current  and  emerging \ndevelopment and policy gaps and overlapping issues (country and/or sector diagnosis, public \nsector reforms), (ii) developing new innovations and sector plans and strategies (consultation and \nplanning and/or strategic frameworks), and (iii) building government capacity to improve project \nquality  at  entry  (new  modalities,  instruments,  and  due  diligence requirements)  and  project \nmanagement during the implementation stages (procurement and consultant recruitment, social \nand  environmental  safeguards,  gender  mainstreaming,  financial  management,  contract \nadministration, and monitoring and evaluation). The impact of capacity development efforts under \ntransaction TA is not usually sustained after a project ends because of the lack of institutional \nresponsibility within relevant government departments or agencies. This highlights the need for \nsystematic capacity building TA that provides this support broadly so as to develop a critical mass \nof people within the government who are not just project based but can effectively respond to \nportfolio challenges across sectors and geographic divisions. \n \n7.  The TA ties in with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which highlights the need to use TA resources \nto support capacity building and policy dialogue in developing member countries, as well as to \npilot-test innovative approaches and solutions in specific areas or sectors.2 ADB will add value by \ncombining finance, knowledge, and partnerships, and working closely with Pakistan governments \nat various levels to identify their needs and produce the most relevant knowledge, plans, and \nproducts. ADB will use the country partnership strategy and country portfolio review as the main \nplatforms for defining customized support, promoting innovative technologies, and delivering \nintegrated solutions by combining expertise across sectors and themes through a mix of public \nand private sector operations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA will be the first of its kind in Pakistan to systematically address the capacity building \ndemand of the government more broadly and respond to the knowledge support needs of key \nstakeholders in a coordinated manner. The TA is aligned with the following impact: development \nimpacts of government reform initiatives and donor-supported operations delivered effectively and \nefficiently. The TA will have the following outcome: capacity of the Government of Pakistan to \ndefine its plans and actions increased and operational knowledge of executing and implementing \nagencies in programming and implementing ADB-supported projects improved.3 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Operational  guidelines  developed,  and  capacity  of  key  government \nagencies enhanced. This output will analyze the factors that hinder project delivery and carry \nout a training needs assessment of federal and local agencies responsible for programming, \nmanaging, and implementing ADB-financed projects through high-level government engagement. \nThe TA team will prepare a consolidated and phased master capacity building approach with \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nindividual training plans and training course materials. With increasing accountability-oriented \nscrutiny for public sector investments, it is likewise important to improve the capacity of the \noversight and judicial bodies to respond to issues related to development projects.4 To this end, \nthis output will also identify the technical needs and gaps in the judicial and oversight systems of \nparticipating agencies to efficiently rule on the arbitration or assessment of development projects. \nThis output will support the delivery of capacity building and training programs in institutional \narrangements, thematic areas, and procedures in core project design and management functions \nsuch  as  country  programming,  project  preparation  and  readiness,  project  management, \nprocurement, contract management, financial management, safeguards, gender, and auditing. \n \n10.  The TA team will develop an ADB Pakistan alumni network which includes Government \nofficials in Pakistan who have received capacity building training through ADB support and \nestablish a capacity assessment and monitoring system. With on-the ground engagement and \nsupport from ADB\u2019s Pakistan Resident Mission, such a network will help maximize and sustain \nbenefits beyond the capacity building training events, and provide government counterparts with \nvaluable platforms of information exchange and connectivity. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Knowledge  products  and  advisory  support  for  the  government\u2019s \nstructural reforms and policy development delivered. This output will promote new priority \nareas (e.g., social safety nets, education, health, water, climate resilience, tourism, job creation, \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment, exports, and information technology). It will support the \npreparation of a policy paper on key priority sectors with recommendations to support policy \nchanges and implementation. In line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, the policy papers will need to \nhighlight innovative policies and mechanisms to support the implementation of ADB\u2019s new \nproducts and modalities (e.g., quick-release project readiness financing, policy-based guarantees, \nfinancing facilities to support public\u2013private partnerships, and small expenditure financing). \n \n12.  This output will provide need-based consulting services that will respond quickly and \nflexibly to changing or unforeseen circumstances and demands, and support just-in-time and \nbest-practice knowledge products and services, as may be identified by the government and/or \nADB. Thematic training programs and technical advisors will be provided on request to key \nministries to help form relevant task forces and working groups and to provide action-oriented \npolicy advice and road maps to help implement government reforms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, facilities, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \n                                                \n4  During project and portfolio review meetings, project officers have consistently noted the drawbacks and delays that \nwere caused by the insufficient capacity and knowledge of the oversight bodies, including judicial bodies, on \nmultilateral operations, procedures, and best practices for project management and implementation. \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Economic Affairs Division (EAD), Ministry of Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs \nwill be the executing agency responsible for liaising with Pakistani authorities and providing the \nstrategic direction for TA implementation. ADB\u2019s Pakistan Resident Mission will administer the TA \nand work closely with TA beneficiaries to ensure the effective use of TA resources. ADB and the \nEAD will hold quarterly and ad hoc TA coordination meetings to review and update the TA \nimplementation status and to discuss emerging needs and opportunities for support under the TA \ntogether with the proposed work plans. All agreements reached by ADB and the EAD during the \nmeetings will be documented, with the activities updated accordingly. \n \n16.

The resource persons will include (i) an editor to refine the annual capacity \ndevelopment reports and edit knowledge products, and (ii) researchers to assist in conducting \nsurveys and other tasks. \n \n                                                \n5  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n6  The TA team will share such knowledge with the project teams and the alumni network through SharePoint and \nsimilar web-based tools or applications. \n ", "5 \n18.  The training materials and programs will have the utmost impact on the success of the TA \nand  will  be  prepared  using  carefully  analyzed  international  best  practices.  To  reduce  the \nadministrative burden and improve economy and efficiency, the capacity development training \nevents will mainly be delivered at the National School of Public Policy, Pakistan Planning & \nManagement Institute, National Institute of Banking & Finance and other public sector institutions. \nEAD will engage these institutions to host training events (including provision of selected training \ntopics  and  other  support/facilities)  as  part  of  counterpart  in-kind  contribution.  International \nconsultants and resource persons recruited separately by ADB will (i) lecture at most training \nevents, and (ii) develop training materials and train the trainers of above public sector institutions \nto support follow-on training and information sharing, which will help ensure the sustainability of \nthe intended capacity building. \n \n19.  The selection of government staff for the training programs will be done in consultation \nwith the EAD. In general, preference will be given to middle- and lower-level management for \nproject  implementation  training  programs,  and  to  senior  management  for  thematic  training \nprograms  that  deal  with  policy  issues.  Detailed  selection  criteria  will  be  developed  during \nimplementation in consultation with the EAD. \n \n20.  Consultants  will  prepare  an  annual  capacity  development  report  to  document  the \nimprovement  in  the  portfolio  performance  of  ADB-assisted  projects,  the  training  programs \nconducted, feedback from participants, best practices, and the sector and thematic knowledge \ndeveloped. The report will be published and disseminated to all stakeholders. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s  procurement.  Procurement  of  goods  and  equipment  will  follow  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The goods and equipment to be procured may \ninclude information technology equipment (such as computers, projectors, video conference \nfacilities, drones and aerial photography systems), software, accessories, and other small office \nequipment. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Pakistan  for  Capacity  Building  for  Structural  Transformation,  Country \nProgramming, and Portfolio Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with  \nDevelopment impacts of government reform initiatives and donor-supported operations delivered effectively \nand efficiently (Project defined) \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  and Reporting  Risk  \nOutcome       \nCapacity of the Government of  By 2022: at least 90% of  Government  Government and \nPakistan to define its plans  Pakistan projects kept On  notifications  other key \nand actions increased, and  Track, including newly  and/or relevant  stakeholders \noperational knowledge in  approved and effective  minutes of  change and have \nprogramming and  projects.
