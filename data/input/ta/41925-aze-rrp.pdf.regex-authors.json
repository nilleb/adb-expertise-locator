The proposed transaction will provide a dollar-denominated subordinated loan (Tier II \ncapital) of up to $10 million to Bank Respublika Open Joint-Stock Company (Bank Respublika; \nthe bank) in order to strengthen its capital position and underpin the expansion of its lending \nactivities, particularly to small and medium sized enterprises.  \n \nII.  AZERBAIJAN ECONOMY AND BANKING SECTOR BACKGROUND: \nCHALLENGES AND PROJECT RATIONALE \nA.  Azerbaijan Economy \n1.  Overview and Outlook \n2.  The rapid increase in oil production has resulted in the Azerbaijan economy posting its \nfifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a \nrecord 34.5% in real terms during 2006, which was the world\u2019s highest growth rate for the \nsecond  year  running.  By  far  the  greatest  driver  of  growth  has  been  the  industrial  sector, \nspecifically the oil and gas sector, which increased by 56% in 2006 (for a cumulative growth rate \nof 150% in 2005\u20132006). The non-oil economy has also expanded, rising by 12% in 2006; \nhowever, its contribution to GDP has fallen in the last few years as the oil sector has grown. The \nnon-oil sector was 47% of nominal GDP in 2006, down from 58% in 2005 and 61% in 2004. \nRising  oil  prices  and  export  volumes  have  contributed  to  a  significant  strengthening  of \nAzerbaijan's external position.1  \n \n3.  The medium-term outlook for the Azerbaijan economy is positive. GDP is expected to \npost double-digit growth for the next few years, in line with increases in oil and gas exports. \nHowever, foreign investment is projected to decrease as the major oil and gas projects move \ntowards less intensive stages. It is expected that domestic public investment will partially offset \nthe decline in foreign investment. Government expenditures rose by over 80% in 2006 and are \nprojected to rise by a further 50% in 2007. Partly due to the increase in government spending \nand partly the continued strong foreign exchange inflows associated with the oil and gas sector \nand robust private consumption, there will be increasing inflationary pressure. Annual inflation is \nexpected to rise from 11.4% in 2006 to over 15% in 2007.2 \n \n4.  In February 2007, Fitch Ratings upgraded the Republic of Azerbaijan's foreign and local \ncurrency issuer default ratings to BB+ from BB. Fitch Ratings noted that the country\u2019s outlook \nremained stable. Fitch Ratings\u2019 upgrade of Azerbaijan's sovereign ratings is driven by (i) strong \nand sustainable economic growth, (ii) low government and external debt ratios, and (iii) a \ngrowing current account surplus underpinned by rapidly increasing oil and gas production. In \naddition, in September 2006, Moody's Investors Service assigned a foreign and local currency \nissuer rating of Ba1 to Azerbaijan. \n \nB.  Future Challenges  \n5.  In the long term, given potential volatility in the international oil market, Azerbaijan\u2019s high \ndependence on oil exports poses a potential threat to the economy. The main challenge is to \n                                                 \n1  In 2006, Azerbaijan had a current account surplus of $3.7 billion, equivalent to 18.7% of GDP and a sharp reversal \nfrom the current account deficit of 30% of GDP recorded in 2004. \n2  As a result of the substantial increase in public spending and high demand growth, the inflation rate for the first \nquarter of 2007 was 16.6%. ", "2   \ndevelop the non-oil sector to ensure the economy continues to grow sustainably after the oil \nboom, meeting both short-term expectations and longer-term demands. A key objective is to \ndevelop income-generating and new employment opportunities in the non-oil sector in such \npriority areas as banking and finance, trade, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  \n \nC.  Banking Sector in Azerbaijan  \n1.  Overview  \n6.  The Azerbaijani banking system has shown significant improvement in key performance \nindicators since 2000, mainly due to strong growth in the economy and financial sector reform. It \nis, however, still considered one of the weakest among the sovereigns rated by Fitch Ratings.3 \nThe financial system remains small and highly concentrated. As of the beginning of 2007, the \nAzerbaijani banking system consisted of 44 commercial banks operating under license of the \nNational Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA), with total statutory capital of $693 million4 (Figure 1). \n \n7.  The Azerbaijani banking sector is almost fully privatized. The last remaining 100% state-\nowned bank (Kapital Bank) is expected to be privatized in the near future. The private banks are \nstill relatively small, with total assets of $30 million\u2013$80 million and equity of around $10 million \nfor a typical top-tier private bank. The leading private banks are generally owned by individuals \nor private business groups, and state-owned enterprises hold only small stakes (if any). In \nrecent years, a top tier of approximately 10 private banks has emerged, and these account for \nhalf of the total bank capital in the country. The remaining banks are smaller, with low levels of \ntotal assets. It is expected that there will be consolidation within the banking sector in the \nmedium term, especially since the NBA is increasing the minimum required capital. Major \ninternational banks do not have substantial operations in Azerbaijan mainly due to the small size \nof the domestic market and certain legal restrictions.  \n \n8.  While the authorities continue to improve prudential regulations, significant vulnerabilities \nin the banking system remain. In response to rising credit and foreign exchange risks, the NBA \nhas tightened the prudential rules pertaining to loan collateral and open positions in foreign \ncurrencies, and has also increased the minimum capital requirement. \n \n9.  The Heritage Foundation Banking Index5 rating of 3.5 (on a scale of 1 to 5) shows a \nrelatively restrictive environment for banks, which is reflected in the absence of any major \ninternational  bank  operating  in  the  country.  However,  this  result  is  similar  to  the  average \nbanking index score of 3.73 for ADF borrowing countries. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Fitch Ratings. 2007.

This consisted \nof 94 nonbanking organizations (77 credit unions and 17 microfinance institutions funded mainly by international \naid organizations) and 44 commercial banks. \n5 Heritage Foundation. 2006.

Detailed Analysis \n10.  The depth of bank intermediation activity is low (system assets were equivalent to only \n17% of GDP as of the end of 2006). The provision of financial services to households and the \nprivate sector is very limited (only an estimated 10% of the total population has bank accounts), \nreflecting low confidence in the banking sector. Financial services have mainly been provided to \nthe  oil,  construction,  and  trade  sectors,  leaving  the  retail  and  SME  sectors  notably \nunderserviced. \n \n11.  The  banking  system\u2019s  assets  (the  main  pillar  of  the  Azerbaijan  financial  system) \nrepresented only 21% of GDP in 2006, significantly below the ratios for Russia (53%) and \nKazakhstan (91%). As of the end of 2006, the total volume of assets grew by almost 60% and \namounted to $4,344 million. The most significant element in the structure of bank assets are \nloans issued to customers, which total $2,537 million (58.4% of total assets). Half of the total \nbanking assets in the country are held by the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2: Share of Banks\u2019 Assets \n(as of 1 January 2007) \nIBA\n22%\nBank Standard\nKapital\nUnibank\n2% Texnikabank\n2% Azerigazbank\n52%\n2% Respublika\n3%\nBank of Baku\n3%\nKochbank\n3%\nAzerdemiryolbank\n3%\n4% Other\n4%\n \nIBA = International Bank of Azerbaijan. \nSource: International Bank of Azerbaijan, JP Morgan. \n ", "4   \n12.  On the liability side, the most significant element comprises deposits issued to corporate \nand individual customers, which total $2,253 million (64.23% of total liabilities). Banking sector \ndeposits have grown rapidly but remain low, and are not commensurate with Azerbaijan\u2019s level \nof  development.  According  to  NBA,  deposits  rose  by  50%  in  2006  to  AZN2.0  billion,  an \nestimated 11% of GDP.  \n \n13.  The use of dollars in the economy remains high, with the share of savings in foreign \ncurrency as at the end of 2006 being more than 50%, and the volume of lending in foreign \ncurrency being 53%. The share of deposits held in Azerbaijan new manats has, however, \nincreased notably during 2006, at least in part because of the appreciation of the local currency \nagainst the dollar. By November 2006, 37% of total deposits were held in Azerbaijan new \nmanats, up from just 20% at the end of 2005. \n \n14.  Azerbaijan\u2019s commercial banks have used the rapidly growing deposit base to expand \ntheir  loan  portfolios\u2014an  important  and  positive  development  given  the  marginal  financial \nintermediation role that they have played in the economy up until now. As of December 2006, \nconsolidated lending by banks was AZN2.36 billion, up 64% from the previous year. By April \n2007, this figure reached AZN2.87 billion. Despite the large increase in the deposit base, this \nfigure is still too small to meet the growing demand for financial services, especially from SMEs.  \n \n15.  The private and state-owned commercial banks each provide about 48% of total loans \noutstanding, with the remainder coming from nonbank institutions. However, most private banks \nfocus exclusively on lending to the private sector\u2014primarily individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. \nBy virtue of their small size and customer focus, the private banks provide mainly small and \nmicro loans and typically do not serve the oil and gas sector. \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Share of Banks\u2019 Loans \n(as of 1 January 2007) \nIBA\n25% Texnikabank\nUnibank\nKapital\nBank Standard\n50% Azerigazbank\n2%\nRespublika\n2%\n2% Bank of Baku\n3% Azerdemiryolbank\n3% Turnabank\n3%\nOther\n3%\n3%\n4%\n \nIBA = International Bank of Azerbaijan. \nSource: International Bank of Azerbaijan, JP Morgan. \n \n \n16.  The share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and the level of capital at risk are moderate. \nAccording to national statistics, the share of NPLs in 2006 was considerably low at 3.33%, \ncompared to 4.73% in the previous year. However, the European Bank for Reconstruction and ", "  5\nDevelopment\u2019s (EBRD) Transition Report 20066 noted that the level of NPLs in the entire \nbanking system should have been 14.9% in 2005, 0.4% higher than 2004. Of particular concern \nin the banking system is the ratio and quality of capitalization, particularly as credit continues to \ngrow rapidly. In response to this, the authorities have worked to improve the supervision of the \nbanking system. Minimum capital requirements will be raised from the current level of AZN8.2 \nmillion  to  AZN10.0  million  by  July  2008,  and  this  is  expected  to  translate  into  further \nconsolidation and mergers, resulting in fewer and better-capitalized banks. This is a positive \nstep towards strengthening the financial system in Azerbaijan. Currently, only 10 of Azerbaijan\u2019s \n44 banks have capital of AZN10.0 million or more.   \n \n17.  The financial condition of Azerbaijani banks remains stable while displaying positive \ndynamics. Based on the results of 2006, the average return on equity of Azerbaijani banks was \napproximately 30%, and the return on assets was 2%. As oil prices remain high and new \ninvestment comes to Azerbaijan, interest rates are set to decrease. As interest rates decrease \nand  the  economy  grows,  the  banking  sector  is  almost  certainly  set  for  further  expansion. \nMoreover, as the domestic economy is growing at an annual rate of 10% in real terms, there will \nbe more investment opportunities in areas like hotels and tourism, retail, catering, and real \nestate.  Construction  related  to  the  oil  industry  also  stimulates  some  sectors,  such  as \ntransportation,  engineering,  and  the  steel  industry.  In  fact,  even  without  any  structural \nimprovement, the banking sector may show quite good growth (comparable to GDP growth). \nStructural improvement may give a much more significant boost to the banking sector, and the \npace of growth will be determined by the success of structural reforms. Appendix 1 gives an \noverview of the development of the Azerbaijani banking sector. \n \n3.  Outlook \n18.  Despite  substantial  support  to  banks  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  most \nprivate banks are expected to remain illiquid and undercapitalized in the medium term. State-\nowned  banks  will  continue  to  dominate  the  sector,  which,  together  with  continued  strong \neconomic growth, will ensure that the risk of a banking crisis is low. Structural changes in the \nbanking  sector  will  foster  further  consolidation  and  greater  foreign  participation.  The  new \nbanking  system  and  central  bank  laws  have  significantly  strengthened  the  banking  sector \nlegislation. The authorities are confident that this will provide the basis for improving the quality \nof  the  financial  sector  in  Azerbaijan,  especially  with  the  strengthening  of  the  supervisory \nframework. Furthermore, the Government is developing banking infrastructure to make it better \nsuited  to  channeling  savings  into  the  economy.  The  Government  and  NBA  have  issued \nprudential regulations conforming to best international practices, including risk-based capital, \nloan loss provisioning, and asset classification regulations. For more details refer to Appendix 2. \n   \nD.  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Azerbaijan \n1.  Private Sector Development \n19.  Between 1995 and 2006 the privatization of state-owned property and the creation of \nnew businesses greatly contributed to the development of the private sector in Azerbaijan. As of \n1 January 2007, the number of registered legal entities was 74,354, 80.6% of which were \nprivate  enterprises.  As  of  March  2007,  there  are  4,161  foreign  legal  entities  registered  in \nAzerbaijan. \n \n                                                 \n6 EBRD. 2006. Transitions Report 2006. London. \n ", "6   \n20.  In 2006, the share of the private sector in GDP was about 81%. Private firms are the \nmajor  source  of  employment  and  Government  revenue.  Presently,  the  share  of  the \nnongovernment sector in the manufacturing and service areas such as agriculture, industry, \ntrade, hotels, catering services, civic construction, transport, and communication is in the range \nof 70\u201395%. \n \n2.  Constitution of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n21.  The  development  of  SMEs  is  crucial  to  the  development  of  the  non-oil  sector  in \nAzerbaijan. As a result of structural reforms and improvements in legislation and taxation, the \nnumber of entrepreneurs has increased considerably in the past 10 years. In 2006, there were \n243,473 people registered as individual entrepreneurs. They are involved in fields such as trade \n(49.4%), transport, storage, and telecommunications (17.9%), agriculture (9.5%), public and \nsocial  services  (8.2%)  and  real  estate  operations  (5.9%).  SMEs  currently  account  for \napproximately 80% of registered private businesses operating in Azerbaijan, and over the past 5 \nyears have, on average, represented an estimated 10% of GDP. SMEs are the largest source of \ndomestic employment outside of the public sector, providing a livelihood for over 75% of the \ncountry\u2019s  workforce.  An  estimated  70%  of  SMEs  are  located  in  Baku  and  the  Absheron \nPeninsula, and have limited capacity for regional expansion.   \n \n22.  The importance of SMEs in relation to general economic vitality is widely acknowledged. \nStudies have shown that in most countries the SME and the informal sector account for about \n45\u201375% of employment and 65\u201370% of GDP, regardless of the development stage of the \neconomy.7 This is especially true for Azerbaijan, as explained in the preceding paragraph.   \n \n23.  Further efforts are therefore needed to develop the SME sector. One of the biggest \nproblems facing SMEs in Azerbaijan today is the lack of access to finance. This problem has \nbeen identified and recognized by both the Government and the donor community. \n \n3.  Government Efforts \n24.  The  Government  continues  to  support  SME  growth  and  improve  the  business \nenvironment. In the past 2 years, state policy has shifted from providing direct aid to SMEs to \nimproving the regulatory and business infrastructure in order to facilitate the development of the \nprivate sector. In consultation with the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business team, the Government has \nidentified a list of urgent measures and actions necessary to simplify business regulations in the \ncountry.  \n \n25.  In 2005, the Government completed the 2-year state program for SME development. \nThe major objectives of the program were (i) the creation and development of legal and physical \ninfrastructures for efficient operation of SMEs, (ii) the expansion of foreign economic activity of \nSMEs and export promotion, and (iii) the expansion of opportunities for financial and investment \nassistance for SMEs.  \n \n26.  To help alleviate the problem of lack of financing faced by SMEs, the Government \nestablished a special state budget fund for SME development, supervised by the Ministry of \nEconomic Development. The fund is expected to disburse a total of $94 million in 2007 for \nvarious SME projects via 25 private bank agents, one nonbank institution and five credit unions. \n                                                 \n7 Corporation for Enterprise Development. 2004. SMEs and Poverty Reduction. New York. The report, commissioned \nby the Ford Foundation's Affinity Group on Development Finance (SME committee), reviews current literature on \nthe SME sector and its links to poverty reduction strategies in the United States and internationally. ", "  7\nWhile the loan size varies from $50,000 to $1 million, the annual interest rate is limited to 7% \n(market rates are in the 15\u201320% range). However, the Ministry of Economic Development \nrecognizes that the fund should not be a continuing source of subsidized financing for SMEs \nand that private banks have to actively become involved. The private banks are asked to \nactively look for external funding sources in order to reduce the market lending rates. Before \nyear-end 2007, the Ministry of Economic Development is expected to revise the charter of the \nbudget fund in accordance with a new draft of the second state program on SME development \nto be approved in early 2008. Further, in May 2007, the president issued a special decree aimed \nat  accelerating  SME  development  in  Azerbaijan.  According  to  the  decree,  development  of \nentrepreneurship requires new measures to reduce impediments, such as changing the time-\nconsuming  registration  procedures  and  licensing.  The  cabinet  of  ministers  and  other  line \nagencies have been authorized to prepare and submit to the president their suggestions for (i) \nthe elimination of abuses, (ii) the acceleration of entrepreneurial development, and (iii) the \ncreation of an advantageous business environment.  \n \nIII.  THE BORROWER \nA.  Overview \n27.  Bank Respublika, headquartered in Baku, was established as a joint-stock company in \n1992 by a group of entrepreneurs led by Natig Gouliyev. The bank operates under a general \nbanking license, although the scope of its activities has been upgraded in two instances: (i) in \n1994 the bank received approval to commence foreign exchange operations; and (ii) in 1999 the \nbank  was  authorized  to  issue  credit  cards.  Throughout  the  early  and  mid-1990s,  Bank \nRespublika\u2019s  principal  focus  was  on  corporate  banking,  providing  services  to  businesses, \nseveral of which were related parties. Following the turmoil of the Russian financial crisis in \n1998, however, Bank Respublika has repositioned itself as a universal bank expanding into the \nretail market, specifically targeting the consumer banking needs of the middle class, in addition \nto servicing the corporate needs of the SME sector.  \n \n28.  Under  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  as  of  the  end  of  2006  Bank \nRespublika reported total assets of AZN111.3 million and shareholder equity of AZN11.9 million. \nThe bank has increased its market share in the Azerbaijan banking system from 2.5% in 2005 to \n2.95% at the end of 2006 (3.2% as of 1 May 2007). It ranks 5th among the private sector banks \nin the country in terms of assets and is among the top 10 banks by deposits and loans \n(Appendix 3 gives a detailed peer analysis).  \n \n29.  As a means of strengthening its position in the market, Bank Respublika has forged \nrelationships with several international financial institutions. In January 2002, the bank began \nparticipating in the German-Azerbaijan Fund, with a \u20ac2 million credit line for SMEs. In addition, \nBank  Respublika  received  extended  technical  assistance  under  the  Retail  Banking \nDevelopment  Project  in  mid-2002  from  the  Savings  Banks  Foundation  for  International \nCooperation. In 2004, Bank Respublika became involved in the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(KfW)-funded Corporate Standards Implementation project. Bank Respublika\u2019s relationship with \nKfW  deepened  with  the  sale  of  a  16.67%  equity  interest  to  Deutsche  Investitions-  und \nEntwicklungsgesellshaft mbH (DEG, a member of the KfW banking group) and of 8.33% to \nSparkassen International Development Trust in early 2005. \n \n30.  Bank Respublika received its initial credit rating from Moody\u2019s Investors Services in \nDecember 2006. The assessed rating was B2 (foreign currency deposit rating) with a positive \noutlook (upgraded in June 2007), and this was the highest rating among the private sector \n ", "8   \nbanks  in  Azerbaijan.  Moody\u2019s  indicated  that  its  rating  reflected  Bank  Respublika\u2019s  (i) \nstrengthening franchise in the country\u2019s banking market and its ability to increase its market \nshare  while  maintaining  rigid  credit  underwriting  procedures,  supported  by  a  dedicated \nmanagement  team;  (ii)  access  to  wholesale  funding  from  foreign  banks;  (iii) strategic \nrepositioning to focus on retail and SME banking activities; (iv) relatively good loan granularity or \ndiversification; and (v) equity partnership with two German public sector financial institutions \nwhich has a positive influence on corporate governance, systems, and controls. \n \nB.  Business Strategy: Retail and Small and Medium-Enterprise Focus \n31.  For several years after its founding, Bank Respublika focused on corporate banking. \nHowever, in the late 1990s, after surviving the turmoil of the Russian financial crisis, the bank \nbegan shifting its strategy. To better position itself, Bank Respublika sought transition into a \nuniversal bank, offering retail banking services and expanding its corporate banking activities, \nspecifically its SME portfolio. As part of this transition process, the bank has expanded its \ndistribution network  to  12  branches  and  seven  service  points  throughout  the  country  (five \nadditional branches are to be opened in the second half of 2007) and broadened the types of \nproducts that it offers to service consumer needs.  \n \n32.  Bank Respublika currently offers eight different types of loans. Retail banking products \ninclude car, new family, useful trip, education, and mortgage loans. SME and corporate banking \nproducts are categorized by size as follows: (i) micro loans from AZN300 to AZN10,000, (ii) \nSME loans from AZN10,000 to AZN500,000, and (iii) macro loans over AZN500,000. Appendix \n6 gives an overview over the various loan products. \n \n33.  Going  forward,  Bank  Respublika  seeks  to  build  on  its  presence  in  the  Azerbaijan \nbanking sector and gain market share in retail and SME banking. In addition to conducting an \naggressive  marketing  campaign  to  strengthen  brand-name  recognition  and  attract  new \ndepositors  and  borrowers,  the  bank  also  seeks  to  improve  customer  service  to  develop \ncustomer loyalty, as well as offer other loan products tailored to customer needs.  \n \n34.  Bank  Respublika\u2019s  focus  on  SME  and  retail  lending  offers  good  opportunities  for \nsustainable growth, as both sectors are currently underdeveloped in Azerbaijan. Further, this \nbusiness focus avoids excessive concentrations, to which many of the other small banks in the \ncountry are prone. \n \nIV.  PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  Overview \n35.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to Bank Respublika will be in the form of a US dollar \ndenominated subordinated loan of up to $10 million in order to strengthen the bank\u2019s capital \nposition  and  underpin  the  expansion  of  its  lending  activities,  particularly  to  SMEs.  The \nsubordinated loan will be structured in a way to qualify as Tier II capital. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  9\nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS \nA.  Justification for the ADB Investment \n1.  Development Outcome \n36.  The proposed ADB assistance will promote development in the following key areas. \n \n(i)  Increase  access  to  finance  for  SMEs. SMEs play a significant role in the \neconomies of all ADB developing member countries (DMCs) and are key drivers \nof  employment,  economic  growth,  and  development.  They  often  have  a \nsignificant impact on GDP, and in most cases grow faster than state-owned \nenterprises. The development of SMEs is therefore an important driver of growth \nand  a  key  contributor  to  poverty  reduction  by  (a)  creating  employment,  (b) \nincreasing individual incomes, and (c) generating tax revenues. \n \nSMEs  rely  heavily  on  access  to  external  capital  to  finance  their  operations. \nHowever, in most ADB DMCs, SMEs have difficulty accessing financial services \nand securing financing. Although bank loans dominate external financing (due to \nthe underdeveloped corporate bond markets), only a small number of SMEs in \nthe region have access to bank lending (mostly only for working capital). In most \nDMCs  the  lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is  considered  the  main  financing \ndifficulty and hindrance to sustaining growth of SMEs.8 This is no different in \nAzerbaijan, as discussed in Section II. SME development is key to the country\u2019s \nfuture development and economic diversification.  \n \nThe  proposed  assistance  will  allow  Bank  Respublika  to  provide  increased \nfinancial intermediation in line with its strategic plan. The increased availability of \ncapital or funding will help clients promote their operations, increase profitability, \nand  enhance  their  competitiveness,  thus  contributing  to  private  sector \ndevelopment and sustainable economic growth in Azerbaijan.   \n \n(ii)  Promote  development  in  the  non-oil  sector.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy  is \ndominated by the oil sector and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable \nfuture. In the absence of further oil discoveries, the country\u2019s oil wealth is set to \npeak relatively early. As such, diversification of the economic base will become \nan increasingly important means of sustaining growth and reducing the country\u2019s \nvulnerability to a sustained fall in oil prices. The proposed transaction, which will \nindirectly lead to increased lending to SMEs that are presently underserviced, will \nsupport the creation of employment and livelihood opportunities for a broader \nportion of the population outside the oil and gas sector.   \n \n(iii)  Support the emerging private banking sector. The proposed intervention will \nhelp strengthen the banking sector at a critical point in its development and \nenhance confidence in the county\u2019s banking system. The private banking sector \nis small and underdeveloped and not fully able to mobilize available liquidity and \nchannel it towards SME investment through extension of credit. Support for the \ngrowth of a promising and well-managed private bank will contribute to the shift \n                                                 \n8 Appendix 14 discusses the development impact of SME finance and Appendix 15 discuss the SME financing gap in \nAsia. \n ", "10  \naway from the state-owned banks\u2019 dominance of the sector. As private banks are \na  key  source  of  small  and  micro  loans  for  the  private  sector  (particularly \nindividual entrepreneurs and SMEs), they are critical to the economy.    \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB \n37.  The proposed loan from ADB will allow Bank Respublika to strengthen its capital base \nand this will in turn enhance the bank\u2019s ability to expand its lending activities, providing greater \nfinancing intermediation in Azerbaijan, especially to SMEs.   \n \n38.  In addition, ADB will strengthen its relationship with Bank Respublika, and in doing so \nencourage and support the adoption of better practices (through covenants) for critical banking \nfunctions (such as credit, asset-liability management, anti-money laundering, anticorruption, and \nenvironmental safeguard policies and procedures).  \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n39.  The proposed loan will be classified as category FI (financial intermediary) under ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of ADB\u2019s existing senior loan \nto Bank Respublika, the bank has issued an environmental and social policy in 2007 and \ndeveloped  and  implemented  detailed  environmental  management  procedures  which  are \nacceptable to ADB (a short summary appears in Appendix 17). ADB will be furnished with an \nannual  environmental  and  social  report,  which  will  document  the  compliance  with  ADB's \nsafeguard policies. Bank Respublika has the capacity to run the procedures put in place. The \nproposed loan will be classified category C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), as no involuntary resettlements or adverse impacts \non indigenous peoples are foreseen in relation to any activities of Bank Respublika.  \n \nD.  Anticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism  \n40.  Bank Respublika has been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require Bank Respublika, through covenants in the loan documentation, to institute, \nmaintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best-practice \nstandards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the \nfinancing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \nBank  Respublika  has  adequate  anti-money  laundering  and  anti-financing  of  terrorism \nprocedures in place. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n41.  ADB will enter into an acceptable loan agreement and other required legal documents, \nfollowing approval of the proposed loan by the Board. These agreements will be on terms and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n42.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be asked to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed ADB loan to Bank \nRespublika.  No  funding  under  the  loan  will  be  made  available  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation. ", "  11\n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed subordinated loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve a \nUS dollar-denominated subordinated loan of up to $10,000,000 to Bank Respublika Open Joint \nStock Company in order to strengthen its capital position and underpin the expansion of its \nlending activities, particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises.  \n \n \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n \n \n12 October 2007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nHISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF BANKING SECTOR IN AZERBAIJAN \nA.  Historic Overview \n \n1.  Institutional and legal establishment of the banking system of the Republic of Azerbaijan \nbegan after independence in 1991. The basic objectives of the development stage of the bank \nsystem  were  to  establish  the  institutions  and  infrastructure  and  provide  for  the  normal \nfunctioning of the banking system. \n \n2.  Adoption of the Law on the National Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic (NBA) and the Law \non Banks and Banking Activity in the Azerbaijan Republic laid foundation for the legal-normative \nbasis of the banking system. The initial stage of the banking system was accompanied by liberal \nconditions of entry into the banking market. With the objectives of stimulating the process of \ninstitutional establishment of the bank system, the NBA made minimal capital requirements and \nused relatively soft control mechanisms. As a result of those processes, 233 banks and 370 \nbank branches were registered and operated during 1993-1994 in Azerbaijan. \n \n3.  The evolution stage of the banking system, which began in 1996, established new \npriorities by taking into account completion of the institutional establishment of the banking \nsystem. Administrative means, which were used by the NBA for regulation of bank sector, were \ngradually  replaced  by  prudent  supervision.  Measures  were  taken  on  international \nstandardization of the normative legal basis, which regulated banking activity and the economic \nnormative requirements were continuously tightened.  \n \n4.  As a result of the strengthening of the banking system, protection of depositors\u2019 interests, \npromotion  of  sound  competition,  quantitative  parameters  were  transformed  to  qualitative \nparameters. Special attention was paid to financial indicators of banks, i.e., capital, liquidity, \nprofitability,  security  of  transactions,  use  of  progressive  technological  processes  and \nmanagement-information systems. \n \n5.  Consolidation of the banking system, development of banks and strengthening of their \ncapitalization resulted in an increase of aggregate bank capital by 22 times, total investment by \n3 times, and the amount of attracted savings increased by 8 times. The weight of bank assets in \nGDP has now reached 28%. \n \n6.  At this stage of development of the banking system, in order to restructure the state \nbanks, the capital of banks was incorporated and the share of the state in the banking system \nas a proprietor was reduced. Twinning Programs with foreign banks were carried out to prepare \nstate banks for privatization and institutional development.  \n \n7.  The objective of increasing institutional variety on the legal basis of non-bank credit \norganizations was established in 1998. The number of such financial entities was 13 in 1998 \nand reached 82 in 2001. The next stage of historical evolution of the banking system, i.e. \nintensive restructuring and recovery of the banking system, started in 2000. Recovery measures \nwere aimed at the establishment of a banking system that was adequately capitalized with \nsound, sufficient management systems. To establish precise efficiency parameters, audits were \ncarried  out  to  evaluate  financial  condition,  capitalization,  liquidity,  profitability  management \nmechanisms and systems, in-house procedures and other aspects. Furthermore, raising the \nefficiency of bank services, improvement of management-information systems, and application \nof new bank technologies was supported. These measures fully embraced the private banking \nsector. ", "  Appendix 1    13 \n \n8.  Restructuring and recovery of the banking system were carried out in two systems, i.e. \nrestructuring  of  state  banks  and  the  private  banking  system.  In  the  process,  Industrial-\nInvestment Bank, Savings Banks and Agrarian-Industrial Bank were merged and BUS Bank \nwas established. In addition, in July 2002, Mbank and Promtekhbank announced their merger to \ncreate Unibank, Azerbaijan\u2019s third largest bank by assets. \n \n9.  Other state bank structures were consolidated into the Agrarian-Industrial Bank. The \nAgrarian-Industrial Bank was transformed into a non-bank credit organization acting under a \nlimited license to regulate bad debts and, thereby, solve the problem of low quality assets \ninherent in post-soviet states. \n \nB.       Role and Regulations of the National Bank of Azerbaijan \n10.  As early as 7 August 1992, in addition to the Law on Banks and Banking Activity in the \nAzerbaijan Republic, the Law on the National Bank of Azerbaijan was adopted. On 15 August \n1992, the manat, the national currency of the Azerbaijan Republic, was issued. On 1 December \n1992, the Milli Mejis of the Azerbaijan Republic passed the Resolution on Approval of the \nCharter of the NBA. The aforesaid legislative acts established the NBA as the supreme state \nbank, which has exclusive right to issue banknotes and carry out reserve system functions. At \nthe same time, the NBA was granted regulatory and supervisory authority over the banking \nsystem. The NBA is the central bank of the Azerbaijan Republic. Its status, basic functions and \nduties,  organization  and  principles  of  activity  are  determined  by  the  Constitution  of  the \nAzerbaijan Republic, Law on the National Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic and other legislative \nacts. \n \n11.  The basic objectives of the NBA are to ensure manat stability, to take measures to \nregulate  its  purchasing  power  and  exchange  rate  versus  foreign  currency,  to  determine \nmonetary and credit policy; to carry out cash emission; to pay off state debts in accordance with \nthe current laws of Azerbaijan; to participate in the preparation of balance of payments forecasts \nand to draw up balanced payment reports of Azerbaijan. \n \n12.  The main functions of the NBA are pursuing state policy in the sphere of monetary, \ncredit and currency relations; facilitating accomplishment of settlements and stable operation of \nthe payment system; accomplishing transactions in the securities market, as well as purchase \nand sale of foreign currency; taking necessary measures for development and strengthening of \nthe banking system in Azerbaijan; carrying out currency regulation, determining procedures for \nsettlements with foreign countries and managing foreign currency reserves; adopting normative \nacts in the field of banking activity. \n \n13.  The NBA has in recent years successfully used the exchange rate of the manat to help \nanchor domestic price levels contributing to low inflation, increasing international reserves and \ngrowing external competitiveness, as reflected in the rapid growth of non-oil exports in recent \nyears. It also plans to continue to follow carefully the developments in the domestic market. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "14      Appendix 2 \nBANKING SECTOR OUTLOOK \n \n1.  It is forecasted that the asset growth trend in Azerbaijan during the next few years will \nexceed  the  pace  of  previous  years.  The  National  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  (NBA)  expects \nimprovements of banking indicators and bank performance. Banks will continue to increase their \ncapital,  further  attract  foreign  investments,  improve  risk  management,  increase profitability, \nefficiency and asset quality. \n \n2.  The  process  of  revising  the  legislative  framework  of  the  Azeri  banking  system  will \ncontinue. New legislation will foster banking sector development, strengthen banks\u2019 corporate \ngovernance  provide  a  new  framework  for  mortgage  lending,  bolster  the  central  bank\u2019s \nsupervisory control, improve the ability to fight money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, \nstrengthen  the  NBA\u2019s  independence  in  the  formulation  and  execution  of  monetary  policy, \nimprove the accountability of the NBA and enhanced its transparency by establishing a clear \nmechanism for distributing NBA\u2019s profit.  \n \n3.  Additionally, NBA started redenomination of the manat, from 1 January 2006 the value of \nthe manat has increased by a factor of 5,000. Six new banknotes and 5 types of coins have \nbeen issued. According to NBA, the main reason behind redenomination is preventing further \ndollarization of the economy since the nominal exchange rate is now close to the current US \ndollar rate. Furthermore, the redenomination plays a vital role in strengthening the national \ncurrency and simplifying arithmetical calculations during trade operations and it will also ease \nthe work of banks. Currently, the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA) stands as the largest \nbank  with  the  largest  number  of  current  accounts  of  physical  customers.  Therefore,  the \nresponsibility of IBA in the process of re-denomination is significant.  \n \n4.  On  15  April  2005,  the  Mortgage  Law  was  adopted.  As  of  1  March  2006,  the  first \napplications for mortgage loans were submitted by the authorized banks and a number of them \nhave already granted mortgages to individuals. During 2005 regulations concerning corporate \ngovernance were adopted by NBA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3   15 \n \nTOP 10 PRIVATE BANKS IN AZERBAIJAN AND BANK RESPUBLIKA\u2019S RANKING \n \n \nTable A3.1: Bank Respublika\u2019s Ranking Among Private Banks  \n(as of 31 December 2006) \n \nValue \nItem     Rank  (ANZ million) \n              \nTotal Assets    5  111,266  \nTotal Credit Portfolio  4                75,428  \nTotal Individual  Deposits  9                59,368  \nTotal Capital    9  11,906                \nNet Profit    5                  2,346  \nReturn on Assets    14          .99% \nSource: Consulting and Business. 2007.

Growth  and  modernization  in  the  SME  sector  is  often  associated  with  successful \neconomic  development,  particularly  in  low-income  countries.    In  turn,  such  growth  and \nmodernization are associated with general poverty reduction.  SMEs play a crucial role in driving \neconomic growth in both developing and developed countries.  SMEs typically generate the \nmost new jobs; introduce locally (and sometimes globally) relevant innovative ideas, products, \nand business methods; and can push economic reform and the modernization of uncompetitive \neconomies. \n \n2.  SME  development  is  also  often  seen  as  a  critical  component  of  pro-poor  growth \nstrategies: \n \n(i)  SMEs generate many of the new jobs in the economy.  Since many of these jobs \nare suitable for semi-skilled or unskilled workers, they can be taken up by the \npoor. \n \n(ii)  SMEs introduce business methods, products, and services that help restructure \nweak agricultural sector or other uncompetitive transition economies, thereby \nabsorbing labor that would otherwise drop into the ranks of the poor. \n \n(iii)  SMEs help spread the benefits of economic growth by engaging low-income \ngroups  in  national  development.    They  form  dynamic  supply-chain  linkages \nbetween small-scale producers and lucrative urban, national, or export markets.  \nIn the reverse direction, they link large urban business with mass consumer \nmarkets in remote areas. \n \n3.  The following are the effects of SMEs on poverty: \n \n(i)   Removal of bias against labor-intensive production. The removal of market \ndistortions that lead to a bias against labor-intensive production techniques \nshould have a clearly positive impact in reducing poverty. Moreover, reducing \npoverty may improve the environment for SME expansion, so that these efforts \ncan be expected to be mutually reinforcing. And although the expansion of \nSMEs may not be sufficient for poverty reduction, the likely positive effects \nthrough the families of the SMEs' employees, the better utilization of more \ngeneral aid-donor interventions across firms, and the resulting acceleration of \nhuman and community development, make it plausible to suppose that there is \nan enormous \"bang for the buck\" in fighting poverty through investing in SMEs. \n \n(ii)   The effect of employing relatively more low skilled workers. Since it is likely \nthat both SMEs and their suppliers, on average, employ a greater share' of \nlocal, low skilled workers than do large firms or the suppliers to large firms, \nand since to the extent that SMEs' hire less skilled workers, these workers \nplausibly spend a larger share of their income on other products produced by \nless skilled workers, there is more likely to be a positive multiplier effect on the \nalleviation of poverty through SME support than through development projects \nthat lack this focus. \n \n                                                 \n1 The Development Impact of Small and Medium Enterprises: Lessons Learned from SEAF Investments. Volume 1. \n ", "18      Appendix 4 \n(iii)   Linkage to small suppliers. It is plausible that SMEs have more supply links \nthan  large  firms  to  the  local  economy,  given  their  small  size  or  lesser \nsophistication, which would generally inhibit sourcing directly from abroad. \nSMEs probably import fewer intermediate goods than large firms, suggesting \na larger local multiplier effect. It is also a reasonable hypothesis that SMEs \nbuy a greater percentage of these products from labor-intensive SMEs. This in \nturn should lead to a greater expansion of sustainable, local, employment \nbenefits. \n \n(iv)   Security of employment. When employees leave micro-enterprises to accept \nSME employment, their wage incomes are likely to rise, but also to become \nless variable, making it easier to plan for their families' welfare. \n \n(v)  Impact on children through employment of mothers. If investment in an SME \nraises the incomes of poor mothers with small children, the impact on poverty \ncan be great. The development microeconomics literature consistently shows \nthat a much larger fraction of an extra dollar earned by a mother goes to the \nwelfare of her children than of an extra dollar earned by the father. This holds \nfor spending on children's health and education, as well as on improvements in \nthe home and other important factors. The impact is especially significant for \ndaughters. Though no \n(vi)   Magnified impact on poverty reduction among very poor people. Targeting \na small number of very poor people provides greater social benefits than \ntargeting a larger number of less poor people. Thus, to the degree that SMEs \nhire  relatively  poor  people,  the  impact  of  any  given  income  increase  on \npoverty would be magnified. Given the correlation between wage level and \nskill level, the tendency of SMEs to hire more unskilled people than do larger \nenterprises suggests that this magnified impact is likely at the SME level. \n \n(vii)   SME tax payments. To the extent that tax revenues are used to implement \npoverty impacting programs such as local infrastructure improvements, health \nservices, or. school meals, and to the extent that SMEs contribute more tax \nrevenue than do micro-enterprises (who in practice may pay few or no taxes) or \nlarge firms (which can often find loopholes or use their influence to pay less \nthan statutory tax rates), support to SMEs could be expected to have a greater \nindirect  impact  on  poverty  reduction  than  other  forms  of  developmental \nassistance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080429111629+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080429151456+08'00'", "Title": "Bank Respublika Open Joint Stock Company"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2007) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Azerbaijan new manat (AZN) \n \nAZN1.00 =  $1.0953   \n$1.00 =  AZN0.9147   \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n    ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nDEG  \u2013  Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellshaft mbH \nDMC  \u2013  developing member country \nGDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \nKfW  \u2013  Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \nNBA  \u2013  National Bank of Azerbaijan \nNPL  \u2013  nonperforming loan \nSME  \u2013  small and medium-sized enterprise \n     \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n \n   \nVice President  L.
