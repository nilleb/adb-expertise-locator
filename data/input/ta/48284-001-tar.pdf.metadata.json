INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines requested support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to strengthen the capacity of the Department of Education (DepEd) by assisting in the \nimplementation of the Senior High School Support Program (SHSSP), which was approved by \nADB in December 2014.1 The proposal was discussed in detail with the government during an \nADB  mission  in  June  and  July  2015.  At  the  conclusion  of  that  mission,  the  government \nconcurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  proposed  capacity  development  technical \nassistance (TA). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As prescribed by the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, DepEd will launch, in June \n2016, a new level of basic education consisting of grades 11 and 12\u2014senior high school \n(SHS).3 In December 2014, ADB approved the SHSSP, a $300 million results-based lending \n(RBL) program to support the establishment and implementation of SHS during 2014\u2013-2019, as \npart of the government\u2019s kindergarten to grade 12 (K to 12) education reform program. The \nSHSSP supports four results areas with loan disbursements tied to the achievement of six \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). Two of the results areas supported by the SHSSP are the \nestablishment of an SHS voucher program for graduates of public, and some private, junior high \nschools (JHSs) to attend private SHSs, and assessing the feasibility of using public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) for the delivery of some SHS infrastructure.  \n \n3.  The Philippines has long used financing public-private partnerships at the JHS level, and \nthe education act expands this to grades 11 and 12. Introduction of the SHS voucher program \nwill provide students from families at all income levels with a choice of attending either a DepEd \n(i.e., public) or non-DepEd SHS. It will also help to increase the quality and efficiency of SHS \ndelivery  and  will  allow  the  government  to  make  use  of  the  extensive  network  of  private \neducation providers that exists in the Philippines. The government expects that 30%\u201340% of \nSHS enrollments\u2014around 800,000 grade 11 and 12 students\u2014will be subsidized to attend non-\nDepEd SHSs, which include public and private universities, colleges, and technical-vocational \ninstitutes  offering  SHS  programs.4 The  SHS  voucher  program  design  is  aligned  with  the \nExpanded Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education Act.5  \n \n4.  One  of  the  current  programs  under  this  expanded  act  is  the  education  service \ncontracting (ESC) program, which provides subsidies to JHS students who attend non-DepEd \nJHSs in areas where DepEd JHSs are overcrowded. ESC will continue to operate at the JHS \nlevel after the new SHS voucher program takes effect. ESC is managed under contract to \nDepEd by the Fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE), a nongovernment organization. \nFAPE will also operate the SHS voucher program on behalf of DepEd. A dedicated technical \nunit  is  needed  to  mainstream  and  strengthen  DepEd\u2019s  SHS  voucher  and  ESC  program \nimplementation and oversight functions. At present, there is no dedicated unit within DepEd with \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

The  Office  of  the  Secretary  currently  oversees  the  contract  with  FAPE  for  the \nimplementation of ESC. \n \n5.  The government is also committed to assessing the feasibility of making further use of \ninfrastructure PPPs to deliver the estimated 30,000 additional classrooms that will be required \nby 2016. Such PPPs can provide a vehicle for more timely delivery and improved value for \nmoney  in  the  development  of  SHS  infrastructure.  In  addition,  infrastructure  PPPs  provide \nincreased incentives for higher standards of construction and improved maintenance of SHSs. \nSince 2011, approximately 9,300 primary school classrooms have been constructed under the \nfirst phase of the PPP for School Infrastructure Project. An additional 4,370 classrooms are \ntargeted for construction under the second phase of this project. In 2014, DepEd undertook a \npre-feasibility study of the use of PPPs for SHS infrastructure. The SHSSP includes a DLI that \nrequires the government to prepare a feasibility study to evaluate the use of PPPs for the \ndelivery of SHS infrastructure and the successful preparation and tendering of a PPP-based \nprocurement package. A dedicated technical unit is needed to mainstream and strengthen \nDepEd\u2019s implementation and oversight of school infrastructure PPPs. There is currently no such \nunit within DepEd with specific responsibility for infrastructure PPPs. To date, work relating to \ninfrastructure PPPs has been managed out of the Office of the Undersecretary of Finance and \nAdministration.  \n \n6.  There  is  a  need  to  strengthen  DepEd\u2019s  systems  and  capacity  for  managing  and \nimplementing RBLs and other results-based programs. The SHSSP uses the RBL modality \nwhereby key elements of the government\u2019s basic education results framework are articulated as \nDLIs that are linked to loan disbursements. The RBL modality was adopted for several reasons \n(i)  the existence of  a rational and comprehensive basic education reform program (the K to 12 \nprogram) with strong government ownership, which the RBL is supporting; (ii) improvements in \ngovernment management and fiduciary systems; (iii) the government\u2019s strong commitment to \nquality  improvement  through  the  approval  and  application  of  the  K  to  12  medium-term \nexpenditure  plan  that  enables  predictable  and  sustainable  program  financing;  and  (iv)  the \nextensive engagement and support of  other development partners in the implementation of the \nprogram.  The  SHSSP,  therefore,  promotes  the  government\u2019s  strategy  to  harmonize  and \ncoordinate efforts to achieve the target results.  \n \n7.  ADB is working closely with the Government of Australia, the World Bank, and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency to coordinate assistance to the SHSSP. The ADB TA will \ncomplement support being provided to DepEd through these development partners. The Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency\u2019s  Project  for  Supporting  Senior  High  School  Modeling  in \nSelected  Technical  Vocational  High  Schools  TA  is  providing  technical  support,  including \nmaterials and equipment, to DepEd in its efforts to fine-tune activities in a small number of \npublic  technical\u2013vocational  high  schools  where  K  to  12  is  being  piloted.6 The  Australian \ngovernment\u2019s  $150  million  Basic  Education  Sector  Transformation  Program,  which  was \napproved  in  2014,  provides  assistance  focused  on  improving  teaching  and  learning  (e.g., \ncurriculum and assessment methods, in-service teacher training, pre-service teacher training \ncurriculum) and on strengthening systems (e.g., capacity for policy and planning and DepEd \norganizational structures).7 The World Bank\u2019s Learning, Equity, and Accountability Program \n                                                \n6  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2014.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The proposed TA will strengthen DepEd\u2019s capacity to manage RBL programs and to \ncommunicate, implement, and oversee the new SHS voucher and SHS infrastructure PPP \nprograms. The TA is aligned with the effective implementation of the K to 12 program, in line \nwith the Act and the Philippine Development Plan 2011\u20132016 Midterm Update.9 The outcome \nwill be DepEd\u2019s strengthened capacity for effective implementation and oversight of key elements \nof the SHSSP.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will strengthen DepEd\u2019s capacity to implement the SHS voucher program, SHS \ninfrastructure PPPs, and the RBL modality. Expected TA outputs are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Output 1: Capacity of the Department of Education to implement senior \nhigh  school  voucher  program  strengthened.  The  TA  will  assist  in  (a) \nestablishing a technical unit in DepEd that will be responsible for developing, \nimplementing and monitoring the SHS voucher and ESC programs, including \ndrafting and monitoring the contract with FAPE for the implementation of the SHS \nvoucher program and ESC program; (b) developing and establishing operating \nprocedures, processes, and rigorous monitoring and evaluation systems in the \nnew unit; (c) providing capacity building and on-the-job training for DepEd staff \nand contractors, including building the skills and competencies for the ongoing \ndevelopment, implementation and monitoring of the SHS voucher program and \nthe ESC program; and (d) building DepEd\u2019s capacity to develop and deliver a \ncommunications plan for the SHS voucher program, including development of a \ncommunications strategy and communications materials.  \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Capacity of the Department of Education to implement senior \nhigh school infrastructure public\u2013private partnerships strengthened.
