INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Azerbaijan requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical \nassistance (TA) for the support of the formulation of its new national poverty reduction strategy. \nIn  considering  this  request,  ADB  developed  a  concept  paper,  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment, and this paper was endorsed by a peer review for funding from the Cooperation \nFund in Support of the Formulation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies (NPRS Fund) on \n17 November 2004. ADB fielded a fact-finding mission to Azerbaijan on 17\u201326 January 2005. \nThis mission reached an understanding with the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.1 \nThe design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Azerbaijan enjoyed strong growth and a stable macroeconomic environment in recent \nyears.  Since  2000,  growth  in  real  gross  domestic  product  averaged  10.6%  per  year,  with \ninflation at a moderate 3.0% annually. The Government maintained prudent fiscal policy, and its \nmonetary policy supported low inflation rates. However, this strong growth performance masks \na considerable poverty problem in the country. According to the 2002 household budget survey, \n46.7% of the population lives in poverty.2 Much of the recent growth and immediate growth \nprospects come from the development of the oil and gas sector. The country is now shifting \nfrom a situation where growth was driven by oil-sector investments to one in which growth will \nbe driven by oil-sector production. A key issue for the country is how to ensure that the benefits \nof the country\u2019s growth reach all segments of society. \n \n3.  From July 2001 to October 2002, the Government prepared its strategy for poverty \nreduction,  which  was  entitled  the  State  Programme  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic \nDevelopment (SPPRED) 2003\u20132005. The Ministry of Economic Development (MOED), through \nthe SPPRED Secretariat, led the development of the strategy and the broad public consultations \nthat supported this process. ADB provided TA to support the preparation of the strategy and \nstrengthen the capacity of the SPPRED Secretariat to guide the strategy\u2019s implementation.3 The \nboards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank endorsed SPPRED 2003\u20132005 \nas the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper. ADB also endorsed the strategy, basing its \ncountry strategy and program updates on this document. \n \n4.  As  the  implementation  period  for  SPPRED  2003\u20132005  comes  to  a  close,  the \nGovernment announced its intention to develop its follow-on poverty reduction plan. The new \nstrategy will be a 10-year strategy centered on the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals  (MDG).  The  Government  will  take  advantage  of  the  capacity  for  developing  and \nimplementing  poverty  reduction  plans  within  the  SPPRED  Secretariat,  as  the  Government \nembarks on the formulation of the MDG strategy. Under SPPRED 2003\u20132005, the SPPRED \nSecretariat was responsible for (i) coordinating the efforts of government agencies and funding \norganizations in ensuring successful implementation of the policy actions set out in the national \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 December 2004. \n2  The poverty line of AZM175,000 ($36) is based on a minimum-needs consumption basket that includes food and \nnonfood items. \n3  ADB\u2019s main support was through the following TAs: ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Azerbaijan \nfor Capacity Building for Poverty Data Analysis. Manila; ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of \nAzerbaijan for Preparation of the Medium-Term National Poverty Reduction Strategy. Manila; and ADB. 2003. \nTechnical Assistance to the Republic of Azerbaijan for Capacity Building for Medium-Term Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Implementation. Manila.  \n ", "2   \nstrategy, (ii) improving government capacity to define and monitor key poverty indicators, (iii) \ntaking the participatory process forward and developing further the dialogue between policy \nmakers and civil society, (iv) monitoring the implementation of the policy measures set out in the \nnational strategy and reviewing them on an annual basis, and (v) ensuring that macroeconomic \nand fiscal policies are consistent and support the strategy set out in the document. \n \n5.  While much was accomplished during the implementation of SPPRED, further capacity \nbuilding will enhance the effectiveness of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction efforts under the \nnew strategy. In particular, the participatory processes should be refined and expanded to better \nreflect the priorities of the local communities in the national strategy and provide better feedback \non the poverty impacts of the Government\u2019s efforts. Moreover, the links between MOED and the \nSPPRED  Secretariat  (the  planning  and  monitoring  arm  of  the  Government)  and  the  line \nministries responsible for executing the public investment plan need to be strengthened. Finally, \nthe strategy\u2019s targets need to be fully costed and integrated into the medium-term expenditure \nframework and public investment program and reflected in the annual fiscal budgets, if the \nstrategy is to be credible. \n \n6.  During the development and implementation of SPPRED 2003\u20132005, ADB coordinated \nclosely with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank, as the \nthree agencies all provided TA to the SPPRED Secretariat. In general, ADB TA supported \nstrategy  implementation,  while  UNDP  TA  supported  poverty  monitoring  and  World  Bank \nassistance helped strengthen the links to the fiscal budget. That close cooperation will continue \nunder this TA. UNDP already began additional assistance to the Government to develop the \nMDG strategy, and the scope of work and terms of reference for this TA were discussed with \nUNDP, to avoid overlap. \n \n7.  ADB is preparing the first full country strategy and program (CSP) for Azerbaijan. By \nproviding technical support for the formulation of the national poverty reduction strategy, ADB \ncan better harmonize its assistance program with the country\u2019s development priorities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will assist the Government in integrating the achievement of the MDG into its \ndevelopment planning and implementation processes. The main outcome will be the enhanced \nplanning and monitoring capacity of MOED to achieve those goals. The main deliverables of the \nTA are (i) an evaluation of SPPRED 2003\u20132005, emphasizing lessons learned, to aid in the \npreparation of the country\u2019s next phase of its poverty reduction strategy; (ii) an integrated \ntraining program to improve the planning capacity of the interministerial sector working groups \nand link their work to the national strategy; (iii) a strategy for achieving the country\u2019s MDG \ntargets,  with  a  fully  costed  investment  plan;  and  (iv)  the  procedures  and  processes  for \nmonitoring strategy implementation, updating the strategy based on implementation experience, \nmonitoring budgetary flows and revising the costing, and disseminating information on the \nprogress in achieving the goals. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will build on the practices and institutional structures established during the \nSPPRED 2003\u20132005 process. The scope of work will include (i) an evaluation of SPPRED \n2003\u20132005 and (ii) support for MDG strategy formulation and implementation. \n ", "  3\n1.  Evaluation of the State Programme on Poverty Reduction and Economic \nDevelopment 2003\u20132005 \n \n10.  The  evaluation  of  the  SPPRED  2003\u20132005  component  will  be  a  key  input  for  the \nformulation of the MDG strategy and ADB\u2019s CSP. This component will prepare an evaluation \nstudy of processes used to develop and implement SPPRED, institutions involved, and systems \nestablished for monitoring and evaluating impacts of the strategy. The evaluation will include \ndiscussions in the regions with community groups involved in earlier consultations, to gauge \ntheir impressions of the effectiveness of the participatory aspects of SPPRED. The study will \nemphasize lessons learned, so as to inform all involved of the development and implementation \nof the MDG strategy. Related to the evaluation work, this component will include the preparation \nof the country poverty assessment, which is a key background study for the CSP that provides a \ncomprehensive examination of the constraints to and opportunities for poverty reduction in the \ncountry, so as to better align ADB\u2019s assistance. \n  \n  2.  Millennium Development Goals Strategy Formulation and Implementation \n \n11.  The  MDG  strategy  formulation  and  implementation  component  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to develop a fully costed strategy for achieving the MDG, including targets \nand baseline indicators appropriate for Azerbaijan\u2019s current state of development. The MDG \nstrategy and its annual progress reports and updates will be produced in a participatory manner, \nthrough a series of regional meetings. The strategy documents and annual updates will be \ndiscussed  in  an  annual  workshop  by  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  including  government \nagencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  private  sector  organizations  and \ndevelopment partner community members. This component will also facilitate the meetings of \nthe interministerial sector working groups that were established as part of the SPPRED process, \nto provide an important feedback mechanism to the SPPRED Secretariat from the technical \nexperts within government on the feasibility of the strategy and implementation progress. \n \n12.  The TA will strengthen the strategy implementation and impact monitoring mechanisms \nput in place under SPPRED 2003\u20132005, enhancing the capacity of the SPPRED Secretariat to \ncarry out participatory poverty impact monitoring of projects and policy measures identified in \nthe strategy. This component will also engage the services of two local NGOs, to enhance the \nscope of participatory monitoring of the strategy during implementation. The TA will also advise \nall involved on the inclusion of qualitative poverty indicators in the MDG monitoring system, in \nconsultation with the SPPRED poverty monitoring unit, including setting appropriate baselines. \n \n13.  The MDG costing and budgeting exercise will support the development of feasible MDG \ntargets, by making explicit the financial implications of these targets. The TA will prepare cost \nestimates of the investments and policy reforms needed to achieve the strategic targets, given \nthe baseline levels of the agreed indicators. The TA will also provide analytical support to the \nfiscal  budgeting  process,  to  ensure  that  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework,  public \ninvestment plan, and annual fiscal budgets are consistent with MDG strategy costing. The TA \nwill also monitor the execution of the fiscal budget, to highlight any shifts in spending patterns \ninconsistent with the achievement of the MDG targets and prescribe early corrective actions. \n \n14.  The TA will provide assistance for capacity building and information dissemination and \nprepare a training-needs assessment that will be based on previous needs assessments within \nthe  SPPRED  Secretariat  and  take  into  account  training  already  completed.  From  this \nassessment, the TA will develop a training program and deliver training courses to strengthen \nthe capacity of the sector working groups to implement the MDG strategy. The TA will also \n ", "4   \nprepare and execute a public information plan, contracting a local public relations and media \nadvisory services firm for this purpose. The plan will use various media to notify the public about \nthe MDG strategy formulation process and disseminate strategy implementation results. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,070,000 equivalent, comprising $592,000 in \nforeign exchange and $478,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the NPRS Fund and by ADB's TA funding program. The NPRS Fund will provide \n$650,000 equivalent, comprising $432,000 in foreign exchange and $218,000 equivalent in local \ncurrency. ADB will provide $200,000 equivalent, comprising $160,000 in foreign exchange and \n$40,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government will finance the remaining $220,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs, covering in-kind support, such as office facilities and \nadministrative support and staff time. Appendix 2 shows the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The SPPRED Secretariat within MOED will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The \nconsultants will work closely with the head of the SPPRED Secretariat. The Government will \nestablish an advisory board, with representatives from the relevant line ministries and the main \ndevelopment partner agencies involved in the formulation and implementation of the MDG \nstrategy.  The  Government  will  also  form  a  small  development  partner  coordination  group \nconsisting of ADB, UNDP, and World Bank. The TA will be implemented over the 24-month \nperiod covering the formulation of the MDG strategy and the first year of implementation. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference are given in \nAppendix 3. \n \n17.  For the evaluation of SPPRED 2003\u20132005, ADB will recruit on an individual basis an \ninternational  strategy  evaluation  specialist  for  2  person-months  and  a  domestic  poverty \nreduction specialist for 3 person-months. The consultants under this component will support the \npreparation of the CSP by drafting the country poverty assessment. \n \n18.  For the services in support of MDG strategy formulation and implementation, the scope \nof work will cover (i) MDG strategy development; (ii) MDG strategy implementation monitoring, \nstrategy updating, and information dissemination; and (iii) MDG-related training program design \nand execution. In terms of international experts, ADB will engage an economist and team \nleader, a participatory monitoring and training specialist, and an economist and public finance \nspecialist for a total of 15 person-months. For the services of the international experts, a \nconsulting firm will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection, with short-listed firms \nsubmitting simplified technical proposals. The consultants will engage the two local NGOs using \ndirect selection, based on criteria acceptable to ADB. The consultants will contract the services \nof a domestic public relations and media advisory services firm, following the provisions of \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. As the estimated value of the contract is below $100,000 \nequivalent, direct purchase may be used. \n \n19.  For the domestic experts, ADB will recruit a participatory implementation and monitoring \nspecialist, a human capital development specialist, a regional development specialist, a gender \nand development specialist, and two public finance specialists for a total of about 96 person-\nmonths.  The  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  by  ADB,  in \n ", "  5\ncooperation with the head of the SPPRED Secretariat. Direct selection will be used, where \napplicable,  for  consultants  engaged  under  existing  TA  arrangements  with  the  SPPRED \nSecretariat, to provide continuity. The head of the SPPRED Secretariat will supervise the day-\nto-day work of the domestic experts, and the team leader will coordinate their work with the \ninputs of the international experts. \n \n20.  The main report under the services for the evaluation of SPPRED 2003\u20132005 is the \nevaluation  study.  A  draft  evaluation  report  will  be  submitted  by  the  seventh  week  of  the \ninternational evaluation specialist\u2019s term of service. The report will be circulated to government \nagencies, ADB, and other development partners that were involved in the SPPRED 2003\u20132005 \nprocess,  for  their  review.  The  international  evaluation  specialist  will  revise  the  report,  as \nnecessary, and submit the final report at the end of the assignment in October 2005. The \nconsultant will submit three print copies and one electronic copy of the report in English to ADB \nand three print copies and one electronic copy in Azeri to the head of the SPPRED Secretariat. \nThe preliminary country poverty assessment will be submitted to ADB by October 2005 as well. \n \n21.  The main reports under the services for the formulation and implementation of the MDG \nstrategy are the following: (i) inception report to be submitted 2 weeks after the commencement \nof the services of the team leader; (ii) quarterly TA implementation status reports, quarterly \ntraining  reports,  and  quarterly  public  information  reports;  (iii)  special  reports  prepared  in \nadvance of TA review missions or following the completion of key activities (e.g., reports on \nnational workshops and town hall meetings); and (iv) draft final and final reports. For the MDG \nstrategy  costing  and  budgeting  exercise,  the  consultants  will  submit  (i)  full  costing  of  the \ninvestments needed to achieve the MDG targets, given the baselines for the agreed indicators \n(submitted by December 2005); (ii) annual analytical reports of the fiscal budget (final drafts in \nDecember 2005 and 2006); and (iii) quarterly reports monitoring the execution of the fiscal \nbudget (submitted 2 months after the end of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the 2006 fiscal \nyear). The consultants will submit three print copies and one electronic copy of all reports in \nEnglish to ADB and three print copies and one electronic copy of all reports in Azeri to the head \nof the SPPRED Secretariat. \n \n22.  Results under the TA will be disseminated through three direct channels. First, the town \nhall meetings held during the design and implementation of the MDG strategy will provide an \ninteractive forum for informing civil society in the regions. Second, the annual strategy review \nworkshops will be used to inform representatives from  government agencies, civil society, \nbusiness organizations, and the development partner community. Finally, the TA includes a \npublic information component that will develop a variety of information dissemination vehicles, \npossibly including print, internet, and video, geared to reach a variety of audiences. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation of National \nPoverty Reduction Strategies, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent \nof  $200,000  on  a  grant  basis  to  the  Government  of  Azerbaijan  for  Participatory  Strategy \nDevelopment and Implementation for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nImpact      Assumptions \nGovernment has integrated  \u2022 Government approval of  \u2022 Parliamentary  \u2022 Government approval of the \nMDG achievement into  MDG strategy (by June 2006)  proceedings and  strategy developed under MOED \nnational development  and its annual updates  presidential decrees  leadership \nplanning and  \u2022 Government approval of  \u2022 Ministry of Finance,  \u2022 MOED is able to influence fiscal \nimplementation processes  fiscal allocations and  Annual Budget of the  budget priorities \n  expenditures linked to  Republic of  \u2022 Functions of the SPPRED \nachieving the goals in the  Azerbaijan  Secretariat absorbed into MOED \nstrategy  and funded by the Government at \nthe end of ADB\u2019s TA. \n \nRisk \n\u2022 Budgetary priorities shift away \nfrom MDG achievement \n(mitigation: continuous monitoring \nwill highlight any shifts early \nenough to take corrective action) \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nPlanning and monitoring  \u2022 Baselines and country- \u2022 Ministry of Finance,  \u2022 Advisory board, including \ncapacity of MOED has  specific MDG targets set and  Annual Budget of the  representatives of line ministries \nbeen strengthened  fully costed by December  Republic of  and development partner \n  2005  Azerbaijan  agencies, established prior to TA \n\u2022 Annually updated plans with  \u2022 Annual report on the  inception \nfiscal allocations and  progress in  \u2022 Active involvement of government \nexpenditures linked to the  implementing the  line agencies, development \nstrategy  MDG plan  partners, civil society organizations \n\u2022 Participatory methods  \u2022 MDG monitoring  in MOED-led strategy development \nintegrated into the planning  system  \u2022 MDG monitoring system updated \nprocess (beginning October  \u2022 Training reports and  as soon as a new data becomes \n2005)  public information  available \n\u2022 MOED dissemination of  program reports   \naccurate and timely    Risk \ninformation on progress in  \u2022 Government agencies, \nachieving MDG (beginning in  development partners, and other \nDecember 2005 with  stakeholders not providing \nbaselines)  monitoring data and feedback in a \n  timely fashion (mitigation: TA will \npromote stronger ties between the \nSPPRED Secretariat and the \nsector working groups) \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
