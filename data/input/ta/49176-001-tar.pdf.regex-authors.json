INTRODUCTION \n1.  Timor-Leste is one of the most petroleum-dependent economies in the world. With \npetroleum revenues declining rapidly, fiscal reforms are needed to improve service delivery and \nprevent the rapid depletion of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Public expenditure can be \nrationalized and domestic revenue collection improved, but the government\u2019s capacity to design \nand implement complex reforms is limited. Technical assistance (TA) is needed to support \nsuccessful reforms and mitigate the risk of negative impacts on poor and vulnerable groups. \n \n2.  Since 2015 when the Government of Timor-Leste\u2019s Fiscal Reform Commission (FRC) \nwas established, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing it with TA support. \nDuring 2015\u20132016 ADB used regional TA programs to (i) support the design of a new value-\nadded tax (VAT), (ii) provide specialist inputs to support the drafting of VAT legislation and \ndesigning of a new tax administration, and (iii) share regional experiences on the role that state-\nowned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  autonomous  public  agencies (APAs) play  in  public  service \ndelivery.1 \n \n3.  The government has asked ADB to continue supporting the fiscal reform program. Initial \nconsultations identified the strengthening of policy and legal frameworks for SOEs and APAs \nand the building of government capacity for evidence-based fiscal policy as priorities for ADB \nassistance. ADB fielded a fact-finding mission from 19 February to 4 March to consult formally \nwith the government and other stakeholders. During this mission, ADB and the government \nreached an agreement on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA, which is closely aligned with the \nexpected strategic directions of a new ADB country partnership strategy for Timor-Leste. The \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations and business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Timor-Leste and \nis closely aligned with ADB\u2019s upcoming country knowledge plan for Timor-Leste.2 The design \nand monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Fiscal reform is one of the main priorities of the Sixth Constitutional Government of \nTimor-Leste.3 Public expenditure, excluding grants, increased from $171 million in 2006 to $1.33 \nbillion in 2015 and has been budgeted at an average of $1.98 billion per year for 2016\u20132020. \nIncreased public spending has been financed by  withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund, a \nsovereign wealth fund established by the government to manage the income from offshore oil \nand gas production. These withdrawals financed 86.9% of total public spending during 2007\u2013\n2015 and are projected to finance 80.0% of total public spending during 2016\u20132020.4 \n \n5.  Petroleum production accounted for 81% of total gross domestic product in 2012, but \nproven reserves are modest and current production is forecast to end in 2021. The Petroleum \nFund Law stipulates that the fund should be managed prudently for the benefit of current and \nfuture generations. 5 To this end, the law defines the estimated sustainable income (ESI) as an \n                                                \n1  E.

Parliamentary Law No. 9/2005. Dili \n ", " 2\naudited estimate of the income that could be withdrawn from the fund each year in perpetuity.6 \nSince 2008, successive governments have used withdrawals in excess of the ESI to front-load \ninvestments in infrastructure and service delivery. Withdrawals were 1.8 times the ESI in 2015 \nand are budgeted at an average of 3.1 times the ESI for 2016\u20132020. The Petroleum Fund\u2019s \nbalance is projected to increase to $16.9 billion in 2016 ($13,200 per capita) before declining in \nsubsequent years due to excess withdrawals (footnote 3). To stabilize the fund\u2019s balance to \npreserve savings for future generations, withdrawals must be brought back in line with the ESI. \nThis  can  be  achieved  through  a  combination  of  reductions  in  total  spending,  increased \nmobilization of non-oil revenues, increases in the ESI (e.g., through the development of new oil \nand gas deposits), and greater use of concessional financing facilities. \n \n6.   Although recurrent expenditure grew at an average annual rate of 15.2% during 2008\u2013\n2015, targets for the coverage and quality of key public services are yet to be achieved.7 The \nhigh  level  of  Petroleum  Fund  withdrawals  means  that,  even  with  strong  growth  in  non-oil \nrevenues, there is little room for sustained increases in public spending. The challenge for the \ngovernment is to realign and reprioritize expenditure to improve service delivery and ensure \nlong-term fiscal sustainability.  The government  has  established  the  FRC  to  coordinate the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  a  major  fiscal  reform  program.  The  FRC  includes  senior \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and other relevant government agencies \nand is overseen by an interministerial council chaired by the Prime Minister. \n \n7.  Domestic non-oil revenues increased from $48.9 million in 2006 to $170.0 million in \n2015 and are projected to grow to $210.3 million (12.0% of budgeted spending) by 2020. Tax \nrevenue accounted for 72.1% of non-oil revenues in 2015 and was collected through personal \nand corporate income taxes, import duties, final withholding taxes on government-financed \ncontracts, and excise taxes. The tax revenue collected can be increased by changing policies \nand modernizing the tax administration. The FRC has prepared a package of tax legislation for \nParliament approval in 2016, including adjustments to tax rates and the introduction of a new \nVAT law. The Government of Portugal and the World Bank Group are expected to support the \nmodernization of the tax administration and the implementation of new taxes. \n \n8.  The FRC is also planning to strengthen the policy and legal frameworks governing \nnontax revenues, SOEs, and APAs. Significant synergies exist between these reforms and \nADB\u2019s support for infrastructure, education, and financial services. SOEs are corporate entities \nthat are fully or majority-owned by the government. APAs are public bodies that have been \ngranted some degree of financial and managerial autonomy relative to the general systems of \npublic  administration.  Timor-Leste\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132030  notes  that \ntransferring  some  public  functions  to  APAs  and  SOEs  may  help  improve  the  quality  and \nefficiency of public service delivery.8 It cites the management of ports, airports, water supply, \nelectricity generation and distribution, higher education, and hospitals as examples of state \nfunctions that could be delivered through SOEs and APAs. The Strategic Development Plan \nalso  identifies  the  need  for  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  policy  and  legal  frameworks \ngoverning SOEs and APAs. Until this review is completed, decisions to exercise public functions \nthrough SOEs, APAs, or other entities may not be supported by a robust legal framework and a \nclear and coherent rationale. \n                                                \n6  The ESI is calculated as 3% of the estimated total petroleum wealth incorporating the current value of Petroleum \nFund assets and a discounted forecast of revenues from oil and gas fields, which have production agreements. \n7  Ministry of Finance, Government of Timor-Leste. 2014.

Timor-Leste  has  five  SOEs  and  about  50  APAs,  almost  all  of  which  operated  as \ngovernment  departments  with  no  financial  or  managerial  autonomy  until  2016  when  the \ngovernment began to implement provisions for such autonomy for 20 of them (footnote 3). \nThese agencies now follow streamlined processes for budget execution and have been given \nthe power to retain some of the revenues that they collect from service fees and charges.9 The \ngovernment has also decided to convert its Infrastructure Fund into an APA.10 \n \n10.  SOEs and APAs account for about 93% of budgeted public investment and 38% of \nbudgeted expenditure for 2016\u20132020. This share could increase significantly if functions such \nas electricity supply are transferred to autonomous entities. SOEs and APAs also play an \nimportant  role  in  domestic  revenue  collection.  Current  and  potential  SOEs  and  APAs  are \nexpected to collect 63.6% of nontax revenues in 2016 (20.4% of total domestic revenues) and \ncould collect significantly more in the future. Current regulation of the fees and charges levied \nby  SOEs  and  APAs  is  relatively  weak  and  provides  limited  collection  incentives.  The \ngovernment has identified the need to review and update the legal framework for fees and \ncharges, which will have a significant impact on service delivery and cost recovery. \n \n11.  The benefits of increasing the autonomy of service providers could be undermined by \ncapacity constraints and gaps in the current policy and legal frameworks for SOEs and APAs. A \n2003 decree-law established a legal framework for SOEs that only applies to certain public \nenterprises.11 The Budget and Financial Management Law establishes high-level requirements \nfor financial reporting by APAs supplemented by legal provisions specific to each APA.12 A \ncomprehensive review of the policy and legal frameworks can help ensure alignment with \ngovernment priorities and the current public sector capacity. \n \n12.  Timor-Leste is also planning to decentralize its public administration to improve service \ndelivery and accountability. The Oecusse exclave was designated as a special administrative \nregion  in  2014.  In  2016,  the  national  government  enacted  a  law  to  guide  the  transfer  of \nadministrative functions to Timor-Leste\u2019s other municpalites. Autonomous municipal authorities \nwill  be  established  in  the  four  largest  municipalities,  and  non-autonomous  municipal \nadministrations will be established in the remaining eight municipalities.13 All of the subnational \nadministrations will be funded through the national budget and will be required to submit budget \nproposals  to  the  Ministry  of  State  Administration.  They  may  also  derive  revenue  from \nagreements  with  national  government  bodies  to  assume  responsibility  for  local  delivery  of \nspecific public functions. Additional analysis is needed to guide the determination of fiscal \ntransfers to municipal authorities and administrations and the role of these bodies in revenue \ncollection. Timor-Leste can benefit from analysis that draws on the experiences of relevant \ncountries in Asia and the Pacific to present possible policy options. \n \n13.  Fiscal reforms could substantially impact household welfare by introducing new taxes \nand service charges, and changing the composition of public spending and the quality and \ncoverage of public services. It is therefore important to ensure that major reforms and ongoing \npolicy initiatives do not have a disproportionate negative  impact on poor and vulnerable groups. \nData  from  recent  national  surveys  provide  a  good  information  base  for  welfare  analysis; \n                                                \n9  These SOEs and APAs are required to use the government\u2019s financial management information system to execute \ntheir expenditure but are subject to MOF ex-ante oversight or control. \n10 The Council of Ministers approved the legislation to implement this change on 3 February 2016 and submitted it to \nthe President for promulgation. The law is yet to be promulgated as of 1 May 2016. \n11 Government of Timor-Leste. 2003. Decree Law No. 14/2003. Dili. \n12 Government of Timor-Leste. 2009. Decree Law No. 13/2009.

Dili. \n ", " 4\nhowever, the government\u2019s capacity to analyze the welfare implications of proposed policy \nchanges is limited. The MOF\u2019s Economic Policy Directorate is responsible for carrying out \nmacroeconomic modeling and analysis to inform the government\u2019s economic and fiscal policies. \nThe directorate\u2019s capacity has increased in recent years, but the MOF has identified a need to \nstrengthen the directorate\u2019s analytical tools and staff capacity further. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be fiscal sustainability and improved service delivery. The outcome will \nbe improved legal and regulatory frameworks for service delivery and improved capacity for \neconomic policy analysis. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA outcome will be achieved through two related TA outputs: (i) improved legal and \nregulatory  frameworks  for  service  delivery,  and  (ii)  improved  capacity  for  economic  policy \nanalysis. A number of risks could derail the achievement of this outcome. National elections and \nother  political  changes  could  disrupt  the  reform  process  and  reduce  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment to implement reforms; and capacity development activities could be undermined by \nthe limited availability of data, knowledge gaps, and competing priorities for public officials\u2019 time. \n \n16.  Output  1:  Improved  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  service  delivery. \nIncreasing the financial and managerial autonomy of some public service providers could be a \npowerful mechanism for improving the quality, coverage, and efficiency of service delivery. \nHowever, increased autonomy will also create new risks. A policy framework and supporting \nlegislation are clearly needed to clarify the preconditions and extent of autonomy and establish \nsystems  of  governance  and  oversight  to  manage  the  associated  risks.  ADB  will  provide \ntechnical inputs to help the MOF and FRC do the following: \n(i)  provide a diagnostic assessment of the legal and operational characteristics of \ncurrent APAs and SOEs, \n(ii)  assess current capacity for the monitoring and oversight of APAs and SOEs, \n(iii)  develop a policy and legal framework for APAs and SOEs, \n(iv)  pilot new policy and legislative frameworks in selected APAs and SOEs, and \n(v)  develop a policy and legal framework for public fees and charges. \n \n17.  Output  2:  Improved  capacity  for  economic  policy  analysis.  Long-term  fiscal \nsustainability will require public expenditure reforms and increased domestic revenue collection. \nAppropriate  fiscal  policy  will  also  be  an  important  element  of  successful  decentralization. \nRigorous analysis can help ensure that policy changes support improvements in service delivery \nand fiscal sustainability while protecting poor and vulnerable groups. Data from recent national \nhousehold surveys and a range of other sources can be used to guide policy making, but \ngovernment capacity to use this data to analyze reform options and model distributional impacts \nis limited. ADB will provide technical specialists to train MOF economists and work with them on \nspecific pieces of modeling and analysis. Specifically, they will do the following: \n(i)  review and map existing data sets and options for quantitative welfare analysis; \n(ii)  conduct an initial capacity assessment and training needs analysis for MOF \neconomists; \n(iii)  train MOF economists on economic concepts and tools for quantitative analysis; \n ", "5 \n(iv)  develop  an  analytical  framework  for  modeling  the  welfare  and  distributional \nimpacts of public expenditure and planned fiscal reforms; \n(v)  analyze options for subnational fiscal policy; \n(vi)  support the application of the analytical framework to key policy questions and \nthe integration of analytical results into policy making and resource allocation \nprocesses, including the national budget; and \n(vii)  support other discrete pieces of economic policy analysis. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  venues  and \nrefreshments  for  training  and  workshops,  and  any  software  licenses  that  are  required  for \ngovernment staff. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The MOF will be the executing and implementing agency of the TA. The fiscal reform \ncoordinator and director general for state finances will guide and supervise TA activities. TA \nimplementation will be coordinated with the Office of the Prime Minister, the Office of the \nCoordinating Minister for the Economic Affairs, and other relevant public bodies. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented from June 2016 to December 2018 and will require 41 \nperson-months of international consultant inputs. The implementation of output 1 will be led by \nan APA expert who will serve as team leader for the output (8 person-months). The APA \nspecialist will be supported by an SOE governance expert who will be responsible for the SOE-\nrelated components of output 1 (6 person-months). A senior welfare economist (5 person-\nmonths) will provide technical leadership for output 2. They will be supported by an economics \ntraining  specialist  (16  person-months)  who  will  provide  training  and  capacity  development \nsupport to MOF staff, an expert on subnational fiscal policy (4 months), and other technical \nspecialists who will provide knowledge support to address specific fiscal policy issues (up to 2 \nperson-months). Due to the specialized nature of the tasks, the consultants will be engaged \nindividually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  disbursement  of  funds  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  TA outputs will be disseminated using existing government mechanisms. The FRC will \ncoordinate public consultation on policy and legislative changes supported under output 1. \nApproved  policies  and  enacted  laws  will  be  published  online.  The  MOF  will  lead  the \ndissemination of the policy analysis supported under output 2 of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Timor-Leste for Fiscal Policy for Improved Service Delivery, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with: \nFiscal sustainability and improved service deliverya \n  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators  Reporting \nOutcome  with Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImproved legal and  a.
