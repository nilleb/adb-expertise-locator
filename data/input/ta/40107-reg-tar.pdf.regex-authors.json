Seminars on business opportunities are conducted by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  to  inform  the  business  community  in  ADB  member  countries  of  opportunities  for \ninvolvement in ADB-financed projects. ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office (COSO) also \nprovides regional technical assistance (RETA) for seminars on capacity building for project \nimplementation  and  administration  and  for  developing  national  consultants  in  developing \nmember countries. ADB has conducted 199 seminars in 33 member countries on business \nopportunities since 1985 under RETA grants. The seminars familiarize prospective suppliers, \nmanufacturers, and contractors with ADB procedures for procurement of goods and works and \nprospective  consultants  with  ADB  procedures  for  recruitment  of  consultants.  This  RETA1 \nsupports further seminars on business opportunities over a 3-year period from late 2006 to the \nend of 2009, including the development of web-based training materials to enhance ADB's \noutreach effort beyond those physically involved in the seminars. Concept clearance for this \nRETA was sought and approved on 24 March 2006.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The key procurement principles in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants are (i) economy and efficiency, (ii) transparency, and (iii) equal opportunity. \nThese principles are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy which aims to (i) support \ncompetitive markets and effective public administration, (ii) support explicit anticorruption efforts, \nand (iii) ensure that all individuals and firms involved in ADB-financed projects adhere to the \nhighest ethical standards. The seminars on business opportunities under this RETA are part of \na systematic approach in support of the above principles to enhance competition in ADB-\nfinanced procurement and recruitment of consultants, promote cost-effectiveness, and combat \nfraud and corruption. \n \n3.  Significant portions of the loan, grant, and TA proceeds of ADB-financed projects are \nused to fund procurement of goods, works, and consultant services. Consultants are required \nfor most of ADB\u2019s TA and loan operations. To be eligible for financing, all contracts must be \nawarded following ADB procedures. ADB procedures for procurement of goods and works and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  have  been  developed  following  international  best  practices  and \nexperience and have been harmonized with those of other multilateral development banks to a \nsignificant  extent.  However,  in  some  aspects  they  differ  from  procedures  used  by  donor \ncountries and it is, therefore, necessary for potential bidders and consultants to become familiar \nwith ADB procedures to maximize their opportunities in competing for contracts financed by \nADB.  \n \n4.  Requests for these seminars usually originate from interested host organizations such \nas chambers of commerce, consulting associations, contractors associations, federations of \nindustries,  and  ministries  of  trade.  Such  requests  are  channeled  through  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors. The demand for these seminars is increasing, especially in borrowing countries, \nwhere national industries strive to increase their participation in ADB-financed procurement \nopportunities. The structure and content of the seminars have been improved over time to \nreflect changes in ADB policies and procedures as well as lessons learned from the past. \n \n5.  Favorable feedback on the seminars has been received via offices of the Board of \nDirectors. The agencies and government bodies that have hosted the seminars have indicated \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 19 May 2006. \n ", "2   \nthat they were very useful in communicating the importance of ADB\u2019s operational activities to \nparticipants. From ADB\u2019s perspective, the success of the seminars is evidenced by increased \ncompetition for procurement opportunities.  \n \n6.  In addition, the seminars have proved useful as public relations and information-sharing \nactivities.  They  create  greater  business  community  awareness,  in  donor  and  borrowing \ncountries,  of  ADB's  (i)  commitment  to  economy  and  efficiency,  and  (ii) dedication  to \ntransparency in the procurement process. They highlight the role the anticorruption policy plays \nin the procurement of goods and works and the recruitment of consultants. The TA framework is \npresented in Appendix 1. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  seminars  aim  to  make  interested  parties  in  the  business  communities  in  ADB \nmember countries aware of (i) how to identify ADB business opportunities, (ii) how to pursue \nthese opportunities, (iii) ADB\u2019s procurement policies and procedures, (iv) methods of payment \nunder ADB-financed contracts, (v) procedures for evaluating bids, and (vi) redress procedures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The seminars will be conducted in donor and borrowing countries.2 If requested, they \nmay be held in more than one location in a host country. The seminars will be held from late \n2006 to December 2009. It is intended that the seminars be equitably distributed among ADB\u2019s \nmember countries; because of this, normally a seminar will not be held more than once every 12 \nmonths  in  any  member  country.  The  possibility  of  holding  seminars  and/or  consecutive \nseminars in two or more countries back-to-back will be pursued to use resources efficiently. \n \n9.  The seminars will cover the following topics: \n \n(i)  ADB's mission, organization, and operations; \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s project cycle, and the opportunities that exist at each stage of the cycle; \n(iii)  the provision of advance information about forthcoming business opportunities as \ncontained in the ADB website, news releases, bid invitations in local newspapers \nand  websites,  and  procurement  notices  in  United  Nations  Development \nBusiness;3 \n(iv)  aspects associated with the recruitment of consultants, including registration, \nexpressions  of  interest,  short-listing  procedures,  requests  for  proposals, \npreparation  of  a  competitive  technical  proposal,  preparation  of  a  financial \nproposal, contract negotiations, and contract administration; \n(v)  aspects associated with the procurement of goods and works by the borrower, \nincluding  prequalification,  use  of  standard  bidding  documents,  procurement \nmethods and procedures, preparation of responsive bids, public bid opening, bid \nevaluation, and application of domestic preference; \n(vi)  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, the investigative process and sanctions; \n(vii)  redress procedures; and \n                                                 \n2  A list of countries will be developed during implementation. \n3  Available: http://www.devbusiness.com/ \n ", "  3\n \n(viii)  procedures for the disbursement of funds to suppliers of goods, works, and \nservices. \n \n10.  The target audience will be personnel from manufacturers, suppliers, exporters, trading \nhouses,  contractors  and  consultants,  including  staff  from  universities  and  nongovernment \norganizations who prepare bids and proposals for submission to ADB and its borrowers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent. It will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  It  will  support  approximately  40  seminars  in \ninterested  member  countries  over  a  period  of  3  years.  The  cost  estimate  is  attached  as \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  A request for a seminar on business opportunities usually originates from an interested \nhost organization and is channeled through the Board. In response to such a request, COSO \ncommunicates  with  the  host  organization  and  designs  and  plans  the  seminar  in  close \ncooperation with the organizers to suit their particular needs and preferences. The seminars are \nconducted in English. The standard format recommended by COSO spans 2 days, the first of \nwhich is the seminar and the second individual interviews with the resource speakers. On the \nfirst day, there is usually a morning plenary session, after which the participants divide into two \ngroups: an industry group (contractors, suppliers, and manufacturers) and a consultants group. \nA typical program is contained in Appendix 3. Typical requests to amend this standard format to \nsuit the needs of a particular organization include (i) conducting condensed presentations in \nconsecutive sessions rather than concurrently; (ii) including presentations on ADB's private \nsector and/or cofinancing operations; (iii) emphasizing particular sectors, countries, and topics \nduring the presentations; and (iv) having abbreviated presentations but more and/or longer \nindividual meetings or round table discussions. \n \n13.  The RETA is scheduled to cover a period from September 2006 to December 2009. \nCOSO  will  organize  the  resource  speakers  and  the  RETA  will  cover  their  travel  and \naccommodation  expenses.  COSO  will  also  make  available  seminar  documentation  for  all \nparticipants.  In  coordination  with  resident  missions  and  offices,  where  applicable,  host \norganizers will be responsible for all local arrangements, such as providing conference rooms, \naudiovisual  equipment,  and  secretarial  assistance,  and  the  issuing  of  advertisements  and \ninvitations to interested participants. The host organizers may charge a nominal attendance fee \nto  cover  these  costs, including  rental  of conference  rooms  and  lunch.  Participants  will  be \nresponsible for their own travel and accommodation costs. \n \n14.  Recently,  COSO  has  conducted  several  seminars  on  business  opportunities  where \nrequesting host organizers offered cost-sharing or total cost coverage. This approach will be \nencouraged, particularly for countries requesting frequent seminars.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis \nfor Seminars on Business Opportunities in 2006-2009, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets/  Data Sources/  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nEconomic and efficient  Projects implemented  \u2022  Project completion reports  \u2022  Application and enforcement \ndelivery of quality goods,  economically  and  of fair and transparent \n\u2022  Quarterly procurement \nworks, and consulting  efficiently  procedures \nstatistics prepared by \nservices meeting \nCOSO  \u2022  Effective project monitoring \ninternational standards to \n \nDMCs   \u2022  Bid evaluation reports \nprepared by EAs and \nconsultants \n\u2022  Performance evaluation \nreports of consultants on \ncompletion of services \nOutcome      Assumptions \nSuppliers, manufacturers,  \u2022  Quality of bids and  \u2022  Quarterly procurement  \u2022  ADB-financed contracts are \ncontractors, and  proposals enhanced  statistics prepared by  attractive to the international \nconsultants are aware of  COSO  business community  \n\u2022  Number of \nADB business   \nnonresponsive bids  \u2022  Bid evaluation reports \nopportunities and how to \npursue them  declining  prepared by executing \nagencies and project \nimplementation \nconsultants \n\u2022  Evaluation reports on \nselection of consultants  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
