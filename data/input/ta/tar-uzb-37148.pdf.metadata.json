The Government of Uzbekistan requested the assistance of Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to review the performance and strategy of the agriculture and natural resources sectors. \nThe Fact-Finding Mission visited Uzbekistan from 27 to 31 October 2003, and reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objective, scope, costs, financing, and implementing \narrangements for the technical assistance (TA).1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Uzbekistan's agriculture has changed gradually since the mid-1990s. The sector has \ngradually  reduced  the  state\u2019s  involvement  in  production  of  key  crops  (cotton  and  wheat). \nCollective  and  cooperative  (shirkat)  farms  are  being  restructured  into  private  farms  and \nhousehold (dehkan) plots. The Government recently announced a plan for wide-ranging policy \nreforms. The introduction of market mechanisms in agriculture, however, is still at an early \nstage.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Operational  Strategy  for  Uzbekistan2  identifies  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment as a focal sector for unlocking potential economic growth. Agricultural and rural \ndevelopment are expected to remain the focus in the country strategy and program to be \nprepared by ADB in 2004. Therefore, the strategy, objectives, and components of ADB sector \noperations will need to be revisited to ensure their relevance and coherence. \n \n3.  International  development  organizations  recently  carried  out  several  studies  on \nagriculture. In 2001 the World Bank funded a study on the irrigation and drainage subsector. \nThe study was followed in 2002\u20132003 by water sector analyses carried out for the feasibility \nassessments of the World Bank\u2019s Karshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation Project and ADB\u2019s \nAmu  Zhang  Water  Resources  Project.3  On  agricultural  technology,  in  1996\u20132002  various \nstudies were carried out on the status and challenges in cotton production\u2013the main crop in \nUzbekistan. The studies were made as part of the implementation of the World Bank\u2019s Cotton \nSubsector Improvement Project.4 During the feasibility study of the ADB\u2019s Grain Productivity \nImprovement Project5 in 2001, studies were carried out on the performance and issues in the \nwheat sector\u2013the second most important crop in the country. In 2002 the World Bank funded a \nlivestock sector study.6 Europe Aid commissioned studies in the late 1990s on establishing farm \nmachinery rental enterprises, improving the dissemination of market information, and operations \nof  agricultural  wholesale  markets.  As  regards  policy  studies,  in  2000\u20132003  ADB,  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  and  World  Bank  intensively  assessed  the  evolution  of  the \nagricultural sector policies, particularly the progress in reforms affecting the pricing mechanism \nand state purchase of wheat and cotton.7 In connection with the preparation of its country \neconomic memorandum in 2002, the World Bank evaluated the ongoing farm restructuring \nprocess, which involves the break-up of large farm cooperatives into private household farms. In \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 1 April 2003.  \n2  ADB. 2000.

While  the  studies  provide  insights  into  important  parts  of  the  agriculture  sector, \nconsiderable knowledge gaps remain. These include performance and prospects of crops other \nthan cotton and wheat (e.g., oil and horticulture crops) and challenges in the delivery of farm \ninputs and agrochemicals. The Government and development agencies are also interested in \ndeepening the assessment of the rural finance system, need for infrastructure to market fresh \nproduce (wholesale centers and postharvest storage facilities), capacity of sector institutions, \nand scope for institutional reforms. \n \n5.  In addition to completing the background sector assessments, the Government and \nsector  stakeholders  need  to  improve  the  medium-  to  long-term  development  plan  for  the \nagriculture sector. Development of agricultural sector has been guided by the Program for \nStrengthening  Reforms  in  Agriculture  of  1998  and  the  Presidential  Decree  on  Deepening \nReforms in Agriculture of 2003. Reflecting the major sector concerns, these documents outline \nthree functions for agriculture: (i) generate robust foreign exchange earnings; (ii) improve food \nsecurity; and (iii) enhance rural living standards and ensure social stability. To accomplish these \nbroad  goals,  sector  stakeholders  need  to  identify  and  agree  on  (i)  specific  and  verifiable \nindicators and targets to achieve over the medium to long term, (ii) priority challenges to \nachieving the identified goals, and (iii) actions required to address these challenges. The sector \nplanning process should identify policy issues and priority reforms needed in the sector. The \nexisting agricultural development strategy will particularly benefit from improved definitions of \nsector goals that encompass economic welfare targets (e.g., increase in farm incomes and \nwages,  agricultural  price  stability,  reduced  farm-operating  cost,  and  food  security).  These \nindicators should complement the traditional production-monitoring indicators such as crop and \nlivestock outputs and crop sowing areas.  \n \n6.  Staff  discussions  with  sector  policymakers  have  confirmed  that  the  Government  is \ninterested in conducting a systematic strategic planning exercise for the agriculture sector.  \nConsultations with ADB\u2019s partner development agencies confirmed that a participatory planning \nexercise has not been conducted for the agriculture sector. Progress in policy reforms in the \npast  has  been  hampered  by  incomplete  knowledge  and  concerns  of  sector  stakeholders \nregarding the potential impacts of reforms.9 This has so far impeded the formulation of a plan for \npolicy reforms over the medium term. In light of this issue, support is needed in the sector for \nfacilitation of rigorous and extended policy studies and dialogues to help the Government chart \nits reform program.  \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The  TA  goal  is  to  help  the  Government  improve  its  development  plan  and  policy \nframework for agricultural and rural development. The TA objective is to introduce systematic, \nrigorous, and participatory approaches for strategic planning and policy formulation.  \n \n8.  The expected main TA outputs are (i) an updated sector review covering assessment of \nagriculture sector performance, goals, and challenges; (ii) a draft sector road map; and (iii) \ndeepened dialogue and analysis of key policy issues. The sector review will comprise an update \nof the broad sector status and selected thematic studies on selected topics on subsectors where \ninformation has been lacking (para.10, (i)). The sector road map will recommend a program of \npolicy reforms and priority investments, including their time frame for implementation. The road \nmap will be formulated based on the sector overview paper and stakeholder consensus of the \nsector\u2019s medium- to long-term (5\u201310year) goals and priority challenges. The support for policy \ndialogue will comprise facilitation of extended discussions between a senior policy advisor to be \nengaged under the TA and key policymakers, on major issues that impede policy reforms. The \ndiscussions  will  lead  to  formation  of  a  policy  research  program  and  follow-on  dialogue  to \nadvance sector reforms. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be implemented in a participatory manner to promote a wide recognition of \nTA  outputs  among  the  government  agencies,  external  funding  agencies,  and  other \nstakeholders. In generating the TA outputs, emphasis will be primarily on demonstrating the \nbenefits of improving sector planning processes and policy analysis.  \n \n10.  The TA activities will be grouped into two main parts. The first will focus on formulating \nthe sector road map and comprises three phases: \n \n(i)  Sector Review. The first phase will focus on an overview of agriculture and rural \nsector performance and issues based on available studies and an initial round of \nstakeholder consultations. The broad overview will be complemented by in-depth \nfocus  studies  on  selected  topics,  such  as  prospects  of  crop  diversification, \nchallenges  in  providing  farm  inputs,  and  assessment  of  sector  institutional \narrangements and capacity for medium-term planning (para. 4). The review will also \nreport the initial impact assessments on the ongoing reforms in the cotton and wheat \nmarketing and expansion of areas under private farms. \n \n(ii)  Introduction  of  Planning  Techniques.  The  second  phase  will  comprise  initial \nconsultations between the consultants and key sector planners of the Government. \nThe exercise will familiarize the planners with the strategy formulation tools, such as \nstakeholder-needs analysis, sector road mapping, and problem-tree analysis. The \nexercise should clearly convey the benefits of the participatory process in strategy \nformulation. This exercise will yield the initial outlook on the sector goals, issues, and \npotential solutions.  \n \n \n  \n ", "4   \n(iii)  Strategy  Formulation.  The  third  phase  will  involve  facilitation  of  stakeholder \ndialogue at the regional and central levels (para. 11). The consultations will help \nalign the stakeholder outlook on the priority goals and impediments to agricultural \nand rural development over the medium to long term. These activities will lead to the \nsector  road  map,  which  will  identify  actions  needed  to  remove  rural  sector \nconstraints, including public sector investments, reforms, and capacity building. The \nconsultations should focus on specific actions that can be implemented rather than \non generalized targets. Findings from the stakeholder consultations will be presented \nin a draft final report, to be reviewed at a national workshop. \n \n11.  The  second  part  of  the  TA  activity  will  focus  on  deepening  policy  dialogue.  An \ninternational  policy  advisor,  with  established  reputation  in  agricultural  policy  research  in \ntransition countries, will be engaged. The advisor will assist in reviewing the methodology and \ndraft outputs of part 1 to assure the quality of TA outputs. Over a 12 month period, the advisor \nwill  conduct  periodic  discussions  with  the  national  policymakers  and  analyst,  development \norganizations,  and  other  relevant  stakeholders.  These  discussions  will  aim  to  (i)  ensure \nstakeholder awareness and appreciation of the TA outputs, (ii) provide advisory support to \nclarify issues and key concerns that have impeded agricultural sector reforms, and (iii) provide \nclear and credible lessons learned from market reforms and sector planning experiences in \nother countries. In collaboration with domestic researchers, the advisor will initiate rigorous \npolicy  researches  (impact  analyses  and  simulations),  on  key  policy  topics  of  interest  to \nUzbekistan. These are optimum taxation of cotton, farm inputs subsidies, social equity impacts \nof private farm formation, and additional regulatory reforms required to promote private sector \ninvestments in rural areas. The advisor and Government will also develop a plan to deepen \nsector policy research and dialogue over the medium term. \n \n12.  Consultations  under  the  TA  will  involve  stakeholder  meetings  and  focus  group \ndiscussions in selected regions and in Tashkent. The consultations will involve the central and \nlocal  governments,  private  sector,  research  institutions,  civic  organizations,  farmers\u2019 \nassociations,  and  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  organizations.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented in ways that will promote capacity building of the Ministry of Economy (MOE) and \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  to  coordinate  multidisciplinary  and \nparticipatory  stakeholder  dialogue,  conduct  problem  and  policy  analyses,  and  refine  the \ncountry\u2019s medium-term strategic plan for rural development. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The estimated cost for the TA is $465,000. Of this $325,000 will be provided as a grant \ncovering the entire amount of foreign exchange of $248,000 and a part of the local costs of \n$77,000. The Government will provide in-kind counterpart contribution, valued at $140,000, to \nthe TA in the form of office facilities for the consultants, staff resources at the central and \nregional levels, data, and reports necessary for the TA studies. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MOE. To supervise the TA implementation, a \nworking group chaired by the deputy minister of economy will be formed with membership of \nsenior  staff  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  MAWR,  MOE,  Ministry  of  Finance,  other  relevant \ngovernment agencies, research institutes, and farmers\u2019 associations. The working group will \nreport to the first deputy prime minister and minister of economy.  ", "      5 \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from April 2004 to March 2005. Part 1 \n(para. 10) will be carried out from April to August 2004, while part 2 will occupy the entire \nduration of TA implementation. For part 1, inception, interim, and draft final and final reports will \nbe prepared 3.0 weeks, 3.0 months, 4.5 months, and 5.0 months, respectively, after consultant \nmobilization.  For  part  2,  the  interim  and  final  reports  will  be  prepared  7  and  12  months, \nrespectively, after the TA starts.10  \n \n16.  A total of 8 person-months of international consulting services will be engaged under the \nTA.  Six  person-months  of  agricultural  economist  and  institution  specialist  services  will  be \nrequired for part 1. Two person-months of services of a senior policy advisor with expertise in \nagricultural policy reform (para. 11) will be needed for part 2. A total of 11 person-months of \nlocal  consulting  services  with  expertise  in  institutional  assessment  and  strategic  planning, \nagricultural sciences, and economics will also be required (Appendix 3). The consultants will be \nengaged on an individual basis according to the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian \nDevelopment Bank and its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory for the recruitment of \ndomestic  consultants.
