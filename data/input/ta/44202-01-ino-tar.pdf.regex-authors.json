INTRODUCTION \n1.  During a mission fielded in August 2010, the Government of Indonesia and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) agreed on the objective, scope, and implementation and financing \narrangements  for  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs). The TA is designed to support the realization of the impacts and outcomes \nof the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP).1 The IRSDP highlights a \nnumber of important gaps that need to be resolved to make the overall program fully effective, \nparticularly in preparing and structuring PPP projects with government contracting agencies \n(GCAs). The TA will provide capacity development assistance to bridge these gaps. The TA is \nin  line  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Indonesia,2 and  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework expectation for greater ADB involvement in private sector development.3 The design \nand monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Significant  infrastructure  investment  requirements.  Following  the  Asian  financial \ncrisis, Indonesia cancelled or suspended many of its planned public and private infrastructure \nprojects. Infrastructure investment has since fallen from approximately 6% of gross domestic \nproduct to a low of 2% of GDP in 2000, before recovering to the current level of 4% of gross \ndomestic product. Despite this improvement, infrastructure investment is still low by international \nstandards, with levels tending to be in the range of 6%\u20147% for high growth economies in Asia.5 \nThe government is seeking to mobilize approximately $140 billion of investment in infrastructure \nover the next 5 years.  \n \n3.  Public sector constraints. The ability of the public sector to meet these investment \nrequirements  is  limited  by  its  macroeconomic  objectives  to  keep  public  sector  debt  at  a \nsustainable level and reduce its fiscal deficit. Reflecting these constraints, the government \nanticipates that approximately 60% of its planned infrastructure financing requirements will be \nsourced from the private sector.  \n \n4.  ADB assistance. The government recognizes that private sector participation cannot be \ntaken for granted, and that major structural and institutional reforms are needed. The IRSDP \nsupports a comprehensive medium-term reform agenda that has been successful in opening \ninfrastructure to private sector participation. The third and final subprogram loan for the IRSDP \nis being presented to the ADB Board of Directors for approval in December 2010.  \n \n5.  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Financing  Facility.  In  2009,  as  part  of  the  overall  PPP \ndevelopment  framework,  the  government  and  other  development  partners  established  PT \nIndonesia Infrastructure Finance, which is an infrastructure financing company. The company is \nexpected to have a loan portfolio of up to $1.0 billion by 2014. ADB has contributed up to $40 \nmillion of equity, and provided a sovereign loan of up to $100 million to finance the company. PT \nSarana  Multi  Infrastruktur  (Persero)  (SMI),  a  state-owned  entity,  is  a  shareholder  of  PT \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  assumes  the  role  of  the \nshareholder in SMI, representing the government. \n \n6.  Constraints for project development. While the government has developed a number \nof PPP projects, they have not attracted significant market interest. The main constraints for \nproject development relate to (i) the government\u2019s inability to acquire land in the public interest; \n(ii) lack of policy clarity on public sector support for PPP projects; and (iii) lack of effective \ninstitutional  arrangements  to  properly  prepare,  implement,  monitor,  and  ensure  contract \ncompliance for PPPs. The government has taken various actions to resolve these issues: \n \n(i)  Land acquisition. With ADB assistance, the government is in the final stage of \nformulating a draft land acquisition law that is expected to be considered by \nParliament in early 2011.6 The new law will provide enhanced legal framework for \nthe government to acquire land for infrastructure projects.  \n \n(ii)  Government support. The government has addressed the second constraint of \nproviding  public  sector  support  for  PPPs  by  enacting  a  regulation,  MOF \nregulation Number 38/PMK.01/2006, allowing the government to mitigate political, \ndemand, and project performance risks associated with PPP projects through the \nInfrastructure Guarantee Facility, recently established by MOF.  \n \n(iii)  Project preparation. ADB is providing assistance to address the third constraint \nof  poor  project  preparation  by  providing  the  National  Development  Planning \nAgency  (BAPPENAS)  with  a  loan  under  the  IRSDP  to  establish  a  project \ndevelopment facility to prepare and transact PPP projects.  \n \n7.  Future requirements. Despite these efforts, few PPP projects are being developed. \nWhile land acquisition and government support constraints are being resolved, concerns about \nproject design, preparation, and implementation continue. To date, the Project Development \nFacility has had difficulty developing project structures that are efficient and effective, attractive \nto private financiers, and affordable to government. These difficulties are arising due to factors \nsuch  as  limited  awareness  in  Indonesia  of  alternative  types  of  PPP  structures  being \nimplemented in countries such as Australia, India, and Singapore. \n \n8.  Based on international best practice, a wide range of possible PPP structures could be \nused in Indonesia to address the needs of both the government and the private sector. Their \nuse requires a project evaluation methodology that develops project structures that demonstrate \nvalue for money, are bankable, and are affordable to government. This methodology needs to \nreconcile the technical and cost aspects of projects to the government relative to financial \nrequirements of financiers and lenders, and affordability constraints of government. The PPP \nmethodology  needs  to  be  embedded  in  a  project  design,  preparation,  and  implementation \nprocess that clearly defines and fully integrates the roles of BAPPENAS, MOF, the Investment \nCoordinating Board (BKPM), and prospective GCAs. As GCAs will be signatories to long-term \ncontracts for up to 20\u201325 years, they need to take responsibility for initiating PPP contracts and \ntake the lead in structuring, implementing, and managing the projects. This means that GCAs \nneed to understand the nature of project structuring and implementation processes, and access \nassistance to increase their awareness of the methodologies and options available to develop \nand implement successful PPP projects. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved national and regional provision of infrastructure \nand delivery of services by selected GCAs through the use of PPPs. The TA will support the \ngovernment in preparing PPP projects that are economically sound, financially attractive to \nprivate sector financiers, and affordable to government.  \n \n10.  The outcome of the project will be improved capacity of GCAs to develop, implement, \nand  monitor  infrastructure  PPP  projects.  This  will  support  the  government\u2019s  objective  of \nincreasing  the  number  and  value  of  commercially  attractive  and  sustainable  PPP  projects \noffered by GCAs to the private sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be comprised of a preparatory stage, followed by the delivery of the following \noutputs: \n \n(i)   strengthened institutional capacity of selected GCAs to select and design PPP \nproject structures and implementation processes; \n(ii)  development  of  two  examples  of  best  practice  PPP  structures  and \nimplementation processes; and \n(iii)  increased awareness of GCAs on the requirements to prepare efficient, bankable, \nand affordable PPP projects. \n \n12.  Project preparation. The TA consultants will review existing PPP projects in Indonesia \nand  studies  prepared  by  consultants  financed  under  the  IRSDP  to  identify  lessons  from \nsuccessful PPP projects, and the reasons for their success. The TA consultants will liaise with a \nbroad group of stakeholders including GCAs, private sector investors, legal firms, commercial \nbanks, and the Infrastructure Guarantee Facility to identify a list of candidate PPP projects. The \nTA will target the priority subsectors of power, roads, water, and waste management; and \nidentify two pilot projects. The consultants will apply an agreed list of criteria to identify two \nsuitable pilot projects. The following criteria will be used to select the two pilot projects: (i) \nfacilitates policy and institutional reform; (ii) reflects the government\u2019s planning requirements; (iii) \nGCA commitment and readiness; (iv) project readiness; (v) project replication potential; and (vi) \npotential for catalyzing private sector interest and commercial financing. They will then prepare \nan implementation plan to develop institutional capacity within the selected GCAs, and submit \nthe findings in an inception report.  \n \n13.  Strengthened institutional capacity of selected GCAs to select and design PPP \nproject  structures  and  implementation  processes.  The  consultants  will  work  with  the \nselected GCAs to develop good governance institutional structures for project preparation, \nimplementation, and management. They will help the selected GCAs identify and select relevant \nstaff to be responsible for PPP activities, examine capacity building and training needs, prepare \nguidelines,  and  provide  training  in  project  preparation  and  contract  management.  The \narrangements will be detailed in an institutional capacity building report. \n \n14.  Development of two examples of best practice PPP structures and implementation \nprocesses. The TA consultants will work with the GCA project preparation teams responsible \nfor the design, preparation, transaction, and management of the PPP projects. The consultants \n ", "4   \nwill help develop Outline Business Cases (OBCs) that address the following three interlinked \nactivities of a PPP project: \n \n(i)  Technical analysis. This involves the assessment of project rationale, market \nanalysis,  output  specification,  viability  and  validity  of  feasibility  and/or \nprefeasibility reports, estimates of project costs and benefits, site enablement \nanalysis,  social  and  environmental  safeguards  assessments,  legal  review  of \nassets  and  functions,  economic  analysis,  and  stakeholder  review  to  confirm \nproject attractiveness. \n(ii)  Procurement analysis. Develop a financial model; and assess procurement and \nfinancial  options  based  on  criteria  of  value  for  money,  bankability,  and \naffordability. Conduct government support analysis, and identify a proposed risk \nallocation structure. Conduct market sounding to confirm the project\u2019s financial \nparameters, and evaluate legal and institutional requirements to establish the \nproposed PPP structure. \n(iii)  Project implementation requirements. Develop a project preparation plan to \naddress site enablement issues, and confirm the government\u2019s willingness and \ncapacity  to  provide  support  to  the  projects. Review  requirements  to  prepare  \n(i) bid documents (request for qualification and request for proposal), and draft \ncontractual terms; (ii) project pre-bid consultations; (iii) bidder qualification and \nbid evaluation criteria; (iv) detailed output specification, performance indicators, \nand monitoring and evaluation frameworks; (v) required due diligence documents \nand online data requirements; (vi) assistance required for the bid process, bid \nevaluation,  and  contract  negotiation;  (vii)  terms  of  reference  for  transaction \nadvisors;  and  (viii)  institutional  requirements  within  GCAs  to  implement  the \ntransaction and manage the PPP contract. \n \n15.  Increased awareness of GCAs on the requirements to prepare efficient, bankable, \nand affordable PPP projects. The OBCs and supporting materials will provide the GCAs with a \nset of project evaluation tools, a methodology, checklists, and an implementation process that \nwill allow them to develop PPP capacity within the respective GCAs. These case studies, tools, \nand materials will be disseminated to MOF, BAPPENAS, BKPM, and representative GCAs \nthrough a series of workshops. \n \n16.  Assumptions and risks. The design of the TA is based on the assumptions that the \ngovernment will continue its commitment to pursue development policy to support infrastructure-\nled growth, to make government guarantees available, and to have the ability to procure land. In \naddition, sustained fiscal resources must be available for project support. Critical risks include \nthe possibility that the government does not enact a new land acquisition law or establish a \ngovernment guarantee facility; slow economic growth that affects business confidence and \ninterest in PPPs, and reduced government buy-in during TA implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $550,000  equivalent,  of  which  $500,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), \nand administered by ADB. The government will finance the remaining $50,000 equivalent in \nkind. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  SMI will be the executing agency for the TA. SMI is a state-owned entity, in which MOF \nrepresents the government as shareholder. A steering committee chaired by the SMI president \ndirector will be established with representatives from ADB, MOF, BAPPENAS, and BKPM as \nmembers.  The  steering  committee  will  review  and  approve  the  TA  implementation  plan \nprepared at the end of phase 1 (project screening), and meet on a quarterly basis to provide \noversight, monitoring, and guidance on TA issues.  \n \n19.  Screening of project proposals. SMI will screen the project proposals with assistance \nfrom the consultants, based on a project proposal application form submitted by the GCAs. After \nSMI  evaluation  and  approval,  the  GCA  will  enter  into  a  project-specific  memorandum  of \nunderstanding with ADB that defines the use of the funds under the TA and the obligations of \nthe GCA to support the project.  \n \n20.  Procurement. A team of international and national consultants (firm and/or individuals) \nwill implement the TA activities and will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The consultants will be requested to \nfield a multidisciplinary team to provide financial, commercial, technical (engineering), economic, \nsocial,  environmental,  legal,  and  procurement  services.  Outline  terms  of  reference  are \npresented in Appendix 3. The consultants will be paid lump sum amounts in accordance with TA \ncontract milestones. The GCAs will be required to provide office space, furniture, and logistical \nand administrative support. The TA will be implemented from December 2010 to December \n2011. All equipment and software will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), and will be handed over to the government \nupon completion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  Consultant reports. The consultants will undertake a screening process of a list of \npotential PPP projects provided by ADB and SMI; and within 3 weeks of the start of the TA, \nprepare  an  inception  report  that  describes  the  approach,  timelines,  and  required  approval \nstages.  The  consultants  will  conduct  an  institutional  review,  produce  project  preparation \nguidelines, and submit an institutional capacity building report. The consultants will prepare a \ndraft OBC report for each project. The consultants will then prepare a draft final TA report that \ncollates the documents, tools, and methodologies used to prepare the OBCs to form a PPP \ntoolkit and provide a series of workshop training programs. Workshops will be conducted with \nrepresentatives from SMI, BAPPENAS, MOF, BKPM, and the representative GCAs. Following \nfeedback  from  the  workshop  participants  the  consultants  will  finalize  the  TA  report  and \nsupporting documents. SMI will disseminate the TA reports at the end of the assignment; project \nevaluation results will be made publicly available on ADB\u2019s website. The TA documents will be \nhoused with SMI and used to guide the development of subsequent PPP projects. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof the Republic of Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Capacity Development Assistance for Public\u2013Private Partnerships, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved national and  Private investment in  Review reports,  Continued commitment \nregional provision of  infrastructure using PPPs  statistics, and surveys  from the government to \ninfrastructure and  increased by $30 million\u2013 from local  pursue development \ndelivery of services  $100 million within selected  governments and  policy of infrastructure-\n  GCAs from a baseline of  central line ministries  led growth \nzero within 5 years of   \ncompletion of the TA  Availability of \ngovernment guarantees \nand ability of \ngovernment to procure \nland \n \nRisks \nGovernment does not \nenact new land law or \nestablish government \nguarantee facility \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved capacity to  PPP structures and project  Annual budget reports  Sustained fiscal \ndevelop, implement,  preparation process agreed  of national and  resources for project \nand monitor  and understood by the  regional governments  development support  \ninfrastructure PPP  executing agency, GCAs \nRisks \nprojects under various  and other PPP \nforms of government  stakeholders by completion  Slow economic growth \nsupport  of the TA.   affects business \n.  confidence and private \nsector interest in PPP \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
