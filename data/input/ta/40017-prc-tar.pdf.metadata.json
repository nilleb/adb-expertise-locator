During the Country Program Midterm Review in November 2005, the Government of the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare the Qingdao Water Resources Management Project .1 The \nconcept clearance was approved by the Vice President in February 2006. During the 2006 \nCountry Programming Review Mission, the Government confirmed its request. In July 2006, the  \nFact-Finding Mission was fielded to assess the results of available studies and determine the \nscope of the TA. The Mission held discussions with representatives of the Government and \nthose of Qingdao Municipality in Shandong province. Understanding was reached on the TA \nimpact, outcome, output, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and the \nconsultant's terms of reference. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC economy has grown rapidly since 1978, starting its gradual transition from a \ncentrally planned to a market economy. Over the past three decades, PRC has maintained \ngross domestic product growth of about 9% per annum, and lifted 450 million people out of \nabsolute poverty. Despite this rapid economic growth, about 135 million people still live on \n$1/day and about 500 million live on less than $2/day. Therefore, poverty reduction remains the \nmajor focus of the Government. The PRC also faces daunting challenges in maintaining rapid \neconomic growth and employment generation; managing resource demands and environmental \nconsequences of rapid industrialization; and addressing the resulting income inequalities. \n3.  Qingdao, the host city for the 29th Olympic Sailing Regatta in 2008, is a coastal city \nsituated by the Yellow Sea on the east and south, adjoins the cities of Yantai, Rizhao, and \nWeifang to the northeast, southwest, and west, respectively, and faces People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Korea, and Japan across the sea. Qingdao is a major city for \nfinance  and  foreign  trade  in  Shandong  Province.  Some  local  companies,  such  as  Haier, \nHisense, Tsingtao Brewery and Aucma, are recognized worldwide. Qingdao has established \nextensive  connections  with  foreign  countries  and  organizations  for  economic  cooperation, \nresulting in a stable economic growth, increase in foreign direct investment, and trade. The total \narea of Qingdao Municipality is 10,654 square kilometers (km2) with the urban area totaling \n1,102 km2. Its population  is 7.10 million, of whom 2.38 million are urban dwellers.  \n4.  With rapid urban development and population growth, water shortages as well as regular \nflooding  have  become  key  constraints  to  sustainable  development.  To  overcome  these \nconstraints, the Qingdao municipal government (QMG) intends to (i) expand and conserve the \nJiaozhou Bay and Dagu River wetlands in Jiaozhou county\u2014located northwest of Qingdao City; \nand (ii) improve water availability on a sustainable basis by developing Quanxinhe Dam in \nLaoshan district\u2014located southeast of Qingdao city. Both are geographically and hydrologically \nseparate and distinct subprojects. \n \n5.  There is an urgent need to protect the lower parts of Jiaozhou City from Dagu River \nfloods, and the wetlands from the negative impact of rapid urban, industrial, and agricultural \ndevelopment from the surrounding areas. These are the only wetlands in Qingdao Municipality \nidentified in the national wetland protection list. The wetlands, located within the Jiaozhou Bay \neconomic zone, are home to 156 species of waterfowl, of which 21 fall under special State \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 August 2006. \n ", "2   \nprotection. More than 10 species are globally endangered. Wetland pollution has caused severe \ndamage to the local environment, resulting in degradation of wildlife habitat and a sharply \ndeclining number of wildlife species, and impairing ecosystem functions. Jiaozhou City, located \nin the southern part of the Dagu River Basin, is frequently exposed to floods. There is a \nproposal to construct an artificial lake of approximately 8 km2 in surface area with an average \ndepth of 2.7 meters (m). The lake will aid in flood retention as well as serve as a multipurpose \nreservoir to supply water to the surrounding wetlands for the upkeep of their ecological function. \nSurplus water will be diverted for industrial and agricultural uses. The total area is spread over \n96 km2. \n \n6.  A prefeasibility study report (PFSR) for the Jiaozhou wetlands subproject has been \nprepared. The Jiaozhou county administration intends to develop part of the lakeshore as \nrecreational park, and business and residential areas. The proposed interventions will include \nrealignment  of  the  Dagu  River  course,  construction  of  a  flood-retention  lake,  hydraulic \ninfrastructures for wetland conservation, a sewage treatment plant, and afforestation. The total \ninvestment cost of the Jiaozhou wetlands subproject is estimated at $104 million.  \n \n7.  The objective of the second subproject\u2014Quanxinhe Dam\u2014is to increase the quantity, \nquality, and reliability of the water supply in Laoshan district. A new dam will be constructed to \nreplace the existing 40-m-high stone-arch dam. The existing dam was constructed 35 years ago \nand is considered unsafe. Water leakages through the dam structure have been observed \nrecently. The stored water will be primarily supplied to 50,000 inhabitants of the coastal villages \nand towns for domestic use. Currently, these communities get 60% of their water supplies from \nsurface water and the remaining 40% from groundwater sources. Surplus water from the dam \nwill be used for irrigation in the surrounding areas. The proposed new 76-m-high concrete-faced \nrockfill dam will be constructed 150 m downstream of the existing one and about 500 m from the \ncoastline. The new reservoir will have a storage capacity of 6.83 million cubic meters with a \nsurface area of 180,000 m2. \n \n8.  There are no human activities in the catchment area (12 km2) upstream of the dam site. \nTherefore, the water quality is good. The material for dam construction (granite rocks) will be \nlargely  taken  from  the  catchment  area  and  from  the  bottom  of  the  existing  reservoir.  \nGeotechnical investigations have not revealed any seepage in the area of the new dam site. A \nPFSR for the dam design and construction was prepared in 2004. The environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) will be completed in 2006. The dam site lies within the Laoshan National Park. \nQMG  will  initiate  the  approval  process  for  change  in  land  use\u2014expected  to  result  from \nexpansion in the reservoir area\u2014from concerned agencies once the EIA has been completed. \nThe total cost of the Quanxinhe Dam subproject is estimated at $32 million.  \n \n9.  Despite the growing capacity of different water sector agencies and departments in \nQMG, the integrated water resource management (IWRM) approach has not yet been adopted \nto address related issues. Therefore, the existing institutional arrangements\u2014to develop and \nmanage water resources\u2014require an appropriate framework to operate coherently. Important \naspects of water policy have continually been improved but the enforcement, particularly of \nwastewater disposal and water quality, remains weak. With rapid urban and industrial growth in  \nQingdao municipality sustainable and efficient management of water resources has become a \nmajor challenge. Adoption of the IWRM approach along with further improvement in institutional \ncapacity of water sector agencies is imperative to sustain rapid economic growth and reduce \npoverty. \n \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will help QMG prepare an investment proposal to develop and better manage its \nwater resources. The outcome of the TA will be an agreement with the Government on project \ndesign,  feasibility  study  reports  (FSR)  for  both  subprojects,  and  project  implementation \narrangements.  The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The output of the TA will include (i) a review of the design for an artificial lake and \ndevelopment plans for the Jiaozhou wetlands including wastewater treatment, afforestation, and \nbiodiversity conservation; (ii) a review of the design for Quanxinhe Dam; (iii) additional technical \nstudies/tests, if required; (iv) analysis of the economic and financial viability of both subprojects; \n(v)  preparation  of  the  project  cost  estimates;  (vi)  a  review  of  current  water  management \npractices  and  institutional  arrangements,  and  development  of  an  IWRM  plan;  and  (vii) \npreparation of safeguard documents, i.e., EIA, and resettlement plans (RPs) according to ADB \npolicies and guidelines. \n \n12.  PFSRs  of  both  subprojects  have  been  prepared  but  require  a  detailed  review  to \ndetermine  their  respective  objectives  and  institutional  arrangements.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented in two phases. In phase 1, a detailed technical review of both PFSRs will be \ncarried out and subsector analysis accomplished. Institutional review will also be undertaken to \nestablish an IWRM framework. Phase 2 will assist QMG in preparing comprehensive FSRs as \nwell as the requisite EIAs, environmental management plan (EMP), and RPs following the \nGovernment and ADB policies and guidelines.  \n \n13.  The TA\u2014in accordance with international best practices\u2014will analyze (i) the hydrology \nof Jiaozhou Bay wetlands and Dagu River system in light of the proposed interventions; (ii) the \nhydrology of Quanxinhe Dam, considering probable maximum flood and maximum historic \nreturn-flow; (iii) soil and geotechnical conditions of the Quanxinhe reservoir site; (iv) engineering \ndesigns of both subprojects; (v) cost estimates; and (vi) economic and financial viability of the \nproject. Studies and investigations/tests\u2014in addition to the work carried out by the design \ninstitutes and the Water Conservancy Bureau\u2014will be undertaken, if required. \n \n14.  To help QMG adopt the IWRM approach, and to ensure that a wide range of issues and \nstakeholder interests are considered, the TA will review available information on the Dagu River \nsystem and analyze the current institutional framework for water resource management and \nwater tariff policy. Based on this analysis\u2014and a review of the existing watershed conditions\u2014\nthe  TA  will  develop  a  river  basin  management  plan  focusing  on  land  use,  water  quality, \nwastewater treatment, discharge practices, as well as conservation of the wetlands ecosystem. \n \n15.  Laoshan  district  aims  to  sustainably  increase  water  availability  and  agricultural \nproductivity  in  the  area  by  developing  key  hydraulic  structures.  Quanxinhe  Dam,  and  the \nassociated water supply to the coastal villages and towns, will be the largest infrastructure \ndevelopment to regulate flows in Laoshan district. However, there are other smaller reservoirs \nplanned\u2014outside  the  scope  of  this  Project\u2014or  even  constructed  within  the  valleys  of  the \nLaoshan  district.  Given  that  the  project  area  is  supported  by  different  river  systems  and \nhydraulic structures, water resources management cannot be optimized by Quanxinhe Dam \nalone without considering the runoff regime of adjacent river systems on a real-time basis as \n ", "4   \nwell as the operation of other existing and planned water control structures on those rivers. \nTechnological advancements in hydrologic data collection, stream-flow forecasting, modeling, \nand  computer  technology  can  provide  opportunities  for  adjusting  daily  reservoir  operation \naccording to the actual water demands.  \n \n16.  With effective use of real-time data and computer models, the operation of Quanxinhe \nDam can be upgraded to provide operators with a decision support system by which reservoir \nwater releases would be optimized to meet water requirements downstream. Adopting an IWRM \napproach  and  optimizing  associated  water  storage  and  diversion  structures  operation  can  \nenhance operational efficiency in the following areas: (i) real-time reservoir operation at the \nbasin-level including tributaries and dams; (ii) integrated management of all water sources \nincluding dams, rivers/traditional canals, groundwater, drainage water, and treated wastewater; \nand  (iii)  enhanced  (irrigation)  water  demand  management.  The  TA  will  propose  an  IWRM \napproach for the project area including a survey of current status of water use/consumption and \na projection of future water demand for the subsectors. The TA will prepare monthly basin water \nallocation plans, using scenario analysis. These scenarios will consider domestic water supply, \nirrigation, and environmental water demands over the envisaged project life span.  \n \n17.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), the TA will conduct EIAs and prepare a report as well as a summary EIA \nreport. The summary EIA report will be disclosed to the public 120 days before  the Board \nconsiders  the  loan  project.  Necessary  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  monitoring \nrequirements will be incorporated into the EMP. The EMP will also recommend appropriate \ninstitutional- and capacity-building components for monitoring mechanisms. \n \n18.  In the wetlands subproject, the key objective is to protect the lower parts of Jiaozhou \nCity from Dagu River floods. The Water Resources Bureau of Qingdao Municipality will take the \nlead  in  subproject  formulation  and  implementation.  However,  closer  consultations  with  the \nForest and Environmental Protection Bureau are needed. While preparing the EIAs, the TA will \nidentify potential impacts of subproject activities on wetlands and design mitigation measures by \nassessing  (i)  the  operation  of  the  artificial  lake  as  a  sustainable  ecosystem;  (ii)  potential \nsaltwater  intrusion, sedimentation, and nutrient loading on the lake operation and water quality; \n(iii) changes in flood patterns due to the operation of the lake; (iv) wetlands ecosystem, i.e., \naquatic habitats, fish diversity, and terrestrial biodiversity; and (v) the related social impacts. The \nTA will further examine to what extent the currently designed subproject activities will affect \n(both positively and negatively) wetlands conservation, and determine the overall objective of \nthe subproject intervention. To this end, an analysis of how the wetlands conservation master \nplan and flood control actions could complement each other will also be analyzed.  \n \n19.  As the height of the Quanxinhe Dam crest is designed at 76 m above the ground (or 106 \nm above sea level), the Project will be classified as Category A in accordance with ADB\u2018s \nenvironmental policy. As the dam site lies within the Laoshan National Park and the provincial \nnature reserve, competent national agencies will be consulted. A draft EIA is being prepared by \nQingdao Environmental Institute. Public opinion has also been sought through a questionnaire \nsurvey. Under the TA, a more detailed stakeholder consultation with government agencies, local \nnongovernment organizations, research institutes, and affected people will be undertaken. \n \n20.  Since the Quanxinhe Dam will be built just 150 m downstream of the existing one, \nresettlement is not an issue. However, about 41 hectares (ha) of land will have to be acquired. \nIn the Jiaozhou wetlands subproject, an estimated 1,500 people (in 5 villages) will have to be \nmoved, and about 1,000 ha of land acquired. The TA will prepare detailed land acquisition and ", "  5\nRPs complying with Government and ADB safeguard policies. There are no ethnic minorities in \neither of the subproject areas. The initial poverty and social analysis framework is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $850,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $600,000 to cover most of the TA costs. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining $250,000 \nequivalent through in-kind contributions by preparing FSR, and providing counterpart staff and \noffice  accommodation  to  TA  consultants.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants, engaged through a firm, with \nexperience in (i) water resources, institutional, economic, and financial analyses; (ii) water \nresources  planning;  (iii)  hydrology;  (iv)  structural  engineering;  (v)  wetland  ecology;  (vi) \nenvironmental management; (vii) dam safety; (viii) fisheries and forestry; (ix) resettlement and \nland acquisition planning; and (x) social development. The TA will require 16 person-months  \ninternational  and  36  person-months  national  consulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for  engaging  \nnational consultants. The consulting firm will be selected by (i) inviting simplified technical \nproposals;  and  (ii)  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented in two phases over 7 months. There will be a break of 1 month between the  \nphases for a detailed review of phase 1 outputs by the Government and ADB to determine \nwhether to proceed to phase 2 . Tripartite meetings will be held after the consultants submit the  \ninception, midterm (at end of phase 1), and draft final reports. Outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. The vehicle and equipment provided for the consultants\u2019 work \nunder the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and will be \nhanded over to the Executing Agency upon completion of the TA. The TA is expected to start in \nFebruary 2007 and be completed in October 2007. \n \n23.  The Qingdao Development and Reform Commission will be the Executing Agency. One \nproject implementation unit each in Jiaozhou county and Laoshan district will be set up\u2014 \nheaded by a respective project manager. A project steering committee will be set up\u2014headed \nby Qingdao Development and Reform Commission and with representatives from Jiaozhou \ncounty and Laoshan district\u2014to support the consultants and ensure timely preparation of the \nProject. ADB will provide close supervision by fielding review missions at major TA milestones\u2014\ninception, midterm review at the end of phase 1, and draft final report review before the end of \nphase 2\u2014and extending regular backstopping from both the headquarters and the resident \nmission.  \n \nIV.

Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nBasic poverty and social analysis is proposed (Appendix 4). The technical assistance (TA) will assess the incidence of \npoverty using existing data sources, supplemented by a social survey of potential beneficiaries. Both income and non-\nincome poverty indexes will be determined. The analysis will be carried out following the Handbook on Poverty and \nSocial Analysisa and Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact on Economic Analysis of Projects.b Particular attention \nwill be given to (i) profiling the beneficiaries, including gender-disaggregated demographic, economic, and social data, \nwhere possible; (ii) determining the incidence of poverty; and (iii) identifying vulnerable groups and any adverse \nimpacts anticipated from the Project.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA stakeholder analysis will be prepared as part of the TA. Participatory on-site consultations and workshops will be \nheld to strengthen the participatory approach. A workshop will be held for stakeholders to discuss and agree on the \nproposed scope and designs of subprojects. More intensive focus group meetings, interviews, and surveys will be held \nwith local government agencies, development partners, and nongovernment organizations, the private sector, and \nidentified project beneficiaries to ensure a sense of ownership and agreement with the detailed design and \nimplementation arrangements. Funds are being made available under the TA to ensure that an effective stakeholder \nanalysis is undertaken. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nA participation strategy will be prepared as part of the TA. The strategy will aim to ensure the involvement of local \ngovernment and communities, particularly the poor, women, and vulnerable groups throughout project design and \nimplementation.
