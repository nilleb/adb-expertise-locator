INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Developing Asia led the world recovery from the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis. Asia\u2019s \neconomic growth rebounded strongly and has remained robust since 2010. In contrast, the \nsluggish economic recovery and problems faced in advanced economies\u2014earthquake-ravaged \nJapan, the fiscal conundrum in the United States, and the worsening eurozone sovereign debt \ncrisis\u2014have unsettled markets and increased uncertainty over the economic prognosis in the \nmedium term. Moreover, on its current trajectory Asia's growth could result in Asia generating \nmore than half of global output by 2050 and boosting current living standards in Asia six-fold.1 In \nshort, as the economic focus shifts toward Asia, so too will global voice and influence. Asia must \nassume greater responsibility in helping to manage change in a new world economic order. To \ndo this, and to sustain economic growth and development both globally and regionally, Asia \nneeds to define, clarify, and substantiate its position on a multitude of issues on the international \npolicy agenda.  \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) will increase the capacity of Asia\u2019s policy makers (and \ntheir constituents) to contribute to and participate constructively in international dialogue on the \npolicies needed to meet global economic challenges. The TA will provide Asia\u2019s policy makers \nand the public with expert analysis and proposals on critical issues challenging economies at \nthe global, regional, and national level.2 These analyses and proposals, crafted from a regional \nperspective, will focus on issues pertaining specifically to the needs of Asian economies, while \nat the same time considering the region\u2019s increasing links with the global economy. The TA will \nprovide  inputs  to  forum  discussions  such  as  the  Group  of  Twenty  (G-20),  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN),3 ASEAN+3,4 East Asia Summit, and Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation (APEC), as well as to country-level discussions in developing member countries of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). It will also provide Asia with policy proposals for collective \naction,  thus  promoting regional  cooperation.  By  assembling  a  broad and  diverse group of \nexperts steered by a prominent research institute, the TA will be able to foster intellectual \ndialogue and debate on policies to meet critical global economic challenges, and therefore \nbetter inform policy makers and the public. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Global economic challenges and opportunities are in a continuous state of flux, testing \nthe global economy\u2019s capacity to adapt to evolving risks and priorities. The recent financial crisis \nled to a major reassessment of the global economic and financial architecture, and calls for \nmore sustainable and inclusive growth in the face of a changing natural environment have \ngathered momentum.6 This changing global landscape requires a synthesis of regional and \nglobal solutions. This TA will focus on three major critical issues: (i) global rebalancing and \nsustainable growth, (ii) regional cooperation in a global context, and (iii) green growth and \nsustainable development. With an emphasis on Asia, the TA will examine these issues in \ngreater detail and prepare policy recommendations for discussion in regional and global policy \nforums. \n \n                                                \n1 Kohli et al., eds. 2011. Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century. Manila: ADB. \n2 In this TA, Asia refers to ADB\u2019s 48 regional members.  \n3 ASEAN consists of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n4 ASEAN+3 consists of the ASEAN countries plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n5 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 August 2011. \n6 J. Sachs et al., eds. 2010. The Future Global Reserve System\u2014an Asian Perspective. Manila: ADB; and ADB. \n2008. Technical Assistance for South Asia Forum on the Impact of Global Economic and Financial Crisis. Manila \n(TA 6508-REG, $800,000, approved on 12 December). \n ", "2  \n4.  Global  structural  imbalances  in  trade  and  financial  flows\u2014and  the  associated \nunprecedented accumulation of international reserves by developing countries (especially in \nAsia)\u2014played an important role in the recent crisis. Two years after the global crisis, the \nrecovery in advanced economies\u2015still repairing balance sheets and deleveraging household \ndebt\u2015remains anemic, and could remain sluggish due to continuing fiscal and sovereign debt \nissues. In contrast, emerging economies, particularly in developing Asia, are seeing robust \ngrowth. With the current economic woes in advanced economies, however, an Asian growth \nparadigm that relies heavily on export demand is no longer viable. Rebalancing sources of \ngrowth from exports to domestic demand is therefore critical for Asia. Not only will rebalancing \nhelp insulate Asia from future external economic shocks, it will also help foster a stronger, more \nvibrant, and more resilient global economy. Indeed, this rebalancing has started, with economic \ngrowth relying more on developing Asia\u2019s domestic and regional demand and less on demand \nfrom advanced economies. \n \n5.  Rebalancing for a stronger, more sustainable, and more balanced global economy will \nrequire  a  series  of  domestic  structural  reforms  that  promote  domestic  spending,  increase \nintraregional trade within Asia and trade with other emerging economies, and intensify regional \nand global policy coordination. The TA will focus on macroeconomic aspects of rebalancing and \nwill attempt to resolve the following crucial questions: \n(i)  How will global rebalancing evolve after the global financial crisis?  \n(ii)  How  will  Asian  economies  that  are  overly  reliant  on  exports  rebalance  their \nsources of growth?  \n(iii)  How can regional cooperation stimulate intraregional trade and regional demand?  \n(iv)  How can global cooperation\u2014such as the G-20 Mutual Assessment Process\u2014be \nfurther strengthened to ensure strong, sustainable, and balanced growth?  \n(v)  How should automatic stabilizers be built into the global economy?  \n(vi)  How can global economic governance and the international monetary system be \nreformed to help the global rebalancing process? \n \n6.  Since the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis, ASEAN+3 has made significant progress in \nregional  cooperation  by  focusing  on  establishing  a  regional  liquidity  support  mechanism, \ndeveloping regional bond markets, and reinforcing the economic review and policy dialogue \nprocess. Development of ASEAN+3 monetary and financial cooperation has contributed to \neconomic  and  financial  stability  and  regional  integration.  With  Asia\u2019s  growing  economic \ninfluence, the region should further increase economic integration and cooperation efforts. In the \nmeantime, the global financial crisis has called for global solutions and cooperation. The post-\ncrisis  landscape  highlights  the  need  for  formal  collaboration  mechanisms  between  Asian \neconomies and global institutions. To meet these challenges, collective regional and global \naction should be complementary and mutually reinforcing. Asia\u2019s collaboration should not be at \nthe cost of its openness with the rest of the world\u2014it must adhere to its long-standing strategy \nof \u201copen regionalism.\u201d \n \n7.  With particular focus on regional trade and financial cooperation, the TA will examine \nareas  such  as  reinforcement  of  regional  and  global  financial  safety  nets,  financial  market \ndevelopment, macroeconomic and financial surveillance, market efficiency and transparency, \nand free trade agreements. Specifically, the TA will address the following questions:  \n(i)  How can the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization develop a crisis prevention \nfunction and cooperate with the International Monetary Fund, given the relative \nstrengths and specialized roles of each?7  \n(ii)  How and where does the region further deepen financial cooperation? \n                                                \n7 The Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization is a multilateral currency swap contract that covers all ASEAN+3 \nmembers. Its core functions are to (i) address balance of payment and short-term liquidity difficulties in the region, \nand (ii) supplement existing international financial arrangements. Its current size is $120 billion. \n ", "  3\n(iii)  What is the role of global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund in \nregional surveillance?  \n(iv)  How can regional free trade agreements be further expanded and how do they \nrelate to existing global arrangements?  \n \n8.  In addition, general themes may need to be explored, such as how should regional and \nglobal financial and trade arrangements interact, and what are the main impediments to closer \ncooperation with global institutions. \n \n9.  Environmental damage and resource depletion from rapid growth are already impeding \nAsia\u2019s development, and anticipated increased affluence will place tremendous pressure on \nfinite natural resources. Moreover, with Asia home to more than half the world\u2019s population, \nclimate change has far-reaching implications. Asia needs to find regional and global solutions to \nsustain future development. Indeed, early and aggressive action is urgently needed\u2014simulation \nanalyses suggest Asian economies stand to suffer most from inaction (footnote 1). Asia\u2019s future \ncompetitiveness will depend heavily on how efficiently it uses natural resources and moves \ntoward a low-carbon future. Asia can better compete in a global economy where resource \nefficiency, clean energy, and low carbon are the ingredients of success and prosperity\u2014the \nfuture of economic growth is low-carbon growth. \n \n10.  The economy, natural resource utilization, and climate change are interdependent. Only \nconcerted action and an integrated policy vision can give Asia the lead as the 21st century \nmoves forward. Green growth has great potential to provide a clear and focused agenda for \naction and policies to pursue economic growth while preventing environmental degradation, \nbiodiversity loss, and unsustainable natural resource use. Asia must choose policies that are in \nits own best economic and environmental interest and which generate green returns to growth. \nHowever, the complexities and technicalities require a multidisciplinary approach, which will \nthen offer a range of policy options. Further scope for regional cooperation in areas such as \nclimate change financing; energy, food, and water security; efficiency; and conservation need to \nbe explored. In addition, reinforcing the existing regulatory environment to strengthen private \nsector participation in climate change and clean technology financing must be considered. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA will enhance the contribution of Asia\u2019s policy makers to global policy making by \nincreasing  regional  stakeholders\u2019  awareness  and  understanding  of  critical  economic  and \ndevelopment issues challenging the global economy, along with the impact of these issues on \nindividual Asian economies. The primary outcome of the TA is to enhance policy discussions on \ncritical issues challenging the economy at the global, regional, and national levels so as to \nsustain Asia\u2019s economic growth and development. It will promote coordinated policy responses \nby forging national commitments to regional and global international declarations, and foster \ngreater and more efficient policy dialogue and interaction, both globally and regionally. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The  TA  will  engage  a  prominent  international  research  institute  (steering  institute), \ntogether with ADB, to organize and supervise the high-level International Policy Advisory Group \n(IPAG).  The  \u201cvirtual\u201d  group\u2014supported  by  a  project  website\u2014will  consist  of  internationally \n ", "4  \nrenowned  economic  and  financial  experts,  chaired  by  a  leading  international  economist.8 \nMembers will be selected from within and outside Asia to ensure that views on issues covered \nare balanced and well represented.  \n \n13.  IPAG members will prepare background policy papers. Specific topics\u2015to be identified \njointly by ADB and the steering institute\u2015will fall under a uniform theme (e.g., one of the three \ncritical issues). The background papers will then provide the basis for the group report\u2014a \nconsolidated set of IPAG policy recommendations. The individual papers and the group report \nwill be compiled and published each year as an IPAG annual report. \n \n14.  There will be five IPAG meetings over the duration of the TA, organized jointly by ADB \nand the steering institute. To ensure Asia\u2019s stakeholder ownership in IPAG, meetings will also \nbe held within the region to gather comments from Asian stakeholders. The first meeting will \nstart IPAG activities and discuss its future work plan for subsequent meetings. Thereafter, IPAG \nwill meet twice a year in the following 2 years of the TA, for a total of four meetings. The draft \nbackground policy papers will be discussed during the first meeting each year. The second \nmeeting  will  finalize  these  papers  and  the  annual  report.  Other  prominent  economists, \nacademicians, policy makers, and stakeholders in the global economic arena will be invited to \noffer feedback and ensure that a well-balanced and finely tuned set of proposals are crafted, \nand that these effectively represent the views of Asia. To achieve maximum impact, the second \nmeeting should be held just prior to the annual G-20 summit. \n \n15.  The annual reports will be available through both electronic and printed media. These \nwill be disseminated extensively within and outside Asia through internal channels and public \nforums, to publicize IPAG\u2019s work to media and a wide range of stakeholders, and to solicit \nfeedback. The reports will also be available on the internet, primarily through the IPAG website, \nwhich  will  contain  information  on  the  group\u2019s  activities  and  publish  the  annual  reports, \nbackground papers, and other related downloadable materials. \n \n16.  With  numerous  ADB  studies  focusing  on  post-crisis  policy  challenges  for  Asia\u2019s \neconomies\u2014as well as policy briefs to foster dialogue and better policy making\u2014the TA will \ncollaborate closely with other ADB departments (including the Asian Development Bank Institute) \nto  incorporate  lessons  learned  from  earlier  studies  and  coordinate  with  ongoing  work.9 \nPartnerships with other research and/or regional institutions with special interests in any of the \nresearch focus areas of the TA will also be pursued.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,245,000 equivalent and will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund.10 The detailed cost breakdown and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \n \n                                                \n8 The website will expand the website associated with the Technical Assistance for the Future Global Reserve \nSystem\u2015An Asian Perspective (ADB. 2009.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. Capitalizing on the success of the Office of \nRegional Economic Integration\u2019s (OREI\u2019s) technical assistance for global reserve system reform, \nwhich aimed to enrich the current debate on the issue and empower Asia\u2019s policy makers and \nthe  public  to  participate  more  constructively  in  the  global  dialogue  on  the  global  financial \narchitecture, the TA will continue to engage the Earth Institute at Columbia University as the \nsteering institute.11 The Earth Institute is an internationally renowned research institute that \ndraws  on  Columbia  University\u2019s  scientific  rigor  and  academic  leadership  to  create  an \ninterdisciplinary  community  dedicated  to  cutting-edge  research.  Furthermore,  the  Earth \nInstitute\u2019s tasks under the proposed TA are a natural continuation of the steering activities of the \ninstitute in earlier TA, in which it was engaged to organize a group of high-level experts and to \nprovide specialized technical capacity and guidance to the final TA report. To maintain this \ncontinuity, and also due to the relatively small amount allocated for the steering institute\u2019s \nservices in this TA, the Earth Institute will be engaged through the single source selection \nprocedure. In accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time), experts and consultants engaged for the TA shall come from ADB member \ncountries. \n \n19.  The Earth Institute will be asked to submit a biodata technical proposal, which will form \nthe basis for negotiation of a contract with the institute. The team to be provided by the Earth \nInstitute will consist of (i) a lead economist and chair of IPAG, and (ii) a project coordinator. The \nEarth Institute will be responsible for arranging and paying all travel expenses and remuneration \nfor  this  team  within  a  total  engagement  period  of  5  person-months  for  the  international \nconsultant and 26 person-months for the national consultants, and other relevant costs. \n \n20.  OREI will be responsible for project implementation from September 2011 to March \n2014 and will involve the Earth Institute (with an estimated 31.0 person-months of consulting \nservices), 12 international consultants (with an estimated 34.7 person-months of consulting \nservices), and 4 national consultants (with 44.9 person-months of consulting services) to assist \nin TA implementation. Resource persons for workshops and seminars will also be engaged for \napproximately 2.3 person-months. OREI will establish a project administration team comprising \ntwo international staff and two local staff dedicated to administering consultant contracts and the \narrangement of resource persons. The team will be appointed on a permanent basis for the 31-\nmonth project period. \n  \n21.  The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Individual consultants \nwill  be  hired  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,245,000 on a grant basis \nfor Policies to Meet Global Economic Challenges\u2015Asia\u2019s Perspective, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2009.
