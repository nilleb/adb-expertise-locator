In July 2013, the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development (MPED) \nasked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to support the drafting \nof a new company law, the establishment of an electronic company registry, and other policy \nsupport relating to the investment climate. In response, ADB conducted a fact-finding mission in \nJuly 2013; during that mission ADB and MPED agreed on the proposed impact, outcome and \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference as \nlaid  out  in  the  approved  concept  paper.1 Previous  consultations  on  the  company  law  and \nregistry system were held in December 2012 and February 2013. The December 2012 mission \nincluded a presentation on a reform agenda to senior government officials based on ADB \nanalysis of the company law and registry carried out in 2012.2  The TA is included in the interim \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 for Myanmar.3  The project design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Myanmar\u2019s  economic  growth  performance  has  been  mixed.  Various  estimates  of \neconomic  growth  and  production  suggest  that  long-term  growth  has  been  relatively  low \ncompared  with  neighboring  economies.  Based  on  International  Monetary  Fund  estimates, \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP) averaged 4.6% during 2005\u20132010, increased to above \n5.0% during fiscal year (FY) 2011\u2013FY2012, with projected GDP growth of 6.2% in FY2013. The \naverage GDP growth rate is much lower than the rates achieved by Indonesia, Malaysia, and \nThailand in the 1970s and 1980s, during their early stages of industrialization. \n \n3.  Long-term economic growth in Myanmar has not been broad-based, as reflected in the \nstructure of the economy, with agriculture and low-end services accounting for 76% of GDP. \nEconomic growth has also not been inclusive, and there are significant disparities in economic \ngrowth in various regions, with economic activity concentrated in a few key commercial centers. \nAs a consequence, the incidence of poverty has declined only slowly. The most reliable survey \nof household wellbeing in Myanmar is the Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey, \nconducted in 2005 and 2009\u20132010.4  Based on the results of the survey, the union poverty \nincidence fell from 31% in 2005 to 25% in 2009\u20132010. However, other proxies for poverty show \nmixed results. The share of food in total consumption actually increased for the poorest 30% of \nthe population, and declined only for the richest 10%, suggesting that the wellbeing of the \npoorest families may not have improved.  \n \n4.  The  government  has  set  out  a  challenging  economic  reform  agenda  to  increase \neconomic  growth  to  sustainable  levels  and  ensure  it  is  inclusive,  and  reaches  different \nsocioeconomic groups and sub-regions. The agenda includes: (i) macroeconomic stabilization; \n(ii)  trade,  investment  and  financial  integration;  (iii)  stimulating  rural  development;  and  \n(iv) promoting human capital development.5 \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 October 2013. \n2  ADB. 2012.

Manila. ", "2 \n5.  Insufficient investor protection and a cumbersome and complex licensing and regulatory \nenvironment have suppressed investments in Myanmar and deterred new foreign investment. \nThe regulatory environment is complex, costly, and unpredictable. It can take up to 6 months for \nan investment license to be approved, as it requires cabinet approval, and another 2 months for \na company to register for the first time. The government has enacted a new foreign investment \nlaw, which has improved the regulatory conditions for foreign investment entry. However, the \nforeign investment law\u2019s effectiveness as a promotional tool to attract foreign investment is \nconstrained by an outdated company law. A company law provides the core legal framework for \nfirms to register and to operate as legal entities in a country. In Myanmar, the company law was \nenacted 99 years ago and is outdated for a modern market economy. For example, the current \ncompany law classifies a company according to the citizenship of its owners, a distinction that \ndoes not exist in company laws in the region\u2019s market economies. The company registry is an \noutdated manual system (footnote 2).  Companies must first register in Nay Pyi Taw, which \nadds  to  the  cost  of  registration.  The  results  of  this  system  are  telling.  According  to  the \nDirectorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA), only about 30,000 enterprises \non its registry are believed to be active. By comparison, there are about 500,000 active firms \nregistered under Thailand\u2019s company law; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (which has 10% of \nMyanmar\u2019s population) has about 94,000 firms registered under its enterprise law.  \n \n6.  The government is committed to  creating a competitive investment environment for \nprivate sector development. An improved investment environment would increase and support \nmore  inclusive  economic  growth  through  increased  enterprise  startups  and  subsequent \nemployment generation. The government recognizes the need for a new company law that \nwould  modernize  the  legal  framework  for  companies  to  operate  in  Myanmar,  including \npartnerships and other corporate arrangements. A new company law would also provide the \nopportunity to legislate much-needed corporate governance that is aligned to practices in other \ncommon law jurisdictions in the region, and would enable passage of other economic legislation \nsuch as a securities law and a competition law. A modern company law will serve as the \nfoundation for building a competitive private and corporate sector in Myanmar. An electronic \ncompany  registry  would  also  promote  better  governance  by  reducing  discretion  in  the \nregistration process.  \n \n7.  A new law has significant potential benefits for Myanmar. First, a new law and registry \nsystem would simplify and reduce the cost of incorporating a business in Myanmar, and thereby \nsupport  private  sector  investment.  Second,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises\u2014and \nespecially  those  owned  by  women\u2014will  benefit  from  a  more  transparent  and  lower-cost \nregistration system; these groups are generally more reluctant to register under the current \nhigh-cost manual system in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw. A new law will provide the opportunity for \nthe tens of thousands of small enterprises to formalize, and thus gain better access to finance \nand public services.  \n \n8.  The  interim  country  partnership  strategy  supports  the  government\u2019s  objectives  for \nimproving the investment climate. Reforms to the company registry and registration system are \nalso a policy measure specified in the post-program partnership framework (P3F) of the policy-\nbased loan (PBL) (footnote 5). The P3F sets out the government\u2019s reform agenda for 2012\u2013\n2014, and the proposed TA is designed to support implementation of the P3F. ADB worked with \nDICA staff under small-scale TA to review the 1914 Company Law and the company registry \n(footnote 2). An ADB-funded business regulation cost survey is currently being carried out in \nYangon to estimate the direct and time-based costs faced by businesses in complying with key \nlicensing requirements, which will provide the basis for monitoring the outcome of the proposed \nTA, and allow for an evidence-based impact evaluation of the TA outcome.  ", "3 \n \n9.  The  government  has  demonstrated  its  support  for  this  reform  and  announced  its \nintention to draft a new company law and establish an electronic registry. It has decided to \nundertake a comprehensive, sequenced reform of the company law and registration system, \nrather than adopting a short-term, piecemeal approach to reform, with associated higher risk of \npolicy  failure.  Through  the  proposed  TA,  the  government  is  committed  to  following  best \ninternational practice in the new company law and registry, based on examining examples from \nAsia and the Pacific. An important element of the proposed TA will be to link DICA with other \ncompany  registry  offices  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  for  knowledge  sharing  and  longer-term \npartnership and support. The MPED will establish a government committee, chaired by DICA, to \noversee the reform and drafting of the new company law. \n \n10.  The sequencing of this TA in support of this reform is important. The company law would \nbe enacted before the electronic company registry is developed and put into use, because the \nlaw will establish the type of company registry and the registration processes, and thus guide \nthe design and development of the registry. It is expected to take up to 8 months to draft and \nenact the law, with promulgation by the President of Myanmar anticipated around October 2014. \n \n11.  ADB  has  extensive  experience  working  with  developing  member  countries  on \nformulating new company laws and implementing company registrations. In Southeast Asia, \nADB  assisted  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  to  draft  its  enterprise  law,  supported  the \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to draft its enterprise law and develop a \nmodern  enterprise  registry,  and  supported  the  Government  of  Cambodia  to  establish  its \nenterprise registry.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n12.  The proposed TA aims to support a better investment climate, and is anchored on the \nP3F of the PBL. It has two main interventions: (i) assist the government to draft a modern \ncompany  law;  and  (ii)  develop  an  electronic  company  registry  to  allow  options  for  online \nregistration.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the proposed TA will be an increased number of enterprises registered \nunder the new company law. This will be achieved by establishing a legal foundation to enable \ndomestic and foreign firms to be treated equally when operating in Myanmar. Progress in \nachieving this impact will be measured by an increase, by 2020, of 40% in the number of firms \nregistered under the new registration system over the base year (FY2010 = 25,108).  \n \n14.  The outcome will be a strengthened legal and institutional framework for the investment \nsector. Progress towards achieving this outcome will be measured by a reduction by the end of \n2017 of 30% in the cost of starting a business, compared to the base year (2013). The impact \nand outcome performance indicators are specified in the design and monitoring framework of \nthe PBL. Adopting these indicators integrates the TA impact and outcome with the PBL and its \nP3F. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The key activities are divided into three main outputs. \n ", "4 \n16.  Output 1: Company law modernized. A team of consultants will draft a new company \nlaw and support DICA in holding public consultations, advocacy, and public education on the \nlaw and its implementation. Four international experts (for a total of 17 person-months) and two \nnational experts (for a total of 8 person-months) will be engaged to implement activities under \noutput 1. The international experts include (i) a team leader and corporate law expert (5 person-\nmonths) to oversee the activity; (ii) a corporate law advocacy expert (3 person-months) to work \nwith the team leader and DICA staff in developing the draft law and assisting with public \neducation and advocacy on the draft law; (iii) a legal draftsperson (3 person-months); and (iv) \ncompany registry expert (for 6 person-months) to provide input to the draft law on provisions \nrelated to the electronic registry, and to draft the specifications of the electronic registry, which \nwould  be  part  of  the  procurement  document  under  output  2.  The  expert  would  also  be \nresponsible for monitoring and evaluating progress in implementing the registry under output 2. \nThe  two  national  experts  are  (i)  a communications  and  media  relations  expert  (4  person-\nmonths) and (ii) a national legal expert (4 person-months).  \n \n17.  Output 2: Electronic company registry established. A firm specializing in the design, \ndevelopment,  and  implementation  of  a  company  registry  would  be  engaged  to  implement \nactivities  under  this  output  using  performance  terms  of  reference  and  related  selection \nprocedures.  Activities  under  this  output  include  (i)  procurement  of  an  electronic  company \nregistry  to  allow  owners  of  enterprises  to  register  online  in  accordance  with  agreed \nspecifications of the electronic registry developed under output 1; (ii) DICA staff training to \nmanage the electronic registry; (iii) support DICA promotion of the new electronic registry, and \nassist DICA with re-registration of enterprises; and (iv) technical support of the registry until \nJune 2017 (see para. 19).   \n \n18.  Output 3: Staff skills and knowledge. Shifting from the current system of regulatory \ncontrol and a manual registry to a modern company law with an electronic registry will result in \nchanges in some DICA staff tasks and assignments. It will also require a shift in the outlook of \nthe staff, away from regulatory control to private sector facilitation. New skills will be required. \nThis output would support a DICA training needs assessment, staff re-training, and longer-term \ncapacity development of DICA through exchange programs. Through ADB, output 3 would \nfacilitate partnerships between DICA and reputable company registry offices in Asia and the \nPacific, academia, and other agencies for sharing knowledge on new developments in company \nlaw and registries and other investment climate issues. A follow-up business regulation cost \nsurvey will be carried out in late 2016, and will provide input for an evaluation by ADB of the \nimpact of the new electronic company registry.  \n \n19.  The following timeline is expected to be followed in implementing activities under outputs \n1 to 3: (i) draft and translate the company bill (4 months); (ii) provide public education and carry \nout stakeholder consultations on the draft law\u2014DICA and project team, simultaneous with (i);  \n(iii) submit the company bill to the Office of the Attorney General for review and revision of legal \nlanguage (1\u20132 months or more); (iv) submit to the President\u2019s office and the cabinet (up to 1 \nmonth);  (v)  submit  to  the  National  Assembly  (around  November  2014);  and  (vi)  following \nenactment, promulgation of the law by the President (1\u20132 months). Thus, it is expected that the \ncompany law will be promulgated in early 2015, and the necessary implementing decrees \n(which will be drafted with the bill) then issued. The priority implementing regulations would be \nissued in the first quarter of 2015. The initiation of the ADB  procurement process for the \nelectronic registry under output 2 would begin once the law has been submitted to the National \nAssembly, which is expected in November 2014. Actual procurement of the registry (i.e., signing \nof a contract under output 2) would occur once the company law has been enacted. The registry \nis  expected  to  be  trialed  in  mid-2015  and  fully  operational  by  October  2015,  with ", "5 \ncommencement of the re-registration system. DICA capacity building and technical servicing of \nthe electronic registry would continue until June 2017. DICA (through the electronic registry) \nwould collect annual registration fees to ensure its financial sustainability after the TA finishes in \nJune 2017.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $ 1,521,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and \nother in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The  executing  agency  will  be  DICA,  which  is  an  agency  of  the  MPED.  DICA  is \nresponsible for the implementation of the company law and company registry. The MPED will \nestablish a task force for overseeing the drafting of the company law and implementation of the \nelectronic  company  registry.  The  task  force  will  be  chaired  by  DICA  and  will  comprise \nrepresentatives from MPED, the Office of Attorney General, and the private sector. DICA will \nprovide office space with furniture and support services for the consultants.  \n \n22.  A team of four international consultants and two national consultants will be recruited by \nADB through individual contract services to implement activities under output 1 (para. 16). A \nfirm will be engaged using performance terms of reference to develop, operationalize, and \nprovide technical support for the electronic company registry. The firm will also provide training \nto DICA staff to manage and promote the registry. The firm will be selected using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method with a 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio. The selection and recruitment \nof consultants will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nEquipment  and  the  registry  procured  under  this  TA  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and the assets will be handed \nover to the executing agency upon completion of the project. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 38 months (starting in May 2014, and ending by June \n2017), following the signing of the TA agreement between the government and ADB. Consultant \ndeliverables are included in the terms of reference in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Myanmar to be financed on a grant basis  by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Strengthening Institutions for a Better Investment Climate, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.
