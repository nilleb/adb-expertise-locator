INTRODUCTION \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will support an \nincrease in regional power trade among Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, \nUzbekistan, and Turkmenistan by (i) modernizing the Coordinating Dispatch Center (CDC) \nEnergiya, which coordinates power flow between the national electricity grids of the Central Asian \npower system (CAPS), to enhance its technical capacity; (ii) identifying the technical obstacles to \npower trade for CAPS, and proposing and coordinating solutions to overcome them for each \ncountry; and (iii) supporting the expansion of CAPS membership and seeking new markets. \n \n2.  In March 2018, countries at the Energy Sector Coordinating Committee meeting under the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program agreed to request TA from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to bridge the gap between energy supply and demand by \nfacilitating cross-border trading. The TA is fully aligned with the CAREC 2030 strategy for \n(i) promoting energy trade and further integrating energy markets in the CAREC region and \n(ii) connecting Afghanistan with CAPS. The TA also directly supports the CAREC Energy Work \nPlan, 2016\u20132020, especially element 2 on promoting regional electricity trade and harmonization. \nHowever, it is not included in any of ADB\u2019s country operations business plans.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Diminished power trade in the region. Power trade among Central Asian countries has \nbeen declining since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1990, 25,413 million kilowatt-\nhours (kWh) were traded among Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan.  By  2010,  the  energy trade  had  decreased  to  2,256 million kWh following the \ndisconnection of Tajikistan from CAPS in 2009; it bottomed out in 2016 at 2,080 million kWh.2 The \ndrop in energy trade has caused widespread power outages in Tajikistan in winters and increased \nfossil fuel use by Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in summers. While hydropower \nexports from the Kyrgyz Republic have continued, the lack of hydropower from Tajikistan in \nsummer has forced fossil fuel-rich countries to generate electricity using gas and oil instead of \nexporting  those  fuels.  Meanwhile,  Tajikistan  has  had  to  make  substantial  investments  in \ngenerating capacity to produce electricity in winter, while being unable to export hydropower in \nsummer. Tajikistan spills large amount of water annually which could have been used to generate \nabout 5 billion\u20137 billion kWh of energy. Because of the limited electricity trading opportunities \nwithin CAPS, the Kyrgyz Republic had to find additional trading partners such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and Pakistan. \n \n4.  Technical constraints on capacity to trade power. During the time of the Soviet Union, \nthe Central Asian energy flow between the electricity grids of southern Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan  was  regulated  by  the  United  Dispatch \nAdministration of Central Asia (based in Tashkent, Uzbekistan), subordinated to the central \ndispatch and planning institution in Moscow. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, United \nDispatch Administration became nongovernment organization in 1993 and was renamed to CDC. \nThe governance was assigned to the Central Asia United Power System Council (CAUPS), \ncomprising the heads of the national power systems. The council was responsible for the \nadministration  and  coordination  of  the  parallel  operations3 of  CAPS.  In  2004,  Kazakhstan, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 November 2018. \n2  The actual trade among CAPS members was 579 million kWh. The balance includes bilateral trade with Afghanistan. \n3  Parallel operation of electrical grids refers to a synchronous grid or an \u2018interconnection\u2019, which is a group of areas \noperating with three phase alternating current frequencies synchronized (so that peaks occur at virtually the same \n ", "2 \nTajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan concluded an intergovernmental agreement on \nthe coordination of electricity grids of Central Asia. CDC was given the status of international \norganization working under the guidance of the CAUPS. Turkmenistan withdrew from CAPS in \n2003 and switched to parallel operations with Iran. The signatories provide the financing for CDC. \n \n5.  Unlike the national dispatch centers in the Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic,4 and Tajikistan,5 \nno significant technological modernizations were made at CDC since it was established in the \n1960s and converted to a non-governmental organization.6 CDC relies on outdated technologies \nto perform its functions, including (i) coordination of the operations of power systems and energy \nentities within CAPS, (ii) determination of the conditions for the parallel operation of CAPS, \n(iii) coordination of operation personnel\u2019s actions during intersystem emergencies and elimination \nof intersystem accidents, (iv) coordination of relay protection and automation of circuits and \nsettings, (v) coordination of operation of dispatch data acquisition and transmission systems, and \n(vi) control over measurements and metering of international power flows within CAPS. \n \n6.  CDC\u2019s  technological  limitations,  which  constrain  regional  power  trade,  include  the \nfollowing: (i) power flows within CAPS are forecast 6 months in advance using historical data and \ncannot be adjusted using real-time figures; accordingly, power flow planning is not optimized \nbecause of unnecessarily high safety factors; (ii) in the event of an accident on the grid, the site \nof the fault can take a day or longer to locate; (iii) the settlement of power flows between countries \nis unnecessarily long as the actual metered flows and reported flows do not match up because of \nthe quality of CDC\u2019s telemetry;7 and (iv) newly constructed assets cannot be monitored without \ntaking out something else; thus, CDC does not have a full picture of all important sites at once. \n \n7.  Central Asian power system membership expansion. Afghanistan already trades \nbilaterally with, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In 2017 Afghanistan expressed interest \nto join CAPS. Substantial assessments of Afghanistan\u2019s electricity grid will be needed to ensure \nits compatibility with CAPS as well as amendment of the CAPS intergovernmental agreement. \n \n8.  Tajikistan reconnection into Central Asian power system. After almost a decade of \ndisconnection, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan agreed to reconnect their power systems. Tajikistan is \nworking with CDC and Uzbekistan\u2019s utility company to address technical constraints to the CAPS \nreconnection. Tajikistan started to export power to Uzbekistan on islanded mode (nonparallel \noperation) through two 220-kV lines and one 500-kV line in the second quarter of 2018. As \nTajikistan\u2019s electricity grid has been modernized, some assessments and works will be required \nto adjust relay protection systems and ensure synchronous (parallel) operation with CAPS by the \nend of 2018.8 Uzbekistan\u2019s electricity grid will also require potential adjustments. \n \n                                                \ntime). This allows transmission of alternating current throughout the area, connecting large number of electricity \ngenerators and consumers and potentially enabling more efficient electricity markets.    \n4  ADB. 2010.

JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n9.  The cluster will include three subprojects that will aim to support the increase in power \ntrade within CAPS by (i) introducing an energy data management (EDM) system to CDC to enable \na safe increase of energy flow within CAPS; (ii) identifying and offering solutions to any technical \nbottlenecks  to  regional  power  trade  that  may  occur  in  any  of  the  CAPS  countries;  and \n(iii) facilitating power trade within CAPS, expanding CAPS membership, and exploring additional \npotential energy markets to increase potential for power trade. \n \n10.  The TA cluster modality is appropriate as each subproject has individually identifiable \noutputs that contribute to a single outcome. Since the subprojects are strategically linked with the \ncommon overall objective, the TA cluster modality will allow them to be flexibly designed and \nimplemented, leading to better sequencing of TA activities than with a stand-alone TA. The cluster \nTA modality also allows ADB to sequentially commit funds based on the actual progress. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \nA.  Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n11.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impacts: countries\u2019 emission reduction target \nachieved,  CAREC  regional  cooperation  framework  accomplished,9 and  energy  security  in \nselected CAREC countries enhanced. The TA cluster will have the following outcome: cross-\nborder clean energy trade increased using high-level technology (HLT) by CDC. The HLT will \nreplace manual processes to allow CDC to operate in a real-time regime.10 \n \n12.  Output 1: CDC Energiya modernized, capacitated and engendered. This output will \nbe delivered by analyzing the installed SCADA energy management systems in Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan; and by introducing an EDM system for CDC. The EDM system \nwill be procured and integrated into CDC. Measures to incentivize women to join CDC workforce \nwill be explored. \n \n13.  The EDM system, which is an HLT, will be deployed to replace all Soviet-era equipment \nand processes at CDC. The aim will be to maximize the utilization of the CAPS transmission \ncapacity by enabling operation of the regional grid in real time. Introduction of modern systems \nwith  greatly  increased  volumes  of  telemetry  information  collected  by  CDC  will  also  allow \ncentralization of CAPS emergency automation.11 \n \n14.  Output 2: Solutions to the bottlenecks to the regional power trade provided. This \noutput will be delivered through an examination of the national grids of all CAPS countries to \nidentify  and  propose  technical  solutions  to  the  bottlenecks  within  each  one  that  constrain \nelectricity flow. The Central Asian Electricity Grid Coordination Board will endorse the final \nfindings for implementation by Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n \n15.  Output 3: Membership in CAPS expanded. This output will be delivered through studies \nand dialogue to facilitate the admission of new members into CAPS.

Afghanistan\u2019s electricity \ngrid will be assessed for its compatibility with other national grids. The consultant will propose the \nnecessary works on Afghanistan\u2019s electricity grid and other national grids to ensure safe parallel \noperation  for  consideration  by  the  Central  Asian  Electricity  Grid  Coordination  Board  and \nimplementation by Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.  The consultant \nwill also explore connection options for Turkmenistan, who also trades electricity with Afghanistan, \nto connect to CAPS. The consultant will also study the alternate energy markets. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $4.5 million, of which (i) $1,500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6); (ii) $1 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund;12 (iii) $1 million will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund13 under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB; and (iv) $1 million will be financed on a grant basis \nby the High-Level Technology Fund14 and administered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates and \n \nfinancing arrangements will be presented in each TA subproject proposal submitted for approval. \n \n17.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space and \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. The Energy Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia \nDepartment will be the executing agency for all subprojects in close coordination with ADB \nresident missions.15 Each TA subproject proposal will be submitted for approval to the Director \nGeneral, Central and West Asia Department, in accordance with the business process for \nknowledge and support TA cluster processing after consultations with ADB\u2019s Office of Cofinancing \nOperations.

The \nconsultant firm will then train the CDC staff in operation of the newly installed \nequipment. \nThe technical assistance (TA) will also finance the institutional capacity \nbuilding of the Central Asian power system (CAPS) by organizing a regional \nworkshop to be held in one of the CAPS countries with participants from \nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and CDC. The \nworkshop  will  present  experiences  of  other  countries  with  advanced \ntransmission  systems  and  share  their  experience  in  system  planning, \nelectricity dispatch between regions, and policy setting. Japan\u2019s experience \nin dealing with abrupt power changes caused by natural calamities is of \ninterest and importance as many of the CAPS countries also experience \npower intermittency. At least four persons from Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as CDC, will be invited with at \nleast half being women. The composition of each delegation should contain \none person in charge of technical policy making and one from strategic \nplanning. \nAn international consultant will be engaged to conduct surveys and explore \nopportunities to engage more women students in universities by creating \nincentive mechanisms and an enabling environment for women employment. \nInternational and national consultants as well as resource persons will be \nrecruited individually to provide technical and logistical support to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the implementing agencies. \nIndicative  ADB will be the executing agency. CDC Energiya will be the implementing \nimplementation  agency. \narrangements \nSubproject 1 is proposed to be financed with $500,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6);  $1,000,000  from  the  High-Level \n ", "Appendix 2  9 \nTechnology Fund, and $1,000,000 from the Asian Clean Energy Fund under \nthe Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The Asian Clean Energy \nFunda will be used to design the energy data management system and \nfinance capacity building in the form of knowledge exchange during the study \ntours; ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6) and the High-\nLevel Technology Fund will be used to finance the physical upgrade of CDC. \nImplementation  November 2018\u2013December 2020 \nschedule \nSubproject 2  Provision of Solutions to Bottlenecks to Regional Power Trade \nIndicative  Output: At least three technical solutions to electricity grids provided to \noutputs and  countries for implementation. \nactivities \nA  consultant  firm  will  be  recruited  to  assess  the  electricity  grids  of \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan in order to determine the \ntechnical bottlenecks to energy trade and recommend technical solutions.b \nExamples  include  substations  in  any  of  the  CAPs  countries  and/or \ntransmission lines between two countries that are dilapidated or insufficient \ncapacity, which limits the amount of electricity that can be traded. Another \nexample is the dismantled 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission line between Regar \nsubstation (Tajikistan) and Gusar substation (Uzbekistan), which prevents \nparallel operation of the Tajikistan and Uzbekistan electricity networks. The \ntwo countries are working on a technical solution to achieve parallel operation \nby instead connecting an existing Sughd substation (Tajikistan) to the 500 kV \nSerdarya\u2013Uzbekiston transmission line in the north of Tajikistan. However, \nthe missing 500 kV in the south of Tajikistan still limits the amount of electricity \nthat can be passed to Uzbekistan in the south of Tajikistan because of the \ninsufficient transmission capacity. \nThe study will update the Power Sector Regional Master Plan of the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program to take into account \nrecently completed infrastructure projects. \nThe study will also explore alternate energy markets outside of CAPS to \nincrease the import and export of energy. Connecting to other energy markets \nwill require identifying bottlenecks and proposing technical solutions. For \nexample, for Turkmenistan to connect to CAPS in the parallel mode (500 kV) \nwhile continuing to trade with Iran (400 kV), a back-to-back substation in Iran \n(Serax substation) that is connected to Turkmenistan (Mary substation) could \nbe considered. This would also enable the connection of CAPS, through Iran, \nto Turkey and the Caucasus. These types of solutions will be explored for \nRussian Federation\u2013Kazakhstan\u2013Central Asia\u2013South Asia energy trade or \nconnection to the People\u2019s Republic of China as part of One Belt, One Road \nInitiative. \nThese solutions will need to be developed in close coordination with each of \nthe national grids and CDC Energiya, and they may require the endorsement \nof  the  Central  Asia  United  Power  System  Council  (CAUPSC)  for \nimplementation by each country. \nHigh- and working-level meetings will be organized through the duration of \nthe regional technical assistance to facilitate (i) decision-making within the \nCAREC framework and (ii) discussion with prospective countries for trade \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \noutside of CAPS. International and national consultants, as well as resource \npersons,  will  be  recruited  individually  to  provide  technical  and  logistical \nsupport to ADB and the implementing agencies. \nIndicative  ADB will be the executing agency.

Proposals for amendment of the intergovernmental agreements \nand the charter of CDC Energiya will be also developed for consideration by \nthe CAPS countries. The CAUPSC, which will make the final decision, will be \nconsulted throughout the process. International and national consultants, as \nwell as resource persons, will be engaged individually, as necessary, to \nprovide  technical  and  logistical  support  during  the  consideration  and \ndeliberation of the CAUPSC. \nIndicative  ADB will be the executing agency.
