THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hebei Elderly Care Development Project.1 The \nreport  also  describes  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Establishment  of  an \nIntegrated Comprehensive Three-Tier System for Elderly Care, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the development of an integrated three-tier elderly care \nsystem (ECS) in Hebei Province through improving the quality and coverage of home, community, \nand residential elderly care services (ECSS) and facilities. It will be the first project for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comprehensively addressing ECS and services development by public \nand private sector. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale   \n3.  The most significant demographic challenge facing the PRC is the aging of the population, \nand the social and economic impacts that will occur because of the rapid pace and scale of the \ndemographic change. The proportion of people above the age of 60 across the PRC is expected \nto grow from about 12% in 2010 to 34% by 2050. Traditional family support systems are \nincreasingly  unable  to  meet  elderly  care  needs  because  of  the  combined  impacts  of  fast \nurbanization, internal migration of youth away from rural areas, and the one-child policy. The \npopulation is aging rapidly while the country\u2019s per capita income is still modest and social security \nsystems are insufficient to meet the needs of senior citizens. The growing demand for quality and \naffordable ECSS and development of care models for urban and rural areas exceeds supply. \nThese are urgent development issues that must be addressed.2 \n \n4.  Hebei entered \u201caging society\u201d status in 1999 when it passed the 10% threshold of \npopulation over the age of 60. This is projected to be 17% in 2016, rising to 31% by 2050. The \nprovince has great diversity in the distribution of elderly, their care needs, income levels, and \navailability of services. Some rural counties have a high density of elderly who are \u201cleft behind\u201d \nafter their children have moved to urban areas. Few elderly remain in other counties, making it \ndifficult to provide decentralized services. Urban areas are aging at different rates, resulting in a \nvariety of demand for services. The government has identified Hebei as a demonstration province \nfor elderly care development because of its experience in developing a rural care model, and \nsince it is representative of the challenges other provinces face with limited government funds \navailable for elderly care and growing elderly populations.3 A strong desire exists in the province\u2014\nand nationally\u2014to identify models and implementation partnerships that can deliver quality and \naffordable ECSS. To achieve this, it is necessary to identify and define the optimum roles for \ngovernment, private sector, civil society stakeholders, and the public in elderly care. \n \n5.  The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 supported creating a three-tiered old age \ncare system with home-based care as the base, community care as a support, and residential \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018. \nManila. \n3  In 2008, a model of mutual support communal homes for the rural elderly called \u201cXingfu Yards\u201d (translated as \n\u201cHappiness Yards\u201d) was developed, which the Ministry of Civil Affairs has rolled out nationally since 2011. ", "2 \ncare as supplement.4 This is in line with international trends to support \u201caging in place\u201d (supporting \nelderly to live in their communities), de-institutionalization, and active aging. The PRC\u2019s Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 seeks to expand coverage, and enhance the quality of services by \ndeveloping the private sector and civil society organizations capacity to play a greater role in \nelderly care.5 The government is seeking models for elderly care that address key challenges: \nfinancing gaps, developing the market, and improving the unbalanced rural\u2013urban development. \nIn the next 5 years, significant changes are expected to take place: (i) subsidies to the sector will \nincrease and be better targeted, and new programs such as long-term care insurance may play \na greater role in promoting access; and (ii) the next generation of elderly (particularly urban) will \nbe better-off and more able to afford care. Stimulating the role of the private sector and civil society \nis critical for expanding coverage and improving the quality of services. ADB\u2019s recently approved \nproject  in  Yichang  Municipality,  Hubei  will  develop  one  approach\u2014a  model  public\u2013private \npartnerships for ECSS in urban districts.6 A range of other models that can successfully operate \nin less-developed areas, build new partnerships for service delivery, and address the multiple \ncare needs of aging populations, also needs to be developed. \n \n6.  Translating national policies into programs in Hebei is challenging. For residential nursing \ncare, only 50% of the projected total need for beds (250,000) in the province is available, and \npublic perceptions and the quality of elderly care facilities are low. Human resources, incentives, \nand policies to retain and train staff, are insufficient. Planning for the expansion of ECSS is not \nsystematic, and home and community care services are largely underdeveloped. Critical service \nareas such as dementia care and rehabilitation are very limited, and government financing of \nelderly care is insufficient. To help address the lack of services, local governments are seeking \nways  to  incentivize  new  care  models  and  private  and  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs) \ninvolvement, neither of which are yet significant. Poor public perceptions of the quality of services, \naffordability, and traditional cultural attitudes are key constraints to the uptake and sustainability \nof services. \n \n7.  To address these problems, the project will develop five anchor elderly care residential \nfacilities (run by the public and private sectors) targeting elderly with long-term care needs.7 These \nwill serve as care hubs, and develop and operate home- and community-based care (HCBC) \nservices and information and communication technology (ICT) networks to serve a broad range \nof elderly. This will support the concept of \u201caging in place\u201d, a lifestyle that consultations with elderly \nfound that most prefer, and affordable care options. Additional facilities and services, such as \nrehabilitation centers, will be constructed to help relieve pressure on hospital beds to improve \nhealth and elderly care sector integration\u2014an emerging government policy focus. Capacity \nbuilding for implementing agencies, local civil affairs bureaus (CABs), and implementation of pilot \nprojects to address critical aspects of ECS development are integral to the project design. \nYanshan University will develop an elderly care training center and short- and long-term new \ncourses in five priority areas: (i) caregiving and nursing, (ii) occupational therapy, (iii) elderly care \nmanagement, (iv) geriatric psychology, and (v) ICT for elderly care. Together, the subprojects \n                                                \n4  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2011.

The plan includes (i) giving access to 80% of all urban and rural residents for home- and \ncommunity-based care (HCBC), and (ii) significantly increasing residential elderly care beds to keep pace with \ndemand as the elderly population expands. \n6  ADB. 2016.

Strategic fit. The project supports the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 \n(footnote 5) and the Hebei Provincial Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, which seek to \ndevelop the ECS, stimulate investment, and define roles and responsibilities for the government \nand the private and CSOs. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013\n2020 pillar on inclusive growth; the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which supports social \nprotection and health; and the Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, which has elderly care as \na focus area.8 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact,  which  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  goal,  will  be  an  established \ncomprehensive  three-tiered  ECS  (home,  community,  and  residential). The  outcome  will  be \nimproved capacity of the ECS and quality of ECSS in Hebei. \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project will have four outputs. Output 1, improved community and home care services, \nwill develop (i) selected community centers, (ii) services and support networks to improve and \nexpand  service  delivery  and  quality,  (iii)  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies  to  create \nsustainable HCBC services that meet the needs of the elderly, and (iv) ICT networks that support \nthe elderly and service delivery. Output 2, increased residential elderly care service capacity and \nimproved quality, will (i) provide residential care services for elderly with various types of need \n(i.e., nursing care, dementia care, rehabilitation); (ii) establish links to existing health care facilities \nand home and community care to support a continuum of care; and (iii) serve as demonstration \nmodels of government and private sector collaboration for other small cities seeking to improve \nelderly care quality and service delivery. Output 3, improved development of human resources \nand industry capacity, will help address the human resources shortages and quality by supporting \nYanshan University to develop (i) training programs and faculty capacity in emerging service areas, \nsuch as caregiving and nursing, rehabilitation, elderly care management, technology to support \nelderly care, and counseling; (ii) curriculum and training materials in the priority areas with \nselected academic and training institutions across the province; and (iii) an elderly care training \nand research center, and student dormitory on the Yanshan University campus. Output 4, \nimproved capacity of elderly care sector organizations, will build the capacity of stakeholders and \nlocal CABs in planning, elderly care management, assessment, and quality assurance and \nmonitoring. It will also implement innovative pilot projects in priority areas, such as health and \nelderly care integration, new services development (rehabilitation and dementia care), HCBC \nservices, and ICT. Training and advisory support  will be provided to facilitate the efficient \nimplementation and operationalization of the ECSS.  \n \n11.  Innovative features. The project will have demonstration value for other PRC provinces \nand developing countries in Asia and the Pacific facing similar challenges of aging populations.9 \nInnovative features include the development of (i) an integrated elderly care service model that \nlinks home, community, and residential care and management; (ii) pilot projects to support good \npractice ECS development in  areas such as management, quality assurance, and new services \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2016.

Commitment \ncharges for the OCR loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.  The government has requested a regular loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and \nother charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government has requested that \nrepayment follow the straight-line commitment-linked repayment method. Based on this straight-\nline method, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. \nThe  loan  will  also  finance  taxes  and  duties  on  items  financed  by  ADB.  The  local  county \ngovernments and the project owners will finance the remaining $80.11 million of project cost. The \ngovernment has also requested the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $670,000 to the Government of the PRC for Establishment of an Integrated Comprehensive \nThree-tier System for Elderly Care.    \n \n14.

The project includes funding for international and national consulting services to support \nHebei Project Management Office (HPMO) and the implementing agencies to implement the \nproject and carry out capacity-building activities. The project design also includes limited start-up \nconsulting  to  assist  with  project-readiness  activities.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices are in the PAM. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.  The capacity development TA to be financed by ADB is included to provide support to \nlocal government county civil affairs bureaus (CABs) to help build their sector management \ncapacity and address key issues, including (i) sector planning and regulation, (ii) social inclusion \nand assessment of care needs, and (iii) use of the CSOs as resource to expand the scope and \nprovision of elderly care services. The TA is estimated to cost $695,150, of which $670,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nIt has six outputs: (i) a model demand-based elderly care sector plan and supporting planning \nmanual; (ii) a demonstration elderly care assessment system, including user tool kits, computer \nsoftware, and implementation guidance; (iii) model procedures for the effective regulation of \nelderly  care  service  providers;  (iv)  the  creation  of  a  model  arrangement  for  the  effective \ninvolvement of the CSOs in elderly care provision; (v) a pilot online support for family caregivers; \nand (vi) effective TA dissemination. HPG will be the executing agency and HPMO will be the \nimplementing agency over the five-year implementation period. HPG will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical \n19.  The project will finance construction of (i) five elderly care institutions, (ii) 51 community \ncenters  and/or  offices,  (iii)  a  center  of  excellence  for  human  resource  development;  and \n(iv) procurement and installation of associated equipment. Technical feasibility was found to be \nadequate after careful examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and future \ndemand  projections  for  elderly  care  service.  All  buildings,  with  a  total  area  of  about \n172,000 square meters (m2), will be designed and constructed in accordance with relevant design \nstandards and codes. International and domestic best practices were studied to optimize the \nfunctional, aesthetic, engineering, environmental, and economic aspects of the facilities. The \narchitectural design will follow community-based, care-focused, efficient, inclusive, and non-\ninstitutional principles established during project preparation. The design incorporates infection \ncontrol, fire control, accident prevention, and emergency evacuation to ensure user safety. Low-\n ", "7 \ncarbon, resource-efficient measures, including solar and photovoltaic panels, water recycling, and \npassive energy-saving designs will be adopted. All five elderly care institutions will be designed \nto meet the two-star national green building standard.11 About 88% of the community centers will \nbe housed in rehabilitated existing buildings. \nB.  Economic and Financial   \n20.  Economic analysis. Economic benefits will include (i) an increase in the years of life \ngained and enhanced quality of life for the elderly through improving care services, better \nintegration of elderly care and medical services, and support for \u201caging in place; (ii) labor released \nfrom informal care, such as the return of the adult children who have been caregivers to the  labor \nmarket; (iii) medical cost savings, since formal elderly care is professional and performs better in \nacute  and  chronic  disease  prevention,  reducing  morbidity  and  hospital  admissions;  (iv) fall \nprevention;  (v)  time  savings  for  informal  caregivers,  increased  number  of  employment \nopportunities, and earnings; (vi) benefits generated by ICT, such as administration cost savings \nand a higher possibility of independent living; and (vii) increased number of trained caregivers \nand medical personnel certified by the new university programs, measured by the wage premium. \nHowever, these benefits are difficult to quantify, so only three benefit streams were applied for \nthe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation: (i) years of life gained from residential \ncare; (ii) other benefits (revenues at elderly care centers, community and home care centers, and \nrehabilitation centers); and (iii) the wage premium from students trained at Yanshan University. \nAt a 12% discount rate, the whole project is found to be economically viable with a net present \nvalue of CNY515.0 million and a base case EIRR of 18.5%. The subproject baseline EIRRs are \nas follows: Chengde City 16.7%, Julu County 22.1%, Li County 16.7%, She County 20.6%, Xinji \nCity 17.3%, and Yanshan University 20.3%.12 \n  \n21.  Financial  sustainability.  Financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  establish  the \nproject\u2019s financial viability.13 The two main analyses conducted were (i) a financial sustainability \nanalysis, including calculation of the financial internal rate of return for revenue-generating \nsubprojects; and (ii) due diligence on the veracity of the proposed counterpart financing plans. \nThe financial analysis shows that the estimated project financial internal rate of return (5.52%) \ncomfortably exceeds the weighted average cost of capital (2.84%) for the overall project. Each \nrevenue-generating subproject also passed this test. The results were robust against all the \nnormal sensitivities, but are most vulnerable to income shortfalls. Financial projections indicate \ncash shortages in the early years of operations, which may require additional financing in adverse \ncircumstances. Difficulties were encountered in obtaining evidence to verify that the proposed \nprivate investors have the necessary financial means and commitment to the project. This has \nbeen resolved by the investors agreeing to make an up-front equity contribution of 20% of total \nsubproject costs. For the Yanshan University subproject, a fiscal sustainability analysis was \nperformed, which shows that net incremental costs of the proposed subproject will constitute a \nmaximum of 1.0% of gross Yanshan University revenues during project construction, decreasing \nto 0.6% once the facilities are fully operational. This incremental burden is considered sustainable.  \nC.  Governance \n22.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines, and identified the main financial management risks as (i) implementation risk: lack of \n                                                \n11 Government of the PRC, Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development. 2015.

The overall financial management risk rating of the project, \nbefore considering mitigating measures, is substantial. Agreed mitigation measures have been \nbuilt into the project design and will be closely monitored during project implementation.14 \n \n23.  A  procurement  risk  assessment  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB  project \nadministration  instructions,  using  a  risk-based  approach.  The  assessment  reveals  that,  at \nexecuting agency level, HPMO, which will oversee project procurement, has extensive experience \nand  proven  performance  in  managing  the  forms  of  procurement  required.  However,  at \nimplementing agency level, capacity is lower and the risk is higher, especially for the privately-\nowned implementing agencies. This risk will be mitigated through HPMO\u2019s oversight, the early \nappointment of an experienced procurement agent, training of implementing agency staff, and \nconsulting support (footnote 14), with increased oversight for the private implementing agencies. \nWith these measures in place, the risk of misprocurement is considered moderate. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and HPG, the executing agency. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n25.  A poverty and social assessment was conducted. Based on the consultations undertaken, \nmost elderly prefer to be taken care of by their children, followed by a preference for HCBC \nservices to support independent living, and then residential care if necessary because of disability \nor lack of care services from the family or community. The expansion of HCBC services under \nthe project will support this strong aging in place preference and address the need for lower cost \ncare services. Individual elderly care decisions are influenced by a variety of factors, including an \nolder person\u2019s health condition, economic status, age, level of education, number of children, \ntraditional elderly care concepts, and social networks. Given the diversity of elderly, their care \nneeds, and income levels, assessing the affordability of ECSS across the population is difficult. \nResidential care, which provides services for disabled elderly, is expensive for most low- and \nmiddle-income elderly. Financing of elderly care is a major issue. This project will take place \nduring a time of rapid developments in policies on subsidies and other support, such as long-term \ncare insurance and the possible use of medical insurance for elderly care. The construction of \nelderly care facilities and their operation will create about 2,200 new jobs. The project will benefit \nabout 300,000 persons in the six project areas when services are operational, and Yanshan \nUniversity will have certified 4,400 students at project completion. The project targets low- and \nmiddle-income elderly, who make up about 40% of the total elderly, and will promote improved \ncare assessment systems to allow care to be directed to those most in need. \n \n26.  Gender. Among the elderly, women typically outnumber, live longer, yet have poorer \nhealth and lower incomes than men. Family contributions often play a significant role in access to \ncare services for both women and men, but to what degree varies among individuals and \n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ncircumstances.  Development  of  elderly  care  will  help  relieve  family  caregivers  and  give \nunsupported elderly better access to care. Benefits will include reduced time burdens for family \ncaregivers and improved job opportunities in a service industry traditionally dominated by females. \nA social and gender action plan has been prepared and agreed.15 \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n28.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE), including an \nenvironmental management plan, was prepared and will be disclosed on the ADB website. The \nIEE complies with ADB\u2019s SPS. The project will help establish safe, operationally and energy-\nefficient public buildings, which meet the two-star national green building standards. The IEE \nconcludes  that  the  project\u2019s  anticipated  environmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  through \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  Some  environmental  impacts  are \nanticipated, including waste, wastewater, noise, fugitive dust, community and occupational health, \nand  safety.  Overall,  implementation-related  impacts  are  localized,  short-term,  and  can  be \neffectively mitigated through the application of good construction and housekeeping practices, \nand implementation of construction phase community and occupational health and safety plans. \nDuring operation, no major environmental impacts are anticipated, and minor impacts will be \naddressed  through  conventional  operation  and  maintenance  practices.  Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  covenants,  capacity  development,  and  institutional-\nstrengthening activities under the project. Environmental complaints or disputes will be handled \nin accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category B). Four resettlement \nplans have been prepared for Xinji City, She County, Shuangluan District, and Li County in \naccordance with government laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s SPS. A total of 168.75 mu of \ncollective land will be affected, most of which is unused land, garden land, and collective \nconstruction land not allocated to any households.16 Of these, 32.37 mu are cultivated land. The \nimpacts on 91 households (310 persons) are marginal as their main source of income is mostly \nnonagricultural, with agricultural income accounting for only 2%\u20134% of their total income. Houses \nto be demolished (1,195 m2) will affect two enterprises and 11 workers. Extensive consultations \nwere carried out during resettlement planning, and key information in the resettlement plans was \ndisclosed in October 2016 by distributing copies of resettlement information booklets to the \naffected villages and households. The resettlement plans have a provision on leasing land and \nproperties for establishing community elderly care centers. The cost of resettlement is estimated \nat CNY28.46 million, including contingencies. Due diligence was carried out for the 39.75 mu of \nproject land previously acquired.17This concluded that resettlement planning and implementation \nwere carried out satisfactorily, in accordance with state and provincial regulations and policies. \nThe executing agency has the capacity to update, implement, and monitor the resettlement plans. \nThe indigenous peoples impact is categorized C. Ethnic minorities make up 4.55% of the total \npopulation in Hebei, of which 71% are Man. Two project sites in Shuangluan District and Chengde \nCity have a larger ethnic minority population, but the social assessment determined that this \npopulation is well-integrated socially and economically in the project areas, and it will not be \nadversely affected by land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n                                                \n15 Social and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n17 Resettlement Plan 4: Xinji City (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.
