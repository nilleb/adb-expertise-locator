THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic  approach  for  the  Competitiveness,  Industrial  Modernization,  and  Trade \nAcceleration Program, and (ii) a proposed policy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of Indonesia \nfor subprogram 1 of the Competitiveness, Industrial Modernization, and Trade Acceleration \nProgram. \n \n2.  The proposed programmatic approach aims to foster a more competitive and investment-\nfriendly business environment in Indonesia and to support an accelerated economic recovery \nfrom the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It combines PBLs with technical assistance \n(TA)  and  knowledge  work  to  support  government  reforms.  A  programmatic  approach  was \nselected as it enables keeping the focus on the overall aim of the program while providing the \nflexibility to address the complexity of multiyear reforms spanning various government ministries \nand the uncertainty arising from the pandemic. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the \nunprecedented  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  economy  contracted  in  2020\u2014by \n2.1%\u2014for the first time since the Asian financial crisis.1 The poverty rate increased to 10.2% in \n \n2020 from 9.2% in 2019, reversing the gains of prior years, while the unemployment rate rose to \n7.1% in 2020 from 5.3% in 2019. Per capita gross national income declined to $3,870 in 2020, \nand Indonesia was reclassified as a lower middle-income country in 2021.2 The Ministry of \nFinance expects growth in 2021 of 3.7%\u20134.5%, down from its earlier outlook of 5.0%\u20135.3% due \n   \nto the knock-on effects arising from the mobility restrictions put in place to stem the spike in \nCOVID-19  infections. 3  The  government\u2019s  macroeconomic  framework,  which  guides  the \nmedium-term fiscal strategy, remains satisfactory. Given the comprehensive social protection and \nstimulus packages to address the pandemic, the 2021 budget targets a deficit of 5.7% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP), while it aims to return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels of fiscal \nprudence by 2023.4 With inflation remaining subdued, the central bank has kept the policy rate at \n3.5%, its lowest level since 2016. General government debt increased to 37.0% of GDP in 2020 \nfrom 30.6% in 2019,5 while total external debt increased to 39.4% of GDP in 2020 from 36.1% in \n2019.6 Nonperforming loan ratios have risen slightly, while the banking sector\u2019s capital adequacy \nratio remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum.7 However, external and public debts \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2021. Asian Development Outlook 2021: Financing a Green and Inclusive \nRecovery. Manila. \n2  In 2020, Indonesia was classified as an upper middle-income country, because its per capita gross national income \nhad reached $4,050 in 2019. \n3  Because of these developments, ADB revised downward its growth projection for 2021 to 3.5% from the earlier \nforecast of 4.5% (Asian Development Outlook 2021 Update). In July 2021, IMF projected the economy to grow by \n3.9% in 2021. \n4  To help cope with the pandemic\u2019s resurgence, outlays on health care, social protection, and business incentives will \nbe increased. In order to maintain the overall deficit target for 2021, outlays in other areas will be adjusted. The \nMinistry of Finance plans for a budget deficit of 4.51%\u20134.85% in 2022. \n5  IMF projects government debt to reach 43% over the medium-term. \n6  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The country economic \nindicators are based on data from the Bank Indonesia.  \n7  According to the Financial Services Authority, nonperforming loan ratios had marginally increased to 3.35% in May \n2021 from 3.1% a year earlier, while the capital adequacy ratio was 24.3% in May 2021, above the minimum \nregulatory threshold of 12.0%. \n \n ", "2 \nremain at sustainable levels.8 Notwithstanding, structural reforms will be important to stimulate \neconomic recovery and to achieve long-term national development goals. \n \n4.  Indonesia aspires to become a high-income country. The government has set a target \nof becoming a high-income country and transforming its economy to be the fifth largest in the \nworld by 2045.9 The abundant natural resource endowment, demographic dividend, and a large \ndomestic market provide the foundation to attain this goal. However, Indonesia\u2019s current growth \nmomentum will not be sufficient. Indonesia\u2019s economic growth peaked at 9.5% in 1995\u20131996, \nafter which growth has declined. Following the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and until 2019, \nIndonesia\u2019s economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.0%, which is not sufficient to support \nits long-term aspiration. For Indonesia to achieve high-income country status by 2045 and support \nan accelerated economic recovery from the pandemic, a growth rate of about 7% per annum will \nbe necessary. \n \n5.  Sources of growth remain narrow. Because the economic expansion has been largely \ndriven by the export of primary commodities, sources of economic growth have been narrowing \nand becoming more volatile. This is exposing the economy to deteriorating terms of trade and, in \nturn, placing balance-of-payment constraints on growth. Manufacturing value added as a share \nof GDP declined from 32% in 2002 to 20% in 2019, while employment in manufacturing as a \nshare of total employment was estimated to be 14.7% in 2018.10 Women\u2019s share of employment \nin manufacturing remained flat at 5.6% during 2001\u20132015, with a persistent gender wage gap.11 \nIn fact, labor productivity growth has been relatively low at 3.1% (1980\u20132019) compared with \n4.8% in Viet Nam.12 Moreover, only a few manufacturing firms in Indonesia grow to a size \nsufficient to drive productivity gains, including labor productivity, and innovation. Without structural \nreform, a faster growth rate will be difficult as Indonesia\u2019s potential growth rate, when all resources \nare fully employed, has declined from 9.50% in 1995\u20131996 to 5.34% in 2017.13  \n \n6.  Higher investments are imperative for faster and broader growth. Currently, private \ninvestment is concentrated in the resources sector and digital economy, with limited impact on \njob creation. Indonesia\u2019s incremental capital output ratio (a measure of investment efficiency) rose \nto 6.3 in 2019 from 4.3 in 2006, compared with 3.4 in Viet Nam in 2019, indicating that the \neconomy  requires  relatively  more  investment  to  support  growth  (Figure  1).  Indonesia  is \nconsidered a nascent country in terms of readiness to benefit from the fourth industrial revolution \nand emerging technologies. It ranked 85th (out of 131 economies) in the 2020 Global Innovation \nIndex (behind Malaysia [33], Viet Nam [42], and Thailand [44]).14 Foreign direct investment (FDI) \ncan play an instrumental role in bringing the latest technologies and know-how into Indonesia, \nwhile also strengthening its readiness for the future of production. However, between 2009 to \n2019, net FDI to Indonesia averaged only 1.9% of GDP, compared with 2.3% of GDP in countries \n \n8  IMF. 2021. Indonesia : 2020 Article IV Consultation-Staff Report.

These are all worrying trends for an economy that will increasingly need to \ncompete  with  other  middle-income  countries  in  manufacturing  to  maintain  growth.  The \ngovernment  has  recognized  these  issues  and  has  identified  the  following  development \nconstraints: (i) the business environment is not conducive for investment; (ii) there are wide \nranging barriers that inhibit trade; and (iii) small firms find it difficult to grow and to upgrade their \noperations.15 \n \nFigure 1: Incremental Capital Output Ratio (3-year moving average)  \n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nIndonesia Viet Nam Malaysia Philippines\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation based on data from  World Development Indicators (accessed \n31 March 2021).

The business environment is not conducive to investment. A host of issues afflicts \nthe investment environment and private sector development in general. An outdated approach to \nbusiness licensing coupled with difficulties in setting up operations discourage FDI in job-creating \nsectors such as manufacturing. Despite reducing the time required to start a business, it still takes \n13 days to complete 11 steps for starting a business. The business licensing process can be \nconfusing and cumbersome for the investors, with differences in processes between central and \n \n15 Sector Assessment (Summary): Industry and Trade (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "4 \nsubnational levels and among subnational administrations. While FDI often plays an important \nrole in technology transfer and spurring domestic investments, Indonesia has the highest barriers \nto FDI among the Group of Twenty (G20) countries (Figure 2). Its score in the OECD index on \nrestrictiveness to FDI worsened to 0.34 in 2019 (with 0 = openness) from 0.31 in 2010, as \ncompared to the global average of 0.06.16 There are many practical impediments facing foreign \ninvestors; for example, poor governance of land transactions makes it difficult to secure sites for \nfactories. Indonesia has established special economic zones (SEZs) in selected geographical \nlocations to address the many operational obstacles faced by investors. However, the uptake by \nthe private sector has been limited because of the overlapping jurisdictions of the central and local \ngovernments and a lack of clarity on the benefits of being in an SEZ.  \n \n8.  Barriers inhibit trade. Well-functioning trade and transport logistics are the backbone of \nany growing economy. Indonesia\u2019s logistics systems are fragmented and inefficient, resulting in \nhigh costs for the private sector. Indonesia ranked 46th in the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance \nIndex in 2018, behind Malaysia (41), Thailand (32), and Viet Nam (39). The time and costs for \ndocumentary compliance as well as cross border trade can be substantial for the private sector. \nThe prevalence of trade barriers contributed to the country\u2019s weak integration in global value chain \n(GVC). Indonesia\u2019s participation in GVCs through both forward and backward linkages declined \nfrom 2000 to 2017. Forward GVC participation declined from 21.5% in 2000 to 12.9% in 2017, \nwhile backward participation declined from 16.9% to 10.1% during the same period.17 For its \nexports to remain competitive, Indonesia will also need to improve the quality of its market access \nin key export destinations. In general, Indonesia needs to open up its economy more if it wants to \nsustain quality growth. \n \n9.  Small firms find it difficult to grow and to upgrade their operations. Micro, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises accounted for 99.9% of the total number of firms and employed 97% \nof the total workforce, while the majority of businesses owned by women operated in the informal \nsector (footnote 1). Because of low levels of productivity, firms in Indonesia are unable to grow, \nfunction as competitive suppliers of inputs to FDI, or meaningfully participate in global value \nchains. Firm productivity is low because investments in upgrading technology and the skill sets of \nworkers are limited. Of the total expenditure on research and development (R&D) (0.08% of \nGDP), only 26% is carried out by the private sector in Indonesia, compared to 73% in Thailand.18 \nFirms point to financial constraints as barriers to the adoption of technologies. Moreover, less \nthan 9% of formal employees in Indonesia have participated in certified workplace training, and \nless than 8% of firms offer formal training to employees. High barriers to entry shields incumbent \nfirms and allows them to survive despite low productivity, while opportunities to partner with larger \nenterprises, including FDI, are limited. In addition, there are severe local content restrictions in \ninfrastructure and other investments, which place Indonesia at a comparative disadvantage when \nit comes to quality investments. \n \n10.  Strategic alignment. The program is aligned with the government\u2019s Vision of Indonesia \n2045 and the National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020\u20132024.19 It is also an \n \n16 In contrast, Viet Nam\u2019s score improved to 0.15 in 2019 from 0.30 in 2010. \n17 ADB. 2019.

Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n11.  Government\u2019s  landmark  reforms.  To  address  these  constraints  on  growth,  the \ngovernment recently launched critical and wide-ranging structural reforms. These reforms are \nguided by the policy direction laid out by President Joko Widodo for his second term in office and \ninclude  promoting  investments,  simplifying  bureaucracy,  and  accelerating  human  capital \ndevelopment.23 In  October  2020,  Indonesia\u2019s  Parliament  approved  the  Job  Creation  Law \n(commonly referred to as the Omnibus Law) that amended 78 laws and targeted improvements \nto  business  licensing  procedures;  hiring  of  workers;  economic  zones;  micro,  small,  and \nmedium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); and research, innovation, and ease of doing business. \nSubsequently,  the  government  has  issued  accompanying  regulations,  demonstrating  its \ncommitment to the implementation of the reforms. In addition, the government\u2019s reform agenda \nalso targets improvements to logistics and trade as well as increasing firm productivity. It also \nadopted the first national definition of MSMEs owned by women, which will help with the formal \nregistration of businesses owned by women and support their growth.24  \n \n12.  Programmatic  approach  and  budget  support.  The  program,  consisting  of  three \nsubprograms, is designed to be an integral part of the government\u2019s post-COVID-19 pandemic \nrecovery strategy. It will focus on creating an enabling environment for investments, easing \nbarriers to trade, and growing and upscaling enterprises. Under the programmatic approach, the \nsubprograms are interlinked and seek to deepen and widen the reforms towards achieving the \nresults targeted by the program (Box 1\u20133). The policy actions under subprogram 1 provide the \nfirst steps of reform with effective implementation under subprogram 2, followed by evaluation of \nthe policy actions for improvement under subprogram 3. The program will complement ADB\u2019s \nbroader programmatic support to Indonesia in the areas of financial inclusion, human capital \ndevelopment, state-owned enterprise reform, and domestic resource mobilization under ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024. \n \n \n20 ADB. 2020.

The strategy adopts the \ndefinition of MSMEs owned by women which draws on the definition used by the International Finance Corporation \nand is aligned with Statistics Indonesia. A business is formally recorded as a women\u2019s business if it meets one of the \nfollowing four criteria: (i) Statistics Indonesia survey respondents recognize that the person responsible for running \nthe business or running the business on a daily basis is a woman; (ii) 51% or more of the business capital is owned \nby women, both from personal capital and from credit; (iii) legal documents (business permit, business certificate, or \nbusiness registration number) are registered under a woman\u2019s name; or (iv) 20% or more of the shares or capital is \nowned by women, a woman is the chief executive officer or chief operating officer, and at least 30% of the board of \ndirectors consists of women (if there is a board of directors). \n \n ", "6 \n1.  Reform Area 1: Creating an Enabling Environment for Investments \n \n13.  Making  businesses  easier  and  faster  to  start.  Policy  actions  in  this  cluster  will \nstreamline the process for starting a business across national and subnational administrations. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  government  newly  established  the  Ministry  of  Investment  and \ncentralized business licensing powers that were previously spread across several agencies.25 \nThe government also installed the Online Single Submission Risk-Based Approach (OSS-RBA) \nsystem at the Ministry of Investment, which represents a risk-based approach to issuing business \nlicenses following international good practice. This streamlined the previous system under which \ninvestors were required to separately obtain various types of licenses and/or permits before \ncompleting their investment plan and starting a business, which added costs and uncertainty. \nWith the reforms under subprogram 1, the steps required for starting a business are halved and \ncan be completed in 4 days from the previous 13 days. Empirical evidence shows that the removal \nof obstacles to obtaining business licenses is associated with an increase in investment flows and \nhigher  productivity.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  upgrade  the  OSS-RBA  to \nincorporate regulations from all line ministries and local governments and roll out the licensing \nsystem across subnational administrations. At present, the online system for the issuance of \nbusiness permits at the subnational level is not consistent across subnational jurisdictions. Under \nsubprogram  3,  the  government  will  evaluate  the  reformed  business  licensing  system  and \nimplement recommendations, with the aim of elevating Indonesia\u2019s position as a top global \ndestination for investment.  \n \n14.

The  government  also \nprovided  tax  holidays,  investment \nallowances, and import duty exemptions to attract investments in industry sectors.26 These \ntargeted incentives, which are to be reviewed periodically, form part of the broader reform push \nto attract investments, know-how, and technology. Fiscal and nonfiscal incentives, when part of \na broader set of reforms, are seen to increase FDI inflows with positive multiplier effects. Under \nsubprogram 2, the government will approve at least one foreign investment in pioneer industries.27 \nUnder subprogram 3, the government will evaluate the effectiveness of the fiscal and nonfiscal \nincentives and implement recommended measures. \n \n25 On 28 April 2021, the government established the Ministry of Investment by upgrading the bureaucratic status of the \nInvestment Coordinating Board\u2014a government agency mandated to boost domestic investment and FDI\u2014to a fully-\nfledged government ministry. The chair of the Investment Coordinating Board assumed the new role of the Minister \nof Investment. \n26 Tax incentives will be processed through the OSS-RBA, increasing transparency and predictability for investors.  \n27 New investments in the production of batteries for electric vehicles is an example. Such investment could have a \ntransformative impact on the automotive sector. \n \n ", "7 \n15.  Simplifying land-related transactions for investors. Policy actions in this cluster are \ndedicated to making it easier for investors to acquire land. Under subprogram 1, the government \ndigitalized  land  management  systems,  which  will  allow  for  electronic  processing  of  land \nregistration. It also increased the duration of certain land titles and the duration of their extensions: \nFor example, the duration of rights-to-use land titles was automatically extended from 25 years to \n30 years, with a provision for extension for an additional 20 years. Improvements in property rights \nin Indonesia are associated with a 35% overall increase in productivity.28 Under subprogram 2, \nthe government will simplify procedures for foreign ownership of strata titles (e.g., apartment units) \nand establish land titles for both above and below ground. Specifically, land titles for below ground \nwill be established for the first time, which will be vital for infrastructure projects such as \nunderground mass transit systems. Under subprogram 3, the government will strengthen the \ntransparency and accuracy of information regarding landholder rights and protections. \n \n16.  Enhancing the attractiveness of special economic zones to investors. Policy actions \nin this cluster will make it easier to establish manufacturing and other facilities in SEZs. Under \nsubprogram 1, the government centralized the management of SEZs under a national council, \nwhich eliminated the overlap of jurisdictions between the central and subnational governments \nand the associated complexity for businesses. It permitted, for the first time, the education and \nhealth sectors to operate in SEZs, which will also open the possibility for much-needed foreign \ninvestments in these sectors.29 Under subprogram 2, the government will further strengthen the \nbusiness case for operating in SEZs by providing exemptions to subnational taxes and levies and \nreducing taxes and duties when purchasing land and/or setting up operations in SEZs. Under \nsubprogram 3, the government will streamline the process for obtaining land rights, extensions, \nand renewals for investments in an SEZ, making them faster to obtain. ADB will be working with \nthe government to ensure that tax incentives will be aligned with the overall domestic resource \nmobilization efforts in the post-COVID-19 era. \n \n2.  Reform Area 2: Easing Barriers to Trade \n \n17.  Improving the national logistic ecosystem. Policy actions in this cluster will simplify and \nreduce  the  cost  of  moving  goods  across  borders.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government \nstreamlined and accelerated clearances by alleviating the longstanding silos across approving \nauthorities. The new National Logistic Ecosystem connected logistics systems across various \ngovernment agencies as well as between government agencies and the private sector. Logistics \nservice providers will be able to seamlessly connect via the online platform with the government \nagencies responsible for different approval nodes along the logistics chain, which will speed up \nthe flow of goods and accompanying documentation from the point of arrival until the goods reach \nthe destination warehouses. Under subprogram 2, the government will pilot an online single \nsubmission system for the logistics-related approval process and payments and will roll out a \nsingle operating system for port operators. An integrated container service and delivery logistics \nplatform will be established in large ports (e.g., Medan, Surabaya, Semarang, and Jakarta). Under \nsubprogram 3, the government will connect the logistics platform with primary modes of transport \nfor containers such as rail transport, with the aim of establishing an integrated multimodal logistics \nsystem. \n \n28 C.

Following the reforms, \ninvestments in SEZs are not subject to foreign ownership limitations and special conditions that otherwise apply to a \nparticular business sector. Investors, whether foreign or domestic, are provided with tax holidays and allowances on \ntheir investments as well as exemption from duties when importing capital goods. There are currently 11 SEZs \nalready operating in Indonesia and an additional four are in development. \n \n ", "8 \n18.

Under  subprogram  3,  the \ngovernment will continue to upgrade the NSW by including air transport, so that goods transported \nby air can also be processed expeditiously. It will also expand the NSW\u2019s monitoring dashboard \nto include monitoring of SME exports to support SMEs\u2019 participation in global value chains. \n \n19.  Facilitating trade. Policy actions in this cluster support expansion of international trade. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government ratified the Indonesia\u2013Australia Free Trade Agreement \n(officially referred to as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) and signed the \nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership \nAgreement ensures duty-free tariffs for bilateral trade between Indonesia and Australia, while the \nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is expected to boost Indonesia\u2019s exports by 11% \nand investments by 18%\u201322% by 2028. ADB\u2019s regional technical assistance on trade facilitation \n \nsupported the implementation of these trade agreements.30 Under subprogram 2, the government \nwill develop a plan for opening government procurement opportunities to foreign suppliers for the \nfirst time. The expansion of international competition will contribute to better value for money for \ngoods and services procured by the government. To promote the participation of businesses \nowned by women, the government will identify potential goods and services that could be supplied \nby  businesses  owned  by  women  and  develop  a  program  of  support  with  targets.  Under \nsubprogram 3, the government will implement the plan for opening government procurement \nunder  free  trade  agreements,  operationalize  online  registration  with  sex-disaggregated \ninformation  of  suppliers,  and  implement  a  support  program  to  strengthen  participation  of \nbusinesses owned by women in government procurement processes for relevant goods and \nservices. \n \n3.  Reform Area 3: Growing and Upscaling Enterprises \n \n20.  Encouraging  growth  in  businesses.  Policy  actions  in  this  cluster  will  remove \nimpediments to business growth, especially for MSMEs.

Support \nfor MSMEs, including permitting foreign investment and integrating them into the product value \nchain, can accelerate the process of upscaling enterprises. Under subprogram 2, the government \nwill develop a new national plan for MSMEs that will guide the activities of all relevant government \nagencies and include pertinent thematic issues such as gender and climate. It will launch an \nintegrated MSME system with sex-disaggregated data to improve formulation of policies designed \nto help MSMEs grow and upscale. Under subprogram 3, the government will establish business \nincubators targeting MSMEs across the government at central and subnational levels, academia, \nand the private sector. Policies on connecting MSMEs to global value chains will be improved \nwhile targeting at least 30% of such MSMEs to be businesses owned by women. The outcomes \nof the reforms are expected to benefit 27.6 million businesses owned by women (footnote 22). \n \n21.

Under subprogram 3, the government will implement \nregulations to facilitate the effective and sustainable operations of existing and new science and \ntechnology parks to strengthen the research and development ecosystem. \n \n22.  Value  addition  and  sustainability.  The  program  is  anchored  in  ADB\u2019s  flagship \nknowledge work on Indonesia\u2019s growth potential, which was discussed at key policy development \nforums (footnotes 13 and 18). ADB provided TA to review selected implementing regulations of \nthe Job Creation Law relevant to the program, develop a draft government regulation on land \nvalue mapping, and assess the readiness of construction-related services to be liberalized under \na  government  procurement  chapter  in  free  trade  agreements.31 The  program  also  reflects \ndialogue with nongovernment stakeholders in academia, think tanks, and civil society. The \nprogram will seek to ensure the sustainability of the reforms by: (i) providing regular knowledge \ninputs and supporting policy dialogue; (ii) developing partnerships with stakeholders, including by \nleveraging  the  country  programming  dialogue;  (iii)  providing  targeted  TA  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  reforms;  and  (iv)  building  synergy  with  ADB\u2019s  other  sovereign  and \nnonsovereign operations (para. 24). \n \n23.  Lessons. The programmatic approach builds on more than a decade of coordinated \nsupport for policy reforms that includes changing energy subsidies, building finance sector \n \n31 ADB. 2020.

More recently, the Stepping Up \nInvestments for Growth Acceleration Program helped the government promote a more predictable \nand open business environment, encourage private sector participation in infrastructure, and \nimprove public procurement.32 These engagements led to the improvement in doing business, \nlargely because of improvements in getting electricity, getting credit, paying taxes, and resolving \ninsolvency. The lessons suggest that programs need to consider the differing capabilities at the \nnational and subnational levels as well as the overlapping regulations, which the program seeks \nto address. The program also incorporates in its design the lesson that support for complex, \ncross-sector reforms is best achieved through a programmatic approach. In addition, there is \ncontinuous information exchange and knowledge sharing between ADB and other development \npartners on what works in policy reforms. \n \n24.  Sovereign and nonsovereign collaboration. Closely aligned with the government\u2019s \npandemic  recovery  efforts,  the  measures  in  the  program  are  aimed  at  boosting  private \ninvestments. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) and Office of Public-Private \nPartnership (OPPP) provided inputs to the design of the program as core team members, and the \nSoutheast Asia Department, PSOD, and OPPP staff will work closely in evaluating the progress \nof the reforms through the entire program cluster to meet the overall aim. This is in line with the \ncollaborative approach adopted under the country partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024. \nThe program will help attract more foreign investment into Indonesia while ensuring that private \nsector projects become more competitive as more companies bid for limited projects. Additionally, \nthe program will likely contribute to a reduction in the time needed for projects to come online as \nthe  process  from  concept  to  bid  stage,  financial  close,  and  construction  becomes  more \nstreamlined. ADB\u2019s OPPP and PSOD are already collaborating and disseminating information on \nADB\u2019s capability for advisory, structuring, and lending for key projects. The results of the program \ncould open more opportunities for leveraging private capital, including FDI, through OPPP and \nPSOD operations in Indonesia. \n \n25.  Development partner coordination. The government, through the Coordinating Ministry \nfor Economic Affairs (CMEA), leads development partner coordination on reforms targeting \ncompetitiveness, industries, and trade.33 As part of the regular country programming dialogue, \nADB closely coordinates with the IMF, the World Bank, and bilateral funding agencies on PBLs \nto Indonesia. ADB discussed the program with the IMF\u2019s representative office in Jakarta. In June \n2021, the World Bank approved a development policy loan targeting reforms in investments and \ntrade. Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through its economic governance \nprogram,  Prospera,  is providing  technical  support  on  policy  analysis.  The  United  Kingdom \nprovided support on regulatory development and a surveillance mechanism for the OSS-RBA. \nThe program has benefitted from close coordination with the program\u2019s cofinancing partners, the \nGerman development cooperation through KfW and the Export-Import Bank of Korea. \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n26.  The program\u2019s impact will be strengthened economic resilience for quality growth and \nreduced  disparities  between  regions  in  line  with  the  Vision  of  Indonesia  2045  and  the \nRPJMN 2020\u20132024 (footnote 19).

The program will contribute to the government\u2019s medium-term development\ntargets.  It  will  help  Indonesia  establish  integrated  multimodal  goods  transport  and  border\nclearance (customs, immigration, and quarantine) and improve its score in the World Bank\nLogistics Performance Index (from 3.1 in 2019 to 3.5 in 2026). As a result of the reforms,\nreductions in logistics costs are expected to be equivalent to 3.9% of GDP. The program will also\nhelp Indonesia increase its manufacturing exports from $115.7 billion (in 2019) to $183.4 billion\n(in 2026). The program will support the expansion of MSMEs' output to 65% of GDP (from 57% of\nGDP  in  2019)  and  establish  an  integrated  data  system  to  improve  inter-ministerial  policy\ncoordination and targeting for MSMEs. The program will also help reduce restrictions on FDI,\nwhich is expected to increase annual FDI inflows to Indonesia (from Rp423 trillion in 2019 to\nRp800 trillion by 2026).34\nBox 4: Achievements under Subprogram 1 \n\u2713 Starting a business will take about 4 days and 6 steps (from 13 days and 11 steps).\n\u2713 Digital land registration was established, increasing transparency for investors.\n\u2713 For the first time, foreign investors were permitted to invest in technology-based start-ups in SEZs.\n\u2713 Eight new sectors including health, education, financial services, and digital economy are permitted to\noperate in SEZs.\n\u2713 The private sector will achieve border clearance for goods in a matter of hours (from 2\u20133 days on\naverage earlier).\n\u2713 Trade agreements are expected to boost exports by 11% and investments by 18%\u201322% by 2028.\n\u2713 Export\u2013import licensing is automatic for \u201creputable traders\u201d.\n\u2713 The private sector will benefit from substantial tax breaks for investing in research and development\n(300% of cost) and workers\u2019 skill development (200% of cost).\n\u2713 Approval time for brand application by small and medium-sized enterprises declined to 30 days (from\n150 days).\nSEZ = special economic zone. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n28. Specific benefits to the private sector. The program will lower barriers for investors,\nreduce costs to and increase transparency for the private sector, increase competitiveness, and\nfacilitate enterprise growth in Indonesia.35 Reform area 1 is expected to, among other things,\nsimplify the regulatory requirements for business registration and licensing by reducing the\nnumber of steps needed to start a limited-liability company, hence cutting the time needed to start\na new business. Reform area 2 is expected to improve the efficiency of trade logistics, which will\ntranslate to private sector cost savings. In addition to facilitating the shift from a manual to an\nonline process for \u201cdelivery order and container release approval,\u201d data sharing across ministries\nand agencies will enable a single online submission mechanism for a more efficient clearance \nand approval process. Reform area 3 will open opportunities for foreign investment in technology-\nbased start-ups and provide incentives to firms to invest in R&D and develop workers\u2019 skills. To\nensure that a consistent pace of reforms and the intended effects are felt by private sector \nbeneficiaries, a monitoring and feedback mechanism to troubleshoot and guide policy updates \nwill be implemented (para. 32). \n34 Simulation results show that a 5% year-over-year increase in FDI could add 0.22% to annual economic growth by \n2040.

Development Financing Needs and Budget Support\n29. In 2021, the government plans for a budget deficit of 5.7% of GDP (para. 3), and the\nprojected financing needs are $99.1 billion. The financing needs will be met through domestic\n($70.8  billion\u2013$83.0  billion)  and  foreign  ($19.0  billion\u2013$23.5  billion)  sources.  The  proposed\nprogrammatic  approach  comprising  three  subprograms  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.5  billion. \nSubprogram 1 of $500 million is estimated to represent 0.5% of the government\u2019s financing needs\nin 2021.  \n30. The government has requested a regular loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital\nresources toward financing subprogram 1. Loans for subprograms 2 and 3 have been set at an\nindicative amount of $500 million each. The size of the loans is based on the country\u2019s current \nfinancing needs and the impact of the reforms, although the financing needs could increase \nbecause of the impacts of the pandemic. The loan for subprogram 1 will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line repayment method, the average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity \npremium payable to ADB. German development cooperation through KfW will provide parallel \ncofinancing in the amount of $354.25 million equivalent for subprogram 1, and the Export-Import \nBank of Korea through the Economic Development Cooperation Fund, $100.00 million. The Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency indicated interest in subprogram 1 and may provide cofinancing \nat a later stage. ADB staff will work closely with the government in ensuring that ADB\u2019s annual \nlending program has the right balance between policy reforms and investment projects. \nE. Implementation Arrangements\n31. The CMEA will be the executing agency. The implementing agencies will be the CMEA,\nMinistry for Investment/Investment Coordinating Board, the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and\nSpatial  Planning/National  Land  Agency,  Ministry  of  Cooperatives  and  Small  and  Medium\nEnterprises, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade, the National Research and Innovation Agency,\nand the National Public Procurement Agency. ADB has built a strong partnership with the\nexecuting agency in implementing large reform programs and enjoys regular policy engagements\nwith the implementing agencies. The implementation period will be July 2019\u2013June 2021 for\nsubprogram 1, July 2021\u2013June 2023 for subprogram 2, and July 2023\u2013June 2025 for subprogram\n3. All policy actions in subprogram 1 have been completed. The proceeds of the PBL will be\nwithdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to\ntime).36 \n32. Program  monitoring  mechanisms.  The  CMEA,  the  executing  agency,  will  hold\nmonitoring meetings twice a year with the implementing agencies, the private sector (represented\nby the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry), ADB, and the program\u2019s cofinancing\npartners. Chaired by its deputy minister for macroeconomy, the CMEA will (i) monitor the \nimplementation of the reform actions, and (ii) coordinate knowledge work and TA provided by \nADB and the program\u2019s cofinancing partners. The findings and discussions from the monitoring\nmeetings will guide the implementation of the program as well as inform the government\u2019s broader\nreform measures, including updates to the implementing regulations of the Job Creation Law. \n36 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "13 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n33.  Poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the poverty rate to spike, which stood at 10.1% \nin 2021\u2014turning back years of progress in poverty reduction.37 The job losses, work stoppages, \nand reduced working hours may push many more workers and their families into poverty. In 2021, \nthe unemployment rate stood at 6.3%, a slight improvement from 7.1% in 2020 that marked the \nhighest rate in a decade and corresponded to about 9.8 million unemployed workers. Reform \nactions supported by the program will contribute to increased investments, job creation and \npoverty reduction. As starting businesses becomes easier and faster, it will encourage would-be \nentrepreneurs to start their own businesses, which in turn will create productive employment \nopportunities particularly for the youth. The program will also support the upscaling and growth of \nMSMEs, which are expected to have large impact on employment and poverty reduction.   \n \n34.  Gender.  Subprogram  1  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements,  while \nsubprograms  2  and  3  will  target  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  female  labor  force \nparticipation rate (53.13%) is significantly lower than for males (82.41%). Accurate, regular, \nsex-disaggregated statistics are not yet available, because until 2020 there was no definition of \nbusinesses owned or led by women. Comprehensive, current, and disaggregated data are critical \nto designing and implementing a cohesive and well-coordinated approach to support MSMEs, \nincluding  those  owned  by  women.  Subprogram  1  focused  on  addressing  the  lack  of \ncomprehensive data on businesses owned by women by integrating sex-disaggregated data in \nthe system at the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises. Subsequent \nsubprograms will build on these actions by incorporating the definition of businesses owned by \nwomen as stated in the National Women\u2019s Financial Inclusion Strategy (footnote 24) in the new \nintegrated national plan on MSMEs. They will also support opening more opportunities for \nbusinesses to access markets through gender-responsive procurement, capacity building, and \nincubation programs for businesses owned by women. \n \n35.  Governance.  The  overall  investment  climate  in  Indonesia  is  dampened  by  the \noverabundance of regulations, procedures, and overlapping jurisdictions. For example, getting a \nbusiness license or setting up operations in SEZs requires getting approval from a number of \ndifferent authorities across the national and subnational governments. The long and ineffective \nbusiness settlement process makes contract enforcements difficult.38 Moving goods into and \nwithin the country also requires approvals by various agencies spread across the government. \nThe program supports the government\u2019s reform efforts\u2014that target whole-of-government\u2014in \nstreamlining governance issues that are holding back investments. The reforms are expected to \nincrease predictability and transparency for the private sector in doing business in Indonesia. \n \n36.  Public financial management. The framework for public financial management is well-\nestablished and is supported by systems that cover internal controls, accounting and reporting \nprocedures, and internal and external audit systems.39 The 2017 public expenditure and financial \naccountability assessment concluded that Indonesia has a strong legal and regulatory framework \nfor fiscal management and control of budget execution, with 17 out of 31 indicators scoring above \nthe basic alignment with international good practice.40 Indicators with particularly good results \nincluded transparency of public finance, accounting, and reporting.

The program will have climate adaptation and mitigation co-benefits and \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  nationally  determined  contributions  under  the  Paris  Agreement. \nSubprogram  1  is  assessed  to  contribute  $49.08  million  in  climate  change  adaptation  and \n$48.14 million in climate change mitigation.41 \n \n38.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 \nsafeguards. The program is not expected to have significant adverse environmental or social \nsafeguard impacts within the meaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).42 The \nreforms under the program introduce new processes that draw on international good practice, but \nthat are not yet tested in the country, particularly the risk-based approach (OSS-RBA) for business \nlicensing. To mitigate any unanticipated safeguard concerns,  the program incorporates the \nfollowing three key elements. First, it will have a sustained engagement with the reforms and will \nsupport their continued improvement throughout the program\u2019s implementation. For example, for \nthe issuance of business licenses, policy actions in subprogram 1 supported the consolidation of \nthe online single submission, using the OSS-RBA; subprogram 2 will help upgrade the OSS-RBA \nby  aligning  and  streamlining  the  regulations  of  relevant  line  ministries  and  subnational \nadministrations; and subprogram 3 will support the implementation of the recommendations from \nthe evaluation of the OSS-RBA. Second, the program includes periodic monitoring (para. 32), \nwhich will review progress against policy actions, including those relating to safeguard issues. It \nwill also review the findings of the OSS-RBA system walk-throughs, which will consider safeguard \naspects, and discuss measures to address implementation issues. Third, ADB is providing TA to \nthe implementing agencies which will include support on safeguards (footnote 31).43 ADB\u2019s TA \nwill be closely coordinated with development partners that are also supporting the government in \nthese  reform  areas,  including  the  World  Bank,  the  Governments  of  Australia,  and  the \nUnited Kingdom. \n \n39.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 1 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.44  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nWorsening COVID-19  At the country level, ADB is providing vaccine financing and TA to the government and \npandemic coupled with  Bio Farma, the entity responsible for vaccine procurement.
