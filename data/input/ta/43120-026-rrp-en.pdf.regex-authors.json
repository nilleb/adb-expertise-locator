THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the additional financing of the Trade \nFacilitation: Improved Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Handling in Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) Trade Project.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original Trade Facilitation: Improved \nSPS Handling in GMS Trade Project in June 2012.2 The project aims to strengthen institutional \nsupport and develop capacity for SPS handling in Cambodia and the Lao PDR through improved \nsurveillance and monitoring of plant health, animal health, and food safety; the creation of a pool \nof SPS specialists through better tertiary education in food sciences; and enhanced regional \ncooperation in SPS handling.3 Based on the success of the current project in its delivery of \noutputs, the Government of the Lao PDR requested additional financing to scale up project \nactivities, include additional provinces for support under the project, and commence nationwide \nrollout  of  the  food  safety  management  system.4 The  project  will  facilitate  greater  trade  in \nagriculture, food, and forestry (AFF) products through an increase in focus on improving SPS \nmeasures for plant health, animal health, and food safety applicable to key trade requirements of \nthe GMS. The additional financing will scale up activities in the three main outputs: (i) surveillance \nand inspection for plant health, animal health, and food safety; (ii) enhanced education levels and \nuniversity training of SPS specialists; and (iii) regional cooperation and harmonization for SPS \nmeasures and practices. The project will be implemented by the Lao PDR Ministry of Agriculture \nand Forestry (MAF). The current project\u2019s approach and structure remain valid. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The current project was developed based on the commitment of the Lao PDR to implement \nthe  GMS  regional  cooperation  strategy  of  connectivity  and  competitiveness.5 While  recent \ninvestments in physical infrastructure have improved connectivity and created new opportunities \nfor  trade,  governments  in  the  region  recognize  that  weak  national  legal,  institutional,  and \noperational capacity for delivering SPS services has hindered the establishment of a harmonized \nand robust GMS framework for SPS, which has impeded growth in exports of food products and \nincomes  of  farm  households.  Governments  in  the  GMS  need  to  invest  in  national  SPS \nmanagement systems from farm to table, and coordinate SPS service delivery better across \njurisdictions.6 The current project has been successful in improving  legal, institutional, and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Grant, and \nTechnical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Trade Facilitation: \nImproved Sanitary and Phytosanitary Handling in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila. SPS measures and issues \nare defined in the 1994 World Trade Organization Subsidiary Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \nPhytosanitary Measures. \n3  The GMS includes Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n4  The Government of Cambodia has deferred its request for additional financing as it continues to implement activities \nunder the current project and TA 8732-REG. \n5  Greater Mekong Subregion. 1992. GMS Economic Cooperation Program. GMS. \n6  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Implementing the Greater Mekong Subregion Core Agriculture Support \nProgram (Phase 2). Manila. (TA 8163-REG). This TA is facilitating the development of the GMS Strategy and Action \nPlan on Promoting Safe and Environment Friendly Agro-Based Value Chains in the Greater Mekong Subregion for \n2018\u20132022. Based on an agro-based value chain approach, the strategy has two pillars: policies and investments, \nand certification of food safety and quality. The resulting GMS strategy and action plan document is envisaged for \nendorsement by the GMS agriculture ministers during the third quarter of 2017.  \n ", "2 \noperational  capacities  for  SPS  service  delivery  in  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR;  including \nmanagement  and  cooperation  on  essential  SPS  issues  to  be  resolved  in  the  region. \nAchievements under the project include market access agreements with bilateral trading partners \nfor key AFF exports, upgrades to laboratory equipment crucial for testing and analysis of plant \nand animal health and food safety, and updated curricula and teaching methodology for SPS \neducation in the Faculty of Agriculture at the National University of Laos. Under the current project, \nthe governments of Cambodia and the Lao PDR have successfully pilot tested a food safety \nscheme involving the assessment and grading of food establishments. Technical assistance (TA) \non Enhancing Capacity for SPS Arrangements to Facilitate Trade in the GMS is also supporting \nprogress by providing for cooperation between customs and SPS agencies, regional capacity \nbuilding, and the development of a monitoring and evaluation framework (footnote 4). National \ntrade data show clear benefits such as the increased export volume of AFF goods resulting from \nimproved SPS management systems under ADB\u2019s support. For example, under the framework of \nmarket access agreements with bilateral partners, rice exports from the Lao PDR to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China have increased 400% from 2015 to 2017.7 Other AFF products experienced \nrobust export growth from 2012 to 2015, such as corn (67%) and cassava (328%).  \n4.  Despite this progress, additional financing is required to support reforms in the Lao PDR \nto  enhance  SPS  institutions  and  operational  capacity  in  line  with  the  country\u2019s  GMS \ncommitments.8 The current project focuses on improved surveillance and monitoring of plant \nhealth, animal health, and food safety in three provinces9, while additional provinces such as \nSavannakhet and Oudomxay require support under the project. Additional financing will facilitate \nthe rollout of a national food safety management system, including a ratings scheme of food \nestablishments, to improve food safety for the population and visitors to the Lao PDR. Enhancing \nfood safety in the Lao PDR will boost its reputation as a tourism destination, which is imperative \nas tourism accounts for 6.4% of gross domestic product. The first batch of food science students \nfrom the project will graduate in 2018, and additional investments are needed to ensure a \nsufficient number of qualified food scientists in the long term.  \n5.  Eligibility criteria for additional financing. The proposed project meets the eligibility \ncriteria of being: (i) technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) accorded \nhigh priority by the government; and (iii) consistent with the project\u2019s developmental objectives. \nAs  the  current  country partnership  strategy for  2017\u20132021  is  being  drafted, the  additional \nfinancing is included in the country operations business plan for the Lao PDR, 2017\u20132019.10 The \nreview missions for the project confirmed its technical and economic viability, and economic \nsoundness. Based on the targets of the Lao PDR National Strategy for Agricultural Development, \n2011\u20132022,11 the  project  is  aligned  with government  priorities. The  proposal for  additional \nfinancing will allow a scale-up of project activities in outputs 1 to 3, expanding coverage to \nadditional  provinces,  supporting  the  nationwide  rollout  of  the  ratings  scheme  of  food \nestablishments, and enhancing the Lao PDR\u2019s coordination on SPS matters in the GMS. The \ncurrent project is also aligned with the GMS 10-year Strategic Framework, 2012\u2013202212 and \nfacilitates cross-border trade and investment, including continued progress of the Lao PDR\u2019s SPS \nmanagement and monitoring under the current project.The project will contribute to pillar 4 \n \n(cooperation in regional public goods) of ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy.13  \n                                                \n7  Other bilateral market access agreement partners include Thailand and Viet Nam. \n8  Based on current project implementation progress, additional financing will be provided to the Lao PDR while \nadditional support will be provided to Cambodia at a later stage.  \n9  Vientiane capital, Luang Prabang and Pakse \n10 ADB. 2016.

Only two of the top five exports from the Lao PDR are AFF products, while over 70% of \nits labor force is engaged in agriculture. Exports of other AFF products could be expanded \nsignificantly by raising productivity in agriculture and reducing SPS-related barriers to exports of \nthese products through market access agreements with trading partners for key crops. From 2010 \nto 2014, exports of AFF products increased by over 90%.14 Nevertheless, poor SPS management \ncapacities continue to limit market access for many AFF products from the Lao PDR, both in the \nGMS and globally. The Government of the Lao PDR has limited institutional and human resources \nto protect crops, livestock, and consumers against health hazards caused by plant pests, animal \ndiseases, and food-borne diseases. While the current project has facilitated better SPS systems, \nthe Lao PDR needs more sustained and scaled up assistance to ensure  longer-term SPS \ncapabilities.  Effective  national  SPS  management  systems  are  building  blocks  for  regional \nharmonization and for establishing trust among GMS countries in each other\u2019s SPS measures. \n \n7.  Despite the significant improvement resulting from the current project, Lao PDR continues \nto faces challenges in: (i) undertaking surveys on crop pests and diseases required by market \naccess agreements; (ii) undertaking risk management through inspections and interceptions of \nimported products; (iii) monitoring trade and use of agricultural pesticides required by market \naccess agreements; (iv) updating and understanding new risks of forest pest spread associated \nwith trade in wood and forest products; and (v) maintaining and expanding the regional trade in \ncrop  products.  Lao  PDR  also  needs  to:  (i)  continue  containment  of  transboundary  animal \ndiseases; (ii) improve surveillance of veterinary drugs and feed; and (iii) improve animal food \nproduct safety. Food safety practices are poor and awareness of the importance of food safety is \nlow, resulting in very high levels of food-borne illness; inadequate attention to food safety in food \nestablishments; and inadequate monitoring of food, food establishments, and food poisoning \noutbreaks. Food safety supervision has added importance, given the increasing tourist volumes \nin the Lao PDR. \n \n8.  Compliance with global SPS requirements requires national specialists to undertake tasks \nrelated  to  surveillance,  risk  analysis,  testing,  pest  identification,  production  standards,  and \nconformity assessment. Given the large proportion of the local labor force in the agriculture sector, \nit is important to invest in the education of future SPS specialists who will help ensure the quality \nand safety of AFF goods. Trading partners and private companies often require the application of \ngood agricultural practices, good manufacturing practices, and quality assurance management \n(such as hazard analysis critical control point systems). The Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  has  established  regional  cooperation  on  food  safety  and  harmonized  standards \nrecognition for agricultural products. GMS countries are considering the establishment of a trade \nfacilitation working group, with two subgroups for customs and SPS, to meet as required.15 As the \nLao PDR increasingly participates in regional and global trade, it will need to ensure that AFF \ngoods exports meet the stringent standards of importing countries. However, specialists who can \nperform these surveillance and analytical tasks are lacking. The current project introduced SPS \ntraining at the National University of Laos, and the first batch of locally trained SPS specialists will \njoin the workforce in 2018. Continued support in this area would help strengthen the capacities of \nSPS agencies in the Lao PDR by supplementing their staff with locally trained experts. \n \n9.  Lessons.  The project builds on past and ongoing technical assistance related to SPS \nsupported by development partners and ADB. Enforcement of SPS standards and management \nsystems remains a challenge in the Lao PDR. Experience shows that due to limited government \nabsorptive capacity, donors must adopt a phased approach to formulate well-targeted and \n                                                \n14 Government of the Lao PDR, Lao PDR Trade Portal. http://laotradeportal.gov.la/index.php. \n15 The proposal to reactivate the trade facilitation working group will be submitted for consideration and endorsement \nby the GMS ministers in September 2017. ", "4 \nsequenced projects to ensure the implementation of bilateral and regional commitments on \ncooperation and harmonization. An integrated approach to the three main areas of concern (i.e. \nfood safety, animal health and plant health) is beneficial so as to develop a common framework \nfor SPS standards. Development partners such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations and the United States Agency for International Development support other aspects \nof  SPS  capacity  building  in  the  GMS,  including  legislative  and  regulatory  reform,  which \ncomplement the project and contribute to addressing SPS issues comprehensively. \n \n10.  The current project has delivered pest lists for 11 crops, which were crucial for meeting \nbilateral market access agreements requirements, as well as food safety training to improve risk \nmanagement and hazard response, including for food manufacturing establishments. The current \nproject is rated on track by ADB\u2019s project performance rating system. As of 31 August 2017, \noverall physical implementation progress of the project was estimated at 93% against the elapsed \nimplementation period of 91%. Cumulative contract awards amount to $13.4 million or 97% of net \nproject amount while cumulative disbursements amount to $12 million or 87% of net project \namount. Identified risks such as weak institutional capacity were mitigated through staff training \nand capacity building in the project management unit as well as component implementation units \n(CIUs). Since project effectiveness, ADB has conducted seven review missions and confirmed \nthat: (i) implementation progress has been satisfactory and no substantial changes to project \ndesign and approach are envisioned; (ii) MAF and CIUs have the capacity, experience, and \nexpertise needed to implement ADB-financed projects; and (iii) the current project interventions \nhave produced tangible benefits to the Lao PDR. Cambodia has opted to defer any additional \nfinancing until 2019, in line with its implementation schedule for completing activities and the \nproject pipeline. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impact  remains  unchanged  for  the  additional  financing  project:  Lao  PDR  AFF \nproducts that are safer, more efficiently produced, and traded in greater quantities. The outcome \nwill  be  an  enhanced  SPS  management  system  in  the  Lao  PDR,  which  will  contribute  to \nintraregional trade, export competitiveness, and health protection. With additional financing, \ncurrent project progress will be scaled up to include coverage of more provinces16 in the Lao PDR \nand a greater number of staff receiving capacity building.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n1.  Output 1: Strengthened Surveillance and Inspection Programs \n \n12.  Plant health. Assistance will continue to focus on: (i) surveillance to maintain the pest lists \nfor 15 products developed under the current project and additional pest lists for another five crops \nfor use in market access arrangements with countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), Thailand, and Viet Nam (the current project enabled market access agreements for rice \nexports to the PRC, and additional financing will support additional crops such as Job\u2019s tears, and \ncassava market access agreements); (ii) strengthening related pest identification, diagnostic, and \nanalytical  services  through  investments  in  laboratory  facilities,  equipment,  and  training; \n(iii) improving the capacity to approve pesticides formulation analysis, monitoring, and its residual \ntesting;  (iv)  improving  the  capacity  to  respond  to  pest  forecast  and  outbreaks;  \n(v) doubling the capacity to provide post-entry quarantine for new plant species following the \nconstruction of the first post-entry quarantine facility under the current project; and (vi) improving \n                                                \n16 Including Bolikhamxay,Champasak, Khammuane, Xiengkhouang, and Savannakhet. ", "5 \ninternational reporting of pest situations and strengthening the supply chains associated with crop \nproducts.  \n \n13.  Animal health. The focus will continue to be on: (i) strengthening transboundary animal \ndiseases surveillance and response programs by extending the transboundary animal diseases \nsurveillance work being undertaken in two provinces under the current project to two further \nprovinces;  (ii)  improving  disease  management  capacities  for  priority  transboundary  animal \ndiseases (foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever); (iii) improving the management of \nrisks associated with the movement of live animals, with additional financing supporting the \ndevelopment and implementation of a national strategy to control illegal animal trade;17 and \n(iv) improving the monitoring of veterinary drugs, animal feeds, and animal products safety \nmonitoring. \n \n14.  Food safety. The focus will continue to be on: (i) maintaining and expanding the size of \nthe current food safety surveillance program to assess more hazards and ensure its effective \nimplementation nationwide after the pilot work done under the current project; (ii) providing \ntraining to 700 more food establishments on food safety hazards management, in addition to the \n800 food premises trained under the current project, and grading a further 360 food premises in \naddition to the 360 premises graded under the current project; (iii) providing specific training in \ngood manufacturing practices and good hygiene practices for target food processing companies \nand certification for a subset of these (targeting those keen on exporting); and (iv) improving food-\nborne illness response capacity, which will include selectively strengthening laboratory capacities \nwith upgraded microbial testing abilities to identify key microbiological risks such as salmonella. \nThe project will raise awareness and improve the implementation of food safety standards in the \nfood processing and tourist industries by promoting good hygiene practices, good manufacturing \npractices, and enterprise grading. \n \n2.  Output 2: Improved Regional Cooperation and Harmonization \n \n15.  The current project supports the participation of the Lao PDR in various bilateral working \ngroups and consultations on import handling, as well as national measures, in line with regional \nSPS requirements including those of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The project \nsupports the Lao PDR\u2019s effective participation in regional fora such as the Southeast Asia and \nChina Foot-and-Mouth Disease project; the International Food Safety Authorities Network; the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed; and twinning \narrangements between the Lao PDR and other countries in the region on SPS issues. Through \nimprovements  in  the  national  SPS  framework,  such  as  capacity  building  for  surveillance, \ninspection, monitoring, and data collection, the project facilitates the Lao PDR\u2019s participation and \ncontribution to regional SPS information exchange and cooperation on mutual recognition and \nharmonization of standards and regulations. The project will also continue to support SPS \ncooperation through bilateral working groups in plant health, animal health, and food safety.18  \n \n3.  Output 3: Enhanced Education Levels and University Training of Sanitary \nand Phytosanitary Specialists \n \n16.  The project will focus on upgrading academic education for SPS specialists at the Faculty \nof Agriculture at the National University of Laos. This will cover: (i) curricula updates following \ncurricula development provided in the current project, including harmonization in line with regional \n                                                \n17 Implementation will focus on provinces with international border posts and high levels of transit activity. \n18 This will include the establishment of new bilateral groups (e.g., on plant health between the Lao PDR and  \nViet Nam) where necessary.

ADB\u2019s \ntotal contribution will be $24 million, amounting to 96.9% of the total project cost. ADB will finance \nrecurrent costs to ensure smooth project implementation and longer-term capacity development. \nIn the original financing, the Government of the Lao PDR financed the equivalent of $0.46 million. \nFor the additional financing, the Government of the Lao PDR will finance the equivalent of $0.32 \nmillion to cover the costs of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Based on its positive project implementation track record, MAF\u2019s Department of Planning \nwill continue be the project executing agency, or project management unit (PMU). The PMU will \ncontinue to assume its role under the expanded project. The CIUs will also continue to oversee \ntheir respective outputs. The CIUs will be the Department of Agriculture, the Department of \nLivestock and Fisheries, the Food and Drugs Department, and the Faculty of Agriculture at the \nNational University of Laos. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual.21  \n \n20.  All procurement financed by the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Consultant recruitment will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Project implementation, procurement, and financial management will be \naligned  with  the  government\u2019s  standard  operating  procedures.  A  project  advance  account \nestablished at the Ministry of Finance, and a sub-account administered by the PMU, will be \nconsolidated and audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2020 (Grant closing date: 30 June 2021) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee chaired by MAF; members consist of CIU leads \n(ii)  Executing agency  MAF \n(iii)  Key implementing  Department of Agriculture; Department of Livestock and Fisheries; Food and \nagencies  Drugs Department; and Faculty of Agriculture (National University of Laos)   \n(iv) Implementation unit  PMU (8 staff), each component implementation unit (2\u20133 staff) \n    Lao PDR \nProcurement    National competitive  Multiple contracts ($2.964 million) \nbidding \nShopping   Multiple contracts ($0.098 million) \nDirect purchase  Multiple contracts ($0.089 million) \nConsulting services   Individual consultantsa  31 contracts; 98 person-months (international); \n186.0 person-months (national) ($2.274 million)  \n  Least-cost selection  2 contracts; 7.5 person-months (international); \nmethod  7.5 person-months (national) ($0.155 million) \n  Single source selection  5 contracts; 29.0 person-months (international); \n84.0 person-months (national) ($0.757 million) \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting of PMU project management and financial consultants \nin Q3\u2013Q4 2017 for the following positions: international project management \nand procurement advisor; national financial management specialist; national \nprocurement specialist; project administrative assistant; secretary. \n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  A key feature of the project technical design is to focus on the components dealing with \nplant health, animal health, food safety, and academic education for SPS capacity development \nin the Lao PDR. Despite the institutional breadth in each component, technical interventions are \nsimilar in focusing on strengthening surveillance and inspection systems, upgrading human \nresources, and involving the provision of a range of technical expertise, training, workshops, and \nhardware to achieve this purpose. The additional financing project design will continue to focus \non individual components (i.e., plant health, animal health, food safety, and education) to ensure \ncontinued progress in these aspects.  \n \n22.  The major technical design parameters are (i) a recognition that plant, animal, and food \nsafety surveillance systems start from a low information and human capacity base, and that \nenhancing SPS capacity should take a pragmatic and practical approach; (ii) promoting simple \nand cost-effective approaches where possible (e.g., the use of rapid test kits and construction of \nshared  laboratory  facilities);  and  (iii)  an  emphasis  on  strengthening  university  teaching  as \nopposed to research. The project has been designed to complement ongoing and planned \ninterventions by various development partners and ADB. Subregional cooperation is promoted \nthrough participation in regional SPS fora, bilateral working groups, information exchange, mutual \nrecognition of standards, training attachments, academic exchanges, and twinning arrangements.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The economic rationale for the project is that SPS services address market inadequacies \npertaining to public goods (including regional public goods), asymmetric information, negative \nexternalities, and coordination failures in protecting plant and animal health and ensuring food \nsafety. The project is expected to engender significant economic benefits, including an increase \nin the income of producers and exporters of AFF products as a result of lower SPS-related trade \nbarriers, an increase in farmers\u2019 incomes owing to higher crop yields, a decrease in farmers\u2019 \nlosses from animal diseases, a reduction of the country\u2019s economic losses resulting from food-\nborne diseases, and an increase in domestic income generated by tourism. With an economic \ninternal rate of return of 11.5% and a considerable positive impact on government revenue, the \nproject is economically justifiable and financially sustainable.22  \n \nC.  Governance  \n \n24.  The financial management assessment concluded that the overall fiduciary risk in the \nLao PDR is moderate. This assessment is based on concerns regarding: (i) transparency in the \nuse of public finances with limited public access to government budget and financial information;  \n(ii) low awareness of modern internal controls in the public sector; and (iii) weak government \n                                                \n22 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \noversight and the slow pace of reform. The assessment recommended that detailed consolidated \nannual project financial statements be audited  in accordance with international standards on \nauditing by an auditor acceptable to ADB, such as the State Audit Organisation of the Lao PDR. \nThe PMU will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly project progress reports, which will include:  \n(i) a narrative description of physical and financial progress made during the reporting period;  \n(ii)  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule;  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered;  and  \n(iv) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period.   \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manuals (footnote 19).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  The project will increase trade in the Lao PDR\u2019s AFF products as their safety improves \nand they gain acceptance in foreign markets. Improved SPS handling of AFF products will \nenhance agricultural productivity, making AFF trade more predictable and lowering transaction \ncosts. This should lower consumer prices in markets, contributing to improved living standards \nand increased competitiveness of the Lao PDR. An improved surveillance and outbreak response \nto livestock diseases will benefit rural households, as animal mortality will be reduced. Improved \nnational food surveillance reduces exposure to illness and time off work for all, including the poor. \nRegarding tourism, grading will stabilize and formalize food establishments, indirectly sustaining \nthe employment of workers in food preparation and serving. The grading visits and audits of \nnational food safety surveillance systems will also generate formal employment.  \n \n27.  The current project is categorized as having some gender benefits, and the additional \nfinancing will align with this. Gender analysis was conducted during project preparation, and \ntargets on women\u2019s participation in training were included in the project design and monitoring \nframework  and  loan  covenants.  Sex-disaggregated  data  collection  was  integrated  into  the \nproject\u2019s monitoring and evaluation system. Gender targets have been met under the current \nproject. As of 31 August 2017, 370 (56%) out of 660 participants of training in food safety handling \nand good manufacturing practice were females (target 30%), 40% of participants in SPS training \nwere females (target 30%), and more than 50% of PMU and CIU staff are women (target 30%). \nAs women dominate agricultural employment in the Lao PDR23 and their participation in tourist-\nrelated employment is high, they will particularly benefit from additional project investments. \nSelected gender targets, such as women\u2019s participation in training and the ratio of female staff in \nthe PMU, have been identified and reflected in the design and monitoring framework.24  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  The  resettlement,  environmental  assessment  and  review,  and  indigenous  peoples \nplanning frameworks  agreed  by  the government  and  ADB  were  updated  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). Compliance with safeguard policy and gender requirements \nof the current project is satisfactory. During project implementation, no negative environmental, \nresettlement, or indigenous peoples impacts were encountered as a result of project activities. \nGiven  the  small  scale  and  location  of  the  proposed  civil  works,  minimal  impacts  during \nconstruction are anticipated, and these can be dealt with by adhering to national environmental, \nhealth, and safety regulations. The additional financing project is classified category C for impacts \non the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n                                                \n23 Women account for over 50% of workers engaged in agriculture in the Lao PDR. \n 24 The target identification draws from the results and data collected under the current project. ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and management plan.25 The overall risk of the project is moderate, with \nmitigating measures.  The project will strengthen staff capacity in financial management to allow \nefficient accounting and reporting of financial performance. It will establish or use existing \nministerial websites to: (i) disclose project progress, bid notifications, and their results; and (ii) \nprovide a grievance mechanism for corrupt practices.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nPublic financial management.   The government has made assurances that it will allocate annual \nLack of sustainability of project  budgetary resources to cover recurrent costs related to the \nachievements after completion  operation and maintenance of the surveillance, inspection, and \nowing to insufficient government  monitoring systems for plant health, animal health, and food \nbudget allocation to operations  safety.

ASSURANCES  \n \n30.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual and grant documents. \n \n31.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the grant agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n32.
