I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the additional financing of the Nam \nNgum River Basin Development Sector Project.1  \n \n2.  Water is the most vital natural resource in the Lao PDR as its sustainable management \nis  indispensable  for  agriculture,  energy,  and  mining  sectors.  These  sectors  are  critical  for \ndelivering an annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of about 8% during the 2011\u2013\n2015 period. The government deems this rate of economic growth necessary for the country to \ngraduate  from  least  developed  country  status  by  2020  as  well  as  to  achieve  its  poverty \nreduction targets. The water resources also have regional significance since about 35% of total \nMekong river flow is generated in the country\u2019s watersheds. The country has abundant water \nresources per capita.2 However, current storage capacity of large reservoirs is about 3% of \nannual surface water availability and hydropower generation is about 8% of potential. With the \nsecond largest annual flow and population, the Nam Ngum River Basin (NNRB) is one of the \nmost  important  river  basins  in  the  Lao  PDR  where  water  resources  have  been  utilized \nsignificantly for hydropower generation and irrigation. The current project promotes optimal use \nof water resources through integrated water resources management (IWRM)3 in the NNRB, \nwhich  includes  16  districts  in  Luangprabang,  Vientiane,  and  Xiengkhouang  provinces,  and \nVientiane Capital. To date, the current project has contributed significantly to improved water \ngovernance, information gathering and processing, and watershed management both within the \nNNRB  and  nationally.  The  additional  financing  will  consolidate  and  enhance  these \nachievements.  \nII.  THE PROJECT \n   \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Nam Ngum River Basin \nDevelopment  Sector  Project4 for  $15 million  equivalent from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF). The closing date is 30 September 2011 following three extensions.5 The project was \ndesigned to institutionalize IWRM in the water sector planning and management at the central \nand provincial levels, and to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for poor and ethnic \npeople. It has three investment components: IWRM, reservoir modeling and management, and \nwatershed management. The current project has (i) contributed to the establishment of the \nWater Resources and Environment Administration (WREA),6 (ii) developed the national water \nresources profile and NNRB plan7 which is the country\u2019s first IWRM plan, (iii) supported the \n                                                \n1 The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2\nThe total actual renewable water resources per capita is about 58,000 cubic meter per year, which is the highest   \namong Southeast Asian countries. http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/maps \n3 IWRM is a process to improve the planning, conservation, development, and management of water, forest, land, \nand aquatic resources in a river basin context, to maximize economic benefits and social welfare in an equitable \nmanner without compromising the sustainability of vital environmental systems. (ADB. 2001. Water for All. Manila.)  \n4 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Nam Ngum River Basin Development Sector Project. Manila (approved on 11 \nNovember 2002). \n5 There were initial delays of 15 months in loan effectiveness and 4 months in consultant recruitment, but the overall \nproject implementation period from effectiveness to completion remained at about 80 months (6 years and 8 \nmonths). This led to two initial extensions. The physical completion date is 30 September 2010.  The third extension, \nfor 6 months, is to examine the government\u2019s request for this additional financing (para. 6). \n6 WREA was  established  under  the  Decree  No.  149/PM  on  10  May  2007.  Originally,  the Water  Resources \nCoordination  Committee  was  the  implementing  agency  for  the  IWRM  component.  WREA  superseded  the \ncoordination committee as the implementing agency and was subsumed under the Ministry of Natural Resources \nand Environment (MoNRE) which was newly established in June 2011. \n7 WREA. 2009. Nam Ngum River Basin Integrated Water Resources Management Plan. Vientiane. ", "2   \ngovernment  in  developing  and  adopting  a  decree  for  general  establishment  of  river  basin \ncommittees 8  which  has  enabled  the  establishment  of  two  river  basin  committees,  (iv) \nstrengthened the capacity of the Department of Electricity of the Ministry of Energy and Mines \nfor  Nam  Ngum  1  reservoir9 management,  (v)  developed  the  capacity  of  the  Integrated \nWatershed Management Unit (IWMU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), and (vi) \ninitiated decentralized agricultural support systems.   \n \n4.  The current project is considered to be performing well according to ADB\u2019s additional \nfinancing policy.10 In March 2011, an early project completion review mission was conducted by \nADB to coincide with the final review of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD),11 a \ncofinancier  of  the  current  project.  The  project  completion  review  mission  concluded  that, \nalthough  there  were  start-up  delays  and  a  need  to  reformulate  the  agricultural  extension \nactivities,12 the  current  project  has  been  successful  in  achieving  its  overall  development \nobjectives. The review mission reported that major output indicators exceeded their targets and \nkey outcome targets were achieved.13 The cumulative physical progress reached 98%. Planned \ncontracts were fully awarded and $17.38 million was disbursed out of the total allocation of \n$17.39 million from the ADF. The rate of contract awards and disbursements showed much-\nimproved performance in later years of implementation. The mission identified no major issues \nand noted that the applicable safeguards policies were complied with throughout the project \nimplementation. No major risks threatened the successful implementation of the project and it is \nrated on-track in the project performance rating.  \n \n5.  In particular, the current loan has successfully implemented the IWRM process in the \nNNRB by (i) supporting the establishment of the Nam Ngum River Basin Committee Secretariat \n(NNRBCS)  and  initial  operations  of  the  WREA,  (ii)  initiating  the  process  of  watershed \nmanagement planning within IWMU, (iii) setting up 29 khet (village cluster) extension service \ncenters (KESCs) for improved farming practices under the Lao Extension Approach, and (iv) \ninitiating village development revolving funds (VDRFs) with detailed operational guidelines in the \n16 districts. In addition to these institutional developments, the current project provided about \n12,000 households with improved agricultural support services and more than 9,000 households \nhad access to credits for agricultural inputs and materials. Sample surveys under the project \nshow an average household income increase of 54% from 2004 to 2009. Average rice yields \nincreased from 3.1 tons per hectare (t/ha) in 2004 to 3.6 t/ha in 2009 in 158 villages surveyed. \nTotal number of livestock in the villages increased by about 40% from 2004 to 2009.14 However, \nsustainability of some of these outputs and their impacts are uncertain since these activities \nhave been in place for a short period coupled with the government constraints in providing \nsufficient human and financial resources to fully operationalize the new institutions. Key lessons \n                                                \n8 Decree No. 293/PM on 15 June 2010. \n9 The Nam Ngum 1 reservoir is the largest reservoir in the country with a total storage capacity of almost 7,300 \nmillion cubic meter and an electricity generation capacity of 155 megawatt, generating approximately 966 gigawatt-\nhours per annum. The Nam Ngum 1 dam was completed in 1971.  \n10 ADB. 2010. Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila. Para. 41 of the policy paper \ndescribes measures to determine whether a project is performing well: (i) the delivery of expected outputs, (ii) \nsatisfactory  implementation  progress,  (iii)  satisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements,  (iv) \nsuccessful management of risks, and (v) a rating of highly satisfactory or satisfactory in the project performance \nratings. The required ratings are substituted with an on-track rating under the revised performance rating system. \n11 The AFD grant was approved by AFD\u2019s board on 24 April 2003, became effective in July 2003 and closed on 31 \nMay 2009. AFD\u2019s final independent evaluation mission was required to be conducted within 24 months of AFD\u2019s \ngrant closing date. \n12 The reformulation followed the then newly developed Lao Extension Approach in 2005. The approach consists of \ntwo sub-systems: the government extension services and the village extension system. The village system is jointly \nmanaged by villagers and village authorities. Activities are facilitated by village extension workers who are \nappointed and compensated by the community, while receiving technical support from government services. \n13 Summary of Project  Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Survey results are in the Summary of Project Performance (footnote 13). \n ", "3 \nlearned include: (i) retaining experienced staff and strategic asset management consolidate \nKESC  operations,  and  (ii)  formalizing  VDRF  operations  under  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR \nmicrofinance regulations improves their sustainability. The government also intends to initiate \nsub-basin management to address location-specific water-related issues through the process of \nsub-basin planning and monitoring. \n \n6.  Consequently,  the  government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  consideration  of  additional \nfinancing  to  consolidate  and  expand  the  activities  initiated  under  the  current  project.15 In \nresponse to the request, the proposed additional financing project will modify and scale-up the \nwell-performing  operations,  particularly  participatory  sub-basin  management  to  strengthen \nIWRM  capacity  at  the district  level,  consolidate  KESC  and  VDRF  operations,  and  expand \npromising agricultural support services to benefit additional villages in remote parts of the NNRB. \n \n7.  The  additional  financing  project  meets  ADB\u2019s  four  eligibility  criteria  for  additional \nfinancing:16 (i) the satisfactory implementation and performance of the current project (confirmed \nby the project completion review mission) supports technical, financial, and economic viability of \nthe  additional  financing  project  as  it  will  have  no  significant  changes  in  approaches  and \nmethodologies from the current project; (ii) the government accords the additional financing \nproject high priority through its request for additional financing; (iii) while project outputs will be \nscaled up and replicated in additional villages within the basin, the project retains the original \noverall objectives;17 and (iv) the outcome is consistent with the current country strategy and \nprogram midterm review (2009),18 which promotes natural and water resources management for \nsustainable economic growth. \n \n8.  The additional financing project has a high degree of project readiness. The capacity of \nthe MAF (the executing agency) has significantly improved over the course of the current project \nimplementation. Under the project, practical plans have been developed for self-sustaining \nKESC and VDRF operations based on experiences gained and lessons learned. Additional \nfinancing is considered to be a suitable instrument to promptly respond to the emerging needs \nand deepen the achievements of the current project. Building on the established arrangements \nand methodologies, the additional financing project will capture incremental poverty reduction \nand sustainable natural resources management benefits from the strengthened public sector \ninstitutions and communities for IWRM in the NNRB. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected impact of the overall project will be the optimal use of water resources,19 \nespecially within the NNRB. The outcome will be integrated watershed management improved \nin  the  NNRB.  The  additional  financing  project  will  ensure  that  significant  institutional \ndevelopments under the current project are embedded in central and local government as well \nas  water  and  natural  resources  management  systems.  Enhanced  district  and  community \nparticipation  and  interagency  coordination  will  facilitate  synergy  between  sub-basin \n                                                \n15 In accordance with ADB\u2019s additional financing policy (footnote 10). Para. 40 describes that additional financing will \nsupport scale up of operations and scope changes or modifications of projects that are performing well.   \n16 As per para. 4 of the Operations Manual (OM) Section H5/BP, additional financing will only support projects that (i) \nremain technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) are accorded high priority by the \ngovernment; (iii) are consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) are consistent with the current \ncountry partnership strategy. This follows para. 40 of ADB\u2019s additional financing policy (footnote 10), \n17 The original goal is now the impact and the original objective is now the outcome. The original two outcomes are \ncombined into one. The components under the current project are outputs under the additional financing project. \n18 ADB. 2009. Country Strategy and Program Midterm Review: Lao PDR, 2007\u20132011. Manila. \n19 The optimal use of water resources under the additional financing project envisions the sustainability of water- and \nland-based natural resources, which can partly be captured through observation of river flows. The goal of the \ngovernment\u2019s NNRB plan aims also to facilitate the sustainable use of the water and related resources. \n ", "4   \nmanagement and livelihood support services. These are necessary for effective IWRM within \nthe NNRB. The reservoir management and modeling activities of the current project will not be \ncontinued  as  these  activities  have  been  completed.  The  additional  financing  project  will, \nhowever, continue to monitor the reservoir modeling results. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  Expected outputs will be (i) the NNRBCS strengthened for sub-basin management, (ii) \ndistrict  land  use  planning  enhanced,  (iii)  agricultural  support  services  improved,  and  (iv) \ninstitutional  and  human  resource  capacity  strengthened  for  project  implementation.  The \nNNRBCS will initiate its operations for developing sub-basin plans to facilitate coordinated sub-\nbasin management at the district level. Improved watershed planning will be incorporated in \ndistrict land use plans to align local development programs with sustainable sub-basin and \nwatershed management. Enhanced agricultural support services will promote the adoption of \nenvironmentally sustainable and profitable farming and forestry practices. \n  \n11.  Output 1: NNRBCS strengthened for sub-basin management. The project activities \nwill assist the newly established NNRBCS in initiating sub-basin management. These activities \nwill include (i) selecting five priority sub-basins; (ii) undertaking multi-stakeholder consultations \nfor sub-basin planning and monitoring in the selected sub-basins; (iii) establishing a working \ngroup for each of the priority sub-basins; (iv) training on sub-basin management; (v) developing \nand  disseminating  sub-basin  management  plans;  and  (vi)  developing  guidelines  for  the \nimplementation and monitoring of the plans. The sub-basin plans will identify specific sub-basin \nissues to be addressed through a decentralized consultation process with beneficiaries. The key \nelements of these plans will be incorporated into district development plans. \n \n12.  Output 2: District land use planning enhanced. The project will assist in incorporating \nwatershed landscape continuum plans (WLCPs)20 developed under the current project in district \ndevelopment  programs.  The  planned  activities  will  (i)  disseminate WLCPs  to  communities \nthrough the village development planning process, (ii) train district staff in preparing and/or \nrevising district land use zoning in accordance with the WLCPs to promote environmentally \nsustainable land use, and (iii) update WLCPs based on the development process of district land \nuse plans and sub-basin management plans. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Agricultural  support  services  improved.  The  project  will  assist  in \nenhancing KESC operational capacity and sustainability, and increasing their beneficiaries. \nIntensive support will be provided to 23 KESCs in 10 districts21 within the NNRB which are \nrelatively poor and remote. The KESCs will cover 230 villages, which have been supported \nunder the current project, and 50 additional villages. The project will transform existing VDRFs \nin 16 districts into sustainable financing institutions. The activities will (i) strengthen KESC \ncapacity for the effective management of the centers by improving technical skills of staff, (ii) \ntrain farmer leaders and foster their networks, (iii) implement extension services with income-\ngenerating  activities  such  as  seed  and  seedling  production  and  cattle  fattening,  and  (iv) \ninstitutionalize  the  VDRFs  as  district  savings and  credit  unions  or  other  appropriate  credit \ninstitutions by registering under the Bank of Lao PDR. The main aim of these activities is to \nenhance  sustainability  of  KESC  and  VDRF  operations  through  improved  efficiency,  staff \n                                                \n20 WLCPs were developed for improved and coordinated watershed management. While sub-basin management \nunder output 1 will focus on water-based natural resources such as quantity and quality of river flows and riverine \necosystems, WLCPs provide guidance for land use planning at the district and village levels with site-specific \nenvironmental information and coordinated zoning. \n21 Hinheup, Hom, Kasy, Pek, Phaxay, Phonhong, Phoukhoune, Phoukout, Vang Vieng, and Xaysomboum districts. \nThe project will monitor and provide minimal support to six KESCs (86 villages) within the other six districts. \n ", "5 \nincentives,  and  income  sources.  Farmers\u2019  involvement  will  also  be  increased  to  reduce \noperational costs for these institutions. \n \n14.  Output  4:  Institutional  and  human  resource  capacity  strengthened  for  project \nimplementation.  The  additional  financing  project  will  increase  project  implementation  and \nnatural resources management capacity of NNRB staff to intensify interagency coordination and \nenhance district and community participation. The project will (i) support coordination across \noutputs; (ii) facilitate cross-sector information sharing on natural resources management such \nas hydro-meteorological data, watershed profiling, and consultation and training programs for \nlocal governments and communities; and (iii) initiate formalized planning and review processes. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n15.  The additional financing project is estimated to cost $5.08 million (Table 1). As of July \n2011, the cost of the current project was $29.06 million equivalent,22 reflecting higher than \nestimated  in-kind  contributions  by  the  government  and  increased  funds  availability  due  to \nappreciation  of  the  special  drawing  right.  The  overall  project  with  additional  financing  is \nestimated to cost $34.14 million. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n  Amounta \nOriginal  Additional \nItem    Project  Financing  Total \nA.

This is justified because (i) it will not represent an \nexcessive share of the project investment plan, (ii) taxes and duties apply only with respect to ADB-financed \nexpenditures, and (iii) financing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the \nadditional financing project. The ADB loan may finance transportation and insurance costs related to \nadditional financing project expenditures. \nPb  In mid-2011 prices for additional financing. The integrated water resources management component of the \ncurrent project refers to output 1 of the additional financing project. The watershed management component \nof the current project refers to outputs 2 and 3 of the additional financing project. The capacity development \nrefers to output 4 of the additional financing project. \nc  The cost of the current project under this item was for project management.  \nPd For additional financing, physical contingencies are computed at 5% for civil works, and vehicles and \nequipment; and 0% for consulting services. Price contingencies computed at 2.4% on foreign exchange \ncosts and 4.5% on local currency costs include provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under the \nassumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \nPe   Interest during implementation under Asian Development Fund regular terms is computed at 1.0% during  \n    the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n Source: ADB estimates. \n \n                                                \n22 The current project cost was initially estimated at $23 million equivalent, financed by an Asian Development Fund \nloan of $15 million equivalent (denominated in special drawing rights) and a parallel grant of $3.8 million equivalent \nfrom AFD, with the government to finance the balance of $4.2 million equivalent.  \n ", "6   \n16.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR3,119,000 \n($5 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the  additional \nfinancing project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement.

The financing plan is in Table 2. For the additional financing project, the government will \nfinance about $0.08 million equivalent in kind for its staff salaries and office space. Parallel \ncofinancing  from  AFD  was  concluded  for  the  original  IWRM  component,  and  no  further \ncofinancing is required for the additional financing project. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n   \n  Original Project  Additional Financing  Total \nActual       \nAmountb  Share of  Amount  Share of  Amount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%) \nADF loan  17.39    59.84    5.00    98.43    22.39     65.58 \nAFD granta    5.25    18.07    0.00       0.00      5.25  15.38 \nGovernment    6.42    22.09    0.08       1.57      6.50  19.04 \nTotal  29.06  100.00    5.08   100.00    34.14  100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, AFD = Agence Francaise de Developpement. \na Not administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nb As of July 2011. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  described  in  detail  in  Table  3.  The  existing \narrangements for the current project will be retained with minor adjustments to further facilitate \nvillage level activities as stated in this paragraph. The MAF will continue to be the executing \nagency,  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  MoNRE  (through  the  NNRBCS),24 IWMU, \nNational  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Extension  Service,  and  Office  of  the  National  Project \nManager  (ONPM)  of  the  MAF.  The  current  project  steering  committee  will  provide  overall \nguidance for the project implementation. The ONPM will continue to provide overall coordination \namong the  additional financing  project  outputs. Other  existing  organizations,  which  will  be \nretained for the project implementation, are as follows: (i) provincial project facilitators within the \nprovincial  agriculture  and  forestry  offices  in  Vientiane  and  Xiengkhouang  provinces  for \ncoordination between districts, and (ii) district implementation units within 10 district agricultural \nand forestry offices in Luangprabang, Vientiane, and Xiengkhouang provinces under district \nsteering committees. The project staff in each district will include an environment officer and a \nsocial safeguard officer.25 \n \n                                                \n23 The category includes VDRFs, capacity building and infrastructure funds for rural infrastructure and village \ncommon assets, and demonstration materials and supplies for community mobilization. \n24 Footnote 6. \n25 District steering committees will coordinate project activities within the respective district governments, including \nthe  assignment  of  staff  with  special  expertise  such  as  environment  and  social  safeguards  to  the  district \nimplementation units, as required. \n ", "7 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2012\u2013February 2015 \nEstimated completion date  February 2015 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee \nVice-minister of MAF (chair); senior staff at the director general level \nfrom  the  MAF,  MoNRE,  MOF,  MPI,  LWU,  and  LFNC,  and  vice-\ngovernors representing NNRBC (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  MAF through ONPM of DOP \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MoNRE through NNRBCS for output 1, IWMU for output 2, NAFES for \noutput 3, and ONPM for output 4 \n(iv)  Implementation unit  ONPM (6 staff), NNRBCS (5 staff), IWMU (5 staff), NAFES (21 staff), \nand 10 DAFOs (10 each) \nProcurementa  Shopping/Community  Multiple contracts  $1,549,000 \nContracting \nConsulting services  CQS  Multiple contracts  $ 50,000 \nIndividual consultants  161 person-months  $ 693,000 \nRetroactive financing and  Retroactive financing, if approved, will apply to expenditures incurred \nadvance contracting  prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before signing \nof the loan agreement subject to a maximum amount of $80,000. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants qualifications selection, DAFO = District Agriculture and Forestry \nOffice, DOP = Department of Planning, IWMU = Integrated Watershed Management Unit, LFNC = Lao Front for National \nConstruction, LWU = Lao Women\u2019s Union, MAF = Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, MoNRE = Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MPI = Ministry of Planning and Investment, NAFES = National \nAgriculture and Forestry Extension Service, NNRBC = Nam Ngum River Basin Committee, NNRBCS = Nam Ngum \nRiver Basin Committee Secretariat, ONPM = Office of National Project Manager.  \na All procurement will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) and all engagement of consultants shall be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time).

The nature of the additional financing project impacts will be similar to that of the current \nproject, following similar village selection procedure and methodologies established under the \ncurrent project. Therefore, technical feasibility, economic benefits, financial viability, and project \nsustainability  for  the  proposed  investments  were  analyzed  based  on  the  demonstrated \nperformance of the current project.  \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n20.  The additional financing project, like the current project, will adopt a sector approach to \nallow  for  decentralized  and  participatory  project  implementation.  Additional  villages  will  be \nscreened and selected during implementation following a set of criteria developed under the \ncurrent project. The current project has developed a participatory village development and land \nuse  planning  process  which  has  been  accepted  by  villagers.  This  facilitates  community \nparticipation and coordination among project stakeholders. Major livelihood activities proposed \nunder the additional financing project have proved to be implementable in the local context. \nThese activities include improved rice cropping, livestock-raising, and nontimber forest product \nmanagement. The project will follow programs and guidelines for KESC and VDRF operations \nprepared under the current project. The additional financing project will utilize and build on these \n ", "8   \nestablished approaches as they have been proven to be operationally sound and technically \nfeasible. Therefore, if properly and efficiently implemented, the achievement of the project \noutcome and outputs should face no serious risks. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The  benefits  of  the  current  project  were  verified  by  the  project  completion  review \nmission. Benefits that were readily quantifiable include incremental benefits from increased farm \nand  forestry  productivity  through  integrated  agriculture  extension  and  enhanced  watershed \nmanagement.  A  sample  survey  shows  increased  rice  yields,  livestock  productivity,  and \nhousehold income. The project completion review mission estimated that the economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of the current project is 25.8%.26 The benefits of the additional financing \nproject will be (i) effective sub-basin management, (ii) sustainable agriculture support services, \nand (iii) increased rice and livestock production and livelihood opportunities from sustainable \nand improved natural resources productivity, forest and water in particular. The EIRR of the \nadditional financing project is estimated at 28.7% based on major quantifiable benefits from \nincreased productivity in rice, livestock, and forestry. This compares well with that of the current \nproject which includes benefits from improved hydropower generation. The additional financing \nproject is viable, relying on proven activities of the current project. The EIRR of the overall \nproject is estimated at 27.4%. This demonstrates that the additional financing project will add \nsignificant economic value to the benefits realized under the current project. \n   \n22.  Through the implementation of the current project, the proposed executing agency and \nimplementing agencies have demonstrated their capacity to implement the current project. The \nprocurement  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  was  assessed  to  be  acceptable  during \npreparation  of  the  additional  financing  project.  Project  staff  in  the  ONPM  have  also \ndemonstrated sufficient financial management capacity to implement the additional financing \nproject. The fund flow mechanism  has  been  refined through  experience gained  under  the \ncurrent project. Experienced staff will be retained and external technical support will further \nimprove the financial management and procurement of the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  for  the  additional  financing  project  activities.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual.27 The additional financing project will assist with decentralized project implementation \nby district governments. Promoting involvement of local communities is expected to increase \ntransparency of project-related decision making and accountability of the public sector. External \nspecialists in financial management, procurement and environmental and social safeguards will \nbe engaged by the ONPM to support project staff. Representatives from the Lao Front for \nNational Construction (LFNC) and the Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) will continue to support \nproject activities in the field through supervision. This will improve project-related governance.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  The  additional  financing  project  will  focus  on  communities  in  upland  areas  where \nsignificant numbers of ethnic people live and where poor people depend almost solely on \nfarming and forestry for their livelihoods. The selection procedure will target villages with higher \npoverty levels and ethnic population ratios to enhance the positive social impact of the project. \n                                                \n26 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Project Administration Manual  (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nParticipatory village development and land use planning will promote inclusive, gender, and \nethnic group sensitive development and resources allocation. Improved watershed management \nwill promote sustainable natural resources use, which improves food security for the poorest. \nThe current project has improved the access of women to rural credits through VDRFs and to \nclean water through improved water supply systems. These activities were well appreciated by \nfemale villagers and will be continued under the additional financing project.28 The key gender \ndesign features are (i) at least 30% female participation in training sessions for government staff \nand villagers; and (ii) promotion of joint land use certificates issued in the names of both \nhusband and wife, to support women\u2019s access to land.    \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  Environmental  safeguard  (category  B).  The  additional  financing  project  will  have \nlimited site-specific environmental and social impacts. The current project has had no significant \nadverse  environmental  and  social  impact.  Initial  environmental  examinations  for  19 \nsubwatersheds within the NNRB were prepared under the  current project.29 The additional \nfinancing project will continue to support livelihood activities initiated under the current project in \n230 villages and initiate similar activities in 50 additional villages in the same subwatersheds. \nFollowing the procedures set forth in the environmental assessment and review framework,30 a \nscreening process will be established to categorize the activities of each target village according \nto its environmental sensitivity and, where needed, existing initial environmental examinations \nand environmental management plans will be updated to address site-specific issues consistent \nwith  government  requirements  and  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  closely  monitored  based  on  the  environmental  management  plans.  An \nenvironmental safeguard specialist will assist project staff in complying with the requirements \nand monitoring these procedures. \n \n26.  Involuntary resettlement (category C) and indigenous peoples (category B). The \nadditional financing project activities will not involve any involuntary acquisition of land or other \nassets. Community-based small-scale infrastructure will, in principle, be designed on existing \nrights-of-way or public land. Any acquisition of land and other assets will be based on voluntary \ncontribution. The procedural guidelines for voluntary land contribution have been prepared.31 \nEthnic  people  will  benefit  from  the  project  through  increased  agricultural  and  forestry \nproductivity and improved access to infrastructure and credits for better livelihood opportunities. \nParticipatory  village  development  planning,  supplemented  by  focus  group  discussions,  will \nfacilitate the participation of ethnic people in project activities in a socially acceptable manner. A \nsocial safeguard specialist, in collaboration with representatives of the LFNC and LWU, will \nassist project staff to comply with the requirements and to monitor the procedures. \n   \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  Key risks and mitigating measures32 are summarized in Table 4. The integrated benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n \n                                                \n28 Gender categorization for this project is effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action plan is accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2. The plan will ensure that women have full and equitable access to the \nadditional financing project\u2019s resources and benefits. \n29 Nineteen initial environmental examinations were approved by the Science Technology and Environment Agency. \n30 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Procedural Guidelines for Voluntary Land Contribution (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \n  Table 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited capacity at the  (i) Well-trained staff from the current project will mentor and support the district level \ndistrict level to meet project  staff, and (ii) loan implementation support consultants will train and support project staff \nimplementation requirements  through on-the-job training and monitor implementation procedures and status. \nLack of operation and  Civil works will be designed considering the capacity of the community to manage.

ASSURANCES \n \n28.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n29.  The  government  has  assured  that  no  civil  works  contract  will  be  awarded  until  (i) \nrelevant provisions from the environmental management plan have been incorporated into the \ncivil works contract, (ii) the said civil works contract is screened to ensure that it does not \ninvolve involuntary resettlement impacts, and (iii) the final ethnic groups development plan is \nprepared by the government and cleared by ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR3,119,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the \nadditional financing of the Nam Ngum River Basin Development Sector Project from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n2 September 2011 \n ", " \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nPerformance Targets  Performance Targets  Data Sources \nAssumptions and \nDesign Summary  Design Summary  and Indicators with  and Indicators with  and Reporting \nRisks \n(Current Project)  (Overall Project)  Baselines  Baselinesb  Mechanisms \n(Overall Project) \n(Current Project)a  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact          Assumption \nOptimal use of water  (unchanged)  Mean annual discharge in  By 2018, seasonal  Annual reports on  High-level government \nresources, especially in  and out of Nam Ngum  discharges in Nam Ngum  discharge data by  support for integrated \nthe Nam Ngum River  reservoir better managed  River better managedc  the Ministry of  water resources \nBasin (NNRB)  (changed)   Natural Resources  management (IWRM) \nand Environment \n(MoNRE) \nOutcome          Assumptions \nIWRM implemented in  Integrated  IWRM adopted and reflected   (unchanged)  Quarterly project  IWRM retained as a \nNNRB  watershed  in the National 2006\u20132010    progress and final  priority in SEDP (2011\u2013\n  management  Five-Year Socioeconomic    reports  2015) \nSustainable livelihood  improved in NNRB  Development Plan (SEDP)       \nopportunities provided to  (combined)  (achieved)    Bi-annual project  District governments are \nupland poor and ethnic      review missions  willing to adopt a sub-\ngroups  Effective coordination  By 2015, district development     basin management \n  among water user agencies  plans d  updated to  Development plans  concept \nestablished by 2008  incorporate sub-basin  of target districts   \n(achieved)  management concept    Commodity prices are \n  (added)  Adoptees\u2019 sample  stable to maintain \n    survey by districts   improved income \nIncome of about 10,000  By 2015, average income of     \nhouseholds increased by  beneficiary households  Risk \n60%\u201380% (by 2011)  increased by 60% from 2012  Economic conditions \n(achieved)  levels in 50 additional villages  change villagers\u2019 \n(added)  priorities and incentives \nOutputs \nIWRM  \n1.
