INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide advisory support to the \nRepublic of Tajikistan for updating the current transport sector development program (National \nTarget Development Program for the Transport Sector of the Republic of Tajikistan up to 2025)1 \nand  for  formulating  a  transport  sector  capacity  development  program.  The  updated  sector \ndevelopment program will set the direction for the country\u2019s transport sector during 2026\u20132040, \nwhile the newly formulated capacity development program will enable the government to manage \nsector planning in a self-sustainable manner.2 The TA is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2021\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Tajikistan.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB has provided assistance to Tajikistan's transport sector since the late 1990s, largely \nfor the road subsector, in accordance with the current sector development program (footnote 1). \nThis combined physical investments and TA support. The physical investments helped improve \nmajor international and national roads, while TA activities supported sector planning, road safety, \nand asset management and maintenance. The outputs were achieved almost as originally \ndesigned, but it remains a challenge to institutionalize them in a sustainable manner.4 \n \n3.  In 2007\u20132008, ADB provided TA to the government to draft a master plan on which the \ncurrent sector development program is based (footnote 1). That TA yielded various lessons, such \nas the need for fostering the leadership of the Ministry of Transport (MOT) in implementing the \nprogram and for improving the sector\u2019s planning and monitoring function to ensure the proper \nimplementation of the program.5 These lessons were also confirmed by ADB\u2019s recent transport \nsector assessment of Tajikistan.6  \n \n4.  Limited coordination on investments. The MOT is the primary body responsible for \nplanning  the  country\u2019s  transport  sector  and  the  road  subsector.  However,  other  subsector \nagencies\u2014Tajikistan  Railway  for  rail  transport,  Civil  Aviation  Agency  for  air  transport,  and \nCustoms Services for cross-border and logistics facilitation\u2014have their own planning functions, \nand their plans are not well aligned with the MOT\u2019s overall plan. This fragmentation hampers \npotential synergies and rather generates competition between the subsectors. \n \n5.  The  fragmentation  in  planning  also  manifests  itself  in  geographically  unbalanced \ndevelopment. Investments have been concentrated along the country\u2019s arterial corridors, which \ntraverse it from north to south and mainly through roads. Other regions and subsectors received \nfar less investment and remained underdeveloped. This unbalanced development is considered \none of the main causes of the widening economic disparities in the country.7  \n \n \n1  Government of Tajikistan. 2011.

The transport sector has received assistance \nof about $2.6 billion from development partners since the late 1990s, which contributed to the \nsubstantial development of physical transport assets. Sustaining the quality of the assets created \nis a growing challenge. The country\u2019s severe climatic conditions are found to contribute to the \ndeterioration of transport assets, since the roads and associated structures, as designed, are not \nnecessarily tolerant of such severity. Related to this, a recent study explains the possibility that \nclimate change in the country could transform the patterns of disasters and increase their \nlikelihood, creating an even higher risk of road network deterioration and the resulting adverse \nimpacts on traffic, people\u2019s livelihoods and mobility, and regional economic platforms.8 This \nimplies an immediate need to establish a robust asset management system by integrating climate-\nresilient features. The government recognizes these challenges and currently works on the \ndevelopment of the road asset management system in coordination with development partners.9 \n \n7.  Insufficient institutional resources. Despite the changes that the transport sector has \nfaced, no commensurate levels of change took place in the sector\u2019s institutional and operational \narrangements  since  Tajikistan\u2019s  independence  in  1991.  These  gaps  cause  operational \ninefficiencies and make it difficult to sustain the quality of the assets developed, and this can only \nbe rectified by revisiting the institutional setup and strengthening the capacity in a way that is \nresponsive to the country\u2019s actual needs for the sector. \n \n8.  Changes in relationships with neighboring countries. Central Asia has gone through \nmajor geopolitical changes since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Tajikistan\u2019s trade patterns \nas well as people\u2019s individual travel behaviors have been affected by events such as (i) the \nrecently improved diplomatic ties with Uzbekistan, and (ii) ongoing instability in Afghanistan.10 \nThese developments highlight the need to redefine the functions of the country\u2019s existing transport \nnetwork. \n \n9.  Need for coordinated planning. The country\u2019s National Development Strategy names \nthe transport sector as a key contributor to economic development and poverty reduction.11 \nHowever, the issues discussed in paras. 4\u20137 undermine the transport sector. For the sector to \nperform as expected, it needs to be further developed in a way that reflects the development \nneeds of the country as well as new travel and trade patterns under the broader regional context \n(para. 8). Tajikistan is a member country of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC)12 program. It is thus important to align the updated transport sector program with the \nCAREC Transport Strategy 2030,13 to ensure regional connectivity with neighboring countries and \nadvance trade and economic integration.   \n \n8  World Bank. 2021. Assessment of Economic Impacts from Disasters Along Key Corridors. Washington, DC. \n9  The government, on 31 December 2020, adopted by governmental decree the Road Asset Management System \nAction Program as one initiative responding to the immediate need for sustaining the existing road infrastructure \nassets. On the same date, the MOT established the Road and Transport Digitalization Unit, which is responsible for \nimplementing the action program. \n10 The former eases the movement of people and goods between the two countries, while the latter requires circuitous \ntrade routes to seaports. \n11 Government of Tajikistan. 2016.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: economic growth promoted (footnote 11). The \nTA will have the following outcome: transport planning capacity of the government strengthened. \nThe indicators are: the government adopts the national transport sector program and the transport \nsector capacity development program by 2025, expected to be delivered under outputs 1 and 2.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: National transport sector program developed. The TA team will help update \nthe current transport sector program, which extends to 2025 (footnote 1), and prepare an \naccompanying rolling investment plan. The updated program will illustrate the sector\u2019s overall \ndevelopment direction for 2026\u20132040, together with strategies for each subsector,15 to ensure \nharmonization. Transport demand analysis will be carried out at country level, based on the \nperson-trip survey across the country to be conducted under the TA. This analysis will consider \nthe specific needs of women, vulnerable groups, and populations in isolated rural areas, since \nthey tend to find it difficult to access services that meet their basic needs.  Analysis is proposed \nat the scale of Central Asia to define regional transport prospects in consultation with the latest \nstudies under the CAREC program and other ongoing regional initiatives and studies. This \nanalysis will apply post-pandemic scenarios, since the coronavirus disease has changed people\u2019s \ntravel and economic behaviors, as well as the pattern of movements of goods. During the \nimplementation, the TA team will examine the  progress of the current  sector program, its \nchallenges, and the lessons gained, to be reflected in the updated program. The rolling investment \nplan is a timebound sector-wide tool to prioritize investments based on the analysis. The plan will \nbe a living document and will be updated periodically by the government following the guidelines \nto be produced under output 2. \n \n12.  Output 2: Transport sector capacity development program developed. The TA team \nwill produce two institutional guiding documents to ensure that the capacity of institutions is \nstrengthened sufficiently to deliver the updated national transport sector program. The first is the \ntransport sector capacity development strategy, which will illustrate the direction of the capacity \nbuilding effort and ensure that the sector\u2019s staff become capable to implement the updated \nnational transport sector program. The strategy is expected to cover all staff working in transport, \nincluding its subsectors, both at the central or regional levels. Second, transport sector planning \nguidelines will be developed as a reference for the MOT and the other agencies involved in \nupdating the rolling investment plan and conducting subsequent updates to the national transport \nsector program. Some of the staff will be trained and accredited as trainers on transport planning \nfor the next generation of staff. Those staff will be selected based on their qualifications and \nexperience. In addition, an internship program is planned for university and graduate students to \ngive them the opportunity to learn transport planning in practice with the MOT staff. The program \nwill include female students. The trainers' accreditation and the training and internship programs \nwill be designed with the MOT in accordance with its existing guidelines. At completion, it is \nplanned to produce a publication that reflects the TA activities and the lessons derived from them, \nand serves to share the transport planning experience with other developing countries and relevant \ninstitutions.    \n \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 The subsectors covered are roads, railways, civil aviation, and cross-border and logistics facilities. \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,368,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7), and (ii) $800,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR)16 and administered by ADB. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.17 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, logistics and \nadministrative assistance, training and workshop facilities, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n14.  Based on the JFPR\u2019s Policy Guidelines for Technical Assistance Grant (2020), eligible \nexpenditures  include  (i)  consulting  services;  (ii)  non-consulting  costs  for  local  training  and \nworkshops, minimal equipment such as computers,18 and operating costs essential to carry out \nthe TA, including vehicle rental, if justified; and (iii) knowledge partnerships. Non-consulting costs \nshall be kept to a minimum. The following are ineligible expenditures: (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) \nsalaries for civil servants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed \nengineering design, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those ruled out under \nADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List.19  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB, through the Transport and Communications Division of its Central and West Asia \nDepartment, will administer the disbursement of TA funds. The division will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants; organize workshops and seminars; and assist the MOT in quality assurance \nand coordination of all TA inputs and outputs. The MOT, as the executing agency, will coordinate \nthe TA implementation and will be accountable for the outputs, and the Economic Analysis and \nForecasting Department of the MOT will be responsible for implementing the TA. \n \n16.  A steering committee will be established as an oversight body for the TA, under the MOT\u2019s \nchair. The committee will comprise senior representatives from line ministries such as the Ministry \nof Economic Development and Trade and the Ministry of Finance, the transport subsector \nagencies, and the governments of the four oblasts. ADB and other development partners will \nparticipate as observers. The main tasks of the steering committee will be to (i) oversee the \ndevelopment of the outputs, (ii) provide overall guidance to the consultant team, (iii) make key \ndecisions for the smooth implementation of the TA, and (iv) approve the outputs once completed. \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n16 The Government of Japan approved on 15 September 2021 to finance the TA from the JFPR. Funding from the \nJFPR was increased to $800,000, from the $500,000 originally proposed in the concept paper. \n17 The JFPR is expected to finance (i) the national transport sector program for 2026\u20132040, including the rolling \ninvestment plan, under output 1; and (ii) the transport sector planning guidelines and transport sector capacity \ndevelopment strategy under output 2. The TASF is expected to finance the other activities under output 2 (trainers\u2019 \naccreditation and internship programs). \n18 ADB\u2019s pre-approval for procuring a package that includes travel modeling software, computers, and printers will be \nrequired. \n19 ADB. 2009.
