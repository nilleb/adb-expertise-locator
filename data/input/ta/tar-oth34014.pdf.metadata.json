INTRODUCTION\n1. The  persistence  of  micronutrient  malnutrition  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  is  a  concern  to\ngovernments in the region, all of which pledged at the World Summit for Children (1990) to\neliminate Vitamin A and iodine deficiencies as public health problems and substantially reduce iron\ndeficiency anemia. Progress has been made but not quickly enough. Three quarters of the world\u2019s\nmicronutrient deficient persons-well over a billion people-live in the region. A proven strategy for\neliminating micronutrient malnutrition is through enhancing the complementary contributions of the\npublic and private sectors to fortify commonly consumed foods, as happened in the industrialized\nworld in the middle of the last century.\n2. The potential for regional partnerships was dramatically demonstrated at the Manila Forum\non Food Fortification Policy cosponsored by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) and the\nMicronutrient Initiative, held at Asian Development Bank (ADB) headquarters from 22-24 February\n2000. Eight country teams from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Fiji, India, Indonesia,\nKyrgyz Republic, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam attended, led by captains of the food industry\nand government health and food officials. The Manila Forum reached consensus on a regional\nstrategy that will establish fortified foods as the standard for a range of staple foods widely\nconsumed by large segments of the population, especially the poor. These staple foods include\nsalt, flour, oils, infant foods, condiments, sugar, and dairy products. If implemented, this strategy\nwill maximize the reach of micronutrients to those who need them most.\n3. Based on the Manila Forum consensus, regional technical assistance1 (TA) is proposed,\nsupported by ADB, in partnership with Danish International Development Assistance (Danida) and\nILSI, to prepare an assessment of the requirements for modernizing the food industry in Asia to\nmake fortified food products accessible and affordable to the poor. A partnership of the public and\nprivate sectors is essential to enrich nutrition by improving consumer choice in the marketplace. A\nTA framework is attached as Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. Tiny amounts of vitamins and minerals are required by the human body for normal growth,\nfunctioning, and development. Fifty years ago economically advanced countries almost eliminated\nthese  vitamin  and  mineral  deficiencies  through  micronutrient  enriched  diets  and  dietary\nsupplements provided mostly by the private sector.\n5. In Asia and the Pacific, many people do not consume enough of these nutrients. Iodine,\nvitamin A, iron, zinc, folate and fluoride deficiencies are widespread. To combat iodine deficiency,\nuniversal addition of iodine to table salt has been adopted as a goal by most Asian countries and\non average 70 percent of households now consume iodized salt. Still, a billion Asians are not\nconsuming enough iodine. Iron deficiency is perhaps the most severe, with anemia currently\naffecting 60 percent of pregnant women, half of young infants, and 40 percent of preschoolers. 2\nWhile clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency (e.g., blindness, night blindness) have been reduced\nsubstantially, one third of mothers and young children are at high mortality risk from subclinical\ndeficiency. Supplementation is presently the main public sector strategy for addressing vitamin A3\nand iron deficiencies, but this is not a sustainable solution. Micronutrient malnutrition is much more\nthan a health sector problem. The World Bank4 estimates that the cost of micronutrient malnutrition\nto developing economies is at least 5 percent of gross domestic product.\n                                                \n1   The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 5 May 2000.\n2   Anemia is the main or associated cause for up to one fourth of maternal deaths during pregnancy in Asia.\n3  A United States Agency for International Development study (12 Asian countries) showed that a combination of vitamin\nA supplementation and fortification programs could save 714,000 preschool lives and avert blindness in 211,000\npeople.\n4 World Bank 1994. Enriching Lives: Overcoming Vitamin and Mineral Malnutrition in Developing Countries. Development\nin Practice Series.", "2\n6. Along with a growing understanding of the extent and impact of micronutrient malnutrition,\nseveral interventions have demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of correction and prevention.\nDistributing inexpensive capsules, diversifying to include more micronutrient-rich foods, or fortifying\ncommonly consumed foods can make an enormous difference. Correcting iodine, vitamin A, and\niron deficiencies can improve the population-wide intelligence quotient by 10-15 points, reduce\nmaternal deaths by one fourth, decrease infant and child mortality by 40 percent, and increase\npeople\u2019s work capacity by almost half. The elimination of these deficiencies will reduce health care\nand education costs, improve work capacity and productivity, and accelerate equitable economic\ngrowth and national development. Improved nutrition is essential to sustained economic growth.5\nMicronutrient deficiency elimination is as cost effective as the best public health interventions and\nfortification is the most cost-effective strategy.\n7. Most previous efforts focused on the elimination of micronutrient malnutrition have been\ndriven  by  national  activities  dominated  by  the  public  sector.  Governments  have  worked\nsuccessfully with the private sector to raise the production and consumption of iodized salt from\none fourth to two thirds of Asian households in the late 1990s. Now the lessons learned must be\napplied to other staples and fortificants. The challenge for the region is to galvanize the private\nsector to reach international standards of food quality and food safety at sufficient fortificant levels.\nHowever, the overall reach of fortified foods is still extremely small. The objective is therefore to\nrapidly expand the production and reach of fortified foods widely consumed by the poor.\n8. Food  fortification  must  be  an  integral  component  of  the  overall  strategy  to  eliminate\nmicronutrient  malnutrition.  It  involves  opening  new  communication  channels  among  all\nstakeholders: the public and private sectors, and civil society. Food fortification is a rare example\nwhere industry and trade, working in a largely commercial environment, are required to participate\nand play a leading role in a health intervention endeavor. It requires a partnership among industry,\nnational governments, international agencies, expert groups, and other stakeholders. The partners\nwill work closely on specific issues relating to technology development, food processing and\nmarketing, free market approaches with minimum price support mechanisms, standards, quality\nassurance, product certification, product labeling, social communications and demand creation,\ntariffs and trade regulations, and monitoring and evaluation.\n9. Public sector interest in reaching the most vulnerable populations must be balanced against\nprivate sector concerns about cost, commercial viability and consumer acceptance. The regional\nstudy to be conducted under the TA will address core themes so that countries can modernize their\nfood industries with a regional focus in view, and the region can act within the global trade\nenvironment to enhance its credibility in the international food trade. Six priority themes relate to\nthe strengthened capacity of the public and private sectors to find market-based solutions to\neliminate micronutrient malnutrition.\n10. Public Sector as Regulator and Enabler. The Manila Forum sent a clear signal to the\npublic health sector that unless regulations and policies create a fair and transparent environment\nfor doing business, there will be no incentive to fortify essential staples. As programs get under\nway,  effective  monitoring  of  process  and  outcome  variables  is  critical.  Programs  should  be\nenvisioned  as  long  lasting  with  evaluation  as  an  essential  component  to  identify  progress,\nproblems,  and  needs.  Three  areas  of  public  sector  capacity  building  must  be  strengthened:\nregulatory policy and standard setting that is feasible and certain to improve public health; capacity\nto  conduct  epidemiological  surveillance  and  monitoring  of  the  food  sector  to  document  both\nindustrial compliance with standards and impact on public nutrition; and the establishment of\nquality assurance systems for food safety. Human resources development needs must also be\nassessed to meet these requirements.\n                                                \n5 Behrman, J. 1992. Economic Rationale for Investing in Nutrition in Developing Countries. USAID, Washington, D.C.", "3\n11. Assessment and Dissemination of Food Fortification Technology. Among the widely\nconsumed staples, salt, flour, and cooking oils are the most promising food vehicles for universal\nfortification and a regional strategy is needed to fortify these staples. Based on the Latin American\nexperience in the 1990s, rapid progress can be made once the key public and private players\nunderstand the minimal cost implications of reducing micronutrient deficiencies.\n12. Creating Demand among the Poor. The importance of social communication cannot be\noverstressed. All available media should be used to educate the population on micronutrient\ndeficiencies, and on the importance and safety of fortified foods. Consumers should be educated to\ndemand a better product and accept a slightly higher price for that product, as long as the benefits\nto children and working adults are made clear from improved health, mental development, school\nachievement, and higher wages. A special gender emphasis is needed so that women as earners,\nconsumers, and primary caretakers for children are full participants in creating market demand for\nfortified foods. The design of social communications and public education programs must be\ntargeted to include the poor and linked to the marketing and distribution of fortified products.\n13. Supporting  Child  Development  through  Health  and  Industrial  Policy.  Meeting  the\nspecial physical and mental development needs of children under two is a challenge for the public\nand private sectors, whose respective roles include education for improved infant feeding practices\nand building a viable commercial market for enriched foods (that do not displace breastfeeding).\n14. Public Policies to Promote the Competitiveness and Affordability of Fortified Food\nProducts. Governments should make the region an influential force in the global food industry\nthrough appropriate pricing policies, tariffs and tax incentives, agricultural research, and technology\npolicy, and by using the opportunities to promote trade in an environment regulated by the World\nTrade Organization.\n15. Creating Country Investment Plans (CIPs). Feasibility studies of both public and private\nsector needs and capabilities in each participating country will help to identify menu of options for\nresource mobilization among donors and lending institutions. The feasibility analysis will require\ndifferent  skill  mixes  for  the  public  and  private  sectors.  While  the  selected  countries  do  not\nnecessarily cover all requirements for Asia as a whole, as a group they represent an important and\ninfluential bloc that could take the region forward. The regional study will be useful in bringing\ninvestors, governments, and captains of industry together in a common cause.\nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n16. The objectives of the TA are to (i) identify regional issues and actions required to accelerate\nproduction of micronutrient-fortified foods; (ii) support regional dialogue on issues related to food\nstandards, regulations, trade, and surveillance; (iii) create a framework for regional fortification of\ncertain essential staples; (iv) develop a comprehensive social marketing and communications plan\nfor (iii); (v) link fortification policies and programs to poverty reduction and human development in\nthe region; and (vi) develop CIPs in selected developing member countries (DMCs). Fortification of\nstaple foods directly supports poverty reduction and raises the quality of human capital, both key\nADB objectives.\nB.  Scope\n17. The TA will support two main activities. First, it will help DMC research teams to develop\nmedium-term CIPs to eliminate micronutrient malnutrition, based on feasibility studies of the public\nand private sectors. CIPs will be reviewed in an investment roundtable convened by ADB to\nassemble governments, interested funding agencies, and philanthrophic institutions.", "4\n18. Second, the TA will sponsor the following regional meetings to increase knowledge of best\npractices and build capacity in the region: (i) an inception meeting at ADB where the investment\nguidelines for the CIPs and the terms of reference for the other regional workshops will be decided;\n(ii) a meeting in Beijing, the People\u2019s Republic of China, on completing the universal salt iodization\nagenda for the region; (iii) two regional workshops on food technology\u2014the first in New Delhi,\nIndia, on wheat flour and cooking oils and the second on complementary foods (venue to be\ndecided); (iv) a regional consultation at the Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University, Bangkok,\nThailand, on four interrelated issues\u2014surveillance, food monitoring, regulation, and trade; and (v)\na concluding investors\u2019 roundtable hosted by ADB. An investors\u2019 primer will be prepared for this\nroundtable meeting\u2019s participants, synthesizing the findings of the TA. A web site will be set up so\nthat TA data, reports, and workshop proceedings can be rapidly accessed.\n19. The  TA  will  focus  on  PRC,  India,  Indonesia,  Pakistan,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  The\ncountries  were  selected  by  consensus  by  the  Manila  Forum  sponsors.  The  criteria  were  (i)\nmicronutrient deficiencies affecting the poor disproportionately, with existing programs less than\noptimally effective; (ii) sound public health infrastructure for strengthening capacity to monitor\nnutrition  status  and  introduce  transparent  regulatory  practices;  (iii)  strong  history  of  rational\nmacroeconomic  planning  so  that  defined  investment  requirements  will  be  recognized  by\npolicymakers and efforts to mobilize resources from development partners will be effectively used;\nand  (iv)  important  initiatives  in  fortified  products  exist  but  an  industrywide  assessment  of\ntechnological  and  financial  requirements  to  move  fortified  staples  into  general  consumption\npatterns.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n20. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,285,000, of which ADB will contribute  $800,000,\nthe Danida Trust Fund $300,000, and ILSI $50,000. The balance of $135,000 equivalent will be\nprovided by participating DMC governments. Cost estimates are in Appendix 2. The TA will be\nfinanced by ADB on a grant basis, from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of\nJapan.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n21. The regional assessment and action plan will be developed by ADB\u2019s agriculture and social\nsector departments, the infrastructure, energy and financial sector departments and Private Sector\nGroup. The TA will be managed by ADB\u2019s Education, Health and Population Division (East),\nAgriculture  and  Social  Sectors  Department  (East)  assisted  by  the  Private  Sector  Group  and\nsupported by a small working group from associated departments.\n22. ADB will cosponsor the TA with ILSI and Danida. ADB will administer the Danida grant and\nILSI will manage its own resources in preparing a regional workshop. Danida has a long history of\nsupporting international programs for eliminating micronutrient malnutrition.6 ILSI7 brings a highly\nrespected  reputation  for  advising  the  multinational  food  industry  on  food  safety  and  quality\nassurance, as well as innovative nutrition education and scientific research to guide food company\nproduction decisions. Under the TA, ILSI will also lead a regional dialogue on the prospects for\nestablishing a science-based regional resource center for food quality testing, laboratory science,\nand research and training on food technology and fortification. The US Centers for Disease Control\n(CDC) will advise the project on public health issues. CDC brings an unmatched reputation for\nadvising  Asian  public  health  services  on  capacity  building  for  population  surveillance  of\nmicronutrients status. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has\n                                                \n6  A prominent example is the Micronutrients Project of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research\n(1994-present).\n7  ILSI is the leading private sector foundation supported by the multinational food industry and provides excellent\ntechnical reviews of cutting edge food technology, including fortification. ILSI has regional offices in Asia, Latin\nAmerica, and Europe.", "5\nexpressed interest in advising DMCs\u2019 food quality testing and levels of fortification under the\numbrella of the Codex Alimentarius, an international code on food composition, quality, and safety\nstandards.\n23. An international firm will be recruited to provide consulting services, contract and supervise\nthe country research teams, and prepare all TA reports and conference proceedings. Simplified\nproposals will be required from shortlisted firms. A portion of the Danida resources will be reserved\nby ADB to support DMC participation in the October 2000 Beijing meeting on salt iodization.\nAdditional DMCs will be included within the budget constraints. The selected consulting firm will be\nresponsible for an inception report, proceedings from all regional forums, CIPs according to agreed\nguidelines, and the Investors\u2019 Primer.\n24. Each DMC will nominate a country research team to prepare the CIP, and upon ADB\napproval the team will be contracted by the international firm to do so. Each DMC will designate an\nexecuting agency for the TA and constitute an inter-agency steering committee including public\nofficials, private industry, and women\u2019s and consumer groups. The inception meeting will agree on\nthe guidelines for CIPs, workshop proceedings, the TA synthesis report (Investors\u2019 Primer), a\ntimetable for all activities, and web site requirements for the TA. DMCs will nominate participants in\nall TA activities. TA activities will begin in October 2000, with DMC participation in the regional\nUniversal  Salt  Iodization  seminar  in  Beijing  and  conclude  with  the  Investors\u2019  Roundtable  in\nMarch/April 2002.8 The inception meeting will be held in February 2001, the wheat flour and\ncooking oil workshop in March 2001, the complementary foods workshop in the second quarter\n2001, and the workshop on surveillance, food monitoring, regulation, and trade in the third quarter\n2001. The CIPs will be subjected to technical reviews in the third and fourth quarters of 2001, and\nthe approved CIPs will be presented for the consideration of donors and philanthropic institutions\nat the Roundtable.\n25. A total of 23 person-months of international consulting services will be required in the\nfollowing areas of expertise: (i) private sector investment, (ii) public sector investment, (iii) cooking\noil fortification technology, (iv) flour fortification technology, (v) complementary foods technology,\n(vi) surveillance, (vii) food monitoring and quality assurance, (viii) regulatory and trade policy, (ix)\ncommunications, and (x) nutrition economics/investment planning. All consultants will be selected\nand engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB. The TA will finance country research teams to prepare six CIPs.\nIn addition, ADB will recruit a local consultant for web site development and management, two\ntechnical assistants to coordinate TA activities and prepare and consolidate documentation and\npublications, and a copy editor. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n26.
