INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asia and the Pacific region is off-track in achieving every one of the 17 Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has set the \nregion back even further, especially for women, exacerbating vulnerabilities related to socially \nfocused SDGs particularly poverty and inequality, health, and education.1 Progress against \nenvironmental SDGs (e.g., taking action on climate change, promoting responsible consumption \nand production, and protecting life on land and below water) has been particularly slow.2 Fiscal \nconstraints compounded by COVID-19 further impede the ability of developing member countries \n(DMCs) to address the SDGs in a holistic manner alongside short-term crisis-response measures.  \n \n2.  Achieving the 17 SDGs is a focus of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030.3 \nADB has articulated its theory of change4 for supporting its DMCs to make progress on the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development.5 The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \ncluster will\u2014through practical research and analysis, policy advice, and capacity building\u2014\nsupport DMCs to advance SDG implementation by enabling them to develop and deliver more \neffective results-based programming.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The  emphasis  on  the  SDGs  in  DMC  national  development  planning  and  financing \nprocesses is uneven. Under past TA projects, ADB has established unique partnerships with the \nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia Pacific (ESCAP) and the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), which have addressed some of the gaps in SDG data \nin the region and assessed DMC progress toward attaining the SDGs and to identify opportunities \nto accelerate this progress.6 ADB has also supported SDG coordination and knowledge at the \ncountry level. Ongoing work has highlighted that, although most DMCs have established SDG \ncoordination institutions and are reporting on their efforts to achieve the SDGs, integration of the \nSDGs into critical national systems remains uneven. Significant gaps remain when it comes to \nintegrating  the  SDGs  into  planning,  budgeting,  financing,  and  developing  SDG-targeted \nprograms.7 Surveys of stakeholders in ADB DMCs suggest that there is a strong need and strong \ndemand for continued work on these issues, including through sustaining, expanding, and \nramping up partnerships.8 \n \n4.  Good  practices  and  lessons  for  ensuring  that  development  partner  and  national \ngovernment operations are effective in achieving the SDGs are not collected, disseminated, or \napplied regularly. Gaps remain in (i) understanding lessons related to strengthened project design \n \n1   Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP), Asian development Bank and United Nations \nDevelopment Programme. 2021.

DMCs' capacity to better manage results by designing and monitoring programs that will \nsupport progress in achieving the SDGs also remains limited. Weaknesses in results-focused \nproject design and monitoring have impinged on project success rates, signaling a need to help \nDMC counterparts develop and use more effective design and monitoring frameworks (DMFs).10 \nPast TA projects have provided training, tools, and knowledge exchange to help DMCs improve \nresults-focused project design and implementation. DMC officials, through consultations held to \nprepare ADB country partnership strategies (CPS) and through post-workshop feedback surveys, \nhave indicated that this support needs to continue.11  \n \n6.   The TA will emphasize the cross-cutting and interlinked challenges of reducing poverty \n(SDG  1)  and  inequality  (SDG  10)  and  promoting  gender  equality  (SDG  5),  environmental \nsustainability (SDG 12), and climate action (SDG 13). It will focus on national and regional \ninstitutions, complementing in-depth work on specific SDGs led by ADB sector and thematic \ngroups (STGs). \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n7.  The TA cluster modality enables flexibility in design, implementation, allocation of funds, \nand sequencing of TA activities to respond to expressed demand through the TA project's four \nsubprojects (Appendix 2). Each of the four subprojects will support all three outputs of the TA \ncluster in an integrated manner. Specific activities under each output will be tailored to enhance \nintegration of SDGs into DMC programming, financing, and knowledge (para. 17). The TA cluster \nbuilds on the work of three previous related TA projects and enables ADB to establish a long-term \nprogram of responsive support for the SDGs and strengthened results management, while \nallowing for more efficient and integrated delivery of policy advice, knowledge and capacity \nbuilding support to DMCs.12 It will support implementation of ADB Management\u2019s response to the \n2021 Annual Evaluation Review of ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department (footnote 8), which \nrecommended that ADB sustain and deepen its support for country level action to implement the \nSDGs in the context of COVID-19 recovery, and to assess SDG financing needs and opportunities \nin a context of fiscal stress.  \n \n \n9    ADB. 2017. Knowledge and Support Technical Assistance for Enhancing Operational Results Delivery. Manila.  \n10 The success rate of ADB-financed operations continues to remain below target. This is due in part to DMF-related \nissues, which were a major factor in projects rated less than effective. Many projects lacked sufficient data to verify \nthe achievement of all DMF targets. These issues point to a need to support more effective DMFs and associated \nresults management capacity in DMCs. ADB. 2021. 2020 Development Effectiveness Review. Manila. \n11 For example, the large majority of officials from the eight DMCs that participated in the results-focused design and \nmonitoring workshops delivered to date under the ongoing Enhancing Operational Results Delivery TA project (TA \n9358-REG) indicated in feedback surveys that the training was \"very useful,\" and most indicated that they and their \ncolleagues would benefit from access to more regular training and support to help them effectively apply good \npractices to strengthen results management.

The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: DMCs\u2019 effective achievement of the \nSDGs increased.13 The TA will have the following outcome: Higher-quality programs and projects \nthat advance the SDGs developed and delivered by ADB DMCs.14 It will achieve this by providing \na diverse suite of knowledge products and platforms, including data analysis tools, interactive \nweb-based learning, and practical research. The TA cluster incorporates lessons from previous \nrelated TA projects and will support deliverables and activities for three outputs.  \n \n9.  Output 1: Developing member countries' knowledge and capacity to align planned \nprograms and financing with the SDGs strengthened. Under output 1, ADB will provide policy \nadvice to DMCs to strengthen the alignment of their programming, financing incentives, and \npractices with the SDGs. ADB\u2019s partnerships with UNDP and UN ESCAP on the SDGs will play \na key role in delivery of output 1. Key activities of the partnership include: (i) maintaining a joint \nweb-based portal compiling available SDG Data and enabling diverse analysis of national and \ngoal-level SDG progress; (ii) producing an annual joint report and associated knowledge products \non distinct dimensions of SDG progress in the region; and (iii) convening policy makers and other \nstakeholders in Asia and the Pacific to reflect on opportunities to accelerate progress on the \nSDGs.15 Through this TA project, ADB and its partners will sustain and expand such initiatives.  \n \n10.  The output will also support country-focused knowledge and policy advice on SDG \nimplementation and financing strategies, including in the context of COVID-19 recovery. This will \nbuild  on  work  done  under  past  TA  projects16  to  develop  and  pilot  country  level  SDG \nimplementation assessment methodologies; it may also include support for related initiatives, \nsuch as DMC efforts to develop Integrated National Financing Frameworks17 and/or integration \nof the SDGs into regional cooperation programs. ADB will make a concerted effort to include and \nengage government institutions responsible for women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality. In \naddition, it will produce synthesis knowledge and policy advice, drawing on country studies, or \nfocusing on specific themes such as private sector investment for the SDGs.  \n \n11.  Activities will be undertaken in at least 16 DMCs and aim for regional balance.  Selection \nwill occur in consultation with regional departments and STGs through ADB\u2019s SDG Working \nGroup on a rolling basis, and prioritize countries where ADB will be working with the government \nto update a CPS. The TA may also support DMCs that identified SDG implementation knowledge \nneeds  during  CPS  or  country  knowledge  program  preparation;  or  countries  who  will  be \nundertaking voluntary national reporting to the international community through the High-Level \nPolitical Forum.18    \n \n13 ADB. 2018.

Output 2: Developing member countries' knowledge of good practices and lessons \nfrom operations increased. Output 2 will support documentation, analysis, and dissemination \nof experiences and lessons from DMC programming\u2014particularly from ADB-financed projects\u2014\nand that has advanced the SDGs. Activities under this output comprise: (i) disseminating practical \nand actionable good practices and recommendations on managing for sustainable development \nresults, which DMCs and other development partners can apply to strengthen future programs \nthat  contribute  to  the  SDGs;  (ii)  supporting  research  on  factors  that  impede  development \neffectiveness and success rates, such as poor project sustainability and replicability, building on \nwork initiated under prior TA programs;19 (iii) analyzing approaches to results management and \nto measuring project contributions against the cross-cutting SDGs on zero poverty, reduced \ninequalities, gender equality, climate action, and responsible consumption and production; and \n(iv) sustaining work initiated under past related TA projects to develop and apply tools that assess \nthe quality of infrastructure investments and their contributions to the SDGs.  \n \n13.   Planned knowledge work streams will be designed to be accessible to the target audience \nof DMC executing and implementing agencies, ADB staff, civil society, and other development \npartners. Activities will actively engage ADB STGs and subject matter specialists in ADB DMCs. \nThey may include tailored interactive events and short written briefs drawing out key messages.20 \nThe focus areas will be elaborated in the TA subprojects in a phased approach over the duration \nof the TA. Work that builds on lessons in developing quality infrastructure that supports the SDGs \nwill leverage ADB\u2019s ongoing partnership with the SOURCE infrastructure project preparation \nplatform managed by the Sustainable Infrastructure Foundation.21  \n \n14.  Output 3: Developing member countries' capacity for SDG aligned results-based \nproject design and management strengthened. Output 3 will focus on building capacity in \nDMCs for effective results management in SDG aligned and ADB-financed operations. Activities \nwill develop the capacity of government counterparts\u2013particularly executing and implementing \nagency staff, focusing on good practices for using the DMF throughout the project cycle. The DMF \nsupports  a  structured  approach  to  designing  development projects by  requiring  a  focus  on \nachievable and measurable results from project identification until completion.  \n \n15.  ADB will expand the provision of E-learning and advisory services focused on results-\nbased project design and management, including project preparation and the use of DMFs. E-\nlearning will explain basic results management practices, provide practical guidance, and make \nuse  of  participatory  and  interactive  approaches,  including  coaching  sessions,  to  provide \nexperiential  learning  and  encourage  participants  to  apply  these  practices  on  the  job. The \nknowledge, skills, and tools that participants gain from the E-learning courses are expected to \nbuild  institutional  capacity  within  their  agencies  and  advance  their  individual  professional \ndevelopment. Under Output 3, ADB will also develop and disseminate guidance notes and other \ntools for SDG aligned, results-based project design and management. These will target  project \ndirectors,  planners,  implementers,  and  monitoring  staff,  including  gender  focal  points, \nfrom executing  and  implementing  agencies  of ADB-financed  projects.22  ADB  operational \n \n19  ADB. 2017.

ADB will prioritize inviting departments and agencies involved in \nforthcoming ADB-financed operations based on indicative project pipelines, and in projects under development or in \nearly stages of implementation. To incentivize participation, participants will receive certificates of completion upon \nsuccessfully completing a course.  \n ", "5 \ndepartments, resident missions, and DMC partners will help (i) identify participants for training \nprograms, considering the roles and responsibilities of DMC officials and ADB\u2019s project pipeline; \n(ii) analyze DMCs\u2019 existing project monitoring and evaluation arrangements, systems, and tools, \nand  identify  ways  to  build  on  and  improve  these;  and  (iii)  identify  common  results-based \nmanagement challenges for ADB-financed operations in DMCs, and ensure that solutions to \nthese are emphasized in the curriculum.23  \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Detailed cost estimates and financing \narrangements will be presented in each TA subproject proposal submitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA cluster and the Results Management and Aid Effectiveness \nDivision (SPRA) of the Strategy, Policy and Partnerships Department will be the executing \nagency. Implementation of the TA will make use of existing structures and mechanisms that allow \nSPRA to work with STGs, operational departments, resident missions, and subregional offices on \nthe planned outputs. Key mechanisms include (i) the SDG Working Group24 and its designated \nfocal points from operational departments (including PSOD), STGs, and knowledge departments; \n(ii) designated focal points for managing for development results and DMFs in operational \ndepartments; and (iii) existing working groups that focus on operational research themes (e.g., \nthe Sustainability Working Group formed in 2020). All country-focused activities will actively \nengage  regional  departments  and  resident  missions.  Activities  will  be  reflected  in  country \nknowledge plans as appropriate. Each TA subproject proposal will be submitted for approval to \nthe director general of the Strategy, Policy and Partnerships Department.
