Since the adoption of the agriculture and natural resources research (ANRR) policy \npaper in 1995, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported Consultative Group on \nInternational  Agricultural  Research  (CGIAR)  centers  and  other  non-CGIAR  international \nagricultural research centers (IARCs) through an annual regional technical assistance (RETA) \ngrant. ADB\u2019s policy on ANRR addresses three strategic objectives: sustainable management of \nnatural  resources,  increases  in  agricultural  productivity,  and  poverty  reduction.  Ten  RETA \ngrants have so far been approved, each supporting one or several projects of IARCs. \n \n2.  A  special  evaluation  study1 of  the  ANRR  policy  carried  out  in  2000  recommended \ncontinued support to the IARCs based on high returns on investments, relevance of the policy \nand research outputs of supported projects, and overall effectiveness of the annual RETA \nmodality. While the ANRR policy specifies yearly ADB funding of $5.0 million to support ANRR, \nthe support has been decreasing since 2000, and amounted to $3.0 million in 2003 and 2004 \nand $1.0 million in 2005. The RETAs have played an integral role in fulfilling ADB\u2019s operational \nobjectives in participating developing member countries (DMCs). They have also addressed, in \nvarying degrees, ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction and related priorities such as \nregional cooperation and sustainable environmental management. \n \n3.  The  proposed  RETA2 will  be the  Eleventh  RETA  on  ANRR.3 Based  on  the  criteria \nestablished in the Guidelines on Submission of Project Proposals4 for RETAs on ANRR, the \nregional  directors  of  the  agriculture,  environment  and  natural  resources  divisions  and  the \nagriculture, natural resources and social services division assessed the three concept notes that \nhad been received by September 2006 for consideration under the Eleventh RETA on ANRR. \nProject proposals were prioritized based on the level of preparation, links with ADB\u2019s poverty \nreduction strategy, and relevance and synergy with ADB operations. Considering the total funds \navailable for 2006, two proposals were selected for inclusion in the proposed RETA: (i) one \nsubmitted by The World Vegetable Center (AVRDC, formerly the Asian Vegetable Research \nand  Development  Center),  and  (ii)  one  by  the  International  Food  Policy  Research  Center \n(IFPRI).  These  projects  are  expected  to  promote  the  development,  application,  and \ndissemination of scientific research on problems faced by poor farmer households in Asia. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  In September 2000, heads of states adopted the Millennium Declaration confirming their \ncountries\u2019 commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a set of eight \nquantified and specific time-bound targets for addressing the many dimensions of extreme \npoverty\u2014from income poverty, hunger, and health to education, environment, and gender. One \nof the Millennium Declaration\u2019s most decisive goals, the first goal, aims at eradicating extreme \npoverty and hunger by reducing by half between 1990 and 2015 the proportion of people living \non less than $1 a day, and of people suffering from hunger. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2000. Special Evaluation Study on the Policy Implementation and Impact of Agriculture and Natural \nResources Research. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 October 2006. \n3  It  was  originally  part  of  the  interregional  RETA  program  for  2006\u20132008  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, and was transferred to the East Asia Department with the reassignment of the ADB-\nwide focal point responsibilities for the agriculture and natural resources sector in August 2006.  \n4  ADB. 2005. Guidelines for Project Proposal Submissions as Part of the Agriculture and Natural Resources \nResearch at International Agricultural Research Centers. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  Despite  recent  progress,  especially  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Asia \ncontinues to be home to two thirds of the world\u2019s absolutely poor and food-insecure people. \nAbout 650 million people in Asia are absolutely poor, living on less than $1 a day, down from \n934 million in 1990. Around 520 million people lack sufficient access to food to lead healthy, \nproductive lives\u2014down from 570 million in 1990. Given that the majority of poor people live in \nrural areas and/or rely on agriculture, and that agriculture paves the way for economic growth in \npoorer nations, the agriculture sector continues to underlie progress on the broad array of \neconomic and social indicators emphasized by the MDGs, in particular the first goal.5 \n \n6.  Investing  in  ANRR  is  one  of  the  most  effective  means  of  reducing  poverty  and \nstimulating agricultural and economic growth, through improvements in productivity. A recent \nstudy carried out a comprehensive survey of the literature on agricultural research since 1953 \nand  statistically  analyzed  reported  rates  of  return.  Its  results  showed  that,  despite  a  wide \nvariability, average rates of return are very high. Furthermore, the study found no evidence to \nsupport the view that rates of returns have declined over time.6 \n \n7.  CGIAR, created in 1971, is a strategic alliance of countries, international and regional \norganizations, and private foundations supporting 15 IARCs that work with national agricultural \nresearch systems (NARSs) and civil society organizations, including the private sector. It aims \nto achieve sustainable food security and reduce poverty through scientific agricultural research. \nCGIAR\u2019s areas of focus are sustainable production, enhancing NARSs, germplasm collection \nand improvement, and policy. CGIAR has been the driving force behind the Green Revolution; it \nhas  spearheaded  international  agricultural  research  and  acted  as  the  focus  for  global \ninvestment in research for development. A recent study on the benefits of CGIAR research \nagainst the cost of operating the whole system up to 2001 found that the value of documented \nbenefits generated by CGIAR surpasses the total investment in the system even when analyzed \nfrom the most conservative perspective.7 \n \n8.  Most outcomes of agricultural research are of the public goods type, so they can be \njustified  under  grant  financing.  In  Asia,  ANRR  has  played  an  important  role  in  promoting \nagricultural  and  rural  development  over  the  past  three  decades,  and  ADB  as  the  key \ndevelopment institution in Asia has significant potential to further expand that role. Changes that \nANRR has set in place have contributed to agricultural productivity increases and a reduction of \npoverty. According to the special evaluation study (footnote 1), ADB investments have paid \nlarge dividends. For the subset of projects assessed in the special evaluation study, the average \ninternal rate of return for all funds invested in the projects was 65%. A summary of ADB\u2019s \nassistance to the IARCs, including CGIAR, is in Appendix 1. \n \n9.  The proposed RETA builds on the experience of previous ADB-funded RETAs on ANRR. \nIt  notes the finding  of the  special  evaluation  study  that, given  ADB\u2019s  limited resources to \ncontribute to ANRR, a focused agenda that more closely follows ADB\u2019s overarching goal of \npoverty reduction is required. The design of the RETA also incorporates key lessons from the \nprevious RETAs, including the need for greater emphasis on (i) strengthening NARS capacity; \n                                                \n5  Rosegrant, Mark W., Claudia Ringler, Todd Benson, Xinshen Diao, Danielle Resnick, James Thurlow, Maximo \nTorero, and David Orden. 2005.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  proposed  RETA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  ANRR,  and  reinforces  the \npriorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II and the Enhanced Poverty Reduction \nStrategy. The RETA aims at increasing the incomes of farmer households and reducing rural \npoverty and hunger in the participating DMCs. The outcome of the RETA is expanded pro-poor \nagricultural research and dissemination, and improved awareness of policy makers and the \npublic of appropriate strategies and actions to reduce and ultimately end hunger and poverty. \n \n11.  The key RETA outputs are (i) development and dissemination of postharvest operations \nand  processing  technologies  for  vegetable  commodities  with  a  pro-poor  focus,  and \n(ii) promotion of a multi-stakeholder research-based dialogue on new strategies and actions to \nend  hunger  and  poverty  for  those  not  reached  by  the  MDG  processes.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework of the RETA is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed RETA will support two stand-alone projects, both of which contribute \ntoward the strategic objectives of ADB\u2019s policy on ANRR: sustainable management of natural \nresources, increased agricultural productivity, and poverty reduction. The projects have been \nidentified in close consultation with participating DMCs, and will be implemented independently \nby two IARCs: AVRDC and IFPRI. The synopses of the projects are in paras. 13\u201316, and the \ndetailed project descriptions are in Appendixes 3 and 4. \n \n13.  Supporting Pro-Poor Vegetable Value Chains in Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nCountries. By expanding postharvest operations and processing technology development, the \nAVRDC project will contribute toward reducing losses of vegetable commodities in rural upland \nareas of the GMS countries. It will build on and expand the activities carried out under the \nImproving  Rural  Livelihoods  through  Development  of  Vegetable-Based  Postharvest \nTechnologies  project, 8  which  focused  on  peri-urban  areas  in  Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam. The pro-poor orientation of the research efforts \nwill be greatly strengthened by a shift in the focus to poverty-stricken upland areas. The project \nwill further build the capacity of the NARSs to conduct research on postharvest operations and \nprocessing technologies by expanding into leafy vegetables. Regional experience sharing and \ntraining activities will be expanded to all GMS countries, including Myanmar, Thailand, and \nYunnan and Guanxi provinces of the PRC.  \n \n14.  Key activities will include (i) identifying market opportunities in poverty-stricken upland \nareas, including Kampong Seam and Ba Koung districts in Cambodia; Van Viang and Kasy \ndistricts in Lao PDR;9 Tam Nong, Lac Thuy, Thanh Chuong, and A Luoi districts in Viet Nam; (ii) \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2004.

Promoting  a  Multi-Stakeholder  Dialogue  on  New  Strategies  and  Actions  for \nReducing Hunger and Poverty with a Focus on Agriculture and Rural Development in \nAsia.  The  project  will  contribute  to  a  high-level  dialogue,  including  the  preparation  of \nbackground research papers and other documents for a global conference organized by IFPRI \nand the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development (LGOPAD) \nof the PRC, to be held in Beijing in the fourth quarter of 2007\u2014halfway between 2000 when the \nMillennium Declaration was adopted, and 2015 when the MDGs are planned to be achieved. \nThe  conference  is  provisionally  titled  \u201cHalving  Hunger  and  Poverty  is  Not  Enough:  New \nStrategies and Actions beyond the Millennium Development Goals.\u201d \n \n16.  Key  activities  comprise  (i)  in  the  lead-up  to  the  conference,  undertaking  research, \nsharing international experiences, and improving the knowledge base on strategies and actions \nfor reducing hunger and poverty; (ii) a high-level policy dialogue at ADB in mid-2007 focused on \nthe role of small-scale agriculture and rural development for alleviating poverty and hunger in \nAsia; (iii) convening the global conference with thematic sessions and regional forums, including \nan Asia Forum that will facilitate sharing ADB\u2019s experience; and (iv) following the conference, \nstrategic briefings on the outcomes of the conference at ADB, and additional briefings for DMCs \nand key Asian institutions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $1,300,000. ADB will finance $1,000,000, \ncomprising $500,000 for the proposal by AVRDC and $500,000 for the proposal by IFPRI. The \nRETA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. AVRDC will contribute \n$155,000 over 3 years; and the governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will provide \n$20,000 in the form of staff time, office accommodation, transport, and operational research \nsupport. IFPRI will contribute $125,000 over 2 years. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The RETA will follow the implementation arrangements used in previous ADB-financed \nRETAs for ANRR. ADB will enter into separate technical assistance (TA) agreements with each \nIARC. Each executing agency (EA) will be responsible for implementing and completing its own \nproject. AVRDC, through its head office in Shanhua, Taipei, China, will be the EA for the project \non Supporting Pro-Poor Vegetable Value Chains in GMS Countries; and IFPRI, with its head \noffice in Washington, D.C., United States, for the project on Promoting a Multi-Stakeholder \nDialogue on New Strategies and Actions for Reducing Hunger and Poverty with a Focus on \nAgriculture and Rural Development in Asia. Under the AVRDC project, the three participating \nNARSs will be designated as the implementing agencies (IAs), and will collaborate closely with \nthe IARC. The participating NARSs have sent letters of commitment to this effect. Each EA will \nappoint a project team coordinator who will coordinate, plan, and supervise all local project \nactivities; monitor project progress; and submit required reports to ADB and other collaborating \npartners. Similarly, each IA will appoint a country team coordinator who will be responsible for \ncoordination, implementation, and reporting on the project activities.  ", "  5 \n \n19.  The  RETA  is  expected  to  commence  in  January  2007  and  be  completed  in \nDecember 2009. The AVRDC project will be implemented over 3 years (i.e., from January 2007 \nup to December 2009), and the IFPRI project over 2 years (i.e., from January 2007 up to \nDecember 2008). Each project will hold an inception workshop within 3 months after it starts to \nfirm up project plans and implementing arrangements with partners. AVRDC will also organize \nannual planning and review meetings and a project completion workshop which all project \npartners, including ADB, will attend. Each IARC must submit the following reports to ADB: (i) an \ninception  report,  (ii)  semiannual  progress  reports;  (iii)  semiannual  financial  statements \naccounting for the use of project funds; (iv) audited annual financial statements, including the \nuse of project funds; and (v) a draft final completion report to obtain ADB comments before \nsubmission of the final report. The inception reports will be submitted within 3 months of the \nstart of each project; the semiannual progress reports and financial statements every 6 months; \nand the comprehensive completion report within 3 months of project closure. Funds will be \ndrawn  down  in  semiannual  installments  based  on  each  IARC\u2019s  estimate  of  forthcoming \nexpenditures, and subject to satisfactory liquidation of expenditures for previously disbursed \nfunds.  Project  officers  with  suitable  technical  expertise  will  be  assigned  to  administer  the \nprojects at ADB, and will undertake at least one supervisory mission yearly to each project. \n \n20.  The participating IARCs will procure goods and related services in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). At the end of each \nproject, equipment purchased under the RETA will be assigned to the EA/IAs that have been \nusing the equipment during project implementation.  \n \n21.  The IARCs have made plans for disseminating the outputs and outcome evaluation. \nAVRDC will widely distribute training materials, technical reports, and working papers through \nNARSs and other stakeholders, including through the postharvest webpage developed under \nthe  Improving  Rural  Livelihoods  through  Development  of  Vegatable-Based  Postharvest \nTechnologies project (footnote 8).10 At least three scientific articles will be published in peer-\nreviewed journals. Monitoring will be based on the semiannual submission of progress reports \nfrom the participating DMCs as well as the monitoring of progress indicators, targets, and work \nplan  identified  during  the  initial  and  ensuing  workshops.  Community  stakeholders  will  be \ninvolved  in  the  consultation  process.  IFPRI  will  make  all  outputs\u2014including  background \nresearch papers and policy briefs, and conference and policy forum proceedings\u2014available to \nconference participants and key stakeholder groups through a variety of modalities, including \nprint and electronic means. Special efforts will be made to feed the information emerging from \nthe  conference  process  into  key  policy  and  decision  making  processes.  A  comprehensive \nconference website will be set up. Following the conference, a survey will be conducted of the \nparticipants. An impact assessment of the conference will be undertaken in the year following \nthe conference. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor  the  Eleventh  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  Research  at  International  Agricultural \nResearch Centers, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n10 http://www.avrdc.org/postharvest \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nRELEVANT INFORMATION ON ADB-SUPPORTED CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON \nINTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH (CGIAR) CENTERS  \nAND NON-CGIAR CENTERS \nTable A1.1: ADB Support for International Agricultural  \nResearch Centers and Organizations, 1975\u20132005 \n($\u2019000) \nCenter  1975\u20131980  1981\u20131985  1986\u20131990  1991\u20131995  1996\u20132000a  2001\u20132005b  Total  Total \nProjects \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  agriculture  sector  in  the  countries  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)\u2014\ncomprising  Cambodia,  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  Myanmar,  Thailand, \nViet Nam, and Yunnan and Guangxi provinces of the People's Republic of China (PRC)\u2014faces \nnew  opportunities  and  challenges  as  these  economies  are  increasingly  integrated  into \ninternational markets through accession to the framework of the World Trade Organization, and \nbilateral and regional free trade agreements. Because of their weak product competitiveness in \ninternational markets, there is a strong need to promote linkages among key stakeholders \n(producers, traders, product processors, and consumers) to generate increased commodity and \nproduct values.  \n \n2.  The development of vegetable production and supply chains, and the improvement of \ntheir  competitiveness,  can  be  an  important  tool  for  improving  rural  livelihoods.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has supported the efforts of The World Vegetable Center (AVRDC, \nformerly the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center) in this area through regional \ntechnical assistance (RETA) since 1996. Under the Technical Assistance for Establishment of a \nVegetable Research Network1 and the Technical Assistance for Strengthening the Collaborative \nVegetable Research Network,2 collaborative vegetable research activities were funded in the \nhot-wet environments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam (collectively referred to as CLV). \nFurthermore,  ADB  helped  to  establish  the  CLV  Network  (CLVNET),  a  regional  vegetable \nnetwork.  Within  CLVNET,  the  national  research  programs  have  been  actively  involved  in \ncountry-specific and region-wide research identifying disease-resistant vegetable varieties. Yet, \nCLVNET  has  also  shown  the  need  of  CLV  countries  to  shift  their  research  focus  into \npostharvest research. As reflected in their medium-term development plans, the CLV countries \nhave recognized the strong need for advanced agricultural science and technology in this area. \nIn  response,  ADB  started  to  support  the  development  of  vegetable-based  postharvest \ntechnologies in the CLV countries in 2005.3  \n \n3.  The proposed project will strengthen and further expand these previous efforts carried \nout under CLVNET. It was formulated based on close consultation with the GMS countries at \nworkshops  and  annual  review  meetings  in  conjunction  with  the  ongoing  Improving  Rural \nLivelihoods  through  Development  of  Vegetable-Based  Postharvest  Technologies  project \n(footnote 3) and the GMS Working Group on Agriculture. \n \nB.  Issues \n \n4.  Postharvest  losses  reduce  opportunities  for  exports  and  export  revenues,  and  are \nconsidered as key constraints to vegetable market development in the GMS countries. Studies \nconducted  under  Improving  Rural  Livelihoods  through  Development  of  Vegetable-Based \n                                                \n1 ADB. 1996.

Manila (Improving Rural Livelihoods through Development of Vegetable-Based \nPostharvest Technologies, TA 6208-REG, approved on 16 December). \n ", "20  Appendix 3 \nPostharvest Technologies project showed that the value of postharvest losses in vegetables is \nsubstantial. Annual losses for all vegetables together are estimated to value approximately \n$43 million in Lao PDR4 and $25 million in Cambodia.5 In Viet Nam, annual losses for tomato \nalone have been estimated to be close to $15 million.6 These losses are incurred at all stages of \nthe supply chain, but studies have shown that farmers suffered the most. Where vegetables are \nan important source of household cash income, as is often the case in regions where staple \ncrops are grown for subsistence only,7 a significant effect on rural incomes can be expected. \nTherefore,  reducing  postharvest  losses  in  vegetables  contributes  to  making  vegetable \nproduction more profitable for all supply chain agents, and to reducing rural poverty. In addition, \nprocessing vegetables extends the time window for marketing the harvested crop, serving to \nsmooth seasonal fluctuations in market prices, and increasing the potential consumer base \npopulation. Enhancing the supply of high quality year-round vegetables contributes to food \nsecurity and improved nutrition in the region. International trade is growing fast because of trade \nliberalization  and  market-oriented  reforms.  Likewise,  intraregional  trade  within  the  GMS  is \nexpanding.  Participation  in  international  markets  requires  sophisticated  marketing, \ntransportation  network  development,  and  information.  Successful  competition  also  requires \nensuring food safety, quality control, and commodity standardization. The proposed RETA will \nhelp address these needs.  \n \n5.  Under  the  Improving  Rural  Livelihoods  through  Development  of  Vegetable-Based \nPostharvest Technologies project, focus has been placed on supporting national agricultural \nresearch systems (NARSs) of CLV countries with basic infrastructure, equipment, and training \nof researchers to conduct postharvest experiments for priority vegetables. In addition, vegetable \nsupply chains were assessed to identify postharvest constraints for priority vegetable crops in \nperi-urban areas. Based on these studies, suggestions were made for the development of \npostharvest technologies for tomato and chili. Furthermore, technical and capacity building \nsupport has been provided for small-scale agro-processing enterprises.  \n \n6.  The proposed project will build on the strong regional interests and successes created \nby past and ongoing research and training activities, and expand on them in a number of ways. \nFirst, it will greatly strengthen pro-poor research efforts by shifting the current focus on peri-\nurban areas to poverty stricken upland areas. Until recently, small farmers have used sloping \nuplands mainly for subsistence farming. Gradually, more attention is being paid to improving the \nproductivity  and  sustainability  of  these  areas  to  meet  food  security  issues  and  improve \nlivelihoods of the upland population. Upland farming continues to be severely constrained by \ngaps in agricultural production processes and marketing of agricultural produce.8 Thousands of \nupland farmers and their value chain agents will be provided with training opportunities and \naccess  to  technologies  developed  under  the  ongoing  Improving  Rural  Livelihoods  through \nDevelopment of Vegetable-Based Postharvest Technologies project. \n \n                                                \n4  Genova II, Christian, Katinka Weinberger, Thongsavath Chanthasombath, Bouthsakone Inthalungdsee, Kham \nSanatem, and Kethongsa Somsak. 2006.

Second,  the  project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  NARSs  to  conduct  postharvest \nresearch by expanding into leafy vegetables, a group of priority vegetables that could not be \ndealt with under the ongoing project because of budget constraints. Studies conducted under \nthe ongoing project have shown that postharvest losses in fruit vegetables (such as tomato and \nchili) caused by fruit over-ripening, decay, and physical injuries remain high. As a consequence, \nfarmers\u2019 incomes remain low because of low farm gate prices, and retail prices remain high as \nthe  losses  are  passed  on  to  farmers  and  consumers.  This  is  true  even  though  improved \nvarieties with better shipping quality and shelf life and improved production systems have \nbecome  available.  Several  factors  contribute  to  postharvest  losses,  and  some  of  the \ntechnological  factors  include  faulty  harvesting  and  handling  practices,  poor  packaging  and \ntransport systems, lack of storage facilities, and lack of processing techniques. Similar factors \nare expected to hinder the development of successful value-added chains for leafy vegetables. \n \n8.  Finally, the project will expand regional experience-sharing and training activities to \ninclude all GMS countries. It will support regional training and experience-sharing programs, \ninvolving not only the CLV countries, but also Myanmar, Thailand, and Yunnan and Guangxi \nprovinces  of  the  PRC.  It  is  expected  that  effective  technologies  from  one  locale  may  be \nappropriately  extended  into  similar  locales  in  neighboring  GMS  countries  because  agro-\neconomic zones are comparable along the corridors of the Mekong Basin. By facilitating the \nparticipation  of  scientists  and  extension  workers  in  trainings,  workshops,  and  symposia, \ncooperation  across  GMS  countries  will  be  improved  and  limited  resources  for  agricultural \nresearch and dissemination will be used more efficiently. \n \nC.  The Technical Assistance \n \n  1.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  proposed  project  aims  to  contribute  toward  increasing  the  incomes  of  farmer \nhouseholds and reducing rural poverty, in particular of vegetable growers in upland rural areas \nof the GMS countries. The outcome of the project is an expansion of pro-poor agricultural \nresearch and dissemination, especially with regard to postharvest operations and processing \ntechnologies  for  vegetable  commodities.  Four  outputs  are  expected  from  the  project: \n(i) identification of market opportunities for value-added vegetables in poverty-stricken upland \nareas; (ii) technical training programs on postharvest handling, transporting, and processing; \n(iii) development  of  suitable,  low-cost  postharvest  and  processing  technologies  for  leafy \nvegetables; and (iv) strengthening of partnership among GMS countries.  \n \n  2.  Methodologies and Key Activities \n \n10.  AVRDC as the Executing Agency (EA) of the project will hold an inception workshop \nearly during project implementation to (i) define the details of the work program, (ii) develop the \nactivities together with the CLV national partners (Table A3.2), and (iii) ensure coordinated \nimplementation of activities among the GMS partners. The assessment of postharvest priorities \nwill be followed by the identification of suitable postharvest and processing technologies for a \nprioritized set of leafy vegetables. During project implementation, the proposed work program \nand outputs will be discussed regularly with key stakeholders in the GMS countries to ensure \ntheir effective participation in the planning and implementation of the project. Key activities for \nthe four outputs are described below. \n ", "22  Appendix 3 \na.  Identification  of  Market  Opportunities  in  Poverty-Stricken  Upland \nAreas \n \n11.  In close collaboration with the implementing agencies (IAs), the EA will:  \n \n(i)  identify market opportunities for vegetable value chains in CLV countries with \nparticular focus on poverty-stricken upland areas, and  \n(ii)  identify key strategies for improvement. \n \n12.  The  proposed  study  will  target  smallholder  vegetable  producers  in  poverty-stricken \nupland farming areas of the CLV countries. These areas will include Kampong Seam and Ba \nKoung districts in Cambodia; Van Viang and Kasy districts in Lao PDR; and Tam Nong, Lac \nThuy, Thanh Chuong, and A Luoi districts in Viet Nam. Until recently, sloping uplands have \nbeen used by small farmers for subsistence farming, but the focus is shifting to improved \nproductivity and sustainability of these areas to meet food security issues and livelihoods of the \nupland population. The diversity of biophysical regimes, biodiversity, and ethnic diversity in \nAsian uplands has led to a diverse range of upland farming systems. It is therefore crucial to \nidentify site and community-specific technologies and solutions to address problems of upland \nfarmers  and  farming.  This  study  will  aim  to  explore  the  relationship  between  site  and \ncommunity-specific technologies coupled with enhanced business economic organizations and \nupland farmers\u2019 increased bargaining power in the supply chain and sustainable agriculture.  \n \n13.  Using  a  participatory  and  interdisciplinary  approach,  the  study  will  identify  existing \nmarket opportunities in the upland areas, focusing on vegetable products which show strong \nmarket demand in terms of volume and price, and which are of interest to smallholders. In \naddition,  it  will  explore  existing  rural  cooperatives  and  associations,  and  the  level  of \ntechnologies related to small-scale agricultural production with low input requirements, irrigation, \nand water management. This study will work on the premise that, once the technological and \nrural business environment are well in place, upland farmers will have a steady income source \nthat will help reduce poverty and eventually lead to sustainable agriculture.  \n \nb.  Technical Training Programs on Postharvest Handling, Transporting, \nand Processing \n \n14.  In close collaboration with the IAs, the EA will \n \n(i)  identify specific postharvest and processing related training needs; \n(ii)  support the improvement of existing research infrastructure; \n(iii)  support the participation of scientists and extension workers in the intraregional \nworkshop, symposia, and training activities; \n(iv)  conduct training for trainers;  \n(v)  facilitate training of at least 2,000 farmers per CLV country; and \n(vi)  develop and translate training materials. \n \n15.  Experience from the Improving Rural Livelihoods through Development of Vegetable-\nBased  Postharvest  Technologies  project  has  shown  that  NARSs  lack  capacity  to  conduct \nvegetable postharvest research. While explicit postharvest research institutions exist, they may \nnot target horticultural crops. In the CLV countries, a training master plan will be developed in \ncollaboration with national stakeholders and regional experts from the research community and \nprivate sector\u2014to identify specific postharvest and processing related training and infrastructure \nneeds, with a particular focus on upland areas. Based on the outcomes of the training master \nplan, existing infrastructure will be further upgraded and equipment will be purchased to enable \ninstitutions to conduct postharvest research. \n ", "  Appendix 3  23 \n \n16.  Through  the  Improving  Rural  Livelihoods  through  Development  of  Vegetable-Based \nPostharvest Technologies project, AVRDC has developed a network of institutes in the region \nfrom which training courses for researchers and trainers are regularly conducted. The project \nwill continue these ongoing efforts to increase intraregional cooperation by using training as a \nmeans for an exchange of ideas and enhanced cooperation between the public and private \nsector. A special role in this respect is foreseen for the model small-scale processing enterprise \nbased in Lao PDR that is being supported under the ongoing project and which will serve as a \nplatform for training and exchange. For researchers, training will primarily take the form of \nparticipation in workshops, symposia, and short-term research internships in CLV countries with \ncapable institutions. Scientists from Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan in the PRC will be invited \nto participate in these activities.  \n \n17.  Curricula  for  training  of  trainers  will  focus  on  introducing  shipping/processing-type \nvarieties, improving field harvesting mechanisms, developing low-cost cooling facilities, adding \nvalue to vegetable products, introducing appropriate processing techniques, identifying markets, \nand managing micro-industries. The small-scale processing enterprise supported under the \nongoing project will play a crucial role in providing hands-on training activities. Within the \nsecond phase, it is expected to greatly upscale training activities to train at least 200 trainers per \ncountry and, subsequently, to at least 2,000 farmers per country. \n \n18.  The Improving Rural Livelihoods through Development of Vegetable-Based Postharvest \nTechnologies  project  has  identified  the  dire  need  of  training  material  in  local  languages. \nTherefore, the proposed project will continue to place emphasis on the translation of available \nand newly developed training materials into local languages. This will include the translation of \n\u201cSmall-Scale Postharvest Handling Practices: A Manual for Horticultural Crops\u201d9 into Burmese. \nOther materials developed during the ongoing project will also be translated. \n \nc.  Development  of  Suitable,  Low-Cost  Postharvest  and  Processing \nTechnologies for Leafy Vegetables \n \n19.  In close collaboration with the IAs, the EA will \n \n(i)  introduce  small-scale  postharvest  innovations  to  reduce  marketing  losses \n(storage, transport, handling, sanitation issues); and  \n(ii)  identify  and  introduce  candidate  vegetable  processing  opportunities \n(e.g., canning, pickling, dehydration, and sauces). \n \n20.  Similar  to  the  ongoing  research  under  the  Improving  Rural  Livelihoods  through \nDevelopment of Vegetable-Based Postharvest Technologies project, work will focus both on \npostharvest operations and processing opportunities. Because of fund limitations, only a limited \nnumber of technologies are currently covered. The proposed project will allow CLV countries to \nengage in the development of further technologies, in particular for leafy vegetable crops, while \nother GMS countries can benefit from technologies already developed in the CLV countries \nunder the ongoing project. Leafy vegetables to be considered are head cabbage and Chinese \nmustard  for  Lao PDR;  kang  kong  (water  convolvulus),  amaranth,  Chinese  kale,  and  leafy \ncucurbits  in  Viet  Nam;  and  Chinese  kale  and  cabbage  for  Cambodia.  Ongoing  research \nactivities will be expanded, including by using participatory approaches for the refinement of \n                                                \n9 Kitinoja, L., and A. A.

Technology development will take place in \nclose collaboration with the model small-scale processing enterprise that is being supported \nunder the ongoing project, and the private sector will further be involved in evaluating and \nproviding feedback on technologies and training. \n \nd.  Strengthening of Partnership among GMS Countries \n \n21.  The IAs will \n \n(i)  encourage and facilitate joint training and exchange of ideas at all levels of the \nproject, and  \n(ii)  conduct regular workshops and develop joint work plans. \n \n22.  Partnerships will be established and strengthened among various national universities, \norganizations,  research  institutes,  and  extension  agencies.  The  project  intends  to  include \nexperts and resource staff from all GMS countries and representatives both from the private and \npublic sector in the planning and training activities. Joint planning and priority-setting exercises, \ncoordinated  implementation  activities,  training  of  relevant  national  staff,  exchange  of \nexperiences, and easy access to a shared database that collects data from the participating \ncountries  will  strengthen  cross-border  partnerships  and  economic  cooperation  in  the \npostharvest sector.  \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n \n23.  The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at $675,000 (Table A3.1). ADB will \nfinance  $500,000,  or  74%  of  the  project.  The  remaining  cost  will  be  covered  by  AVRDC \n($155,000, or 23% of the cost) and by the governments of the CLV countries through their \nrespective NARSs ($20,000, or 3% of the cost). ADB funds will mainly be used to finance the \nproject\u2019s operational costs, monitoring, and coordination. In-kind contribution by AVRDC and the \nNARSs will be used to support personnel, facilities, equipment, and other goods and services. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  AVRDC will be the EA for the project, and the NARSs identified in Table A3.2 will be \ndesignated the IAs. AVRDC will appoint a project team coordinator from within its staff. Each \ncollaborating NARS will also appoint a country team coordinator for its component of the work. \nNational teams will be responsible for specific research, and technology transfer in the field. For \nthe other GMS countries, the coordinators of the Working Group on Agriculture will act as focal \npoints and nominate people for participation in training programs and workshops. Research \nsubcontracts will be signed between AVRDC and CLV countries.  \n \n25.  The project will be implemented over 36 months, from January 2007 to December 2009. \nThe detailed work plan will be finalized in the inception workshop that will take place within \n3 months of the start of the project. The steering committee formed under the Improving Rural \nLivelihoods through Development of Vegetable-Based Postharvest Technologies project will \ncontinue to be operational. The EA will also organize annual planning and review meetings and \na project completion workshop in the third quarter of the third year, which will be attended by all \nproject partners, including ADB. The project completion workshop will be held to review project \nachievements and outline the strategy to ensure continuity of the selection and dissemination \nactivities beyond the project. The workshop will recommend sustainable approaches to ensure \nthe continuity of the improvement programs that will have been initiated. \n ", "  Appendix 3  25 \nTable A3.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \n \nItem      Total Cost \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  In September 2000, heads of state adopted the Millennium Declaration confirming their \ncountries\u2019 commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a set of eight \ngoals for addressing the many dimensions of extreme poverty. The first goal aims at eradicating \npoverty and hunger by reducing by half between 1990 and 2015 the proportion of people \nsuffering from hunger, and living on less than $1 a day.  \n \n2.  While significant efforts are being made for achieving the hunger and poverty MDG, \nprogress to date has been limited in most of the world, with the notable exception of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). From 1990 to 2001, the PRC halved the proportion of its \npopulation living in poverty from 33% to 17%, lifting over 160 million people out of poverty. \nHowever, during this period, the rest of the world experienced an increase in the number of poor \npeople from 844 million to 877 million. During this same period, the PRC significantly reduced \nthe number of hungry people from 194 million to 142 million, whereas in the rest of the world the \nnumber increased from 625 million to 672 million. Thus, there are serious concerns whether the \nhunger and poverty MDG will be met. \n \n3.  In 1993, concerned about global food security, the International Food Policy Research \nInstitute (IFPRI) launched the 2020 Vision for Food, Agriculture, and the Environment. It has two \nprimary objectives: (i) to develop and promote a shared vision and consensus for action for \nmeeting  food  needs  while  reducing  poverty  and  the  environment;  and  (ii)  to  generate \ninformation  and  encourage  debate  to  influence  action  by  national  government  and \nnongovernment organizations, the private sector, international development institutions, and \nother elements of civil society. The 2020 Vision Initiative fully supports the MDGs and seeks to \ncontribute to their achievement by 2015.  \n \n4.  To  realize  its  objectives,  the  2020  Vision  Initiative  engages  in  different  activities, \nincluding generating timely, state-of-the-art information on key topics related to food, agriculture, \nand the environment; raising public awareness of the world\u2019s food and environmental problems \nand what can be done to solve them; and providing for a multi-stakeholder dialogue, information \nsharing,  and  consensus  building  among  policy  makers,  researchers,  and  leaders  in \nnongovernment  organizations,  private  sector,  and  media  through  seminar,  workshops,  and \nconferences. In this connection, major global conferences that have significantly influenced \npolicy debate and policy making were held by IFPRI, including most notably: (i) the conference \non \u201cSustainable Food Security for All by 2020\u201d in Bonn, Germany in 2001, which helped to \nfurther knowledge on emerging developments and priority actions required to assure global food \nsecurity and, by attracting participation from all stakeholder groups and facilitating different \nperspectives  to  be  heard,  encouraged  dialogue  and  debate  between  traditional  and  new \nstakeholders; and (ii) the conference on \u201cAssuring Food and Nutrition Security in Africa by 2020\u201d \nin Kampala, Uganda in 2004, which helped to putting African food and nutrition security on the \nagenda  and  informed  and  contributed  to  key  Africa-focused  processes  such  as  the  New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development, the Blair Commission on Africa, the G8 deliberations in \n ", "  Appendix 4  29 \n2004 and 2005, and the World Economic Forum Global Governance Initiative Poverty and \nHunger Expert Group.1 \n \n5.  Building on the foundation of these conferences and other work carried out under the \n2020 Vision Initiative, the proposed project will help IFPRI in promoting the next round of multi-\nstakeholder  international  dialogue  on  new  strategies  and  actions  for  reducing  hunger  and \npoverty and, in particular, focus on the corresponding role of agriculture and rural development \nin Asia. The project was formulated based on close collaboration with the State Council Leading \nGroup Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development (LGOPAD) of the PRC. \n \n6.  The project also builds on experience with mechanisms for policy dialogue in South Asia \ngathered  under  the  Poverty  Reduction  through  Advisory  Network,  Policy  Research,  and \nCapacity Strengthening in South Asia project2 which strengthened the capacity of local research \ninstitutions, supported quality research in collaboration with them, and linked policy makers and \npolicy researchers to facilitate more rational and effective decision making on reducing hunger \nand poverty. It was recognized that there continues to be a need from both researchers and \ndecision makers for suitable mechanisms of interaction, and for high quality research that \ninforms the design and implementation of appropriate policies and programs to create an impact \non poverty reduction through policy changes. \n \nB.  Issues \n \n7.  Hunger and poverty remain widespread in Asia. Despite recent progress, especially in \nthe PRC, Asia continues to be home to two thirds of the world\u2019s absolutely poor and food-\ninsecure people. About 650 million people in Asia are absolutely poor, living on less than $1 a \nday, down from 934 million in 1990. Around 520 million people lack sufficient access to food to \nlead healthy, productive lives, down from 570 million in 1990. There are also indications that the \nnature of hunger and poverty in Asia is changing. The hungry and poor that are \u201ceasy\u201d to reach \nare benefiting from global efforts to reduce hunger and poverty. However, the poorest of the \npoor are often much harder to reach because they may live in failing states or are caught in \npoverty  traps.  The  power  of  economic  growth  for  poverty  reduction  and  hunger  reduction \nappears to have diminished in recent years. A growing number of countries combine good \neconomic growth with disappointing declines or even rises in poverty. It is increasingly evident \nthat the policy mix for the reduction of poverty and hunger needs to change, and policies for pro-\npoor growth need to be rebalanced with social protection policies if the poverty and hunger \nMDG is to be met. A 2004 review of the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) noted an impressive record in reducing income poverty in the Asia and Pacific \nregion,  but  also  pointed  out  that  the  least  progress  has  been  made  in  the  non-income \ndimensions of poverty, and that the region faces a number of challenges in attaining the MDGs.3 \n \n8.  There is also a growing concern that even if the first MDG is achieved, it would only \nhalve  the  proportion  of  people  living  on  less  than  $1  a  day  and  suffering  from  hunger. \n                                                \n1  Related to these events was the conference on \u201cScaling up Poverty Reduction\u201d hosted by the Government of the \nPRC in Shanghai in 2004, and sponsored by the World Bank in cooperation with other development partners, \nincluding ADB. It was part of a global learning process which drew lessons from case studies and multi-country \ninteractive dialogues with a view of replicating or upscaling best practices in order to further poverty reduction and \nachievement of the MDGs.  \n2  ADB. 2002.

Enhancing the Fight against Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the \nAsian Development Bank. Manila. \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nProjections suggest that worldwide an estimated 700 million people will remain extremely poor \nin 2015, and about 600 million will still go hungry. About half of the people projected to remain \nabsolutely poor or food-insecure in 2015 will be living in Asia. The Millennium Project\u2019s report \nstates that the goals are only a mid-station to ending absolute poverty by 2025, and that \nsustained support is required for those who will still require support.  \n \n9.  Therefore, there is a compelling need to think ahead, and for policy and decision makers, \ndevelopment partners, civil society organizations, and researchers to (i) take stock of progress \nin achieving the poverty and poverty MDG and those who are left behind; (ii) assess why hunger \nand poverty persist in these groups; (iii) analyze cases where interventions, in particular in the \nagriculture and rural development sector, have or have not successfully reached the poorest of \nthe poor and those most afflicted by hunger; (iv) assess the optimal mix of pro-poor growth and \nsocial  protection  policies  at  different stages  of  development; (v)  intensify  the  exchange  of \nlessons between the PRC and other countries that have been successfully reducing hunger and \npoverty on the one hand and the rest of the countries on the other hand; and (vi) develop a \nconsensus on strategies and actions to achieve food and nutrition security and reduce poverty \nand its consequences for these groups.  \n \n10.  IFPRI and LGOPAD jointly plan to facilitate a multi-stakeholder international dialogue on \nnew strategies and actions to attain the hunger and poverty MDG, and to effectively go beyond \nit and ultimately end poverty and hunger. This dialogue will culminate in a global conference, \nprovisionally titled \u201cHalving Hunger and Poverty is not enough: New Strategies and Actions \nbeyond the Millennium Development Goals\u201d, which will be held in Beijing in the fourth quarter of \n2007\u2014half-way between 2000, when the Millennium Declaration was adopted, and 2015 when \nthe MDGs are planned to be achieved. Convening the conference in the PRC will facilitate \nlearning from the lessons of that country\u2019s successes in sharply reducing poverty and hunger \nand achieving the MDG well in advance of the target, and from the PRC\u2019s increasing shift in \nattention toward closing the gaps and going beyond the MDG. Few of the MDG-related events \nover the past 5 years have considered those left implicitly behind by the MDG process\u2014the \nother  half.  Most  of  these  events  have  focused  more  on  identifying  the  problems  than  on \neffective solutions and their implementation. The proposed multi-stakeholder dialogue will bring \nto bear the latest research on new strategies and actions to end hunger and poverty for those \nprobably not reached by the MDGs. \n \nC.  The Technical Assistance \n \n  1.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  proposed  project  aims  to  contribute  toward  increasing  incomes  of  farmer \nhouseholds and reducing rural poverty and hunger in Asia. The outcome will be improved policy \nmaker and public awareness of appropriate strategies and actions to achieve the hunger and \npoverty MDG and go beyond to ultimately end hunger and poverty. Knowledge and information \nemerging from the project will be fed into key policy and decision making processes in order to \nadjust existing strategies and policies and develop new ones. IFPRI will communicate the \nproject  outcomes  to  leading  national,  regional,  and  global  policy  and  decision  makers. \nFurthermore, IFPRI expects that high-level participants from the public, civil, and private sector \nfrom at least half of the developing member countries (DMCs) actively participating in the \nprocess supported by the project will help share and institutionalize the outcomes, beginning \nwith  seminars  and  media  briefings  in  their  respective  countries.  These  knowledge  and \ninformation flows are expected to help improve the design and implementation of strategies and \nactions for reducing hunger and poverty, and contribute to greater development effectiveness of \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nsuch  interventions.  IFPRI  will  monitor  the  spread  and  influence  of  these  knowledge  and \ninformation flows through media reports, policy documents, and other devices. \n \n12.  The project is expected to generate four outputs: (i) the knowledge base on international \nexperience with strategies and actions for reducing and ending hunger and poverty is improved; \n(ii) a high-level policy forum on the role of agriculture and rural development in alleviating \nhunger and poverty is held at ADB; (iii) a global conference on \u201cHalving Hunger and Poverty is \nnot enough: New Strategies and Actions beyond the MDGs,\u201d including an Asia Forum, is \nconvened in Beijing; and (iv) follow-up strategic briefings are held at ADB and key Asian \ninstitutions. \n \n  2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Key activities for the four outputs are described below. \n \na.  Knowledge  Base  on International  Experience with  Strategies  and \nActions for Reducing and Ending Hunger and Poverty \n \n14.  To set the stage and facilitate the multi-stakeholder international dialogue, IFPRI as the \nexecuting agency of the project will commission 3\u20134 background research papers, 6\u20138 policy \nbriefs, and other information materials from leading experts. Topics addressed will include \n(i) evaluation of progress in achieving the hunger and poverty MDG; (ii) assessment of who are \nthe poor and food insecure who are left behind or out of MDG processes, where they are, and \nwhy hunger and poverty persist among these groups; (iii) review of the experience with key \nstrategies and actions to reduce poverty and hunger and of the trade-offs between pro-poor \npolicies and social protection policies; and (iv) review of lessons from innovations, experiments, \nand interventions\u2014what worked, what did not work, how successes could be scaled up and \nspeeded up, and what lessons have been learned from experiences across countries (including \nfrom the PRC\u2019s success in significantly reducing poverty as well as from the economic history of \nindustrialized countries; and from across sectors, including the public and private sectors). \nSpecial efforts will be made to draw on ADB\u2019s vast depository of materials.  \n \nb.  High-Level  Policy  Forum  on  the  Role  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment in Alleviating Hunger and Poverty \n \n15.  A high-level policy forum will be convened at ADB in the third quarter of 2007 focused on \none of the most central issues on the poverty reduction agenda in Asia\u2014the role of agriculture \nand rural development in alleviating hunger and poverty. While the specifics of the program will \nbe developed in consultation with ADB, it is envisioned that the policy forum will span 1\u20132 days. \nAbout 30\u201340 leaders/stakeholders in the public sector, civil society, private sector, research and \nacademia, and media and from across ADB\u2019s DMCs will be invited. The RETA will support the \nparticipation of about 15 leaders/stakeholders from DMCs. Background papers will be prepared \nfor the policy forum, and executive-style proceedings will be compiled subsequently. \n \n    c.  Global Conference Including an Asia Forum \n \n16.  The global conference on \u201cHalving Hunger and Poverty is not enough: New Strategies \nand Actions beyond the Millennium Development Goals\u201d will be held in Beijing in the fourth \nquarter of 2007. While the specific content and themes of the international conference are still to \nbe fully developed, particularly in conjunction with the conference advisory committee (para. 22), \nthe following are expected to be addressed: \n \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n  (i)  Who represents those left behind from the MDGs? \n  (ii)  Why are these groups in such a perennial state of poverty and hunger?  \n(iii)  Do policies follow the right approaches and strategies to reach them? Are there \npolicies that should be intensified or whose scope should be broadened or whose \nsequencing should be revisited? What is the appropriate way to phase poverty \nreduction  strategies?  Are  there  different  modalities  for  reaching  those  left \nbehind? What are the best practices to draw upon? To what extent and how do \npro-poor policies need to be rebalanced with social protection policies? What is \nthe optimal mix of growth and social protection policies at different stages of \ndevelopment? With the poor and food-insecure primarily concentrated in rural \nareas and depending directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods, \nspecial attention will be paid to agricultural and rural development policies and \nstrategies. The transformation of smallholder agriculture is a prime item on the \ndevelopment  agenda  for  many  developing  countries.  This  transformation  will \ndirectly affect about 2 billion people worldwide on about 350 million farms that \nare less than 2 hectares in size. A strategic agenda to manage that complex \ntransition and incorporate opportunities for agricultural innovation will be called \nfor in order to end hunger and poverty.  \n(iv)  What are the implications of new technologies for poverty reductions?  \n(v)  What lessons have been learned from experiences across countries, including \ndeveloped and developing countries? \n(vi)  What roles should government, civil society, and the private sector play, and \nwhat responsibilities do they have? What could be the appropriate schedule of \nnational and international action?  \n \n17.  The conference will span 3 days. It will be conducted in both plenary and parallel \nsessions. Besides thematic sessions, regional forums\u2014including an Asia Forum\u2014will also be \norganized. It is envisioned that around 300\u2013500 participants from Asia and the rest of the world \nwill  participate.  They  will  represent  major  disciplines,  including  the  agriculture, \nenvironment/natural resources, nutrition, health, social sciences, political science, economics, \nfinance, and trade.
