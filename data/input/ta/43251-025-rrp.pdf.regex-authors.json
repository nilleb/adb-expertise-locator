I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  from  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  ordinary  capital  resources  (A-loan)  and  (ii)  a \nproposed loan funded through the participation of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (B-loan), both \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Metropolitan Sanitation Management Investment Project. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Indonesia in the improvement of urban \nwastewater services in the cities of Cimahi, Jambi, Makassar, Palembang, and Pekanbaru, \nwhich currently lack any piped sewerage and wastewater treatment facilities. The project will \nrespond to the needs of urban communities (including low-income households) by constructing \nnew separate sewerage systems and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), setting up local \nwastewater  infrastructure  management  institutions,  and  strengthening  the  relevant  regional \ngovernment departments.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Indonesia has one of the lowest coverage rates of conventional off-site urban sewerage \nin Asia. Only 11 out of its 330 cities have partial sewerage systems, and only 2% of the national \nurban population is connected to central WWTPs; the remaining urban population depends on \npoorly  constructed  and  maintained  septic  tanks  and  unlined  pit  latrines,  which  result  in \nleachates penetrating the aquifers. Some 80% of gray water drains directly to surface waters.2 \nThe present sanitation services are inadequate and unintegrated, due to inadequate and poorly \nenforced regulations. This results in limited desludging of septic tanks, inadequate septage \ntreatment facilities, and fragmented operational responsibility.3 Improved access to safe water \nand  basic  sanitation  is  part  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  effort  to  achieve  its  2015 \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) targets.4 While the government\u2019s MDG reports suggest \nthat good progress has been achieved with respect to sanitation, in practice the available \nfacilities are substandard, and rely on unsustainable septage removal and treatment facilities.5 \nAs a result, there is significant environmental pollution, widespread contamination of surface \nand  groundwater  with  the  associated  spread  of  water-related  diseases,6 and  high  infant \nmortality.7 The  inadequate  sanitation systems  and their  resulting  environmental  and  health \nimpacts produce economic opportunity losses of about $5.6 billion annually, equivalent to 2.3% \nof the country\u2019s gross domestic product.8 These issues can be solved by the introduction of (i) \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  \u201cGray water\u201d is wastewater originating from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing. \n3   Septage refers to the liquid sludge removed from septic tanks that needs to be treated and disposed safely. \n4  Specifically, 75.3% of the urban population has sustainable access to an improved water supply by 2015, and \n76.8% of urban households have sustainable access to basic sanitation by 2015. \n5  Ministry of National Development Planning/National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2012.

Project sites. The project\u2019s target areas are the most densely populated districts of five \ncities. Cimahi, located in the province of Central Java, has a population of 617,000 (2012). The \ncurrent sanitation facilities in Cimahi are limited to septic tanks, pit latrines, and public toilets. \nAbout 30% of the population lacks access to any sanitation facility, and disposes of waste \ndirectly to open drains and rivers. Many residents suffer from waterborne diseases. Jambi, \nlocated in the province of Central Sumatra, has a population of 558,500 (2010); 6% of the \npopulation does not have a toilet. In general, wastewater is disposed through septic tanks from \nwhich polluted effluent is discharged into open drains or directly to the surrounding paddy fields. \nMakassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province, has a population of about 1.4 million (2011). \nSanitation facilities comprise individual septic tanks, three small bore sewerage systems with \nsewage treatment, and one septage treatment plant. Open defecation is still a major health \nproblem in the Losari area of Makassar.9 Palembang, the capital of South Sumatra province, \nhas a population of 1.47 million (2009); 69% of the population use septic tanks, about 4% use \npit latrines, and the remaining 27% lack access to basic sanitation. The city has a single \nseptage treatment facility. Pekanbaru, the capital of Riau province, has a population of 1.29 \nmillion (2012). There is neither a centralized sewerage system nor communal septic tanks in the \ncity, and most residents rely on individual pit latrines and septic tanks. Open defecation is widely \npracticed.  \n \n5.  Sector  issues. A central government assessment summarizes the urban sanitation \nsector in Indonesia as lacking an adequate regulatory framework, suffering from fragmented \ninstitutional involvement, lacking local government resources to provide public services, and \nlacking community awareness of sanitation issues. 10 Although the responsibility for supplying \nand managing improved sanitation has been devolved to local governments, their capacity to \nensure that the necessary systems are in place and operating effectively is limited. ADB is \ncurrently implementing the Metropolitan Sanitation Management and Health Project (MSMHP), \nwhich finances urban sanitation in Medan and Yogyakarta cities, and is complemented by \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) to strengthen institutions.11 To support the \ngovernment\u2019s plan for sanitation, the project will continue the MSMHP work with new sewerage \nsystem developments in cities that lack sewerage systems.  \n \n6.  Related policies and strategies. The proposed project supports (i) the implementation \nof the government's Road Map for Acceleration of Urban Sanitation Development, 2010\u20132014, \nwhich  targets  sewerage  systems  in  16  cities  and  the  implementation  of  community-based \nsanitation in all other cities; (ii) the ADB\u2019s Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Assessment;12 \n(iii) ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which aims to improve wastewater treatment \nand management in developing member countries;13 and (iv) ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, \n2012\u20132020 to promote environmentally sustainable green cities.14 In particular, the project will \n                                                \n9  Losari has a population of 214,000 (2009). \n10  Ministry of National Development Planning/National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2010.

At sector level, the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) sets the national policy and strategy \nfor wastewater systems development, which aims for (i) increased sanitation coverage, giving \npriority to the poor; (ii) an increased role for the community and the private sector in sanitation \noperation and management; (iii) development of a regulatory framework for urban sanitation; \n(iv) capacity  building  for  wastewater  management;  and  (v)  increased  investment,  including \ndevelopment  of  alternative  funding  sources  for  wastewater  infrastructure.  This  will  be  the \nsecond  wastewater  project  under  the  Government's  Roadmap  to  Acceleration  of  Urban \nSanitation Development, after the MSMHP. ADB is a key agency supporting this initiative. \n \n8.  Lessons. A review of the outcome of urban sanitation projects in Indonesia indicates \nthat  local  ownership  is  fundamental  to  sustainability.  Facilities  provided  by  the  central \ngovernment without local involvement are mismanaged, ineffective or abandoned over time. \nLocal governments will be represented in this project\u2019s implementation unit (PIU), and fully \nparticipate  in  project  procurement  and  management  to  ensure  strong  project  ownership. \nLessons from the implementation of the MSMHP and other urban projects will be taken into \naccount, specifically experience from procurement activities and the benefits of micro-marketing \ntechniques to raise public awareness regarding the importance of good sanitation.  \n \n9.  Special  features. The project will pursue improved planning and implementation of \nsewerage and wastewater treatment facilities with cofinancing from the ASEAN Infrastructure \nFund,16 and collaborative cofinancing from the Government of Australia.17 The project will be \nsupported by TA for the creation of autonomous institutions, within local authorities, through \ncapacity  development,  the  implementation  of  regulations  governing  the  sewerage  service \ndelivery, and awareness-raising of the importance of good sanitation practices and the benefits \nof public sewerage systems.18  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project will be the reduced pollutant discharges to the environment in \nthe participating cities (Cimahi, Jambi, Makassar, Palembang, and Pekanbaru). The outcome \nwill be the increased connection of the population to improved wastewater services in the \nparticipating cities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will have two outputs:  \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Indonesia, 2012\u20132014.

These systems will be directly \nfunded by local government budgets. \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Project implementation support institutionalized. The capacity of \nthe executing and implementing agencies will be strengthened through provision \nof  management  support  and  training  in  (i)  procurement  and  construction \nsupervision; and (ii) design and commissioning of sewerage systems. TA for \ninstitutional  development  and  management  and  capacity  building  support  for \nsustainability  will  be  implemented  separately  (footnote  18). This  will  include \ndevelopment by the government of public sanitation awareness campaigns that \nseek  to  build  appreciation  and  understanding  of  the  benefits  of  sewerage \nsystems and the need for adequate charges to ensure that they remain fully \noperational and correctly maintained. \n \nD.

The economic feasibility25 of the subprojects was evaluated, based on the following \nbenefits: (i) health impact in terms of health care costs and productivity savings; (ii) economic \nopportunity loss; (iii) obviated costs of constructing and desludging septic tanks; (iv) willingness \nto  pay  for  sewerage  management  services;  and  (v)  increased  economic  opportunities, \nemployment creation, and poverty reduction as a result of the cities\u2019 improved livability and \nattractiveness  to  businesses.  Under  the  anticipated  project  best-case  scenario,  all  five \nsubprojects are economically feasible, with economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) above the \nminimum  12.0%  threshold.  Sensitivity  tests  show  that  all  subprojects  remain  economically \nfeasible given a (i) 10% increase in investment cost, (ii) 10.0% increase in O&M cost, or (iii) a \n10.0% reduction in total benefits. A 1-year delay in economic benefits for Jambi reduces its \nEIRR to slightly below the benchmark. Under a worst-case scenario (a simultaneous 10% \nincrease in investment and O&M costs, combined with a 10.0% reduction in total benefits), the \nEIRRs for the Cimahi and Palembang subprojects fall slightly below the 12.0% threshold; the \nEIRR for Pekanbaru drops to 10.9%, and for Jambi to 10.7%. All subprojects are very sensitive \nto reductions in total benefits, followed closely by increased investment. \n \n19.  The financial analysis26 addresses the: (i) financial viability of the proposed subprojects; \n(ii) affordability of proposed wastewater fees; and (iii) sustainability of the proposed subprojects \nand availability of a subsidy from the respective city governments, where necessary.27 The \nCimahi, Jambi, Makassar, and Pekanbaru subprojects will be funded by debt undertaken by the \ncentral government, with the assets subsequently transferred to the cities. These four cities will \ncommit to implementing tariffs (which will apply to all connected households and commercial \nestablishments) as soon as the systems are completely operational, to ensure the recovery of \nO&M costs through collection of wastewater fees. In most cases, the tariffs necessary to cover \nO&M costs were below the respondents\u2019 willingness to pay. For all five cities, the proposed \nwastewater  fees  are  about  0.15%\u20131.0%  of  average  household  income,  below  the  2.0% \naffordability threshold.  \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  The MPW has implemented several water supply and sanitation projects funded by \nmultilateral  institutions,  which  has  given  them  experience  in  financial  management,  fund \ndisbursement,  and  procurement  of  civil  works  and  consultancy  services.  The  capacity \ndevelopment TA will help strengthen the capacity of the PIU and project management unit staff \nin each city to carry out project-related tasks.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MPW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 23). \n \n                                                \n25  Economic analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 A subsidy will be required in Cimahi and Pekanbaru for the first 2 years. \n ", "8   \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  The project is classified as an MDG-targeted intervention. The project will have positive \nsocial  impacts  through  reduction  of  the  high  incidence  of  water-related  diseases,  and  will \nimprove the quality of life in urban communities. It promotes inclusive development through \nsubsidies  for  the  domestic  connections  and  monthly  wastewater  fees  of  poor  households, \nhouseholds headed by women, as well as the sick and disabled. Measures will be taken to help \nexpand  sewerage  connections  and  sustain  behavioral  change  through  joint  stakeholder \nplanning on hygiene and environmental management.  \n \n23.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. It will benefit women by \nimplementing a gender action plan28 (30% of capacity building recipients at community and \ninstitutional levels will be women); similar quotas are set for consultations and in sanitation \npromotion, as well as in job opportunities in sanitation management through female recruitment. \nA national gender and social development specialist will support the PIUs to ensure that the \ngender action plan is fully implemented.  \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n24.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Resettlement plans29 have been prepared for \neach of the subprojects (Cimahi, Palembang, and Pekanbaru) that involve land acquisition; a \ntotal of 32.397 hectares will be acquired, with 63 households (240 persons) affected. The \nPekanbaru subproject will have significant impacts, with 22 households (97 persons) losing \nmore than 10% of their productive land. Palembang will have 24 households (75 persons) \nrequiring relocation. Due diligence reports for Jambi and Makassar have been prepared, and \nland acquisition for these subprojects was carried out in accordance with the provisions of \nprevailing  local  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009);  no \ncorrective action plans or resettlement plans are considered necessary for Jambi and Makassar. \nAll other impacts are partial and temporary. The total land acquisition and resettlement cost is \nestimated at $9.502 million (including base costs, allowances, and contingencies). A cutoff date \nwas established with stakeholder consultations.30 Information was disclosed to affected persons \nthroughout project preparation, with a public information booklet distributed in February 2013. \n \n25.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  No  indigenous  peoples  will  be  affected  by  the \nsubprojects. Land to be acquired is not part of any ancestral domain. Field investigations \nconducted in the project area failed to reveal the existence of any indigenous peoples or ethnic \nminorities.  \n \n26.  Environment  (category  B).  Initial  environmental  examinations31 were  conducted  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government  regulations. \nStakeholder consultations were conducted from May to November 2012. Issues raised during \nthe consultation are addressed in the environmental management plans (EMPs). Subprojects \nwill not cause irreversible environmental impacts. The EMPs include mitigation measures and \ncost estimates for their implementation.  The EMPs will be updated at the detailed design stage; \nonce approved by ADB, they will form part of the contract bidding documents. Implementation of \nthe EMPs will be enforced by an environment officer in the local project management unit.

Adverse impacts during operation \nwill be minimized by specified O&M procedures and environmental monitoring.  \n \n27.  In  compliance  with  the  Environmental  Protection  and  Management  Law,  2009,  an \nAnalisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan (environmental impact assessment [AMDAL])\u2014will be \nprepared by the detailed engineering design consultant for each subproject.  AMDALs will be \nfunded by the Government of Australia through the Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative in Cimahi, \nMakassar, and Palembang at the detailed engineering design stage and by local governments \nin Jambi and Pekanbaru after detailed engineering design. The government environmental \npermits and approvals for construction will be obtained before the award of civil works contracts.  \n \n28.  Disclosure. Resettlement and environment documents were prepared in consultation \nwith local communities and are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nIndonesian laws and regulations. The documents have been endorsed, approved and posted on \nthe ADB website. A grievance redress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints \nregarding project performance. The resettlement plans, initial environmental examinations, and \nEMPs will be updated and disclosed after detailed design and cleared by ADB prior to contract \nawards.  \n \nF.
