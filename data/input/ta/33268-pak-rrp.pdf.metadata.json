Activities  include  establishing \nsustainable  productive  technologies  with  arrested \nenvironmental and resource degradation through integrated \nresource  management,  including  agriculture  and  livestock \nproduction,  and  farm  and  community  forestry.  New \nconstruction  and  upgrading  of  existing  infrastructure  for \nproduction, water consumption, and transportation represent \nsignificant aspects of the Project. Project management will \noperate closely with government line departments and the \nProject will be implemented through community participation \nto  improve  community  involvement  in  designing  and \nimplementing  project  interventions.  Capacity-building \ninitiatives,  as  well  as  training  in  community  organization, \nstrengthened  project  management  skills,  and  improved \ninstitutional  capabilities  for  line  departments  to  better \naddress the needs of the poorer segments of the society are \nimportant project activities. \n   \nRationale  Poor  and  inefficient  management  of  available  natural \nresources  contribute  to  the  pervasive  poverty  in  the \nFederally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The poor farm \nand livestock productivity, and consequent poverty, restrains \ntransition from below-subsistence livelihoods. Capacity and \nthe ability to explore other opportunities are restricted by \npoor access to productive and physical infrastructure. The \ndegradation of the physical environment, if not checked, will \nworsen the situation.  \n ", "iv \nImpact and Outcome  The Project is designed to improve the productive potential \nof selected micro-watersheds and their associated natural \nresource  base;  and  to  strengthen  the  planning, \nimplementation,  and  management  capacity  of  the  target \ncommunities and implementing departments in the project \narea.  This  will  be  accomplished  by  improving  community \ninfrastructure  for  production  and  communication; \nestablishing  effective  and  broad-based  community \norganizations  focused  on  development;  increasing \nproduction  from  renewable  natural  resources;  and \nstrengthening agency-based planning, implementation, and \ncapacity for improved service delivery to communities.   \n \nProject Investment Plan  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $60.4  million \nequivalent.  The  Government  will  provide  $15.4  million \nequivalent, or 25% of the project cost. Project beneficiaries \nwill contribute $3.0 million equivalent, or 5% of the project \ncost through labor and other in-kind inputs. \n   \nFinancing Plana  ($ million) \n    Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange Currency  Cost  Percent \nADB  11.4  30.6  42.0  70.0\nGovernment    15.4  15.4  25.0\nBeneficiaries    3.0  3.0  5.0\nTotal 11.4  49.0  60.4  100.0\n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Since the project, including its cost estimates, was prepared and agreed \nwith the Government prior to the issuance of the staff instructions on \nCost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for ADB Financing, the \nRRP distinguishes between foreign and local cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of \n$42.0 million from its Special Funds resources. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project Completion  30 June 2011 \nDate \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of States and Frontier Regions \n \nImplementing Agency  The Governor's Secretariat (FATA) \n ", "v \nImplementation Arrangements  Project  implementation  arrangements  follow  a  partly \ndecentralized  approach:  (i)  a  Peshawar-based  project \nmanagement  unit,  under  the  management  of  a  project \ndirector, will coordinate project-related activities, consolidate \nwork  plans,  award  procurement  contracts,  recruit \nconsultants, perform monitoring and evaluation, supervise \nconsultants and contractors, and manage project finances; \nand  (ii)  agency-based  project  implementation  units  will \nprepare work plans, coordinate amongst line departments, \naward  procurement  contracts,  assist  with  supervision  of \nconsultants,  assist  with  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \nmanage finances. A project manager will head each project \nimplementation  unit.  Consultants,  contracted  technical \nservices,  and  line  departments  will  provide  requisite \ntechnical support. \n \nProcurement  Requisite  goods,  works,  and  services  will  be  procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works \nrelated to the community infrastructure component will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures or other procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nConsulting Services  A  total  of  147  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising  21  person-months  of  international  and  126 \nperson-months of domestic consultant inputs, will support \nproject implementation. In addition, service contracts will be \nawarded to undertake certain specialized project activities. \nThe  Government  will  engage  consulting  services  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nthe engagement of domestic consultants. Quality-and cost-\nbased selection procedures will be used in recruiting the \nconsultants.  \n \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  generate  significant  quantifiable  and \nBeneficiaries  nonquantifiable  benefits.  Effective  implementation  of  the \nProject  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  household  incomes. \nFarm and livestock packages will increase the productivity of \nabout 52,500 hectares on rain-fed (barani) lands and benefit \naround  37,500  households.  It  will  also  strengthen  food \nsecurity and improve the nutritional status of farm families. \n ", "vi \n  The  integrated  approach  involves  the  complementary \nmanagement  of  natural  resources,  agriculture,  and  range \nmanagement. Effective forestry and range management will \nensure  water  harvesting  and  recharge  of  groundwater \nresources,  check  soil  erosion,  and  provide  forage  and \nfoliage to livestock. The construction and rehabilitation of \nirrigation  and  small-scale  water  storage  structures  will \nensure  the  availability  of  irrigation  and  drinking  water \nsupplies. Improved farming and livestock rearing practices \nand  additional  income  from  rehabilitation  of  the  natural \nenvironment  are  livelihood  strategies  that  will  be  made \navailable for the benefit of individual households. The target \npopulation will obtain access to opportunities for improving \ntheir livelihoods, broaden their networks of knowledge and \ncontacts with service providers, and learn more productive \nfarming practices with all the community sharing access to \nnew and improved supporting infrastructure. \n \nRisks and Assumptions   Key  assumptions  are  that  (i)  the  project  area  remains \naccessible  vis-\u00e0-vis  security  and  for  development;  (ii) \npolitical administrations will provide positive support; (iii) the \nsociocultural  system  accepts  the  poverty  reduction  focus \nand  participatory  approach,  which  is  critical  to  project \nsuccess; and (iv) the agency-based technical departments \nand communities are willing to adopt the watershed planning \napproach.  The  Project  also  assumes  that  the  client \ncommunities  will  accept  their  role  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of the infrastructure interventions. \n \nRisks  include  the  watershed  approach  not  resulting  in \nreduced  soil  erosion,  increased  groundwater  recharge, \nincreased  surface  water  for  supplemental  irrigation,  and \nimproved soil fertility. Complementary investments may not \noccur at the micro-watershed level, particularly for rural link \nand  access  roads.  Secretariat  and  agency-based \nadministrators  and  technical  staff  may  not  utilize  the \nproject imparted training to function as effective partners in \nthe development process. Selected interventions will be site-\nspecific;  the  approach  and  interventions  will  be  piloted \nduring  the  first  year  of  the  Project.  Proposed  intensive \nevaluations  and  detailed  assessments  will  result  in  a \nfeedback loop to allow continual learning and adjustments to \nproject implementation.  \n \n \n \n ",

" \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Rural \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis1 \n2.  Poverty in Pakistan is a predominantly rural phenomenon. Approximately 77% of the \npopulation and the vast majority of the nation's poor reside in rural areas. Most derive their living \nfrom agriculture and off-farm employment. Agriculture remains the single largest sector of the \neconomy, and is the most important sector for employment and income generation. The sector \naccounts for about 26% of real gross domestic product and approximately 50% of employment. \nGrowth in the sector has stagnated over the past few years, although it is likely to remain the \nprimary contributor for some time. An uncertain policy environment (especially concerning the \nprices and marketing of major crops) combined with widespread resource degradation has \ncontributed to low productivity and profitability. Other contributors to the sector's performance \ninclude  low  quality  inputs,  poor  quality  of  support  services,  inefficient  water  resource \nmanagement, and inadequate rural infrastructure. \n \n3.  FATA\u2019s pervasive poverty has not been statistically documented. The Pakistan integrated \nhousehold survey has not been implemented in FATA and no statistically valid surveys or \nsamples are available. While this has been a distinct frustration for government planners, the \nsituation is far from unclear. Rural residents receive few social services; drinking water is in short \nsupply throughout the region, a condition reflected in high infant and child mortality; and village \nsanitation is inadequate. Educational facilities are deficient in most villages and nonexistent for \nmost girls. Most children do not attend school at all, and literacy rates are among the lowest in \nthe country. Health facilities are substandard at best and usually not available at all. Factors \nunderlying the region's poverty include (i) historical, political, and social isolation; (ii) a legal \nsystem reliant on executive and judicial authority administered through civil servants preferring to \nmaintain  the  status  quo;  (iii)  poor  quality  and  coverage  of  institutions  responsible  for  the \nprovision of basic services; (iv) social practices that preclude women\u2019s participation in economic \nlife; and (v) lack of effective institutions for skill training to enable the labor force to shift from low- \nto high-productivity sectors. These factors substantially mirror those detailed for the rural areas \nin the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy.2 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  FATA runs in a narrow belt along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It consists of seven \nagencies3  and  six  bordering  frontier  regions,4  and  is  of  immense  geostrategic  and  political \nimportance. Acceding to Pakistan at partition from India with the understanding that they would \nremain autonomous, they are characterized by cultural conservatism and adherence to tribal \nvalues and practices. Although directly administered by the federal Government, the people \nmaintain strong kinship alliances and economic linkages with neighboring Afghanistan. The \n                                                 \n1  ADB. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Preparing the Federally Administered Tribal \nAreas Rural Development Project. Manila (TA 3984-PAK, approved on 13 November 2002, for $750,000). \n2  Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad. \n3  An agency is an administrative unit equivalent to a district. \n4  FATA comprises seven agencies (Bajaur, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, North Waziristan, Orakzai, and South \nWaziristan), and the frontier regions of Bannu, D. I. Khan, Kohat, Lakki, Peshawar, and Tank. \n ", "2   \nproject area consists of the three northern FATA agencies of Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand. \nThese have almost half (46%) of the estimated population of FATA and half of the cultivated \narea (49%), within slightly less than one quarter of the land area. About 70% of the land is not \nsuitable for farming; much of it is dry and rocky. About 20% of Bajaur\u2019s farmed area has some \nirrigation, but 4% or less of the farmed area of Khyber and Mohmand. With the exception of the \nlarger towns and villages of Khyber Agency, which borders Peshawar and has significant trading \nactivity across the Khyber Pass, the population of the project area is rural, distributed in over \n1,200 villages (Appendix 2). \n \n5.  In  the  project  area  the  poorest  families  earn  their  living  from  small  farms  as \nsharecroppers, or through agricultural wage labor. Members of family groups work at many \nactivities,  including  agriculture  and  animal  husbandry,  firewood  collection,  local  wage  or \ncraftwork,  and  small  enterprises  like  tailoring  or  tending  small  shops.  Sharecroppers  are \nobligated to provide most of their own and their family\u2019s labor to agricultural production on the \nland  allocated  to  them,  but  under  certain  conditions  they  undertake  wage  labor.  Women \ncontribute a significant portion of the agricultural labor force through their involvement in a broad \nrange of agricultural activities, but their contribution is not officially recognized. Most individual \nresidents do not participate in decisions regarding development activities and community needs \nare not necessarily reflected in decisions. Few linkages are available to the outside world, and \nvery few organizations or networks are available by which individuals or communities can seek \nand  gain  alternative  ideas,  or  express  their  needs.  The  persistence  of  patriarchal  and \nconservative societal values and related gender-discriminatory practices affect women's access \nto basic social services and productive resources in the project area. Women have virtually no \nchance  to  form  networks  or  support  organizations,  or  become  part  of  community  self-help \ngroups;  and  are  not  included  in  land  and  water  resource  decision-making  processes. \nFurthermore 5\u20137% of households are headed by women, mostly widows; these households are \namong the poorest.  \n \n6.  The Agricultural Census (2000) reports that only about 30% of the land is in \u201cfarm area,\u201d \na broad classification of land under ownership and use, mostly under rain-fed conditions. The \ncategory includes forests, but does not entirely account for rangelands. Individual ownership of \nagricultural land is recognized, while the range and forests are communal. Communal land \n(shamilat) consists of grasses, shrubs, and scattered trees managed by the community for \nanimal grazing, fuelwood collection, timber harvesting, and other nonwood forest products and \nservices. The Pakistan Forest Act 1927 and other forestry rules and regulations do not extend to \nFATA.  \n \n7.  FATA's natural capital has degraded over recent years. On both private agricultural and \ncommunal rangelands, the degradation process is obvious, with low agricultural productivity, loss \nof vegetation, accelerated sheet and gully erosion, and low moisture retention capacity. The lack \nof water creates a dangerous positive feedback cycle as vegetation cover is removed, resulting \nin low water absorption and retention capacity, and inability to support vegetation. In certain \nareas, due to the poor productivity of land, local residents and desperate Afghan refugees have \ncultivated marginal lands, with a resultant further loss of fertility.  \n \n8.  Only  a  limited  development  effort  has  been devoted  to  FATA  over  many  years,  as \nevidenced by a declining rate of growth of real per capita public expenditure since the mid-\n1990s, a situation that appears to have changed, with major increases in the 2003\u20132004 and \n2004\u20132005 budget cycles. Infrastructure, particularly blacktopped roads, has improved in FATA \nover  the  last  2  years,  primarily  as  a  result  of  military  activities  in  the  region.  However,  a \nsignificant part of FATA remains devoid of adequate road access. Drinking water sourced from \nwithin the villages is available to 60\u201370% of households, but the volume and quality are not high. \n ", "3 \nAbout a third of these households have water within their house compounds\u2014either piped or by \nwell. Irrigation water is much sought after and creates an income surplus for those with access; \nbut irrigation systems are not efficient, the practices are wasteful, and the water table continues \nto subside, either as a result of drought or because of existing tubewells overexploiting the \naquifer. The lack of communication networks, schools, and health facilities reflects the local \ndecision-making  process  in  which  the  balance  of  interest  among  kinship  groups,  factional \nrivalries, and political groupings determines investment.  \n \n9.  In Pakistan overall, during the 1990s to the present, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other funding agencies have had varied and extensive involvement in agriculture and rural \ndevelopment. These interventions (Appendix 3) aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity, \npromoting  market-oriented  policy  reforms,  strengthening  the  institutional  framework,  and \ndeveloping resource-scarce areas of the country. Experience with this assistance indicates that, \nin general, project impact is reduced when inadequate focus is placed on consultation with \nbeneficiaries,  ownership,  flexibility  in  project design,  sequencing  and  prioritization,  capacity, \ndysfunctional  systems  of  the  project  implementing  agencies,  and  postproject  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). Some projects experienced considerable delays and revisions in design \nand scope due to (i) limited availability and untimely release of local funds; (ii) late starts and \nprotracted implementation delays due to political disruption and security problems; and (iii) \ndesign deficiencies arising from lack of information or inadequate attention to the legal, political, \ninstitutional,  and  sociocultural  environment.  Lessons  learned  also  indicate  that  to  have  an \nimpact,  rural  development  projects  should  be  implemented  using  a  phased  approach, \nparticipatory impact assessments should be carried out from time to time, and the designed \nmonitoring and evaluation systems should be simple and not beyond the comprehension of \nproject implementation entities. Lastly, ownership of the development activities and their O&M by \nthe communities is essential for sustainability. In light of these lessons, the Project ensures (i) \nfuller  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  project  design  and  implementation  leading  to  greater \nownership,  (ii)  a  process-based  approach,  (iii)  localized  implementation  arrangements  with \ncapacity support to government and community groups for implementation and maintenance, \nand (iv) use of robust technology. \n \n10.  The Project is in line with the Government\u2019s vision and development goals articulated in \nthe Medium Term Development Framework and its Poverty Reduction Strategy. A key objective \nis to accelerate gross domestic product growth, reduce unemployment, and eliminate poverty. \nThe Government's target is to reduce absolute poverty from 30% in 2001 to 15% by 2011. ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy is based on Pakistan\u2019s development goals and priorities for poverty reduction.5 \nIt also incorporates ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction and lessons learned from \npast operational experience in Pakistan. The strategy attaches importance to reviving growth in \nPakistan, with a focus on interventions aimed at promoting growth in sectors or activities that \nhave maximum poverty reduction impact, including rural development. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The Project is to (i) improve the productive potential of participating watersheds and their \nassociated natural resource base; (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities in the project area \nto  participate  in  planning,  implementation,  social  and  environmental  management,  and \nmaintenance  of  assets  emanating  from  local  development  programs;  and  (iii)  support  the \nimplementing departments in the project area to operate in a more socially inclusive manner \n                                                 \n5  The Project first appeared in the 2002\u20132004 Country Strategy and Program.  \n ", "4   \nwithin the framework of a convergent watershed development planning process. This will be \naccomplished  by  having  community  groups  implement  most  of  the  subprojects  using  the \nProject's collaborative approach and capacity-building initiatives. The Project will target poor \ncommunities,  and  establish  an  institutional  base  for  planning  and  implementing  multisector \nactivities  to  improve  their  livelihoods.  The  Project  will  operate  in  18  tehsils  (subdistricts) \nrepresenting approximately 1,200 communities. The project area has a population of slightly less \nthan 1.5 million; at least 900,000 are living below the Government's official poverty line.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n12.  The Project includes three components: (i) integrated resource management to facilitate \nthe  sustainable  increase  in  production  from  renewable  natural  resources;  (ii)  community \ninfrastructure  to  improve  crop  production  and  transportation;  and  (iii)  project  planning, \nmanagement, and support to strengthen agency planning, implementation, and capacity for \nimproved  service  delivery  to  communities.  Communities  in  the  project  area  do  not  have \nexperience with development interventions; thus the Project aims to build a broad alliance \nbetween  communities  and  government  to  address  long-term  needs  for  improving  farm \nproduction  and  incomes,  reversing  environmental  degradation,  and  improving  watershed \nmanagement. Priority will be given to activities with immediate impacts to establish community \nconfidence. \n \n1.  Component 1: Integrated Resource Management \n13.  The Project will provide assistance for identifying and selecting appropriate agricultural \ntechnologies,  and  train  farmers  and  extension  agents  in  new  agricultural  techniques \n(Supplementary Appendix A). The main target group comprises small landholders and farmers, \nsome with and some without irrigation water. Formation of a community organization, or water \nuser  association,  is  a  prerequisite  to  their  participation.  The  short-term  impact  of  initial \nrecommendations  will  be  significant,  since  with  project  support,  farmers  can  achieve  yield \nincreases in a single season with small introductions of relatively inexpensive high-yielding \nvarieties, improved seed usage, judicial use of fertilizer, and adoption of better crop management \npractices.6   \n \n14.  Farming systems in the project area are rain-fed (barani), subsistence production, or \nirrigated production that produces a marketable surplus. The rain-fed system is low input, low \noutput, high risk, and dependant on infrequent and unreliable rainfall. Irrigated farming is more \nstable and productive of food grains, providing potential cash alternatives such as vegetable \nraising or fruit production. Livestock production is integral to both systems, with crop residue \nproviding a major source of animal feed, especially for milk production, which is important for \nhousehold consumption or sale. Where irrigation is available, the potential for filling a seasonal \nniche in vegetable production is good. Fodder crops are important for livestock production, while \ncrop residues form a large part of livestock feed, converting agricultural leavings into milk, meat, \nand marketable savings. Adequate fodder is a concern of all farmers, especially those with no \nirrigation.  \n                                                 \n6  The Project will build on positive experiences, including those of the development programs implemented by the \nNarcotics Affairs Section of the Government of the United States. These have demonstrated farmer acceptance of \nhigh-yielding varieties. \n ", "5 \na.  Farming Systems and Crop Production \n15.  The subcomponent includes (i) improved seed technology and farming demonstrations, \n(ii) training of trainers and farmer field training in integrated crop management, (iii) adaptive \nresearch trials, and (iv) varietal screening of specific seeds. The existing and tested model of \nintegrated crop management through farmer field schools will be followed. Working through \ncommunity organizations, on-farm adaptive trials on farmer\u2019s fields for key crops will improve \nproductivity.  Seed  block  demonstrations  for  wheat  and  maize  varieties  through  \u201cterms  of \npartnership\u201d between farmer groups and the relevant agency will serve as testing areas and \ndemonstration schools for farmers. Adaptive research trials are the basis for farmers to verify \nand accept appropriate technologies. Good varieties for local testing are available in North-West \nFrontier  Province  (NWFP)  for  wheat,  barley,  maize,  sugarcane,  rice,  and  okra  (bhindi). \nScreening onion and tomato varieties on farmers\u2019 fields will create a valuable synergy between \nresearch  and  practice,  where  the  optimal  varieties  for  local  conditions  are  unknown.  Line \ndepartment capabilities in these extension techniques will be strengthened through training and \nexperience. \n \nb.  Livestock and Fodder Development \n16.  Livestock production is an integral part of the farming system for most households in the \nproject area, whether owners, tenants, or the landless. Livestock are closely integrated with the \nexisting  farming  systems  since  livestock  depend  on  crop  residues.  Women  contribute \nsignificantly to livestock management, but their skills and knowledge are traditional and limited. \nVillage knowledge of animal nutrition and health practices is minimal, with virtually no links to \nformal sources of information about disease, medicines, or developments in veterinary services. \nMost of these health problems are preventable, and could be treated at the village through timely \nvaccination and deworming. The Department of Livestock and Dairy Development faces severe \nconstraints in providing appropriate animal health services.7 Subsidized vaccination, artificial \ninsemination, and feed analysis are the only public support to producers and even these are \nlimited by inadequate budgets. Few local staff are actually working in the more distant areas, \nthus local residents need to be trained as village veterinary health workers.8  \n \n17.  Accordingly,  the  subcomponent  will  focus  on  providing  community  training  and \nknowledge transfer on animal nutrition and animal husbandry practices through (i) analysis, \nplanning,  and  capacity  building  for  line  department  staff;  (ii)  improved  fodder  and  forage \nproduction; and (iii) training of village animal husbandry workers, including women. Increasing \nper animal productivity through better nutrition lowers the need for more animals in herds or \nhouseholds,  reduces  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  provides  scope  for  reversing  the \nrangeland degradation process. Nutrition activities will increase available fodder and improve \nforage production. Straw enrichment and fodder preservation techniques such as hay and silage \nmaking will enhance year-round availability of feed. Fodder as a cash crop will be encouraged. \nHigh-quality forage at strategic points, and using off-season feed from otherwise unused lands \nwill reduce the burden on overgrazed ranges.  \n                                                 \n7  Constraints include (i) a restricted operating budget, (ii) limited access to project areas due to lack of transport, (iii) \nlack  of  vaccines  and  medicines,  (iv)  difficulty  in  obtaining  timely  laboratory  backup,  (v)  lack  of  quantitative \nknowledge of the patterns of occurrence of diseases and their economic importance, (vi) lack of appropriate animal \nhealth delivery models specifically tailored to existing farming and grazing systems, and (vii) lack of a broad-based \nextension program for dairy production. \n8  The combined number of officers and veterinary assistants to the livestock head count are about 1 to 6,100 in \nMohmand, 1 to 7,300 in Bajaur, and 1 to 15,600 in Khyber. These numbers overwhelm any realistic effort to provide \ndirect veterinary assistance through the government agency. \n ", "6   \nc.  Community Forestry and Range Management \n18.  The subcomponent aims to (i) integrate farm forestry activities within the existing farming \nsystem; (ii) rehabilitate and develop denuded community lands through improved vegetative \ncover; (iii) introduce the participatory and multiple use concept of forest management in existing \nscrub forests to diversify both wood and nonwood forest products and services; and (iv) build the \ntechnical, social, institutional, and entrepreneurial capacity of small farmers of the project area, \nincluding women, in plant nursery operations, tree planting, forest management, and controlled \ngrazing. \n \n19.  Farm forestry activities include seedling production, tree planting, management, and tree \nwood utilization concentrated on fast-growing, drought-resistant trees. Private (home-based) \nnurseries will provide the community with preferred forest species for planting on farmland, and \nwill  be  supported  by  technical  and  market  information.  Field  nurseries  will  provide  income \nopportunities for women and families who manage them. Trees will be mainly forest varieties, but \ngrowers will be free to raise fruit and ornamental plants, as well as fodder trees for livestock, \ndepending on the need. About 900 home-based and 200 field nurseries will produce sufficient \nseedlings for farm and community forestry, and provide income for 3,000 direct and indirect \nbeneficiaries. Benefits to the water table and reforestation will have local and regional impact. \nNew  plantations  will  be  established  on  community  land  under  terms  of  partnership  with \ncommunity organizations that define planning, implementation, and monitoring responsibilities. \nCommunities will define and agree on the distribution of benefits. The Department of Forestry will \nraise plantations on a pilot basis; community groups can then choose to adopt them on a larger \nscale. Plantations will fulfill subsistence needs, and will generate additional income, while the \ntrees  will  increasingly  provide  local  employment  in  wood-related  businesses.  The  Forestry \nDepartment will provide communities with technical support in cleaning, pruning, thinning, and \ninformation on when to harvest and where to find markets. This relationship forms the basis for \nparticipatory management plans for existing natural forests and established plantations. \n \n20.  Inadequate  community  management  of  the  common  lands  leads  to  meager  forage \navailability, diminished animal health, and reduced livestock productivity. Deferred and rotational \ngrazing systems offer simple management methods. Controlled grazing on 200 to 300 hectare \n(ha) plots managed as part of a village development plan encourages natural regeneration of \nnatural grasses and forbs. In appropriate areas, controlled grazing will include water harvesting \nthrough contour trenches, contour ditches, check dams,9 and stock-water ponds. A training \nneeds assessment of community and institutional requirements for carrying out these activities \nwill be conducted early in project implementation utilizing capabilities present within NWFP. \n2.  Component 2: Community Infrastructure \n21.  Infrastructure investments will remove critical infrastructure obstacles to service delivery \nand productivity through new construction and improvement of drinking water supply, small-scale \nirrigation and water storage structures, and link and access roads. Appendix 4 lists infrastructure \nselection  criteria,  and  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  component  is  available  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n                                                 \n9  A check dam is a small dam constructed across a drainage channel to lower the speed of concentrated flows and \nthereby facilitate infiltration to groundwater. \n ", "7 \na.  Water Resource Assessment and Management Plan \n22.  Water resources and their development and sustainable management are integral to \nimproving the well-being of FATA residents. Due to their importance and the substantial role \nplayed by water-related interventions, this subcomponent will include a ground- and surface-\nwater assessment and development of a management plan as part of the first year activities. The \nwater  assessment  and  management  plan  will  evaluate  the  current  status  of  surface-  and \ngroundwater  in  the  three  project  agencies  to  determine  safe  yields  for  groundwater  and \nexploitable  surface  runoff  to  identify  areas  for  wells  and  small  water  developments.  The \nassessment will identify suitable sites for larger interventions such as ponds and small storages, \nflood control works, and gravity (diversion or small storage) irrigation systems. It will provide \ntechnical expertise and work with relevant line agencies to develop a surface- and groundwater \nmonitoring system along with a development and management framework and plan.  \nb.  Drinking Water Supply Schemes \n23.  Provision of drinking water supplies is a priority intervention throughout the project area. \nMost villages located in the foothills will benefit from spring-fed gravity schemes; plains areas will \nlargely rely on pumped schemes based on dug wells, hand pumps, and a limited number of \ntubewells where groundwater extraction is sustainable. Field surveys in all areas show that \nwomen and older female children typically spend several hours every day carrying water from \nfar-off springs or streams, which are usually open to contamination. The Project will construct \naround 212 spring-fed, gravity-flow systems, each providing an average of 60 liters per capita. \nThis effort will ensure a supply of clean drinking water through a system of community tanks or \nstand posts and help alleviate the severe problems faced by the relatively remote settlements. \nAll schemes will be identified through a participatory process with villagers required to provide \nunskilled labor, implementation management, and O&M after completion. The actual size and \nnumber of various community-managed schemes will be determined in consultation with village \norganizations.  \n \n24.  Around 624 dug-well schemes are proposed, particularly in areas where the groundwater \ntable is high and stable. These typically are multipurpose drinking water and irrigation water \nsources. An average dug well provides for the drinking water needs of 10 to 20 households. \nUsers/farmers are expected to provide up to 50% of the cost of such schemes through in-kind \ncontributions. Tubewell-based schemes for drinking water (as well as irrigation) are feasible \nwhere  the  potential  for  springs  or  shallow  groundwater  development  is  generally  low.  The \nsituation is particularly severe in parts of Khyber and Mohmand agencies. Because of their \ncomplexity, private contractors will carry out tubewell boring, testing, and development, as well \nas the construction of overhead  reservoirs. The village organization will be responsible for \ninstallation  of  the  distribution  systems  as  well  as  O&M  after  completion.  Communities\u2019 \ncommitment to meet the energy cost of operating schemes will be a condition for eligibility. In \nareas without access to electricity, diesel generators will be supplied. About 31 tubewell-based \nwater supply systems will be provided where groundwater is sustainable for their supply.  \n \n25.  Hand  pumps  typically serve  the  needs  of  a section  of a  village,  as  discharges  are \ngenerally small. Depending on the village size and hand-pump capacity, more than one scheme \nmay  be  required.  The  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  Department  will  provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) during implementation as well as O&M training to selected villagers. \nStandards already established under the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)-funded rural \nwater supply and sanitation projects in NWFP will be followed. The relatively simple construction \nwill allow significant involvement of the local communities who will provide labor and local \n ", "8   \nmaterials,  and  ensure  maintenance  and  repair  after  completion.  Around  135  hand-pump \nschemes are envisioned under the Project.  \n26.  The  Project  includes  financing  of  a  proposed  Shalman  to  Landi  Kotal  water  supply \nscheme, which will serve the population of Landi Kotal town and other communities along the \nroute of the pipeline in Khyber agency, including Afghan refugees. The scheme is expected to \nserve approximately 78,000 people by 2030. A summary description of the scheme is available \nin Appendix 5 and the details in Supplementary Appendix C. Financing will be contingent on \nsuccessful  compliance  with  the  conditions  set  forth  in  Appendix  5  and  the  relevant  loan \nassurances. \n \nc.  Small Irrigation Systems \n27.  Irrigation schemes in the project area operate at low efficiencies or are in disrepair. \nSurface and flood irrigation schemes have suffered badly due to excessive silting or damage. \nDiversion works with protection bunds along the banks of the local watercourses have collapsed \nor  been  washed  away  by  floods.  Repairing  systems  that  are  damaged  or  have  incurred \nexcessive wear and tear is largely beyond the capacity of local farmers. Existing schemes \nurgently need rehabilitation. The Project will improve about 72 existing and construct about 36 \nnew irrigation structures, through cost-sharing arrangements with local communities, combined \nwith farmers\u2019 training in construction techniques as well as O&M. Commitment to meeting O&M \nwill be a condition for eligibility of subproject selection. Rainwater harvesting through check dams \nwill be an important focus as the bulk of the surface rainfall runoff is untapped due to limited \nknowledge or low capacity of local villagers. Approximately 130 check dams are proposed. \nWhere feasible, the Project plans to construct about 80 small ponds and about 12 delayed action \ndams of a maximum height of 6 meters (m) to create storage for irrigation, improve groundwater \nrecharge, as well as ensure water supplies for livestock and other nondrinking needs of the local \ncommunities.  \n \n28.  In some areas on gravity irrigation schemes, water losses due to seepage, subsurface \npercolation, and evaporation are high. Conveyance efficiencies are also low because of poor \nchannel alignment and inadequate slopes of field-level structures. Where appropriate the lining \nof  the  channels  and  other  associated  hydraulic  structures  will  be  supported  to  improve \nconveyance efficiencies. Several streams have perennial flow that will be harnessed through \nprovision of pumping systems or new and improved diversion structures, subject to technical and \nfinancial feasibility. Flood diversion schemes will increase farmers\u2019 ability to protect against \nexcessive runoff, improve water management, and irrigate a larger command area through \nefficient on-farm water management by the respective communities. The Project will focus on \nsoil conservation by constructing protection bunds along the affected land and reclaiming eroded \nland.  Accordingly,  the  Project  will  finance  the  construction  of  schemes  with  sufficient \ngroundwater potential, and a large number of resident beneficiaries. \n \nd.  Road Construction and Improvement \n29.  A very limited program of works on arterial roads will address problems of accessibility \nbetween adjacent valleys and villages, which affect significant population clusters. Of the total \nroad  network,  nearly  40%  are  shingled  tracks  while  the  rest  are  all-weather  blacktop.  The \ncondition  of  the  smaller  rural  roads  linking  villages  to  arterial  roads  is  generally  poor  and \nresources  for  their  maintenance  and  repair  inadequate.  The  subcomponent  will  benefit  the \nrelatively remote clusters of villages that are currently inaccessible, through the construction of \nlow-cost link roads. This requires community participation in identification of alignment, provision \nof land, community supervision during construction, and assured maintenance and repair after \n ", "9 \ncompletion. Training will be provided to villagers and village organizations on maintenance, \nrepair, and management of roads. The second category of road work will include improving and \nupgrading existing roads that have fallen into disrepair or are in need of priority works. A total of \n120 kilometers (km) of new low-cost link roads and 72 km of improvement/upgrading works are \nproposed. All roads identified for project support will be selected in accordance with agreed \nselection criteria (Appendix 4).    \n \n3.  Component 3: Project Planning, Management, and Support \n30.  Project planning, management, and other support services will be provided to facilitate \ntimely implementation, including (i) engaging consultants and other specialist contract services; \n(ii) procuring vehicles and equipment; and (iii) establishing accounting, monitoring, and reporting \nsystems. A key feature will be the establishment of a management information system (MIS) for \nregular monitoring of physical and financial progress and development impacts of the project. \nThe MIS will link the project management unit (PMU) and project implementation units (PIUs) \nwith the project executing and implementing agencies.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Advisory Technical Assistance \n31.  Separate capacity-building advisory TA10 is currently being provided to line departments11 \nworking in FATA responsible for project implementation. This includes agency-based staff and \ntheir  provincial  head  offices.  Key  focus  areas  of  the  TA  include  (i)  strengthening  project \nmanagement,  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  (ii)  strengthening  financial  management \nsystems and procedures covering planning, budgeting, cash-flow management, and systems \nand procedures to monitor financial and implementation performance; (iii) enhancing information, \ncommunication,  and  technology  systems;  and  (iv)  familiarizing  the  target  group  with  ADB \npolicies,  procedures,  and  guidelines.  The  TA  will  also  undertake  community-based \norganizational strengthening and prepare detailed implementation manuals. Training programs \ncovering  these  focus  areas  will  be  completed  before  substantive  activities  of  the  Project \ncommence. \n \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n32.  The Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (as amended) is the core legislation used in Pakistan \nfor acquiring private lands for a public purpose. But this act, as with most other laws of Pakistan, \ndoes not apply to FATA. Local needs for land acquisition are addressed through the system of \nland rights and distribution. In the absence of a formal legal policy for land acquisition and \nresettlement,  a  project-specific  set  of  resettlement  principles  consistent  with  ADB  policy \nrequirements has been adopted for the Project. The level of land acquisition required is expected \nto  vary  from  significant  to  nonsignificant  depending  on  individual  project  interventions.  A \nsummary of land acquisition and resettlement is provided in Appendix 6 and the resettlement \nframework is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003.

Project Investment Plan \n33.  The estimated project cost is $60.4 million equivalent, inclusive of land acquisition and \nresettlement compensation, physical and price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and \nservice charges during construction. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $11.4 million, or \nabout 19% of the total cost. The local currency cost is estimated at $49 million equivalent, or \nabout 81% of the total cost. The local currency costs include an estimated $1.8 million equivalent \nfor taxes and duties to be paid by the Government. The project cost estimate summarized in \nTable 1 and Appendix 7 should be regarded as indicative only.

Financing Plan \n34.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $42.0  million  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The loan will \nfinance 70% of the total project cost: $11.4 million of the foreign exchange cost (100%) and \n$30.6 million equivalent of the local currency cost (70%). The Government will provide $15.4 \nmillion  equivalent,  or  25%  of  the  project  cost,  including  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncompensation of $2.7 million. The beneficiaries will contribute $3.0 million equivalent, or 5% of \nthe project cost through their labor inputs.12 The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12 The Project will pay unskilled laborers 60% of the cash value of labor inputs. \n ", "11 \nTable 2: Financing Plan a \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency Cost \nAsian Development Bank  11.4  30.6  42.0  70 \nGovernmentb  0  15.4  15.4  25 \nBeneficiaries  0  3.0  3.0  5 \n  Total  11.4  49.0  60.4  100 \na The allocation of loan proceeds in the loan agreement are presented in the special drawing rights \n(SDR) equivalent of US dollars, with reference only to total expenditure in accordance with the \nADB Board paper: ADB. 2005.

Project Management \na.  Executing and Implementing Agencies \n35.  The  Ministry  of  States  and  Frontier  Regions,  as  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  is \nresponsible for (i) overall coordination and management of the Project, including coordination \nwith other Government ministries and agencies, and other stakeholders at the national level; (ii) \nensuring  timely  budgetary  allocations  to  the  PMU;  and  (iii)  ensuring  necessary  national \napprovals are obtained in a timely manner for effective project implementation. The Secretary \nwill appoint a staff person to manage the EA\u2019s role in the Project. The Governor\u2019s Secretariat \n(FATA), the Implementing Agency (IA), is responsible for day-to-day coordination of project \nactivities among the line departments and for supervision of the overall project. \n \n    b.  Management and Implementation Units \n \n36.  The  Project  will  follow  a  decentralized  implementation  arrangement  to  facilitate \nparticipation  of  communities.  Project  management  will  be  at  two  levels:  (i)  at  Peshawar \ninterfacing with the Governor's Secretariat (FATA), other government agencies, private and civil \nsociety  through  a  PMU;  and  (ii)  at  the  agency  level  through  PIUs  in  Bajaur,  Khyber,  and \nMohmand. Planning and operational project management will be at the agency level, where \nactivities will be identified, endorsed, and implemented through government line departments, \noutsourced consultants, and contracted experts. The Peshawar-based PMU headed by a project \ndirector, will (i) coordinate project-related issues with the EA, IA, agencies, and private and civil \nsociety; (ii) consolidate work plans prepared by the PIUs and facilitate approval by the project \nsteering committee (PSC); (iii) award contracts exceeding the amount equivalent to $100,000; \n(iv) recruit consultants; (v) perform monitoring and evaluation; (vi) supervise consultants and \ncontractors; and (vii) manage project finances.  \n \n37.  A PIU will be established in each of the three agencies, headed by a project manager. \nEach PIU will (i) coordinate project operational issues with the line departments in the respective \nagency; (ii) prepare work plans under the project, obtain endorsement of work plans by the  \nagency project board (APB) and implement the same; (iii) award contracts up to the equivalent of \n$100,000; (iv) assist the PMU in supervision of consultants and contractors; (v) assist the PMU \nin monitoring and evaluation project activities; and (vi) manage finances related to the project in \nthe respective agency. The project managers will report to the project director. \n \n ", "12   \n38.  All project staff, including the project director and three project managers, will be hired on \na  contract  basis  through  an  open  and  competitive  process.  The  qualifications,  experience, \nexpertise and terms of reference of the project director will be subject to ADB approval. The \nPMU in Peshawar will use either existing government facilities or rent offices during project \nimplementation. The Project will construct offices for each PIU.13 In addition, women\u2019s hostels \nwill be constructed in Bajaur and Mohmand agencies. For security reasons, both office and \nhostel facilities will be constructed inside the political agent compounds on land provided by the \npolitical agency. Until completion of construction, the agencies will provide temporary working \nand sleeping accommodation for both staff and consultants. \n \n    c.   Steering Committee \n39.  A  PSC  will  be  established  to  (i)  provide  policy  guidance  and  interpretations  in \nimplementation of the project; (ii) approve the consolidated annual work plans for the three \nagencies; (iii) review on semiannual basis, the progress of the project including performance of \nthe project director and other PMU staff; (iv) coordinate and direct activities of line departments \nunder the project; and (v) recommend issues for consideration of the project review board (PRB). \nThe  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary,  Governor\u2019s  Secretariat  (FATA)  and  include  as \nmembers (i) a representative of the EA; (ii) representatives of the line departments; (iii) the \npolitical agents;14 and (iv) the project director will serve as the member/secretary. The PSC shall \nmeet as required but not less than four times a year. \n \n    d.  Review Board \n40.  A PRB will be established to resolve issues of strategic importance which may affect \nsmooth  implementation  of  the  project,  take  related  policy  decisions  and  review  the  project \nprogress annually. The PRB will be chaired by the Governor, NWFP with the secretary of the EA \nas its deputy chair.  Other members of the PRB will include: (i) the chief secretary, NWFP; (ii) the \nadditional chief secretary, NWFP; (iii) the secretary, Governor\u2019s Secretariat (FATA) who shall \nalso serve as the secretary to the PRB; (iv) a representative of the Economic Affairs Division; \nand (v) the project director. The PRB shall meet as required but not less than twice a year. \n    e.  Agency Project Boards \n41.  An APB in each agency will established to review and endorse annual work plans within \nthe  agency.  These  plans  will  be  consistent  with  explicit  project  selection  criteria.  Plan \ndevelopment and presentation is the responsibility of the project manager. The APB will be \nchaired by the political agent of the respective agency, with the project manager serving as the \nmember/secretary. Other members will include (i) representatives of the line departments at the \nagency level; (ii) two tribal elders; and (iii) two agency councilors. The APB will meet as required. \nThis arrangement is consistent with a fully decentralized local government structure, anticipated \nfor the future, at which time an elected official will supersede the political agent.   \n \n2.  Component Implementation  \n42.  No large-scale, community-based development activity is currently being undertaken in \nthe project area. The extent to which communities and their leadership, as well as the political \nadministration, will adapt to the Project is unknown. A strong demonstration effect through early, \n                                                 \n13  In Mohmand Agency, the PIU is expected to be housed in an existing building, which will be improved by adding an \nadditional story. In addition, water will be provided on a daily basis by tanker as no other method of regular water \ndelivery is available.  \n14 Political agent refers to the head of an agency. \n ", "13 \npositive action is vital for gaining the confidence of the communities, as well as the positive \ncooperation of the line department staff. PIU social organizing staff will seek out areas most \namenable to cooperation with the Project by using group consultations, discussions with local \nleaders, and participatory rural appraisal techniques to identify priority needs such as drinking \nwater supply schemes; small link roads; rehabilitation and improvement of small-scale irrigation \nsystems; and agricultural, livestock, and forestry programs appropriate to the season. These \ninterventions will be identified with the assistance of line departments and technical contract staff \ntrained in group-based extension techniques. Within the first 6 months of implementation, each \nPIU  will  provide  initial  work  plans,  specifying  watershed  areas  and  proposed  priority  initial \nsubprojects. \n \n43.  Although the process of planning and implementation will require regular consultation \nwith communities over time, some watershed areas have a high probability of accepting and \nworking with the Project. Appendix 8 lists proposed watershed selection criteria. Two such \nwatersheds from each agency will be identified by consensus among the political agent, line \ndepartments, and agency project manager as pilot areas for the first year of implementation, with \nearly attention given to easily identifiable infrastructure and agricultural interventions. Based on \nthe experience of working within six watershed areas in the first year, comprising approximately \n60 villages or community groups, an additional 12 watersheds and 120 villages/communities per \nyear will be selected for planning and implementing various activities during the second and third \nyears respectively. Community members and project staff will track requests for assistance and \nensure  effective  distribution  of  related  activities  within  watersheds  through  the  use  of  a \ngeographic information system-based georeferenced database. Appendix 9 describes subproject \ndevelopment and approval procedures. Detailed implementation arrangements are available in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n44.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years (2006 to 11). The implementation schedule \nis in Appendix 10. First year activities include (i) establishing the project accounts and reporting \nlinks; (ii) contracting and implementing a baseline socioeconomic survey to establish indicators \nfor assessing the Project\u2019s impact on poverty in participating communities; (iii) contracting and \nimplementing  a  water  resource  assessment  study;  (iv)  contracting  and  commencing  an \nindependent performance monitoring and evaluation program; (v) establishing three PIUs, and \ndeveloping annual work plans and staffing schedules for each agency for the first year of project \nimplementation; (vi) identifying two watersheds in each agency for  integrated planning and \ncommencement of priority project activities in some 60 poor communities in those watersheds; \n(vii) establishing a geographic information system database system;15 (viii) recruiting consultants \nand project staff; (ix) establishing a project monitoring and evaluation system; and (x) procuring \nrequisite equipment and vehicles.  \n \n4.  Procurement \n45.  Procurement of vehicles, machinery, office equipment, and special equipment will be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  under  the \nproposed  Shalman  water  supply  scheme  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Because of the small to medium size of the remaining civil \nworks  and  their  scattered  nature,  they  will  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  or  other  arrangements  with  private  contractors  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  local \ncontractors will be required to attend a training course covering ADB standards, procedures, and \n                                                 \n15  Digitized data are available at the Department of Forestry. \n ", "14   \nenvironmental requirements; the training will be updated annually. A list of procurement activities \nis provided in Appendix 11. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n46.  The Project will require a total of 147 person-months of consulting services comprising 21 \nperson-months of international and 126 person-months of domestic specialized services in long- \nand short-term appointments through a consulting firm and individual consultants. In addition, \nspecialized service contracts will be awarded for several project activities including (i) a baseline \nsurvey; (ii) community mobilization activities and a public information campaign; (iii) periodic \nindependent audits of project performance; (iv) the surface- and groundwater assessment study; \nand (v) establishment and implementation of the project management information system. The \nGovernment will engage consulting services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The \nquality-and  cost-based  selection  procedures  will  be  used  in  recruiting  the  consultants.  A \nsummary of consulting services is provided in Appendix 12 and detailed terms of reference in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand Executing Agency. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  To expedite disbursement and ensure timely execution of the Project, immediately after \nloan effectiveness an imprest account for the EA and four second-generation imprest accounts \nfor  the  PMU  and  each  PIU  will  be  opened  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan.  Fund  flow \narrangements are further described in Supplementary Appendix F. The opening of the imprest \naccounts will be subject to the appointment of qualified accounting staff and the establishment of \naccounting systems and internal controls acceptable to ADB by the PMU and the three PIUs. \nThe imprest account will have a ceiling equivalent to an estimated 6-month expenditure or 10% \nof the loan amount, whichever is less. The second-generation imprest account of the PMU will \nhave a ceiling of $150,000 and those of the PIUs will have a ceiling of $100,000. All accounts will \nbe managed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001), and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditure and liquidate advances to the imprest \naccount. The limit for each individual payment on a statement of expenditure will not exceed \n$50,000. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  After consultation with line departments and formal endorsement by the APBs, the PIUs \nwill forward annual work plans to the PMU for onward submission and approval by the PSC. \nWork plans will detail activities scheduled for the forthcoming year, including timing, material and \n ", "15 \nfinancial  inputs  needed,  and  outputs  expected.  The  PIUs  will  provide  the  PMU  with  brief \nquarterly progress reports detailing the physical and financial progress of activities against work-\nplan  targets.  The  PIUs  will  also  adopt  a  transparent  process,  acceptable  to  ADB,  for \ndisseminating  information  on  subproject  expenditure.  The  project  director  will  provide  the \nGovernment and ADB with consolidated quarterly progress reports and comprehensive year-end \nannual reports which will contain information that will feed into the project MIS and by extension, \nthe project performance management system (PPMS). The project director will also provide on a \nsemi-annual basis, a summary of findings of the independent performance reviews and actions \nproposed  in  response  to  these  findings.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  a  project \ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB.  \n \n50.  The PMU and PIUs will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for funds \nprovided to the Project in accordance with international accounting standards. An independent \nexternal auditor acceptable to ADB will audit the accounts annually. The imprest accounts and \nstatement of expenditure procedure will be audited as part of the regular audit of the Project\u2019s \naccount and financial statements. The audited project accounts will be forwarded to ADB not \nlater than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  To ensure that project activities and facilities are managed efficiently and that target \ngroups receive the intended benefits, a participatory PPMS, modeled on the project MIS and \nconsistent with ADB's monitoring system, will be used by the PMU and PIUs. An initial survey to \nestablish the overall monitoring system will be conducted during the initial 6 months of the \nProject. The emphasis will be on impact monitoring and the key indicators will be (i) incorporated \ninto the Project\u2019s regular monitoring process; (ii) reassessed at each comprehensive review and \nat project completion; (iii) used to compare with district indicators and programs in neighboring \nNWFP; and (iv) used to measure the Project\u2019s contribution to achievement of the Medium Term \nDevelopment Framework targets, the Millennium Development Goals, and other relevant targets. \n \n10.  Project Review \n52.  ADB will carry out semiannual reviews of the project. Initial reviews will (i) determine \nwhether  all  the  proposed  implementation  arrangements  and  schedules  are  appropriate,  (ii) \nassess  the  level  of  cooperation  from  agency  political  administrations  in  meeting  project \nobjectives, (iii) review progress on infrastructure activities, (iv) review the integrated resource \ndevelopment activities in terms of their distribution and adoption by beneficiaries, and (v) assess \nprogress of participation by women. A midterm review will be jointly undertaken by ADB and the \nGovernment at the end of 30 months to assess physical and financial progress of the Project, \nimplementation  procedures,  procurement  performance,  monitoring  activities,  PMU/PIU \neffectiveness, and performance of consultants.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n53.  The Project will result in several quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects. Quantifiable \nbenefits include increased crop, livestock, and forest production, as well as time savings in \nhousehold water  supply  provision,  and  time  and  cartage  cost  savings  from  road  transport. \nNonquantified  benefits  include  improved  environmental  conditions;  better  nutrition  and  food \nsecurity; and improved access to medical, educational, and other services outside of the rural \ncommunities targeted by the Project.  \n ", "16   \n \nB.  Financial and Economic Analyses \n54.  Financial and economic analyses were carried out for the Project as a whole and for six \nsubcomponents. The financial analysis was based on farm budgets to assess the impact of the \nProject on farm productivity and returns to the farmers. Six model budgets were prepared. The \noverall estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is about 19.1%. Among \nthe natural resource management subcomponents, the estimated EIRR for the farming systems \nand crop production subcomponent is 37.3% followed by 17.8% for the livestock and fodder \nproduction component. The EIRR for community forestry and range management is estimated as \n17.5%. Among the community infrastructure interventions, the estimated EIRR for community \ndrinking water supply schemes is 31.0%, rural link roads 16.5%, and irrigation works 14.6%. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out for all of the subprojects to examine a range of risks including \nadverse  changes  in  investment  cost,  output  prices,  yields,  implementation  completion,  and \nproject life. Overall, the results are fairly robust. The methodology and details of the financial and \neconomic analyses are provided in Appendix 13 and Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n55.  For most of the irrigation schemes and drinking water supply schemes the responsibility \nfor O&M will lie with the beneficiary households. For the drinking water schemes, O&M costs can \nbe expected to be about 10% of the value of the annual household benefit. For irrigation \nschemes, average O&M costs will be about 12.5% of the financial benefits. In both cases, \nbeneficiary communities should have sufficient incentives to ensure their schemes continue to \nfunction well. \n \nC.  Household and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n56.  Project  benefits  will  accrue  initially  to  those  willing  to  participate  in  community \norganizations.  Benefits  from  training  programs  or  infrastructure  and  improved  farming  and \nlivestock rearing practices, and additional income through rehabilitation of the ecosystem will \naccrue generally to community members. Access to organizations and participation within them \nby all interested individuals will be a unifying theme for community mobilization. Organizations \nwill  be  established  based  on  socially  acceptable  norms,  with  men  and  women\u2019s  groups \n(Appendix 14) separately addressing issues of mutual interest in a culturally appropriate manner. \nAs a result of the Project, beneficiaries will obtain access to opportunities for improving their \nlivelihoods, broaden networks of knowledge and contacts with service providers, and learn more \nproductive farming techniques with all the community sharing access to improved infrastructure. \nThe Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is in Appendix 15.  \n \n57.  The farming system and crop management subcomponent will increase production for \nabout 37,500 beneficiary households, or 337,500 people (assuming an average holding of 1.4 ha \nper household and an average household size of 9). After a full phasing in of benefits, annual \nincremental farm income should rise by about PRs6,000 per household. Most benefits will go to \nlandholders\u2015an estimated 57% of whom are poor. Incremental labor days for crop production \nare estimated at 585,000 annually and at least a portion of this will go to hired labor. The \nlivestock and fodder management subcomponent will affect 414,000 people in the targeted \nhouseholds. Through increased milk and live weight, annual incremental household income can \nbe expected to be PRs1,600. The poor will have access to these benefits, though they will \nprobably concentrate on smaller animals. \n \n58.  Irrigation development should benefit 4,750 households (42,750 people). Per household \nincremental income will be about PRs54,900 per household. The poor\u2019s share will be similar to \nthat noted in the farming system subcomponent. Increased incremental labor days are expected \n ", "17 \nto be 919,500 days per year\u2014some of which will increase employment for hired labor. Drinking \nwater supply schemes should affect about 160,000 people. The time saving and decreased \nmedical cost benefits are valued at about PRs8,400 per household per year. The road and \nforestry subcomponents will benefit the communities at large, including the poor. The forestry \nprogram will increase employment by an average of 123,500 person-days per year. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n59.  The natural environment of the project area has undergone severe degradation due to \nintensified  use  of  the  range,  forest  products,  and  water  resources.  Existing  institutional \narrangements  are  incapable  of  reversing  this  process  of  degradation.  The  Project  aims  to \nintroduce  an  integrated  watershed  management  approach  combining  agriculture,  irrigation, \nrange, and forestry interventions within defined watershed areas. This approach will help reduce \npressure on the currently degraded resource base, increase water availability in watershed \nareas, and control the erosion damage resulting from runoff. Awareness of the environmental \nbenefits from integrated planning and management of watersheds will be disseminated through \ncommunity  organizations,  training  for  community  leaders,  and  capacity  building  for  line \ndepartment  staff.  Current  infrastructure  construction  practices,  especially  for  roads,  do  not \nconsider the environmental damages caused by such construction. However the Project will \nintroduce planning, design, and construction practices with suitable environmental mitigation \nmeasures  based  on  appropriate  environmental  assessment  studies  (as  described  in  the \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures framework in Supplementary Appendix I). \nThe  awareness,  and  knowledge  and  technology  transfer  from  undertaking  environmentally \nsound infrastructure construction will set a valuable precedent among communities and line \ndepartments to guide future practice. Overall, the Project is expected to have a positive impact \non the environment. The summary initial environmental examination report is in Supplementary \nAppendix J, and initial environmental examination in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nE.  Project Assumptions and Risks \n60.  A defining feature of FATA is the continuing importance of tribal elders and leaders, the \nmaliks. Operating without their agreement, support, and protection is difficult, if not impossible. \nPolitical agents play a key role in providing introductions to local leaders, and thereby ensuring \naccess, particularly to formerly inaccessible areas. The maliks either own or control a large part \nof the economic resources and government investments in their areas. In such circumstances, \nsignificant portions of the local population are excluded from decision-making or sharing in the \nbenefits  of  development.  Excluding  the  better-off  members  of  communities  from  receiving \nbenefits is neither possible, nor desirable, but opportunities must be distributed more equitably. \nWithin the existing \u201cmaliki\u201d system, the poorer residents of communities and especially women \ndo not normally get a chance to improve their material well-being.  \n \n61.  Achieving  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  project  benefits  requires  that  agency  line \ndepartments diligently adhere to a process of regular consultation with beneficiaries, with the \nconsent and support of the political agents and the local jirgas (a council of tribal elders). \nConsistent application of such a process will reinforce the message of community participation. If \naccomplished from the earliest stage as part of the project design, this need not be a source of \nconflict or misunderstanding within tribal groups. Community facilitation staff will be responsible \nfor  establishing  dialogue  with  stakeholders,  and  for  continued  monitoring  of  community \ninvolvement  during  implementation.  The  most  effective  technique  for  guaranteeing  wide \ndissemination of benefits is to maintain transparent processes for activity selection, expenditure \nreporting, and O&M of the various subprojects. \n   \n ", "18   \n62.  The quality of project management and administration, and the ability of the Governor\u2019s \nSecretariat (FATA) to operate smoothly in FATA, depend on strengthening the Secretariat and \nagency  capacities  to  deal  with  large  and  complex  development  programs.  The  Project  will \nprovide assistance in strengthening implementation and financial management capabilities of \nthese agencies through establishment of the PMU and three PIUs. A capacity-building TA (para. \n31)  is  preparing  the  Governor\u2019s  Secretariat  and  agency  line  departments  to  undertake  the \nProject. \n \n63.  Although the economic analysis of the Project indicates a fair degree of robustness, \nachieving the expected project impacts involves some risks. One such risk is whether beneficiary \ncommunities will provide O&M for small infrastructure projects like drinking water schemes and \nirrigation systems, as well as community rangelands and forests. In the past, government-\nfinanced schemes have not attracted community participation in O&M, and the requirement for \nbeneficiaries to own and manage project benefits will be novel. The Project is designed to \nminimize this risk by emphasizing community mobilization during selection, construction, and \nO&M. This responsibility will be clearly explained, and community consensus will be obtained \nprior to the commencement of activities, since communities are more likely to collaborate on \nO&M of schemes that they identify, and that address their expressed needs. With subprojects \nthat are solely the responsibility of the direct beneficiaries (i.e., drinking water tubewells or \nshallow dug wells, small irrigation schemes, and ponds), the Project will also ease the burden on \nbeneficiaries of undertaking full O&M responsibility from the outset, by initially supporting O&M \non a declining percentage basis, with the beneficiaries assuming the full cost by year 5. These \narrangements are more explicitly explained in Appendix 16. Line departments will undertake \nO&M for larger scale infrastructure. Additionally, the Project includes institutional strengthening \nof extension line agencies as well as training of community members. \n  \n64.  The Project will rely on contractors to do much of the construction work for roads, \nirrigation,  and  water  supply.  Since  outside  contractors  can  receive  active  opposition  from \ncommunities, agencies typically use predetermined contractors for small-scale infrastructure. \nWhile they have access to the area, their capabilities are not strong; even the best of such pre-\nselected contractors lack equipment and appropriate technical skills. To reduce the risk of poor \nquality construction, the Project will adopt a process of open, competitive tendering. Contractors \nfrom  outside  the  project  area  will  be  encouraged  to  make  arrangements  to  use  local \nsubcontractors where and as appropriate both to gain entry in areas and find local labor. \nV.

The Government will further ensure \nthat land acquisition/involuntary resettlement, if any, under the Project will be \nundertaken in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, to \nthe satisfaction of ADB, and in accordance with the resettlement framework, as \nagreed between the Government and ADB.  \n(xv)  The Government confirms that no persons will be adversely affected in terms of \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People, as amended from time to time. In the event \nadverse  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  identified  during  project \nimplementation, an indigenous peoples development plan will be prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People. \n ", "20   \n(xvi)  The Government will ensure timely and effective implementation of the gender \nstrategy and plan developed by the Government in consultation with ADB and will \nfurther  ensure  that,  based  on  satisfactory  performance,  the  requisite  female \ntechnical staff engaged for the purposes of the Project will be regularized after \ncompletion of the Project. \n(xvii)  The Government will facilitate access to public documents of immediate relevance \nto the Project and will ensure that all documents and information relating to the \nProject will be in the public domain and freely accessible to the stakeholders and \nother interested parties. \n(xviii)  The Government confirms that customary arrangements exist between Pakistan \nand Afghanistan for withdrawal of water by Pakistan from the Kabul River where \nthe river is the boundary between Pakistan and Afghanistan and that it has and \nwill remain to have the right and ability to withdraw a minimum of approximately \n0.2 cubic meter/second of water needed for the proposed Shalman water supply \nscheme.  \n(xix)  Prior to the commencement of the proposed Shalman water supply scheme, the \nGovernment will carry out (i) a detailed socioeconomic survey to identify the target \nbeneficiaries  of  the  proposed  scheme,  which  will,  among  others,  carefully, \nexamine the willingness of the target beneficiaries to pay water charges; (ii) an \nenvironmental assessment and resettlement/land acquisition plan based on the \ndetailed designs, to be approved by the appropriate government agencies in \nPakistan and by ADB; and (iii) an economic analysis of the scheme.  \n  \nB.

The  rural  sector  underpins  the  economic  and  social  structure  of  the  economy  of \nPakistan. Approximately 77% of the population and the vast majority of the nation's poor reside \nin rural areas. Most derive their living from agriculture and off-farm employment. Agriculture \nremains  the  single  largest  sector  of  the  economy,  and  is  the  most  important  sector  for \nemployment and income generation. The sector accounts for about 26% of real gross domestic \nproduct and approximately 50% of employment. Growth in the sector has been stagnating over \nthe past few years, though it is likely to remain the primary contributor for some time. An \nuncertain policy environment (especially concerning the prices and marketing of major crops) \ncombined  with  widespread  resource  degradation  has  contributed  to  low  productivity  and \nprofitability.  Other  contributors  to  the  sector's  performance  include  low-quality  inputs,  poor \nquality  of  support  services,  inefficient  water  resource  management,  inadequate  rural \ninfrastructure, and deteriorating natural resource base. \n \n2.  Poverty  reduction  is  the  key  objective  of  the  Government's  economic  policies.  The \nGovernment's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper1 emphasizes improving productivity and rural \ninfrastructure as necessary conditions for achieving rapid rural economic growth and poverty \nreduction, given that two thirds of the population is rural. The Government's 2003 official poverty \nline is estimated at PRs748 per capita per month.2 Head-count ratio estimates indicate that \npoverty  had  been  rising  steadily,  with  some  reduction  noted  in  2003.  Rural  poverty  was \nestimated as 38.7%, which is considerably higher than urban areas (22.4%). The decrease in \npoverty for 2003 resulted from macroeconomic stability and near elimination of external account \nvulnerability resulting in a growth rate of 5.1% in 2003 as compared with 3.4% in 2002 and 2.2% \nin  2001.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  based  on  the  following  major \nguidelines:  (i)  accelerating  economic  growth  and  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability;  (ii) \ninvesting in human capital through reforms in education, health, and population welfare by \ninvolving private sector and nongovernment organizations; (iii) developing small- and medium-\nsized enterprises and microfinance in the country to lead to rural development encompassing all \nthe sectors of the rural economy like agriculture, irrigation, livestock including fisheries, and \nelectrification; and (iv) improving governance through reforms that facilitate administrative and \npolitical devolution, access to justice and information, and fiscal decentralization. \n \n3.  Agricultural activity in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is opportunistic, \ntaking advantage of streams and underground water, often in very narrow valleys with suitable \nsoil conditions. Productive agricultural lands are web-like, following the valley floors as far up \ninto the hills as nature will allow, with constructed terraces extending the pattern of agriculture \nfurther to land relying on sporadic rainfall. The few wider valley floors rely on the few tubewells \nor sporadic rains to produce grain crops. Rangelands with some grass and shrubs, and oak \nforests in the higher elevations add to the area\u2019s productive potential. A striking feature of the \nproject  area  is  the  difference  in  biophysical  environment  within  the  three  agencies.  High \nmountain ridges, elevation differences among valley floors, and positioning relative to major \nweather patterns result in substantial variation among microclimates in the various valleys that \ncomprise the three agencies. Conditions range from very arid with no perennial surface water \nand little natural vegetation, as was observed in Khyber and Mohmand, to other areas with \nseveral perennial streams and rivers and numerous natural springs as observed in Bajaur. \n                                                 \n1  Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan. 2003.

Infrastructure  has  improved  in  recent  years,  particularly  road  access.  However,  a \nsignificant part of the area still does not have adequate market access by road. Drinking water \nsourced from within the village is available to 60\u201370% of households, but the volume and quality \nare not high. About a third of these households have water within their house compounds either \npiped or by well. Electricity lines exist and more than half the households have formal access to \nelectricity, but many cannot afford it, or will not pay the price; about one quarter of households \nconsider electricity as a major source of energy. In isolated areas and among poorer people, \ncow dung and wood are the sources of cooking fuel, with 50% (Khyber) to 70% (Bajaur) of \nhouseholds relying on firewood and dung. Irrigation water is much sought after and creates an \nincome surplus for those with access to it, but irrigation systems are not efficient, irrigation \npractices are wasteful and the water table continues to subside, either as a result of drought or \nbecause of existing tubewells draining the localized aquifer. \n \n5.  Exogenous and endogenous factors constrain the ability of households in the FATA to \nmake significant improvements in their livelihoods are diverse and interdependent. Exogenous \nfactors include the following:  \n \n(i)  poor natural resource base in large segments of FATA; \n(ii)  area remoteness due to difficult mountainous terrain and topography;  \n(iii)  FATA  has  provided  a  buffer  zone  between  the  successive  governments  of \nPakistan and Afghanistan over the last five decades, and earlier when the British \nruled the Indian subcontinent; and  \n(iv)  war and unsettled conditions have persisted in Afghanistan for the last 25 years. \n \n6.  Endogenous factors include the following: \n \n(i)  limited area access in some parts of FATA due to security considerations; \n(ii)  limited availability of development funds;   \n(iii)  limited road network in some parts of FATA; \n(iv)  limited participation of civil society in development activities because of local \nadministration managing tribal affairs mostly through tribal maliks (heads); \n(v)  little or no involvement of the female population in decision making even though \nthey are significantly involved in agriculture sector related activities; \n(vi)  ineffective centralized decision-making process for planning and implementation \nof  projects  since  these  are  removed  from  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  the \nbeneficiaries; \n(vii)  limited or nonexistent monitoring of activities and outputs; and  \n(viii)  weak  capacity  of  government  line  agencies  working  in  FATA  for  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring development interventions. \n \n7.  A defining feature of the tribal areas is the continuing importance of its elders and \nleaders, the maliks. Operating without their agreement, support, and protection is difficult to \nimpossible. Not surprisingly, these leaders either own or control a large part of the economic \nresources and government investments in their areas. In such a circumstance, the availability of \n                                                 \n3  Although all agencies have differing conditions within them, Bajaur generally has the most abundant water \nresources, while Mohmand is generally considered the driest. \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nbenefits can be an issue for poverty reduction, where selection criteria are not followed and \nsignificant  portions  of  the  local  population  are  excluded  from  decision-making  or  benefits. \nExcluding the better-off members of communities from receiving benefits is not possible or \ndesirable, but access to opportunities must be distributed equitably. Within the existing \u201cmaliki\u201d \nsystem, the poorest residents of communities and especially women do not normally get a \nchance to improve their material well-being. Achieving broad distribution of project benefits \nrequires that implementing agencies adhere to regular project monitoring and consultation with \nbeneficiaries to reinforce the message of broad participation. Accomplished from the earliest \nstage,  and  as  part  of  the  project  design,  this  need  not  be  a  source  of  conflict  or \nmisunderstanding  within  tribal  groups.  Community  facilitation  staff  are  responsible  for \nestablishing dialogue with stakeholders, and ensuring that participation is not limited. The most \neffective technique for guaranteeing wide dissemination of benefits is to maintain transparent \nprocesses for activity selection. \n \n8.  The Government recognizes that FATA residents live in dehumanizing poverty, with an \nobsolete  administrative  system  and  highly  stratified  social  and  economic  structures.  FATA \nneeds to be integrated into the national economic mainstream and to benefit from the economic \ngrowth and improved services the Government is bringing about with the successful reform \nprogram launched more than 3 years ago. The Government has devised a four-prong strategy \nto translate this objective into reality: (i) empowering people through the process of devolution \nas soon as the conditions are conducive; (ii) reinvigorating public institutions that are cost \neffective, efficient, and responsive to the people by restructuring government departments and \nlaw enforcement agencies; (iii) reforming the judiciary by revamping the judicial system; and (iv) \nsupporting  economic  development  through  special  development  packages  to  improve \nsocioeconomic indicators and reduce poverty.  \n \n9.  The project interventions focus on building sustainable changes in the quality of life of \nbeneficiaries and are fully consistent with the Pakistan Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) poverty reduction strategy, and the ADB country strategy. The Project \nwill improve roads and irrigation infrastructure, and assist communities to gain access to clean \ndrinking water and alternative energy sources. The ability of communities to address their own \nneeds and participate in planning for development will increase through the establishment of \ncommunity-based organizations. Demand for services articulated by these groups will assist \ngovernment agencies in providing infrastructure and technological information. Area wide plans \nwithin the crucial framework of watershed management will integrate infrastructure, natural \nresource  development,  and  capacity  building.  Gender  issues  will  be  addressed  through \nagreement  with  communities  on  ways  to  address  gender-related  concerns  and  interests. \nPlanning, management, and coordination assistance will guide effective and integrated use of \nproject resources and facilitate FATA's incorporation into the economic and political mainstream \nof Pakistan. \n \n \n \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \nProject  Funding Agencies  Amount  Approval \n  ($ million)  Year \nSustainable Livelihood in Barani Areas  ADB  41.0  2004 \n \nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP)  World Bank  37.1  2004 \nCommunity Infrastructure II \n \nSecond Poverty Alleviation Fund Project  World Bank  230.0  2003 \n \nSindh Rural Development Project  ADB  50.0  2002 \n \nNWFP On-Farm Water Management Project  World Bank  21.4  2001 \n \nNWFP Barani Area Development Project \u2013  ADB, International  52.0  2000 \nPhase II  Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment \n \nSouth FATA Development Project  IFAD   17.0  2000 \n \nBajaur Area Development Project  Narcotics Affairs  4.0  2000 \nSection of the \nGovernment of the \nUnited States  \n \nMohmand Area Development Project  NAS    2000 \n \nKhyber Area Development Project  NAS    2000 \n \nMalakand Rural Development Project  ADB  41.0  1999 \n \nBarani Village Development Project (Punjab)  IFAD   15.3  1999 \n \nDir Area Support Project   IFAD   13.0  1997 \n \nDera Ghazi Khan Rural Development Project  ADB  36.0  1997 \n \nBahawalpur Rural Development Project  ADB, Islamic  45.0  1996 \nDevelopment Bank \n \nNWFP Barani Area Development Project  ADB  32.8  1992 \n \nMansehra Village Support Project  IFAD   14.5  1992 \n \nKalam Integrated Rural Development Project,  Swiss Agency for  3.5  1992 \nNWFP (Phase IV)  Development \nCooperation \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FATA = Federally Administered Tribal Areas, IFAD = International Fund for \nAgricultural Development, NAS = Narcotics Affairs Section (of the Government of the United States), NWFP = North-\nWest Frontier Province.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \nINFRASTRUCTURE SUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA \nA.  Drinking Water Supply Schemes \n1.  The  water  supply  schemes  are  recommended  to  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  the \nfollowing selection criteria:  \n \n(i)  The water source/location should be free of conflicts and villagers must allow \naccess to all potential beneficiaries.  \n(ii)  The scheme must satisfy a minimum water requirement of 45 liters/capita/day \n(10 gallons/capita/day) for the design period of 20 years.  \n(iii)  The scheme should exclusively serve the drinking water needs. However where \nthe discharge capacity is more than the drinking water requirements, the excess \nwater may be diverted for irrigation.  \n(iv)  The village organization must agree to provide implementation management, \nlabor, and local materials free of cost; and ensure maintenance through own \nsources after scheme completion. \n \nB.  Irrigation Systems \n2.  Criteria for selecting irrigation subprojects include the following: \n \n(i)  The schemes should be free of conflict with regard to land or water rights. \n(ii)  The village organization must ensure equity. (For example the construction of \nsurface irrigation schemes must benefit all potential farmers and not just those \nlocated at the head reaches.)  \n(iii)  Villagers must provide land and to the extent possible local materials and labor \nfree of cost.   \n(iv)  Development of surface irrigation schemes must be assessed for its impact on \ndownstream users.  \n(v)  Dugwell- and tubewell-based schemes should only be recommended for farmer \ngroups that are willing to contribute a minimum of 50% of the costs, both capital \nand recurrent. Dug wells should be awarded to groups comprising a minimum of \n4 farmers, while the tubewell-based schemes should be awarded to groups with \na minimum of 8 farmers.  \n(vi)  Land ownership of one farmer should not exceed 25% of the total command area \nunder the scheme.  \n(vii)  Preference should be given to resident landowners as opposed to absentee \nlandowners.  \n(viii)  A minimum of 6 hectares (ha) of land for dug wells and 18 ha of land for \ntubewell-based schemes must be available to justify costs.  \n(ix)  Aquifer discharge must yield a minimum of 1 liter per second/ha to satisfy crop \nwater requirements.  \n(x)  Dugwells or tubewells should not be sunk within the influence area of existing \nwells.   \n \nC.  Irrigation Ponds and Small Reservoirs \n3.  Selection criteria include the following:  \n \n(i)  Small  reservoir  facilities  should  be  sited  in  areas  with  greater  than  75% \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nprobability that design fill capacity will be met on an annual basis. \n(ii)  Development  of  small  reservoir  facilities  and  ponds  should  not  affect  water \nsupplies (ground and surface) currently exploited for domestic or other productive \nuses unless compensation schemes agreeable to all parties can be devised. \n(iii)  Small  reservoirs  and  ponds  should  be  sited  to  minimize  conveyance  and \nevaporative losses and measures taken to minimize loss of the resource. \n(iv)  Labor-intensive construction techniques should be used and local community \nmembers  and  beneficiaries  should  be  employed  or  contribute  labor  to \ndevelopment activities. \n(v)  Small reservoirs and ponds must be developed with one or more associated \ncommunity  to  contribute  labor  for  annual  maintenance  activities  that  can  be \nfulfilled with their resources. \n(vi)  For  selected  storages  and  ponds,  communities  should  agree  to  voluntarily \nprovide land for both construction of the storage facility, the inundation area, \nmain canals to irrigation areas, and any appurtenant structures. Sites should be \nselected to minimize the loss of any productive resources, especially cultivable \nland, from development of the facility. \n(vii)  Small reservoirs should only be developed in areas where more cost-effective \nand less disruptive water supplies (such as groundwater) cannot be developed \nand dams should be restricted to a maximum height of 6 meters. \n(viii)  Development  of  small  reservoirs  and  ponds  must  meet  all  social  and \nenvironmental safeguard policies, and no project will be undertaken that involves \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \n(ix)  Small reservoirs must be developed with international best practice for safety and \nshould not increase flood risk to local communities. \n \nD.  Low-Cost Link Roads \n4.  Selection criteria include the following: \n \n(i)  A low-cost link road should aim to serve a minimum of three villages with an \naverage population of 2,500. The second category of roads (i.e., upgrading of \nexisting roads) should satisfy a similar requirement prior to selection under the \nProject.   \n(ii)  The targeted cluster (of villages) should preferably have agricultural potential that \ncould be exploited with the provision of a new or improved road.   \n(iii)  The proposed roads should not be an isolated (or unconnected) section and \nmust link with other district or provincial road networks.   \n(iv)  Road lengths, providing missing links and improving the connectivity of an area, \nshould be given priority.  \n(v)  In deciding between new roads and improvements to existing tracks, priority \nshould be given to large population clusters totally unconnected with any road \nnetwork.  \n(vi)  Communities must agree to maintain and repair the jeepable tracks through a \nvillage self-help or local maintenance and repair fund contributed by beneficiary \nhouseholds.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  29 \nSHALMAN TO LANDI KOTAL WATER SUPPLY SCHEME IN KHYBER AGENCY \n1.  The  proposed  Shalman  to  Landi  Kotal  water  supply  scheme  is  expected  to  serve \napproximately 78,000 people by 2030. The population in the coverage area is about 31,700, of \nwhich 30\u201340% are estimated to be associated with the military scouts (9,500\u201312,000) and \nresiding in the cantonment area. The military needs are about the same as the available water \nfrom two existing sources. Currently the water shortage is acute as the needs are estimated to \nbe 5.7 million liters/day and only about 946,000 liters/day are available from rapidly depleting \nsources; thus only 17% of user needs is being met. As a result, the military cantonment could \ndivert all of the water from the existing sources and thus no water would be available to the \ngeneral public. For many reasons, the water supply is also not being treated on a regular basis \nunless the public health department or hospital informs the operator of large-scale illness in the \ncommunity and then only a few handfuls of powdered chlorine are thrown into the storage \nreservoirs. The design requirements of the proposed scheme have been estimated to be about \n12.5 million liters/day by 2030. The estimated cost of the scheme is about $5.6 million.1 \n \n2.  The entire installation is located in a rather remote region of Khyber Agency, but is \naccessible in about 1 hour by a relatively good black-topped and gravel road from Landi Kotal to \nthe  pump  intake  installation  site  on  the  Kabul  River,  where  the  river  forms  the  boundary \nbetween Afghanistan and Pakistan. Low flows during the dry season are estimated by the \nGovernment to be about 54 cubic-meters/second. The design of the entire system is considered \nto be relatively simple and construction relatively straightforward. The system will draw water \nfrom a series of infiltration galleries along the Kabul River, pump up the hills through a series of \nin-line pumping stations, to a reservoir located on the top of the hill. From the top of the hill, the \nflow is then gravity to a series of storage tank reservoirs. The design intake of .20 cubic \nmeter/second  is  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  low  discharge  and  thus  should  not  affect \ndownstream riparian rights to the water.  \n \n3.  The primary infiltration gallery, with intake discharge of .20 cubic meter/second, is based \non  various  demands,  losses,  and  user  requirements  as  determined  by  standards  used  in \nPakistan. The intake would be installed underground on the right bank of the Kabul River \n(Pakistan side) and include an infiltration chamber and piping to a pumping chamber for the \nprimary  pumping  plant.  On-line  intermediate  pumping  stations  with  two  main  lines  will  be \nconstructed including small tank reservoirs, and one additional storage tank reservoir at the top \nof the Anzari Top hill. From the Anzari Top tank reservoir, piping will be provided to existing \nstorage tanks. Improvements will be required for the existing distribution system and pumping \nfacilities.  \n \n4.  Prior to Asian Development Bank (ADB) approval for scheme financing, the following \nconditions will be met: \n \n(i)  A socioeconomic survey will be undertaken to identify the target population of the \nservice area of Landi Kotal town and other served areas, particularly the military \nand general public, as well as Afghan refugees. As part of the socioeconomic \nsurvey, a review will determine willingness to pay by the beneficiaries (water \nservice  fees).  In  addition,  based  on  the  detailed  designs  an  environmental \nassessment  and  resettlement/land  acquisition  plan  will  be  prepared  and \n                                                 \n1  Based on 2004 cost estimates PRs318,145,000 without inflation or contingencies.

An \neconomic analysis will also be carried out. \n \n(ii)  As typical for urban water supply schemes, an equitable water tariff plan will have \nto be determined and possibly a new collection agency or authority considered to \ncover all or a portion of the anticipated operation and maintenance costs. To \nmeasure water used and fees, water measuring meters or similar devices should \nbe considered for each connection. \n \n(iii)  To meet health requirements, water treatment will be part of the system with an \nautomatic chlorination injection system installed and stockpiles of a sufficient \nsupply of liquid chlorine guaranteed to the operator. The volume of chlorine \ninjected into the system will be determined based on best principles of treating \npotable water. \n \n(iv)  For safety purposes, mainline flow-metering devices, pressure control valves, \nmanually operated closure valves, and other safety devices will be installed to \nprovide safety to the system in case of unexpected shutdowns, repairs, and \nroutine maintenance. \n \n(v)  As part of the review process and prior to ADB approval, an expert panel of \nconsultants will review the overall plans, detailed designs and implementation \nplans, and environmental needs with particular emphasis on the mechanical-\nelectrical equipment and distribution system. \n ", "  Appendix 6  31 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Resettlement Policy Framework \n1.  The Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (as amended) is the core legislation used in Pakistan \nfor acquiring private lands for a public purpose. As with most other laws of Pakistan, the act is \nnot  applicable  to  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas  (FATA).  Local  needs  for  land \nacquisition  are  addressed  through  the  tribal  system  of  land  rights  and  distribution.  In  the \nabsence of a formal legal policy for land acquisition and resettlement, a project-specific set of \nresettlement principles consistent with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy requirements has \nbeen adopted for the Project. In general terms, the people affected will be compensated for the \nloss of their land and trees, and assisted financially to restore their affected structures/assets \nand  livelihoods,  at  least  to  pre-project  levels.  Households  headed  by  women  and  other \nvulnerable households will be eligible for further cash assistance for relocation and house or \nstructure reconstruction. Plans for subproject resettlement will be based on a full evaluation of \nthe impact of proposals and contain a complete list of all those affected together with the type \nand size of losses, along with the amount of compensation and/or financial assistance assessed \nfor each person affected.  \nB.  Institutional Framework  \n2.  The Governor\u2019s Secretariat (FATA) and the political administrations (the political agents\u2019 \noffices) of the Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand agencies are familiar with the procedure and \npractice of land acquisition. FATA resettlement will be conducted through a land acquisition and \nresettlement cell (LARC), which will be established in the Peshawar-based project management \nunit. The LARC will be headed by a chief resettlement officer (grade-18 officer) and will be \nassisted in field by three agency resettlement officers. For each of the three subareas, the \nBajaur,  Khyber,  and  Mohmand  agencies  will  have  a  political  tehsildar  assigned  to  attend \nspecifically to the project-related land acquisition and resettlement activities.  \n3.  Currently, these government agencies do not have the capacity to plan and implement \nthe resettlement activities as desired by ADB because they lack the expertise required for \nplanning and implementing involuntary resettlement under ADB policy and guidelines. To fill in \nthe gap, a resettlement specialist will be included in the supervisory consultants team for the \nentire project period, to provide the necessary technical assistance for the PMU and agencies, \non a continual basis. In addition, a nongovernment organization (NGO) hired by the Project to \nprovide assistance in community organization/participation activities will also be responsible for \nproviding  assistance  to  the  LARC,  under  the  guidance  of  resettlement  specialist,  in \nimplementing the resettlement plans in an effective manner. It will have a specific role to play in \ninformation  disclosure  and  conflict  resolution  pursuits,  especially  in  matters  related  to \nentitlements and compensation payments to people affected. The NGO will also be responsible \nfor ensuring that all procedures for voluntary land donated under the Project are conducted in a \ntransparent manner and that land is donated without duress. \nC.  Resettlement Procedural Guidelines \n4.  Specific  resettlement  procedure  guidelines  have  been  established  to  guide  the \npreparation of appropriate resettlement plans that will be adequate for the magnitude of the land \nacquisition for subsequent subprojects. These resettlement procedure guidelines require that: (i) \nthe LARC agency resettlement officers/to carry out an initial social assessment survey once the \nscope of each subproject is identified, based on its preliminary technical designs; (ii) if impacts \n ", "32  Appendix 6 \nare found to be \u201csignificant,\u201d the LARC will prepare a full resettlement plan for each subproject; \nand (iii) if subproject impacts are less than significant (i.e., affecting less than 200 people or \naffecting households that lose less than 10% of their productive assets), a short resettlement \nplan will be prepared. Both full and short resettlement plans will comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement and other social safeguard guidelines. \nD.  Compensation Principles and Entitlements \n5.

Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n6.  Each resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the \nstakeholders,  and  involve  focus  group  discussions  and  meetings,  particularly  with  people \naffected by the Project. The resettlement policy framework will be made available in the Urdu \nlanguage and explained in Pashto language during focus group village meetings. Copies of draft \nresettlement  plans  will  be  distributed  among  community  groups  for  local  inputs  prior  to \nfinalization of the detailed design, and after the socioeconomic survey has been carried out to \navoid  fraudulent  claims.  Complaints  and  grievance  procedures  will  be  outlined  in  each \nresettlement plan and grievance redress committees will be established at each agency for \nsubprojects.  This  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  political  agent,  assisted  by  a  political \ntehsildar, with representatives from the LARC, line departments, those affected, and project \nNGOs. For all disputes other than those relating to legal ownership rights, the committee will \nreview  grievances  involving  all  resettlement  benefits,  relocation,  and  other  assistance. \nGrievances will be redressed within 2\u20134 weeks from the date of lodging the complaints. \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n7.  The LARC will establish an internal monitoring system involving the agency resettlement \nofficer/political tehsildar and implementing staff. They will prepare monthly internal progress \nreports on all aspects of land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement activities. The LARC \nheadquarters will report to the project director and ADB on land acquisition and resettlement in \nthe quarterly progress report. \nG.  Implementation Schedule \n8.  Although land acquisition is a complex and lengthy process in Pakistan, land acquisition \nis expected to be formalized quickly because of the land required and priority given to the \nProject by the Government. Land acquisition should be completed within 1 year. \nH.  Resettlement Budget and Financing  \n9.  An  indicative  budget  for  the  Project\u2019s  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  has  been \nprepared for the allocation of funds prior to the start of project activities (Table A6.2). These \nbudget estimates include all the costs related to land acquisition, compensation, resettlement \nassistance,  training  of  staff,  hiring  of  NGOs  and  consultants,  and  internal  monitoring  of \nimplementation of the resettlement plan.  \nTable A6.2: Summary Resettlement Budgeta \nNo.  Description  PRs million  $ million \n1  Land Compensation (including crops and trees)            159.6              2.7  \n2  Compensation for Affected Structures (shops, houses,                6.0              0.1  \nlivestock sheds, other) \n3  Financial  Assistance  to  Tenants  and  Vulnerable People              3.0              0.1  \n(widows, disabled) \n    Subtotal (1+2+3)            168.6              2.9  \n4  Hiring of Resettlement Specialist (technical assistance)                4.8              0.1  \n5  Hiring of Panel of Experts for Monitoring and Evaluation                2.5              0.0  \n    Subtotal (4+5)                7.3              0.1  \n    Subtotal (1+2+3+4+5)            175.9              3.0  \n6  Contingencies (10% of total identified costs)              17.6              0.3  \n        Total            193.5              3.3  \na Exchange rate: PRs59.70 = $1.00. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nI.

Proposed consulting services are required to provide specialized inputs for which adequate \ntechnical  capabilities  are  not  available  in  the  line  departments  (Table  A12).  Water  resource \ndevelopment and conservation is a key input and most of the consulting inputs address water \nresource and watershed planning and management, establishing suitable engineering standards \nand quality control, establishing monitoring and measurement facilities as required, undertaking \ntechnical  designs,  assessing  economic,  environmental  and  social  viability  of  interventions, \nundertaking general monitoring and evaluation, and undertaking community forestry activities. A \ntotal  of  147  person-months  of  consulting  services  inputs,  comprising  21  person-months  of \ninternational  and  126  person-months  of  domestic,  will  be  engaged  through  a  consulting \nconsortium. In addition, 2 person-months of individual consulting services inputs are required to \nserve on a review panel for the proposed Shalman to Landi Kotal water supply scheme. \n \n2.  In addition to the proposed consulting services specified in Table A12, technical assistance \n(through service contracts) is needed for: (i) a baseline survey; (ii) community mobilization activities \nand a public information campaign; (iii) periodic independent audits of project performance; (iv) a \nsurface- and groundwater assessment study; and (v) establishment and implementation of the \nproject management information system. The baseline survey will be undertaken in the first year \nand  be  the  basis  for  designing  the  project  management  information  system.  The  community \nmobilization and information dissemination program will be aimed at involving beneficiaries in \nproject  activities  from  the  outset.  Line  departments  and  project  staff  will  receive  training  in \ncommunity  facilitation  and  mobilization  prior  to  commencing  work  with  communities.  Periodic \nindependent performance audits will be undertaken to strengthen governance measures adopted \nby the project. The water resources assessment study (surface and groundwater sources in the \nthree agencies) will evaluate existing information and provide critical information for identification \nand  location/design  of  new  water  resources  structures,  particularly  for  the  installation  of  any \nproposed deep tubewells. The project management information system will be established to \nmonitor physical and financial progress as well as to assess the development impacts of the \nproject.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Rural Development Project is designed \nto enhance rural livelihoods in three of the FATA agencies: Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand. \nProject  components  include  resource  management  activities  in  agriculture,  livestock,  and \nforestry;  as  well  as  infrastructure  investments  in  irrigation,  rural  roads,  and  drinking  water \nfacilities.  Given  the  interaction  between  elements  of  forestry,  livestock,  and  agriculture, \nproposed project interventions will be concentrated in chosen micro-watersheds within the three \nagencies. As such, specific project interventions have not yet been chosen. Instead, selection \ncriteria  have  been  devised  for  prospective  micro-watersheds,  as  well  as  for  potential \ninterventions within those watersheds. Project implementation will be difficult and rely on a team \nof community mobilizers to work closely with target beneficiaries and line department officials. \n \nB.  Project Benefits  \n \n2.  Benefits and costs are examined both in economic and financial terms to look at not only \nthe economic viability of the Project but also the expected impact on various sectors of local \nsociety. Project investments are planned over 5 years. The life of the Project, however, is \nexpected to be for 20 years after the time of a particular intervention. For this analysis, the costs \nof each intervention as well as its benefits are calculated for two alternative situations: \u201cwith\u201d the \nProject and \u201cwithout\u201d the Project.  \n \nC.  Economic Pricing \n \n3.  Financial prices used in this analysis were identified through a survey of the project area \nconducted by the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) team. To assess the Project\u2019s \ncontributions to the Pakistan economy financial values must be converted into their economic \nequivalents. Basic assumptions used in the economic part of the analysis include \n \n(i)  the use of a domestic price numeraire; \n(ii)  values are expressed in constant 2004 prices to exclude inflation; \n(iii)  the Pakistan rupee (PRe) is the unit of account; the exchange rate used is \nPRs59.7 = $1;1 \n(iv)  economic values for major tradable commodities (notably major food grains as \nwell as fertilizers and milk) are based on border parity prices, and a standard \nconversion factor of 0.9 is used for nontraded goods and services; and a shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.8 is used for male labor and 0.7 for female labor; and \n(v)  transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies are excluded in the calculation of \neconomic values. \n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n \n4.  Economic analyses were performed for each of the six project subcomponents. Results \n(and pertinent methodologies used) for these subcomponent analyses are described here. \nCosts applied to these subcomponents include both the costs of direct investment (in crop \ndemonstrations, training, infrastructure, etc.) as well as implementation costs of the appropriate \n                                                 \n1  This was the exchange rate in September 2005. \n ", "44  Appendix 13 \nline agencies involved. Only the costs of the project management unit and agency project \nimplementation units are included in the calculation of over-all project returns. Benefits have \nbeen phased in according to the date of expected investments and (for the farming, livestock, \nand irrigation models) scheduled to take a few years to reach their expected potential.2 \n \n5.  Farming Systems and Crop Production. This intervention will involve the introduction \nof improved seed technology and farming demonstration plots, adaptive research trials, field \nscreening for appropriate varieties, integrated crop management training, farmer field days, and \ntraining of extension staff. Approximately 52,500 ha are expected to be affected. Based on \nincremental net crop income, this subcomponent is expected to be economically viable.  The \neconomic net present value (ENPV) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) are displayed \nin Table A13 (along with the results of all the other subcomponents. The ENPV is PRs 402.3 \nmillion ($6.9 million) while the EIRR is 37.3%. \n \n6.  The economic analysis of the subcomponent is based on the assumption that benefits \nand costs over the life of the Project will be as calculated. The future, of course, may not \nperfectly follow that assumption. Sensitivity tests regarding specific alternative assumptions are \nalso detailed in Table A13. They include tests for risks of (i) an increase in investment cost, (ii) \nbenefit shortfalls, (iii) yield decreases, (iv) product price decreases, (v) a shortfall in project \nimplementation, and (vi) a decrease in the project life. For each risk variable the EIRR is \nrecalculated assuming a 20% change. The switching value for that variable (beyond which the \nEIRR would fall below 12%) and a sensitivity measure are also calculated.3 The base EIRR for \nthis subcomponent was sufficiently high that none of the risk variables would appear to seriously \nthreaten the viability of the intervention. Overall, the farming systems and crop production \nsubcomponent should show strong returns.  \n \n7.  Livestock  and  Fodder  Development.  The  Project  plans  interventions  to  improve \nanimal husbandry practices and feed management. Activities will include fodder production \ndemonstration  plots,  training  of  village  animal  husbandry  extension  workers,  and  exposing \nfarmers to improved techniques through farmer field days and visits to public-sector livestock \ninstitutions. Livestock staff will also be trained. Benefits to livestock will also accrue from the \nrange management portion of the forestry subcomponent. Forty-six thousand households are \nexpected  to  ultimately  benefit  from  this  program.  This  subcomponent  is  expected  to  be \neconomically viable with an ENPV of PRs77.8 million ($1.3 million) and an EIRR of 17.8 %. \nSensitivity tests performed covered similar risks already discussed (Table A13). None of these \nrisk variables showed the potential to seriously threaten this subcomponent\u2019s returns. \n \n8.  Community Forestry and Range Management. The community forestry and range \nmanagement  subcomponent  includes  the  establishment  of  both  farmer-managed  and \ndepartment-managed  nurseries,  as  well  as  farmer-,  community-,  and  department-managed \nforest plantations. Quantified benefits include the production of these enterprises. In addition, \ngiven the environmental benefits of forest establishment and stabilization, an attempt has been \nmade  to  quantify  the  value  of  a  decrease  in  the  without-project  rate  of  environmental \n                                                 \n2  The full economic analysis can be found in Supplementary Appendix H. \n3  Sensitivity is the absolute value of the percent change in the EIRR divided by the percent change in the risk factor. \nA sensitivity level that is greater than 1.0 indicates that a percent change in the risk factor will cause a change in \nthe EIRR of more than 1% of its base case value indicating a relatively high degree of sensitivity to the risk. The \nopposite is the case when the sensitivity measure is less than 1.0. \n ", "  Appendix 13  45 \ndegradation.4 The community forestry and range management program is expected to have an \nENPV of PRs244.5 million ($ 4.2 million) and an EIRR of 17.5%. These results indicate a \ndegree of economic viability. Sensitivity tests were performed on the usual cost, benefit, yield, \nprice, level of implementation, and project life risk variables, as well as on the environmental \nbenefit estimate. Again, none of these variables appear to bring great cause for concern. \n \n9.  Irrigation Development. The irrigation interventions include a variety of schemes\u2014\nsmall ponds, new and rehabilitated surface systems, tubewells, dug wells, small check dams, \nand slightly larger delayed action dams. Irrigation allows farmers to adopt higher value crops \nand a higher cropping intensity. While marketing of higher value crops may be an issue, areas \nin  the  agencies  recently  opened  up  with  rural  roads  have  shown  a  good  increase  in  the \nproduction of vegetables for the Peshawar market. The marketing potential is growing. \n \n10.  For the various types of schemes combined, the EIRR is 14.6% and the ENPV is \nPRs88.1 ($1.5 million). Sensitivity tests indicate that modest negative changes in a number of \nthe  benefit,  cost,  yield,  and  price  risk  variables  may  threaten  the  viability  of  the  irrigation \nsubcomponent. While the sensitivity values of these risks are not all high (except for vegetable \nyields), the base case EIRR is sufficiently close to the 12% critical level as to make these \nvariables  a  real  risk  to  subproject  viability.  During  project  implementation,  an  especially \nimportant activity will be ensuring that farmers see the value of adopting crop technologies that \nirrigation makes possible and that they understand the importance of maintaining their systems \nwith proper operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n \n11.  Road Construction and Upgrading. The construction of new shingle roads (and the \nupgrading of others) will better link communities to main roads and the outside economy and \nservices (such as educational and health facilities). This will make communication easier and \ngreatly  decrease  the  cost  of  transporting  rural  inputs  and  production.  Based  on  vehicle \noperating costs and passenger time savings, the shingle roads program is expected to be \neconomically viable. The EIRR is 16.5% and the ENPV is PRs124.4. Sensitivity tests show no \nmajor threats to viability. \n \n12.  Drinking Water Supply. Many FATA communities have problems with drinking water \navailability  and  quality.  The  Project  will  help  build  a  number  of  domestic  water  schemes, \nincluding  dug-well,  gravity-flow,  tubewell,  and  hand-pump  systems.  Benefits  from  these \nschemes include decreased water-fetching times (primarily involving women) and improvements \nin the health of household members using safer water with the Project. 5 The EIRR is 31.0% and \nthe ENPV is PRs302.0 million ($5.2 million); none of the risk variables tested appeared to pose \na major threat to viability. This subcomponent, overall, seems to have solid returns.  \n \n13.  Overall Project. The six project subcomponent models were combined and project \nimplementation costs included. The EIRR for the Project is 19.1% and the ENVP is PRs1,036.1 \nmillion ($17.7 million). The Project as a whole, as with its subcomponent parts, can be expected \nto have solid economic returns. \n                                                 \n4  Calculations are based on an assumption that without the Project, the level of agricultural and livestock production \n(found in the agriculture and livestock models) will decrease at a rate of 1% per year. A project benefit is found by \nassuming that project interventions will cause a decrease in that rate of degradation to 0.5%. These assumptions \nwere deemed reasonable, but are not based on any studies or secondary sources. \n5  The proposed Shalman water supply scheme for Landi Kotal in the Khyber Agency (proposed by the Government \nafter the project preparatory TA analysis of the Project) has not been included in this analysis given that a full \nfeasibility analysis (including necessary social and environmental effects) has not yet been completed. \n ", "46  Appendix 13 \nE.  Household Returns and Poverty Implications \n \n14.  Official statistics on rural income and poverty in the FATA area are quite weak. The \nproject preparatory TA effort did include a social survey, but given the social constraints within \nthe FATA agencies the use of a random sample was impossible. Most houses are very private \n(even fortress-like) and gaining access to potential respondents was very difficult and often \nimpossible. Also, the locations of the actual project interventions have not yet been determined, \nso specific information about definite project beneficiaries is unavailable. Nevertheless, it is \nuseful to at least speculate upon how possible project beneficiaries may fare. \n \n15.  The farming systems and crop management subcomponent is expected to affect 52,500 \nhectares (ha). Farm size has been roughly estimated in the three agencies as about 1.4 ha per \nhousehold.  That  would  indicate  about  37,500  beneficiary  households  (or  about  337,500 \npeople6). After a full phasing in of benefits, incremental farm income for these households \nshould increase by about PRs5,900 per year on average.7  \n \n16.  For the irrigation development subcomponent (which also uses incremental crop income \nas its primary benefit), the area coverage is expected to be 6,644 ha. This translates into about \n4,750 households as beneficiaries (or 42,750 people). Per household, incremental income will \nbe about PRs54,900 per year after a full phasing in of irrigation effects.  \n \n17.  The livestock and fodder management subcomponent is aimed at 46,000 households \n(414,000 people). The increase in milk production and animal live weight can be expected to \nbring in a modest PRs1,600 per household annually. \n \n18.  In the community forestry and range management subcomponent, the calculation of \nproject beneficiaries is problematic. Some family seedling nurseries and small plantations will \nparticipate, but the bulk of the benefits are expected to accrue from larger department- and \ncommunity-managed plantations. The environmental benefits will also be communitywide. \n \n19.  Similarly for the rural roads subcomponent, the number of benefiting households is \ndifficult to estimate so a calculation of per household benefits is not very credible.  \n \n20.  For  the  drinking  water  supply  subcomponent,  assumptions  are  made  regarding  the \nhousehold  coverage  of  the  various  types  of  scheme.  By  this  calculation,  about  17,850 \nhouseholds (or 160,650 people) will benefit from decreased water-fetching time and decreased \nhealth costs. Per household, this benefit is valued at about PRs8,400 per year. \n \n21.  Infrastructure O&M as a Beneficiary Household Responsibility. For most of the \nirrigation schemes and all of the drinking water supply schemes, the responsibility for O&M will \nlie with the beneficiary households. For the drinking water schemes (averaging the four types), \nO&M costs can be expected to be about 10% of the value of the annual household benefit. For \nirrigation schemes, average O&M costs will be about 12.5% of the financial benefits. In both \ncases, sufficient incentives should be provided for the beneficiary communities to make sure \nthat their schemes continue to function well.  \n                                                 \n6  The TA survey indicated that household size is about 9. Some sources raise that to 10 persons per household.  \nNine persons per household is used here. \n7  For financial returns to farm households, farm labor is counted as costless. If, in fact, incremental labor needs \nrequire an increase in hired labor or if some other opportunity cost arises for family members having to put more \ntime into farming activities, this figure will be less. \n ", "  Appendix 13  47 \n \n22.  Employment. Some of the Project\u2019s interventions can be expected to generate long-\nterm incremental employment opportunities. An attempt to quantify this employment effect has \nbeen made. The agriculture program may generate 585,000 incremental labor days per year. \nSome  of  this  labor  will  fall  to  hired  workers,  providing  some  opportunity  for  additional \nhouseholds  to  benefit  from  this  subcomponent.  Similarly,  irrigation  development  can  be \nexpected to increase labor days on farms by 919,500. The forestry and range management \nsubcomponent will hire an average of 123,500 labor days a year.  \n \n23.  Poverty Impacts. Specific information about poverty in the FATA agencies is lacking. \nEstimates for Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand, indicate that the proportion of households living \nbelow the poverty line (currently estimated at PRs774 per person per) is over 60%. In some \ncommunities  it  may  be  as  high  as  80%.  For  such  a  high  proportion  of  the  population,  a \nsignificant number of the poor in the target communities are expected to benefit from the \nProject. Also, given the wide variety of project interventions into the chosen micro-watershed \nlocations, households below the poverty line will get a share.  \n \n24.  Landholders will receive most of the benefits from the farming system and irrigation \nsubcomponents. The project preparatory TA report indicates that the poor own approximately \n57% of all farms (covering 34% of the farm area). For these two subcomponents, then, roughly \none third of the benefits may go to the poor, and three fifths of the beneficiaries will be poor. \n \n25.  Livestock program beneficiaries may or may not own land. The poor are more likely to \nconcentrate on less expensive livestock (goats, sheep, and chickens, rather than cows and \nbuffaloes), but should benefit to some degree. Tribal communities running community forest \nplantations will share the profits among themselves. Employment opportunities may go largely \nto the landless and other poor. \n \n26.  Most members of the communities, including the poor, will benefit from the road and \ndrinking water subcomponents. For the smaller drinking water schemes (hand pumps and dug \nwells, for example) efforts will need to be taken to keep the systems available to the full \ncommunities rather than only to the few households that have taken over the O&M functions. \n \n \n ", " \nTable A13:  Project Level FIRR/EIRR, NPVs, Switching Values, SI, Sensitivity Analysis, and PIRs \n  4\n8\n \nOverall \nFarming  Nursery \nLivestock and  A + B +  Including \nSystem and  Raising  Link  DWS&S  A\nComponent/  Fodder  A+B  Range  Irrigation Microhydel  Project  p\nCrop  And  Roads Schemes  p\nSubcomponent  Development  Management Management  e\nproduction  Plantations  n\nCost  d\nix\n 1\n(A)  (B)  (C)  (D)  (E)  (G)  (H)  (I)  (J)  (K)  3\n \nBase Case (Financial)                               \nBase case FIRR (percent)  57.8   68.5   62.9  57.9  13.0  25.5  26.0     41.8  22.7 \nBase case NPV  @ 12 %  861.2   973.7   1,835.0  1,801.8  56.4  621.0  347.3     38.0  2,187.2 \nBase Case (Economic)                               \nBase case EIRR (percent)  41.0   55.6   48.7  44.9  11.8  17.4  18.5  44.0  28.0  26.6 \nBase case NPV @ 12 %  459.1   5.8   1,264.9  1,231.7  21.3  208.8  148.2  1,394.2  18.5  2,734.5 \nPIR  0.78   0.64   0.69 0.69 1.06  1.01  0.88 0.68  0.41  0.44 \nSwitching Values                               \nDecrease in benefits (percent)  79.7  87.0  84.2  82.0     32.9  31.8  71.4  73.6  58.1 \nSensitivity Index  1.3  1.1  1.2  1.2     3.0  3.1  1.4     1.7 \nIncrease in costs (percent)  392.5  668.8  532.7  455.2     49.0  46.6  250.1  279.2  138.6 \nSensitivity Index  0.3  0.1  0.2  0.2     2.0  2.1  0.4     0.7 \nSimultaneous  change  in \npercentage  66.2  77.0  72.7  69.5     19.7  18.9  55.6  58.3  40.9 \nSensitivity Analysis                               \n10 % decrease in benefits  38.2  51.8   45.3  41.7  11.2  15.9  16.5  39.8  15.2  24.4 \n20 % decrease in benefits  35.2  47.8   41.8   38.5  10.4  14.2  14.5  35.5  12.0  22.1 \n30 % decrease in benefits  32.1  43.7   38.2  35.1  9.6  12.5  12.4  31.2  8.7  19.6 \n40 % decrease in benefits  28.8  39.3   34.4  31.5  8.6  10.7  10.2  26.8  5.5  17.1 \n50 % decrease in benefits  25.3  34.7   30.2  27.7  7.4  8.6  7.8  22.3  2.2  14.4 \n10 % increase in costs  38.5   52.1   45.6  42.0  11.2  16.0  16.7  40.1  17.1  24.6 \n20 % increase in costs  36.2   49.1   43.0  39.6  0.8  14.8  15.2  36.9  15.7  22.8 \n30 % increase in costs  34.3   46.5   40.7  37.4     13.7  13.9  34.2  14.3  21.3 \n40 % increase in costs  32.6   44.3   38.7  35.6     12.8  12.7  31.8  12.9  20.0 \n50 % increase in costs  31.0   42.2   36.9  33.9     11.9  11.7  29.7  11.4  18.8 \nDWS&S = Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, PIR = \npoverty impact ratio, SI = sensitivity index.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n ", "  Appendix 14  49 \nGENDER STRATEGY AND PLAN \n \n1.  Women in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) play a dominant role in \nrunning  the  household,  rearing  and  guiding  children,  managing  household  finances,  and \nproviding much of the labor for agriculture and animal husbandry. They do not normally have a \npublic  role,  particularly  in  interactions  with  the  broader society.  The  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments recognize the importance of addressing poverty, especially as it affects women. \nWomen\u2019s inclusion in project activities and surveys from the earliest days and early discussion \nwith community elders over including them in project benefits will assist communities to focus on \nproblems  that  especially  affect  women,  such  as  water  availability  and  small-scale  income \ngeneration. Too overt a focus on women\u2019s programs and women\u2019s issues can generate hostility \nwithin communities where elders perceive proposed gender programs as a potential corrupting \nthreat to the local social and cultural fabric. In the event such a problem arises, it could lead to \nrejection of all project activities until community confidence revives. The threat will be highest at \nthe early stages of implementation, but experience in other conservative areas of Pakistan, like \nDir district, demonstrates that a patient and considered approach does result in increased \neconomic activity by women.  \n \n2.  Gender inequality and discrimination is a common experience of women in FATA, as is \ntrue for other areas of Pakistan. Gender-related indicators show that the social, legal, and \npolitical status of women is lower than in the rest of the country. As compared with the 31% \nfemale literacy rate in Pakistan, the rate in FATA is only 3%. In many places it is 0%. According \nto the second phase of the midterm review of performance indicators for the Social Action \nProgramme, 1991\u20131999, the gross mid level enrolment rate in FATA is only 15 % and for girls it \nis only 2%. The same report states that girls make up only 5% of total middle school enrolments \nin FATA. Only 5% of pregnant women had a prenatal consultation, and qualified staff attended \n8% of births. The utilization rate of basic health units and mother and child health centers, and \nuse of contraceptives remain minimal. As compared with 77% of the population in Pakistan with \naccess to clean water, in FATA only 16% have such access.  \n \n3.  The Government strategy to improve the status of women in FATA is to invest primarily \nin education and health. In the 2004\u20132005 Annual Development Plan for FATA, the Government \nhas considerably increased investment in these sectors and taken special measures to improve \nworking  conditions  of  women  staff  in  the  health  and  education  sectors.  In  line  with  the \nGovernment focus, the Project includes considerable investment in the drinking water sector \nand  proactive  gender-specific  measures  to  align  resource  allocation  and  institutional \narrangements in green sectors as well. To ensure women\u2019s access to services provided under \nthe  Project,  gender  mainstreaming  will  be  the  key  strategy  to  integrate  gender  equality \nperspectives into all project components, implementation arrangements, consulting services, \nand the loan agreement.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan:  \nFarming is the predominant source of livelihood in the country as more than 70% of rural households are engaged in \nthis profession. Overall, about 50% of the national labor force is employed in agriculture and its related fields. In the \nfederally administered tribal areas (FATA), about 95% of the farms are less than 5 hectares (12 acres), encompassing \nabout 57% of the area. Farmers operating 1 hectare or less (2.5 acres) make up about 57% of all farms and own \nabout 34% of the farm area. The average farm size is about 0.9 hectare. About 99, 95, and 56% of the farm area is \ncultivated in Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand agencies, respectively. The cultivated area in Khyber Agency is low, \nmainly due to rain-fed conditions as only 4.2% of the farm area is irrigated. About 20% of the farm area is irrigated in \nBajaur Agency, the highest in the project area. The small landholdings inhibit farmers from investing in modern \ntechniques, hence, the productivity levels are low and a great potential exists for increasing farm incomes in the \nproject area. The natural resource base of Bajaur and Mohmand agencies is not only large but also diverse, creating \nopportunities for residents to generate high incomes from regular cash crops and off-season vegetables. On the other \nhand,  Khyber  Agency  is  predominately  rain-fed,  therefore,  residents  rely  more  on  business  and  employment. \nFurthermore the agency is close to Peshawar, the urban center and capital of North-West Frontier Province, and \npeople have more opportunities in employment and business. The bulk of the goods traded under the Afghan Transit \nTrade Agreement, means goods for Afghanistan are smuggled back to Peshawar and the rest of the country through \nKhyber Agency, creating employment opportunities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                 Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe official Pakistan poverty threshold level is PRs774a per capita. Rural poverty is estimated as 38.7%, which is \nconsiderably high than urban areas (22.4%). The decrease in poverty for 2003 resulted from macroeconomic stability \nand a near elimination of external account vulnerability resulting in a growth rate of 5.1% in 2003 as compared with \n3.4% in 2002 and 2.2% in 2001.  \n \nThe project agencies of Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand are the poorest in the FATA. A detailed socioeconomic study \nof the project area (Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand agencies) was carried out during the project preparatory technical \nassistance to understand the realities and provide a basis for plans and designs for the Project. The socioeconomic \nand poverty assessment is based on (i) review of secondary data, (ii) household surveys, (iii) participatory poverty \nassessment, and (iv) needs assessment. Secondary information is available on demography, health, educational, and \nphysical infrastructure facilities; farm and cultivated area; and farm size and ownership distribution. Household surveys \nwere designed to collect household-specific information, such as (i) composition of the farm family; (ii) land ownership \nand tenure; cropping pattern; and yields of major crops, fruits, and vegetables; (iii) cultural practices and input use and \ntheir prices; (iv) enterprise budgets for crops and livestock; (v) access to services like agricultural extension, health, \neducational facilities, and credit; (vi) off-farm income; (vii) household expenditure pattern; (viii) perceptions regarding \nthe constraints and opportunities in increasing crop and livestock productivity; (ix) type and nature of sanitation \nconditions; and (x) economic activities by women. In each household both male and female respondents from each \nfamily were interviewed. \n \nAbout 60% of FATA's population is poor, with levels of over 80% in some villages, based on household income, self- \nassessments, observation of degraded natural resources, access and use rights, availability and access to services, \nand basic infrastructure. This estimate almost certainly understates real poverty in the more isolated communities. \nUsing information from participatory self-evaluations, even the better-off members in communities are barely above \nthe Government's poverty threshold. The region has an aggregate literacy rate of just over 17%\u2014only 3% for \nfemales\u2014with an estimated primary school participation rate of 41%, well below the national averages of 45% literacy \nand 77% participation. A mere 54% of the population has access to clean drinking water, as compared with 75% for \nthe settled districts of neighboring North-West Frontier Province. \n \nFactors underlying poverty in FATA include (i) historical political and social isolation; (ii) a legal system reliant on \n ", "52  Appendix 15 \nexecutive and judicial authority administered through civil servants preferring to maintain the status quo; (iii) poor \nquality and coverage of institutions responsible for the provision of basic services such as health, education, \ncommunications, and productive enterprises; (iv) social practices that preclude participation in economic life by \nwomen; and (v) lack of effective institutions for skill training to enable the labor force to shift from low productivity to \nhigh productivity sectors. Agricultural skills are poor with low productivity; natural resource management is inadequate \nwith increasingly degraded lands. Few alternative employment opportunities are available outside of agriculture. \nAttitudes within the tribal areas coincide with increasing government support for greater participatory involvement by \nthe poor. Radical changes in representative government may occur within the next few years, which provide expanded \nopportunity for the poor to seek improved livelihoods through participation in community planning, greater engagement \nwith government service providers, training, and credit use. Currently, contact between government service providers \nand communities are inadequate, and constrained by lack of resources and relevant programs. \n \nFor most people, the environment is harsh, with few resources not already allocated. Economic growth and economic \nopportunities are few. Water scarcity is an overarching constraint. A large number of people face great hardship in \ncollecting water from remote areas. Some communities are using donkey carts and tractor tankers for bringing water \nfrom remote sources. In other cases, women and children are responsible for collection of water from springs, \ncommunal taps, or dug well usually located at a distance from the community. Scattered evidence from some parts of \nthe agencies suggests that rural households spend between $0.5 (PRs30) to $1.5 (PRs100) on a daily basis to ensure \nwater supplies for domestic consumption. Likewise, in the irrigation subsector, the scarcity of both ground and surface \nwater combined with power shortages remain the biggest constraint to development of irrigation. Low awareness \nabout rainwater harvesting and its limited promotion by the technical line agencies is another factor, which has \nprevented a meaningful utilization of the single biggest source of water in the project areas. \n \nLarge areas in the three tribal agencies are still inaccessible and in desperate need of road links to recently \nconstructed arterial roads, and to open up the economic potential and improve access to social services. The long \nyears  of  neglect  and  financial  stringency  have  caused  deterioration  of  the  existing  road  network  with  direct \nconsequences for the local economy and service provision. There is clearly an urgent need to focus on the \nconstruction of new roads and tracks in selected areas as well as the upgrading of priority existing roads in all three \nagencies. \n \nTo address this situation, the Project seeks to (i) improve the living conditions of the rural poor, especially women; (ii) \nboost agricultural production and incomes of the population living in poverty; (iii) improve the status of women by \ntargeting them for special attention in a culturally acceptable manner, and provide training and support to income-\ngenerating activities; (iv) improve the resource base by rehabilitating and extending irrigated areas and social forestry; \n(v) open the inaccessible areas, and improve access and marketing of the rural communities through improvement \nand construction of main and feeder roads; and (vi) establish and strengthen community organizations as the \ninstitutions through which technical and social services can be provided to target groups on a sustainable basis. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes     No \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen are the most disadvantaged group in FATA, with few economic resources and low social status. Female \nliteracy is a 3%; overall, male literacy is scarcely above 17%, well below the norm for Pakistan. Women\u2019s mobility and \nparticipation in mainstream development activities is traditionally restricted by the dominant patriarchal tribal system. \nThe  Project  has  prepared  a  gender  action  plan  for  enabling  them  to  participate  in  the  Project\u2019s  mainstream \ndevelopment activities. The process must be guided by social traditions; over time, women are expected to improve \ntheir social, economic, and political standing in society.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Operation and maintenance (O&M) of Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed and \nother aid-financed projects has always been a concern for ADB because of the shortage of \ngovernment funds and/or the inability or unwillingness of beneficiaries to pay for such activities. \n \n2.  Under the Project, beneficiaries will pay for O&M on an increasing percentage basis of \nsubprojects turned over to them at the completion of construction\u2014starting at 0% in year 1 and \nescalating  to  100%  in  year  5.  The  program  only  covers  those  subprojects  that  are  the \nresponsibility of the direct beneficiaries; such as drinking water tubewells or shallow dug wells, \nsmall irrigation schemes and ponds, and other such subprojects. \n \n3.  The Government will be responsible for O&M of subprojects under their control; such as \nroads, storage dams, or other larger subprojects that are too large to be managed by the \nbeneficiaries. \n \n4.  ADB proposes to assist in financing O&M for the turned over subprojects based on the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  During development of the design and cost estimates of each subproject, a \ndetailed annual estimate will be made of the operation (such as for the purchase \nof diesel fuel) and maintenance costs (such as repairs of pumps, gates, etc.). \nOther minor costs such as desiltation of canals, repair of bunds, etc. will remain \nthe responsibility of the beneficiaries without pay. A revised cost estimate will be \nmade for each subproject on an annual basis based on lessons learned the \nprevious year.  \n \n(ii)  The beneficiaries and executing agencies line departments at the agency level \nwill establish a jointly operated savings account in the names of responsible \nparties from the village organization and executing agency concerned. The three \nagencies gave assurance that this could be done. On an annual basis, funds will \nbe directly deposited into the joint savings account through the Project\u2019s imprest \naccount and from the beneficiaries based on Table A16. Operating procedures \nwill be established by the project management unit during implementation by the \ntwo  parties  and  adjusted  as  required  during  implementation.  The  project \nimplementation  unit  will  maintain  accounting  and  transparent  records  for  all \nwithdrawals from the account and receipts of purchases/repairs that are made for \nthe facility. \n \n(iii)  The percentage of financing would be based on the schedule in Table A16. \n \nTable A16: Percentage of Financing \n \n% of Financing \nYear Following Completion of Construction \nADB  Beneficiaries \nYear 1  100  0 \nYear 2  75  25 \nYear 3  50  50 \nYear 4  25  75 \nYear 5  0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060427143705+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060404121645+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loan Islamic Republic of Pakistan: Federally Administered Tribal Areas Rural Development Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Author": ""}}
