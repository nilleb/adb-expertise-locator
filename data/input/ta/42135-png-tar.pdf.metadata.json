Regional cooperation and integration is one of the five core operational areas in the \nlong-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)1 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). Papua New Guinea (PNG) shares the world\u2019s second largest island with Indonesia and \nhas potential to benefit from Asia\u2019s rapidly growing economies. The Pacific regional operations \nbusiness plan for 2007\u20132010 identified improving trade links between PNG and Indonesia as \nanother avenue for contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction in PNG.2 Two ADB \nmissions discussed ADB\u2019s scope of assistance with the national and provincial governments, \nand it was agreed that ADB\u2019s initial assistance will focus on developing the border facilities and \nan institutional framework conducive to cross-border trade and investment for the town of \nVanimo, West Sepik Province.   \n \n2.  A project preparatory technical assistance (TA) fact-finding mission visited PNG from \n19 to 29 May 2008. Based on discussions with central and local government agencies, private \nsector and landowner representatives, and donor agencies, the mission defined the TA project\u2019s \nrationale, scope of study, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing plan, and \nterms of reference for the consulting services.3 The TA will prepare the proposed Pilot Border \nTrade  and  Investment  Development  Project.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  With political and macroeconomic stability, and aided by high global commodity prices, \nPNG has maintained positive real gross domestic product (GDP) growth since 2003 and was \nexpected to achieve a rate exceeding 6% in 2007. Both fiscal and external positions have \nstrengthened. The budget surplus was equivalent to 1.7% of GDP in 2007, and official reserves \nincreased to $2 billion (equivalent to 5 months of imports). Inflation was low and the public debt\u2013\nGDP ratio was further reduced to 35%. The improved political and economic environment has \nspurred renewed interest in business opportunities in PNG. Private investment is on the rise, \nand large projects are under way or being contemplated. \n \n4.  In  spite  of  commendable  progress,  there  is  no  optimism  that  the  good  economic \nperformance will be long-lived. Moreover, benefits of the growth are insufficiently trickling down \nto the majority of the population. This is because, firstly, the growth is achieved through high \ncommodity  prices  rather  than  increased  production  and  export  volumes.  Secondly,  the \neconomic  structure  remains  narrowly  based  and  highly  dualistic,  with  the  modern  sector \ndominated  by  mining  and  impacting  upon  just  some  15%  of  the  population.  The  majority \nremains in isolated rural areas, survives on subsistence agriculture, and has poor access to \neconomic  opportunities  and  social  services.  Thirdly,  according  to  an  assessment  of  the \nInternational Finance Corporation, the business environment in PNG is regressive in terms of \nstarting a business, dealing with licenses, employing workers, obtaining credit, and protecting \ninvestors. \n \n5.  International experience shows that trade and investment promote economic growth, \ncreate  job  opportunities,  and  develop  human  capital.  Foreign  trade  and  investment  will \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

More importantly, these will bring with them \nemployment, technical and engineering skills, management know-how, technology, a business \nculture, and markets. PNG enjoys proximity to Australia and Asia\u2019s dynamically developing \neconomies. It has fertile land and rich resources with great potential. Lacking are management \nand  organization,  entrepreneurship,  and  a  conducive  business  environment  that  includes \nefficient and effective policy and administrative practices, infrastructure, law and order, and a \nskilled but low-cost labor force.  \n \n6.  Acknowledging the benefits of foreign trade and investment, the Government introduced \nfree trade zone legislation as early as 2000. Little progress has been made to date along this \nline, however, and the concept remains new to PNG. Although international experience is \nabundant, a trial and error process is warranted to determine what can make the idea work in \nthe PNG context.  \n \n7.  Vanimo, the capital of West Sepik Province, provides an ideal setting for piloting the \nconcept of a free trade zone. The Province borders Papua Province of Indonesia, and Vanimo is \nwell-connected by road with Jayapura, the capital of Papua Province. Papua is Indonesia\u2019s \nsecond richest province. It offers lower prices on such daily necessities as rice, sugar, cooking \noil, and electric appliances. An increasing number of PNG citizens are crossing the border and \nshopping for both consumption and resale.  \n \n8.  Official opening of the border at Vanimo was planned for 2007. This did not proceed, \nhowever, because PNG was not ready with its border facilities and operational systems. On the \nIndonesian side, good roads, modern customs facilities, business show rooms, and roofed \nmarkets have been constructed and staffed. On PNG\u2019s side, however, only an office building \nand some residential houses are constructed, and there are no signs that they are operational.  \n \n9.  Assisting in border facility development and official opening of the border post in Vanimo \nwill help promote cross-border trade between PNG and Papua and improve people\u2019s welfare in \nWest  Sepik  Province.  Investment  opportunities  also  exist.  There  is  a  clear  demand  on \nIndonesia\u2019s side for PNG\u2019s products such as beef, chicken, cocoa, and snack foods, but their \nsupply is constrained by the production capacity and by policy restrictions. \n \n10.  West  Sepik  Province  provides  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  enhance  the  poverty \ninterventions in PNG. The province has a population of about 185,000, most of which is isolated \nin rugged mountains with no road access. Government revenues are small and can scarcely \nmeet 50% of the costs of the service delivery. Consequently, the province is one of the least \ndeveloped in PNG. Life expectancy at birth (45.5 years) is significantly shorter than the national \naverage (57.4 years). The infant mortality rate is 110 per 1,000 live births, well above the \nnational  figure  of  70  per  1,000  live  births.  The  malnutrition  rate  is  around  40%.  Primary \neducation  is  mainly  provided  by  churches.  An  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n11.  Constructing roads and extending services to pockets of population across the third \nlargest province would be costly and unaffordable. An alternative is to build growth centers, \nattracting people down from the mountains. Vanimo has natural advantages to become one of \nthe growth centers. Another advantage is that the national and provincial governments and \nSandaun Free Trade Development Limited signed an agreement on 17 April 2008 to develop \nthe infrastructure in Vanimo\u2014including a power plant, port, and water and sewage facilities\u2014to \nlaunch the free trade zone project. In addition, law and order are better in West Sepik Province. \n \n ", "  3\n12.  Obviously, promoting trade and investment requires more than infrastructure. The policy \nenvironment to support a win\u2013win situation is equally important and difficult to develop. External \nassistance will definitely be needed.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project preparatory TA aims to increase trade and investment between PNG and \nIndonesia by improving the physical and institutional environment in West Sepik Province. The \noutcome will be a project design, which will be agreed between the Government and ADB.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The  TA  focuses  on  two  distinctive  outputs:  (i)  a  design  for  a  pilot  border  facility \ndevelopment project, and (ii) an advisory TA program aiming at creating an enabling institutional \nenvironment for trade and investment between PNG and Indonesia (without excluding others). \nActivities include (i) identifying the border facilities to be financed; (ii) designing specifications; \n(iii) preparing a procurement plan, bidding documents, and implementation schedule; (iv) cost \nestimation; (v) designing construction supervision arrangements; (vi) assessing PNG\u2019s laws and \nregulations governing border management and control, trade, and investment; (vii) assessing \nIndonesia\u2019s laws and regulations governing border management in Papua Province, trade, and \ninvestment; (viii) reviewing and assessing the existing border agreements between the two \ncountries; (ix) designing institutional development road maps for efficient and effective PNG \nborder  management  and  a  conducive  trade  and  investment  environment  in  Vanimo;  (x) \nsocioeconomic studies for the town of Vanimo, Wutung Village, and other major stakeholders; \n(xi) collecting baseline data; (xii) assessing socioeconomic and environmental implications of \nthe proposed project; and (xiii) preparing mitigation programs.  \n \n15.  The first output will be achieved through an association between an international and a \nnational building design and construction firm from PNG. The national firm will do the actual \ndesign for the border facilities, as it knows PNG culture, standards, and approval process. The \ninternational  firm  will  supervise  and  manage  the  national  firm  and  be  responsible  for  the \ndesign\u2019s quality.   \n \n16.  The  second  output  will  be  achieved  through  an  association  between  the  same \ninternational firm and another team of national consultants from PNG and Indonesia who are \neither individuals or from a firm. Effective interaction between the consultants and Government \nwill contribute greatly to the output\u2019s quality. It will be commendable if the Government provides \nthe leadership and policy directions and drives the process.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n17.  The TA is estimated at $990,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to \nprovide $900,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance $90,000 (in kind) by \nproviding counterpart staff, office accommodation and support services, local communication \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nand transport, and other services and facilities required for implementing the TA. The detailed \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \ncost estimates and financing plan are attached as Appendix 3. The Government has been \nadvised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n ", "4  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  West Sepik Provincial Administration (WSPA) will be the Executing Agency for the TA. \nWSPA will establish a steering committee and a core project team. It will provide an adequately \nfurnished office in Vanimo as part of the counterpart fund contribution. The steering committee \nwill  comprise  the  provincial  administrator;  representatives  from  provincial  offices  of  foreign \naffairs, provincial and local affairs; immigration; customs; quarantine; trade and investment; and \nWutung Village; and representatives from the central government, including the Department of \nNational Planning and Monitoring; Department of Treasury; Department of Commerce and \nIndustry; Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Immigration; and Department of Provincial \nand Local Level Government Affairs. The project team will include a project director, a trade and \ninvestment officer, a provincial planner, a district project officer, a district land officer, and a \ntechnical advisor. The project director will report to the chair of the steering committee. The \nsteering committee will be responsible to provide leadership and policy directions, while the \nproject team will work as secretariat for the steering committee and counterpart staff for the \nADB project responsible for coordinating and liaising with the steering committee, central and \nprovincial government agencies, Papua Province of Indonesia, the joint border committee, and \nADB. \n \n19.  The TA will require 37 person-months of international and national consulting services \nto carry out the scope of the study as defined in the outline terms of reference in Appendix 4. \nThe areas of expertise required include trade and investment policy formulation, building design \nand construction, border management, and socioeconomics.   \n \n20.  The TA will be carried out by an international consulting firm in association with a \nnational building design and construction firm from PNG for output 1. For output 2, the same \ninternational  consulting  firm  shall  propose  a  team  of  national  consultants  from  PNG  and \nIndonesia where required to carry out the national inputs under output 2. The international \nconsulting firm will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time), using simplified technical proposal procedures based on \nquality- and cost-based selection with a quality and cost weighting of 90:10.  \n \n21.  The TA will require purchase of a vehicle and office equipment to support the operation \nof the project management office. The purchase of a vehicle is justified for security reasons. \nAnother justification is that ADB is a long-term development partner of PNG and will be present \nin  West  Sepik  Province  for  a  long  time.  Building  and  maintaining  a  functional  project \nmanagement office will be in the interest of the project and of other regional initiatives.   \n \n22.  Purchase of the vehicle will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The vehicle will be transferred to WSPA upon completion of the TA. WSPA \nwill maintain the vehicle properly and use it for follow-up ADB projects.  \n \n23.  The international consulting firm will provide ADB and WSPA with 10 copies of the \ninception, interim, draft final, and final reports (three copies for ADB and seven for WSPA). \nElectronic versions are required. WSPA will distribute the reports to the relevant government \nagencies, the steering committee, the joint border committee, and Papua Province of Indonesia. \n \n24.  The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period. It will commence in January 2009 \nand end in December 2009.  \n \n ", "  5\nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n25.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nWest Sepik Province is a remote province in Papua New Guinea (PNG) bordering Papua Province of Indonesia. It has a land \narea of about 3.6 million hectares, a population of about 185,000, and a coastline of 260 kilometers. In terms of land size, it is \nPNG\u2019s third largest province, while in terms of population it is the sixth smallest. Most of the population lives in isolated \nmountainous areas without road connections and is supported by subsistence agriculture. The modern sector is dominated by \nthe timber industry, which provides a major source of revenue for the province. \n \nIn terms of human development indicators, West Sepik Province is one of the least developed provinces in PNG. Life \nexpectancy at birth (45.5 years) is significantly shorter than the national average (57.4 years). The infant mortality rate is 110 \nper 1,000 live births, well above the national figure of 70 per 1,000 live births. The malnutrition rate is around 40%. Primary \neducation is mainly provided by churches, which operate 66% of the schools.  \n \nConstructing roads and extending services across the province would be costly and unaffordable. An alternative is to develop \ngrowth centers, creating opportunities to attract people down from the mountains. Vanimo, the capital of West Sepik Province, \nhas advantages to become a growth center. It borders the second richest province in Indonesia and has been declared a free \ntrade zone. Both Indonesian and national firms are exploring business opportunities. Law and order is stronger here than in \nother parts of PNG.  \n \nThe Pacific regional operations business plan for 2007\u20132010 identified improving trade links between PNG and Indonesia as \nanother avenue for contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction in PNG. The project is prioritized and agreed upon \nwith the central and provincial governments. It will support the Government\u2019s strategy to promote growth centers and improve \ndevelopment prospects in West Sepik Province. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H)    Geographic (TI-G)    Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe project does not target the poor directly. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nOpportunities will be limited, as the project aims to improve the business environment for investors.  \n \n ", "Appendix 2  9 \n \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nThe primary beneficiaries of the project will be PNG national and provincial governments, the business sector, people in West \nSepik Province, and the PNG economy. PNG is a society with numerous clans. Villagers are poor, but they are not vulnerable \nand socially excluded. They will benefit from employment arising from increased investment in terms of cash income and skills \ndevelopment.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThey  need  economic  growth,  investment,  job  opportunities,  institutional  development,  skills  development,  and \nentrepreneurship. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nLack of skills and discipline will reduce chances of employment. The project leaves it to the market to drive skills development.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nNational and provincial governments and Wutung villagers. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations [NGOs] and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nIndividual interviews, group discussions, workshops, discussions with NGOs, and village-based discussions. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making          Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nConsultation and participation is a good practice and source of information, but it does not necessarily require a written plan to \nbe accomplished. The fluid and unpredictable environment in PNG renders any prefabricated plan useless.  \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \nThere are no unique gender issues relevant to the project. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making?     \n  Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nPhysical and institutional development conducive to trade and investment are prioritized by the national and provincial \ngovernment and are already huge tasks to accomplish, given the capacity on the ground.   \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality?        \n  Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nGender equity will be covenanted and implemented through civil works contracts.  \n \n ", " 10  Appendix 2   \n \nIII.
