The partnership between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Azerbaijan, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Mongolia, and countries in Central Asia (the Region) to promote regional \ncooperation has entered into a new phase with the establishment of a formal overall institutional \nframework (OIF)  in 2002. The purpose of the OIF was to strengthen the overall planning, \nimplementation, and coordination of regional economic cooperation initiative supported by ADB, \nas  it  was  developing  into  a  full-fledged  program  (the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation program\u2014CAREC).1 The first ministerial conference under the OIF was held in \nMarch 2002.  The conference endorsed ADB\u2019s regional cooperation program, and requested \nADB to  marshal  resources  and  expertise  for  regional  cooperation  activities.  In  May 2003, \nmultilateral institutions\u2014ADB, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IsDB),  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and World Bank\u2014agreed to work together to use the OIF as \na platform for pursuing cooperation in the Region.  A joint working group was established to \nprepare the second  ministerial  conference,  which  was held in November 2003. During the \nconference, the  ministers stressed the need for the OIF to guide the CAREC program. They \nemphasized  the  importance  of  strengthening  the  OIF  and    building  capacity  for  regional \ncooperation at the country level, thereby enhancing countries' ownership and rendering the OIF \nmore effective and sustainable.  In response to this request, ADB proposes a new regional \ntechnical assistance (TA) aimed at  strengthening capacity for regional cooperation under the \nOIF. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Region's geographical isolation, relatively small internal markets, and need to use \nits  natural  resources  in  a  sustainable  manner  render  cooperation  among  the  countries  a \nnecessity for sustained economic growth and alleviating poverty. To achieve cooperation at its \nfull  potential,  the  Region  has  daunting  challenges.  In  particular,  the  Region  needs  to  (i) \nstrengthen understanding  and  mutual  trust, (ii) raise awareness  of the benefits of regional \ncooperation  viz.  the  pursuit  of  self-sufficiency,  (iii)  better  design  and  coordinate  regional \ncooperation efforts and arrangements to account for growing divergence among the countries in \nterms of economic policies and performance, and (iv) strengthen relatively weak institutional \nand management capacities of national governments in terms of regional cooperation.  \n \n3.  The OIF has been established to help address these  challenges, which reflects both \ncountry  ownership  and  a shared  understanding  among  the  participating  countries  to  work \ntogether to achieve stability and prosperity in the Region. Toward these ends, the OIF provides \n(i) a forum that  is strengthening mutual trust and contributing to increased awareness of the \n\"win-win\" outcomes of regional cooperation; and (ii) a  mechanism for policy dialogue, better \nplanning, and implementation of regional cooperation efforts and activities.3  \n                                                 \n1  The  program  has  seven  participants:  Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan, \nUzbekistan, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 July 2003. \n3 The OIF consists of an annual  ministerial conference  that provides overall guidance and  makes policy and \ndirectional  decisions,  and  sector  coordinating  committees  (SCCs)  at  the  operational  level  that  coordinate \nsectorwide issues and implementation. Working groups are set up at the project level, as needed, under the SCCs. \nThe senior officials meeting is designed to coordinate cross-sectoral issues and prepare for the ministerial \nconference. A national focal point appointed in each country serves as a national coordinating mechanism to \nensure effective coordination among concerned governments agencies and other interested parties in matters \nrelated to regional cooperation. ADB provides central secretariat support to the OIF.  \n ", "2 \n4.  Given the challenges regional cooperation is facing, the OIF has proven to be successful \nover the last 2 years since it was established. The ministerial conferences provided leadership \nand strategic guidance to the cooperation process, creating better understanding of regional \npriorities,  and  an  appropriate  agenda  for  cooperation.  The sector coordinating committees \n(SCCs) have been effective in instigating key regional initiatives. The  Customs Cooperation \nCommittee, for example, has met seven times and developed a mutually agreed action program \nfor harmonizing customs procedures and  facilitating trade. Under the auspices of the energy \nSCC, the ADB-supported Regional Power Transmission Modernization Project was prepared to \npromote power trade in the Region. The transport SCC was instrumental in the preparation and \nimplementation of regional projects, such as the  Kyrgyz Transport Corridor Project  and  in \ndeveloping economically viable transport corridors from Central Asia to the warm water ports in \nthe south. In 2002, ADB alone approved $115 million for regional cooperation projects. ADB, \nEBRD, IMF, IsDB, UNDP, and World Bank have together programmed a total of about $1 billion \nfor regional cooperation loans and about $21 million in TA over the 2004\u20132006 period. \n  \n5.  As  the  CAREC  program  develops  into  a  full-fledged  widely  accepted  and  properly \nresourced regional initiative, demands for institutional support for addressing important regional \nissues through the OIF are also increasing.4 This involves in particular increasing requirements \nfor the participating countries in terms of their overall capacity in planning, coordinating, and \nimplementing regional initiative and projects. Lessons learned from ADB's earlier regional TAs \nfocusing on increasing understating and raising awareness of benefits of regional cooperation  \nclearly show that (i) regional cooperation requires a deeper and more sustained commitment \nthan is typically called for in national development programs; (ii)  preparation of inter-country \nprojects and programs  requires a multicountry perspective; (iii) regional cooperation involves a \nprocess of balancing interests among participating countries through consensus building and \nconsensus maintenance; and (iv) thus, the regional cooperation effort always requires a high \nlevel of regular communication within and across participating countries. \n \n6.  Another lesson learned is that for regional cooperation initiatives to succeed they need \nto be properly resourced. In this regard, targeted capacity building programs that enhance the \ncountry\u2019s ability to respond  effectively to opportunities for regional cooperation  have  to  be \nprovided. First, strengthening sector expertise in areas such as assessing the benefits and \ncosts of regional cooperation projects would be instrumental in convincing key decision makers \nin pursuing regional programs more proactively.  Second, regular high-level forums to discuss \nregional cooperation will be important in fostering dialogue and generating trust provided the \nforums are properly prepared.5 Third, a key constraint to regional cooperation has been a lack of \ncapacity  to  identify  and  address  policy  issues  and  integrate  these  into  the  domestic \ndevelopment planning cycle and documents. This is manifested in the absence of a well-crafted \ngovernment strategy on regional cooperation in some countries. A strategy laying out visions, \nobjectives, priorities, steps and measures, and resource implications is necessary for realizing \nnational development aspirations through regional cooperation. Fourth, given that the national \nfocal  points  (NFPs)  are  vital  in  moving  the  regional  cooperation  agenda  within  the \nadministrations, they need to be given targeted and individually tailored training; access to \nspecific expertise to address issues as they emerge;  and  resources  to  convene  meetings, \n                                                 \n4 For example, during the second ministerial conference held in November 2003, the ministers endorsed the \nestablishment of (i) a SCC on trade policy to promote trade in the Region, and (ii) a working group on energy and \nwater resources under the existing energy SCC to address the issue of energy trading and careful water resources \nmanagement. In addition, a multilateral institution coordinating group has been established to facilitate coordination \nin support of regional cooperation. \n5  According to a minister and ex-ADB governor, providing opportunities for high-level contact among the countries is \n\u201cvery much needed and highly appreciated.\u201d ", "    3 \ncoordinate within the government, across governments, and with the private sector, academia \nand nongovernment organizations. Finally, efficient information and knowledge sharing among \ncountries is vital for  regional initiatives to succeed as is learning from experience in regional \ncooperation elsewhere. Improved information and knowledge flows provide a basis for more \ninformed decision making at the political and technical levels, and it contributes to consensus \nand trust building.     \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The purpose of the TA is to strengthen the capacity for regional cooperation under the \nOIF so that participating countries can assume greater roles and responsibilities in planning, \nimplementing, and coordinating the CAREC program. The main outputs envisaged from the TA \nare (i) a capacity-building assessment plan; (ii) enhancement of understanding on regional \ncooperation at  a  higher  level  and  policy-making capacity;  (iii)  set  up  and  functioning  of  a \nregional cooperation support unit within each government; (iv) trained national officials involved \nin regional cooperation; and (v) enhanced information, experience, and knowledge exchange on \nregional cooperation. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Capacity building is a long-term process and requires strong commitments over an \nequally  long  term.  The  TA  is  the  first  such  focused  support  for  this  regional  cooperation \ninitiative. The TA covers seven countries with varied capacities for regional cooperation.  This \nmerits, in particular, (i) a flexible approach, which will necessitate adjustments  and  minor \nchanges in the scope, activities, and arrangements during the 2.5 years of implementation; and \n(ii)  a  two-stage  approach,  which  emphasizes  governments'  endorsement  and  other \nstakeholders'  consultation  at  the  first  stage  to  ensure  country  ownership  and  effective \nimplementation at the second stage.     \n \n9.  Assessing Capacity and Developing a Plan. The TA will develop a comprehensive \ncapacity-building  assessment  plan  to  strengthen  the  OIF.  Focusing  on  institutional \nstrengthening and needs assessment, the plan will consist of (i) identification and analysis of \nconstraints and weaknesses in the government structures for regional cooperation; (ii) detailed \nneeds assessment for capacity-building interventions to address constraints and weaknesses; \nand (iii) recommendations of time-bound steps needed to develop clear mandates, detailed \nterms of reference, adequate staffing, work procedures, and an operating budget. In addition, \nfor training needs, the plan will specify (i) intended participants or beneficiaries, the criteria and \nprocess for their selection with consideration to their continuing involvement in the CAREC \nprogram and regional cooperation; (ii) coordination with other relevant training programs that \nare  supported  by  bilateral  and  multilateral  organizations;  (iii)  topics  and  content  of  training \nprograms; and (iv) identification of resource persons, trainers and/or training institutions in and \nout of the region to conduct the training programs. \n \n10.  Sustaining  High-Level  Commitment.   The  TA  will  support  a  high-level  forum  on \nregional cooperation. The forum will provide an opportunity for decision-makers to exchange \nviews and discuss regional cooperation in general and important policy issues in particular. \nSpecific  policy  issues  and/or  topics  as  themes  of  the  forum  will  be  agreed  upon  by  the \ngovernments.  This  will  contribute  to  promoting  understanding  and  trust,  and  strengthening \npolitical will. In addition, the TA will assist the governments on a pilot basis to strengthen policy-", "4 \nmaking capacity by improving and developing their strategies on regional cooperation and \nrelated policy issues. For this purpose, the TA will provide, as needed, consulting and advisory \nservices.    \n \n11.  Institutionalizing Regional Cooperation. To strengthen the NFPs as an institution, a \nregional cooperation support unit will be established under the NFP in each country. For this \npurpose,  the  TA  will  provide  advisory  services  and  equipment,  if  necessary,  for  the  initial \noperations of the unit. The advisory services may involve placing a local regional cooperation \nspecialist in the unit in each country. The specialist will help implement the plan and develop \ninformation channeling within and across the countries, and provide support for preparing \nreports and organizing meetings. Over the long term, the regional cooperation support unit is \nexpected to evolve as a national CAREC secretariat within the government structure to ensure \neffective participation in the regional cooperation initiative and its long-term sustainability.    \n \n12.  Building Capacity. The TA will provide targeted training for officials involved in regional \ncooperation, including line ministries and other relevant government agencies (especially NFPs \nand SCCs). Based on the needs assessment, the TA will develop more structured topic-oriented \ntraining modules and programs. Training areas will include, but not limited to, (i) planning, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  of  regional  program  and  projects;  (ii)  impact  evaluation  of \nsubregional projects; and (iii) case studies of successful regional cooperation initiatives and \nprojects. At least two training courses (with about 10 people per country) will be provided in \nregional training institutes or universities to be identified, in cooperation with other development \npartners.  To  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  training,  the  participants  may  be  tasked  to \nformulate a few regional projects for consideration by ADB and governments. Depending on \nrecommendations in the plan, other sector-specific training will be provided, as necessary.    \n \n13.  Sharing and  Creating Knowledge. The TA will support activities aimed to facilitate \nexchange of information, experience, and knowledge on regional cooperation. These activities \ninclude (i) semi-annual NFP meetings; (ii) regular meetings of SCCs; (iii) in-country roundtable \nmeetings to be attended by government officials, nongovernment organizations, the business \ncommunity, and academia to raise awareness of and exchange views on regional cooperation; \nand (iv)  creation  and  maintenance  of  a  regional  web  site  as  a  focal  point  for  information \nexchange.6  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million equivalent. ADB will finance $950,000 equivalent \non a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The participating governments will provide \nremaining $50,000 equivalent, equal to the imputed value of staff time and use of government \nfacilities  conducting  activities  under  the  TA.  The  TA  will  mainly  support  the  provision  of \nconsulting  services  and  expertise,  training  at  the  regional  level,  and  in-country roundtable \nmeetings. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented during 30 months, from February 2004 to July 2006, and in \na phased manner. For the first stage, from February 2004 to  August 2004, the TA will be \ndevoted  to  developing  a  capacity-building  assessment  plan,  which  will  be  reported  to  and \n                                                 \n6 Given the evolving nature of capacity building interventions in regional cooperation, the activities under this \ncomponent need to be flexible to accommodate the requirements that emerge. ", "    5 \nguided by the senior officials meeting and the ministerial conference under the OIF to ensure \ncountry  ownership.  Subject  to  the  endorsement  and  commitments  from  the  participating \ngovernments, the TA will move to the next stage (September 2004\u2013July 2006).    \n \n16.  The TA will cover seven participating countries of the CAREC program. 7 The Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation Unit (CARECU), East and Central Asia Department of \nADB, will be the Executing Agency for the TA under the general supervision of the director of \nthe Operations Coordinating Division, East and Central Asia Department. The office of the NFP \nin each country will serve as the counterpart agency for coordinating TA implementation.     \n \n17.  The services of individual international consultants (5 person-months) and individual \ndomestic consultants (89 person-months) will be engaged. The consultants will provide advisory \nand technical services as specified in their terms of reference. Outline terms of reference of \nconsultants are presented in Appendix 3. International and domestic consultants will be selected \nin accordance with the  ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. Given the importance of fulfilling \nthe TA objective, local regional cooperation specialists will be engaged on a quarterly basis in \nclose collaboration with the governments, ADB resident missions and CARECU with the help of \nthe international consultants. Their evaluation of the specialists\u2019 performance will be the basis of \nfurther  engagement.  Office  equipment  for  this  TA  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  will  be  transferred  to  counterpart \nagencies upon completion of the TA.  \n     \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under  the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis for \nCapacity Building for Regional Cooperation in Central Asia, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  Azerbaijan, PRC, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
