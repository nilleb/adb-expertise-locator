The Asian Development Bank (ADB) fielded a fact-finding mission in November 2002 to \nformulate an advisory technical assistance (TA)1 to improve the nutritional status of poor and \nvulnerable populations especially in urban areas. The mission2 met with representatives of \nGovernment,  development  partners,  and  research  institutions.  The  mission  agreed  with \nGovernment  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia's health and nutrition trends improved steadily from 1989 until 1999. The \nprevalence of protein-energy malnutrition among pre-school children decreased from 37.5% in \n1989 to 8.1% in 19993. This trend was reversed by the economic crisis,4 which reduced real \nincomes and left large segments of the population, particularly in urban areas, unable to afford \nadequate  food  and  nutrition.  The  large  number  of  malnourished  populations  during  the \neconomic crisis was largely caused by food insecurity at the household level, especially among \nthe poor.  Between 1996 and 1999 the number of people below the poverty line in urban areas \nincreased from 18.0 million to 32.2 million.5 Rates of acute malnutrition among children under 5 \nyears of age were as high as 5% in rural Java and almost 13% in Jakarta.6 According to Helen \nKeller International, rates of maternal and childhood anaemia are higher in urban slums than in \nrural Java. Maternal anaemia due to iron deficiency is associated with low birth weight and is \nlargely responsible for a fourth of maternal mortality, a persisting problem in Indonesia.  \n \n3.  There  are  several  factors  influencing  nutrition  trends  in  Indonesia.  Urbanization  in \nIndonesia increased from 22% in 1980 to 39% in 2000. The urban poor depend on income and \nlow wages in insecure jobs. Slow economic recovery, high unemployment, and increasing costs \nfor food and other essentials continue to undermine food and nutrition security for the urban \npoor. In the poorest Javanese urban areas, the poor spend more than 75% of their income on \nfood. Potentially harmful changes in diets such as consumption of processed and prepared food \nalso accompany urbanization. The rice-based diet of the urban poor is energy-deficient, is \nunbalanced, and lacks essential micronutrients. Vulnerable populations such as slum dwellers, \ninternally displaced persons, and street children are more likely to be affected by health risks, \nlife-cycle risks (birth, maternity, and death), and social and environmental risks. Many of them \nare  not  covered  by  formal  safety  nets.  Lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  two  social  sector \ndevelopment program loans7 show that the growing urban population is particularly at risk of \nmalnutrition and diet-related diseases, and that existing public health and nutrition programs do \nnot meet urban nutrition needs. \n \n                                                                 \n1\n  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 February 2002. \n2  The mission comprised Barbara Lochmann (Mission Leader, Social Protection Specialist) and James Sonnemann \n(Nutrition Specialist, Staff Consultant). \n3  SUSENAS 1999.

Increasing urbanization and nutrition transition to higher-fat diets, predisposing people to \nchronic noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later life, \ndemands a reorientation of nutrition programs in terms of service delivery structure and for \ncurative, preventive, and promotive approaches. In Indonesia, adult obesity is twice as prevalent \nin urban areas as in rural areas. A unique issue emerging from this nutrition transition is the \ndouble burden of undernutrition and obesity in the same  household; 9.8% of all households \nhave both underweight and overweight members in the same household.  \n \n5.  Given Indonesia\u2019s rapid social and economic changes, the implementation of nutrition \nprograms in urban areas is lagging. While growth monitoring and promotion is still a cornerstone \nof Indonesian nutrition programs delivered by integrated health posts (posyandu),8 the growth of \nchildren under the age of 3 years is not fully monitored. Posyandu service delivery strategies \nare  based  on  the  rural nutrition situation. An appropriate service delivery strategy will be \nrequired to respond to the urban nutrition situation. \n \n6.  Central  government  is  responsible  for  overall  nutrition  policy  development.  With \ndecentralization, local authorities and parliaments are directly responsible for identifying local \nneeds, mobilizing resources, and providing public services. Minimum service standards and \nobligatory functions, including nutrition-related health service interventions, have been defined.9 \nHealthy  Indonesia  201010 sets out the National Health Development Program intended to \nachieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The National Plan of Action \nfor  Food  and  Nutrition  (NPAFN)11  emphasizes  the  need  to  adapt  interventions  to  local \nconditions.  These  targets  are  not  likely  to  be  reached  without  a  reorientation  of  polices, \nstrategies, and partnerships addressing in particular urban nutrition issues. \n \n7.  ADB has taken the lead in improving nutrition in Asia and the Pacific through extensive \nwork in the public and private sector. In Indonesia, ADB supported urban nutrition through two \nsector  development  program  loans,  food  fortification,  and  three  nutrition-related  technical \nassistance12 that emphasized the economic costs and benefits of malnutrition.  ADB's Family \nHealth and Nutrition Project13 promotes awareness about healthy diets for the rural poor and \nstrengthens related household-level decisions and behaviour. Several funding agencies provide \nassistance to the nutrition sector in Indonesia. Building on ADB\u2019s nutrition sector work14 the \nWorld Bank provides TA for food fortification and micronutrient policy development. The United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) supports the Government in improving maternal and child \nhealth services, including growth monitoring at posyandu and food supplementation. The World \nFood Program (WFP) complements the Government\u2019s subsidized rice sale program. The United \n                                                                 \n8\n  Posyandu services are provided through a Government program for improving family nutrition called Usaha \nPerbaikan Gizi Keluarga (UPGK). \n9\n  Minimum service standards include, among others, visits for pregnant women and infants, growth monitoring of \nunder  five  years  of  age,  supplementary  food  for  elementary  school  children  in  poor  areas,  vitamin  A \nsupplementation for children under five years of age. \n10  Healthy Indonesia 2010 is the National Health Development Plan. \n11  The NPAFN is the main guideline for policy makers in designing coordinative plan for food and nutrition programs \nat the central, provincial and district levels. \n12  ADB. 1996.

There  is  yet  no  systematic  approach  for  addressing  nutrition  transition,  food,  and \nnutrition security especially among urban poor and vulnerable populations in an integrated \nmanner. A key challenge in decentralizing nutrition programs is to ensure that nutrition receives \nappropriate consideration in district planning and resource allocation. Unless local decision-\nmakers are convinced of the social benefits in funding preventive and promotive nutrition \nprograms, local governments may not invest in such interventions. Social cost-benefit and cost-\neffectiveness analyses of nutrition interventions can guide local decision-makers in determining \npriorities and maximizing limited financial resources for poor urban areas, including high-risk \npopulations. Ensuring equitable and adequate nutrition service delivery for the poor will require \npro-poor budget allocations prioritizing nutrition interventions based on local conditions as well \nas appropriate institutional and community-based arrangements for effective service delivery. \n \n9.  Decentralization provides opportunities for new public-private partnerships to improve \nthe nutrition status of the urban poor. The TA will focus on developing locally appropriate \nnutrition interventions reaching especially poor and vulnerable populations in selected urban \nareas of the Decentralized Health Services (DHS) II Project and the Shelter Project.15 The TA \nwill  especially  draw  on  lessons  learned  from  the  Family  Health  Nutrition  Project  and \ncomplement efforts of DHS I and DHS II.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The project aims to improve and sustain nutritional status of the urban poor. The \npurpose of the TA is to assist the Government to design a model of public-private partnership \noperations  for  improved  nutrition  management  in  urban  areas16  and  to  prepare  a  project \nproposal focusing on improved nutrition management. \n \n11.  The main outputs of the TA will include (i) reviewing lessons learned from nutrition \nprojects and national policy guidelines for urban nutrition and feeding practices based on a life-\ncycle approach17 including recommendations to improve the nutrition status of the poor; (ii) \nassessing the prevalence and incidence of malnutrition particularly of the poor in the selected \nurban areas; (iii) examining nutrition policy and implications of decentralization for community-\nbased programs in urban areas and making recommendations for decentralized urban nutrition \nmanagement; (iv) identifying appropriate options for equitable and cost-effective interventions in \nthe nutrition transition and examining approaches and schemes for targeting subsidies for the \npoor; (v) identifying and estimating costs of core components for enhanced service delivery and \ncommunity-based  nutrition  interventions;  (vi)  identifying  institutional  and  public-private \npartnership options that integrate nutrition improvement as part of their poverty reduction and \nsocial protection programs; (vii) developing a project proposal, including rationale, expected \noutcomes,  benefits,  logical  framework,  geographic  scope,  assessment  of  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, estimates of inputs and costs, and implementation arrangements and \nschedules; (viii) developing a comprehensive nutrition policy plan with specific and sequenced \n                                                                 \n15\n ADB. 2001.

Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The TA will require systematic involvement of stakeholders18 in identifying priority needs \nand local solutions in (tentatively) three urban areas including Greater Jakarta (Tangerang), \nMakassar, and Medan.19 The TA will be carried out in two phases over 6 months. In the first \nphase (2 months), the TA will address activities outlined in para. 11 (i) to (iii).  In the second \nphase (4 months), the TA will address activities outlined in para. 11 (iv) to (xi). Based on the \nresults  and  recommendations  of  phase  1,  two  types  of  decentralized  workshops  will  be \norganized in collaboration with urban authorities and the private sector. Advocacy workshops \nwill aim at generating commitment among key decision-makers, including members of the Local \nPeople\u2019s Representative Assembly for investing in nutrition. Participatory planning workshops \nwill involve stakeholders to define key components of an urban nutrition management model, \nconsidering  (i)  key  interventions  based  on  the  life-cycle  approach focusing especially on \nchildren under 5 years and women of reproductive age, (ii) public-private support structure for \nnutrition interventions, (iii) capacity-building requirements for urban nutrition management, (iv) \nnutrition awareness, and (v) coordination of external funding for urban nutrition management. \n  \n13.  The TA consultant team will consolidate findings and recommendations produced by the \nsituation analysis and planning workshops to develop an operations model for urban nutrition \nmanagement including a project proposal. Based on workshop results, the TA consultant team \nwill (i) analyze project components, as appropriate, for technical, financial, economic, social, \nand institutional viability and sustainability; and (ii) provide policy recommendations on urban \nnutrition for the NPAFN. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising $299,000 in \nforeign exchange and $326,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $201,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding  program.  The  Government  will  provide  $125,000  equivalent  in  the  form  of  office \naccommodation, counterpart and support staff, and other operational costs including local \nground transportation. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Directorate General of Public Health in the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  TA  responsible  for  all  technical  and  administrative  aspects  in \ncollaboration  with  other  departments  and  ministries.  Suitably  qualified  and  experienced \ncounterpart staff will work full time with the TA consultants. To oversee implementation of TA \nactivities, a steering committee, chaired by the Director General of Public Health, will be \nconstituted by the end of the first month and will meet every 2 months. Members will include \n                                                                 \n18  Stakeholders include local government, academic institutions, civil society, and program beneficiaries. \n19\n Target areas have been selected from two projects, DHS II, and the Shelter Project, which are included in the 2003 \nlending program.

A central technical team will be established to work closely with the TA consultant team. \nThe central technical team will include representatives from (i) the Decentralization Unit in MOH; \n(ii) the subdirectorate for Urban Health in the Department of Public Health; (iii) the Directorate \nGeneral of Communicable Disease Control; (iv) the BAPPENAS Directorate of Community \nHealth and Nutrition; (v) the Center for Nutrition Research and Development; (vi) the Ministry of \nEducation; and (vii) the Ministry of Agriculture. At the municipal level, a local advisory team will \nbe established composed of the head of the Department of Health, Regional Planning Board \n(BAPPEDA), nongovernmental organizations, universities, and the private sector to oversee and \ncoordinate planning activities. The local advisory teams will be constituted in time to take part in \nthe TA inception workshop and will provide advice to the consultant team.  \n \n17.  The TA will require 12 person-months of international and 25 person-months of domestic \nconsultants with expertise in health systems development and decentralization, maternal and \nchild nutrition, food policy and nutrition, urban anthropology, community development, health \neconomics, financial analysis and planning, surveillance, budgeting, and workshop facilitation. \nThey will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants based on \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.
