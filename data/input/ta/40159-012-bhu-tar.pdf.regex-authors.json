", " \n \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bhutan requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  conducting  the  Third  Bhutan  Living \nStandards Survey (BLSS), a major source of data for assessing its five-year plan, 2008\u20132013,1 \nassessing poverty, and updating weightings for the consumer price index. The most recent \nBLSS  was  conducted  in  2007  under  the  sponsorship  of  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP), following the first BLSS conducted in 2003 with funding from ADB through \nits TA for Strengthening the National Statistical System.2 The 2003 BLSS provided Bhutan with \nits  first  estimates  of  poverty  in  urban  areas,  rural  areas,  and  nationally.  The  2007  BLSS \nrendered good estimates at the district level and was the source of benchmark values for three \nsets  of  indicators  for  the  2008\u20132013  government  development  plan:  (i)  food  security  for \nvulnerable households in intervention areas, (ii) household income, and (iii) consumption of \nbasic commodities. \n \n2.  The fact-finding mission on 14\u201318 February 2011 consulted with the government and \nmajor stakeholders on the issues pertaining to the BLSS and its impact, outcome, outputs, and \nimplementation arrangements. The mission held extensive discussions with the government \nagencies that are the major users of the BLSS\u2014the National Statistics Bureau (NSB), Gross \nNational Happiness Commission, Ministry of Labour and Human Resources, and Ministry of \nAgriculture and Forests\u2014as well as with the UNDP as the sponsor of the 2007 BLSS and the \nWorld Food Programme, both as users and supporters of the 2007 BLSS. These agencies \ncontributed to TA design. In particular, the Gross National Happiness Commission underscored \nthe need for the third BLSS to provide updated indicators for the government\u2019s 2008\u20132013 plan. \nThe mission also consulted with the ADB team on the ongoing country diagnostic study. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Another BLSS is needed to assess the outputs of the 2008\u20132013 government plan, \nwhich was formulated on the basis of the 2007 BLSS. The BLSS has data on household \ndemographics, household assets and remittances, education, employment, health, commodity \nprices, and consumption expenditures, which are inputs for compiling the national accounts of \nthe  household  sector. It  is  a good source  of data for  policy  research  and  updating  other \neconomic indicators such as the consumer price index. The survey will provide updated poverty \nestimates  at  the  district  level  and  assess  the  effectiveness  of  implemented  policies  and \nprograms designed to improve people\u2019s lives. \n \n                                                \n1  Government  of  Bhutan,  Gross  National  Happiness  Commission.  2009.    Tenth  Five-Year  Plan, 2008\u20132013. \nThimphu. \n2  ADB. 2001.  Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening the National Statistical System. \nManila (TA 3669-BHU). The TA supported the (i) provision of technical advice for drafting the statistics act; (ii) \nimprovement  of  national  accounts;  (iii)  design,  implementation,  and  analysis  of  a  household  income  and \nexpenditure survey; (iv) improvement of labor statistics collection and dissemination; and (v) upgrading of skills in \nthe National Statistics Bureau (then the Central Statistical Organization). \n3  The TA first appeared in the ADB\u2019s website project information document on 8 July 2011 and in the business \nopportunities section on 19 August 2011. ", "2   \n4.  As the main agency coordinating statistics in Bhutan, and through a government order in \nOctober  2003,  the  NSB  is  mandated  to  be  the  data  collection  arm  of  the  government, \nresponsible  for  updating  its  official  statistics.  The  NSB  is  expected  to  conduct  national \nhousehold surveys, including the BLSS. However, although an executive order of the Prime \nMinister on 26 May 2006 reaffirmed the NSB\u2019s function as the central authority for the collection, \nrelease, and custodianship of official data, other ministries have continued to collect data for \ntheir respective statistical needs. While many of these agencies expect stronger support from \nthe NSB in the form of technical advice on survey methods, staff training, and disseminating \nsurvey  results,  the  NSB\u2019s  coordination  of  data  collection  has  been  limited  to  reviewing \nquestionnaires and selecting samples for surveys. Lacking budgetary support, the NSB relies on \nsurvey data that other ministries collect for updating many official statistics. Meanwhile, the \ncapacity of staff of other government agencies to conduct surveys continues to grow, as some \nof  them  have  regular  budgets  for  conducting  surveys.  For  example,  the  Department  of \nEmployment  under  the  Ministry  of  Labour  and  Human  Resources  conducts,  solely  with \ngovernment funding, annual surveys on the labor force and business establishments, the two \nmajor sources of data for updating national statistics. \n \n5.  Through  a  World  Bank  Trust  Fund  for  Capacity  Building,  the  NSB  developed  a \ncomprehensive national statistics development strategy in 2009 that provided a framework and \naction plan for building the capacity of Bhutan\u2019s statistical system to meet current and future \ndata  needs.  There  are  delays,  however,  in  funding  and  implementing  its  major  activities. \nMeanwhile, the NSB still relies on development partners to fund important surveys such as the \n2010 Bhutan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, which was sponsored by the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund. Even if the BLSS is considered one of the most important surveys that the \nNSB has conducted, the NSB has to look for funding support and technical advice from the \ninternational  development  community  for  the  third  round.  This  is  for  lack  of  (i)  adequate \nnumbers of technical staff for survey design and operation or (ii) a regular budget for data \ncollection. The draft Statistics Act, which is part of the national statistics development strategy, \nwould have brought about the upgrading of NSB status and provided the imprimatur and budget \nnecessary  for  important  NSB  activities  such  as  the  development  and  regular,  systematic \nconduct of household and enterprise surveys needed to improve the quality and timeliness of \nofficial  statistics.  However,  the  draft  Statistics  Act,  targeted  for  completion  in  2009  and \nsupported by ADB\u2019s TA for Strengthening the National Statistical System (Phase 2), has yet to \nbe promulgated.4 \n \n6.  The BLSS cannot be postponed until appropriate government support mechanisms are \nin place. Apart from being a major data source for assessing the current 5-year plan, BLSS data \nsupports multidimensional poverty assessment and can help stakeholders in the government \nplan formulate better development perspectives. Further, the proposed assistance can advance \nthe promulgation of the draft Statistics Act, upgrade the technical skills of NSB staff, and \ndevelop an affordable sample survey strategy that will help ensure the sustainability of future \nBLSS rounds. \n \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2004.  Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening the National Statistical System \nPhase 2. Manila (TA 4424-BHU) covered (i) the provision of technical support and equipment to the NSB and the \nStatistical Board, including the finalization of the statistics act; (ii) the improvement of national accounts; and (iii) \napprenticeship programs for NSB staff. ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  intended  impact  of  the  TA  is  more  evidence-based  policy  making  for  poverty \nreduction. The expected outcome is the regular conduct of the BLSS with government support. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will consist of three major activities: (i) developing the survey strategy; (ii) \ntraining NSB technical staff, enumerators, and supervisors; and (iii) conducting, processing, and \nanalyzing the third BLSS. It is essential that the survey strategy not only generate reliable \nstatistics but should also be cost-effective, enabling the government to support future rounds \ninstead of relying on external funding. The survey strategy should address major stakeholders\u2019 \nrequirements to inform policy and provide good data support to the government\u2019s current 5-year \nplan,  2008\u20132013.  In  developing  the  strategy,  consultations  with  major  stakeholders  in  the \ngovernment, private sector, academia, and the development community will be organized to \nassess stakeholders\u2019 requirements and promote the use of the BLSS. \n \n9.  Recognizing  that  other  government  departments  may  have  already  mastered  good \npractices from regularly conducting surveys, representatives from the ministries of (i) agriculture \nand forests, (ii) education, (iii) health, (iv) and labor and human resources, as well as the Gross \nNational Happiness Commission, will be invited to participate in a advisory committee that will \nadvise  the  NSB  on  the  survey  questionnaire  and  operations  plan,  data  analysis,  and  the \ndissemination of the survey report. The work with the advisory committee can serve as a \nstarting point for the NSB\u2019s enhancing its coordination of data collection. \n \n10.  The methods of previous rounds of the BLSS will be analyzed, and the design of other \ncountries\u2019 household surveys with viable sampling will be carefully studied to plan sample \nselection for the 2011 BLSS and succeeding rounds. The possibility of assessing the impact of \nADB projects in Bhutan using the 2007 and 2011 BLSS will be explored and, if deemed possible, \nthe sampling design and survey operations will be planned accordingly. The development of all \nsurvey instruments\u2014questionnaire, survey operations plans including manuals, and sampling \ndesign\u2014will be documented for future rounds of the BLSS. \n \n11.  The skills of NSB technical staff will be upgraded through on-the-job training and a \nformal training program on survey methods that will be offered by the TA team during review \nmissions.5 Survey  operations  will  be  planned  to  ensure  the  correct  implementation  of  the \nsampling  design,  optimal  use  of  available  resources,  and  control  of  non-sampling  errors. \nMoreover, NSB technical staff will train enumerators and supervisors to minimize measurement \nerrors. \n \n12.  To further ensure skills upgrading in the NSB technical team, 2011 BLSS data will be \nprocessed, validated, and analyzed by the NSB technical team in close coordination with the \ninternational consultant and the TA team. Analysis results will be presented in the survey report, \nwhich will be widely disseminated through workshops and on the NSB and ADB websites. The \npublic  utility  file  of  the  2011  BLSS  will  be  compiled  for  policy  research  purposes.

Cost and Financing \n13.  The cost of the TA is estimated to be $300,000. The government has requested ADB to \nfinance $300,000 to cover the costs of planning and conducting the survey, analyzing the \nresults, and writing the report on the 2011 BLSS; of international consultant services; and of the \ndissemination  workshop.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform  of  office  accommodation  and  counterpart  staff remuneration  and  per  diem. The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The NSB will be the executing agency for the TA. It will organize consultations with \nstakeholders, convene the advisory committee, and form the technical team that will work \nclosely with the TA team and international consultant to develop survey instruments, analyze \nthe results, and write the survey report. The TA will be implemented over 14 months from \nOctober 2011 to December 2012. \n \n15.  The TA will finance 1 person-month of international consulting services. ADB will engage \nan individual consultant in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). The terms of reference for the consultant are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The procurement of \nequipment, if any, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Any equipment will be handed over to the NSB upon TA completion. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for the Third Bhutan Living Standards Survey, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.
