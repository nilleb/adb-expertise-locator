INTRODUCTION \n1.  The awareness of the importance of private sector development (PSD) for sustainable \neconomic growth has increased substantially in Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) \nover the past several years, contributing to a growing demand for more private sector-related \nprograms. To meet this demand, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) established the Pacific \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative (PSDI),1 which leverages ADB's strategic focus on PSD2 \nby  providing  a  unique  rapid-response  capability  for  private  sector-related  reform  and  the \nnecessary resources for crosscutting and core analytic work and advocacy. Building on the \nfindings of comprehensive analyses and private sector assessments (PSAs),3 the PSDI focuses \non  (i)  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  reform  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs),  (ii) \ncommercial legal reform, (iii) promoting access to financial services, and (iv) mainstreaming \nPSD and themes across sectors. The PSDI's comprehensive approach has proven to be cost-\neffective and results-oriented. The vast learning experiences brought about by the PSDI have \nalso facilitated effective benchmarking among countries across the practice areas.4 \n \n2.  The response of Pacific governments to both the analyses and the technical reforms \nfinanced through the PSDI has been strongly positive.5 Demand for further PSD work has \nincreased rapidly, far exceeding expectations, and there is a strong desire by Pacific DMCs for \nADB  to  intensify  PSD  reform  support.  Due  to  this  great  demand,  PSDI  resources  will  be \ndepleted shortly. The proposed technical assistance (TA) will build upon the achievements of \nthe PSDI, albeit with a strong focus on reform implementation and catalyzing investment. It \nreflects ADB's long-term commitment to supporting private sector-led economic growth6 and \nresponds to Pacific DMCs' prioritization of, and demand for, PSD reform. The TA ensures \ncontinuity of ADB\u2019s assistance\u2014one of the key lessons from Pacific reform evaluations.7 The \nregional character of the TA helps achieve economies of scale in ADB\u2019s support to Pacific \nDMCs, while promoting regional learning, transfer of know-how, and benchmarking. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and a summary of PSDI achievements and lessons \nto date is in Appendix 2.8  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Knowledge products. ADB\u2019s analytical work underpins PSDI interventions in its core \npractice areas. In-depth analysis of the environment for private sector activity within countries, \noften done through PSAs (footnote 3), has served to identify and prioritize reform needs. The \nlow levels of competitiveness, investment, productivity, and economic growth in the Pacific \nregion are largely due to the high costs of doing business and the inadequacies of institutions in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Moreover, most of ADB\u2019s country assistance strategies in the Pacific now prioritize PSD. \n3  Since 2003, ADB has carried out PSAs in eight Pacific DMCs and a regional PSA, which are available at \nhttp://www.adb.org/PrivateSector/development/assessments.asp. \n4  ADB. 2008.

Common  PSD  issues  and \nchallenges facing most Pacific DMCs include (i) the pervasive role of the state in many aspects \nof  economic  activity,  thereby  inadvertently  exacerbating  rather  than  ameliorating  problems \nassociated  with  size  and  geographical  isolation;  (ii)  the  failure  of  financial  markets  to \nintermediate efficiently and provide access to financial services for the private sector, especially \nin rural areas; (iii) business laws and regulations that are outdated and inadequate to support \nmodern business transactions; (iv) inefficient, unreliable, and often costly infrastructure and \nservices, commonly provided by SOEs, which places an unnecessary burden both on business \nand government; and (v) lack of competition as a result of small market size, public or private \nsector monopolies, and ineffective regulation.  The impact of the global economic crisis in the \nregion has accentuated the need for critical structural and institutional reforms to make the \neconomies more flexible, productive, and competitive for the medium term.  \n \n4.  To increase awareness of these issues, a PSDI communications strategy has been \nimplemented. PSD policy and coordination advisers in selected Pacific DMCs, high-level public\u2013\nprivate dialogue, PSD advocacy seminars and training workshops, the publication of private \nsector policy briefs, and numerous PSD-related articles, opinion and editorial pieces, and media \ninterviews have been significant components of the strategy.  \n \n5.  State-owned enterprise reform. Substantial progress has been made in implementing \nSOE reforms, particularly in Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga where a number of SOEs are \ncurrently undergoing restructuring and, in some cases, the privatization of one or more business \nlines. The first ever comparative study of the performance of SOEs in selected Pacific countries \nwas published in early 2009. The study, which will be extended to other countries under the \nproposed TA, has received broad media coverage and raised awareness of the costs of the \nSOE sectors in the Pacific and the lessons that can be drawn from the reform experiences \nthroughout  the  region.9  In  the  context  of  the  global  economic  crisis  and  the  fiscal  drain \nrepresented by the SOE sectors, the appetite for SOE reform is growing in the region. The \nproposed TA will continue to support the SOE reform programs and advocate for SOE reform \nthroughout the region. \n \n6.  Public\u2013private  partnerships.  The  PSDI  has  been  actively  promoting  PPPs  as  a \nmechanism to improve the delivery of infrastructure and public services. A PPP policy for Papua \nNew Guinea (PNG) was developed and adopted by the government in 2008, and this policy is \nnow under implementation so that a first group of pilot transactions can be initiated in 2010. This \nis only the second PPP framework in the Pacific, and is expected to lead to the first functioning \nPPP center. Concurrently, a road maintenance outsourcing framework has been developed for \nTonga, and similar opportunities to outsource public services and community service obligations \nare being pursued. Regionally, technical training on PPPs has been provided to a large number \nof senior officials from 10 countries, helping to support a better understanding of the scope, \napplication, and potential benefits of PPPs. The proposed TA will continue to support the \nidentification,  promotion,  piloting,  and  implementation  of  PPP  transactions,  as  well  as  the \ndevelopment of policy, legal, and institutional PPP frameworks.  \n \n7.  Commercial  legal  reform.  Key  achievements  include  the  drafting  of  innovative \ncompanies bills and insolvency legislation, the design of company registries, reform diagnostics \nand implementation plans for a regional contracting framework, and capacity development in \ncompetition policy, consumer protection, and sector regulation. The approach of developing \nregional  best  practice  and  adjusting  this  to  the  specific  circumstances  in  each  country \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2009. Finding Balance: Making State-Owned Enterprises Work in Fiji Islands, Samoa, and Tonga. Sydney. \n ", "  3\nconcerned, combined with capacity development in legal reform and the implementation of new \nlegal  frameworks,  has  proven  highly  successful  and  cost-effective.  The  proposed  TA  will \ncontinue efforts to implement the new business law frameworks, especially in the areas of \ncompany  law  and  their  associated  institutions  (i.e.,  registries),  developing  a  multi-country \ncontracting code with regional application, and strengthening competition policy and further \nefforts to promote competition in the region. \n \n8.  Access  to  finance. ADB's  access  to  finance  program  in  the  Pacific  has  achieved \nsuccess in (i) improving outreach to rural areas and outlying islands through the use of new and \ninnovative business models and the latest technological advances; (ii) developing microcredit \nand other products for the rural markets; and (iii) reforming the enabling environment for finance, \nincluding secured transactions frameworks, to broaden the forms of collateral available against \nwhich to borrow. ADB has helped establish secured transactions frameworks in five countries. \nOptions for branchless banking have been assessed in three countries, and the transfer of \nownership of a microfinance institution toward restructuring into a small commercial bank was \nfacilitated. The proposed TA will continue to help expand access to finance through secured \ntransactions registries, microfinance partnerships, the application of new electronic technologies \nto branchless banking models, and supporting regulatory reforms.  \n \n9.  Lessons learned. The PSDI has created strong momentum for further, deeper reform \nengagement in the Pacific DMCs. Important lessons learned for the proposed TA include: the \nneed  for  sound  diagnostics  and  communication;  realism  in  terms  of  political  readiness, \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  sufficient  time  for  implementation;  innovation,  flexibility,  and \nopportunism in promoting investment; the benefits of a rapid response capability; the need for \nregional learning and benchmarking; and the importance of close collaboration and coordination \namong development partners (see Appendix 2 for details). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  Pacific  DMCs  by  promoting  higher \nproductivity, investment, and economic growth, as measured by improved trends in private \nsector  investment,  economic  growth  rates,  and  an  increased  private  sector  share  in  the \neconomy. TA outcome will be the implementation of focused reform strategies and measures, \nand project designs for an improved business enabling environment with emphasis on the core \nthemes of SOE reform and PPPs, business law and regulation, competition policy, access to \nfinance, and mainstreaming PSD across sectors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  General. The TA will build on the achievements of the PSDI, in particular the analytical \nfoundations, strong partnerships developed with key counterparts and reformers across the \nregion, and ongoing reform work. The TA will enhance the level of engagement through a \nspecial focus on reform implementation and catalyzing investment. Moreover, options will be \nexplored to leverage PSD partnerships through programmatic approaches. The TA will seek to \nestablish a better understanding and analytical depth of gender issues in doing business in the \nPacific DMCs, and seek to promote gender as an integral part of the PSD portfolio, in particular \n ", "4  \nin business law and regulation and access to finance.10 The TA will have two main output \ncategories\u2014policy  advisory  and  rapid  response,  and  transactions  support\u2014and  will  be \ndelivered  mainly  through  the  provision  of  short-term  expertise  for  subprojects  in  the  core \npractice areas, in support of reform-oriented governments and champions for change in Pacific \nDMCs.  \n \n12.  Policy  advisory.  Advisory  PSD  support  will  include  advocacy,  research,  and \ncommunication; targeted technical advice and capacity development; and the promotion of \nregional cooperation and results monitoring and benchmarking. In addition to maintaining and \nexpanding ongoing subprojects and programs and responding to reform opportunities, a number \nof initiatives that had been prepared under the PSDI will be implemented by the proposed TA: (i) \nimplementing  SOE  reforms  and  PPP  frameworks;  (ii)  developing  and  implementing  new \nbusiness law frameworks, especially in the areas of company law and secured transactions law; \n(iii) establishing or modernizing business registries\u2014both company and asset registries\u2014and \npromoting regional cooperation and integration; (iv) developing a multicountry contracting code \nwith regional application, an initiative strongly endorsed by regional investor associations, the \njudiciary, and legal practitioners; (v) strengthening of competition policy and its supporting \ninstitutional and legal frameworks; and (vi) rolling out rural and microfinance support projects, \nincluding the application of new technologies and branchless models.  \n \n13.  Transactions  support.  The  TA  will  provide  transactions  support  for  PSD-related \nprojects. This will include the promotion, design, due diligence, appraisal, and implementation of \nprivate sector projects (in close cooperation with ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department), \nPPPs, or PSD-related public sector projects. PPP initiatives will include specific transactions as \nwell as the establishment and promotion of PPP project development facilities, where feasible, \nto help build deal pipelines, combined with capacity development. Public sector projects could \ninclude the development of microfinance support projects, for which there is an increasing \ninterest and demand in the region. \n \n14.  Results  management.  A  comprehensive  performance  measurement  tool  was \ndeveloped  under  the  PSDI.  The  framework  seeks  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of  PSDI-\nsupported technical assistance, as well as, more broadly, the impact of policy and legal reforms \nand donor investments in PSD in the Pacific. The framework is based on (i) country-level \nanalysis of constraints to PSD; (ii) measurement of progress along an agreed set of PSD \nindicators  in  each  country;  and  (iii)  on  the  project  level,  measurement  of  progress  and \nachievements of individual PSDI-financed technical interventions. Benchmarking options are \nbuilt into the framework on all levels. Developing a more in-depth monitoring and evaluation \nframework will be a feature of the proposed TA. \n \n15.  Donor coordination. The TA will seek to continue to expand the donor coordination \nmechanisms of the PSDI in order to ensure that the directives of the Cairns Compact on \nStrengthening Development Coordination in the Pacific are fulfilled. Under the PSDI, quarterly \nPSD  donor  meetings,  joint  missions,  joint  programming  and  information  sharing  have \nsignificantly enhanced the effectiveness of PSD interventions in the Pacific. Cooperation in \ncommercial law reform, business registry reform, joint investments, and microfinance is ongoing \n                                                 \n10  Potential gender impact is particularly expected from legal business reform and access to finance activities. For \ninstance, companies law reform will allow women to incorporate companies quickly and inexpensively, and \nimprove women\u2019s access to commercial activities by simplifying procedures for women\u2019s groups to incorporate \ncompanies. Secured transactions reform will provide women with greater opportunity to borrow against a range of \npersonal assets, which currently is either not possible legally or is prohibitively expensive. Microfinance will benefit \nwomen and their families by providing the necessary financing of business activity.    \n ", "  5\nand  will  be  extended.  Under  the  proposed  TA,  ADB  will  play  a  key  role  in  the  new \nmicrofinance/financial inclusion group with AusAID, NZAID, UNDP, and World Bank/IFC, which \nwill further enhance programming effectiveness. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $12.0 million equivalent. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis: $3.0 million by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF \u2013 other \nsources), and $9.0 million by the Government of Australia. The cofinanced amounts will be \nadministered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB, through its Pacific Department (PARD), will be the executing agency and will be \nresponsible for the overall implementation of the TA. The TA will be managed by ADB's Pacific \nLiaison and Coordination Office, supported by TA consultants. PARD\u2019s regional management \nteam (RMT), led by the director general, will provide strategic and tactical guidance. RMT \napproval  of  design  and  implementation  arrangements  will  be  required  for  TA  subprojects \nexceeding $500,000. While ADB will be solely responsible for managing the identification and \nimplementation of project activities within the framework of its individual country strategies, \nparticipating Pacific DMC governments and other key stakeholders will be consulted. No TA \nfunds will be disbursed for any subproject without ADB first obtaining endorsement from the \nrelevant Pacific DMCs for a specific subproject to be financed under the TA. \n \n18.  The TA will have a term of 4 years and will be implemented from January 2010 to \nDecember 2013. The implementation of TA activities will require the services of international \nconsultants (up to 300 person-months) and national consultants (up to 150 person-months). The \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Taking into account critical design features of the TA, the TA will require a mix of national \nand  international  consultants  with  various  expertise  and  skill  sets,  as  well  as  a  mix  of \nrecruitment approaches involving both individuals and firms. For firms and individuals, indefinite \ndelivery contracts would be used where appropriate. Firms will also be contracted through a mix \nof quality-based selection, single source selection where appropriate, and quality- and cost-\nbased selection, as is most appropriate for the circumstances of each assignment. Detailed \nterms of reference for the consultants will be developed in close coordination with ADB\u2019s Central \nOperations Services Office. Equipment and materials to be financed under the TA will be \nprocured by the consultants or by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to \ntime). Comprehensive annual progress reports outlining achievements and lessons learned will \nbe produced for the TA. An independent midterm performance audit will be carried out. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $9,000,000, to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Australia; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis, for the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative \nPhase II. \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \n \nPRELIMINARY DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting   \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nContribution to  Improved business  Government statistics  Government commitment \npoverty reduction by  environment in  Central Bank reports  to and ownership of PSD \npromoting private  participating Pacific  ADB economic reports  reforms \nenterprise,  DMCs as demonstrated  and updates  Political stability in \ninvestment, and  by improved trends in  ADB Pacific PSD  participating Pacific \neconomic growth  economic growth rates,  indicators database   DMCs \n  increased private sector    No major natural \nshare of gross domestic  disasters \nproduct, and increased   \nRisk \nforeign and domestic \nLimited private sector \nprivate sector investment \nresponse to improved \nrates \ninvestment climate \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nPacific island  Measurable  Annual TA progress  Government commitment \ngovernments  improvement in the  reports  to, and approval and \nimplement focused  business environment as  Independent midterm  ownership of, PSD reform \nreform strategies and  demonstrated by  performance audit (TA  strategies, approaches, \nmeasures, and  selected indicators for  funded)   practices, and activities \nproject designs for an  SOE reform and PPPs,  TA client survey  can be achieved \nimproved business  access to finance, and  ADB economic reports  Support for reform \nenabling environment   business law and  and updates  activities by the private \nregulation  ADB Pacific PSD  sector, unions, and other \n  indicators database   key stakeholders \nMemoranda of  Private sector   \nRisk \nunderstanding between  assessments \nSlow pace of reform \nproject sponsors and  Government and central \nimplementation \nfinanciers  bank reports and \n \nstatistics \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.

About the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative  \n1.  The  Pacific  Private  Sector  Development  Initiative  (PSDI)  is  a  regional  technical \nassistance (TA) project of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), cofinanced by the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID).1 Its main objective is to promote private-sector-\nled, sustainable economic growth in ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member countries (DMCs). The \nPSDI leverages existing ADB country partnership strategies by providing a rapid-response \ncapability for private sector development (PSD) reform, as well as necessary resources for core \nanalytical work and advocacy. Specifically, the PSDI addresses the binding constraints on \nprivate-sector-led economic growth in the Pacific by supporting (i) state-owned enterprise (SOE) \nreform and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), (ii) commercial legal reform, (iii) finance sector \nreform to promote access to financial services, and (iv) mainstreaming of PSD and themes \nacross sectors. PSDI activities are implemented using a mix of country-specific and regional \ninitiatives that cover analytical work, technical assistance, capacity development, and advocacy. \n \n2.  The PSDI was approved on 21 November 2006 for $8.7 million, cofinanced by AusAID \nwith $7.6 million. The TA budget was increased in 2008 by additional cofinancing from AusAID \nof $0.3 million, thereby bringing the total budget amount to $9.0 million.2  \n \nB.  Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative Goals \n3.  PSDI activities are designed to translate into measurable contributions to economic \ngrowth in the Pacific region by (i) increasing the quantum of private investment; (ii) improving \naccess to finance and financial services to the private sector; (iii) increasing the number of \nprivate businesses created and registered, and reducing the associated costs; (iv) improving \naccess and reducing the costs of using the commercial legal framework; (v) improving the \nquality and accessibility of infrastructure services; (vi) encouraging competition and creating \nopportunities  for  private  sector  participation  in  markets  currently  dominated  by  SOEs  and \ngovernment departments; and (vii) strengthening the overall financial performance of SOEs, \nthereby reducing their drain on public funds and improving their performance. \n \nC.  Operational Highlights   \n4.  The response of Pacific island governments to both the analysis and the technical \nreforms financed through the PSDI has been strongly positive. As of 31 December 2008, 52 \nreform projects worth about $7.5 million have been initiated through the PSDI. Cumulative \ndisbursements were $4.9 million and total commitments were $7.5 million, or 83% of the total \nPSDI budget. \n \n5.  The majority of PSDI projects have been regional or multicountry initiatives, and the \ncountry distribution of projects have reflected the countries\u2019 demand for initiatives in support of \nPSD. Of the nine Pacific countries that have received PSDI support, Tonga has had the largest \nshare (15%), reflecting the commitment of senior policy makers from government, led by the \nprime minister, to implement key PSD reforms. The PSDI has continued to extend its reach \n                                                 \n1  Further details on PSDI achievements to date can be obtained from PSDI annual progress reports for 2007 and \n2008.

The PSDI has made substantial progress in implementing SOE reforms and preparing \nthe groundwork for increased private sector participation in the delivery of infrastructure and \npublic services with raised awareness of their benefits at the country and regional level. The \nfollowing are highlights of the PSDI's outputs and achievements in the area of SOE reform and \nPPPs: \n(i)  A comparative analysis of SOE performance and reform experiences in the Fiji \nIslands, Samoa, and Tonga4 was published in early 2009, generating significant \nregional interest, most notably in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Vanuatu. A \nhigh-level seminar involving the top leadership of Samoa and Tonga, and senior \nofficials from the Fiji Islands, was held in February 2009. As one outcome of the \nseminar, the prime minister of Samoa sponsored a cabinet paper calling for the \nremoval of all civil servants and ministers from SOE boards.  \n(ii)  PSDI-supported seminars on best practices for delivering community service \nobligations (CSOs) in the Fiji Islands, PNG, Samoa, and Tonga have led to the \ndevelopment and refinement of CSO guidelines for Samoa and Tonga. As a \n                                                 \n3  In some countries, PSDI work is significantly leveraged by other ADB TA. For instance, in 2008, $285,000 was \ndisbursed in Papua New Guinea via ADB TA, in addition to the $275,000 disbursed through the PSDI. \n4  ADB. 2009.

In 2007, under the PSDI, \nan in-depth analysis of the reform options for the loss-making Samoa Shipping \nServices was carried out. The PSDI also funded the fielding of a full-time advisor \nto  work  with  the  State-Owned  Enterprise  Monitoring  Division  (SOEMD)  for \nseveral months in late 2007 and early 2008, during which time an SOE reform \npipeline for 2008\u20132012 was prepared, and support was given to implement the \ngovernment\u2019s newly issued policy on CSOs. The advisor also helped the SOEMD \nto review and comment on SOE corporate plans (on an ongoing basis). Ongoing \nsupport has also been provided to the Samoa Institute of Directors to deliver \ntraining courses to SOE directors and to develop a business plan for financial \nsustainability. \n(v)  In Solomon Islands, the PSDI supported the passage of the SOE Act in 2007 and \nthe privatization of Home Finance Limited in 2009. Preparations for the sale of \nSasape Marina are ongoing.  \n(vi)  The PSDI supplemented ADB TA5 to rationalize five Tongan SOEs in 2007\u20132008 \nwith a full-time PSD advisor to the prime minister and support on CSOs. The \ninitiative has resulted in the first privatization in Tonga, with the successful sale of \nthe Leiola Duty Free stores. Four other SOEs were rationalized with one being \nwound up and three restructured. A new phase of the rationalization program is \nnow under way, which is even more ambitious and could involve eight SOEs, \nplus the completion of a number of ongoing rationalizations. \n(vii)  As cofinanced between the PSDI and separate ADB TA,6 a PPP policy was \ndeveloped for and endorsed by the Government of PNG in 2008. The policy, \ndrafted in close collaboration with a multiagency task force, is only the second \nsuch policy to be drafted in the Pacific (following the Fiji Islands in 2006, also with \nADB  support), 7 and  represents  the  first  step  in  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive PPP framework for PNG. The PPP framework will be completed \nin 2009 through establishing a PPP center, enacting necessary implementing \nlaws and regulations, and developing a preliminary PPP project pipeline.   \n(viii)  In Tonga, significant progress was made in outsourcing the road maintenance \nfunctions of the Ministry of Works. A detailed diagnostic was conducted to assess \nthe  feasibility  and  impact  of  the  outsourcing  as  well  as  to  establish  a  work \nprogram\u2014all of which was endorsed for implementation by cabinet in 2008. The \nprogram will be implemented in 2009 and 2010, and is expected to result in a 3-\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.

One of the workshops was \nundertaken in collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat, and one with the \nADB Institute. The courses were attended by more than 50 senior officials from \nSOEs, line ministries, and finance ministries from the Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, \nKiribati,  PNG,  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands,  Tonga,  Timor-Leste,  and  Vanuatu. \nOverall, more than 10 workshops and seminars have been conducted on SOE \nreform, PPPs, and CSOs on both the country and regional levels, with about 300 \nparticipants in total.  \n \n2.  Access to Finance \n8.  The PSDI\u2019s approach to expanding access to finance in the Pacific has recognized the \nneed to consider the broader context of finance sector development. It has also recognized the \nneed to address core constraints in the enabling environment for finance through partnerships \nwith microfinance institutions, leveraging new technologies to lower the costs of rural access, \nand  supporting  collateral  reform.  The  following  are  highlights  of  the  PSDI's  outputs  and \nachievements in the area of access to finance: \n(i)  Options for piloting branchless banking technologies were developed in PNG, \nTimor-Leste, Tonga, and Vanuatu, including integrating remittance inflows with \ndomestic  transfers  and  payments.  The  PSDI  helped  prepare  the  pilot  of  a \nbranchless banking program with the National Bank of Vanuatu, which is now \nongoing  under  separate  TA  funding. 8   Follow-on  work  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  branchless  banking  in  PNG,  Timor-Leste,  and  Tonga  is \nprogrammed for 2010.  \n(ii)  Secured  transactions  reform  initiatives,  which  facilitate  effective  pledging  of \nmovable assets and recovery in the event of loan default, are well under way in \nseven Pacific DMCs, with a high level of support from the PSDI. Laws were \npassed in the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, and bills are \nbeing drafted for Palau, Samoa, and Tonga. Secured transactions registries were \nalso established in the Federated States of Micronesia and Vanuatu, and are \nunder way in the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, and Tonga. \n(iii)  The PSDI funded an assessment of finance sector issues in Timor-Leste, and \nprepared  the  restructuring  of  a  local  microfinance  institution  into  a  small \ncommercial bank. Implementation is expected in 2009 and 2010. Support was \nalso provided for microfinance in PNG, Samoa, and Vanuatu. \n(iv)  Major workshops and conferences were held on financial literacy and mobile \nbanking, in cooperation with other agencies such as the International Monetary \nFund, United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank.  \n \n3.  Commercial Legal Reform \n9.  The analysis of the business environment in the Pacific region indicates that Pacific \nisland countries are constrained by outdated and inappropriate laws; in many cases, laws are \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2007.

The PSDI has been working to address the urgent need to not only update these \nlaws\u2014particularly  in  the  areas  of  company  formation,  contracting,  dispute  resolution,  and \ninsolvency\u2014but tailor them to support island economies. The following are highlights of the \nPSDI's outputs and achievements in the area of commercial legal reform: \n(i)  In the Fiji Islands, a PPP policy was prepared. The PPP Act was passed in 2006. \n(ii)  The SOE Act was passed in Solomon Islands in 2007.  \n(iii)  The Electronic Transactions Act was prepared and promulgated in the Fiji Islands \nin 2008.  \n(iv)  Innovative new companies acts were drafted for Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, \nwith the Solomon Islands act passed in March 2009.  \n(v)  In Tonga, the Companies Amendment Bill was drafted in cooperation with the \nInternational Finance Corporation.  \n(vi)  Diagnostic studies and associated consultations for company registry reforms \nwere  carried  out  in  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands,  and  Vanuatu.  The \nrecommendations are scheduled for implementation in 2009\u20132010. \n(vii)  New insolvency legislation was drafted for Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. These \nnew acts will support straightforward insolvency procedures and make it easier \nfor bankruptcy receivers to carry out their obligations more quickly and at lower \ncost. \n(viii)  A reform plan was prepared for the contracting framework in the Pacific DMCs, \nwhich will simplify contracting and dispute resolution. Chief justices and other \nsenior legal stakeholders in the study countries (PNG, Solomon Islands, Tonga, \nand  Vanuatu)  have  embraced  the  recommendation  to  codify  Pacific  islands\u2019 \ncontract law.  \n(ix)  Support was provided for strengthening capacity in the Cook Islands and PNG in \ncompetition policy, consumer protection, and sector regulation, which has had a \npowerful impact, especially on PNG's mobile telecommunications sector.9  \n(x)  Microfinance law reform will soon commence in Vanuatu. \n \n4.  Mainstreaming Private Sector Development Across Sectors \n10.  ADB\u2019s analytical work underpins the PSDI's interventions in the three aforementioned \ncore  practice  areas.  In-depth  analysis  of  the  environment  for  private  sector  activity  within \ncountries, usually done through private sector assessments (PSAs), has served to identify and \nprioritize reform needs. Analytical work on various topics or themes, both on a country and \nmulticountry basis, have also been undertaken to probe deeper into specific issues. To increase \nawareness of PSD-related reform, an extensive program of dissemination and consultation has \nsupplemented the program, both within individual countries and regionally. The following are \nhighlights of the PSDI's outputs and achievements in mainstreaming PSD across sectors: \n(i)  PSAs  were  completed  for  PNG,  Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Vanuatu.10  The  PNG, \nTonga, and Vanuatu PSAs were launched with top government and business \n                                                 \n9  According  to  the  Government  of  Papua  New  Guinea,  the  introduction  of  competition  into  the  mobile \ntelecommunications sector has resulted in a 2.5% increase in gross domestic product.  \n10 ADB. 2008.

Key PSA reform recommendations are being implemented in all study \ncountries. \n(ii)  Private sector policy briefs on access to finance, legal business environment, \nPPPs, and SOE reform were published, summarizing the key issues surrounding \nthe core reforms needed to support PSD in the Pacific.11  \n(iii)  PSD policy and coordination advisers have been assigned to PNG and Tonga. \n(iv)  Numerous PSD-related articles, opinion and editorial pieces, and interviews have \nbeen published in regional and local media. \n(v)  Analytical work commenced on issues such as the development of more effective \ncontracting frameworks and promoting competition and consumer protection in \nPacific island economies, focusing on the development of regional approaches. \n(vi)  High-level public\u2013private dialogue was facilitated in PNG, Samoa, and Tonga.  \n(vii)  Twenty-two PSD advocacy seminars and training workshops were conducted in \nthe region, attended by more than 700 key stakeholders, including policy makers, \nthe media, academia, the private sector, and civil society.  \n \nD.  Lessons Learned \n11.  Over the past few years, the tenor of the discussion in the region regarding the feasibility \nof  private  sector-led  growth  has  changed  from  one  in  which  governments  were  debating \nwhether to embark on reform to deciding which reforms should be given priority. While various \ncountry and regional PSD projects have provided some essential building blocks (e.g., through \ndiagnostic work) and significant assistance targeted at specific issues, the PSDI, with its rapid-\nresponse capability, has been particularly instrumental in transforming the nascent acceptance \nof the need for PSD in Pacific DMCs into a fully fledged demand for reform in a number of areas.  \n \n12.  Innovative approaches have contributed to ADB's success in spurring the momentum for \nPSD-related  reforms  in  the  region.  Recent  developments  are  highly  encouraging  (e.g., \nliberalization  in  the  telecommunications  and  aviation  industries),  and  follow-on  effects  for \npoverty reduction are increasingly materializing (e.g., branchless banking). The following are \nimportant lessons for PSDI Phase II: \n(i)  Promoting an enabling environment for the private sector in the Pacific remains a \ncrucial  challenge  and  requires  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  various  issues \n(economic, political, cultural, etc.) and challenges facing the Pacific DMCs. \n(ii)  Reform in the Pacific region requires sound analysis, awareness building, and \nregular advocacy and outreach, involving policy makers, the private sector, the \nmedia, and civil society. Regional benchmarking is an effective advocacy tool \nand provides valuable information for monitoring progress.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \nTransforming Tonga: A Private Sector Assessment.

A  regional  (and \nmulticountry) focus facilitates learning from experiences gained from undertaking \nsimilar reforms in other Pacific DMCs while ensuring that local needs, capacity, \nand conditions are reflected in proposed reforms.  \n(iv)  A rapid-response capability brings the flexibility to quickly mobilize short-term \nexpertise as reform opportunities arise, and to demobilize promptly when political \ncommitment  wanes,  allocating  resources  where  the  demand  is  greatest  and \neffectively supporting reformer governments and champions.  \n(v)  As reform initiatives often require several years to design and implement, and \nbecause relationships take time to build, long-term engagements are needed. \nMore programmatic approaches should, therefore, be sought. \n(vi)  It is important to sequence and prioritize reforms according to the level of political \nreadiness and local capacities, and design reform measures to meet existing \ninstitutional capacity. \n(vii)  As  opportunities  for  private  sector  operations  are  limited  in  the  region,  the \napproach needs to be innovative, flexible, opportunistic, and open to possible \nengagement in nontraditional sectors, where ADB's private sector operations can \nhave a highly catalytic impact, while paying due attention to the risks involved.  \n(viii)  Close collaboration and coordination among development partners is important \nto maximize impact, especially in small, fragile states. Harmonization of PSD \nassistance, for instance through cofinancing (especially with AusAID  through \nPSDI cofinancing), has proven highly effective. \n \n13.  Taking these lessons into account, responsiveness to reform opportunities based on \nsolid analytical work should be continued, as should high-level engagement, including support \nto reformist governments and champions maintained through a highly focused yet flexible PSD \nreform program\u2014including PSD partnerships with governments and development partners\u2014\nthat address the binding constraints on growth and reflect the realities in the respective Pacific \nDMCs and regionally. \n \n                                                 \n12 Client  satisfaction  has  been  assessed  and  measured  through  client  surveys,  direct  feedback,  letters  of \nappreciation, and, ultimately, overwhelming (repeat) demand and associated requests for support by reformist \ngovernment officials. \n ", "  Appendix 3  15 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Financinga   \n  1.
