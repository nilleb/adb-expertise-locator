The  Flood  Management  Strategy  Study  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  was \napproved on 14 April 2004 in the amount of $500,000 equivalent from the Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund.  The purpose of the TA is to develop an integrated flood mitigation and floodplain \nmanagement strategy appropriate for the unique flooding and development situations in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), by balancing structural and nonstructural measures. It will \nhelp the Government move from flood control to an integrated flood management strategy. The \nExecuting Agency is the Ministry of Water Resources. TA services commenced on 20 October \n2004 for a total of 44 person-months, comprising 9 person-months of international and 35 \nperson-months of local consultants.   \n \n2.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Government develop strategies and policies to shift \nfrom past policies of flood control to an integrated flood management approach. An integrated \nflood  management  strategy  entails  integration  with  broader  water  resource  management \nobjectives. In the PRC, integrating these aspects is particularly relevant because of the water \nsupply  crisis  and  the  environmental  degradation  associated  with  rapid  development  and \nurbanization. The issues received specific mention by the vice premier last year in a speech. \nInterest  in  solving  these  problems  is  widespread  at  senior  levels  of  central  Government \nagencies. \n \n3.  The EA has requested ADB to provide supplementary financing to study the linkage \nbetween flood and water management in the PRC to identify ways that flood waters can be \nused to (i) improve groundwater recharge and offset periods of drought and rapidly growing \nwater demand in urban and rural areas, (ii) stabilize river flows needed for growing urban and \nrural use, and (iii) improve the supply of water to ecologically important habitats and overall \nwater quality. As an integrated flood and water management approach requires increasing \ncross-agency coordination, the institutional mechanisms needed to improve collaboration and \ncoordination also need further assessment. The proposal involves expanding the scope of the \nTA, which focuses on integrated flood management, to include recommendations and actions \nneeded to integrate flood management with water resource management objectives. \n \n4.  The Board is notified of the increase of the TA amount by $49,600 financed on a grant \nbasis from the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector, and the administration by ADB of the \nproposed cofinancing. In accordance with Project Administration Instructions (PAI) 5.11, paras. \n31 and 32, the Board is notified of this approval.
