", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2004 Country Programming Mission to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nthe PRC Government confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA)1 from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support development of the PRC consulting industry as a follow-up \nto the previous two ADB-supported TA projects.2 A TA fact-finding mission was fielded from 30 \nAugust to 3 September 2004. During the mission, the Government requested that the TA focus \non  formulating  a  regulation  to  enforce  application  of  the  Guidelines  on  selection  and \nengagement of consultants for Government-financed projects that was developed under TA \n3138 PRC (Guidelines). This report is based on the mission\u2019s findings in the field, and the \nunderstanding  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives  and  outputs,  scope,  cost \nestimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants for the TA. Appendix 1 gives the logical framework. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Along  with  the  PRC\u2019s  high  economic  growth,  its  consulting  industry  has  grown \nsubstantially in the past 25 years, to about 3,000 multidisciplinary consulting organizations. The \nrapid buildup of the industry was evidenced by a 13.8 factor increase of the total annual \nconsulting revenue in 5 years, from $160 million in 1996 to $3.7 billion in 2001. The industry\u2019s \ngrowth was partly due to the Government\u2019s requirement that all decisions in investment projects \nbe based on feasibility studies. National consultants have served clients of various sectors in \nboth domestic and overseas markets and have helped prepare and implement development \nprojects  financed  by  international  aid  organizations,  including  the  World  Bank  and  ADB. \nNational consultants have also provided advisory support to the Government in economic policy \nformulation and restructuring of government administration.  \n \n3.  Despite fast growth, the PRC consulting industry is still relatively immature. ADB has \nbeen requested to provide support for development of the industry since 1995. Major issues \nfacing the industry were identified through provision of two ADB TAs. In 1995 the findings of TA \n2273 PRC highlighted that the industry was lacking (i) a framework to administer and coordinate \nthe consulting industry at the national level; (ii) accessibility to information; (iii) competition and \nequal opportunity among government-owned and private consulting firms; (iv) a certification or \naccreditation system; and (v) public awareness regarding the capacity of consulting services. \nThe TA recommended options to develop a regulatory framework to resolve these issues; \nprogress has since been made.    \n \n4.  In 1999, ADB provided TA 3138 PRC to help the Government strengthen its agencies\u2019 \ncapacities  to regulate, register, select, and engage consultants to ensure that procedures are \nconsistent  with  a  market-oriented  economy  and  are  aligned  with  internationally  accepted \nstandards  in  terms  of  efficiency,  transparency,  and  competitiveness.  The  TA  prepared  (i) \nGuidelines for the Selection and Engagement of Consultants for Government Financed Projects \nin PRC and (ii) a training manual to facilitate dissemination of the Guidelines. The Guidelines \ndefine  principles  and  procedures  for  selecting  and  engaging  consultants  for  government-\nfinanced  projects.  The  Guidelines  are  also  to  standardize  consulting  services  terminology \nnationwide, and to create an environment of open competition and transparency in consultant \nselection and engagement. Under the TA, the Guidelines were pilot-tested in two government \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 23 August 2004. \n2 TA 2273 PRC (ADB. 1995. Study on the Local Consulting Industry. Manila, approved in 1995); and TA 3138 PRC \n(ADB.1999. Regulatory Framework for Engagement of Consultant. Manila, approved in 1999).  \n ", "2  \nprojects, with positive feedback from the project executing agencies and consultants. Although \nthe Guidelines were an important step in the right direction in applying competitive market-\noriented principles, they do not include legal requirements for enforcement. A regulation based \non the Guidelines, consistent with PRC procurement legislation, is needed to enforce their \nnational application. Therefore, TA 3138 PRC recommended two follow-up actions: (i) that the \nGuidelines be converted to the Regulation for the Selection and Engagement of Consultants \n(Regulation)  and  (ii)  that  the  Guidelines  be  disseminated  through  training  workshops  to \nconcerned government agencies and consulting organizations. \n \n5.  Although some issues identified under TA 2273 PRC have not yet been resolved, \nsubsequent economic development in PRC has accelerated growth of its consulting industry. \nAfter the Government\u2019s 1997 decision to undertake a nationwide ownership reform to vitalize \nstate-owned-enterprises, the Ninth National Congress, held in 1998, passed resolutions to \nrestructure government institutions. Even though reform has been slower than expected, mainly \nbecause of the nonavailability of a supporting and comprehensive social security system, the \nreforms have created a better environment for open and fair competition, as many previously \ngovernment-owned consulting organizations are becoming self-supported.    \n \n6.  In July 2004, the State Council approved Government Decree No. 20 on Reform of the \nPRC Investment System. The objective is to decentralize the government administration system \nfor investment projects and simplify government approval procedures. The new investment \npolicy requires a comprehensive regulatory framework for open and fair competition in the \ninvestment market to diversify investment resources and improve investment efficiency. With \nthe new policy now in place, consulting services will play a key role in pre-investment feasibility \nstudies  as  well  as  in  preparation,  implementation,  supervision,  and  post-evaluation  of \ninvestment projects. Consequently, the need is urgent to formulate regulations for selection and \nhiring of consultants for government-financed projects that create an environment of efficiency, \ncompetitiveness, and transparency.   \n \n7.  The  Government  is  aware  of  the  need  for  a  regulatory  framework  to  support  a \ndecentralized and market-oriented consulting industry. Because ADB earlier provided TA to the \nGovernment to develop national procurement regulations,3 the Government requested this TA  \nto formulate a regulation to govern the rapidly growing consulting industry. Considering the \nmore narrow sectoral focus of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MST), the Executing \nAgency (EA) for TA 3138 PRC, the Government identified the  National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC) which has broader-based mandate compared to MST, to be EA \nfor the TA. \n    \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The objective of the advisory TA is to help the Government formulate the Regulation for \nSelection and Engagement of Consultants and disseminate it to enforce application of the \nGuidelines nationwide. Intensive training will be provided to government executing agencies and \nconsulting organizations and firms after Government approval of the Regulation. Use of the \nGuidelines by project executing agencies will ensure that consultants with required expertise are \n                                                 \n3  TA 2854 PRC (ADB. 1997.  Establishment of National Procurement Regulations for the Public Sector. Manila, \napproved in 1997); TA 3631 PRC (ADB. 2001.  Formulation of the Government Procurement Law.  Manila,  \napproved in February 2001).   ", "  3\nselected  at  appropriate  market  cost  for  government-financed  projects.  Formulation  of  the \nRegulation is in line with the Government\u2019s overachieving goal to achieve good governance, \nimprove economic efficiency, and combat corruption to develop a modern and effective market-\noriented economy.     \n \n 9,  The TA will (i) update the Guidelines prepared under TA 3138 PRC; (ii) draft a regulation \nbased  on  the  updated  Guidelines;  (iii)  develop  training  manuals  for  the  Regulation  and \nGuidelines as attachments to the Regulation; (iv) conduct dissemination and training workshops \nfor concerned government agencies and consulting organizations and firms; and (v) develop a \nframework for a monitoring mechanism for the Government to enforce implementation of the \nRegulation and the Guidelines.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will undertake the following key activities: (i) review the experiences and lessons \nlearned in the pilot application of the Guidelines prepared under TA 3138 PRC; (ii) review \ngenerally applicable procedures now used for Government-financed projects; (iii) update the \nGuidelines as necessary, based on the review of (i) and (ii); (iv) draft the Regulation based on \nthe updated Guidelines; (v) conduct review and consultation workshops to obtain inputs and \ncomments on the draft Regulation from concerned line ministries and representatives of the \nconsulting industry; (vi) finalize the draft Regulation for NDRC\u2019s approval; (vii) develop training \nmanuals and conducting intensive training programs, including training workshops and training \nof trainers programs on the Regulation and Guidelines for concerned government agencies and \nconsulting organizations and firms; (viii) launch a national awareness campaign by holding new \nrelease  conferences  and  posting  the  Regulation  and  Guidelines  on  relevant  Government \nauthorized  websites,  newspapers  and  magazines;  and  (viii)  develop  the  framework  for  a \nmonitoring  mechanism  for  NDRC  and  concerned  line  ministries  to  establish  an  effective \nmonitoring system to implement the Regulation and Guidelines.             \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA cost is estimated at $390,000 equivalent, of which $103,000 is foreign exchange \ncost and $287,000 equivalent is local currency cost. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance  $300,000  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $197,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto $90,000, through remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, office accommodation and \ncommunication facilities, training venue and facilities, interpreting services, and administrative \nsupport. Appendix 2 gives detailed cost estimates and the proposed financing plan.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  NDRC will be the EA for the TA. Within NDRC, the Investment Department will supervise \nthe consultants in drafting the Regulation, and coordinate with concerned line ministries to \nachieve endorsement of the Regulation and organize training workshops for dissemination of \nthe Regulation and Guidelines. NDRC is anticipated to approve and issue the Regulation as a \nGovernment decree during the third quarter of 2005. An advisory committee will be established, \ncomprising senior representatives from MOF, NDRC, MST, the Ministry of Commerce, and the \nMinistry of Construction to guide TA implementation. The advisory committee will work closely \nwith NDRC to establish a monitoring and mechanism system to enforce project executing \nagencies to apply the Regulation and Guidelines. A senior official, at the director general level in \n ", "4  \nthe NDRC investment department, will be project director for TA execution. The China National \nAssociation  of  Engineering  Consultants  (CNAEC),  affiliated  to  NDRC  as  PRC\u2019s  largest \nconsulting association, will help NDRC\u2019s investment department in TA implementation. CNAEC \nwill also help NDRC organize training workshops and post the Regulation and Guidelines on \nrelevant  government-authorized  web  sites,  and  in  newspapers  and  magazines,  including \nCNAEC\u2019s web site and monthly magazine.   \n \n13.  The TA should begin in March 2005, and will be implemented in two phases over 18 \nmonths. During the first phase, consultants will review and update the Guidelines prepared \nunder TA 3138 PRC. Based on the revised Guidelines, consultants will draft the regulation, to \nbe reviewed in consultation workshops. Comments will be incorporated in the draft Regulation.  \nThe Regulation will be finalized in the format of a legal government document, and will be \nendorsed jointly by concerned line ministries before NDRC\u2019s approval. After NDRC\u2019s approval \nand issuance of the Regulation, phase two of the TA will focus on dissemination of the \nRegulation and Guidelines through various training programs, including training workshops and \ntraining of trainers programs. The trainees will be from central and provincial government \nagencies across the country, and from large consulting firms at the national and provincial \nlevels.  \n \n14.  The TA will require 3 person-months of international and 15 person-months of domestic \nconsultants. Appendix 3 outlines the terms of reference for consultants. All consultants will be \nrecruited on individual bases in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n15.  The domestic consulting services specialist-team leader will, in collaboration with other \nconsultants,  consolidate  and  submit  reports  required  by  ADB.  An  inception  report  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB and NDRC within 2 weeks after TA fieldwork begins, which will include a \ndetailed work plan including the methodology for drafting the Regulation, its time frame for \nfinalization  and  approval,  and  the  methodology  for  dissemination  of  the  Regulation  and \nGuidelines. This will be reviewed and approved by ADB and NDRC at the first tripartite meeting \nin consultation with the advisory committee. An interim report that includes the draft Regulation \nand a training plan will be submitted within 3 months after submission of the inception report. \nThe Advisory Committee and consulting industry representatives will review and comment on \nthe draft regulation at consultation workshops. The training consultant will design training \nprograms and prepare training manuals for the Regulation and Guidelines. Two sets of training \nmanuals will be prepared: one for government agencies, and the other for consulting firms. \nUpon NDRC\u2019s approval and issuance of the Regulation, the training consultant will conduct \ntraining workshops with assistance from CNAEC and other consultants. The training consultant \nwill submit a brief training evaluation report after each training workshop. Based on the training, \nconsultants will help NDRC and concerned line ministries develop a framework monitoring \nmechanism to implement the Regulation and Guidelines. The draft final report, to be submitted \nwithin 2 months before TA completion, will include (i) an overall evaluation of dissemination and \ntraining for the Regulation and Guidelines, (ii) a framework of the monitoring mechanism, and \n(iii) recommendations for follow-up actions to further strengthen the regulatory framework for the \nPRC consulting industry. Consultants will submit the final report to ADB and NDRC within 1 \nmonth after the final tripartite meeting.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by  the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to ", "  5\nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Formulation  of  the  Regulation  for \nSelection  and  Engagement  of  Consultants  for  Government-Financed  Projects,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board.       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK  \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Key Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal        \n1.
