INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management (PPP) was established in response \nto demand for capacity building in development management for officials in Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) countries. As a legacy of the first GMS summit in November 2002, it is a \npioneering  program  to  build  civil  servants\u2019  capacity  in  public  policy  and  development \nmanagement and promote regional cooperation in the countries of the GMS. The PPP has \nreceived funding of $7.8 million since its inception in 2003.1 It is designed as a continuing project, \nwith each phase building on the experiences and lessons of previous phases.  \n \n2.  The GMS leadership continues to recognize the PPP as a leading and unique capacity-\ndevelopment program making a significant contribution to knowledge generation and enhancing \nthe skills of government officials and policy makers in the subregion. At the third GMS summit, \nin March 2008 in Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), the GMS heads of \nstate lauded the key role of PPP in building capacity in the subregion. Further, at the 15th GMS \nMinisterial Meeting in June 2009 in Hua Hin, Thailand, the GMS ministers articulated the need \nfor additional support to allow the PPP to extend its reach and quality. GMS civil servants need \ncontinuing and longer-term support to strengthen their capacity for informed policy formulation \nand the enhanced design and management of development programs and projects. At the \nrequest of the GMS governments, a fourth phase of the PPP will be implemented. The design \nand monitoring framework of the capacity-development technical assistance (TA) is in Appendix \n1.2 The PPP is an integral component of the GMS human resource development strategic \nframework, specifically in the education subsector, and is in the action plan. It is in line with the \nstrategic thrusts of the GMS regional cooperation strategy and program, specifically pillar 3 on \naddressing health and other social, economic, and capacity-building issues associated with \nsubregional links. The TA is in the pipeline projects for nonlending products and services in \nADB's regional cooperation operations business plan, 2009\u20132011.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The GMS countries have limited capacity to maximize the benefits and mitigate economic, \nenvironmental, and social risks associated with subregional cooperation. The subregion needs a \ncompetent and skilled civil service to manage national and regional programs and to establish \nan appropriate policy environment for regional cooperation and integration. GMS civil servants \nneed to acquire knowledge, develop skills, and imbibe shared vision and values for GMS \ncooperation to design and implement effective and efficient policies and strategies, as well as \nprograms and projects promoting regional cooperation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The PPP had three phases: (i) Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2002. Technical Assistance for the Greater \nMekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management. Manila (TA 6056-REG, approved on 25 \nOctober, for $800,000 as a grant from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund with supplementary funding from \nthe  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development  (NZAID)  of  $350,000).  (ii)  ADB.  2005.  Technical \nAssistance for Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management II. Manila (TA 6237-\nREG, approved on 29 March, for $800,000 as a grant). Supplementary funding was provided by NZAID ($850,000), \nthe Government of France through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ($1,923,000), and the People\u2019s Republic of China \nRegional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund ($500,000). (iii) ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Greater \nMekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management III. Manila (TA 6407-REG, approved in \nAugust, for $1,000,000 as a grant. Supplementary funding provided by NZAID ($400,000), the Government of \nFrance through Agence Francaise De Developpement (about $900,000), the People's Republic of China Regional \nCooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  ($500,000),  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership Fund ($500,000).  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 November 2009.  \n3   ADB. 2008.  Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan, 2009\u22122011. Manila. \n ", "2  \n4.  A  key  development  constraint  on  GMS  cooperation  is  inadequate  capacity  in  GMS \ngovernments to align and integrate national and subregional plans. Subregional integration \nrequires  leadership  and  development  management  capacity  that  are  different  from  those \nrequired  to  meet  national  development  goals.  Developing  GMS  civil  servants\u2019  capacity4 in \nleadership, public policy formulation and implementation, development management, and the \nintegration of crosscutting areas and sector-specific development will enhance the meaningful \nand effective participation of GMS governments in regional cooperation initiatives. \n \n5.  As  GMS  countries  face  more  complex  challenges  of  economic  development,  the \nimportance  of  harnessing  knowledge  for  better-informed  policy  choices  has  become  more \ncritical.  Increasingly,  knowledge  has  become  an  important  source  of  leverage  in  shaping \neffective and responsive policies. Recognizing this, the TA aims to promote more effective links \namong knowledge generation, acquisition, and dissemination and policy formulation. \n \n6.  Since  its  inception,  the  PPP  has  delivered  72  demand-based  learning  programs \nbenefiting over 1,365 junior, midlevel, and senior GMS officials.5 A learning resource center \n(LRC) was established in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Cambodia Resident Mission to \npromote GMS awareness and knowledge, and an LRC in the ADB Lao Resident Mission \nopened to the public in September 2009. A network of capacity building partners has been \ncreated to support learning program implementation. A GMS research program was launched in \nMarch 2009, and funding for research projects commenced in September 2009. Five issues of \nthe Journal of Greater Mekong Subregion Development Studies have been released, a PPP \nwebsite has been established, and eight volumes of the PPP newsletter, Mekong Leaders, have \nbeen issued. A PPP fellowship program has funded the participation of 31 mid-career GMS civil \nservants to executive development and leadership programs in international institutions. A short, \nhigh-impact  course  on  environment  and  sustainable  development  for  ministers  and  senior \nofficials was conducted in June 2007. A GMS development dialogue (GDD) was conducted on \nenergy security in September 2006, climate change in May 2008, food security in September \n2008, labor migration in May 2009, and the strategic importance of corridor towns in developing \nGMS economic corridors in November 2009. An alumni program called Leaders Networking for \nKnowledge  (LINK)  has  been  established  to  provide  opportunities  for  knowledge  sharing, \ncontinuous networking, expanding professional contacts, and lifelong learning.  \n \n7.  The TA builds on past experiences and lessons from the three previous phases. A PPP \nimpact assessment completed in November 2008 reinforced the PPP\u2019s unique role in creating a \nnew breed of GMS civil servants who will take the lead in pursuing regional cooperation. The \nfindings  of  the  assessment  revealed  that  the  PPP  was  effective  in  providing  high-quality, \ncustomized learning programs for midlevel and senior officials and in implementing innovations \nin building capacity with a range of activities. Further, the management of the project was rated \nefficient  and  effective.  The  focus  on  developing  the  capacity  of  individuals  who  serve  as \ninnovators in their organizations was likewise considered a strength of the PPP. The impact \nassessment  also  cited  issues  and  recommendations  for  improvement,  concluding  that  the \nmonitoring system needs to be significantly strengthened to be able to assess output, outcome, \nand impact results. It also recommended better integration of outputs and activities within the \n                                                 \n4 For the purposes of the TA, \"capacity\" is an all-encompassing term that includes knowledge acquisition, skills \ndevelopment, networking, and developing shared vision and values for the GMS. It is not limited to capability, which \nconnotes skills development. \n5 Learning programs cover, leadership, human resources management, trade policy, regional cooperation and \nintegration, health-care financing, e-governance, social protection, project design, public policy, public management, \npublic\u2013private partnerships, state reforms, education management, tourism management, labor markets, and cross-\nborder infrastructure management, among other topics. ", "  3\nPPP. Other recommendations were to (i) develop a research program; (ii) involve PPP fellows \nand  alumni  in  more  activities;  (iii)  make  better  use  of  the  website  and  other  information \ntechnology platforms; (iv) expand the LRCs; (v) develop learning materials (e.g. case studies) \ncontextualized to the GMS; and (vi) improve the institutional capacity of training institutions to \ndeliver quality programs. These recommendations are reflected in PPP phase IV design. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  the  design  and  implementation  of  effective  and  efficient \nstrategies and projects to promote regional cooperation. Its intended outcome is for GMS civil \nservants to apply the acquired knowledge and skills set in the workplace.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Four outputs are envisaged for the TA with key activities as follows:  \n \n10.  GMS government officials acquire knowledge and develop skills set. In phase IV, \nthe  PPP  will  continue  organizing  learning  programs  to  provide  GMS  policy  makers  and \nmanagers with perspectives, tools, frameworks and key concepts on regional integration and \nleadership, core development sectors, development management, and crosscutting themes.6 \nThese programs will target various echelons of the GMS civil service and aim to enhance their \nskills in developing and implementing functional and strategic development policies, programs, \nand projects. The programs will last 1\u20132 weeks and be designed using the PPP\u2019s proven \nmethodologies of needs assessment, consultation on training needs with GMS governments, \nestablished selection criteria and screening processes, program evaluation and audit, quality \ncontrol,  and  continuous  review  and  improvement.  Moreover,  the  programs  will  be  offered \nthrough the network of PPP capacity-building institutional partners and a pool of experts and \ntrainers. The PPP phase IV will continue to provide fellowship grants to outstanding PPP alumni \nfor nondegree programs lasting 3\u20136 weeks at top-ranked international institutions. The selection \nof  the  fellows  will  use  established  procedures  that  include  faculty  prescreening  based  on \nexceptional performance in PPP learning programs, written applications, and final selection \nfollowing a videoconference with an internal ADB selection committee.  \n \n11.  Knowledge  acquisition,  dissemination,  and  networking  on  GMS  cooperation \nimproved. Short learning events will continue to be organized in the PPP phase IV to promote \nknowledge  acquisition,  dissemination,  and  networking.  This  will  include  GDDs,  which  will \nprovide platforms for in-depth discussion of GMS issues to enhance capacity for policy analysis \nand decision making and identify areas of possible collaboration. The GDDs contribute to \npromoting a better understanding of the benefits and challenges of regional cooperation on \nissues  that  require  collaborative  action.  These  videoconferences  will  be  attended  by  a \nmultisector group of participants from government, the media, think tanks, academe, the private \nsector, and nongovernment and international organizations. In phase IV, PPP LINK alumni \nevents will be organized in five GMS countries to facilitate learning, the exchange and sharing of \nknowledge, and the networking of PPP alumni and fellows.  \n \n                                                 \n6 The proposed topics for the learning programs in the PPP phase IV include leadership, governance, public policy \nand management, regional cooperation and integration, project management, tourism, trade, environment, energy, \nlabor markets, crisis management, poverty reduction, and public\u2013private partnerships. \n ", "4  \n12.  Other activities to be implemented in the PPP phase IV include libraries\u2019 expansion of \ncollections, development of e-databases, and collaboration with other libraries and institutions in \nthe LRCs in Cambodia and the Lao PDR. Both centers are housed in ADB resident missions \nand serve as one-stop information hubs on the GMS, Cambodia, and Lao PDR. They play \ncritical  roles  in  providing  access  to  development  information,  stimulating  thinking  on \ndevelopment issues, and linking knowledge organizations and institutions. A new PPP LRC will \nbe  established  in  Viet  Nam,  where  best  practices  will be  replicated.  The  e-version  of  the \nMekong Leaders PPP newsletter\u2014which features key PPP activities, capacity-building partners, \ninterviews with fellows, and articles on GMS development issues\u2014will be integrated into the \nPPP website and produced annually. The PPP website will be upgraded to improve its reach.  \n \n13.  High-quality  research  on  priority  development  issues  accessible  to  GMS  civil \nservants. The PPP research program launched in phase III will be continued in phase IV. The \nPPP research grants support applied and policy-oriented research that addresses pressing \nregional  and  national  issues  affecting  regional  cooperation  and  integration.7 The  research \noutputs will be conveyed to policy makers through various dissemination channels such as \npolicy briefs and technical papers that will be discussed in GMS meetings and similar events. \nUnder the research program guidelines, GMS institutions are encouraged to collaborate with \none another in research projects to capture multiple country perspectives and broaden the \napplicability of research results, as well as to promote networking. The PPP phase IV will \ncontinue to fund research projects and implement new features in the research program such as \nresearch advising, capacity development, dissemination events, and fellowship grants. In the \nPPP phase IV, two volumes of the Journal for Greater Mekong Subregion Development Studies \nwill be published. This peer-reviewed and multidisciplinary publication seeks to promote better \nunderstanding of GMS development issues and is directed at GMS planners, policy makers, \nacademics,  and  researchers.  To  reach  a  wider  audience,  two  electronic  policy-based \npublications on the GMS will be produced.  \n \n14.  An  effective  project  management  and  performance  monitoring  system \nimplemented.  The  PPP  phase  IV  will  include  the  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem  effectively  used  in  the  first  three  phases  as  well  as  new  systems.  Performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  are  mainly  done  through  the  steering  committee,  which  meets \nregularly. The PPP also uses other mechanisms to monitor progress, assess performance, and \nensure  relevance,  such  as  advisory  board  meetings,  internal  PPP  management  meetings, \nalumni  consultations,  discussions  with  capacity-building  partners  and  teaching  faculty,  and \ndialogues with PPP focal persons in the GMS national secretariats and ADB resident missions.  \n \n15.  Pre- and post-learning program questionnaires will be developed and administered to \nassess the effectiveness of learning programs and the knowledge acquired and skills developed \nby  participating  GMS  civil  servants.  Questionnaires  to  evaluate  PPP  activities  and  gather \nfeedback from participants in the GDDs, alumni attending LINK events, readers of the journal, \nand users of the LRCs, among others, will be developed and distributed and the results reported. \nTracer studies will be conducted with participants and their supervisors on selected learning \nprograms to assess how participating GMS civil servants apply their new knowledge and skills \nin the workplace. A comprehensive evaluation is proposed for 2011. \n \n                                                 \n7 The indicative PPP research topics include trade and trade facilitation, labor mobility, labor migration management, \ninvestment, special border economic zones, food production systems and standards, development of tourism \ncorridors, eco-tourism and community-based tourism, the development of rural renewable energy, and economic \ncorridor development.  ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.4 million equivalent, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). Detailed cost estimates \nand the financing plan are in Appendix 2. As in previous phases, additional funding sources will \nbe actively pursued. Supplemental financing will be used to expand the range and scope of \nactivities under the PPP phase IV.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. A steering committee chaired by the \ndirector  general  of  the  ADB  Southeast  Asia  Department  and  composed  of  GMS  national \ncoordinators and representatives of participating donors will provide guidance for PPP activities \nand policy directions. Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the program will be with \nthe PPP secretariat in the Southeast Asia Department at ADB headquarters. A PPP focal point \nin each GMS country, assigned by respective GMS national secretariats, and point persons in \nthe  ADB  resident  missions  will  provide  logistical  and  administrative  support  to  the  PPP \nsecretariat for the conduct of PPP activities. Learning programs will be conducted through the \nnetwork of institutional partners. An advisory board will provide strategic direction and guidance \non incorporating cutting-edge principles in development management. The board will meet \nannually and have at least four members who have distinguished themselves in various fields in \nthe Asia and Pacific region and can contribute their knowledge to strengthening capacity-\ndevelopment strategies in the region.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented through individually recruited international and national \nconsultants who will work under the supervision of ADB staff responsible for administering the \nTA. It is anticipated that 10 person-months of international consultancy and 120 person-months \nof national consultancy will be required for TA implementation. The learning programs will be \ndelivered through both institutions and the direct hiring of resource persons who will serve as \nfaculty for the learning programs. The consultants and resource persons will be engaged by \nADB in accordance with ADBs\u2019 Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under \nthe  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  ADBs\u2019  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2008,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Although  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nDisbursement Handbook prohibits expenditures for cultural shows and tours, these form part of \nthe learning programs and are integral in the TA. These will be included in the TA expenditures \nprovided these are reasonable in amount and nature.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years commencing in March 2010 and ending in \nMarch  2012.  Office  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). On completion of the TA, all equipment will \nbe retained by the PPP secretariat and used in follow-up programs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,400,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management IV, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nGreater Mekong  By 2015        Regional \nSubregion (GMS)    Government  cooperation is a \ngovernments  five updated or new regional  development reports  priority on the \ndesign and  strategies for GMS agreed and     development agenda \nimplement effective  implemented    of GMS \nand efficient    governments. \nstrategies and  five regional projects   \nprojects to promote  implemented  Risk \nregional  Weak enabling \ncooperation.   environment in GMS \ncountries for policy \nand strategy \nformulation and \nimplementation   \nOutcome  By 31 March 2012    Assumption \nGMS civil servants    Tracer studies   Sustained political \napply acquired  70% of GMS civil servants    commitment, \nknowledge and  participating in the Phnom Penh  Comprehensive  ownership, and \ndeveloped skills  Plan for Development  evaluation report    support of GMS \nsets in the  Management (PPP) activities    governments to the \nworkplace    apply knowledge and skills set in    PPP \nthe workplace.      \n    Risk \n50% of GMS civil servants  Systemic and \nparticipating in PPP activities  institutional \ninvolved in GMS-related  constraints and \nstrategies and projects  restrictive policies \n  hamper GMS civil \nservants\u2019 application \nof acquired \nknowledge and skills. \n \nOutputs   By 31 March 2012    Assumption \n1.
