The Government of Fiji requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to support the update of its 20-year national transport sector plan. There is no \ncurrent country partnership strategy or country operations business plan for Fiji, although the TA \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s re-engagement strategy and the Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014. ADB \nfielded a fact-finding mission on 19\u201325 September 2013 and agreed with the government on the \nTA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework appears in Appendix \n1.1 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In Fiji, the transport sector consists of land, maritime, and aviation subsectors, which are \nimportant in supporting Fiji\u2019s economy and its vibrant tourism sector, through the movement of \npeople and goods. Fiji is an archipelagic nation of more than 332 islands, of which 110 are \ninhabited, and more than 500 uninhabited islets. Its land area of 18,300 square kilometers is \nspread over a sea area of 194,000 square kilometers. Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, the two main \nislands, are home to about 90% of the population of 860,000; 48% of the people live in rural \nareas.2 \n \n3.  Fiji  requires  adequate  transport  infrastructure  to  improve  access  to  economic \nopportunities  for  rural  populations  and  to  improve  trade.  The  transport,  storage,  and \ncommunication  sector  contributed  an  estimated  12%\u201315%  to the  country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct between 1995 and 2011. Transport is therefore critical to sustain economic growth over \nthe medium to long term. Between 2003 and 2009, average household income in rural areas \ndeclined by 14%, and the incidence of poverty in rural areas increased from 40% to 43%. \nMoreover, the pace of economic activities in rural areas has worsened, as indicated by large \ndeclines in loans to agriculture and especially sugarcane businesses.3 In a 2013 survey, Fiji \nranked 111 of 185 economies in the ease of trading across its borders, a measure of the time \nand cost associated with the import or export of a standard shipment by sea transport.4 The \nsurvey results showed that local transportation and handling accounted for 30% of costs and \nabout  12%  of  time  associated  with  imports  and  exports.  Improving  the  national  transport \nnetwork will reduce cost and time and facilitate trade. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s  transport  strategy  for  the  Pacific  island  countries,  articulated  in  the  Pacific \nApproach, has focused on improving multimodal, integrated network connectivity for access to \nsocial services and to domestic and international markets. Fiji\u2019s dispersed geography makes \nintermodal links vital to connect people and goods\u2014through the road links to the main ports of \nSuva (the capital) and Lautoka, and to the landing points of the interisland domestic shipping \nand ferry services between Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Ovalau, and Taveuni. There are also modal \noptions for transporting freight between northwest and southeast Viti Levu, either shipping \nbetween Lautoka and Suva ports or hauling by land along Queens Road. The international \nairport in Nadi is connected to the capital by Queens Road and by domestic flights to and from \nNausori airport. Roads to these airports are also essential intermodal links. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2013. \n2  United Nations Statistics Division. http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=Fiji. \n3  Fiji Island Bureau of Statistics.

The institutional structure in the transport sector is fragmented. The Fiji Road Authority \n(FRA) reports to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and is tasked with managing the country\u2019s road \nassets, bridges, wharves, and jetties, except  in international ports. The Ministry of Works, \nTransport, and Public Utilities (MWTPU) formulates and implements the land transport policy, \nwhile the Land Transport Authority (LTA) enforces road transport regulations and addresses \nroad user issues. The Fiji Ports Corporation Limited is responsible for the main international \nports; the MWTPU formulates maritime policy; and the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) \naddresses regulatory issues for maritime transport. A more coherent and overarching transport \nsector policy and national transport plan are needed to coordinate a common strategy for all \nstakeholders. \n \n6.  Fiji\u2019s public road network contains about 11,000 kilometers of roads, of which about 13% \nare sealed, and about 900 bridges. A 2007 survey of road condition and maintenance needs in \nthe network showed an increasing backlog in maintenance. At the time, the backlog in remedial \nand preventive maintenance for the road network, excluding bridges, was estimated at about \n$215 million equivalent. There are also indications that efficient implementation will be hindered \nby chronic issues in the transport sector such as poor performance by international contractors, \nunavailability or lack of capacity to produce basic construction materials, and regular disruption \nby the wet climate. \n \n7.  The road transport sector also confronts user issues. Overloaded logging and sugarcane \ntrucks are common, damaging the road network and exacerbating the backlog of maintenance. \nThere is little monitoring of axle weights. Poorly maintained vehicles emitting black smoke are \ncommon, and initiatives are under way to reduce emissions. Traffic congestion during peak \nperiods  is  significant,  with  the  Suva  to  Nausori  corridor  identified  as  requiring  traffic \nmanagement and an alternative coastal route. Within Suva, urban roads are congested and the \nextensive use of one-way traffic control is increasing vehicle travel. The LTA, established in \n1998, enforces road transport regulations designed to mitigate these issues. \n \n8.  Domestic maritime transport is the main mode of transportation between many islands \nand communities, and service efficiency, reliability, and affordability  are essential to trade, \ntourism,  and  socioeconomic  opportunities.  A  condition  survey  is  needed  to  ascertain  the \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation  needs  of  the  rural  maritime  infrastructure  inventory,  which \nconsists of about 50 wharves and jetties.  \n \n9.  The transport sector strategy is articulated through the 20-year Fiji National Transport \nSector Plan (FNTSP) 1993, which needs a comprehensive review. The FNTSP is a guiding \ndocument for transport policy, institutional development, and infrastructure investment, covering \nall transport and intermodal issues. It covers (i) the three main airports of Nadi, Nausori, Labasa, \nand smaller domestic airports; (ii) international air services through Nadi and Nausori, and \ndomestic air services; (iii) main ports of entry and international shipping; (iv) small wharves and \njetties, and domestic shipping services to outer islands; and (v) national, municipal, and other \npublic roads, and road transport services.  \n \n10.  In 2004, a review and policy update of the FNTSP produced a revised overview of the \nsector, guiding objectives and policy principles, broad physical and operational descriptions, and \ninstitutional arrangements and factors shaping the sector. It emphasized policy development \nand implementation, with separate policy action plans for each modal subsector. However, a \ncomprehensive update of the FNTSP is required, covering the national road and rural maritime \ninfrastructure  and  associated  intermodal  links.  It  should  streamline  agency  plans  for  each \nsubsector to articulate the national strategy over the next 20 years. \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n11.  The  TA  will  support  the  government  in  formulating  its  land  and  maritime  transport \npolicies, and updating its 20-year FNTSP, covering the land and maritime transport subsectors \nand intermodal links. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  of the  TA will  be  more  efficient, safe,  and  effective  land  and maritime \ntransport infrastructure. The outcome will be approved national transport sector policies and \nplans. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  To achieve the outcome, the TA will deliver the following outputs. \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Transport  sector  assessment  and  road  map.  An  assessment  of \nexisting policy and a road map for future policy direction will be undertaken. It will \ncover  the  land  and  maritime  transport  subsectors  and  intermodal  links,  with \nconsideration  of  cost  recovery;  asset  management;  land  and  maritime  transport \nsafety;  universal  access  considerations;  disaster  resilience;  and  climate  change \nadaptation measures for infrastructure standards, guidelines, and asset management \nprinciples. \n \n(ii) Output 2: 20-year investment plan. A 20-year investment plan will be developed \nfor land and maritime transport infrastructure and intermodal links. A multi-criteria \nframework will prioritize capital investments, upgrading, and recurrent maintenance \ncosts for the national road network and maritime infrastructure. The framework will \nconsider economic and financial viability, and government priorities for projects. The \ninvestment plan will take into account the synergy between (i) maritime safety, land \nuse on ship-to-shore interfaces, transport planning, universal access, and climate \nchange adaptation and disaster resilience for the maritime transport subsector; and \n(ii) road safety, land use, transport planning, universal access, and climate change \nadaptation for the land transport subsector. The investment plan will be supported by \nfunding strategies to ensure a sustainable transport network. \n \n14.  To achieve output 1, reviews will be done on the existing 1993 FNTSP; the 2004 partial \nupdate; the 2009 draft land transport update; the FRA\u2019s 10-year investment plan; the MSAF\u2019s \n10-year investment plan; and other relevant transport policies, plans, and strategies. The TA \nconsultants  will  consult  with  government,  survey  users  and  the  public  on  infrastructure \nperceptions  and  needs,  and  analyze  the  performance  of  the  land  and  maritime  transport \nsubsectors. Drawing on the sector assessments, recommendations for future policy direction \nwill be prepared. \n \n15.  To achieve output 2, the TA consultants will establish the condition inventory of transport \ninfrastructure  with  support  from  the  FRA\u2019s  asset  management  system  and  develop  the \nframework for project selection. Based on the condition survey and framework analysis, a 20-\nyear investment plan for new capital investment, upgrading, and recurrent maintenance will be \ndeveloped in consultation with the government for the land and maritime transport subsectors. \nThe plan will integrate the FRA, LTA, and MSAF 10-year investment plans. An investment \nproject for potential development partner financing will be identified and prepared, tentatively \n ", "4   \ncomprising part of a national bridge replacement or repair program. The government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan appears in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency,  responsible  for  the  overall \nadministration of the TA. The MWTPU will be the implementing agency responsible for the \noversight of the consultants. \n  \n18.  The TA will require consulting services consisting of 20 international person-months and \n9  national  person-months  of  specialist  inputs.  A  consulting  firm  will  provide  the  following \ninternational experts: team leader and transport planner-economist (7 person-months), maritime \ntransport specialist (2 person-months), civil engineer (4 person-months), asset management \nspecialist  (2  person-months),  financial  management  specialist  (3  person-months), \nenvironmental safeguards specialist (1 person-month), and social and poverty specialist (1 \nperson-month), as well as a national deputy team leader and transport planner (9 person-\nmonths). ADB will select the consultant firm using quality- and cost-based selection (with the \nstandard  quality  to  cost  ratio  of  80:20)  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference appear in \nAppendix 3. Disbursement will follow direct payment procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period from approval to completion. ADB \nwill  field  an  inception  mission,  regular  review  missions,  a  midterm  review  mission,  and  a \nfinalization  mission.  ADB  will  liaise  closely  with  government  agencies  and  attend  key \nstakeholder workshops at inception, midterm, and completion. A committee chaired by the \nMWTPU with members from the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Strategic Planning, National \nDevelopment, and Statistics; the Ministry of Industry and Trade; the FRA; the LTA; the MSAF; \nand ADB will closely monitor progress against schedules agreed at inception and evaluate the \nconsultants\u2019 performance against the agreed draft and final deliverables.  \n \nIV.
