INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for policy \nand advisory technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Strategic Master Plan for Chittagong Port. \nADB approved the TA concept paper on 8 July 2011. In April 2011, an ADB fact-finding mission \nheld discussions with the Ministry of Shipping, the Chittagong Port Authority, and the Economic \nRelations  Division  of the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  prepare  the TA. The  mission  reached  an \nunderstanding with the government on the TA project's impact, outcome, scope, implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Chittagong Port is the principal seaport of Bangladesh and handles about 92% of the \ncountry's import\u2013export trade. As such its importance to the national economy is paramount. In \nthe fiscal year (FY) 2009/10, Chittagong Port handled about 30.5 million tons of cargo and about \n1.21 million 20-foot equivalent container units. The annual growth rate for 20-foot equivalent \ncontainer units handled has been 9.4% in the FY 2009/10. Inefficient port operations and \ninadequate  intermodal  connectivity  are  principal  issues  in  Bangladesh's  transport  sector. \nInefficient  port  operations  result  in  congestion  in  cargo  handling  and  clearance.  Weak \nintermodal connectivity results in prolonged waiting time and occupies space for exchanging \ncargoes, and higher overall transport costs due to limited availability of transportation modes, \nwhich discourages potential economic activities and external trade. \n \n3.  Chittagong Port is a river port situated mainly on the northern bank of Karnaphuli River \nabout 16 kilometers (km) upstream from the Bay of Bengal. The width, curvature, and draft of \nthe river limit the size of vessels able to call at Chittagong Port, and increasing siltation in recent \nyears is threatening to limit further the growth in transport through Chittagong Port. The port is in \nthe south of the city of Chittagong, the second largest city in Bangladesh and about 250 km \nsoutheast of Dhaka, the nation\u2019s capital and administrative and economic center.  \n \n4.  Chittagong Port will increase its container-handling capacity in coming years, once the \nnew mooring container terminal is fully operational. The terminal is located directly west of the \nexisting facilities of Chittagong Container Terminal and will be managed by a private operator \nunder a public\u2013private partnership scheme. Expansion of the port on the northern bank of \nKarnaphuli River is constrained by the city; in particular, road and rail traffic bound for the port \nhas to pass through the city of Chittagong. Land for port expansion is available on the southern \nbank of Karnaphuli River, but connectivity to these areas is poor and the consequences of \ndeveloping port facilities on siltation need to be studied. \n \n5.  Dhaka and Chittagong are linked by air, inland waterways, roads, and railway. Road and \nrailway traffic between Dhaka and Chittagong Port is facing serious capacity bottlenecks. The \n327 km railway between Dhaka and Chittagong is partially a single-track line, which limits the \nnumber  of  daily  trains.  Due to the  preference given  to  passenger transportation,  only  4-5 \ncontainer trains per day are operating between Dhaka and Chittagong, carrying around 10% of \nthe containers to and from Chittagong Port. The railway capacity will improve in 3-5 years, when \nmost of the single-track sections have been converted into double track. These projects are \nfinanced by ADB, India, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Once the upgrade of \nthe Dhaka\u2013Chittagong railway is completed, establishing an integrated multimodal transport \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 August 2011. \n ", "2   \nchain between Dhaka and Chittagong Port is essential, including inland container depots for \ntransshipment of containers between road feeder transport, railway, and port.  \n \n6.  The road traffic between Dhaka and Chittagong is hampered by the lack of capacity of \nthe 250 km highway and by load restrictions on bridges. In general, fully loaded containers \ncannot be transported to Dhaka by road, so loading and unloading of containers takes place in \nChittagong Port. Widening of the two-lane highway between Dhaka and Chittagong to four lanes \nis ongoing, and the government plans to realize an expressway between Dhaka and Chittagong \nunder a private\u2013public partnership. Once these improvements for road transport to Chittagong \nPort  are  realized,  the  port  will  need  upgraded  facilities  with  more  capacity  to  handle  the \nadditional traffic and to store containers. \n \n7.  Inland waterways are used to transport bulk and general cargo to Chittagong Port. It is \nplanned to use inland waterways also for container transport between Dhaka and Chittagong \nPort, and a river port to handle containers near Dhaka is under construction.  \n \n8.  Air transport between Dhaka and Chittagong caters mainly to passenger transport. The \nnumber of flights is limited and flights are not used for hinterland transport to Chittagong Port. \n \n9.  Recent high-level intergovernmental consultations and agreements will allow improved \naccess  for  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal  to  Chittagong  Port.  This  additional  traffic  has  to  be \nconsidered when designing new facilities at Chittagong Port, as this will not only create more \ntraffic, but will also require additional port facilities to cater for transit traffic. \n \n10.  Supporting  the  development  of  Chittagong  Port  and  improving  integrated  landside \nhinterland transport to reduce trade logistic costs for transport services are key objectives of the \ntransport  policies  outlined  in  the  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015).  The \ngovernment further recognized the importance of integrated intermodal systems under the draft \nIntegrated Multimodal Transport Policy. Port development provides significant opportunities for \nimprovement of intermodal transport systems and logistics services, hence boosting efficiency \nof economic activities. Port development also provides opportunities for expansion of regional \ntrade with Bhutan, India, and Nepal.  \n \n11.  All previous development plans for Chittagong Port are outdated (the latest Chittagong \nPort master plan covers the period 1995\u20132010) and do not consider the recent upgrades of \nmaritime and landside infrastructure, and improvements in port efficiency, e.g., through the \nrecently introduced container terminal management system or the opening of Chittagong Port to \ntransit traffic. Apart from coping with rising demand, there is an urgent need for expansion of \nport facilities to cope with rising demand and provide specialized facilities for bulk cargo; private \ninvestors are approaching Chittagong Port Authority for permission to develop new port facilities \nsuch as jetties, new port basins, and warehouses.  \n \n12.  To address these ongoing and anticipated developments in demand for and in access to \nthe port, and to ensure continuous sustainable growth for Bangladesh\u2019s economy, a new master \nplan for strategic development of Chittagong Port shall be prepared, providing a long-term vision \nfor the development of the port with a planning horizon of 25-30 years. Improving the overall \ncapacity of Chittagong Port will help to maintain sustainable economic growth in Bangladesh by \nensuring access to international markets. This has a direct impact on poverty reduction in \nBangladesh by providing employment opportunities during design, construction, and operation \nand maintenance of the port facilities, in activities related to trade and trade facilitation, in the \ntransport sector, and in export-oriented industrial production. ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be improved efficiency of port operations and intermodal \ntransport  logistics  to  support  sustainable  economic  growth  in  Bangladesh,  and  regional \nconnectivity for landlocked Bhutan and Nepal, and the northeastern states of India.   \n \n14.  The outcome of the TA will be an agreed overall framework for port development under \npossible development scenarios and will support the integrated intermodal port development on \nboth the maritime and land side of the port based on an updated traffic forecast.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will support preparation of a strategic port master plan\u2014including (i) preparation \nof a comprehensive traffic and development forecast for Chittagong Port in different scenarios \nbased on the anticipated social and economic development for Bangladesh; trade with third \ncountries and the expected demand for transit to Bhutan, India, and Nepal; (ii) assessment of \nthe  port's  infrastructure  and  intermodal  connectivity  with  the  road  and  rail  network  linking \nChittagong Port to major sources of demand in Bangladesh and the region; (iii) assessment of \nthe hydraulic conditions in Karnaphuli River to propose sustainable port development; and \n(iv) updating of the overall port development framework for Chittagong Port development based \non recent infrastructure development and the traffic forecasts prepared under item (i)\u2014and \nrecommend integrated multimodal maritime and landside development scenarios for sustainable \ndevelopment of the port as the major regional and international trade gateway for Bangladesh \nand the northeastern South Asia region. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The Government has requested ADB to finance  $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, support \nfacilities, counterpart staff, maps, reports, and other logistical support and will finance a detailed \nhydraulic, hydrological, and geo-morphological study on Karnaphuli River. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The executing agency is the Ministry of Shipping, which will chair a steering committee \nto provide overall guidance on TA delivery. The implementing agency is the Chittagong Port \nAuthority, which will be the major point of contact for the TA consultants and will interact with \nthem on a day-to-day basis.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from May 2012 to December 2014. Consulting services will \nbe carried out over a period of 24 months by a firm of consultants comprising experts in \ntransport  planning,  transport  policy  and  institutions,  transport  economics,  ports  and  river \nhydraulics,  dredging,  traffic  engineering  and  modeling,  information  technology  systems, \ncustoms and trade facilitation, roads and railway transport, multimodal transport, land and aerial \nsurveying, ports and river engineering, and coastal morphology. About 27 person-months of \ninternational consulting and about 32 person-months of national consulting will be provided. \nADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n ", "4   \n(2010, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection with a quality-\ncost ratio of 90:10. This quality-cost ratio is proposed in light of the high complexity of the scope \nof works, which requires specialized inputs from qualified consultants with experience in the \nfields of maritime design and transport, traffic forecasting and traffic modeling, and multimodal \ntransport; and the services have to be carried out in a mixed team of international and national \nconsultants within a tight timeframe. The consultants will submit simplified technical proposals. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  All equipment for the TA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time) and transferred to the government upon TA completion. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  The  consultants  will  submit  (i)  an  inception  report  within  4  weeks  of  starting  their \nservices, detailing the initial work program and the terms of reference for the detailed hydraulic \nand hydrologic study for Karnaphuli River; (ii) two interim reports 6 and 12 months after starting \ntheir services, including the overall development framework for Chittagong Port development; \n(iii) the draft final report after 21 months of services; and (iv) the final report on TA completion, \nincorporating comments by the government and ADB, to be completed 2 weeks after receipt of \nthe comments. The consultants will also submit monthly progress reports with a summary of \nactivities and recommendations for action on issues. \n \n21.  Two national workshops will be conducted during TA implementation. The first, with all \nrelevant stakeholders involved in business with and trade through Chittagong Port, will discuss \nthe objective, approach, and methodology to establish the master plan for Chittagong Port and \ncollect inputs from these stakeholders. The first workshop shall be held within 1-2 months from \nthe start of consulting services. The second workshop will discuss TA outputs for finalization \nafter submission of the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.
