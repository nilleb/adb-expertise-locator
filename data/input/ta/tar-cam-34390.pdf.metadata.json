During  the  2002  Country  Strategy  and  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of \nCambodia requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprepare  a  feasibility  study  of  rehabilitating  and  expanding  distribution  facilities  in  selected \nprovincial towns1 and constructing a high-voltage transmission line. The TA was included in the \n2003 Country Strategy  Program Update.2 To enhance efficient power supply in the Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS),  six  countries  signed  an  Inter-Governmental  Agreement  on  3 \nNovember  2002.  A  regional  master  plan  on  power  interconnection  in  the  GMS  outlining \ntransmission links between the region\u2019s present and expected future generating facilities has \nbeen developed.3 Under this plan a transmission link between Phnom Penh and Chau Doc \nsubstation in southwest Viet Nam is identified for implementation at the earliest possible date. A \npower purchase agreement was signed by Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC) and Electricity of \nViet Nam (EVN) on 24 July 2000. The Government of Cambodia has requested ADB to provide \na loan to cofinance with the World Bank the Cambodia Rural Electrification and Transmission \nProject.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Responsibility for coordinating the Government\u2019s electricity sector policy and planning \nrests with the Energy General Directorate of the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME). \nBy a royal decree in 1996, EDC was established as a limited liability company owned jointly by \nMIME and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Before 1996, EDC operated as a government \ndepartment under the direction of MIME. Its 1996 charter gives EDC the nonexclusive right to \ngenerate,  transmit,  and  distribute  electricity  throughout  Cambodia.  Although  EDC  formally \noperates  as  a  separate  entity,  the  Government  continues  to  have  an  unofficial  role  and \nsometimes adverse effect on EDC\u2019s performance. MIME owns and operates some of the \nsystems in the urban areas that are not under EDC\u2019s control. \n \n3.  With the promulgation of the Electricity Law (2001), the Government further clarified and \nseparated its role as policy maker, owner, regulator and also customer of EDC. In September \n2001, the Electric Authority of Cambodia (EAC) was established as the independent regulator of \nelectricity  supply.  While  EAC  has  issued  licenses  to  EDC  and  large  private  providers  of \nelectricity, its tasks and workload currently exceed its resources. The World Bank has provided \nsome technical assistance under its previous loan, but EAC may require additional support to \nprepare and issue the guidelines and rules (especially in the area of tariff setting) before it \nbecomes fully functional as the regulator.  In addition, it is unclear whether EAC in its current \ncapacity can license and effectively monitor the large number of small private sector operators. \n \n4.  Ravaged by 20 years of civil war and neglect, the power system of Cambodia has been \nunable to supply the demand for electricity by conventional grid connections. Isolated power \ngrids are supplied mostly by small and medium-size diesel generators and operated by private \n                                                 \n1  In addition to the eight towns currently being rehabilitated under ADB. 2000.

Cambodia\u2019s electricity supply at present comprises at least 22 licensed small \nisolated systems and numerous other ones, which are not licensed.  \n \n5.  With  13%  of  households  and  only  7%  of  rural  households  electrified,  Cambodia\u2019s \nelectrification ratio is among the lowest in Asia. The power sector is highly inequitable, with an \nelectrification ratio of 65% in Phnom Penh and 27% in other towns, which have a considerably \nhigher poverty incidence. Consumption patterns are also skewed, with per capita consumption \nrates  ranging  from  328  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  month  in  Phnom  Penh  to  \n9  kWh  per  month  in  provincial  areas.  These  inequities  have  strong  implications  for  the \ndistribution of economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n6.  Electricity demand continues to grow at approximately 10\u201312% per annum, with most of \nthis growth expected in the Phnom Penh area. The challenge for EDC is to continue to develop \n(or facilitate development of) new sources of power generation, improve operations of the \nexisting systems, and reduce the average purchase cost of generation. The challenge for the \nGovernment, given its limited financial resources, is to improve and efficiently expand electricity \nsupply throughout the country.  \n \n7.  With the steep tariff increases in 1999, many customers in Phnom Penh opted for  \nself-generation instead of the EDC supply. EDC must provide more competitive tariffs and \nincrease reliability to attract these customers back and to facilitate industrial and commercial \ndevelopment in Cambodia. With generation options limited in the short term to additional \nindependent power producer contracts, the Government has decided to pursue interconnection \nwith Thailand (80 megawatts [MW]) to serve western load centers and interconnection with Viet \nNam (200 MW) to serve Phnom Penh and the southeastern towns. Once these connections are \nmade, the average cost of generation will be significantly reduced, leading to affordable and \ncompetitive tariffs. Such beneficial tariff restructuring will still allow EDC to improve its financial \nperformance and ability to finance capital expenditures.5 These power interconnections will also \npromote subregional cooperation in utility planning as part of the overall GMS strategy in the \nMekong basin. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will prepare/update feasibility studies designed to facilitate international power \ntransfers and stimulate equitable economic growth across the country to promote sustainable \npoverty reduction. The outputs will be reports that (i) update the feasibility study6 of a 220 \nkilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  from  the  Vietnamese  border  to  Phnom  Penh,  including \nsubstations at Takeo and West Phnom Penh; (ii) assess the feasibility of providing the villages \nalong  the  route  with  low-voltage  electricity;  (iii)  assess  the  feasibility of rehabilitating and \nexpanding the generation and distribution systems in selected7 provincial towns; (iv) assess the \ntraining needs of EDC staff with respect to management, operation and maintenance of high-\nvoltage systems and provincial grids; and (v) prepare terms of reference (TORs) for the project \nimplementation consultants to review/update prefeasibility studies of small hydroelectric projects \nand to prepare bidding documents for build-own-operate-transfer  implementation, and to assist \n                                                 \n5  More specifically, long-term base load generation options at Sihanoukville and Kamchay. \n6  Feasibility Study for the First Transmission Link between Phnom Penh and the Southern Region of Cambodia in 6 \nvolumes, April 2001, prepared for the World Bank\u2019s proposed Rural Electrification and Transmission Project. \n7  Selection criteria will consider economic growth potential, impacts on poverty, and equitable distribution of social \nbenefits. ", "    3 \nwith bidding and evaluation. The TA will incorporate the findings of the current study8 into \nappropriate models for private sector participation in the refurbished electricity systems in the \nprovincial towns and evaluate the capacity of EAC to properly license private sector operations \nin a timely and effective manner. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be in two parts. Part 1 will assess the transmission component and Part 2 \nwill study a set of subprojects under a generation/distribution component. The report on part 1 \nhave a strict deadline within 4.5 months of the appointment of the consultants, and the report on \npart 2 after a further 7 months. Key activities cover six major areas: (i) review of the capacity of \nthe electricity regulator to license private sector operators in the provincial towns; (ii) compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies;  (iii)  identification  of  project  areas  under  the  distribution \ncomponent;  (iv)  economic  and  financial  evaluations  of  the  transmission  and \ngeneration/distribution components; (v) linkage between economic growth, electricity supply and \npoverty reduction, including affordability to the poor; and (vi) technical project design. \n \n10.  The consultants will review and update the previous studies relating to a transmission \nlink between Phnom Penh and the Vietnamese border and other proposed transmission lines in \nthe southern region of Cambodia. The outline design (footnote 6) including route, substation \nfacilities, technical specifications, etc. will be adopted to the extent possible. The consultants will \ninvestigate  the  feasibility  of  supplying  electricity  to  people  living  along  the  route  of  the \ntransmission line. Conventional methods of supply will be compared to \u201cshieldwire distribution\u201d \nand \u201csingle-wire-earth-return\u201d techniques and the most appropriate system to implement will be \nrecommended.  \n \n11.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies for the environment and involuntary \nresettlement,  field  surveys  will  be  made  to  confirm  environmental  impacts,  to  update  the \nresettlement plan (footnote 6), and to prepare a full inventory of all affected land and project \nhouseholds  for  the  distribution  component.  Necessary  mitigation  measures,  most  suitable \nimplementation arrangements, and costing of the mitigation measures will also be prepared. A \nfull resettlement plan will be prepared since the temporary and permanent loss of productive \nmeans for affected persons could be significant. The project\u2019s impacts are not expected to \ncause any cultural or socially specific impact, or exclude any socioeconomic group, including \nindigenous  people,  from  benefiting  from  the  proposed  investment  project.  Therefore,  no \nindigenous peoples\u2019 plan is required. The summary initial social and poverty analysis is in \nAppendix 1. Planning for the transmission component of the Project (footnote 6), particularly \nroute selection, has sought to minimize environmental impacts and is consistent with technical \nand economic objectives. Other effects will be minimized as far as practicable and economical, \nand compensation measures provided where impacts cannot be mitigated. Experience gained \nwith implementing Loan 1794-CAM (footnote 1) indicates that social and environmental impacts \nfor the generating and distribution components will be minor. The project has been classified as \nenvironmental category B. An initial environmental examination (IEE) report and its summary \n(SIEE) will be prepared in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of ADB and the \nGovernment of Cambodia.  \n \n12.  The economic analysis will review and update the feasibility study (footnote 6) for the \ntransmission component. In addition, it will evaluate the feasibility of supplying electricity to \n                                                 \n8  Staff  Consultant\u2019s  Report:  Financial  Advisory  Review  of  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Electtricity  Supply, \nDecember 2002.  \n ", "4    \nhouseholds along the transmission route. Such provision will benefit households that otherwise \nmay not benefit from the project but may be adversely affected by the construction of the \ntransmission line. An economic evaluation will also be conducted for the feasibility of each \nsubproject under the distribution component. \n \n13.  To analyze the way in which the proposed investment project is linked to poverty \nreduction, a detailed poverty analysis will use existing studies and data combined with field \nconsultations. Particular attention will be paid to the affordability of upfront connection charges \nand monthly bills. \n \n14.  Before fielding of the consultants for part 2, EDC will prepare preliminary cost estimates \nof the necessary rehabilitation works, together with preliminary forecasts of load growth for the \nlong list of Government-nominated towns (Appendix 2). The consultants will make an initial \nassessment  of  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  generation  and/or \ndistribution rehabilitation projects on the long list and prioritize the subprojects. The towns for \ninclusion in the TA will be selected at the first tripartite meeting. For each selected town, the \nconsultants will carry out a detailed physical and socioeconomic survey and produce load \nforecasts, preliminary layouts, and cost estimates of the works to rehabilitate the generation \nand/or distribution systems.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $910,000 equivalent comprising $658,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $252,000  in  local  currency  equivalent.  ADB  will provide $730,000 \nequivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost plus $72,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will initially be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe Government has agreed to finance $180,000 for office accommodation, counterpart staff, \noffice supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare given in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance the ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.   MIME has designated EDC as the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA.  EDC has been \nthe EA for two previous ADB loans9 and loans for similar works from other lenders. The \nexecutive director of the Corporate Planning and Projects Department of EDC will have overall \nresponsibility for EDC\u2019s contribution to the TA, and will set up a unit suitably staffed with \ncounterpart  personnel  for  day-to-day  coordination  and  to  work  with  the  TA  consultants\u2019 \npersonnel and other stakeholders, particularly the local governments of Phnom Penh, Kandal, \nand Takeo. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented for 12 months starting in February 2003 and will require \nabout 33 person-months of consulting services: 23 international and 10 domestic. The outline \nTOR for the international consultants are in Appendix 4. Tripartite meetings will be held after the \nreceipt of the inception, interim and draft final reports. \n \n18.  Early implementation of the transmission link is essential for the financial well-being of \nEDC, and important to meet the country\u2019s economic growth targets. The loan has therefore \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1994.

Consulting services relating to the transmission link \ncomponent of the loan (which represents about 75% of the loan amount) will consist of updating \nan existing feasibility study (footnote 6). The consulting firms that successfully undertook that \nstudy are the most qualified to undertake the update efficiently and effectively, and will therefore \nbe  engaged  by  direct  selection  methods  (ref.  PAI  2.04,  para.  10).  ADB  will  engage  the  \nconsulting  firms  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consultants will \nprocure equipment to be financed under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $730,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia for preparing the Power Distribution and Greater Mekong Subregion Transmission \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. The technical assistance, initially financed \nas a grant, will be subject to the reimbursement arrangements set forth in Technical Assistance \nOperations (ADB, R51-77, 20 May 1997) and Streamlining of Technical Assistance Operations \n(ADB, R44-88, 21 March 1988). If the technical assistance results in an ADB loan, ADB may \ncharge against the loan, and recover from it, the portion of the initial grant that exceeds \n$250,000 equivalent. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national    Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes  \nPriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty partnership agreement? \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nCambodia\u2019s power sector was severely damaged by years of civil war and neglect. The sector is very small \nand is in the early stages of development. The main organized electricity supply system comprises 23 small isolated \nnetworks, of which 14 are public and 9 private. The networks serve the main capital towns in the provinces and \nPhnom Penh, which has by far the largest system.  \n \nThe power sector in Cambodia is highly inequitable and the electrification ratio is among the lowest in Asia. \nLess than 13% of households and only 7% of rural household have access to electricity. Consumption patterns are \nalso skewed in favor of non-poor with per capita consumption rates ranging from 328 kilowatt-hours (kWh)/month in \nPhnom Penh, where poverty incidence is 11%, to 9 kWh/month in other urban towns, where poverty is considerably \nhigher, 30%. Inequities in the connection ratios and power consumption patterns have strong implications for the \ndistribution of economic growth. \n  \nMost provincial supply systems are in a severe state of disrepair and environmentally hazardous. Voltage \ndrops are excessive. Voltage fluctuations destroy electrical appliances and reduce incentives to invest further in \nappliances for productive purposes. With unreliable supply that operates for only a few hours a day, consumers \ndiversify energy sources with consequent costs. For the poor quality of supply, consumers pay the highest tariffs in \nSoutheast Asia, ranging from about $0.22 to $0.51 per kWh. While willingness to pay for electricity is high, even \namong the poor who face high costs for alternative but deficient energy sources such as kerosene,1 high tariffs \nreduce the ability to use electricity for purposes beyond basic lighting. Moreover, the quality of supply usually drops \nduring peak hours, the time during which the poor use electricity for lighting. Thus, despite potential large impacts, \nthere is little incentive for the poor to connect even if the electricity grid was available. \n \nThe tariff levels are largely determined by the cost of generation, losses, and number of consumers \n(economies of scale). Tariff levels tend to be higher for towns situated in provinces with higher incidence of poverty.  \nGiven the Government\u2019s limited fiscal capacity and the low access to electrification among the poor, subsidized tariffs \nwould incur high opportunity costs and would be poorly targeted. The solution to providing affordable and reliable \nelectricity is to promote employment opportunities in urban areas outside Phnom Penh. For equitable economic \ngrowth and to directly target the urban poor, tariffs will be reduced by reducing the cost of generation and reducing \nlosses. Sufficient and affordable power is key to promoting commercial and industrial activities to provide for off-farm \nemployment opportunities in provincial towns and reduce migration to Phnom Penh. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification:  \nBeneficiary non-specific intervention \nThematic Classification:  \n              Economic growth  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty analysis will make use of existing surveys and provincial data combined with consultations in the \nfield, and will include a poverty profile for project areas and an assessment on three levels: (i) direct, (ii) indirect, and \n(iii) macroeconomic impacts. Mechanisms through which the poverty and vulnerability of the near poor are reduced \nwill be identified and assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. The type and extent of effects and the mechanisms \nthrough which they take place, together with key assumptions and risks, will be summarized in a matrix to give an \noverview  of  the  distributional  impacts  across  key  socioeconomic  groups.  Poverty  analysis  will  comprise  an \nassessment of the transmission project, with shield wiring, as the direct poverty targeting component, and an \nassessment of the impacts of the distribution project on existing and new consumers. The analysis will also determine \n                                                 \n1  The cost of 1 kWh using kerosene is approximately $0.73 in provincial towns. ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nassessment of the impacts of the distribution project on existing and new consumers. The analysis will also determine \nthe affordability of connection costs and other up-front charges2 and tariffs.    \n \nDirect Effects on Poverty:  \n \nThe analysis will establish a poverty profile, examine the impacts of direct access to electricity, and assess \nthe affordability of up-front charges and tariffs. The study will be based on a review of existing data and studies, \ncomplemented by consultations with consumers in the proposed project areas.   \n \nIndirect Effects on Poverty: \n \nThe study will include a review of the impact on development aspects, interlinking the project effects of \nincreased power supply with sectoral growth patterns and employment on poverty in the identified target provinces. It \nwill make use of provincial data, sectoral data, and socioeconomic surveys. It will examine the impact potential of \nsectoral growth patterns, absorption of unskilled versus skilled labor, and implications for income and income source \ndiversification for households across socioeconomic groups. It will particularly pay attention to sectoral shifts in \nproduction activities, agricultural productivity, the ability of the poor to benefit from job opportunities, the unskilled \nlabor intensity of job opportunities, migration, and the sustainability of poverty reduction effects.  \n \nMacroeconomic Effects on Poverty: \n \nThe study of the macroeconomic effects will focus on the impact of the project on power consumption \npatterns,  on  the  type  of  economic  growth  that  the  proposed  project  supports,  its  effects  on  geographic \nincome/expenditure disparities, and the sustainability of poverty reduction. It will include an analysis of the constraints \nthat specific groups of the poor and vulnerable may face in benefiting from economic growth. The analysis will be \nbased on geographic growth patterns across sectors and other relevant key macroeconomic variables over time, \ncombined with poverty and social indicators derived from socioeconomic surveys. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis:  \n \n  A stakeholder analysis will be an integral part of the economic (distributional assessment), poverty, and \nresettlement assessments. The stakeholder analysis under the economic and poverty assessments will be mainly \ndescriptive and qualitative to assess the distribution of expected costs and benefits. For transmission and distribution \nline routings, information and consultations with people and local communities in affected areas will be undertaken.3 \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will include a design for a full participation strategy to be \nundertaken before and during the construction period. The strategy will include the design of public information \ndisclosure about the project scope, schedule, impacts and entitlements, grievance procedures, and consultation and \nparticipation  during  resettlement  planning  and  implementation.
