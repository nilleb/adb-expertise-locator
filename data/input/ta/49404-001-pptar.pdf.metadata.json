Justification \n \n1.  Project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to prepare the investment \nproject. The overall project involves modernizing eight irrigation schemes (i.e. subprojects) \ncommanding about 33,500 ha in Binh Thuan, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Khanh Hoa and Ninh Thuan \nprovinces. The irrigation schemes are mainly open canal gravity schemes. There are some \npumped schemes in Dak Nong and Dak Lak provinces. The government has commenced \npreparation  of  feasibility  studies  of  the  subprojects  in  advance  of  the  PPTA.  The  PPTA \nconsultants will review and revise the subprojects (as needed) and undertake the due diligence \n(i.e. technical, economic, financial, environmental and social) to meet ADBs requirements. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The PPTA team will work closely with the government teams assigned to prepare the \nfeasibility studies of individual subprojects and the overall project. They will also work closely \nwith the climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) team1 to incorporate climate change \nresponsive measures in designing the project. Adopting a fully consultative process, they will \ndesign outputs that meet the stated impact and outcome of the project. They will prepare the \nproject documents required to support processing and approval of the project by ADB. They will \nalso provide start-up support to the government to mobilize implementation consultants and for \nadvance implementation actions.2 Table A3.1 summarizes major outputs and activities. \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Deliverables \nMajor Deliverables  Due Date \nInception report  Nov 2016 \nReports on agricultural sector assessment; environmental, social, poverty and gender  Dec 2016 \nimpact assessments; and river basin water resources assessments considering present \nand future demands and likely climate change impacts \nReports on economic and financial analyses; financial management and fiduciary capacity;  Jan 2017 \ngender action plans; summary poverty reduction and social strategy; initial environmental \nexaminations; resettlement plan; resettlement framework; ethnic minority plan; and climate \nrisk  and  vulnerability  assessments,  project  procurement  risk  assessments  and  risk \nmanagement plan  \nRepresentative subproject feasibility studies complying with ADB requirements; summary  Feb 2017 \nof the project\u2019s contribution to the ADB results framework; summary of how the project \npromotes development coordination;  draft procurement plan and project administration \nmanual; and master bidding documents for each type of contract \nDraft final report in the format of an ADB RRP  Mar 2017 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, RRP = Report and Recommendation of the President. \n \nC.  Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement \n \n3.  The PPTA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,300,000 of which $800,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $250,000 \nfrom the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF) and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  government  is  financing  8  feasibility  studies  and  will  provide \ncounterpart staff, office staff, basic office equipment and associated costs, data and office space \nfor PPTA consultants, and domestic transport for counterpart staff. The PPTA cost estimates \nare shown in Table A3.2. \n                                                           \n1 The CRVA will be carried out by a separate team of consultants who will mobilized coterminous with the PPTA. \n2  The PPTA consultants may be required to undertake the detailed engineering designs (DED) of 1-2 subprojects. \nThis will be done through a variation of the contract, once the proposed financing for undertaking DED from the \nProject Readiness Improvement Trust Fund is secured.
