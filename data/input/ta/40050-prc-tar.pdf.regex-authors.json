INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the 2006 Country Programming Review Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) confirmed the request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Jilin Urban Infrastructure Project (JUIP). The \nFact-Finding Mission (i) visited the project area in April 2006; (ii) discussed technical and \nsocioeconomic  issues  with  representatives  of  the  central,  provincial,  and  municipal \ngovernments;  and  (iii)  carried  out  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment,  and  rapid \nenvironmental  assessment.  This  paper  is  based  on  the  understandings  reached  by  the \nGovernment and the Mission on the TA objectives, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, \nterms of reference, and implementation arrangements.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Rapid urbanization in the PRC has not only taken its toll on the environment, but has \nalso  challenged  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to  promote  good  governance,  effective \nplanning and management, sustainable financing, and timely delivery of public services. While \nprogress  has  been  made  in  building  urban  infrastructure  over  the  past  two  decades,  this \nprogress is  concentrated in the more highly developed eastern and southern coastal plains. \nThe expansion and upgrading of public services is not keeping pace with rapid industrial growth, \nand rural migration to urban centers is now taking place in the inland regions, in response to \ngovernment policies to promote economic development and job creation in these areas.  \n \n3.  Cities in the north and west experience widespread pollution because of (i) discharge of \nuntreated wastewater, (ii) improper management of solid wastes, and (iii) inefficient burning of \ncoal for heating. Shortages of safe drinking water are common. The Government has classified \nmore than 300 cities as \u201cwater short\u201d, 108 as having serious water problems, and more than 60 \nas being critically short of water. Changchun city is included in the list of cities that are critically \nshort of water. A large number of the cities facing water shortage are in the north of the PRC. \nThe  need  to  cut  back  on  groundwater  extraction  to  sustainable  levels  because  of  salinity \nintrusion and ground subsidence has worsened the water shortage problem. The situation has \nbeen  exacerbated  by  the  pollution  of  raw  water  sources  caused  by  the  discharge  of \ninadequately treated agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastewater. Municipal wastewater is \na major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes; the most severe pollution impacts \nare in the water-deficient northern region of the PRC. Currently, only about 40% of urban \nwastewater is treated (34% in 1999) and the rest is discharged untreated into rivers and lakes. \nCities  and  towns  in  Jilin  Province  and  throughout  the  PRC  must  overcome  widespread \nenvironmental degradation and meet increasing demands for public services if they are to cope \nwith rural\u2013urban migration and assure that their economic development is sustainable.  \n \n4.  The Songhua River Basin (SRB) is the third largest in the PRC after the Changjiang and \nYellow river basins. Located in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and in the Autonomous Region \nof Inner Mongolia, SRB has a catchment area of 557,000 square kilometers and a population of \n62 million. The Songhua is one of the most polluted of the 47 major rivers, contaminated with \norganic  chemicals,  heavy  metals,  and  conventional  pollutants.  Water  pollution  is  a  major \nconstraint on sustainable economic development. An ADB cluster TA2 assisted the Government \nin implementing the transjurisdictional provisions of the Water Pollution Prevention and Control \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 April 2006.  \n2  ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Transjurisdiction  Environment \nManagement. Manila. ", "2   \nAct. To help reduce SRB\u2019s pollution, ADB approved  the Songhua River Basin Water Quality \nand Pollution Control Management TA3, to strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity for its water \nquality  and  pollution  control  management  in  the  SRB.  To  achieve  sustainable  wastewater \nmanagement and protection of water resources, contributing to upstream pollution control in the \nSRB, ADB approved the Jilin Water Supply and Sewerage Development (JWSSD) project in \n2005.4 The JUIP would strongly complement the JWSSD project.    \n \n5.  The JUIP cities are Changchun and Yanji, which have urban populations of 2.8 million \nand  420,400,  respectively.  Changchun,  the  capital  of  Jilin  Province,  is  an  industrial, \ncommunication,  and  transportation  center  in  the  northeast  PRC.  Pillar  industries  include \n(i) automobile  and  automobile  parts  manufacture,  (ii)  agricultural  products  and  by-products \nrefining,  and  (iii)  high-tech  manufacturers.  Yanji  City  is  the  capital  of  Yanbian  Korean \nAutonomous  Prefecture,  bordering  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  Democratic  People's \nRepublic of Korea. It is the economic center of east Jilin Province and is one of the most \ndeveloped cities in the province, rivaling Changchun and Jilin City. Key industrial sectors include \nfood, pharmaceuticals, textiles, farm machinery, and bus manufacture. There is a large Korean \nethnic group (60%) in Yanji. Koreans are the dominant cultural and economic force in the \nYanbian  Korean Autonomous  Prefecture. The  positive  impacts  of  the  JUIP  on  the  Korean \nindigenous peoples are (i) provision of higher-quality and reliable water supply, (ii) reduction in \nwater pollution in local rivers through improved collection and treatment of wastewater, and \n(iii) significant improvement in urban air quality through a 40% reduction in coal consumption for \nheating.5  \n \n6.  All major rivers in Changchun (Yitong and Yongchun rivers) flow into the SRB. In Yanji, \nBuerhatong River crosses the urban area from west to east and eventually empties into Tumen \nRiver. Jilin Province, therefore, has a critical role to play in wastewater management in the SRB \nand Buerhatong River. Underdevelopment of wastewater collectors in the wastewater treatment \nplant service areas in Changchun and Yanji leads to the discharge of untreated wastewater into \nlocal rivers. Water quality in the Yitong and Yongchun rivers in Changchun do not meet the \nlowest class V of the National Water Quality Standard.6 Water quality in the Yanji section of the \nBuerhatong  River  has  deteriorated  from  class  II  to  class  III  because  of  the  discharge  of \nuntreated wastewater. The lack of adequate wastewater management degrades local rivers, \nposes a threat to public health, and adversely affects the quality of life in Changchun and Yanji. \nThere is an urgent need to expand the sewer network and wastewater treatment capacity in \nChangchun  and  Yangji  to  improve  water  quality  in  the  Yitong  and  Yongchun  rivers,  and \nBuerhatong  River.  There  is  increased  focus  on  improving  the  city\u2019s  wastewater  treatment \ncoverage and capacity to contribute to controlling upstream pollution in the SRB. The ongoing \nJWSSD project and upgrades will allow Changchun to meet the state target of 70% secondary \ntreatment  by  2010.7  It  is  estimated  that  the  JUIP  will  help  Changchun  achieve  an  80% \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Jilin Water Supply and Sewerage Development Project. Manila.    \n5  The anticipated negative  impact is temporary local disruption during construction and resettlement impact. Based \non severity of the impact, two approaches will be proposed during TA implementation\u2014either through the \nresettlement plan or a specific action plan that may not entail significant cost.    \n6  The PRC Environmental Quality Standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. (i) class  \nI: water is pristine; (ii) class II: can be used for municipal drinking water supply; (iii) class III: once treated, can be \nused for municipal drinking water; (iv) class IV: can be used for industrial water supply; and (v) class V: can be \nused only for industrial cooling water, irrigation, and landscaping. \n7  State government policies require that urban environmental pollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010. \nMajor cities, such as provincial capitals, should attain a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2010. \n ", "  3\nwastewater treatment rate by 2012. Yanji municipal government is now constructing a 100,000 \ncubic meters per day (m3/day) wastewater treatment plant. On completion in 2006, it will have \nthe capacity to achieve 100% treatment of municipal wastewater discharge in Yangji. To ensure \nthat this capacity can be fully utilized, improvements in the wastewater collector system are \nurgently required.  \n \n7.  Changchun and Yanji rely primarily on surface water for their water supply. Their per \ncapita production levels are well within the normal range for the PRC.8 Under normal conditions, \nwater demand is expected to exhaust developed capacity in both Changchun and Yanji by \n2010. Both cities experienced supply problems during a severe  drought in 2004, leading to \ndangerously  low  water  levels  in  water  supply  reservoirs  and  a  resulting  loss  of  effective \ntreatment plant capacity. Changchun and Yanji experienced low water pressure and supply \ninterruptions.  \n \n8.  Changchun has a domestic solid waste management system featuring (i) domestic9 \nwaste pickup, (ii) extensive informal recovery of recyclables, and (iii) disposal in a managed \nlandfill.  Given  that  the  present  landfill  site  will  be  fully  utilized  within  18  months,  timely \nconstruction of a new domestic solid waste treatment facility is urgently needed.  \n \n9.  Yanji has a central heating plant that services the downtown core. This system services \nabout 15% of the building space (2 million square meters). It is inefficient because (i) the \nexisting distribution system does not allow efficient hot water delivery, and (ii) the plant is an \nolder  single-purpose  design  that  fails  to  achieve  the  efficiencies  possible  with  newer \ncogeneration  plants  (heat  and  power).  The  remaining  area  is  heated  by  about  700  small \ninefficient  boilers,  resulting  in  total  suspended  particles  in  the  urban  area  averaging \n0.38 milligrams (mg) per m3, more than twice the state environmental standard of 0.15 mg/m3. \nYanji will construct a new cogeneration plant10 which is expected to be completed by early 2009, \nallowing  complete  coverage  of  the  city  with  a  central  heating  service.  The  closure  and \nreplacement  of  the  700  polluting  coal-based  boilers  by  the  JUIP  would  result  in  a  major \nimprovement in Yanji\u2019s air quality, which would contribute significantly to public health in Yanji \ncity. However, to fully capture the benefits of this facility, the heating distribution system needs \nto be upgraded, and treated wastewater effluent is required for plant cooling.  \n \n10.  Sustainable development requires that Changchun and Yanji strengthen their capacities \nto manage their utility services to (i) formulate integrated urban plans, and (ii) monitor and \nenforce  environmental  regulations.  The  Jilin  provincial  government  (JPG)  has  identified  a \npriority list of investment projects totaling $300 million, of which $100 million is proposed for \nADB financing. The proposed ensuing multisector urban infrastructure development project \n(JUIP)\u2014comprising water supply and wastewater management in both cities, domestic solid \nwaste management in Changchun, and central heating in Yangi\u2014will help improve the urban \nenvironment and achieve long-term sustainable development in Changchun and Yanji. The \nJUIP is one step by JPG in a major planning exercise for pollution control on the Songhua River \nBasin. The JUIP will (i) enhance the quality of water resources; (ii) strengthen water supply, \nwastewater, and domestic solid waste management; and (iii) improve urban air quality. All \ncomponents of the JUIP have one common objective\u2014to improve the urban environment and \nenhance the quality of life in Changchun and Yanji.  \n                                                 \n8   211 liters per capita per day in Yanji and 327 liters per capita per day in Changchun. \n9   Domestic waste in the PRC includes residential and institutional waste. \n10 The project proposal for the cogeneration plant was approved by National Development Reform Commission \n(NDRC) in 1995. In 2003, NDRC confirmed that the 1995 approval was still valid.   ", "4   \n \n11.  The  JUIP  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy11  and  will  help  the  PRC  achieve \nMillennium Development Goal 7, target 10, which establishes the 2015 target of reducing by \n50% the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and improved \nsanitation. The JUIP is also consistent with ADB strategic objectives to make markets work \nmore efficiently through infrastructure development and to promote environmental sustainability \nin the PRC. Over the past decade, ADB increased its involvement in urban development and \nwater resource management in the PRC through its lending and TA operations. The knowledge \ngained  from  similar  investment  projects  in  Changchun,  Fuzhou,  Harbin,  Hefei,  Shanghai, \nTianjin, Wuhan, and Wenzhou have been incorporated in the design of the proposed TA.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The expected impact of the project preparatory TA is improved urban environment, and \nenhanced quality of life in the cities of Changchun and Yanji in Jilin Province. The expected \noutcome  is  the  agreed  design  of  the  JUIP.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1, and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will (i) evaluate the JUIP in the context of strategic long-term development plans, \nthe 11th 5-year plan, and alternative strategies for wastewater management and water supply \ncapacity,  solid  waste  management,  and  urban  heating  facilities  to  meet  the  project  cities\u2019 \nincreasing demand; (ii) identify sector investment priorities in each city; (iii) review and assess \nthe feasibility of the selected subprojects based on technical, institutional, environmental, social, \neconomic, and financial assessments; (iv) develop an institutional strengthening component, \nbased on a needs assessment for the implementing agencies (IAs) of the subprojects in each \ncity; and (v) design a corporate development plan for the IAs, based on a financial management \nassessment. Household surveys will be conducted to address issues of public awareness and \npreference, willingness to pay, and affordability. The TA will identify stakeholders and develop a \nparticipatory strategy for project preparation, design, construction, and operation. Consultation \nworkshops and tripartite meetings will be scheduled strategically during TA implementation.   \n \n14.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  that  need  to  be  considered  for  successful  TA \nimplementation  include  (i)  inadequate  counterpart  support  and  performance,  (ii)  lack  of \nadequate and timely provision of necessary data, (iii) delay in submitting required studies, \n(iv) delays  in  appointing  and  mobilizing  consultants,  and  (v)  inadequate  performance  by \nconsultants. Efforts will be made to ensure that competent consultants are recruited on time and \nthat regular performance checks are carried out on their work. The Government has agreed to \n(i) provide adequate counterpart support, (ii) provide all necessary data when required, and \n(iii) undertake and update all required studies according to a timetable agreed with ADB. Close \ncoordination among ADB, the JPG, the Executing Agency of the TA, and IAs, and consultants \nwill further mitigate potential risks. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2001.

The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance the equivalent of $500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The Government has agreed to provide the \nbalance  of  $130,000  equivalent  in  kind  through  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  furniture, \nadministrative support services, and local transport and logistics. Details of the cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  A vice governor of JPG will chair the TA steering committee, with members from the Jilin \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission;  Jilin  bureaus  of  construction,  finance,  environment \nprotection, and water resources; and Changchun and Yangji municipal governments. The TA \noffice will be headed by the vice director general of the construction bureau and will include staff \nfrom  all  the  abovementioned  bureaus  to  (i)  ensure  consultants\u2019  access  to  relevant  project \ninformation and data, and (ii) liaise with ADB on matters relating to TA implementation. Prior to \nthe start of TA implementation, the Changchun and Yanji municipal governments will establish a \nsimilar organization structure, chaired by their vice mayors, to implement the TA. JPG will \nprovide the consultants with a suitably furnished office with utilities, telecommunication access, \nmaterials, maps, data, and all required project documents.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 5 months from August to December 2006. Total \nconsultants\u2019 input is estimated at 40 person-months: 13.5 international and 26.5 domestic. The \nconsultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers, based on the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method.  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  water  supply,  wastewater \ntreatment, domestic solid waste management, district heating, financial and economic analyses, \ninstitutional and regulatory development, social analysis, resettlement, and the environment. \nThe  consultants\u2019  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  4.  ADB\u2019s  simplified  technical \nproposal approach will be used to select and engage the consultants. TA equipment will be \nprocured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, and will be \nretained by the EA on completion of the TA.   \n \n18.  The consultants will submit to ADB and JPG, in English and Chinese, the inception, \ninterim,  draft  final  (4  months  after  commencement  of  the  TA),  and  final  reports,  and  the \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment  report;  and  an  English  translation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  resettlement  plan  and  its  summary.  Study  findings  will  be  presented  in \nworkshops.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Jilin Urban Infrastructure \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
