THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee \nProgram (MFP) is the on-going project in the context of the proposed technical assistance (TA). \nThe MFP is a credit enhancement program designed to address market gaps by sharing risks to \nfacilitate local currency lending to microfinance institutions (MFIs) for on-lending to low-income \nborrowers, predominantly women. With a program limit of $600 million that is operationalized on \na revolving basis, the MFP has supported $1.8 billion in new local currency loans since its \ninception, benefiting more than 8 million borrowers across ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs).1 \n \n2.  Over the years, the MFP has expanded its scope and coverage and aims to build micro-\nfinance and related insurance, as a means to build climate change resilience. While traditionally \nmicrofinance has been limited to collateral-free loans for the poor and gradually extended to \ninclude savings, it is now a well-regulated and mature business in many markets and is being \nviewed as a comprehensive platform to deliver banking and financial security to the poor.2 One \nof the emerging roles is its linkages with the climate change and disaster vulnerable population, \na large proportion of which are in rural and peri-urban dwellings and derive their livelihoods from \nagriculture and related activities. Across ADB\u2019s DMCs, MFIs have made a significant contribution \nin supporting the income streams and livelihoods of their borrowing clients and have helped \nimprove livelihoods. In the process, MFIs also build very strong linkages and social capital with \nthe communities they serve.  \n \n3.  However, in times of disaster and in the post-disaster recovery phase, when the impacted \npopulation is in critical need of funds to meet basic needs and re-start their livelihoods, MFIs often \nfind themselves facing financial challenges related to their loan portfolio-distress, pressure on \ntheir capital and liquidity, and an inability to raise funds for on-lending.3 The MFIs\u2019 inability to \nrespond to these disaster-linked exigencies is closely linked to the lack of microinsurance \ncoverage for the micro-borrowers. If there was microinsurance cover in place, the impacted \nfamilies would be better placed to allocate the claims and their savings back into income-\ngenerating livelihoods, restoration of their homes and keeping their children in school. The climate \nchange and disaster induced distress also results in severe deterioration in the micro-borrower's \nability to service the loans taken from the MFIs, as their income streams and livelihoods are \nadversely impacted. The lack of risk-coverage or insurance and the associated inability to access \nfinance,  results  in  a  prolonged  post-calamity  recovery  often  characterized  with  regional \ndisplacement  of  the  earning  population,  social  unrest  and  distress-sale  of  the  recovered \nhousehold assets/savings, which further undermines the creditworthiness of micro-borrowers. \nWhile government and state-owned agencies step-up their work, their support is focused on \ndisaster-relief, rather than restoring livelihoods and income for post-disaster recovery. \n \n \n1  Of the $600 million limit, $260 million is for MFP\u2019s COVID-19 response which has an initial validity of 15 months (April \n2020-July 2021), subject to extension. \n2  The World Bank. 2013. The New Microfinance Handbook.  \n3  In such circumstances, it is not uncommon that the commercial lenders to the MFIs press for risk containment \nmeasures like reducing or stopping portfolio growth, retaining liquidity to meet covenants, and minimizing exposure \nto the disaster-impacted regions. \n ", "2 \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  Climate Change and Impact on the Poor. While climate change impacts all, the effects are \nhitting the world\u2019s poorest people, (such as small holder farmers) first and in the most severe \nmanner. Many are pushed back into poverty or their path to improved livelihoods and a better \nquality of life is substantially extended. Given their already fragile state, it is harder for the poor to \nrecover from droughts, hurricanes, storms and floods, leaving behind failed harvests, flood-\nravaged fields, destroyed agriculture-related income sources like cattle, damaged homes, and the \nhealth crises that often occur in the wake of a disaster.4 While their access to finance is already \nlimited, this worsens in the post-disaster stage and substantially raises the challenges to cope \nand adapt to the calamity and draw a path to restoring their livelihoods and re-building dwellings. \nThis lack of access to finance in the post-calamity stage results in a prolonged recovery and is \noften accompanied by distress sale of assets by households (HH). Many who live on the margins \nof poverty slip back into real poverty.5 It has been estimated that by 2030, climate change could \npush more than 120 million more people into poverty.6 \n \n5.  Impact of Climate Change and Disasters on Women.  Women and particularly small holder \nfarmers amongst them, are more disadvantaged in facing the impacts of climate change, as they \nhave lesser access to resources, credit, agricultural inputs, technology, training and extension \nservices, as compared to men. Since women often have less than proportionate participation in \ndecision-making and are not equally involved in the distribution of environment management \nbenefits, they are less able to manage the climate change related adversities.7 Climate change is \nmaking it harder for women to carry out household responsibilities.8Further, poor households \nwhich suffer from climate-related hazards and disasters may adopt extreme coping actions that \ncan lead to \u201clong-term and intergenerational vulnerability, such as early marriage for girls, selling \nland and other assets for less than their value, withdrawing children from school, and reducing \ntheir food consumption\u201d. Depending on the severity of the crises, some of these adverse impacts \nmay well be of intergenerational proportions.9 In this context, adopting measures that specifically \nfocus on women and help to bring a gender-development aspect to climate change mitigation and \ndisaster-mitigation responses, have a special position and role in ADB\u2019s NSO operations. The \nMFP, which deepens access to finance for women micro-borrowers, is a robust platform in \nPSOD\u2019s operations to help connect and strengthen these linkages.  \n \n \n4  J. Huxta. 2021.

Role of Financial Sector Interventions in Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience. \nThrough the past decade, planning and programming to strengthen climate change resilience is \nnow a mainstream activity in development work and it is also rapidly evolving as a focus area in \nfinancial sector interventions. Governments and donors are prioritizing integrated disaster risk \nmanagement (DRM) approaches that shift support away from reactionary crisis management; \ntowards prevention and early action, like setting up ex-ante risk financing structures.10 As a part \nof  these  efforts,  microinsurance  has  been  identified  as  a  tool  that  can  protect  vulnerable \npopulations from climate change induced shocks by acting as a safety net and buffer for their \nincome and assets against extreme weather events.  \n \n7.  While the conceptual knowledge for microinsurance has expanded, there is limited but \nsteadily expanding empirical work done to pilot test and commercialize a climate change and \ndisaster risk-coverage insurance product in the DMCs. In addition, while there are several state-\ninitiated activities, the role of private sector insurance providers has been limited. The existing \nwork in this and related fields, focuses more on activities like crop insurance, a state supported \nactivity, often surrounded with several risk coverage and implementation challenges.11 Given the \nextremely low insurance penetration levels in Asian countries, with 85% of assets12 and nearly \n90% of the populations uninsured13, rigorous assessments of the operational challenges, best-\npractices and success of climate risk focused microinsurance, particularly for the poor, are \nrelatively few and far between. The proposed TA aims to address this gap by supporting the pilot \ntesting of a parametric insurance product for micro-borrowers in India. The lessons learned from \nthe pilot testing and implementation would be (i) critical inputs in the design and roll-out of a \ncommercial scale parametric insurance product, which has not yet been mainstreamed at a \ncommercial scale in India and for most DMCs and (ii) shared within the regional DMCs, for \ndevelopment of their insurance and micro-finance sectors.  \n \n8.  TA\u2019s Linkages with PSOD\u2019s Microfinance Program. Since its inception, the MFP has \nworked with more than 30 MFIs in India and in the region, which have been selected after a \nrigorous assessment of their operations, financial and overall credit-standing. Several of these \npartner MFIs in ADB\u2019s MFP are now strongly positioned in terms of (i) their wide geographic \ncoverage in India/host country market, (ii) vast physical and social infrastructure and linkages with \nrural households, specifically women which account for 98% of their client base, (iii) adoption of \nclient protection principles and fair lending practices in operations to safeguard the interests of \ntheir borrowers, and (iv) rigorous operational and risk oversight processes embedded in their \nprogressively digitalized microfinance model. These attributes are critical in developing and pilot \ntesting a parametric microinsurance product, which is targeted at the lower income vulnerable \nsections of the DMC\u2019s population, which is also the key target client base of such well-functioning \nMFIs. \n \n9.  The MFP is very well placed to build on the synergies and utilize the well-established \nnetwork linkages built under the program for implementation of the TA. The MFP has been \nworking with the prominent MFIs (which serve nearly 70% of the microfinance market in India), \nas well as in other targeted DMCs like Bangladesh and Indonesia (and soon to include Cambodia \nand Philippines). The MFP also works closely with the country-level microfinance associations on \nbest practice and client-centric approaches to expanding financial inclusion.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n11.  The main objective of the TA is to support the development and pilot testing of a parametric \nmicroinsurance product, which will extend risk coverage to the targeted population of low-income \nhouseholds in rural areas, whose income and livelihoods are vulnerable to impacts of climate \nchange. The developed insurance product would be rolled out for initial pilot testing and eventually \non a commercial scale by using the physical infrastructure and client linkages built by MFIs and \nthese vulnerable households in pre-identified climate-change exposed regions. The pilot test \nwould entail coverage in 4 different parts of India which have been identified for their climate \nchange and disaster vulnerability, and an outreach to at least more than 3 million potential MFI \nclients through the identified MFIs. The main objectives of the TA are to help develop insurance \ncoverage which (a) addresses some of the immediate loss protection that such household would \nneed upon a calamity event, and (b) enable post-calamity relief and recovery work by allowing \naccess to finance for the impacted population through the partner MFI network. \n \n12.  In this backdrop, the TA support will be routed through to the selected MFIs which will play \nkey roles in (a) building basic awareness and enhancing the micro-borrower's understanding of \nparametric insurance by extending their field staff and branch network for the  pilot stage,  \n(b) building field-level capacity to allow dissemination of product features, highlighting the costs \nand benefits and claims processes of the insurance policies, and (c) facilitating market testing \nand validation of the insurance product\u2019s acceptability, adoption, and coverage. Later at the \ncommercial deployment stage, it is expected that these MFIs will help actively participate in post-\ndisaster recovery work by expanding access to finance in the impacted regions, given the risk \nmitigation benefit derived from the parametric insurance coverage. \n \n13.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 supporting three of its operational priorities: \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality \nand tackling climate change and building climate and disaster resilience.  The TA will continue \nADB\u2019s work to involve women in community-development  and training programs and shaping \nwomen\u2019s roles, from attendees to decision-makers as micro-insurance enrollees. The TA and the \nmicroinsurance provides a venue for social protection for rural poor women.  Moreover, the TA \nwill potentially help elevate womenfrom poverty and provide a venue for women to participate and \ncontribute to economic development.   ADB specifically focuses on addressing the impact climate \nchange has on its DMCs and their vulnerable populations, most of whom are dependent on \nagriculture, fisheries and forestry- the same sectors facing high risks from disasters brought about \nby extreme climate events. To better assist member DMCs in sustainably meeting their planned \ngrowth targets, ADB identifies \u2018tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability\u2019 as one of its mainstream operational priorities. \n \nB.

Under this insurance system, compensation is more efficient and \ntransparent  with  the  use  of  satellite  information,  and  assistance  to  more  farmers  become \nimmediate.1 \n \nSimilarly, the Government of Indonesia developed parametric insurance for climate related risks, \nfor  rice  farming.  It  has  been  modernizing  its  rice  cultivation  through  improved  irrigation \ninfrastructure and early warning systems, to better cope with droughts and support local farmers. \nUse of parametric insurance has become increasingly available for agriculture assets including \ncrops,  livestock,  and  forestry.  The  government  now  employs  regional  drought  indices  and \nprovides  province-level  payouts  in  case  of  severe  droughts.2  Similar  initiatives  are  under \nimplementation in Bangladesh.  Insurance awareness among the country\u2019s 12 million smallholder \nfarmers is being promoted by government and donor agencies.3 There are also some regional \ninitiatives, like the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (SEADRIF), a catastrophe risk \npool of funds, designed as a reinsurance-backed disaster liquidity facility with countries making \nupfront payment of contribution/premium. While this is at a national or sovereign level, the main \nadvantage is that a country will receive compensatory payouts upon eligible disaster events. \nSignatories to SEADRIF include DMCs like Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and \nPhilippines.4 \n \nSome of gaps in these initiatives evidently are: (a) they are generally state sponsored, hence \ncommercial viability is not specifically targeted; (b) while they cover an important segment of crop-\ncultivation related risks, there is no specific coverage for general non-farming rural households \n(like the landless farm laborers), or for other climate-change adversities which impact several \nother parts of rural livelihoods; (c) there is limited engagement of the private sector or an effort to \ndevelop a wider-scale insurance product which will cover a wider array of climate change-induced \nadversities and risks. Currently, there is no appropriate product to provide insurance against such \nevents, nor a capacity-building initiative, to develop and roll this out on commercial standards, \nthough some instruments do exist for specific parameters.  \n \n \n \n1  RIICE:  Remote  Sensing-based  Information  and  Insurance  for  Crops  in  Emerging  Economies \nhttps://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/52991.html accessed 22 January 2021 \n2  Indonesia - Developing parametric insurance for weather related risks for Indonesia.
