Tourism has been a priority sector of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \n(SASEC)  program,  comprising  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  Nepal,  and  Sri  Lanka,  since  its \ninception in 2001.1 At its second meeting in 2002, the SASEC Tourism Working Group (TWG) \nidentified the need for a subregional tourism development plan (TDP). The Asian Development \nBank (ADB), as part of its long-term commitment to the SASEC program,2 provided technical \nassistance3 to prepare the TDP, building on the existing tourism plans of the SASEC countries \nand in-country and subregional consultations. The TDP, completed and unanimously endorsed in \n2004, proposed a number of high-priority subregional programs based on an agreed set of core \nstrategic directions. During the sixth TWG meeting in 2005, ADB, in response to the request of \nTWG, made a commitment to provide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to design and \nassess the feasibility of a subregional tourism investment project based on the priority programs \nof the TDP. The proposed TA,4 which is included in the South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy \nand Program (2006\u20132008),5 will form a critical intervention of ADB\u2019s long term partnership for \ndeveloping an environmentally sustainable, culturally sensitive, and socially inclusive tourism \nsector that will catalyze economic growth and reduce poverty in the SASEC countries. The \npreliminary design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Tourism is one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest growing sectors, accounting for almost \n11% of global gross domestic product and more than 8% of global employment (one in every 12 \njobs).  Although  global  insecurity  led  to  a  temporary  decline  in  tourism  demand  during  \n2001\u20132002, international and domestic tourism is expected to boom over the next 15 years. The \nWorld Tourism Organization forecasts that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach \n1.6 billion by 2020, spending a total of $2 trillion per year. This represents more than double the \ninternational arrivals recorded in 2003, with projected expenditures nearly four times more than \nthe global expenditures in 2002. Tourism in the developing world is growing faster than the world \naverage. South Asia, where tourist arrivals are growing by 11%, is forecast to record an average \nannual growth of 6.2% up to 2020, compared to the world average of 4.1%. The World Travel and \nTourism Council projects that over the next 10 years the economic value of personal travel and \ntourism will increase to 5% of SASEC countries\u2019 combined gross domestic product.            \n \n3.  The SASEC subregion6 (the subregion) is endowed with vast and diverse cultural and \nnatural resources. It has an ancient cultural heritage of more than 5,000 years old, and is home to \nmany natural and cultural heritage sites inscribed in the World Heritage List. The subregion \ncontains the world\u2019s highest mountain, the eastern Himalayan range, the largest mangrove forest, \nthe longest sea beach, and internationally recognized biodiversity hotspots. It has a rich diversity \nof ethnic groups with distinctive cultures. Its unique natural and cultural endowments potentially \nposition it as a world destination for spiritual tourism and ecotourism.7 Bhutan and Nepal, in \nparticular, are internationally acknowledged as \u201cecotourism pioneers\u201d and have practitioners with \n                                                 \n1  Sri Lanka became a member of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Tourism Working Group \n(TWG) in November 2005.  \n2  Since 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the SASEC program through lending and technical \nassistance, e.g., ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n6  In this TA report, the SASEC subregion is defined as Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.  \n7  Ecotourism is defined in the tourism development plan (TDP) as \u201cstyles of tourism that enhance the conservation of \nthe environment and/or cultural and religious heritage, and respond to the needs of local communities.\u201d \n ", "2   \ndecades of experience at their disposal. The subregion is also home to the \u201cBuddhist Heartland\u201d, \nwith many of the world\u2019s major Buddhist sites, including those directly associated with the life of \nLord  Buddha.  The  ancient  monasteries,  sacred  landscapes,  and  hidden  valleys  attract \ninternational visitors who are interested in \u201cliving Buddhism\u201d.  \n \n4.  Despite an impressive range of attractions, the countries of SASEC have not realized the \nfull potential benefits from tourism. Potential tourists in the source markets widely perceive the \nsubregion as a \u201cdifficult\u201d destination. Security problems threaten tourism in Nepal, a few of the \nnortheastern states of India, and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh\u2019s image abroad has been associated with \nonly natural calamities in the absence of adequate marketing of its vast and ancient natural and \ncultural heritage. While in Bhutan, a perceived high-end, low-impact tourism policy has resulted in \na  low  volume  of  tourists.  More  importantly,  all  SASEC  countries  have  severe  infrastructure \nweaknesses,  especially  road,  rail,  and  air  connections;  electricity;  water  supply;  sanitation;  \ntelecommunications; wayside amenities; and border facilities. Further, all SASEC countries have \ninadequate standards of tourist services, especially related to immigration procedures, attitudes \ntowards hospitality, and availability of tourist information. Combined, these factors have created \nan unfavorable climate for private investment, which is vital to robust tourism development in the \nsubregion. Moreover, until recently, there has been little or no cooperation among the countries in \nthe promotion and development of products and sites. Each country has been trying to carve out \na  niche  in  the  market  without  harnessing  the  complementarities,  contiguity,  and  potential \nsynergies that are available in the subregion. \n \n5.  The  governments  of  SASEC  countries  have  recently  recognized  the  need  to  work \ntogether8 to promote the subregion as a unique tourism destination. They have acknowledged \nthat  complementary  natural  endowments  and  cultural  heritage  provide  an  opportunity  for \nsubregional cooperation in tourism, which can lead to joint product development, cost-effective \nmarketing strategies, and joint investments in tourism infrastructure development with resulting \ngreater efficiencies. Under the guidance of TWG and with support from ADB, the 10-year SASEC \nTDP  was  developed  and  adopted  in  2004  to  provide  a  coherent  framework  for  tourism \ndevelopment  in  the  subregion.  Two  product-specific  programs  that  focus  on  the  themes  of \n\u201cBuddhist circuits\u201d and \u201cecotourism based on nature and culture\u201d.9 were identified among the \nseven key programs10 of TDP. The selection of programs has been based on the agreed strategic \ndirections that (i) tourism branding should focus on SASEC\u2019s products and not on the subregion \nitself, and (ii) tourism should be environmentally and culturally sustainable and contribute to \npoverty reduction.        \n     \n6.  Under the two key programs, the TDP has identified a number of priority products that will \npotentially position the subregion as the world\u2019s premier destination of Buddhist Heartland and \necotourism. One iconic product is the popular \u201cFootsteps of Lord Buddha\u201d circuit, which appeals \nto the growing numbers of Buddhist pilgrims and spiritual tourists from all over the world. The \ncircuit receives an estimated 50,000 visitors annually. It includes a number of destinations in India \nand  Nepal,  some  of  which  are  the  World  Heritage  Sites.  Another  potential  product  is  the \nintegrated development of trekking in the majestic mountains of Himalaya following the concept of \nthe \u201cGreat Himalayan Trail\u201d that was developed by Nepal. This concept favors lateral trekking \nover  \u201cup  and  back\u201d  treks,  and  thus  has  the  potential  to  bring  ecotourism  benefits  to  poor \n                                                 \n8  Working together is also deemed to complement the national efforts on tourism, e.g., India\u2019s recent initiative for a \nnational tourism infrastructure development program.    \n9  The seven subregional programs are (i) coordinated marketing, (ii) enhancing product quality, (iii) facilitating travel, \n(iv) developing human resources, (v) Buddhist circuit development, (vi) ecotourism development, and (vii) private \nsector participation.      \n10  The seven subregional programs are (i) coordinated marketing, (ii) enhancing product quality, (iii) facilitating travel, \n(iv) developing human resources, (v) Buddhist circuit development, (vi) ecotourism development, and (vii) private \nsector participation.      \n ", "  3\ncommunities  in  valleys  currently  bypassed  by  popular  trekking  routes.  It  also  provides \nopportunities for linking established treks in Bhutan, India, and Nepal.  \n  \n7.  Opportunities  exist  for  tourism  growth  in  the  subregion, building  on  current  and  new \nmarkets. The current market and consumer trends indicate that the experienced traveler prefers \nauthentic, off-the-beaten-track vacations in remote, unrenowned places to luxurious vacations. \nGlobal trends also indicate the growing demand for nature- and culture-based holidays, and \nspiritual tourism which are forecast to double and perhaps even triple in the next 20 years. The \ngrowing interest in cultural and spiritual tourism and ecotourism presents enormous opportunities \nfor the SASEC countries, provided that the subregion can avail of the opportunities presented to it. \nAt this juncture of subregional cooperation in tourism, with critical programs, e.g., joint marketing, \nhuman resource development, and travel facilitation being underway, efforts need to focus on joint \nproduct development. There is need to combine individual country assets into attractive and \nmarketable circuits to.foster synergies across borders. Countries must work together to plan and \ndevelop infrastructure and services in these cross-border circuits and destinations in an integrated \nmanner. Investments are urgently needed for enhanced access and connectivity; destination \ninfrastructure and facilities; and sustainable tourism destination management and service delivery. \nThe TA is required to help SASEC countries jointly develop multicountry circuits associated with \nspiritual tourism and nature- and culture-based ecotourism.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.      The TA aims to enhance the positioning of the subregion in both intraregional and \ninterregional markets as one of the world\u2019s leading destinations of spiritual tourism and nature- \nand culture-based ecotourism. The expected outcome of the TA is the development of good-\nquality, high-yielding subregional products that focus on the Buddhist circuits and ecotourism. To \nthis end, the TA will assess the feasibility of and design a project for possible ADB financing of a \npackage  of  priority  investments  in  tourism-related  infrastructure  and  facilities  in  selected \nmulticountry circuits, resulting in an improved tourist experience and thus increased arrivals and \nlengthened stay of tourists in the subregion. The TA, that will cover all five SASEC TWG member \ncountries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and Sri Lanka, will complement other ongoing \nTDP programs, e.g., joint marketing, private sector participation, human resource development, \nand  travel  facilitation.  The  TA  will  also  benefit  from  ADB\u2019s  earlier  experience  with  other \nsubregional and national tourism projects.11  \n \n9.  The ensuing project is expected to include critical investments in roads, airports, wayside \namenities,  visitor  facilities,  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  power, \ncommunication, and small-scale and environment-friendly ecotourism infrastructure and facilities. \nThe project is also expected to include proposals for improved systems and reforms for tourism \n(visitor  and  destination)  management,  infrastructure  maintenance,  and  environmental \nmanagement for sustainable tourism development. Furthermore the ensuing project is likely to \ninclude  interventions  for  product-specific  marketing,  human  resource  development,  travel \nfacilitation, and private sector participation to supplement other ongoing programs under the TDP. \n \n                                                 \n11  ADB provided a loan for Greater Mekong Subregional Tourism Development Project (2002) and two loans (1991\u2013\n1996) for Nepal tourism infrastructure projects as well as modest support for tourism in few urban projects, which \nproved to be highly relevant to the objectives of ADB and member countries. The lessons suggest: (i) importance of \nprivate sector involvement in designing and implementing tourism products to ensure viability; (ii) ecotourism can \nsucceed, and partnership with nongovernment organizations and community can enhance the effectiveness and \nsustainability; (iii) need for marketing of the tourism products; (iv) need for greater attention to sustainability; and (v) \nrequirement for upfront capacity building of project management and implementing agencies for efficient project \nimplementation.   \n ", "4   \n10.  The ensuing project will have synergies with other SASEC sector programs such as \n\u201cregional connectivity\u201d. Accompanied by other related interventions, the project is expected to lead \nto (i) sustainable and broad-based economic growth with direct and multiplier effects for local \nemployment  and  poverty  reduction,12 (ii)  improved  connectivity  and  environment  for  local \ncommunities, (iii) increased provision of complementary private sector investments induced by the \nimproved availability of critical public infrastructure and services, (iv) enhanced conservation of \nunique material and nonmaterial culture and environment, and (v) a stronger sense of community \namong the countries and peoples of the subregion.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will build on the SASEC TDP. It will review the proposals of the TDP in terms of \nthe circuits and sites associated with the life of Lord Buddha13 and with nature- and culture-based \necotourism. The selection and confirmation of the priority circuits, sites, and destinations will also \ntake into account (i) the updated market research; (ii) uniqueness of the sites in terms of natural, \ncultural, and religious significance; (iii) the potential for promoting subregional tourism growth \nwithout detriment to local culture and environment; and (iv) the potential for fostering private \nsector investments in developing tourist facilities and services. In the identification of circuits and \ninvestment proposals, particular attention will be given to determining and harnessing the links \nbetween Buddhist circuits and ecotourism development. Opportunities to develop ecotourism near \nBuddhist sites or to extend Buddhist circuits to include other destinations14 of religious, cultural, \nand natural importance will be investigated so as to expand the subregion\u2019s appeal to new \nmarkets.    \n \n12.  The TA will develop a clear concept of tourism development based on the principles of \nenvironmental sustainability, cultural sensitivity, and social inclusiveness within a \u201csubregional\u201d \ncontext. Close coordination will be maintained with the \u201cintegrated product development plan for \necotourism  based  on  natural  and  cultural  heritage\u201d  being  prepared  by  TWG  to  ensure  \n(i)  systematic  identification  of  tourism  products,  (ii)  integration  of  subregional  and  national \nproducts, and (iii) consistency of SASEC tourism approaches with principles of the World Tourism \nOrganization and other relevant organizations. \n \n13.  Following the principles of the established concept, the TA will assess the constraints to \nthe growth and management of tourism and necessary interventions in terms of access, utility \ninfrastructure  development,  environmental  services,  marketing,  security,  and  cross-border \nfacilitation within the identified sites. The TA will then develop feasible proposals to enhance the \nconnectivity,  utility  infrastructure,  environmental  services  as  well  as  tourism  and  destination \nmanagement and visitor services in selected priority areas.    \n \n14.  Mechanisms will be developed to ensure that (i) the local communities are linked with \ncurrent and expanded tourism markets and share the benefits of increased tourism; and (ii) the \ntourists,  host  communities,  and  the  public  take  effective  responsibility  for  conserving  and \nstrengthening the fragile cultural and natural heritage and environment. The design of the project \nwill draw upon the experience of similar projects and good practices such as Ajanta Ellora \nConservation and Tourism Development Project of India. The TA will also explore ways to make \nuse of the comparative advantages, experiences, and grant co-financing of other development \npartners (e.g., assistance for technical know-how in the conservation of heritage sites as a \ncomplement to the ensuing project interventions). \n \n                                                 \n12 The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.   \n13 The review will include the monastic circuit linking Bhutan to India and other sites in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. \n14 Examples of other destinations are the renowned Taj Mahal, several Hindu and Shiekh temples in India, and Shaat \nGambus Mosque in Bangladesh. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Details of the cost estimates are \nin Appendix 3. The governments  of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka were \nadvised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to fund any ensuing project. ADB will not \nfinance any undertaking or activity in the territory of any member country unless and until it has \nreceived from the government of such member country a letter of no-objection or concurrence \nwith respect to such activity or undertaking.  \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. The TA will be managed by ADB\u2019s South Asia Region \nUrban Development Division (SAUD). The work will be undertaken on behalf of the SASEC TWG. \nNational tourism organizations (NTOs) will be the TA focal agencies in each participating country, \nand will nominate TA focal persons to be responsible for providing the required national inputs \ninto the TA. NTOs will coordinate with national consultative groups, representatives of pertinent \ncentral and local government agencies, nongovernment organizations, the private sector, and the \ntourism industry.  \n \n17.     The TA will be implemented over 10 months, from March 2007 to January 2008, and will \nrequire about 59 person-months of consulting services (33 person-months international/regional \nand 26 person-months national). A team of consultants with expertise in tourism planning and \nproduct  development,  ecotourism  development  and  management,  tourism  infrastructure \ndevelopment and management, environment, economic and financial analysis, tourism marketing, \nand community outreach and social development will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The selection of \nconsultants will follow the cost- and quality-based selection and simplified technical proposal \nprocedure. NTOs will provide office space and facilities and suitably qualified counterpart staff for \nthe consultants. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n18.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report outlining the TA implementation method \nand a detailed work plan, within 1 month of the start of the TA; (ii) an interim report containing fully \njustified  proposals  for  subregional  circuits  and  destinations  as  well  as  an  assessment  of \nrequirements for tourism infrastructure and management, within 5 months of the start of the TA; \nand (iii) a draft final report providing project proposals and detailed feasibility assessment for a \nsubregional tourism investment project, within 9 months of mobilization. \n  \n19.  The TA will follow a participatory approach. In-country workshops will be held to collect \nfeedback from stakeholders and to disseminate and validate the key outputs of the TA. Three \nregional workshops will also be held with participation of TWG at key stages of the TA, i.e., after \nthe submission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. ADB will coordinate with other \nsector working groups, including the environment working group under the SASEC program, and \nother development partners involved in tourism development in the subregion. Within ADB, SAUD \nwill  coordinate  as  needed  with  the  transport  and  agriculture,  natural  resources,  and  social \nservices divisions of the South Asia Department.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis for \npreparing the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Tourism Development Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions and  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting  Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \n\u2022 Enhanced positioning of  \u2022  25% increase in economic  \u2022  Tourism statistics of  \u2022 The subregion is \nthe SASEC subregion in  benefits from tourism by  Bangladesh,  politically stable. \nintraregional and  2020  Bhutan, India,  \u2022 The subregion is \ninterregional tourism  \u2022  25% increase in  Nepal, and Sri  perceived as secure. \nmarkets as one of the  employment from tourism  Lanka  \u2022 Other key programs of \nworld\u2019s premier  by 2020  \u2022  WTO statistics     TDP and SASEC \ndestinations for Buddhist    proceed concurrently.  \ncircuits and ecotourism,  Risks \nleading to broad-based  \u2022 Insecurity  \neconomic growth and  \u2022 Delay in other key \nreduction of poverty in  programs of TDP \nthe subregion  \nOutcome      Assumptions \n\u2022 Development of  \u2022  Percentage increase in  \u2022  Tourism statistics of  \u2022 The governments of \nenvironmentally and  tourist arrivals in the  Bangladesh,  SASEC countries \nculturally sustainable  subregion   Bhutan, India,  remain committed to \nand socially inclusive  \u2022  Percentage increase in  Nepal, and Sri  promoting the \ntourism in the subregion  length of stay of tourists in  Lanka  subregion as a unique \n  the subregion   \u2022  WTO statistics  destination. \n\u2022  Expansion of the existing  \u2022  Specific design  \u2022 Other key programs of \ntourism circuits and  features and  TDP proceed in \ndestinations linking to new  implementation  parallel, especially \nlocal populations  effectiveness of the  those related to travel \n\u2022  Increase in awareness and  subregional tourism  facilitation, private  \nsustainable use of natural  project   sector participation, and \nand cultural heritage    joint marketing.   \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n\u2022 An agreed upon design  \u2022 Preparation of the TA  \u2022  TA reports   \u2022 A high-quality project \nfor a proposed  approach, methodology, and  \u2022  ADB mission\u2019s aide  preparatory TA final \nsubregional tourism  work plan (within 1 month of  memoire  report provides good \ndevelopment project  TA start)   \u2022  TWG meetings   analysis and proposals. \ncontaining feasible  \u2022 Development of concept for  \u2022  Project discussions  \u2022 Qualified consultants \ninvestment proposals  tourism development,  with stakeholders at  are mobilized in a \nfor truly marketable  reconfirmation of circuits and  workshop   timely manner. \nmulticountry circuits  sites, assessment of    \u2022 A good, viable design is \nand sites  investment requirements,  developed. \nand preparation of  \u2022 Sufficient resources \npreliminary project proposals  and timely inputs are \n(within 5 months of TA start)   provided to support \n\u2022 Feasibility assessment and  implementation of the \ndesign of a subregional  TA by ADB, TWG, and \ntourism development project  NTOs.  \n(undertaken and submitted  Risk \nwithin 9 months of TA start)  \u2022 Delay in TA \n\u2022 Consensus and agreement  implementation \nreached on the proposed   \nproject, as reflected in TWG \nmeetings proceedings (within \n10 months of TA start)    \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nActivities with Milestones    Inputs  \n1.

As evidenced in the \nSASEC countries, the sector generates more jobs than any other sector and thus contributes to local livelihood. An important \nfeature of the sector is that customers come to the product, thereby providing opportunities for multiplier effects. Tourism \nproducts mostly depend on natural capital, culture, and traditional skills/arts that are generally the assets of the poor\u2014\nimplying the great potential of the sector for poverty reduction. The tourism sector in the developing world is growing faster \nthan the world average. South Asia, with its vast and diverse cultural and natural endowments and tourist attractions, is \nforecast to record an average annual growth of 6.2% to 2020, compared to the world average of 4.1%. Since 2000, tourism \nhas been a priority sector of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported SASEC program, comprising Bangladesh, \nBhutan, India, Nepal, and more recently Sri Lanka. These countries recognized the need to work together to promote the \nsubregion as a unique tourism destination to maximize the developmental impact of the individual country interventions in \ntourism. They acknowledged that complementary natural-resource endowments, heritage, and culture provide immense \nscope for subregional cooperation in tourism, which can lead to joint product development, joint and cost-effective marketing \nstrategies, and joint investments in tourism infrastructure development with resulting greater efficiencies. A tourism working \ngroup (TWG) was formed in 2000 under SASEC. ADB, as part of its long-term commitment to the SASEC program, provided \na technical assistance (TA) to prepare a subregional tourism development plan to provide a framework and plan of actions for \ncoordinated tourism development in the subregion. The Tourism Development Plan (TDP), which was completed and \nunanimously endorsed by all the countries, proposed a number of high-priority subregional programs. Two product-specific \nprograms with focus on the themes of \u201cBuddhist circuits\u201d and \u201cecotourism\u201d were identified among the key programs. During its \nsixth meeting in 2005, the TWG requested ADB to provide a TA to assess the feasibility of and design a subregional tourism \ndevelopment project based on the priority programs of TDP. ADB has included a project preparatory TA for a tourism \ndevelopment project in the South Asia regional cooperation strategy and program (2006\u20132008). The proposed TA will form a \ncritical intervention of ADB\u2019s long-term partnership for developing an environmentally sustainable, culturally sensitive, and \nsocially inclusive tourism which will catalyze broad-based economic growth and reduce poverty in the SASEC subregion.     \n \n \nB. Poverty Analysis             Proposed Classification:  General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nA poverty and social analysis will be carried out in each of the participating countries to (i) assess the poverty and social \nconditions of the population that will be affected by the project; (ii) explore the potential role, and later identify the level of \ninvolvement, of communities at national and subregional levels; (iii) determine the positive and negative impacts of tourism \nactivities on different population groups; (iv) identify ways to pass on the benefits of increased tourism to the affected \npopulation by linking communities with the current and expanded tourism markets; (v) mitigate or help reduce the negative \neffects of land acquisition and resettlement, as well as rapid economic development, on population groups, the environment, \nthe living culture, and the cultural heritage; and (vi) identify measures to ensure more equitable project outcomes.  \n \n \nC. Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?               Yes  \n \nA stakeholder analysis will be undertaken to identify key project stakeholders, their interests, and the way these interests \naffect project risk and viability. Stakeholders will likely include (i) the SASEC tourism working group; (ii) national tourism \norganizations; (iii) tourism ministries; (iv) local government authorities and service providers in selected tourism circuits and \ndestinations;  (v)  private  sector  groups  such  as  tour  operators  and  existing  and  potential  private  investors;  (vi)  local \ncommunities;  (vii)  local  and  international  nongovernment  organizations  and  bilateral  agencies  involved  in  tourism \ndevelopment in the region; and (viii) domestic, regional, and international tourists. Stakeholders will also include people \naffected by the project in terms of resettlement and land acquisition and indigenous people.   \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \nIs there a participation strategy?               Yes \n \nBased on the above stakeholder analysis, a participation strategy will be prepared to outline how to involve various \nstakeholders at different stages of the project cycle. Emphasis will be placed on ensuring the fair representation of each \ngroup, especially the poor and the excluded. It is envisaged that the participation strategy will involve three levels of \nparticipation/consultation instruments, i.e., subregional workshops, national consultative meetings, and community-outreach \nactivities. Inputs from the community-outreach activities at the local level will be discussed and evaluated at national \nconsultative meetings and later shared at subregional workshops.    \n \nD. Gender Development                \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: A detailed gender analysis will be conducted during project preparation to \ndetermine how project benefits can be maximized for women in the tourism industry. The roles, responsibilities, needs, and \ninterests of both men and women will be analyzed. Men and women play different roles in the tourism industry. Women \nprovide more upfront services and have an important role in the home. If managed properly, tourism can contribute to the \npromotion of gender equality and empower women. Environmental improvements, better awareness of hygiene and food \nsafety, improved skills (through training), and more representation in managerial positions could strengthen women\u2019s role and \nincrease their participation in the industry. Women are also more vulnerable to negative social effects of tourism. A gender \naction plan will be prepared under the TA to develop measures to ensure that (i) women actively participate in the project \ndesign as well as project implementation, (ii) women and men benefit equally from the project, (iii) the project addresses the \ndifferential gender needs, and (iv) potential negative social impacts of the tourism on women are avoided.  \n   \nE. Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks   \n       \nItem  Significant/  Strategy to Address Issues  Plan Required \n  Not Significant/ \nNone \nResettlement  Not significant  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  avoided  or  minimized  Yes - short \n  wherever possible. The project design will ensure that most of the  resettlement \nimprovements  will  be  carried  out  within  the  right  of  ways  and  on  plans  \ngovernment land. However, minimal land acquisition might be required. \nThe TA will thoroughly review and confirm the need for full or short \nresettlement plans and prepare the required safeguards in consultation \nwith stakeholders in each participating country.  \nAffordability  Not significant  During project preparation, ways to increase the participation of the  Yes -\n  poor and vulnerable groups in managing their own tourism development  affordability \nwill be explored. Ways to increase the locally produced goods and  analysis \nservices for tourism development will also be considered. Selection of   \ndesign options for infrastructure services in selected destinations will \nconsider the affordability of the households. The potential negative \nimpact of utility tariffs (water sanitation, solid waste collection fees) on \nthe poor will be reviewed and addressed by employing pro-poor service \ncharges and other innovative financing instruments.  \nLabor  None  Construction, operation and maintenance of the ensuing project are  No. The \nlikely  to  generate  significant  employment  opportunities.  Enhanced  economic \ntourism infrastructure will attract private investments to the selected  analysis may \nlocalities in tourist services such as hotels, retail industry, tour operating  include an \nand  guide  services,  which  will  contribute  to  local  and  regional  assessment of \nemployment generation.   employment \n   opportunities.  \nIndigenous  Not significant   The social analysis will assess the potential impact of the project on  Yes \nPeoples  indigenous groups and ethnic minorities in each country. The project   \n  will  be  designed  to  ensure  that  no  adverse  impact  is  made  on \nindigenous people. The TA will further verify if there are any potential \nissues  and  prepare  an  indigenous  people  development  plan  if \nnecessary.  \nOther Risks  Not significant   While  tourism  brings  economic  growth  and  contributes  to  poverty  Yes \nand/or  reduction, it has also potential to initiate rapid social changes. The \nVulnerabilities  movement of people and goods across borders may also increase \n   social and health risks and exploitation of women and child. Risks will \nbe assessed during project preparation and measures to minimize them \nwill be incorporated into the project design.  \n \n ", "10     Appendix 3 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n     ($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.
