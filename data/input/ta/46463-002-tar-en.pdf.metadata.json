The Government of Bhutan has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in building the capacity of the National Environment Commission \n(NEC) for adapting to climate change through integrated water resources management (IWRM). \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for Bhutan1and has \n \nbeen prepared with the government and NEC during two consultation missions to Bhutan. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Integrated  water  resources  management  is  a  holistic  approach  to  integrating  water \nresources  management  within  the  broader  environmental,  socioeconomic,  and  political \nframework, and provides a basis for stronger coordination between all stakeholders in planning \nand managing water resources in river basins. In Bhutan, with its rich natural environment, \nsteep terrain, abundant water resources, and as an emerging economy, IWRM can play an \nimportant role in the sustainable development of the country's vast hydropower resources. It \nalso can protect the health and quality of Bhutan\u2019s watersheds and freshwater resources, and \naddress the following challenges related to satisfying future demands for drinking, sanitation, \nagriculture, and other needs, particularly in view of anticipated climate change impacts such as \nvarying seasonal rainfall and floods: \n(i)  Watershed  protection  and  management  of  sub-basins  for  multisectoral  use. \nSustainable development of water resources should ensure effective water allocation \namong  sectors  \u2014irrigation,  drinking  supply,  recreation,  dry-season  hydropower \ngeneration, and environmental flows. Sub-basins are the main sources for drinking water \nand irrigation. Despite an overall national abundance of per capita water availability, in \nmany sub-basins water resources are less dependable, limiting access to drinking water \nand  agricultural  productivity  for  extended  periods  every  year.  These  sources  are \nprimarily  rainfed  and  springfed,  and  there  are  various  reported  cases  of  sources \nbecoming dry during the winter season or permanently dry in some places. This has led \nto an increasing number of water-related conflicts between communities and users. \nPlanned agricultural expansion and future population growth will place more pressure on \nthese resources. \n(ii)  Irrigated agriculture. Irrigated agriculture consumes more than 80% of used water, \nprimarily for growing rice. Rice is Bhutan\u2019s most important cereal crop and has cultural, \ntraditional,  and  environmental  significance.  Its  production,  however,  has  been \nconstrained  by  shortages  in  water  availability  and  labor. The Tenth Five-Year  Plan \nfocuses on food self-reliance, while the draft plan emphasizes expanding irrigation and \nimproving  water  management  by  (a)  increasing  the  secured  irrigated  area  through \nrehabilitation and construction of new infrastructure; (b) increasing irrigation efficiency; \n(c) improving  the  productivity  of  water  through  on-farm  practices  such  as  applying \nSystem of Rice Intensification practices, mechanization, and crop diversification; and (d) \nbuilding capacity among irrigation engineers and farmers.  \n(iii)  Water supply and sanitation. Sub-basin tributaries and springs cater for most of the \ncountry's domestic water supply in both urban and rural areas. Water scarcity in these \nseasonal  sub-basins  is  threatening  overall  security  in  meeting  water  supply  and \nsanitation needs. This scarcity is expected to worsen in the future from (a) population \ngrowth;  (b) urban  migration;  (c) increasing  per  capita  consumption;  (d) increasing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 July 2013. \n ", "2   \ncompetition  between  sectors,  particularly  irrigated  agriculture;  (e) reduced  water \navailability;3 (f) increasing pollution of water sources; and (g) increasing temperatures \nand evapotranspiration due to climate change. Lack of comprehensive water resource \ndata, understanding of alternative sources and integrated technical approaches, and \ninstitutional direction and coordination to plan and manage water supply and sanitation \nalso limits access to safe and secure water. \n(iv)  Water-induced  disaster  risk  management. The main river systems originate from \nmore than 2,674 glacial lakes, some of which pose the threat of glacial lake outburst \nfloods (GLOFs). GLOFs had occurred in 1957, 1960, 1968, and 1994 with varying \nintensity, damage to properties, and loss of life. Bhutan is also prone to flash floods, \nespecially in the eastern and southern foothill regions, due to the steep terrain, fragile \ngeology, and high rainfall. In 2009, Cyclone Aila, originating in the Bay of Bengal, \ncaused  one  of  the  worst  recent  disasters  in  Bhutan.  The  resulting  floods  were \nexperienced across the country, causing loss of life and damaging agriculture land, \nroads, bridges, schools, hydropower stations, and other infrastructure. The cyclone also \ntriggered  landslides  that  isolated  numerous  communities  and  caused  sedimentation \nwithin rivers, which impaired hydropower generation. Bhutan also experiences dry and \ndrought conditions, most recently in 2005 and 2006 with no rain and snow. \n(v)  Resilience and adaptation to climate change. Climate change projections4 indicate \nthat by 2069, there may be an increase of more than 2 degrees in the current annual \nmean  temperature,  a  20%  increase  in  current  total  annual  precipitation,  and  more \nfrequent extreme rainfall. Winters are predicted to become drier and warmer. Climate \nchange  impacts  include  (a)  glacial  retreat  in  the  Himalaya\u2013Hindu  Kush  region  and \nelimination of smaller glaciers caused by increased temperatures; (b) increased and \ndecreased  flows  in  the  main  and  tributary  rivers  depending  on  location  and  input \nparameters; and (c) increased variability, magnitudes, and frequencies of precipitation-\nrelated disasters such as floods, typhoons, and cyclones. Major secondary impacts \ninclude (a) increased frequency and intensity of GLOFs resulting from glacier melting; \n(b) landslides and increased soil erosion resulting from severe storms; and (c) changes \nin  temperature,  solar  radiation,  and  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  content,  which  will \nimpact crop yields. Risks from climate change include loss of property, more deaths and \ninjuries, less agricultural productivity, and reduction in hydropower generation. Bhutan\u2019s \ncurrent  resilience  to  predicted  climate  change  is  low,  and  adaptation  planning  is \nnecessary to minimize negative impacts on population, environment, and economy. \n3.  The  government  recognizes  IWRM  being  the  key  to  addressing  these  challenges, \nmaking it a cross-cutting objective of the environment sector in the Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2008\u2013\n2013 and in the draft Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2014\u20132019; and by enacting the Water Act in \n2011, which is founded on the principles of IWRM. To support implementation of the Water Act, \nNEC is preparing an initial edition of the Water Regulation to be promulgated in 2014.5 The \ngovernment has requested this TA to assist NEC in expanding and implementing the regulation, \nwith other relevant agencies. The regulation will promote IWRM as an effective mechanism for \noverall river basin management and will strengthen resilience against current climate variability \nand anticipated impacts of climate change. \n                                                \n3  Owing to declining spring flow, loss of snowpack, and watershed degradation. \n4  National Environment Commission. 2011.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  that  climate-adaptive  water  resource \nmanagement is adopted in Bhutan. The outcome will be that Bhutan\u2019s institutional capacity for \nintegrated water resources management is improved. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n5.  The TA focuses on capacity development and will have the following outputs: \n \n6.  Output 1: National IWRM Plan is finalized. Finalization of the National IWRM Plan \n(NIWRMP) will consist of (i) updating NEC\u2019s geographic information system (GIS)-based water \ninventory and preparing baseline data and systems to monitor future water resources, water \nusage,  and  management; (ii)  updating  hydrometeorological  data  based  on  latest  projected \nclimate change scenarios and downscaling methods; (iii) preparing broad water balances for all \nriver basins and sub-basins for current and future conditions; (iv) installing a tailored \u201cWisdom\u201d \nagreement database system6 (or similar system) for managing water allocations and effluent \ndischarges; (v) identifying critical basins and sub-basins where water scarcity occurs now or is \nlikely to occur in the future; (vi) compiling and preparing a summary overview of water resource \nissues,  constraints,  and  opportunities  nationally  and  in  river  basins;  (vii)  preparing  and \nimplementing a communications plan for information dissemination and consultation with the \npublic  and  other  government  agencies  on  water-related  issues;  (viii)  undertaking  local \nworkshops  to  disseminate  collected  information  and  analyses,  and  to  obtain  stakeholder \nfeedback and participation in the preparation of the NIWRMP; (ix) prioritizing river basins and \nsub-basins  for  preparation  of  river  basin  management  plans  (RBMPs);  (x)  preparing  a \nframework for routine updating of the NIWRMP based on the spiral model of the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and for benchmarking Bhutan\u2019s \ncurrent status using the Asian Water Development Outlook 20137 water security indicators; and \n(xi) preparing the NIWRMP and disseminating it publicly. \n \n7.  Output 2: A river basin management plan for one priority major river basin is \nfinalized. This will consist of (i) preparing detailed maps of the river basin showing watersheds, \nland  uses,  main  infrastructure,  administration  boundaries,  key  sub-basins,  and  water \nabstractions and effluent discharges; (ii) preparing a detailed water balance for the river basin \nand key sub-basins, for both current and future watershed and climate conditions; (iii) identifying \ncritical sub-basins where water scarcity occurs now or is likely to occur in the future, using both \nthe water balance results and a participatory approach; (iv) preparing basic flood hazard maps8 \nfor main river channels that account for GLOFs, storm burst floods, and monsoon and cyclonic \nevents; (v) identifying priority IWRM infrastructure investments with the participation of relevant \ndepartments,  local  government,  and  water  user  associations  (WUAs),  and  preparing  the \ninvestment subprojects at a concept level;9 and (vi) preparing the RBMP document to form the \nframework for preparing RBMPs in other river basins.  \n \n                                                \n6  Wisdom is an open-source database system used in the Mekong River Basin to manage water agreements.   \n7  Asian Development Bank. 2013.

Output 3: National Irrigation Master Plan is finalized. This will involve supporting the \nDepartment of Agriculture (DOA) in (i) updating the irrigation inventory to aid preparation of the \nNational Irrigation Master Plan (NIMP); (ii) assessing how climate change, population growth, \nand  internal  migration  will  affect  agricultural  practices  in  Bhutan;  (iii)  reviewing  Bhutan\u2019s \nirrigation,  agriculture,  and  livestock  policies,  and  accounting  for  the  projected  changes; \n(iv) preparing an integrated irrigation investment strategy and road map at the national, district, \nand subdistrict levels, accounting for the outcomes of tasks (ii) and (iii); (v) recommending \ninternational best practices and technologies for use in Bhutan to improve the design of current \nand  planned  investments;10 (vi)  selecting  priority  interventions  and  preparing  investment \nsubprojects at the concept level with WUA participation; (vii) strengthening and supporting \nimplementation of a monitoring and evaluation system; and (viii) preparing the NIMP. \n \n9.  Output 4: Water resources governance strengthened. This will comprise (i) updating \nand expanding the current version of the Water Regulation to factor in emerging issues; (ii) \ndemarcating roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in basins, sub-basins, and districts to \nsupport preparation of the NIWRMP and RBMPs; (iii) supporting the formation of a river basin \ncommittee (RBC) for the priority river basin (output 2); (iv) preparing institutional and human \nresource development plans to support implementation of the Water Act, Water Regulation, and \nNIMP for NEC, DOA, other relevant departments, and the RBC; (v) developing a framework for \ninteragency coordination for development and management of water resources, and facilitating \ncoordination  between  the  agencies  during  the  project;  (vi)  undertaking  training  needs \nassessments  for  NEC,  relevant  departments,  and  RBC;  (vii) preparing  and  implementing \nnational training courses, and international training courses if required; (viii) facilitating budget \nplanning and support from the Ministry of Finance for mainstreaming duties into NEC\u2019s and \nother relevant agencies\u2019 normal operations; and (ix) updating the 1990 Irrigation Engineering \nManual. \n \n10.  The TA design assumes that (i) NEC and other key stakeholders continue to support the \ninitiatives developed under the TA, and prepare and implement RBMPs for the remaining river \nbasins;  (ii)  government  agencies  and  local  communities  accept  and  implement \nrecommendations  in  the  planning  documents  and  capacity  development  programs;  and \n(iii) good  intersector  coordination  continues  and  supports  preparation  and  agreement  of \nplanning  documents.  There  is  a  risk  that  climate  change  impacts  are  more  severe  than \nanticipated and that the future behavior of the climate and resulting impacts on water resources \nremain uncertain. This may constrain the development of effective national and river basin plans \nfor water resources management and subsequent investments. To mitigate the risk, the TA will \nuse the latest climate-model-based projections based on the most recent models and methods. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.00 million, of which $1.50 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and $0.25 million by the Multi-Donor Trust \nFund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility,11 both to be administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will fund the remainder in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, data, \nfacilities, and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                \n10 The Pilot Asia-Pacific Climate Technology Finance Center will assist in determining appropriate climate adaptation \ntechnologies and related financing options for incremental costs. \n11 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  NEC will be the executing agency for the TA. NEC\u2019s Water Resources Division, in close \ncollaboration  with  the  Climate  Change  Division,  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  all \ncomponents related to IWRM, while DOA will be the implementing agency for outputs related to \nthe preparation of the NIMP. Both NEC and DOA are expected to provide staff in technical roles \nsuch  as  updating  of  water  resources  and  irrigation  inventory,  hydrological  modeling,  and \ndatabase development. The Bhutan Water Partnership12 is expected to assist with stakeholder \nconsultations and knowledge sharing.  \n13.  The TA will require 50 person-months of international and 30 person-months of national \nconsulting inputs. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The team of experts will be \nprovided by a consulting firm recruited through the quality- and cost-based selection method \nwith a 90:10 ratio and full technical proposal. This ratio is necessary to ensure high-quality \npreparation of the outputs, because they are to provide a sound basis for future successful \nwater resources management in Bhutan. Individual consultants will be recruited as needed to \nmanage unforeseen issues. ADB will recruit consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting services extend \nover 18 months. The TA is expected to begin in April 2014 and close in December 2015, which \nwill allow additional inputs that may be needed for revisions and follow-ups. All disbursements \nunder the TA will be  made in accordance with  ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n14.  Knowledge  dissemination  will  include  planning  documents  and  workshops.  Good \npractices and lessons learned will be disseminated through (i) seminars in ADB; (ii) a workshop \nof the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations; (iii) a national workshop; (iv) knowledge \nproducts that may cover (a) applying IWRM to adapt to climate change and resolve water \nconflict,  (b)  developing  water  inventories  in  mountainous  regions  using  remote  sensing \ntechnology, (c) preparing RBMPs, and (d) formulating an RBC; and (v) publication of all outputs \non the ADB website, if applicable. \n \nIV.
