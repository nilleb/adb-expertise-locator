THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed equity \ninvestments in climatech venture capital funds of (i) up to $20 million (or the equivalent in Euro) \nin Aloe Environment Fund III (Aloe Fund), (ii) up to $20 million in Keytone Ventures II (Keytone \nFund) in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and (iii) up to $20 million in VenturEast Life Fund III \n(VenturEast Fund) in India, in each case not to exceed 25% of the total commitments with \nrespect to the fund and not resulting in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) being the largest \ninvestor in the fund. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n2.  The proposed equity investments comprise the equity component of ADB\u2019s Asia Climate \nChange and Clean Energy Venture Capital Initiative, which seeks to enhance the availability \nand affordability of technologies that address climate change mitigation and adaptation, and \nenvironmental protection (hereinafter referred to as \u2015climatech\u2016),1 as well as energy security, in \nAsia.2  Through this initiative, ADB proposes to invest $60 million of equity in aggregate in three \nventure capital funds, which were selected through a competitive process.  These funds will \ntarget  early-stage  climatech  ventures  operating  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs).3  The initiative will help to facilitate technology innovation, transfer, and diffusion, which \nis identified as one of they key building blocks to effecting the international climate change \nagenda as reflected in the Kyoto Protocol, 2007 Bali Action Plan, the Copenhagen Accord, and \nsubsequent agreements.  The initiative is also expected to establish (through separate Board \napproval) a technical assistance (TA) program to provide knowledge support to various funds in \nADB\u2019s DMCs (potentially including these three) on emerging market opportunities, technological \ncompetence and growth potential of investee companies, and intellectual property rights issues, \nso that they can allocate more of their fund resources to early-stage companies that lack access \nto capital, and to those technologies that contribute greatly to climate change mitigation and \nadaptation.  \n \nA.  Economic and Sector Background \n3.  Energy consumption in many of ADB\u2019s DMCs is growing extremely rapidly,4 raising \nconcerns about the region\u2019s vulnerability to resulting environmental degradation and fluctuations \n                                                \n1  Climatech is a term used to encompass the broad spectrum  of technologies that relate not only to clean \ntechnology, but to all technologies related to climate change and the environment.  Climatech includes a broad \nrange of technologies, such as:  (i) supply-side technologies related to renewable energy production and demand-\nside technologies related to energy efficiency (i.e. the \u2015cleantech\u2016 subset); (ii) non-energy related climate change \nmitigation technologies (such as those related to waste management, fertilizer production, and refrigeration); and \n(iii) climate change adaptation technologies (such as fresh water supply, flood protection equipment, agriculture \nproducts, and health care products for treatment of climate change-induced and/or exacerbated vector-borne \ndiseases).  The funds invested in through the initiative are anticipated to invest more than 67% of aggregate \ncommitments in companies primarily related to technologies included within the climatech rubric.   \n2  The initiative refers to the identification and investment process for climatech venture capital funds resulting from \nthese equity investments and the complementary TA.  It could potentially be extended via a second stage of the \nInitiative, if ADB identifies funds with potential, which are not ready for investment now, but to which ADB might \ncommit in the future if the fund managers mature adequately.   \n3  The term \u2015early-stage technology company\u2016 refers to an entity that has not yet reached a level of profitability on an \nannual basis.  Although these requirements will have some flexibility, approximately 75% of a fund\u2019s invested \ncapital is expected to be invested in early-stage technology companies for funds investing in the PRC and India.  \nWhere funds are investing in other DMCs, approximately 50% of a fund\u2019s invested capital is expected to be \ninvested in early-stage technology companies. \n4   According to the United States Department of Energy, strong economic growth in the PRC and India may push \ntheir share of world energy consumption to 28% by 2030, a two-fold increase since 2006. The demand for clean \nand energy-efficient products will expand along with energy usage. According to DnB NOR Markets Equity \nResearch, power generation in the PRC and India together is predicted to be about 46% of the total photovoltaic \ngeneration in the world in 2030. Similar predictions for wind power in these countries are only slightly less dramatic, \nat nearly 39% of world capacity.   ", "2 \nin energy prices, both of which often hurt the poor the most. An important means of assisting \ndeveloping countries in mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security is to improve \nthe availability and affordability of new low-carbon technologies. For this to happen, however, \nfinancing must be made available for climate change-related innovation. This entails a need to \nmobilize private capital, as public resources will be insufficient to finance innovation on the \nrequired scale.5 To that end, venture capital is one form of financing that could play a vital role in \nmeeting this need for investment, however it also is undercapitalized. In view of this, ADB has \nlaunched the equity component of the initiative. It aims to invest equity into multiple funds to \naccelerate the transfer and diffusion of climate change and environmental technologies via the \ninvestments the funds will make into climatech portfolio companies. \n \n4.   In addition to the equity investments, the initiative is expected to establish a capacity \ndevelopment TA facility, for which separate ADB Board approval will be sought by the Regional \nand Sustainable Development Department (RSDD). The purpose of the proposed TA is for \nADB\u2019s  DMCs  to  develop  subsectors  within  their  climatech  industry  that  need  support  in \nattracting more active participation of the fund managers. Specifically, the TA will retain a pool \nof experts to provide advice as requested on various aspects of the technology development \ncycle (e.g. research and development, production, intellectual property rights) especially in sub-\nsectors within the climatech industry where ADB\u2019s DMCs may not have active participation of \nfund managers, or where fund managers lack expertise. These experts, available on demand, \nare  expected  to  provide  support6  in  identifying  potential  investees  and  evaluating  new \ntechnologies and subsectors. The TA will coordinate closely with the regional departments of \nADB  to  identify  potential  large-scale  deployment  opportunities  for  promising  climatech \napplications.  \n \n5.   By embracing the ingenuity of the private sector in developing low-carbon technologies \nand products that might not otherwise make it to the market, ADB believes that the initiative\u2014\nwith its equity and knowledge components\u2014can help  DMCs address a number of severe public \nproblems, such as climate change, environmental degradation, energy security, and pollution-\nrelated health concerns. In the process, these efforts could offer a boost to a possible growth \nsector, thereby creating employment opportunities, reducing poverty, and spurring economic \ngrowth. \n \nB.  Investment Environment and Government Policy  \n \n6.  Regulatory status. The three funds proposed for investment will primarily target the \nmarkets of the PRC and India. Given the institutional environment for business development \nand venture capital fund operations, and the market conditions in the sectors targeted by the \nventure capital funds, both the PRC and India are environments conducive to allowing the \ngrowth and success of climatech venture capital. Policy interventions are essential in creating \nan environment within which climatech can effectively compete. The governments of the three \nfunds\u2019  target  countries are  actively  developing  mechanisms to  stimulate  clean  energy  and \nsustainable technologies.7 (Appendix 2 provides information on the investment environment and \ngovernment policies for climatech venture capital investing in the PRC and India.) \n \n \n                                                \n5  Recent estimates indicate that the mitigation financing needs of developing countries will grow to well over  \n$100 billion per year by 2020, depending on how ambitious the greenhouse gas emission reductions goals are. \nThe corresponding estimates for adaptation costs range from $75 billion to $100 billion per year. \n6 The primary aim of the TA is to develop the climatech sector in the DMCs \u2013 to the benefit of many funds, not just the \nthree being proposed for investment at this time.  Indeed, the selected fund managers already have the basic skills \nneeded for climatech investment assessment in-house.  However, to the extent that the fund managers of funds \nproposed in this equity investment have gaps in climatech sector expertise, the fund managers may avail of the TA.  \n7  RSDD has funded a consultant to research the investment environments and government policies in these \ncountries, and the related research paper is available as a supplemental appendix.   ", "3 \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n7.  The CFP and consequent selection of funds are broadly aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n20208 and climate change priorities, as well as the energy sector strategies of ADB and the \nDMCs targeted by the three proposed funds.   \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n8.  The funds selected through the CFP will make venture capital investments in climatech \ncompanies and projects in ADB\u2019s DMCs. As such, these fund investments are fully aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which has enshrined the environment, including climate change, as one \nof its five core operational priorities. Furthermore, the objective of the climatech investments \nmade by the three proposed funds is to address climate change and the environment through \ndevelopment and transfer of technologies. This aligns well with Strategy 2020\u2019s promotion of the \nuse  of  environment-friendly  technologies,  and  its  focus  on  transfer  of  knowledge  and \ntechnologies on environmental management. \n \n2.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s Climate Change Priorities   \n9.  The initiative is proposed to be implemented as part of ADB's emphasis on climatech \ntechnology transfer and diffusion, efforts that were strongly backed by the President's Advisory \nGroup  on  Climate  Change  and  Sustainable  Development  in  its  first  meeting  on  \n1 September 2009. To that end, ADB's realigned strategic agenda surrounding climate change, \nembodied in the Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific: Priorities for Action paper \napproved by the President on 27 April 2010, specifically states that ADB will move upstream in \nthe technology development process, in collaboration with governments, venture funds, and \nother partners, to facilitate the introduction of new clean energy technologies.  \n \n3.  Consistency with the Sector and Country Strategies \n10.  The investments in the three proposed funds are aligned with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy \n(2009), which seeks to facilitate a transition to a low-carbon economy and universal access to \nenergy as an important step toward achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free of poverty.9 The \ncountry partnership strategies (CPSs) for various DMCs (including the PRC and India, the two \nmain target DMCs for the three proposed funds) echo the themes of the Energy Policy, setting \ntargets for more environment-friendly energy mixes to improve energy security and ensure the \nsustainability of economic progress.   \n \n4.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n11.  Incubating  funds  takes  time  and  effort.  ADB  has  learned  lessons  from  its  past \ninvestments in five clean energy funds approved in 2008, four of which are now operating. ADB \nprovided  extended  assistance  to  these  funds  over  2  years  for  incubation  activities  and \nfundraising. Because the funds faced many challenges, ADB\u2019s consistent commitment and \nsupport was critical to their ultimate success in reaching financial closure. The lesson drawn \nfrom this experience was that a great deal of time and effort is needed to incubate first-time \nemerging market funds in an ongoing challenging fundraising environment, and ADB should \nmake  a  deliberate  choice  regarding  projects  where  this  expenditure  of  time  and  effort  is \nwarranted.   \n \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2008.

In  entering  new  markets  or  asset  classes,  established  managers  are  safer \npartners. Because it drew such a large volume of proposals, the CFP provided ADB the luxury \nof choice among established climatech venture capital fund managers in the PRC and India. As \na way to mitigate the risk associated with an asset class that is both relatively risky and \nrelatively new for ADB, ADB selected three of the highest caliber and most experienced fund \nmanagers  that  submitted  proposals.  None  is  a  first-time  manager,  and  all  three  have \nsuccessfully raised funds (for two of the three managers, multiple funds). Two of the three funds \nare well along in the fundraising process, and all three have established track records in \nclimatech investing. These three managers are seen as the most commercially viable managers \navailable in the market at this time, and this is viewed as an appropriate starting point for \ngaining exposure to a relatively new asset class.10 \n \nD.  Development Impact \n13.  Project  outputs  and  outcome.  The  key  output  of  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  the \nestablishment and/or funding of the selected venture capital funds, enabling their financing of \ntechnology start-up businesses focusing on climate change mitigation and adaptation, and \nenvironmental protection, in the DMCs. The fund investments in climatech companies and \nprojects, and the fund managers\u2019 ongoing management advice to those investees, will increase \naccess to finance and expertise for climatech companies and projects in the target regions \n(outcome).  \n \n14.  Impact.  The  ultimate  development  impact  of  the  proposed  investments  will  be \naccelerated innovation and diffusion of climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies, \nand environmental protection technologies, which will serve to make them more competitive and \naffordable in developing Asia. \n \nIII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES  \nA.  Aloe Environment Fund III \n1.  Sponsor and Ownership \n \n15.  Aloe Environment Fund III (Aloe Fund) will be established as a Mauritius company. The \ngeneral partner will be Green Investment Group, and the fund manager will be Aloe Private \nEquity, an established venture capital investment group and a pioneer in clean energy investing, \nwith expertise in transferring technologies from developed countries to the high-growth markets \nof Asia. Aloe Private Equity has operated since 2003, having managed two prior funds (plus a \nthird parallel fund established specifically for development finance institutions), and was one of \nthe earliest investors in environmental sustainability in the PRC and India. Aloe Private Equity \nhas offices in Beijing, London, Mumbai, and Paris.   \n \n2.  Governance Structure \na.  Management  \n16.  The  fund  manager  will  be  responsible  for  originating,  structuring,  and  negotiating \ntransactions;  making  recommendations  to  Aloe  Fund\u2019s  general  partner  with  regard  to  the \nacquisition  and  disposition  of  portfolio  investments;  monitoring  portfolio  investments;  and \nassisting  in  the  administration  of  capital  calls  and  distributions  to  investors,  and  investor \nreporting. The senior management team, which has operated together for 7 years, includes \n                                                \n10  Incubation of new funds is an appropriate role for ADB in circumstances where, for example, ADB wants to help \ndevelop a new asset class in which few managers exist and ADB does not have the luxury of choice among \nestablished managers. This was the case for this CFP with regard to particular geographies, such as Southeast \nAsia; in these regions, ADB may choose to incubate a climatech fund.   ", "5 \nindividuals  whose  backgrounds  combine  engineering  and  operating  experience  and  clean \ntechnology domain knowledge, along with a track record in venture capital in Asia and Europe \nand in clean technology transfer from developed markets to developing markets.  \n \n \nb.  Corporate Governance \n17.  Aloe Fund will have an advisory committee comprised of five members, including two \nrepresentatives of the fund manager and three investors, including ADB.   \n \nc.  Risk Management  \n18.  Aloe Private Equity will manage risk through its investment process, which involves \nmultiple steps and, in addition to the vote of the formal investment committee.  \n \n3.  Business Overview and Strategy \na.  Investment Objectives \n \n19.  Aloe  Fund\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  leverage  its  deep  climatech  sector  knowledge  to \ngenerate  attractive  financial  returns  by  making  venture  capital  investments  in  companies \nworking to sustain, restore, and improve the global environment; and to reduce, reuse, and \nrecycle natural resources. Aloe Fund will invest in Asian companies whose technologies can be \napplied to the markets of the PRC, India, and, potentially, countries in Southeast Asia. The \nfund\u2019s focus is to develop relationships between portfolio companies and their Asian-based \npartners with a particular emphasis on transferring technology and know-how.  \n \nb.    Investment Strategy \n \n20.  Aloe  Fund  seeks  to  actively  assemble  and  build  scalable  climatech  manufacturing \nbusiness models, built around proven climatech technology transferred from the west, which \ncan  be  adapted  to  the  local  environment  in  Asia.  Its  focus  sectors  include  clean  energy \n(biomass, biofuels, solar, wind, small hydro, transportation); waste recycling (plastics, batteries, \nelectrical waste, metals, paper); and eco-processes (resource-saving equipment and processes, \nenvironment-friendly air and water treatment), all of which have a large-scale positive impact on \ngreenhouse gas emission reductions and a cleaner, safer environment. The fund\u2019s patient, long-\nterm investment approach focuses specifically on transferring clean technologies (from Europe \nor other parts of the world) to early-stage companies in the clean technology sector in Asia.  \n \nB.  Keytone Ventures II \n1.  Sponsor and Ownership \n21.  Keytone Ventures II (Keytone Fund) will be a Cayman Islands exempted limited liability \npartnership. The general partner and fund manager will be Keytone Capital Partners II (Keytone \nor Keytone Ventures), a Cayman Islands limited partnership.  Formerly the Kleiner Perkins \nCaufield & Byers China Beijing team, Keytone is an experienced, well-known, and respected \ninvestment group that has operated since 2008. Keytone Fund seeks to replicate the strategy of \nits fully-invested $200 million Keytone Ventures Fund I, which engaged in disciplined venture-\nstyle  investing,  targeting  early-growth  companies  in  clean  technology,  technology,  and  the \nconsumer and media sectors in the PRC with manageable risks and venture-like returns.  \n \n \n \n ", "6 \n2.

The investment committee \ncomprises members with extensive experience in technology and venture capital investment \nmanagement. \n \n3.  Business Overview and Strategy \na.  Investment Objectives \n \n25.  Keytone Fund seeks to replicate the proactive investment strategy applied in its first \nfund, which is to invest primarily in early-stage companies in the cleantech, technology, and \nconsumer and media sectors in the PRC. This sector focus reflects Keytone\u2019s collective areas of \nstrength and what the Keytone team believes are potentially the most lucrative sectors offering \npromising  investment  opportunities,  driven  by  growing  spending  power  and  technological \ninnovations.       \n \nb.    Investment Strategy \n \n26.  Keytone  Fund  intends  to  follow  an  initiative-driven  investment  approach  where  the \nKeytone team will actively seek business opportunities along a given industry\u2019s value chain and \nendeavor to identify the best companies to capture such opportunities. Keytone will make \ninvestments  primarily  in  early-  and  early-growth-stage  companies  that  have  implemented \nproduct or business models, and that present reasonable visibility to become industry leaders.  \n \nC.  VenturEast Life Fund III \n1.  Sponsor and Ownership \n27.  VenturEast  Life  Fund  III  (VenturEast  Fund)  is  part  of  VenturEast\u2019s  fund  family, \ncomprising $170 million of assets under management, including two life science funds and two \ntechnology funds in India, all of which focus on venture-style investing. VenturEast Fund\u2019s \ninvestment advisor is VenturEast Mauritius Investment Advisors, which will manage VenturEast \nFund, and will in turn appoint APIDC Venture Capital, a company incorporated in India, as its \nsubadvisor  (VenturEast  Mauritius  Investment  Advisors  and  APIDC  Venture  Capital  jointly \nreferred to as VenturEast). VenturEast Fund will invest pro rata alongside a parallel investment ", "7 \ntrust, based in India, for domestic investors; however, this structure will be converted into a \nunified fund structure subject to regulatory approval. Together, the international and domestic \nfunds are targeting $200 million.    \n \n2.  Governance Structure \na.  Management  \n28.  VenturEast is an experienced investment group that has been operating since 1997 and \nis viewed as one the founders of the venture capital industry in India.

Corporate Governance \n29.  VenturEast Fund will have an advisory board comprising representatives of five limited \npartners, including ADB.  \nc.  Risk Management  \n30.  The fund manager will manage risk through its investment process, which involves \nseveral layers of approval, and through its investment committee, which comprises members \nwith extensive experience in life sciences and venture capital investment. \n \n3.  Business Overview and Strategy \na.  Investment Objectives \n31.  VenturEast Fund seeks to leverage the fund manager\u2019s life sciences platform and global \nnetwork of leading life science technology investors, and the management team\u2019s experience \nmaking venture-style investments in these sectors, to identify and invest in life sciences-driven \nclean  environment,  sustainable  agriculture,  and  health-care  businesses  in  India.  The  fund \nmanager will focus on investing in companies that seek to apply proven technologies from other \nregions, or scale up business models from other regions, in the Indian market. \n \nb.  Investment Strategy \n \n32.  VenturEast Fund expects to invest its committed capital in health care, sustainable \nagriculture, and clean environment. However, half of the deals in health care and sustainable \nagriculture will also fall within the parameters of climatech, as they will have a measurable \nimpact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. VenturEast Fund targets companies in India in \nclimatech  subsectors  that  contribute  to  a  cleaner,  safer  environment,  including  companies \nfocusing on efficiency improvement, waste management, and clean water production. It will \ngenerally  invest  in  rapidly  growing  companies  at  the  postrevenue,  proof  of  application,  or \nbusiness model stage (which would often be preprofit). They plan to seek business models that \ninclude  capitalizing  on  reengineered  product  innovations,  deploying  in  India  technologies \nderived from developed markets, or seeking to adapt existing business models from developed \nmarkets in the Indian context.     \n \n \n   \n \n ", "8 \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n33.  ADB\u2019s assistance is proposed to be $60 million (or equivalent) in aggregate, in the form \nof equity investments of $20 million (or equivalent) each in Aloe Fund, Keytone Fund, and \nVenturEast Fund.

The targeted size of VenturEast Fund is $200 million.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n37.  ADB is in a unique position to play a significant role in catalyzing greater investment into \nclimatech companies in Asia for a number of reasons: \n(i)  ADB can play a leadership role in climate change financing by addressing the \nfinancing gap for technology. \n(ii)  ADB  will  be  encouraging  generic  venture  capital  managers  to  enter  into \nclimatech venture capital (this is the case with Keytone Fund and VenturEast \nFund,  both  of  which  are  orienting  toward  climatech  as  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s \nencouragement through the CFP). \n(iii)  Other development finance institutions and institutional investors gain comfort \nfrom ADB\u2019s presence as an investor and will be encouraged to invest. \n(iv)  ADB,  as  a  substantial  investor  in  private  equity  funds  in  the  region,  has \ncoinvested with many of the key private equity fund investors from around the \nworld, which may be useful for the proposed funds in the creation of a diverse \ninvestor base. \n(v)  ADB can raise grant funds and combine its investments with TA and capacity-\nbuilding programs needed to develop expertise in the climatech sector (as is \nbeing proposed through the TA component of this initiative). \n(vi)  ADB has strong knowledge of its DMCs and their climate change agendas, and \nenjoys existing and historic relationships with DMC governments, including their \nrelated ministries. \n(vii)  ADB can structure public\u2013private partnerships, assume risk, and offer a range of \ncredit enhancement products to mobilize commercial debt; it can act regionally \nas well as country by country. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards   \n38.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  each  of  the  funds  will  be  classified  as  category  FI  (financial \nintermediary) under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The funds will each be required \nto  establish  and  implement  an  appropriate  environmental  and  social  management  system \n(ESMS) to ensure that its investee companies meet national laws and ADB requirements in the \ncountries in which these companies are located. ADB will coordinate with the respective fund \nmanagers to ensure that an ESMS satisfactory to ADB is adopted prior to disbursement for the \nfirst investment, and guide the fund managers in environmental and social safeguards due \ndiligence, monitoring, and reporting. (Appendix 5 provides a sample format for an ESMS, and \nAppendix 6 provides the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.)   ", "9 \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n39.  The three funds were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the funds\u2019 general partners, managers, and sponsors to institute, maintain, and comply \nwith internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the \npurpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism; \nand  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation between ADB and the  funds will allow ADB to  investigate any  violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \n40.  Aloe Fund will be a Mauritius company; the general partner and manager of Aloe Fund \nwill be Green Investment Group, also a Mauritius company. Keytone Fund will be a Cayman \nIslands exempted limited liability partnership; the general partner and fund manager of Keytone \nFund will be Keytone Capital Partners II, a Cayman Islands limited partnership. VenturEast \nFund is a Mauritius limited life company, as is VMIA, the fund\u2019s manager. The aforementioned \njurisdictions are offshore financial centers (OFCs)11 and common locations of incorporation for \nfunds and fund managers. Incorporation in an OFC allows a fund and its investors to avoid \ndouble taxation, as a result of the OFC\u2019s own tax regulations and the tax treaties that it has with \nother countries. Having undertaken its own due diligence of this matter, ADB is satisfied that \nthere is no reason to expect that the funds will be used for cross-border tax evasion, money \nlaundering, or the financing of terrorism. \n \nC.  Assurances \n41.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nthe Government of the PRC will be requested to confirm it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to Aloe Fund and Keytone Fund, and the Government of India will be requested to \nconfirm it has no objection to the proposed assistance to Aloe Fund and VenturEast Fund \nDepending on the final target countries in addition to PRC and India for the regional funds' \ninvestments, confirmations of no objection will be obtained from other DMC governments if and \nas required. Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB's Board of Directors, \nADB will enter into suitable documentation, in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.

The proposed equity investments comprise the equity component of the Asia Climate \nChange and Clean Energy Venture Capital Initiative of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \ninitiative seeks to enhance the availability and affordability of technologies that address climate \nchange  mitigation  and adaptation,  and  environmental  protection  (hereinafter  referred to  as \nclimatech),12 as well as energy security in Asia.13 Through this initiative, ADB proposes to invest \n$60 million of equity in aggregate in three venture capital funds, which were selected through a \ncompetitive process. These funds will target early-stage climatech ventures operating in ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs).14 The initiative will help facilitate technology innovation, \ntransfer, and diffusion, which is identified as one of they key building blocks to implementing the \ninternational climate change agenda reflected in the Kyoto Protocol, 2007 Bali Action Plan, the \nCopenhagen Accord, and subsequent agreements. The initiative is also expected to establish \n(through  separate  approval  of  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors)  a  complementary  technical \nassistance (TA) program to provide knowledge support to various funds (potentially including \nthese three) on emerging market opportunities, technological competence and growth potential \nof investee companies, and intellectual property rights issues, so that they can allocate more of \ntheir  fund  resources  to  early-stage  companies  that  lack  access  to  capital,  and  to  those \ntechnologies that contribute greatly to climate change mitigation and adaptation.      \n \nA.  Economic and Sector Background \n2.  Climate change and energy security. As the world continues to forge a new regime \nbeyond the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, Asia and the \nPacific  has  become  a  major  participant  in  the  global  climate  change  agenda.  Energy \nconsumption in many of the DMCs is growing extremely rapidly.15 Although their per capita \nemissions remain far lower than those of the developed world, many of these DMCs, with their \nlarge  populations,  fast  urbanization,  and  rapidly  growing  economies,  have  now  joined  the \nworld\u2019s largest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The region is highly vulnerable to the \nnegative impacts of climate change, with more people at risk than in any other region of the \nworld. Proactive efforts to mitigate the causes of global warming (mitigation) and help the most \nvulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change (adaptation), while helping to \ncurtail  environmental  degradation,  are  vital  to  continued  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive \n                                                \n12  Climatech is a term used to encompass the broad spectrum of technologies that relate not only to clean \ntechnology, but to all technologies related to climate change and the environment. Climatech includes a broad \nrange of technologies, such as (i) supply-side technologies related to renewable energy production and demand-\nside technologies related to energy efficiency (i.e., the cleantech subset); (ii) non-energy-related climate change \nmitigation technologies (such as those related to waste management, fertilizer production, and refrigeration); and \n(iii) climate change adaptation technologies (such as fresh water supply, flood protection equipment, agriculture \nproducts, and health care products for treatment of climate change-induced and/or exacerbated vector-borne \ndiseases). The funds invested in through the initiative are anticipated to invest more than 67% of aggregate \ncommitments in companies primarily related to technologies included within the climatech rubric.   \n13  The initiative refers to the identification and investment process for climatech venture capital funds resulting from \nthese equity investments and the complementary TA. It could potentially be extended via a second stage of the \ninitiative if ADB identifies funds with potential, but which are not ready for investment, to which ADB might commit \nin the future if the fund managers mature adequately.   \n14  The term \u2015early-stage technology company\u2016 refers to an entity that has not yet reached profitability on an annual \nbasis. Although these requirements will have some flexibility, approximately 75% of a fund\u2019s invested capital is \nexpected to be invested in early-stage technology companies for funds investing in the PRC and India. Where \nfunds are investing in other DMCs, approximately 50% of a fund\u2019s invested capital is expected to be invested in \nearly-stage technology companies. \n15    According to the United States Department of Energy, strong economic growth in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and India may push their share of world energy consumption to 28% by 2030, a two fold increase since \n2006. The demand for clean and energy-efficient products will expand along with energy usage. According to DnB \nNOR Markets Equity Research, power generation from photovoltaics in the People\u2019s Republic of China and India \ntogether is predicted to be about 46% of the total photovoltaic generation in the world in 2030. Similar predictions \nfor wind power in these countries are only slightly less dramatic, at nearly 39% of world capacity.   ", "14  Appendix 2 \neconomic growth in the region. A related and mounting global concern is energy security. Asia \nand the Pacific is particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices, as the majority of its \n1\ncountries have high energy intensity and are net importers of fossil fuels; as is the case with  4\n \nclimate change, this situation often hurts the poor the most, as energy price spikes have far-\nreaching effects on livelihoods.   A\np\n  p\ne\n3.  Need for dissemination of climatech solutions. An important means of assisting  nd\ndeveloping countries in mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security is to improve  ix 4\n \nthe  availability  and  affordability  of  new  low-carbon  technologies,  which  can  help  countries \nleapfrog the carbon-intensive phase of development that most developed countries experienced \nover the past century, and move directly to cleaner and more advanced energy solutions with \nlower GHG emissions. Transfer and diffusion of technology is one of the main pillars of the 2007 \nBali Action Plan, a landmark document that calls for long-term cooperative actions beyond \n2012.  The  2009  Copenhagen  Accord  took  the  Bali  Action  Plan  further  by  proposing  the \nestablishment of a mechanism to \u2015accelerate technology development and transfer in support of \naction on adaptation and mitigation.\u201616 \n \n4.  Need  for  investment  into  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation,  and \nenvironmental protection. The investment required to address climate change mitigation and \nadaptation  and  environmental  protection,  through  (among  other  means)  the  provision  and \ndissemination of new low-carbon technologies, is enormous. Recent estimates indicate that the \nmitigation financing needs of developing countries will grow to well over $100 billion per year by \n2020, depending on how ambitious the GHG emission reductions goals are. The corresponding \nestimates for adaptation costs range from $75 billion to $100 billion per year. Indeed, vast \nopportunities are emerging for businesses to benefit as early movers in climate change and \nenvironmental technologies (i.e., climatech), and to capitalize on the substantial policy support \nthat exists within and from outside Asia for the region to transition to low-carbon and climate-\nresilient growth. Beginning in the early 2000s, climbing fuel prices and growing public demand \nfor reducing energy costs and addressing climate change led to a convergence of social, \npolitical, economic, environmental, and entrepreneurial forces that are collectively driving the \ndevelopment of a broad-based climatech industry. For the sector to flourish, however, financing \nmust be made available for climate change-related innovation; this entails a need to mobilize \nprivate capital, as public resources will be insufficient to finance innovation on the required \nscale.   \n \n5.  Venture  capital  investment  in  clean  technology.  Venture  capital  is  one  form  of \nfinancing that could play a vital role in meeting this need for investment. According to the \nCleantech Group and Deloitte, clean technology venture capital investment in North America, \nEurope, India, and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) reached $7.77 billion in 2010, a 28% \nincrease from 2009, despite the economic slowdown and absence of a global climate change \naccord to replace the Kyoto Protocol. Further, Dow Jones VentureSource found that about 20% \nof all venture capital investment went to cleantech in 2010\u2014more than any other category, \nincluding software and biotechnology. With venture capital on the rise, the sector will likely \nwitness an upturn in initial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions in coming years. \nDespite these promising signs, Asia and the Pacific still lags North America and Europe in \naccessing  venture  capital  for  climatech.  Together,  the  PRC  and  India  accounted  for \napproximately 10% of total venture capital investment in clean technology in 2010, while North \nAmerica and Europe continue to attract the vast majority of venture capital.   \n \n6.  ADB equity investment through the initiative. The growth of climatech in Asia will \naccelerate once enough risk capital is available to capable entrepreneurs to allow them to \n                                                \n16  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change.  2009.

Multilateral development banks like ADB can play a vital role in the process by \nhelping to bridge the financing gaps in venture capital. In view of this, ADB has launched the \ninitiative, which will invest equity into multiple funds to accelerate the transfer and diffusion of \nclimate change and environmental technologies via the investments the funds will make into \nclimatech portfolio companies. The aim is to invest $60 million of ADB\u2019s resources in three \nproposed  funds,  to  leverage  a  total  of  $600  million\u2013$700  million  from  other  investors  for \npromising climatech start-ups in the DMCs.17 By enhancing the flow of financing to DMC-based \nenterprises in piloting, scaling up, or commercializing technology development, ADB and the \ninvestee  funds  will  help  address  the  binding  constraint  of  investment  needed  into  climate \nchange- and environment-related technologies.   \n \n7.  ADB technical assistance through the initiative. In addition to the equity investments, \nthe initiative is expected to establish a capacity development TA facility, for which separate ADB \nBoard  approval  will  be  sought  by  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department \n(RSDD). The purpose of the proposed TA is for ADB\u2019s DMCs to develop subsectors within their \nclimatech  industries  that  need  support  in  attracting  more  active  participation  of  the  fund \nmanagers.  Specifically, the TA will retain a pool of experts to provide advice as requested on \nvarious  aspects  of  the  technology  development  cycle  (e.g.,  research  and  development, \nproduction, intellectual property rights) especially in subsectors within the climatech industry \nwhere ADB\u2019s DMCs may not have active participation of fund managers or where those fund \nmanager have less direct experience. These experts, available on demand, are expected to \nprovide  support18  in  identifying  potential  investees  and  evaluating  new  technologies  and \nsubsectors.  The TA will coordinate with the regional departments of ADB to identify potential \nlarge scale deployment opportunities for promising climatech applications. \n \n8.  By embracing the ingenuity of the private sector in developing low-carbon technologies \nand products that might not otherwise make it to the market, ADB believes that the initiative\u2014\nwith its equity and knowledge components\u2014can help the DMCs address a number of severe \npublic problems, such as climate change, environmental degradation, energy security, and \npollution-related health concerns. In the process, these efforts could offer a boost to a possible \ngrowth  sector,  thereby  creating  employment  opportunities,  reducing  poverty,  and  spurring \neconomic growth. \n \nB.  Investment Environment and Government Policy  \n9.  Regulatory status. The three funds proposed for investment will primarily target the \nmarkets of the PRC and India, both of which are environments conducive to allowing the growth \nand success of climatech venture capital. The attractiveness of the investment environment for \nventure  capital  funds  in  these  countries  depends  on  several  key  factors.  The  first  is  the \ninstitutional environment for business development and venture capital fund operations, which \ndetermines the ease with which businesses can start up and access essential goods and \nservices, and the ease with which venture capital fund operations can be carried out. The \nsecond is the market conditions in the sectors targeted by the venture capital funds, which \ninclude technology demand and market size, and which, to a large degree, determine growth \npotential in key sectors. The third is the climatech policy environment, which is important in \ncreating incentives to invest in climatech, and markets for climatech products. Because the \nsector deals frequently with new technologies, climatech will frequently have a higher risk profile \n                                                \n17  This assumes that each fund would raise its target fund size of more than $200 million, for a total of more than  \n$600 million. \n18  The primary aim of the TA is to develop the climatech sectors in the DMCs\u2014to benefit many funds, not just the \nthree being proposed for investment at this time. Indeed, the selected fund managers already have the basic skills \nneeded for climatech investment assessment in-house. However, to the extent that the fund managers of funds \nproposed in this equity investment have gaps in climatech sector expertise, the fund managers may avail of the TA.  \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \nand higher costs than incumbent technologies. Policy interventions are therefore essential in \ncreating an environment within which climatech can effectively compete, thereby enabling the \n1\nwider adoption of these technologies. The governments of the three funds\u2019 target countries are  6\n \nactively developing mechanisms to stimulate clean energy and sustainable technologies.19  \n  A\n10.  People\u2019s Republic of China. The opportunity for climatech industries in the PRC is  p\np\ne\nsubstantial,  supported  by  a  long-term  government  policy  commitment  to  the  promotion  of  n\nd\ninvestment in the development and wider diffusion of climatech. The 12th Five Year Plan (2011\u2013 ix\n 4\n2015) adopts a target for the reduction of the energy intensity of gross domestic product of   \n40%\u201345% from 2005 by 2020. Various sectoral and local legislative, investment incentive, and \nregulatory programs support these high-level plans. Mandatory energy efficiency standards \nhave been introduced for a range of appliances such as air conditioners, refrigerators, computer \ndisplays, and washing machines. Building energy efficiency standards and incentives for the \npurchase and supply of green building materials have been adopted. In the transport sector, \nmore fuel-efficient vehicles enjoy preferential tax rates, and the purchase of electric and hybrid \nvehicles in some municipalities is subsidized. Renewable energy technologies enjoy a range of \nincentives, including substantial feed-in-tariffs, mandatory connection and off-take regulations \nfor utility companies, subsidies for the purchase of off-grid renewable technologies, tax relief on \nrenewable investments, and interest-free loans for eligible projects. In addition, decreases in \nsubsidies for fossil fuels and increases in end-user energy prices should support demand for \nenergy-efficient products. Water sector policy initiatives have similarly mandated increases in \nresource use efficiency. Supportive legislative changes have strengthened pollution controls \nand adopted fees for wastewater discharge, as well as concessional loans for wastewater \ntreatment projects.  \n \n11.  Research and development in climatech, including technologies in energy efficiency, \nenvironmental  protection,  new  energy,  biotechnology,  new  materials,  and  clean-energy \nvehicles, will be pursued through the 12th Five Year Plan via a number of tax breaks for \nresearch  and  development.  While  restrictions  on  capital  flows,  sectoral  restrictions  on \ninvestment, and sometimes bureaucratic and unpredictable administrative procedures do pose \nchallenges for venture capital fund operations, they are likely to be manageable. Increasing \nliberalization  of  markets  and  rapid  development  of  capital  markets  are  likely  to  facilitate \nclimatech venture capital fund exits through initial public offerings (IPOs) and third-party sales.  \n \n12.  India. India has adopted a range of long-term policy supports for climatech. Building on \nthe targets for the 11th Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012), the National Action Plan on Climate \nChange outlines legislative and investment programs, including the National Solar Mission, the \nNational Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, the National Mission on Sustainable Habitat, \nand  the  National  Water  Mission.  More  specifically,  in  support  of  sectoral  programs  for \nagriculture, households, and buildings, energy efficiency has been promoted by the introduction \nof  appliance  and  labeling  standards  for  a  range  of  items,  such  as  pumps,  motors,  air \nconditioners, and buildings above a certain size. Renewable energy, and in particular solar \nrenewables, is promoted through a range of aggressive measures, including feed-in-tariffs; \nmandatory renewables quotas; and connection requirements for utilities, tradable renewable \ncertificates for utilities, direct subsidies, concessional loans and tax breaks for renewables \nprojects,  and  tax  breaks  for  companies  involved  in  solar  photovoltaic  research  and \ndevelopment.  Renewables  use  in  transportation  is  being  promoted  by  an  ambitious  20% \nbiofuels  mixing  target  for  2020,  with  policy  support  including  subsidies,  tax  breaks,  and \nconcessional lending to biofuel projects. Policies to promote investment in water supply and \ntreatment include strengthened environmental protection legislation, legislation to encourage \nprivate  investment  in  water  supply  and  treatment,  and  strengthened  frameworks  for  the \ncollection of water fees.

The CFP and the selection of funds through it are broadly aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020 and climate change priorities, as well as the energy sector strategies of ADB and the \nDMCs targeted by the three proposed funds.   \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n14.  The funds selected through the CFP will make venture capital investments in climatech \ncompanies and projects in the DMCs. As such, these fund investments are fully aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which has enshrined environment, including climate change, as one of its \nfive core operational priorities. Strategy 2020 notes that \u2015only growth that is environmentally \nsustainable can eliminate poverty,\u2016 and states:  \n \nUnless approaches to economic growth are altered to address pollution, the destruction \nof natural resources, and environmental degradation (including climate change), the \nregion\u2019s  prospects  for  strong,  continuous  economic  progress  are  in  jeopardy. \nEnvironmental damage and resource depletion from fast growth are already impeding \nthe region\u2019s development and reducing the quality of life\u2014with the poor most severely \naffected. The Asian energy sector\u2019s share of global carbon dioxide emissions have more \nthan tripled from about 8% in 1980 to about 28% in 2005 (Appendix 1). The International \nEnergy Agency forecasts that the region\u2019s energy demand will double by 2015. The \nregion has the highest air pollution levels in the world, despite slight improvements in \nsome cities. Without greater efforts to safeguard the environment, pressure will continue \nto build on the region\u2019s land, forests, water systems, wetlands, marine ecosystems, and \nother natural resources upon which many of the poor depend for their livelihoods.

The objective of the climatech investments made by the three proposed funds is to \naddress climate change and the environment through development and transfer of technologies, \nwhich  aligns  well  with  Strategy  2020\u2019s  promotion  of  the  use  of  environment-friendly \ntechnologies,  and  its  focus  on  \u2015transfer  of  knowledge  and  technologies  on  environmental \nmanagement.\u2016 \n \n2.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s Climate Change Priorities   \n16.  The initiative is proposed to be implemented as part of ADB's recent emphasis on \nclimatech technology transfer and diffusion, one of the identified key building blocks under \ninternational climate change negotiations, to help address energy security and climate change \nin  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  Such  efforts  regarding  technology  were  strongly  backed  by  the \nPresident's  Advisory  Group  on  Climate  Change  and  Sustainable  Development  in  its  first \nmeeting on 1 September 2009. The advisory group, in its subsequent meeting on 2 February \n2010, again emphasized ADB's potential catalytic role and urged ADB to help the region shift to \nnew and improved technologies and move \"from the abstract to the concrete.\" \n \n                                                \n20  ADB. 2008.

ADB's  realigned  strategic  agenda  surrounding  climate  change,  embodied  in  the \nAddressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific: Priorities for Action paper approved by the \n1\nPresident on 27 April 2010, specifically states that ADB will move upstream in the technology  8\n \ndevelopment process, in collaboration with governments, venture funds, and other partners, to \nfacilitate the introduction of new clean energy technologies. Innovative financing, especially  A\np\nthrough public\u2013private partnerships, will be extended to address climate change adaptation  p\ne\nneeds. Because projects that employ new technologies often carry higher risks, ADB recognizes  nd\nthe need to extend incentives for the public and private sectors to invest in such projects. The  ix 4\n \npaper elaborates that as a part of this process, ADB will review how it assesses its own project \nrisks and determine whether adjustments can be made to increase support for technological \ninnovations in the climate change field. \n3.  Consistency with the Sector and Country Strategies \n18.  Although clean energy is only one subsector within the broader area of climatech, it is a \nlarge and important subsector, comprising, among other things, renewable energy, energy \nefficiency, and clean technology. The investments in the three proposed funds are aligned with \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy (2009), which seeks to facilitate a transition to a low-carbon economy and \nuniversal access to energy as an important step toward achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free \nof poverty.21 The objective of the Energy Policy is to help DMCs provide reliable, adequate, and \naffordable  energy  for  inclusive  growth  in  a  socially,  economically,  and  environmentally \nsustainable way. It emphasizes energy efficiency and renewable energy; access to energy for \nall;  and  energy  sector  reforms,  capacity-building,  and  governance.  The  particular  country \npartnership strategies (CPSs) for various DMCs (including the PRC and India, the two main \ntarget DMCs for the three proposed funds) echo the themes of the Energy Policy, setting targets \nfor  more  environment-friendly  energy  mixes  to  improve  energy  security  and  ensure  the \nsustainability of economic progress.22,23  \n \n19.  To achieve these objectives, policy implementation will be based in part on private \nsector  participation  (and  public\u2013private  partnerships)  to  improve  energy  sector  efficiency \nthrough  competition  and  an  increase  in  investable  resources  in  DMCs.  ADB  and  other \nmultilateral development organizations have poured capital into this sector through public sector \nloans and other financing mechanisms for clean energy and clean technology. However, the \ninvestment  has  been  insufficient  to  build  and  sustain  the  increasingly  energy-intensive \n                                                \n21  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n22  In its CPS, the PRC recognizes the need to improve its energy efficiency and redefine its energy mix toward a \nmore environment-friendly combination. The country\u2019s goals, as outlined in the CPS, include (i) ensuring resource \nefficiency and environmental sustainability by adopting clean and efficient energy, among other important sector-\nspecific platforms; and (ii) creating an enabling environment for private sector development through private sector \nfinancing and other interventions needed to increase private sector participation in the country\u2019s development \nactivities. The CPS emphasizes that increasing private sector involvement would address certain funding gaps and \ninvestment needs in the country, and would complement the (relatively limited) public sector funds dedicated to \ninfrastructure, including clean energy. \n23 India's CPS for 2009\u20132012 emphasizes the urgent need to carry out energy infrastructure projects to meet the \npower requirements of the next decades. At present, rural household electrification is still at about only 33% \ncoverage, and the quality of power remains poor due to \"(i) insufficient power generation capacities in these areas, \n(ii) lack of optimum utilization of the generation capacity, (iii) an inadequate and aging sub-transmission and \ndistribution network, (iv) large-scale theft and a skewed tariff structure, (v) the slow pace of rural electrification, and \n(vi) inefficient use of electricity by the consumers.\" These challenges are seen to plague the country's energy \nsecurity and the sustainability of economic progress. Thus, together with ADB, India has established an energy \nsector results framework within its strategy and developed ambitious overall target outcomes, such as (i) the \naddition of at least 70 megawatts of solar power generation, (ii) the addition of at least 982 megawatts of \nhydropower  generation,  and  (iii)  the  building  of  an  efficient  power  transmission  network.  The  strategy \nacknowledges the importance of a greater role for the private sector in realizing these goals through funding of \nsome of the needed infrastructure.

The private sector must fill the \ngap by allocating financial resources and technical expertise for clean energy and climatech \nbusinesses in the DMCs. \n \n4.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n20.  Incubating funds takes time and effort. ADB has learned from experience investing in \nclean energy funds. In 2008, ADB approved investments in five clean energy funds, selected \nthrough a CFP, four of which are operating. One of the five funds withdrew from the market \nentirely due to ongoing fundraising difficulties, while two others took over 2 years of fundraising \nto reach a first closing. This was due to the financial crisis prevailing since mid-2008, and in part \nto the basic challenges facing many first-time emerging markets fund managers. ADB provided \nextended  assistance  to  these  funds  over  2  years  in  incubation  activities  and  fundraising; \nbecause the funds faced many challenges, ADB\u2019s consistent commitment and support was \ncritical to their ultimate success in reaching financial closure.  The lesson drawn from this \nexperience was that a great deal of time and effort is needed to incubate first-time emerging \nmarkets funds in an ongoing challenging fundraising environment, and ADB should make a \ndeliberate choice regarding projects where this expenditure of time and effort is warranted.   \n \n21.  In  entering  new  markets  or  asset  classes,  established  managers  are  safer \npartners. Because it drew such a large volume of proposals, the CFP provided ADB the luxury \nof choice among established climatech venture capital fund managers in the PRC and India. As \na way to mitigate the risk associated with an asset class that is both relatively risky and \nrelatively new for ADB, ADB selected three of the highest caliber and most-experienced fund \nmanagers that submitted proposals. None of the three is a first-time manager, and all three \nhave successfully raised funds (for two of the three managers, multiple funds). Two of the three \nfunds are well along in the fundraising process, and all three have established track records in \nclimatech investing. These three managers are seen as the most commercially viable managers \navailable in the market at this time, and this is viewed as an appropriate starting point for \ngaining exposure to a relatively new asset class.24  \n                                                \n24  Incubation of new funds is an appropriate role for ADB to play in circumstances where, for example, ADB wants to \nhelp develop a new asset class in which few managers exist and ADB does not have the luxury of choice among \nestablished managers. This was the case for this CFP with regard to particular geographies, such as Southeast \nAsia; in these regions, ADB may choose to incubate a climatech fund.   \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20110608153221Z", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Keywords": "equity investments, climatech venture capital funds, aloe environment fund, keytone ventures, ventureast life fund, asia climate change and clean energy venture capital initiative, adb equity investments, climate change, adb project 44945 ", "ModDate": "D:20110609094219+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Subject": "Report and recommendation of the President describing terms and conditions on proposed equity investments in climatech venture capital funds in Aloe Environment Fund III, Keytone Ventures II in the PRC, and VenturEast Life Fund III in India.", "Title": "RRP: Regional: Proposed Equity Investments in Climatech Venture Capital Funds - REG: Aloe Environment Fund III; PRC: Keytone Ventures II; IND: VenturEast Life Fund III "}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  CFP  \u2013  call for proposals \n  CPS  \u2013  country partnership strategy \n  DMC  \u2013  developing member country \n  ESMS  \u2013  environmental and social management system \n  FI  \u2013  financial intermediary \n  IPO  \u2013  initial public offering \n  IRR  \u2013  internal rate of return \n  OFC  \u2013  offshore financial center \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n  PSOD  \u2013  Private Sector Operations Department  \n  RSDD  \u2013  Regional and Sustainable Development Department \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  US  \u2013  United States \n  VMIA  \u2013  Ventureast Mauritius Investment Advisor \n \nNOTE \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nVice-President  L.
