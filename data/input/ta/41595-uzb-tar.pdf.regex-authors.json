The Government of Uzbekistan requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support present and planned policy and institutional reforms over \nthe  next  3  years.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Uzbekistan  on  3-10  August  2007  and \nreached an understanding with relevant government agencies on the objective, scope, and \nimplementation arrangements of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  geographic  location  in  the  heart  of  Central  Asia  allots  it  significant \ngeopolitical importance and a critical role in regional and global integration. Also possessing \ngreat social and economic development potential, Uzbekistan has adopted a policy of gradual \ntransition from a planned to a market economy. During the initial development stage after its \nindependence, the country\u2019s economic slump was less severe than those of other Central Asian \ncountries,  and  recovery  to  its  pre-independence  level  was  faster.  This  phenomenon  was \npartially due to low industrialization, its cotton production, and self-sufficiency in energy.2 \n \n3.  The  country\u2019s  economy  has  demonstrated  3  consecutive  years  of  strong  growth, \nsupported by accelerated exports, productivity gains in the agriculture sector, remittances from \noverseas workers, and favorable commodity prices. Due to the Government's conservative \nfiscal stance, the state budget marked a surplus in 2006. However, Uzbekistan\u2019s economic \ngrowth has not reached its real potential, and its economy heavily relies on the few primary \nsectors. Furthermore, competition within the region and beyond has recently been intensified.  \n \n4.  In August 2007, the Government approved the Welfare Improvement Strategy (WIS),3 a \nmedium-term  development  strategy  for  2008\u20132010.  The  WIS\u2019s  main  objectives  include  (i) \nsecuring highly sustainable economic growth complemented by increased employment and \nincome generation capacity, (ii) creating favorable conditions by attracting private investment to \nsectors that impact growth and vulnerable populations, (iii) achieving comprehensive regional \ndevelopment within the country that corresponds to each region\u2019s resources, (iv) increasing the \nquality of and access to basic social services and encouraging gender equality, (v) deepening \nstructural  and  institutional  reforms  and  increasing  the  economy\u2019s  competitiveness  through \nliberalization  and  development  of  the  financial  sector  and  the  strengthening  of  market \ninstitutions, and (vi) accelerating reforms in the public administration sector to boost efficiency of \npolicy formulation and transmission mechanisms and to enhance public goods and service \nquality. \n \n5.  The WIS\u2019s successful implementation requires continued government commitment to \nreforms.  There  is  also  a  need  to  develop  coherent  policies  and  strategies  that  can  be \noperationalized\u2014and adjusted if necessary\u2014to help achieve the WIS\u2019s objectives.  \n \n6.  The Government has initiated several important reforms aimed at strengthening the \npublic finance sector and creating favorable conditions for private sector investment. Although \nthese efforts have yielded positive results, more structural and institutional changes are needed \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 August 2007. \n2  Zettelmeyer, Jeromin. 1999.

Tashkent.  \n ", "2   \nto sustain growth in sectors such as agriculture, international trade, and infrastructure. However, \nthough some of these initiatives seem effective from each sector\u2019s perspective, they do not \ncorrespond cohesively across sectors. There is no mechanism to identify and analyze linkages \nbetween different reform policies and their effects on the country\u2019s overall development. In \naddition, no effective platform exists to facilitate discussion and the timely analysis of policy \noptions among stakeholders or even decision-makers. Finally, even though Uzbekistan may \npossess adequate capacity to conduct analytical work for policy reforms, this capacity is not \nconsolidated\u2014it is scattered among various ministries, government-affiliated think tanks, and \nresearch institutions. These issues combined emphasize the need to develop mechanisms that \ncan effectively use local capacity to help facilitate dialogue between experts and policy-makers. \n \n7.  This proposed TA aims to address these issues in the following sectoral and thematic \nareas identified by the Government and ADB in line with the country\u2019s demand and capacity: (i) \nspecialized economic zones; (ii) microfinance facility; (iii) macroeconomic policy and public \nfinance reform; (iv) natural resources, e.g., agriculture extension, land use, and water; and (v) \nother issues relevant to ongoing reforms. Of these areas, the proposed TA will commence with \npolicy analysis related to the specialized economic zone and impact on improved seed quality \nfor sustainable agriculture. ADB will define other issues to be addressed with the implementing \nagencies (IAs) on a demand-driven basis. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be to enhance policy formulation capacity and to accelerate the \nreform process to a market-oriented economy. The outcomes of the TA will include developing \nmechanisms to facilitate analysis of various policy options, strengthening capacity for long-term \nstrategic  thinking  for  sustainable  growth,  stimulating  policy  dialogue,  and  disseminating \ninformation to the public. The proposed TA will support high-level policy dialogue on reform \nagendas regarding economic, socioeconomic, natural resource, and institutional constraints \nbased on sound policy analysis in priority areas. It will facilitate building multi-stakeholder \npartnerships through conducting these needed and timely analyses. Findings from the analyses \nwill  be  disseminated  at  workshops,  seminars,  and  conferences  within  and  outside  of  the \ncountry.  \n \n9.  Further, the proposed TA will enhance national capacity to conduct analyses and to \nimplement reforms aided by (i) economic, social, and private sector updates, (ii) additional \ninstitutional  and  organizational  assessments,  and  (iii)  participatory  development  of  various \npolicy agendas by  government  officials; researchers at  think tanks, research centers,  and \nuniversities; and participants from the private sector and civil society. Relevant reform issues \nwill be identified in a highly participatory manner to ensure government ownership of outputs. \nDissemination of findings and policy suggestions will also be emphasized. \n \n10.  The proposed TA is designed to produce four types of outputs:  \n \n(i)  policy review and analysis in prioritized thematic areas that include identified \nreform agendas, outputs in publishable quality, and selected reform road maps \nand action plans if applicable; \n(ii)  platform  and  associated  networks  between  the  Government  and \nstakeholders, including development partners, for reforms in identified thematic \n ", "  3\nareas  through  focused  policy  discussions  in  meetings,  seminars,  and \nconferences, and invitation of international experts in open discussions;  \n(iii)  policy retreats with the policy-makers in which stakeholders discuss policy \nreform issues based on findings from analyses; and \n(iv)  dissemination  of  information  and  provision  of  findings  from  analyses \nthrough  official  government  publications,  ADB  publication  series,  conference \nparticipation, and publication in peer-reviewed journals. \n \n11.  The proposed TA also will assist the Government in reform initiatives stipulated in the \nWIS. In order to ensure demand-driven processes and government ownership of the outputs, \nthe TA\u2019s design is flexible in providing timely responses to the Government\u2019s requests. Its \nimplementation scheme is also adaptable, so that the TA can immediately respond to emerging \nissues that the Government may encounter during its reform over the next 3 years. ADB will \nalso engage local institutions so that the TA enhances local ownership of outputs. The TA will \nhelp contribute to knowledge accumulation on reform agendas and capacity building for local \nresearchers and policy practitioners. It will also develop mechanisms to discuss reform issues \ncohesively and comprehensively, and its outputs will help to formulate a long-term strategy. \nDuring the TA\u2019s implementation, its activities will be closely coordinated with the Central Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  Institute  (CAREC)  in  order  to  enhance  results  and  avoid \nduplication of work.  \n \n12.  The proposed TA will also coordinate policy researchers in drawing on international best \npractices  and  experiences  from  relevant  transitional  economies.  It  will  commission  policy \nreviews  and  analyses  in  highly  relevant  reform  areas,  finance  policy  retreats,  convene  \nin-country conferences with international experts, and support local researchers in presenting \nthe results from policy reviews and analyses at international conferences and workshops. The \nTA  will  also  finance  policy  practitioners  to  participate  in  international  conferences  and \nworkshops on policy analysis. It will create a government-oriented research network that draws \non international economic reform best practices. The knowledge base for this network will be \nbuilt during the TA\u2019s implementation, and the TA will provide the repository of reform knowledge \nand expertise.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA seeks to (i) improve the analytical underpinning of sectoral policies, and (ii) \nassist in the development of a coherent, prioritized, and budgeted implementation strategy for \nthe WIS. These actions include strengthening institutional arrangements for policy analysis \ncoordination and implementation. The analytical framework will be guided by the WIS and \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for Uzbekistan.4 The TA will adopt a highly participatory \napproach that will include the facilitation of dialogue among policy-makers and stakeholders, \nincluding the Government, nongovernment organizations, civil society organizations, and private \nsector representatives. If any similar study was conducted in neighboring countries, associated \nresearchers will be invited to present their findings. International and national consultants will be \nengaged  whenever  feasible  to  strengthen  domestic  policy  formulation  capacities,  national \nconsultation workshops will review the TA\u2019s findings, and the findings will be presented at local \nand international workshops and conferences. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

To  ensure  national \nleadership and ownership, the TA will convene demand-driven and outcome-oriented policy \nretreats for policy-makers based on results from the analyses. Policy retreats will also help \nidentify key institutional reforms and capacity development priorities to enable effective and \nsustainable market reform. \n \n15.  Findings from the analyses and conclusions from policy retreats, if applicable, will be \ndisseminated through all available channels, including but not limited to official publications, \nADB publications, e-publications, and peer-reviewed journals. The proposed TA will finance \nstakeholders\u2019  participation  in  international  conferences  to  reach  wider  audiences  and  the \ninvitation of international researchers and policy practitioners to open discussions. Through \ndissemination of findings and continuing dialogue on reform issues, the TA will provide guidance \nto  the  Government  in  enhancing  implementation  of  its  reform  agenda  and  rebuilding \npartnerships with stakeholders, e.g., research institutions, private sector entities, civil society \norganizations, and development partners.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent, of which $800,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government has agreed to provide \nthe balance of $150,000 equivalent in-kind, through counterpart staff, office space, furniture, \nadministrative  support  services,  and  local  logistics.  The  details  of  the  cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Executing Agency. The Executing Agency (EA) is the United Information\u2013Analytical \nDepartment on Economy and External Economic Relations, Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic \nof Uzbekistan. The EA will coordinate all TA activities, and ADB will monitor the progress of TA \nimplementation.  \n \n18.  Implementing Agencies. Each IA will be identified depending on the thematic issues \nand established at relevant ministries, think tanks, research centers, and universities. IAs will \nconduct  the  analyses  with  the  consultants  under  ADB  supervision.  If  applicable,  IAs  will \norganize expert technical workshops, policy retreats, policy reform seminars, and participatory \nstakeholder consultations. All documentary outputs of the TA will be under the joint ownership of \nthe Government and ADB. \n \n19.  The EA, IAs, and ADB will be responsible for TA implementation. The TA task manager, \nan ADB staff member, will be responsible for coordinating with the EA and submitting the \nproposed schedule, detailed terms of reference, and budget for each thematic area. The EA will \nbe responsible for managing the updates of TA implementation and the reform policy briefs.  \n \n20.  Procurement. Any procurement under the TA will be conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Procurement will be \nconducted by ADB, and all equipment will be turned over to the counterpart agencies upon \ncompletion of the TA. \n \n21.  Consulting Services. ADB will recruit international consultants and team leaders (14 \nperson-months) and national consultants (50 person-months), whose expertise fits the thematic \nareas identified by the EA. ADB will engage four international consultants and two national \n ", "  5\nconsultants per international consultant. Facilitators (international, 1 person-month and national, \n5  person-months)  will  be  recruited  for  the  policy  retreats  and  various  conferences  and \nworkshops. Russian and English language interpreters (national, 1 person-month), and Russian \nlanguage translator (national, 1 person-month) will be recruited on an intermittent basis to guide \nreport preparation, presentation, and dissemination of results to local stakeholders. Editors \n(international,  1  person-month,  and  national,  2  person-months)  will  be  recruited  on  an \nintermittent basis to finalize publication of TA findings for wide readership. ADB will engage the \nconsultants on an individual basis in accordance with ADB's procedures for recruitment of \nindividual consultants. Engaging individual consultants are more appropriate than firms because \nthe assignments do not require a team of experts across different disciplines. Policy analysis for \neach  thematic  area  will  be  conducted  by  a  team  of  one  international  and  two  national \nconsultants,  and  the  EA  as  well  as  ADB  will  supervise  TA  activities  throughout  TA \nimplementation. The terms of reference are provided in Appendix 3. The TA is expected to be \ncompleted by the end of June 2010. \n \n22.  The  TA  consultants  will  organize  policy  retreats  and  national  and  international \nworkshops and conferences, preparing detailed objectives, programs, and budgets for each \nevent. Proposals for retreats, workshops, and conferences will be submitted to ADB at least 6 \nweeks in advance for review and approval. Participants of retreats, workshops, and tours will be \nnominated by the EA at least 1 month before those events are scheduled to occur, and all \nnominations will be subject to ADB approval.  \n \nIV.
