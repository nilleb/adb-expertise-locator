The  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  has  requested  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening of \nthe Ministry of Infrastructure and Development (MID).  \n \n2.  On  government  request,  a  mission1  visited  Solomon  Islands  from  28  October  to  6 \nNovember 2003 to review the scope of the Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project \n(PCERP) and initiate fact-finding. A fact-finding mission2 was then undertaken from 10 to 17 \nFebruary  2004  to  assess  MID\u2019s  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  a  range  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment  activities expected  in  the  near  term,  and  to  determine  the  scope  of  the  TA. \nFindings of these missions, in the form of the draft TA paper, have been discussed with the \nGovernment, which agreed with the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference. \n \n3.  The goals and objectives of this TA complement the Solomon Islands Country Strategy \nand Program Update 2005\u20132006, which aims to achieve rapid, pro-poor and private sector-led \neconomic  growth  through  (i)  providing  transport  infrastructure  and  services,  and  (ii) \nstrengthening the enabling environment for the private sector, both with a focus on capacity \nbuilding and promotion of good governance.  \n \n4.   The  TA  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  framework  set  out  in  the  National \nEconomic  Recovery,  Reform  and  Development  Plan  2003\u20132006  (NERRDP).  The  TA  will \nparticularly complement the focus on transport within Key Strategic Area 4 on Revitalizing the \nProductive Sector and Rebuilding the Supporting Infrastructure, by building capacity to complete \nthe National Transport Plan, create a transport policy and planning unit, and establish a national \ntransport fund. Appendix 1 gives the TA framework.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Economic and social development in Solomon Islands has long centered around the \ncapital  of  Honiara  on  the  island  province  of  Guadalcanal,  where  many  people  from  other \nprovinces have long migrated for better opportunities. Over time, the pressure of economic \ncompetition has raised tensions between migrants and the local population. Tensions grew into \nviolent conflict by mid-1999 and resulted in the displacement of the elected government in mid-\n2000. The result has been loss of lives, major property damage, large displacement of people, \nand extensive damage to transport infrastructure, schools, water supplies, sanitation systems, \ngovernment buildings, and health centers. Damage to the economic and social infrastructure\u2014\nestimated  at  more  than  SI$200  million,  equivalent  to  20%  of  the  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)\u2014has disrupted economic activity and severely strained delivery of government services.  \n \n6.  During and after the crisis, MID undertook virtually no maintenance. Roads, wharves and \nairstrips, as well as government workshops and equipment, all deteriorated to such an extent \nthat most facilities are beyond maintenance and require total reconstruction. The crisis severely \naffected the productive operations of the private sector, which in key areas of Solomon Islands \ncame  to  a  total  halt,  and  contributed  to  a  massive  decline  in  formal  employment,  a  50% \nreduction in exports and a precipitous fall in national income.   \n                                                 \n1  Comprising R. Adhar, senior project implementation officer and mission leader. \n2  Comprising R. Guild, transport specialist-mission leader; and R. Adhar, senior project implementation officer. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 March 2004.  ", "2 \n \n7.  Hostilities ceased in late 2000. An elected government was returned in December 2001, \nbut faced severe revenue problems caused by massive decline in the economy. Thus, the \nGovernment\u2019s ability to maintain minimum social services was severely affected, and it incurred \nmassive payment arrears to international and domestic creditors. ADB suspended the PCERP \nloan in February 2002, considering the poor security situation and after continuing default of \nrepayment of past loans. \n \n8.  In the face of a potential collapse, the Government sought outside assistance to restore \nlaw and order. In July 2003 the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), \nled by Australia with representatives from most member countries of the Pacific Islands Forum, \narrived in Honiara with military and administrative support to restore the public sector and \nstabilize  government  finances.  In  September  2003,  the  Australian  Government  settled  the \nGovernment\u2019s  outstanding  arrears  to  ADB,  allowing  resumption  of  ADB  operations  and \nassistance. \n \n9.  Development partners, including ADB, are now resuming operations, and significant \nfinancial resources are becoming available for rehabilitation, investment, and maintenance.  \nAlthough no new lending is expected in the short term, ADB has reactivated the PCERP loan at \nthe Government\u2019s request. Other development partners also expect to resume infrastructure \ndevelopment projects, including rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads, bridges, schools, \nwharves, and utilities; support to inter-island shipping; and improvement of aviation facilities.   \n \n10.  It has become apparent, however, that MID has neither sufficient capacity to plan and \nmanage its own activities nor the necessary planning framework to coordinate the large volume \nof development assistance expected. Years of conflict and resource constraints forced the \nGovernment to eliminate all but emergency services. Civil servants were retrenched to reduce \nthe payroll, and few junior officers are available for training to replace them. Only two civil \nengineers are available in MID\u2019s Roads Division, and both are at the senior management level. \nIn the Marine Division, the superintendent has been in the post less than 1 year, but support \nstaff  are  nearing  retirement.  The  post  of  director  of  the  Civil  Aviation  Division  is  vacant. \nTechnically  qualified  staff  are  available  in  some  areas,  but  there  has  been  a  freeze  on \nrecruitment and an ongoing inability to fund established positions. \n \n11.  Significant  challenges,  therefore,  face  MID  in  planning,  rebuilding,  and  maintaining \ntransportation  infrastructure.  In  the  past,  the  Government  maintained  a  reasonably  strong \ncapability to carry out design and construction activities directly, using in-house resources. But \nthose resources have been significantly depleted. A major investment in vehicles, plant and \nmachinery, and permanent employment of a large number of technically skilled people would be \nrequired to re-establish a functioning direct works capacity. Therefore, MID plans to move away \nfrom  direct  provision  of  works,  and  to  asset  management  and  private  sector  contracting, \nallowing it to concentrate on policy development, regulation, asset management, and contract \nadministration with the limited professional staff that can be expected to be available on a \nsustainable basis. \n \n12.  NERRDP  sets  the  Government\u2019s  policy  framework.  Under  key  strategic  area  4, \nRevitalizing the Productive Sector and Rebuilding the Supporting Infrastructure, a focus for \ntransport infrastructure is set out that includes: \n \n(i)  adopting and implementing a national transport sector strategy; ", "    3 \n(ii)  continuing implementation of an inter-island shipping project including appraising \nproject profiles for the Provincial Shipping Services Assistance Fund; \n(iii)  continuing implementation of the marine infrastructure project; \n(iv)  finalizing the Shipping Act, Revised Road Act, and National Transport Fund;  \n(v)  continuing to implement a national maintenance regime;  \n(vi)  formulating medium-term infrastructure development programs; and \n(vii)  reforming and building MID\u2019s capacity. \n \n13.  MID now lacks the tools and personnel to guide this process, including capacity for \nstrategic  planning,  management  of  assets  and  finances,  procurement,  and  contract \nadministration.  Institutional  strengthening  is  required  to  carry  out  reforms,  design  national \npolicies, and create sustainable funding mechanisms for implementation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The purpose of the TA is to strengthen MID\u2019s institutional capacity to effectively plan, \nmanage, and finance infrastructure development in Solomon Islands in a sustainable manner by \nproviding training and assistance to counterpart staff in developing requisite skills. The outputs \nwill be:  \n \n(i)  two professional MID staff trained in transport planning and economics; \n(ii)  two professional MID staff trained in procurement and contract administration; \n(iii)  a National Transport Plan (NTP) prepared; \n(iv)  a transport policy and planning unit (TPPU) established; \n(v)  a National Transport Fund (NTF) established;  \n(vi)  a contract procedures manual prepared; and \n(vii)   MID staff and private sector contractors trained in tendering procedures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  A  structured  planning  and  management  framework  is  necessary  to  ensure  that \ndomestic and external resources give the maximum positive developmental impact. Previous \nassistance from development partners has produced numerous study reports, but none provide \ndetailed  implementation  guidance.  Thus,  the  TA  methodology  is  to  help  MID  update  and \nsupplement  existing  knowledge  and  convert  it  into  action  plans  that  can  be  realistically \nimplemented, within an appropriate institutional setting that will ensure ongoing capacity. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  address  the  institutional  constraints  that  the  Government  faces  in \ndeveloping the three major modes of transport: land, sea, and air. It will encompass training \nand  counterpart  support  in  (i)  strategic  planning  and  policy  development,  (ii)  asset \nmanagement, (iii) project management, (iv) financial management, and (v) procurement.   \n \n17.  The TA will provide formal and on-the-job training and assistance in the required tasks \nof developing the NTP and establishing the TPPU. Training will include review and synthesis of \nexisting  documentation,  creation  of  new  institutional  structures  and  procedures,  and \nengagement  in  ongoing  operations  that  are  expected  to  be  part  of  each  staff  member\u2019s \nresponsibilities in parallel with TA activities. \n ", "4 \n18.  The TA will establish the NTF with specialized technical assistance from the European \nUnion (EU) Project Management Unit. EU is expected to fund and supervise a specialist to \ndesign  financial  management  provisions  of  NTF.  The  ADB-financed  TA  team  will  be \nresponsible  for  policy  and  institutional  aspects  of  establishment  and  integration  of  NTF \noperations through the TPPU. \n \n19.  To support private sector participation in infrastructure provision, a draft manual on \ncontract procedures will be produced at the beginning of the consultant services as the basis of \nsubsequent training of MID staff and local contractors. On-the-job training is essential to the \nprocess;  trainees  will  participate  in  management  of  procurement  activities  and  contract \nadministration. This hands-on involvement means that training will be most effective if spread \nover the entire project cycle, with mentoring by visiting specialists. \n \n20.  The TA will provide additional training and support through association with a partner \nagency  that  will  provide  (i)  professional  work  experience  for  MID  staff  on  short-term \nsecondment, (ii) access to documentation and resources, and (iii) technical backup to respond \nto MID staff requests for information. The partner agency will also help the project team identify \noverseas training opportunities for MID staff.  \n \n21.  The TA team, consisting of consultants and MID staff, is expected to work closely with \ndevelopment partners that now finance most capital works in Solomon Islands to ensure that \ncurrent  and  future  projects  are  incorporated  into  the  NTP.  Specific  ongoing  or  expected \nprojects include the PCERP project, the EU outer islands wharves project, and the Japan \nbridge construction project. These projects will also give MID staff opportunities for on-the-job \ntraining with TA supervision.  \n \n22.  The TA team is expected to work closely with other government agencies\u2014particularly \nthe Ministry of Finance, the Department of National Reform and Planning, and the Department \nof Communication, Aviation, and Meteorology\u2014to develop the NTP and TPPU and implement \nthe NTF, through coordination of a Transport Task Force that the Government will form. The \nTransport Task Force will serve as the project steering committee. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n23.  The TA cost is estimated at $825,000 equivalent; the foreign exchange component is \n$744,000 and the local currency component, $81,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $695,000 of \nthe foreign exchange costs and $5,000 of the local costs. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government  will finance $49,000 of the foreign \nexchange costs and $76,000 equivalent of the local currency costs through domestic resources. \nAppendix 2 gives cost estimates. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The Executing Agency (EA) for TA will be the Ministry of Infrastructure Development. \nThe Transport Task Force will oversee TA implementation under supervision of the permanent \nsecretary of the Department of National Reform and Planning, and comprising members at \npermanent  secretary  or  under  secretary  levels  from  relevant  ministries  and  private  sector \nrepresentatives. The under secretary of the Department of Infrastructure will be TA coordinator \nand TPPU, secretariat. \n ", "    5 \n25.  A total of 30 person-months of international consulting services are required in transport \nplanning, economics, and project management.  An additional 1 person-month of international \nconsulting will be required for an independent evaluation of the quality and completeness of the \ntraining program, and recommend adjustments to the work program and methods. Consulting \nservices will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nfollowing the quality- and cost-based selection procedures, using simplified technical proposals \nand other practices and procedures satisfactory to ADB. Appendix 3 gives terms of reference for \nconsultant services.   \n \n26.  The consulting firm will provide three specialists to provide most inputs: a transport \nplanner-economist  and  team  leader,  a  transport  specialist,  and  a  project  management \nspecialist. The firm will also arrange overseas on-the-job training and technical backup through \nassociation with a partner agency.  \n \n27.  An initial short visit by the consultants is envisioned to assess training and institutional \nneeds, agree on the NTP structure and content, gather data, and identify projects to use for \nhands-on procurement training and contract administration. Most consultant services will be \ndelivered within about a year (with timing and duration agreed upon with MID). Formal training \nwill be conducted in parallel with production of the substantive outputs. Short follow-up visits by \nthe consultants will be scheduled throughout the second year. \n \n28.  To enable benefits of the study to be realized, the Government will establish a TPPU \nwithin MID. At least two staff will be placed in the unit to work with, and be trained by, the \nconsultants. The project management unit of the Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project \nwill make three technical staff available for training in asset management. MID\u2019s marine and civil \naviation divisions will assign staff for these purposes. The Government will provide offices and \nlogistical support, including funds for immediate TPPU staff development plans for 2 years of TA \nimplementation and operational expenses. TA implementation will begin in January 2005, and \nend in December 2006. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure and Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

Objectives and Scope \n1.  The goal of consulting services is to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry \nof  Infrastructure  and  Development  (MID)  to  effectively  plan  and  manage  infrastructure \ndevelopment in Solomon Islands in a sustainable manner.
