INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  regional  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \ndevelopment of comprehensive regional disaster risk financing (DRF) solutions to assist the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) countries1 in reducing their physical and \nfinancial vulnerability to natural hazards. This will include the (i) preparation of disaster risk \nassessments based on state-of-the-art modeling methodologies for all CAREC countries to \nquantify the risk associated with the main natural hazards; (ii) evaluation of the protection gap2 \nand the capacity to quantify the economic benefit of disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures;3 and \n(iii) design of a sustainable regional disaster risk transfer pilot scheme to manage disaster risk for \nselected CAREC countries. The TA will also seek to raise awareness among government officials \nof all ministries and agencies to be involved, the local private sector, and the public about the \nvalue of DRF instruments, including insurance.  \n \n2.  The concept of developing a regional DRF mechanism was presented and discussed with \ngovernment officials from the 11 CAREC countries in a special session organized during the \nCAREC National Focal Points\u2019 Meeting on 9\u201310 October 2018 in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and \nprompted member countries\u2019 interest in driving the discussions forward.  \n \n3.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its operational priority 3\u2014tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability\u2014as \nwell as with the Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management 2014\u20132020,4 the \nStrategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration \n2019\u20132024,5 and the Financial Sector Operational Plan.6 It also supports the implementation of \nthe CAREC 2030 strategy, in which disaster risk management is included as an area of focus for \nforging regional cooperation going forward. It is also aligned with the priorities of the Sendai \nFramework  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  2015\u20132030,7 to  which  all  CAREC  countries  are \nsignatories.8 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Economic losses as a result of disasters have dramatically increased worldwide, for an \nestimated annual average of $186 billion since 2008. In 2017, the (re)insurance industry paid out \na record $144 billion to finance disaster losses. Even so, these insured losses represented only \nabout 45% of the total economic losses in 2017 ($345 billion). Asia accounts for nearly 40% of \nthe world\u2019s economic losses from disasters between 2008 and 2018. However, the protection gap \nin the region is even more significant\u2014only 12% of losses on average were insured since 2008.9 \nAsian governments have mostly financed the cost of recovery by reallocating budgets, raising \n \n1  Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC\u2014Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \nUzbekistan. \n2  The protection gap is the difference between total economic losses from disasters and insured losses.  \n3  For instance, building defenses, improved spatial planning, ecosystem-based approaches, early warning systems, \nand building regulations. \n4  ADB. 2014. Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020. Manila.  \n5  ADB. 2019. Operational Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration. Manila.  \n6  ADB. 2011. Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila. \n7  Adopted at the Third United Nations Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015 in Sendai, Japan. It established \nfour priorities for action: (i) understanding disaster risk, (ii) strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster \nrisk, (iii) investing in disaster reduction for resilience, and (iv) enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response.  \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 October 2019.  \n9  Munich Re NatCatService, https://natcatservice.munichre.com/ (last accessed on 1 November 2019).  \n ", "2 \nrevenues and taxes, issuing debt, or relying on donations from abroad, on an ex-post basis. This \napproach  results  in  governments  overexposing  their  fiscal  budget  and  is  not  sustainable, \nparticularly not in light of rising disaster risk and rising levels of post-disaster financing needs. A \nrisk-layering approach that identifies the most appropriate instrument for each layer of risk is key \nto  overcoming  liquidity  constraints  and  ensuring  timely  recovery  and  reconstruction  in  the \naftermath of a disaster.  \n \n5.  Countries in the CAREC region face similar challenges, as they are highly exposed and \nvulnerable to earthquakes and hydrometeorological disaster risk (e.g., flooding and droughts). \nMoreover, the frequency and intensity of hydrometeorological hazards is expected to increase \nunder the impacts of climate change. Since the turn of the 21st century, several disaster events \nhave occurred in CAREC countries, causing significant economic losses that often transcend \nnational borders and create substantial fiscal challenges for each country.10 Between 2008 and \n2018,  estimated  economic  losses  from  disasters  in  CAREC  countries  totaled  more  than \n$22 billion.11 The significant incidence and intensity of natural hazard events in the region, and \nissues surrounding poor construction practices and insufficiently risk-sensitive land-use planning \nare contributing to considerable economic damage in the region. \n \n6.  While recent national and regional initiatives are encouraging,12 CAREC countries have \nnot  yet  fully  developed  or  implemented  comprehensive  disaster  risk  management  (DRM) \nstrategies that efficiently tackle the protection gap. Limited availability of reliable data on hazards, \nexposure, and vulnerability, as well as weak analytics and modeling capacities in CAREC \ncountries make  it  very difficult to  understand and  comprehensively  manage  disaster  risks. \nHowever, the insurance industry has been using innovative technology to develop data, analytics, \nand modeling methods. Global open-source and open-access probabilistic risk models developed \nbetween academia and the private sector can provide cost-effective and solid high-level disaster \nrisk profiles. With the support of multilateral development banks, such models have been used to \ndetermine the appropriate level of risk reduction, risk retention, and risk transfer measures and to \nquantify their respective economic benefits through consistent and best practice standards. \n \n7.  While measures exist to adapt to an ever-changing environment, decision makers in the \nCAREC countries at all levels\u2014from multinational organizations, sovereign and subsovereign \nstates, to cities, companies, and down to local communities\u2014need hard facts to decide whether \nthe benefits of undertaking DRR measures will outweigh their costs. However, the capacity for \ngenerating this kind of information is low, and the integration of DRR measures into the overall \ndevelopment planning and budgeting processes is still inadequate. The legal and regulatory \n \n10 Economic losses from severe floods totaled more than $18 billion in Pakistan between 2010 and 2014; $204 million \nin Tajikistan in 2010; and $230 million in Kazakhstan in 2008, 2010, and 2011. The Pakistan earthquake in 2005 was \none of the most devastating events in the region\u2019s history. It caused more than 73,000 deaths and economic damages \nestimated at $5.2 billion. Neighboring countries such as Afghanistan, India, Tajikistan, and the PRC were also \naffected by the tremors. The Tbilisi earthquake in Georgia in 2002 also affected nearly 20,000 people and caused \neconomic losses of $350 million. Source: EM-DAT database, https://www.emdat.be/ (last accessed on 1 November \n2019). \n11  Munich Re NatCatService (footnote 9). Data not available for Turkmenistan. This figure does not include the PRC. \nEstimated economic losses in the PRC between 2008 and 2018 totaled $372 billion. Data on insured losses not \navailable for individual CAREC countries.  \n12  Initiatives in CAREC countries include (i) national disaster risk management projects by ADB in Pakistan (Grant \n0519, Grant 0639, Loan 3473, Loan 3474, and TA 9246); Tajikistan (Grant 0614); Kyrgyz Republic (TA 9726); and \nMongolia (proposed); (ii) the establishment of the Central Asia Centre for Emergency Situations and Disaster Risk \nReduction in 2016 in Almaty, Kazakhstan (funded by the European Union), and the meeting of heads of disaster \nmanagement authorities of Central Asian countries organized by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nin Almaty, Kazakhstan in April 2018; and (iii) DRR and climate change adaptation measures identified by all CAREC \ncountries, except the Kyrgyz Republic, in their nationally determined contributions to the 2015 Paris Agreement. \n ", "3 \nenvironment in CAREC countries needs to be strengthened to attract the required financing for \nDRR projects and promote private sector investments.  \n \n8.  In-depth disaster risk assessments that provide information on the expected levels of loss \nfor various types of hazards and intensities are key to designing DRF strategies that tap the full \nrange of available DRF instruments. These can include (i) risk reduction finance instruments,13 \n(ii) risk retention instruments,14 and (iii) risk transfer instruments.15 Development, access, and use \nof ex-ante DRF instruments for post-disaster response are still in their infancy in the CAREC \ncountries.  Public  contingent  finance  resources  allocated  for  ex-ante  DRF  are  limited.  The \ninsurance penetration ratio in CAREC countries, excluding the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nis very low at 0.6% on average in 2018.16 This is mostly because of the low understanding and \nawareness of the availability of such instruments, and of their benefit to enhance the financial \nmanagement of disaster risk. In addition, CAREC countries still need to strengthen the enabling \nlegal and regulatory environment to foster a sustainable insurance market that offers innovative \nand affordable risk transfer solutions.  \n \n9.  The global (re)insurance industry and the capital markets have developed numerous new \nsolutions  to  narrow  the  protection  gap  using  innovative  financing  instruments  and  new \ntechnologies to transfer risk both at sovereign and regional levels.17 A regional DRF facility \ncomplementing national DRM initiatives can provide additional value in various forms because it \n(i) allows for broader risk diversification across several countries with different risk profiles, \nleading to lower premiums and operational costs, and increasing affordability, especially for \ndisaster risk protection structures against low-frequency, high-severity events; (ii) creates a \nplatform for taking a coordinated approach to disaster risk analysis and improving risk information \nsharing,  since  disasters  often  know  no  boundaries;  and  (iii)  provides  an  opportunity  for \nparticipating countries to jointly access international reinsurance and capital market solutions that \nmight not be accessible or affordable for individual countries with small population sizes. A \nregional DRF mechanism is also a reliable tool to promote stability and solidarity among countries.  \n \n10.  The TA will build on past and ongoing DRM and DRF work conducted in CAREC countries, \nand the TA team will closely coordinate with other development partners that are implementing \nrelated projects in the region.18 Lessons from past initiatives include the need for (i) high-quality \ndata,  analytics,  and  modeling  for  a  comprehensive  risk-layered  DRF  approach;  (ii)  the \n \n13 Such as loans, microcredit, bonds, grants, subsidies and tax breaks, crediting, and impact bonds. \n14 Such as budget contingencies, reserve funds, lines of contingent credit, budget reallocations, government borrowing, \nand tax increases.  \n15 Such as insurance and its different forms\u2014e.g., mutual insurance, micro-insurance, agriculture insurances, risk \npools, and takaful insurance (Islamic insurance, i.e., a sharia-compliant alternative to conventional insurance). \n16  Insurance penetration is the ratio of insurance premium to gross domestic product. All CAREC countries, except for \nGeorgia and the PRC, have an insurance penetration ratio of less than 1%. In Georgia, that ratio was 1.2% in 2018, \nand in the PRC, it was 4.4%.

Data for 2017 \n(Kyrgyz Republic), 2014 (Turkmenistan), and 2010 (Tajikistan). \n17Examples in other  regions  include  the  Caribbean  Catastrophe  Risk  Insurance  Facility  (CCRIF),  the  Pacific \nCatastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), and the Pacific Alliance IBRD Cat Bond issuance. \n18 Given the limited financial resources available, the TA will build on disaster risk data collected and disaster risk \nassessments conducted under other ADB projects in CAREC countries. This includes: (i) national disaster risk \nmanagement projects in Pakistan (Grant 0519, Grant 0639, Loan 3473, Loan 3474, and TA 9246), Tajikistan (Grant \n0614), Kyrgyz Republic (TA 9726) and Mongolia (proposed); (ii) TA on Strengthening the Enabling Environment for \nDisaster Risk Financing (TA 9007); and (iii) TA on Developing the Insurance Sector for a Sustainable and Resilient \nSociety in Asia and the Pacific (proposed). It also includes initiatives from other development partners such as World \nBank projects in Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Kazakhstan; and an upcoming European Union-funded \nproject, Strengthening Financial Resilience and Accelerating Risk Reduction in Central Asia.  \n ", "4 \ncombination  of  cost-effective  DRR  measures  with  appropriate  DRF  instruments  for  the \nimplementation of sustainable DRM strategies; (iii) policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks that \nare  aligned  with  international  standards  to  enable  the  implementation  of  effective  DRF \ninstruments and (iv) capacity building of and coordination between various government authorities \nand agencies with clearly assigned ownership and roles. \n \n11.  The development and implementation of innovative DRF solutions that combine technical \nand financial resources from governments, the private (re)insurance industry, capital market \ninvestors, and development partners are growing in importance in developing countries. CAREC \ncountries may consider effective DRR measures, contingent financing instruments, and seek \ndisaster risk transfer mechanisms to the international private reinsurance and capital markets via \na regional sovereign disaster risk transfer facility, while time is needed to build sustainable local \ninsurance markets backed by international reinsurance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: macroeconomic resilience to disaster risks in \nthe CAREC region increased.19 The TA will have the following outcome: collaboration between \nCAREC countries in disaster risk financing, including insurance, increased.20 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Disaster risk assessments and modeling in CAREC countries produced. \nDisaster risk data, analytics, and modeling are key to quantifying risk, estimating potential \neconomic damages derived from natural hazards, and helping governments make informed DRM \ndecisions. The TA will support the development of high-level disaster risk profiles in all CAREC \ncountries for earthquakes and floods by using sophisticated multihazard catastrophe risk models \ndeveloped with the expertise gained by the insurance industry and academia.21 It will build on \nbest practices in risk modeling. Activities will include: (i) stochastic risk modeling producing \naggregated exceedance probability curves;22 (ii) high-level risk-layer modeling based on user-\nfriendly graphic interfaces and development of capability for conducting cost\u2013benefit analyses of \ndisaster risk reduction, retention, and transfer measures; and (iii) identification of risk exposure \nfor vulnerable populations, including women and other potentially marginalized groups, in part \nthrough consultation with citizens and civil society organizations. Baseline disaster risk in each \nCAREC country will be quantified taking into account expected economic growth and climate \nchange impacts, and the existing coping mechanisms will be reviewed to estimate the protection \ngap.  \n \n14.  Output  2:  Regional  disaster  risk  transfer  solution  designed.  Based  on  the \nassessments conducted under output 1, a subset of CAREC countries will be selected to design \na regional pilot disaster risk transfer mechanism,23 leveraging the international reinsurance and/or \n \n19 ADB. 2017. CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development. Manila. \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 For the PRC, only the two provinces that are part of the CAREC Program\u2014Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region\u2014will be included in the assessment.  \n22 The exceedance probability curve is an analytical tool used to describe the frequency\u2013severity distribution of disaster \nimpact. There is typically an inverse relationship between disaster severity and frequency of occurrence, i.e., the \nmore severe an event, the less frequently it is expected to occur. \n23 This TA will only cover the design of the pilot. The testing of such pilot will not be financed under this TA.  \n ", "5 \ncapital markets (e.g., via catastrophe bonds or \"cat bonds\"), and to assess its feasibility, building \non best practices and lessons from regional disaster risk pools developed in other parts of the \nworld (footnote 17). The countries will be selected according to the extent of the identified \nprotection gap, including gaps in the provision of protection for women and other vulnerable \ngroups, as well as the interest expressed by member countries to bridge the gap through a \ncollaborative approach. Based on the quantified disaster risk profiles and damage exceedance \ncurves, a layered approach will be suggested for selecting the most suitable DRF instruments \nand determining the optimized level of disaster risk retention versus disaster risk transfer.  \nDetailed operational and financial framework for the disaster risk transfer facility will be developed, \nincluding  the  definition  of  triggers,  premium,  and  coverage  per  country;  payout  process; \nadministrative, institutional, governance, and legal structures; and transaction documentation. It \nwill also analyze selected countries\u2019 existing DRF regulations, laws, and institutional structures, \nand determine the policy and regulatory reforms needed to implement a regional disaster risk \ntransfer scheme. Consultations with key public and private stakeholders will be conducted for this \npurpose at both national and regional levels, leveraging the CAREC platform to facilitate dialogue \nbetween countries and build consensus on the most effective and sustainable regional disaster \nrisk transfer solution in the CAREC region. \n \n15.  Output 3: Capacity for disaster risk financing, including insurance, enhanced. \nCapacity building and awareness raising activities at CAREC level will be conducted to sensitize \nkey public and private stakeholders24 about the benefits of DRR, risk retention, and risk transfer \nsolutions. This will help all CAREC countries to further develop their national DRM initiatives in a \ncomprehensive manner, and adopt a layered approach to DRF, combining national and regional \nsolutions. Regional and national workshops and knowledge-sharing events will be organized to \nimprove countries\u2019 understanding of disaster risk modeling and the comprehensive use of the \nwide range of DRF instruments. Best practices from other regions will be showcased. These \nworkshops will also help generate the necessary interest for and ownership of the implementation \nof a regional DRF facility in the CAREC region. The design and feasibility of disaster risk transfer \nsolutions, including the corresponding legal and regulatory requirements for implementing such \nsolutions, will be elaborated with selected CAREC countries.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which (i) $1,387,130 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6), (ii) $112,870 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TASF\u2013other sources, and (iii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund and administered by ADB.25 The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision  of  the  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  and  the  Finance  Sector  Group  of  the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department will jointly implement the TA.26 They \n \n24 This includes local insurance industry stakeholders and insurance supervisors, disaster risk management agencies, \nand all other government authorities and agencies that need to be involved in this process and dialogue.  \n25 Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg.  \n26 The TA is part of the portfolio of the Central and West Asia Department since it is being conceptualized and will be \nimplemented under the framework of the CAREC Program. Given this, its Regional Cooperation and Operations \nCoordination Division will assume the overall coordination of the TA, while the Finance Sector Group of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department will lead the technical side of it.  \n ", "6 \nwill select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize workshops and seminars; and monitor \nTA implementation in close coordination with the East Asia Department, resident missions, and \nother operations and knowledge departments. The TA will be implemented over 36 months \n(November 2019\u2013October 2022).
