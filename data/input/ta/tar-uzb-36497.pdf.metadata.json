The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  requested  assistance  for  developing  an  enabling \nenvironment to promote free and fair competition, increase efficiency and productivity, and \nprotect consumer interests. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Tashkent from 10 to 22 February \n2003  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost, \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements for the technical assistance (TA).1 The TA logical \nframework is given in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Competition Policy.  An effective competition policy promotes efficient allocation of \nresources and economic growth, includes an appropriate regulatory environment based on \ndetailed and clear legislation focusing on regulating anticompetitive behavior (all participants \nknow the \u201crules of the game\u201d and what they need to do to avoid breaching them), and promotes \ngood governance by diminishing the opportunities for rent seeking behavior and corruption. In \ntransition economies, competition policy is often associated with fair trade, resulting in a legal \nframework  designed  to  protect  small  competitors  rather  than  to  promote  efficiency. \nGovernments often question the value of competition, raising concerns that it will expose small \nlocal enterprises to extinction from large multinationals.  \n \n3.  There  is  a  limited  understanding  of  the  basic  concepts  of  competition  policy  in \nUzbekistan. In contrast to approaches adopted in more developed markets that focus on the \nregulation of anticompetitive behavior and in other transition economies, the current regulatory \nframework relies primarily on the imposition of price controls on enterprises based on the size of \ntheir  market  share  or  sector  engaged  in  (natural  monopolies).  Once  these  \u201cmonopoly \nenterprises\u201d are identified, they are placed in a Register of Monopoly Enterprises (the Register), \nand price controls are imposed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). As of 1 January 2003, 386 \nenterprises were categorized as monopolies, providing 247 types of products.2   \n \n4.  Natural monopolies are broadly defined to include any enterprise engaged in energy \n(including  transportation  thereof),  transport,  telecommunications,  and  water  and  water \ntreatment. The Government plans to restructure 23 large enterprises in many of these sectors \nunder its ongoing case-by-case privatization program.3 Major enterprises in the privatization list \ninclude  Uzbek  Telecom  (telecommunications),  Uzbekneftegaz  (oil  and  gas  sector),  and \nUzbekistan Temir Yullari (rail).  The absence of an effective competition policy and adequate \nregulatory  mechanisms  for  the  sectors  being  restructured  could  result  in  the  transfer  of \nmonopoly power from the public to the private sector or the maintenance of the status quo.  \n \n5.  The World Bank and the TACIS Technical Dissemination Project (TDP) provided TA to \nthe State Committee on Demonopolization and Competition Development (CDCD) in 2001/2002 \nfor developing proposals to amend the legislative framework to move toward more behavior-\nbased regulation4 and to incorporate European Union directives, respectively. Under the World \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 February 2003. \n2  Note the number of monopoly enterprises and monopoly products has declined significantly from 1999 (from 716 \nand 1,924, respectively). \n3  The case-by-case privatization program was announced in 1996. To date, none of these enterprises has been sold \nbased, in part, on the Government\u2019s high price expectations. \n4 International best practice standards for competition regulation do not regulate firms based on status or size but \nrather on behavior that imposes barriers to market entry (anticompetitive conduct). ", " 2 \n \n \nBank assistance program, practical guidelines for monitoring and prosecuting anticompetitive \nbehavior were also developed as an interim measure. Discussions with CDCD staff reflect the \nongoing need for capacity building at higher staff levels to understand these recommendations, \ndevelop ownership, and successfully pursue needed reforms with key decision makers.  \n \n6.  Company Ownership Structure and Its Implication for Competition. Although there \nare more than 4,700 joint stock companies (JSCs) in Uzbekistan, approximately 3,000 continue \nto be state owned or controlled. The remaining 1,700 are privately owned. The Government's \nownership interest is managed by the State Property Committee (GOS Kom Imushestvo) which \nappoints state trustees for JSCs in which it owns 25% or more of equity capital (932 JSCs) and \ntrustee managers for JSCs in which it owns less than 25% of equity capital (2,068 JSCs). State \ntrustees and trustee managers sit on the supervisory boards of JSCs and until recently, could \nveto  any  supervisory  board  decision.  Most  JSCs  belong  to  production  trade  associations \n(PTAs), former line ministries that are heavily involved in the business operations of their \nmembers, including resource quotas and price controls.       \n \n7.  On 24 January 2003, a presidential decree \u201cOn Measures for Fundamental Increase of \nPrivate Sector\u2019s Share and Importance in the Economy of Uzbekistan\u201d5 was issued to facilitate \nprivate sector development and promote a more competitive business environment. Among \nother  things,  this  decree  incorporated  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  recommendations, \nincluding removal of the preferential voting rights of state trustees and managers who are \nmembers of a JSC supervisory board and the right of PTAs to interfere in the operations of their \nmembers.6 CDCD will need to develop and implement a strategy to monitor PTA compliance \nwith this decree. \n \n8.  Legal and Regulatory Framework. International best practice standards promote the \nadoption of competition laws to prevent businesses from engaging in anticompetitive practices \nthat  increase  their  profitability  at  the  expense  of  consumers  and  efficient  operation  of  the \nmarket.  Sound  economic  analysis  is  incorporated  into  the  review  of  allegations  of \nanticompetitive behavior. As these jurisdictions deregulate monopoly positions, competition laws \nare complemented by sector-specific regulations.   \n \n9.  The  current  legal  and  regulatory  framework  in  Uzbekistan  ignores  case-by-case \neconomic analysis of monopolistic behavior and instead imposes price controls on firms based \nsolely on market share. Application of a market share standard in Uzbekistan is difficult because \nof current market distortions (subsidies, exclusion of state-controlled firms from regulation).  The \nlegal framework does not address issues relating to the unbundling of \u201cnatural monopolies\u201d that \nare currently being privatized. New regulations are needed to ensure that enterprises that have \nbeen unbundled have access to inputs and services that may only be available to incumbent \nfirms, many of which may continue to be state owned or controlled.  \n \n10.  A draft proposal to amend the Competition Law was recently prepared by CDCD to \naddress some of these issues. However, initial review of the legislation indicates that the focus \nof regulation may still be to regulate enterprises with a dominant market share (35%) that may \nbe  engaged  in  anticompetitive  behavior.  In  addition,  the  draft  continues  to  require  CDCD \napproval of acquisitions of 35% or more of an enterprise and mergers/business combinations, \n                                                 \n5  No. UP-3202. \n6  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Corporate Governance and Reform Program. \nManila. \n   ", "  3\nboth of which will impose constraints to enterprise restructuring. CDCD has not prepared any \nproposals to amend the Natural Monopoly Law.7  \n \n11.  Institutional  Framework  for  Competition  Policy  Implementation.  CDCD  was \nestablished as a department of MOF in 1992 and transformed into an \u201cindependent\u201d state \ncommittee in 2000. However, CDCD is not operationally independent. It is required to report to \nthe cabinet of ministers, members of which have vested interests in maintaining the status quo.  \n \n12.  As set forth in the Competition Law, although CDCD is responsible for demonopolization \nand competition development, its primary function has been to determine which enterprises are \nacting as monopolies for purposes of imposing price controls and sanctions.  CDCD is headed \nby a chairman appointed by the cabinet of ministers and approved by parliament. It has a core \ncentral staff of 50 persons and thus relies heavily on regional staff (342 staff at 14 regional \noffices) to help monitor JSCs for compliance with the current legal and regulatory framework, \nincluding detection of \u201cmonopolies\u201d and anticompetitive conduct.  \n \n13.  A majority of regional office staff resources are allocated to the maintenance of the \nregister system. Proposed amendments to the Competition Law, which incorporate behavior- \nbased factors into the determination of whether an enterprise is acting as a monopoly that \nshould be subject to price controls and evaluation of mergers, will require CDCD to transform \nfrom an analytical, research body to a regulatory body with an emphasis on investigation.  \nInvestigative standards to determine anticompetitive behavior involve complicated statistical \nanalyses, careful review and understanding of the details of business records of individual firms, \nsubjective judgments about basic issues such as product definition and substitution, proof of \nintent, etc.  Merger analysis is equally complex.  \n \n14.  Eighty five percent of CDCD staff, economists trained under the former Soviet system, \nhave limited understanding of and are incapable of analyzing market structure and performance. \nThe  World  Bank  has  provided  training  to  mid-level  staff  on  how  to  conduct  case-by-case \ninvestigations and analysis centering on firm behavior, promotion of competition, and analysis of \nan individual firm\u2019s economic power.8   \n \n15.  External controls on anticompetitive behavior are weak and based on poor corporate \ngovernance practices and lack of understanding of the role of competition in a market economy.  \nKey decision makers, including other government bodies and the judiciary, whose support is \nneeded to effectively transform CDCD\u2019s role, do not have a basic understanding of competition \nand related policies and economic impact.  \n \n16.  Operations and Strategy of ADB and Other Aid Sources. ADB is supporting the \nGovernment in the restructuring and liquidation of state-owned enterprises within the broader \nframework of reform of corporate governance and enterprise restructuring. ADB provided TA9 in \n2000 to, among other things, review the adequacy of the policy and institutional framework for \ncorporate  governance  and  facilitate  capacity  building  activities  to  promote  private  sector \n                                                 \n7  Note the imposition of price controls by MOF, including the methodologies used, is not the subject of the current \nTA.  \n8  Kelly, Gary M. 2002.

That TA was followed by another10 in December 2002 to strengthen corporate \ngovernance of the enterprise sector and facilitate restructuring and liquidation, and by a related \nTA11 to strengthen institutional capacity to support capital market development. The current TA \nwill  also  support  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  growth  by  developing  a  new \ninstitutional framework for promoting competition.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n17.  The  TA  will  help  promote  private  sector  growth  by  creating  a  better  enabling \nenvironment to promote development of a more competitive and healthy enterprise sector that \nbetter protects consumers.
