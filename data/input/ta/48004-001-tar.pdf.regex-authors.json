INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested support from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen elderly care services in Yichang, Hubei Province. \nA fact-finding mission took place in Yichang in February\u2013March 2014, and ADB reached an \nagreement with the Yichang Municipal Government (YMG) on the impact, outcome, outputs, \ncosts and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices for the technical assistance (TA). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The main demographic challenges facing the PRC in this century are the dramatic aging \nof its population and the scale of internal migration, which is largely driven by urbanization. The \nproportion of people above the age of 60 across the PRC is expected to grow from roughly 12% \nin 2010 to 34% by 2050.2 The PRC\u2019s population is aging rapidly at a time when the per capita \nincome remains modest; social security systems cover a broad portion of the population, but are \nstill  insufficient to  meet  the financial  needs  of  retired  senior  citizens,  as  illustrated  by  the \nYichang experience.3 The high cost of care for the elderly will require long-term care financial \ncoverage mechanisms to avoid major inequities in the way people experience their life as \nseniors. Furthermore, the current acute shortage of caregivers and nurses specialized in elderly \ncare, most of whom are women, is exacerbated by low compensation levels and working \nconditions that make these professions unattractive.4  \n \n3.  The PRC has been addressing the consequences of its aging population since the late \n1970s, with successive policies to finance old age care, stimulate private sector participation, \ndefine the responsibilities of families, and organize community-wide responses to support the \nelderly. The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2010\u20132015 further recognized these challenges. It \ncalled for establishing an old age care system (with targets for home-based care, community \ncare,  and  institutional  care) 5  expanding  grassroots  aging  associations;  encouraging \nvolunteerism among senior citizens; and improving health management services.  \n \n4.  The 2012 revision of the Elderly Law includes requirements for local governments to \ndevelop  community  services  for  senior  citizens.6 The recent  opinions  of the  State  Council \n(September 2013) to accelerate the development of the elderly care service industry recognizes \nthe  progress  made  and  the  significant  challenges  that  remain.7 The  challenges  include \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 May 2014.  \n2  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision. \nhttp://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/world-population-prospects-the-2010-revision.html   \n3  The average monthly pension for a former state employee is CNY2,300, for an employee of a firm CNY1,400, and \nfor rural citizens CNY60 (shared by the Bureau of Human Resources and Social Security of Yichang Municipality to \nthe project team during the fact-finding mission). \n4  By 2015, 15 million older people in the PRC will require daily care, while currently there are only 300,000 people \nemployed as caregivers, of whom 100,000 are qualified and trained (D. Peng. 2012. Training Challenges to Meet \nthe Need for Care Givers in China [ADB recognizes this member by the name the People's Republic of China]. \nPresentation at the Asia/Pacific Regional Conference on Ageing 2012: Rapid ageing:  a caring future. Myanmar. 8\u2013\n11 May). \n5  Current targets are 90% of elderly to age at home supported by home care services, 7% to receive community-\nbased services, and 3% institutional services. (National People's Congress. 2011. Twelfth Five-Year Plan for \nNational Economic and Social Development, 2011\u20132015. Beijing.) \n6  Law of the People's Republic of China on Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Elderly. \n7  State Council. 2013. Opinions on Promoting the Development of Senior Care Service Industry (Circular No. 35). \nBeijing. \n ", "2   \ninsufficient elderly care services and products, an underdeveloped market, and imbalanced \nregional rural\u2013urban development. The opinions of the State Council include a comprehensive \nlist  of  policy  directions;  set  development  goals;  describe  organization  and  management \narrangements; and assign responsibilities to combine public, private, and civil society efforts.  \n \n5.  In the PRC, children traditionally took primary responsibility for caring for their parents\u2019 \nmedical and nonmedical needs (e.g., daily activities and emotional and financial requirements). \nHowever, the ability of children to meet this traditional responsibility is increasingly challenged \nby several factors, including small family size (resulting in part from the one child policy), high \nlabor force mobility, the high labor participation rate of women, increasing financial burdens on \nthe families of children with the duty to care, and the eroding importance of filial piety. Support \nprovided by the government for the poor elderly includes (i) payment of social pensions for poor \nrural  and  urban  citizens;  (ii)  provision  of  residential  or  community-based  care services for \nselected elderly living on social assistance; and (iii) support to the most destitute, including \nchildless old people and elderly whose children also live in poverty. 8 \n \n6.  Currently, only childless elderly people living on social assistance such as the \u201cThree \nNos\u201d in the cities and \u201cFive Guarantees\u201d households in the countryside are provided residential \nor  community-based  care  services  by  the  government.9 Other  elderly  welfare  assistance \nrecipients are generally ineligible for care subsidies by the government. There is a need for the \ngovernment to expand subsidies for these elderly people, including to low-income households \nthat are slightly above the poverty threshold (the marginal poor).10  \n \n7.  Yichang  Municipality  submitted  a  project  proposal  to  ADB  through  the  Ministry  of \nFinance to provide TA to strengthen local policies and strategies, and to update its elderly \nservice facilities construction plan as a way for the municipality to address elderly care issues \nfor  the  urban  population.11 The municipality  previously  adopted  an  elderly  service facilities \nconstruction plan in urban areas of Yichang City in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan. Hubei Province has selected Yichang to become a model city for the provision of \nelderly care in the PRC. The TA findings will potentially be replicable in Hubei and nationally, \nand will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on planning elderly care services in the \nPRC.  \n \n                                                \n8  The latter benefits are delivered through two major means-tested social assistance schemes: (i) wubao (Five \nGuarantees Program), which subsidizes the rural elderly who lack family caregivers, working ability, and income; \nand (ii) dibao (minimum living standard guarantee scheme), which provides cash assistance for urban and rural \nhouseholds with per capita incomes less than the locally determined poverty threshold. While a social pension has \nbeen widely adopted across the country, its scope is limited. Government subsidies for senior citizens aged 80 and \nabove consist of monthly payments of CNY50\u2013CNY300 per person. \n9  \u201cThree Nos\u201d and \u201cFive Guarantees\u201d elderly households refer to elderly who have no family caregivers, working \nability, and income. \n10 Marginal poor households are usually defined as those with household incomes 150%\u2013170% higher than the local \ndibao threshold. \n11 In 2012, Yichang Municipality had a total population of over 4.00 million, and an urban population of 1.34 million; \nthere were 652,100 senior citizens over 60 years of age, representing about 16.06% of the overall population, and \nabove the national average of 13.70%. \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be a more inclusive and affordable elderly care system in \nYichang. The outcome will be a balanced elderly services strategic development plan (covering \ninfrastructure, community, and home-based care) for Yichang.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To prepare an elderly services strategic development plan for Yichang, the TA will (i) \nidentify national and international best practices on elderly care and analyze their applicability to \nYichang Municipality, (ii) provide capacity development support to key stakeholders in Yichang \nto increase their understanding of elderly needs assessment and services planning, and (iii) \nimplement  a  participatory  planning  process  to  develop  a  strategic  elderly  care  services \ndevelopment  plan  covering  institutional,  community,  and  home-based  services  (including \nopportunities to initiate public\u2013private partnerships).  \n \n10.  Key activities of the TA will be organized under four outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Study report on  the national and international experience on \nelderly care. The TA will review national and international literature on elderly \ncare and service planning, identify best practices, and prepare a study report. \nAnticipated topics of interest are the role of public, private, and nongovernment \norganizations;  a  review  of  the  legal  framework,  including  private  sector \nengagement;  cost  and  financing;  financial  capacity  of  central  and  local \ngovernments to provide elderly care services; incentive structures to promote \nprivate sector investment and management (both profit and nonprofit); special \nactions for vulnerable groups and women; and human resources development. A \nlimited number of field visits will be organized within  the PRC to learn from \nsuccessful experiences. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Capacity  development  on  elderly  care  services  planning.  A \ntraining needs assessment will constitute the basis for the preparation of training \nmaterials and delivery of training for concerned officials of YMG, the private \nsector,  and  civil  society  stakeholders.  Anticipated  training  topics  will  include \nelderly  needs  assessment,  services  planning  and  costing,  human  resources \ndevelopment, and quality monitoring. The TA will also organize an overseas \nstudy tour12 on elderly care systems planning, development, and monitoring for \nkey officials. \n(iii)  Output 3: Elderly service facilities construction plan of Yichang reviewed \nand a strategic elderly care services development plan prepared. The TA \nwill assess the elderly service facilities construction plan of Yichang. Primary \ndata will be collected through a survey (disaggregated by sex and other relevant \naspects) to better understand the care needs of the elderly, and the extent to \nwhich  these  are  currently  covered.  Participatory  reviews,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  and  planning  workshops  that  include  beneficiaries,  public  and \nprivate  sector  professionals,  and  decision  makers  will  help  develop  and \ndetermine the broad strategies, structure (including institutional arrangements), \nand timeline of a realistic strategic plan.  \n                                                \n12 The study tour will take place in Asia in at least two countries (e.g., Japan and the Republic of Korea) with a focus \non establishing public-private partnerships for nursing homes, community, and home-based care. \n ", "4   \n(iv)  Output 4: Dissemination of findings. Two workshops and a final conference \nwill be held to disseminate TA findings, with participation by local, provincial, \nnational, and international experts. A policy brief knowledge product on elderly \ncare system development for the PRC decision makers will be prepared. A final \nTA report will be submitted to YMG and ADB. \n \n11.  Potential risks are (i) inadequate or delayed provision of necessary data, (ii) delayed \nsubmission of required studies, (iii) inadequate performance of consultants, and (iv) inefficient \ndissemination of TA findings and outputs. To mitigate risks, the recruitment and performance of \nconsultants will be monitored closely. The government has agreed to provide all necessary data \nin  a  timely  manner  and  adequate  counterpart  support.  Close  coordination  among  the \nconsultants,  YMG,  and  ADB  will  further  mitigate  risks,  as  will  the  establishment  of  a \nmultisectoral steering committee. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of the provision of office accommodation and venues for \nselected meetings, counterpart staff (YMG staff) and allowances, miscellaneous administration \nexpenses,  local transportation for field  visits  within  Yichang  Municipality,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  YMG will be the executing agency for the TA. The Yichang Finance Bureau (YFB) will be \nthe implementing agency. YMG and YFB will each designate a senior staff member as TA focal \npoints. A project steering committee composed of concerned Yichang government bureaus and \nagencies, relevant educational institutions, private sector representatives, and representatives \nof beneficiaries will be established. YMG will chair the project steering committee and convene \nquarterly meetings. \n \n14.  The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's TA Disbursement \nHandbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  implementation,  ADB  may \nestablish an advance payment facility for YFB to support certain agreed cash expenditures\u2014 \nincluding workshop, survey, training and overseas study tour, and administrative costs\u2014with \ndetails of the proposed activities, including cost estimates, submitted through the executing \nagency to ADB for approval. ADB may also make certain direct payments (e.g., for workshop \nvenues). \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, tentatively from 18 July 2014 to 23 July \n2015. In dialogue with YMG and YFB, ADB will engage two national (12 person-months) and an \ninternational consultant (3 person-months), who will report to YFB and ADB, and as requested, \nto YMG. The TA will also recruit a national consultant (3 person-months) on a lump-sum basis \nto implement a survey on the needs of and services for elderly people. The consultants will be \nhired on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The two national consultants will include specialists with \nexpertise in (i) elderly care including social and community care approaches, health, training, \nand survey methodology; and (ii) elderly care and private sector development, including not-for-\nprofit approaches, finance, and planning. The senior international consultant will be an aging \nspecialist with multi-country expertise in elderly care services planning. Consultant reports will \n ", "  5 \nbe prepared in Chinese and English. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n16.  Regular meetings and seminars will be held involving concerned Yichang government \nbureaus and agencies, relevant educational institutions, and private sector representatives. TA \nachievements  will  be  disseminated  through  two  workshops  during  the  preparation  of  the \nYichang  elderly  care services  strategic  development  plan, the  preparation  of  a knowledge \nproduct on elderly care systems development in the PRC, and a final conference on TA findings \nwith local, provincial, national, and international experts.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for Strategic Elderly Care Services Development in Yichang, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nThe elderly care  Coverage rate of elderly over  Yichang municipal  Economic growth rate \nsystem is more  60 increases:   statistics  remains high in the PRC.  \ninclusive and  (i) for residential care from     \naffordable in Yichang.   1.4% in 2014 to 4% in 2030;  Risk \n(ii) for home care from 80% in  The current trend of \n2014 to 90% in 2030.   rising inequality in the \nFor community care, the  PRC continues and \nnumber of urban community  prevents the \ncenters increases from 33 in  implementation of sound \n2014 to 289 in 2030.  social policies to promote \n  inclusiveness and \nAverage cost of residential  affordability. \ncare to median net pension of \nelderly for former state \nemployees changes from 42% \nin 2014 to 49% in 2030, and \nfor company employees from \n70% in 2014 to 49% in 2030. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nA balanced elderly  An elderly services strategic  Official municipal  The Yichang Municipal \nservices strategic  development plan for Yichang,  government  Government maintains \ndevelopment plan  including institutional,  issuance  its commitment to \n(covering  community, and home-based    improving the elderly \ninfrastructure,  services is submitted to  care system and adopts \ncommunity, and  Yichang Municipal  the plan. \nhome-based care) for  Government authorities by   \nYichang  April 2016  Risk \n    Yichang municipal \nofficials prioritize the \nconstruction of elderly \nhomes (infrastructure) \nover more inclusive and \ncost-effective community \nand home-based \nsolutions.   \n \n Outputs       Assumption \n1.
