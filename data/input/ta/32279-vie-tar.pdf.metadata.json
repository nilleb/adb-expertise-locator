INTRODUCTION\n1. Following the inclusion in the 2000 country program of advisory technical assistance\n(TA) to assess the need for low-income housing and secondary towns urban development, the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Fact-finding Mission visited Viet Nam from 8-19 May 2000. The\nMission held discussions with officials from the Ministry of Construction (MOC); Ministry of\nPlanning and Investment; Ministry of Finance; State Bank of Viet Nam; and representatives of\nexternal assistance agencies, financial institutions, and developers dealing with the housing\nsector. The Mission visited several provincial towns in the Central Region of the country and\nheld meetings with the provincial people\u2019s committees, provincial departments in charge of\nurban development, and representatives of community groups. Based on the discussions with\nstakeholders, the Mission reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives,\nscope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of\nreference for consulting services under the TA.1 The TA framework is attached in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The population of Viet Nam is estimated at 76.3 million, according to the 1999 census.\nThe urban population accounts for around 23.5 percent of the total population in 1999 compared\nwith 19.4 percent in 1989. This represents an increase of 5.4 million people living in urban areas\nin the last 10 years, and currently estimated at 18 million. The Government estimates that the\nurban  population  will  grow  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  5  percent.  By  2010,  the  urban\npopulation will reach 27 million and it will increase to 45 million by 2020.\n3. The Government\u2019s main focus on the development of urban areas since the mid-1980s\nhas  quite  rightly  been  in  the  water  supply  sector,  which  is  fundamental  to  improving\nenvironmental  health  and  human  development  in  any  urban  community.  ADB  has  been\nassisting the Government in this respect, and so far has provided funding for three water supply\nprojects2 and is helping prepare a new project.3 Other aid agencies have also been active in the\nsubsector. As a result of such assistance, 59 cities and provincial towns in the 61 provinces of\nthe country have received external funding for water supply projects.\n4. However, following many years or rapid urbanization, the level of investment made for\nmaintenance, repairs, and new capital works over the past decade in other urban subsectors\ndoes not appear sufficient to provide the necessary urban infrastructure and ready access to\nlow-cost  housing.  This  situation  has  led  to  serious  deficiencies  in  the  availability  of\ninfrastructure, municipal services, and housing in urban areas. Although the Government and\nseveral funding agencies, including ADB, have made efforts in recent years to improve the\nsituation in the larger urban centers,4 secondary towns have received much less attention. It is\nestimated that 10-15 percent of the population of the secondary towns is poor. The lack of\nadequate infrastructure and services, and their inability to access existing infrastructure and\nservices, accentuates their poverty and impacts on the quality of their living environment.\n                                                          \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2000.\n2  Loan 1273-VIE(SF): Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project, for $65.0 million,\napproved on 29 November 1993; Loan 1361-VIE (SF): Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for\n$66.0 million, approved on 17 August 1995; and Loan 1514-VIE(SF): Second Provincial Towns Water Supply and\nSanitation Project, for $69.0 million, approved on 27 February 1997.\n3  TA  3323-VIE: Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for  $1.0  million,  approved  on\n14 December 1999.\n4  Loan 1702-VIE(SF): Ho Chi Minh City Environmental Improvement Project, for $70 million, approved on 7 October,\n1999.", "2\n5. Infrastructure and services in urban centers throughout Viet Nam, and particularly in its\nsecondary towns, is inadequate. Existing facilities are also in poor repair. In urban areas the\nnumber of households with toilet facilities connected to sewers and drains is estimated to be\nless than 45 percent. Drainage systems for stormwater disposal cover less than 50 percent of\nthe urban population. There is almost no treatment of wastewater outside the two major cities of\nHanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Solid waste collection coverage is estimated to be around 40\npercent  of  all  urban  households.  Appropriate  infrastructure  to  support  the  collection  and\ncontrolled disposal of industrial wastes and hospital wastes is yet to be constructed in all urban\nareas. Road deterioration, poor public transit systems, and a substantial increase of the number\nof motorcycles have increased atmospheric pollution and congested traffic arteries.\n6. Paradoxically, although Viet Nam\u2019s secondary towns are deficient in terms of urban\ninfrastructure and services, they play a key role in the development of the rural economies that\nsurround them. They serve as high-income markets and distribution centers for agricultural\nproducts. They also facilitate the development of off-farm activities such as retail and wholesale\ntrade, transport, food processing, finance and credit, and the diversification of production toward\ngoods with higher value added such as dairy products, fresh vegetables and fruits, flowers, and\nhorticulture for the more sophisticated urban consumers. Further, secondary towns serve as\ntraining  grounds  for  temporary  migrants  from  rural  areas  in  skill  areas  such  as  building\nconstruction, restaurants, and dressmaking; these skills are quickly transferred to the rural\neconomies. The scope of these towns playing an important role in reducing both urban and rural\npoverty is considerable.\n7. Viet Nam\u2019s Central Region includes many secondary towns, both at the provincial and\ndistrict levels. Addressing their immediate infrastructure and service needs is a matter of priority\nbecause of the relatively high incidence of poverty in the region. Also, improved urban centers in\nthe Central Region will tend to deconcentrate populations in the country\u2019s larger urban centers,\nincluding  the  growth  poles  of  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  The  positive  effect  of  the\ndevelopment of towns on the surrounding rural areas has a precedent in the region of the Red\nRiver Delta. The rapid economic growth of urban areas in that region, with an increase of 47.2\npercent in real per capita expenditures between 1993 and 1998, has been surpassed by an\neven higher increase of 51.4 percent in the rural areas. The development of district towns as\nlocations  of  new  and  consolidating  agro-industries  and  for  providing  accessible  off-farm\nemployment will be essential to raise rural household incomes. This is a key element of the\ndevelopment strategy for the Central Region, which ADB will support.\n8. For the housing sector, MOC\u2019s development strategies indicate that the 1996 area of\nhousing in urban centers reached 80 million square meters (m2), an average area of 5.8 m2 per\nperson and that the development target should be 10 m2 per person in 2010. With the expected\nrapid growth of population and increased urbanization, the imbalance in demand and supply of\nthe  housing  stock  in  urban  areas  will  become  more  serious.  A  principal  constraint  to  the\nproduction  of  housing  is  the  availability  of  affordable  financing,  particularly  for  low-income\nhouseholds. Formal or regulated sources of finance through private housing finance institutions,\nsuch as the housing funds established in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, state-owned commercial\nbanks, and a few private joint-stock banks and insurance companies, are available, but do not\ncater  to  low-income  households.  Mortgage  loans  for  individuals  are  uncommon.  Because\nViet Nam  has  neither  a  refinancing  institution  nor  a  secondary  mortgage  market,  banks\nproviding mortgage loans are accumulating excessive liquidity risks. The majority of the poor,\nlow-income,  and  middle-income  households  meet  financing  needs  with  their  own  savings,\ncommunity-based contributions, and borrowings from friends and relatives. Alternatively, they\nborrow from moneylenders at very high interest rates. However, the availability of funding", "3\nthrough informal channels is likely to be limited to present levels. Another key constraint to the\nproduction and availability of housing in Viet Nam is related to the availability of land, and\nassociated legal and administrative issues such as land ownership, land-use rights, land-use\ncertificates, house registration, and transfer of property. In Viet Nam, private ownership of land\nis not allowed; however, Vietnamese are entitled to acquire land-use rights. The 1998 Land Law\nassures five rights for land users to exchange, transfer, lease, bequeath, and mortgage their\nland-use rights. A variety of land certificates were validated; however, little progress has been\nmade in primary registration in urban areas due to the long and complicated procedures. Land\nand real estate registration represents an obstacle for the expansion of formal mortgage loans.\n9. Making  land  and  finance  for  housing  available  to  the  increasing  urban  population,\nespecially the poor, at affordable costs will be a challenge for the Government. Assistance to\nmeet demands for housing, especially through the development of an affordable, market-based\nhousing finance system, and the exploration of innovative mechanisms to provide low-cost\nhousing  for  the  poorer  households  through  national  and  provincial  funds,  will  be  crucial.\nEqually, increasing cooperation between private and public stakeholders, and the formal and\ninformal  sectors,  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  quality  of  life  and  productivity  of  the\nbeneficiaries, and will reduce insecurity and vulnerability especially for the poor.\n10. In  1998,  the  Government  approved  a  master  plan  to  guide  urban  development  in\nViet Nam until 2020. The plan establishes the objectives and policies for sustainable urban\ndevelopment in Viet Nam that will create an effective economic and physical infrastructure and a\nhealthy  environment.  The  objective  of  the  plan  is  \u201cto  build  an  urban  system  with  modern\nsocioeconomic structure and techniques, and a clean urban environment to ensure stability,\nbalance, and sustainable development for each urban area and to contribute to the strategic\nduties of the state and push industrialization and modernization of the whole country.\u201d Based on\nthis objective, the Government\u2019s strategy is to implement the plan based on population growth\nand urbanization, land-use demand, and technoeconomic considerations. Ten economic growth\nregions  have  been  identified  for  the  country,  and  urban  infrastructure  targets  have  been\nspecified. In the housing sector, MOC has prepared a national housing strategy; it is awaiting\nthe Government\u2019s approval. Among other measures, the strategy proposes the creation of a\nnational housing fund to attract additional financing for the development of the sector.\n11. To support the objectives and policies of the Government in reducing poverty in the\nCentral Region, TA is required to assess the urban infrastructure and service needs of the\nsecondary  towns,  especially  in  terms  of  providing  the  poor  with  equitable  access  to  such\ninfrastructure  and  services.  These  needs,  together  with  an  assessment  of  the  technical,\nfinancial,  and  managerial  capacities  of  the  local  governments,  will  serve  as  the  basis  for\nplanning urban sector investments in the region both by the Government and ADB. Equally, TA\nis required to analyze the constraints and possibilities for financing and developing low-income\nhousing in the country.\n12. The  focus  on  the  Central  Region,  which  includes  three  subregions,  the  Central\nHighlands,  the  North-Central  Coast,  and  the  Central  Coast,  will  ensure  that  efforts  are\nconcentrated in areas with high incidence of poverty of 52, 48, and 35 percent respectively.\nAlthough the proportion of population living in urban areas in these three subregions is lower\nthan the national average, the number of people living in towns is projected to double during\n2000-2010. Hence, this geographic focus will contribute to achieving the objectives of ADB\u2019s\nemerging country operational strategy, which proposes to concentrate a significant share of\ndevelopment efforts in these subregions.", "4\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n13. The TA will support the objectives and policies of the Government in the urban sector by:\n(i)  designing  a  sustainable,  long-term  ADB  assistance  strategy  for  the  development  of\nsecondary  towns  in  the  Central  Region  of  Viet  Nam,  and  (ii)  assessing  the  situation  and\npotential for ADB support to the low-income housing subsector in the country, particularly\nhousing finance.  The strategy will evaluate institutional aspects, the impact on the poor, the\npotential for private sector participation, and sustainability. The study will serve as a basis for\nfuture ADB interventions in the different subsectors and prioritized towns.\nB. Scope\n14. The TA will have two parts.  Part A, the urban development component, will assess (i)\nurban infrastructure needs of provincial and district towns in categories II, III, IV, and V in the\nCentral  Region,  including  the  growth  potential  of  selected  towns  in  the  context  of  likely\ninfrastructure  bottlenecks  and  constraints;  (ii)  urban  services  requirements  of  the  selected\ntowns,  including  services  such  as  stormwater  drainage,  sanitation  facilities,  solid  waste\ncollection and disposal, roads and bridges, air pollution control, markets, bus terminals, street\nlighting, crematoria, and recreation facilities; (iii) institutional setup of the urban sector, including\nthe  analysis  of  legal,  administrative,  and  budgetary  systems;  agencies  involved;  and\nmanagement practices and policies, both at the central and decentralized levels of government;\nand (iv) Government and international assistance interventions. It will make recommendations\nfor ADB interventions in the urban sector of the Central Region.\n15. Part B, the low-income housing component, will assess (i) housing needs in Viet Nam,\nparticularly  low-income  housing  by  collecting  national  and  provincial  statistics  and  sample\nsurveys; (ii) housing finance demand and supply, including the analysis of the different financial\nmarkets (formal and informal), prices, interest rates, and institutions involved in the markets\nsuch  as  households,  companies,  housing  finance  institutions,  and  commercial  banks;\n(iii) institutional, legal, and policy arrangements; constraints; and opportunities for the provision\nof housing finance, especially low-cost housing for low-income groups; and (iv) Government and\ninternational assistance interventions. It will make recommendations for ADB interventions in\nthe low-income housing subsector, and particularly housing finance  in Viet Nam.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising $327,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and  $298,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance\n$500,000 equivalent, comprising $327,000 of foreign exchange costs and $173,000 equivalent\nof the local currency costs. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan\nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government contribution of $125,000\nequivalent will cover the remuneration of counterpart staff, including per diems; provision of\noffice accommodation and utilities; workshop facilities; and local travel. The details of the cost\nestimates and financing arrangements are in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n17. MOC will be the overall Executing Agency for the TA.  MOC will be responsible for TA\nimplementation  and  coordination  with  other  central  and  provincial  government  agencies", "5\nconcerned. MOC will appoint two TA coordinators, one for each part. The coordinators will be\nsupported by professional counterpart and support staff; MOC will provide adequate office\nspace and facilities to the consultants. To ensure full participation of the provincial governments\nand  coordinate  policy  inputs  from  the  government  agencies  concerned,  the  appointed  TA\ncoordinators in MOC, will be responsible for keeping senior staff of the provincial people\u2019s\ncommittees involved in the TA. Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Finance, Office\nof the Government, Ministry of Science Technology and Environment, and State Bank of Viet\nNam will be kept fully informed of the progress and results of the study.\n18. The TA will be undertaken by a consulting firm selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the use of\ndomestic  consultants.  The  simplified  technical  proposal  procedure  will  be  applied  to  the\nselection of a consulting firm. The TA will require 40 person-months of consulting services,\nincluding  10  person-months  of  international  expertise  and  30  person-months  of  domestic\nexpertise. Part A of the TA will require one international expert, an urban development specialist\nand four domestic consultants, including an urban governance and management specialist, an\nurban finance specialist, an urban engineer, and an urban social specialist. Part B will require\none international expert, a housing finance and policy specialist, and two domestic consultants,\na housing economist and a social and poverty specialist. The two parts of the TA will be\nindependent of each other. The international experts will be the team leaders of each of the two\nparts. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 3.\n19. Under Part A, relevant sector data will be collected for all provincial towns in the Central\nRegion. Six provincial towns and two district towns in the Central Region will be selected as\nexamples for a more detailed study at the local level. Participatory workshops in each selected\ntown will be convened to engage representatives of the government agencies concerned at\ncentral, provincial, and local levels along with public, nongovernment, and community groups,\nand private sector organizations. Two workshops, one on urban development in the Central\nRegion and another one on housing finance will be conducted during the latter part of the study\nto share and reassess the conclusions of the study with the stakeholders. In addition, poverty\nprofiles  will  be  prepared  for  each  of  the  selected  towns  in  part  A  and  participatory\nsocioeconomic surveys will be conducted.\n20. The TA will be implemented over five months from December 2000 to May 2001. For\neach of the two parts the consultants will submit an inception report, including a description of\nthe scope, approach, and detailed work program by the end of the third week, and a draft final\nreport within four months of the commencement of the study.  Tripartite meetings will be held\nwith the Government, ADB, and the consultants to discuss the TA reports. A final report will be\nsubmitted one month after the Government and ADB have provided comments on the draft final\nreport.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Socialist Republic\nof Viet Nam in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 for the purpose of the Low-\nIncome Housing and Secondary Towns Urban Development Needs Assessment Study, and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Project Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions/ Risks\nGoals\nTo improve the urban Wider coverage and Central and local Continued commitment of\nenvironment and quality of efficiency of urban services governments statistics and the central and local\nlife of Viet Nam's urban contribute to better health, reports; studies or reports governments with the\nresidents increased productive time, of bilateral/multilateral strategy agreed to, and\nhigher income, and agencies and timely implementation of\nreduced poverty. nongovernment the institutional, legal, and\norganizations economic reforms agreed\nto.\nContinued overall economic\ngrowth\nTo increase the availability Sustainable lending Demand for sustainable\nand affordability of housing institutions provide housing finance is not\nloans to low-income affordable housing loans to distorted by other\nhouseholds low-income households interventions in the financial\nmarkets\nPurpose\nTo prepare an Asian A strategy for future ADB Technical assistance (TA) The Government will\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) interventions in the urban consultants report, cooperate and provide\nstrategy to support the sector in the Central Region feedback from  the prompt support and data to\nGovernment\u2019s objectives in is prepared, and agreed to workshops, and tripartite the consultants.\nthe urban sector, by the Government. review meetings\nparticularly in the Central\nRegion of Viet Nam\nA strategy for potential\nTo prepare an ADB future interventions in the A consultative and\nstrategy to support the low- housing sector for low- participatory approach will\nincome housing sector, income groups is prepared, be followed.\nparticularly housing finance and agreed to by the\nGovernment.\nOutputs\nA.

Urban Sector Development Needs Assessment\n1.    The consulting firm will undertake the following activities:\n(i)  Hold a wide range of consultations with the government agencies concerned to\ndevelop a good understanding of the Government\u2019s vision, strategic objectives,\nand priorities for the urban sector in Viet Nam, especially in the Central Region.\nReview the officially stated policies, development plans, and programs of the\nGovernment directly related to the urban sector and the policies that indirectly\nimpact  on  urban  development.  Particularly  review  the Orientation for Urban\nDevelopment Master Plan for the year 2020,  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of\nConstruction (MOC).\n(ii)  Assess the role of the urban sector in the economy, its relationships with the rural\nsector, its sectoral composition, and trends in gross domestic product on a sector\nbasis,  as  well  as  present  and  projected  growth  rates.  Review  the  spatial\ndistribution of urban population and economic activities in the Central Region of\nViet Nam and the role, characteristics, and importance of migration from rural to\nurban areas. Analyze the factors affecting the distribution and movements of\npopulation  and  economic  activity,  including  (a)  environmental  resources  and\nconstraints, (b) comparative advantages of the particular locations of the national\nurban system, (c) macroeconomic and sector policies, (d) geographic pattern of\npublic and private sector expenditure, (e) existing and planned strategic national\ninfrastructure, and (f) international trade. Assess future trends of urbanization\nand the distribution of urban population and economic activities in the Central\nRegion.\n(iii)  Make an up-to-date assessment of the urban physical environment in the Central\nRegion of Viet Nam and the present status of infrastructure and current practices\non services, including, sanitation, wastewater treatment, drainage, solid waste\nmanagement, urban transport, and other municipal facilities.

Summarize information on types of houses and\napartment blocks, materials and quality of construction, prices of the houses,\nlevels of occupation, status of the occupants (owner, renter, etc.), the use of\nhousing stock for residential or commercial purposes, and regulation on housing\nrent and protection of rental rights. Assess the present and future supply of and\ndemand for land and housing, as well as the basic needs of the poor.\n(iii)  Analyze the domestic financial resources mobilization situation, from both the\nformal and the informal sector, and suggest measures to increase the flow of\ndomestic financial resources into the housing sector. Assess and recommend\nmeans by which both housing upgrading and new projects might be financed\nusing loans from private and public banks, nonbank financial institutions, savings\nand credit cooperatives, and/or through the relevant city budget. Define collateral\nrequirements  and  potential  onlending  terms  that  will  ensure  affordability  and\nincentives  to  borrow  at  each  stage  of  the  lending  process.  Analyze  various\nmeasures to reduce interest rate risks caused by maturity gaps between long-\nterm house lending and short- and medium-term borrowing.\n(iv)  Prepare  financial  and  operational  qualification  criteria  for  the  participation  of\npublic or private financial intermediaries in the housing sector based on prudent\nfinancial  management  standards.

Recommend a practically oriented mechanism to effectively ensure that\nmost of the funds go to the low-income households in the poor areas. Determine\nthe most effective roles, responsibilities, and institutional arrangements for the\nflow of funds from one or more sources, including Government counterpart funds,\nto several categories of beneficiaries. Particular attention will be given to the\nassessment  of  the  Housing  Development  Fund  (HDF),  the  institutional  and\noperational  arrangements  of  the  HDF,  and  management  of  the  HDF  at  the\nprovincial  level.  Determine  the  feasibility  of  alternative  financing  channels\nthrough provincial housing funds, state-owned banks, private joint-stock banks,\nand  cooperative  or  public  companies.  Evaluate  the  need  and  appropriate\nmechanisms for preparing a training and institutional strengthening program in\nhousing  finance  for  participating  commercial  banks,  government  institutions,\nsmall-scale contractors, and informal groups.\n(viii)  Develop a housing finance sector development program including ADB financing\nof housing loans to low-income group households, and policy reform program to\nmake housing mortgages a more attractive investment instrument. The strategy\nwill address the key issues in land, and housing finance, including (i) the priority\nsubsectors, type and size of cooperation, and appropriate delivery mechanisms;\n(b) measures for sustainability; and (iii) measures for increased access to land,\nand housing finance by the majority, especially the poor.
