The capability to innovate is increasingly  important in a globalized, industrialized, and \nknowledge-based economy. Innovation is a key driver of growth, as newly industrialized and \nemerging economies mostly from the Asia and Pacific have proved. The experience of these \neconomies shows that poor countries must build national capability for technological development \nand innovation to become richer and to sustain growth. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nassisted  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  building  capability  for  technological \ndevelopment and innovation 1 and has started rethinking ADB\u2019s role while reviewing its Long-Term \nStrategic Framework.2 Along with this effort, ADB has developed a regional technical assistance \n(RETA) to help DMC governments become better able to make public policies that will create an \nenabling environment for technological development and innovation by collecting and sharing good \nAsian practices.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Global economic activities become interdependent, competitive, and knowledge-intensive. \nAn abundant supply of low-wage unskilled labor and natural resources alone cannot provide \ncompetitive advantage. Throughout development history, technological progress\u2014 interwoven with \nits application in production, institutional adjustment, and socioeconomic change\u2014has driven the \nincrease of national wealth, productivity, and competitiveness. In view of this, the right policy \nchanges in accordance with technological developments and in support of innovation are essential. \nIn addition, advances in information and communication technology (ICT) are reshaping the way \neconomic agents interact and exchange ideas, and thereby remaking the dynamics of innovation \nand accelerating its pace. Developing countries are therefore keen to understand better (i) how \nnew technologies are created, adapted, applied, and harnessed; (ii) how innovations emerge and \ndiffuse; (iii) how technologies foster production and businesses; and (iv) how the countries can \neffectively use ICT to innovate. The search is on for strong evidence of the social and economic \nconsequences of innovation and its integral role in economic development. \n3.  The newly industrialized and emerging economies of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nIndia,  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,  Taipei,China,  and  Thailand  have  achieved  remarkable \neconomic  success  through  technological  development  and  innovation,  while  following  diverse \ndevelopment paths. The Republic of Korea, for one, has been dramatically transformed from one \nof the poorest countries to a vibrant and productive economy, with gross domestic product (GDP) \nper capita undergoing a 64-fold increase in 1970\u20132005, from $254 to $16,291. Among the crucial \nfactors in this success are good public policies\u2014manifest in the export-led industrialization strategy, \n                                                 \n1  ADB (i) facilitates and mediates the flow of the latest technologies from around the world in areas like clean and \nefficient energy; (ii) assists in the training and development of human resources in science and technology for careers \nin research and development (R&D) or other technical fields; and (iii) helps strengthen the capacity of DMCs to  \nacquire and use modern technology through secondary and higher education as well as through technical and \nvocational education. For more details, see the ADB discussion paper on Knowledge and the Long-Term Strategic \nFramework for ADB (2007). \n2  ADB. 2007. Toward A New Asian Development Bank in a New Asia. Report of the Eminent Persons Group to the \nPresident  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  Manila.  This  report  highlighted  the  importance  of  technological \ndevelopment and innovation and recommended that it be made one of ADB\u2019s five new operational priorities. It \nmentioned that ADB should promote collaboration between universities and technical institutions in the region; pay \ngreater attention to higher education, especially in the pure sciences; facilitate the provisioning of risk capital to new \nfirms; advocate innovation; and serve as a region-wide platform for periodic stocktaking. \n3  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 October 2007. \n ", "2   \nresearch and development (R&D) programs led by government research institutes in partnership \nwith private sector organizations, and industrial parks\u2014which enabled the country to build and use \nnational technological and innovation capabilities for development. Other well-known examples are \n(i) India\u2019s innovation policy and legislation, business process outsourcing, information technology \nparks,  and  rural  ICT  and  local  innovation  initiatives;  (ii)  Malaysia\u2019s  multimedia  super-corridor \ninitiative to attract foreign direct investments; (iii) the PRC\u2019s foreign investment and technology \ntransfer  strategy;  (iv)  Thailand\u2019s  university-industry  linkage  and  cluster  development;  and \n(v) Taipei,China\u2019s technology and industrial upgrading, led by small- and medium-sized enterprises. \n4.  The  development,  spread,  and  use  of  technology  and  innovation  generate  positive \nexternalities, and thus having the right public policy in place helps a country attain the socially \noptimum level of technology and innovation. Compared with other traditional areas of public policy, \ntechnology and innovation policy is relatively new: the theoretical framework is yet to be firmly \nestablished and the related government policy-making capacity tends to be weak, particularly in \ndeveloping countries. Therefore, good practices from successful economies can be a useful guide. \nHowever, these are generally scattered and couched in the rather academic language of case \nstudies,  research  papers,  presentations,  and  conference  reports\u2014too  obscure  for  DMC \ngovernment officials to absorb and use in developing their own policies.  \n5.  Several leading research institutes and universities in the region provide training programs \nin development studies and public policy for government officials from developing countries. But \ntheir curricula and courses generally lack systematic packaging of good cases particularly from \nnewly industrialized and emerging economies or do not give enough attention to public policy on \ntechnology and innovation. Specialized programs in science, technology, and innovation policy \nexist, but these are mostly in Europe or the United States, beyond the reach of most government \nofficials  from  Asian  developing  countries.  Since  January  2006,  the  United  Nations  University \n(UNU)\u2013Maastricht  Economic  and  social  Research  and  training  centre  on  Innovation  and \nTechnology (MERIT)4 in the Netherlands has been exploring a broad range of policy questions \nrelating  to  the  national  and  international  governance  of  science,  technology,  and  innovation, \nparticularly the creation, diffusion, and use of knowledge. The Science and Technology Policy \nResearch unit of the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom, founded in 1966, has been \nproviding research, consulting services, and teaching in science, technology, and innovation policy \nand management. The John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University has been \nproviding a 1-week executive training program in science, technology, and innovation policy for \nhigh-level decision makers in developing-country governments since 2002.  \n6.  The international development community, recognizing the importance of technology and \ninnovation in reducing poverty and sustaining growth, takes the subject into serious consideration \nas well. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which \nhas traditionally promoted science and technology for sustainable development through policy \nguidance and capacity building, is now stepping up its support for innovation capability building. At \nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development organized by UNESCO in 2002, the importance of \nscience and technology for sustainable development was reaffirmed by the participating heads of \nstate.5 More  than  300  policy  makers  and  cabinet  members  attended  the  latest  global  forum \nBuilding  Science,  Technology,  and  Innovation  Capacity  for  Sustainable  Growth  and  Poverty \nReduction, organized in February 2007 by the World Bank in cooperation with other regional \ndevelopment banks and bilateral donor agencies from the United Kingdom and Canada and with \n                                                 \n4  Available: http://www.merit.unu.edu/ \n5  Available: http://www.un.org/events/wssd \n ", "      3\nagencies of the United Nations (UN).6 The forum recommended that, given their limited base of \ntechnical and financial resources, developing countries should focus more on the use and diffusion \nof existing technologies to producers and end users by enhancing innovation capabilities, than on \ndirect formal investment in R&D.7 The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \n(UNCTAD) has recommended, in its paper on the least-developed countries,8 that developing \nproductive capacity9 is the key to sustained economic growth through the three closely interrelated \nprocesses of capital accumulation, technological progress, and structural change. The International \nDevelopment Research Centre (IDRC) created the Innovation, Policy and Science program in \n2006 to support the development of science, technology, and innovation policies and reduce \npoverty in developing countries. A recent UN paper on innovation stressed the significant role of \nscience, technology, and innovation in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \nurged  policy  makers  to  learn  continuously  from  the  global  pool  of  lessons  and  international \npartnerships that allow mutual learning. \n7.  The  need  for  region-based  knowledge-sharing  and  capacity-building  programs  in \ntechnological development and innovation is urgent. Regional research institutes and universities, \nwhile  generally  equipped  with  adequate  technical  research  and  teaching  capacity,  lack  the \ninternational partnership and knowledge-sharing platform for periodic stocktaking in technological \ndevelopment and innovation. The current capacity-building and training programs in Asia are not \nsufficient to transfer Asian good practices from successful economies to other developing countries, \nfine-tuned  to  match  their  problems,  conditions,  and  needs.  ADB,  in  partnership  with  regional \nresearch institutes and universities, is best positioned to meet the need. However, caution is \nrequired  as  good  institutions,  policies,  and  strategies  are  necessary  but  not  sufficient  for \ndevelopment.  Although  the  settings  may  be  similar  across  countries,  the  impact  will  vary \ndepending on the specific context of the countries concerned. Good practices, rather than being \ntransferred  wholesale,  should  merely  serve  as  a  tool,  or  at  least  a  guide,  in  designing  and \nimplementing homegrown institutions, policies, and strategies. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The RETA will contribute to improving the DMCs\u2019 capacity to build and use technology and \ninnovation for sustainable development. The envisaged outcome is the strengthened capacity of \nDMC policy makers, primarily government officials responsible for economic planning and policy \nmaking or specialized technology and innovation policy, to design and implement homegrown \npublic policies on technology and innovation.  \n                                                 \n6  The African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment (UNCTAD), and UNESCO were involved. For details go to http://www.worldbank.org/stiglobalforum. \n7  According to the International Council for Science, developing countries lack an infrastructure base for exploiting \ntechnology and innovation. Low-income countries are poor in terms of the various indicators for level of technology. \nThey spend a small proportion of GDP on R&D, usually less than 1%, compared with around 2.5% for high-income \ncountries. Low-income countries have fewer than 50 scientists per 100,000 people, compared with more than 3,000 \nThpee rv 1ie0w0,s0 0e0x ipnr ehisgshe-idn choemree inco aurnetr itehso. se of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n8m  eUmNCbeTrAsD, .B 2o0a0r6d.  oTf hDei rLeecatostr sD, eMvealnoapgede mCeonutn,t roier ss tRaeffp, oarnt d2 0m0a6:y  Dbeev perloepliimngin Parroyd iunc ntivaetu Crea.p  acities.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The RETA will select the partner training institute(s) through competitive bidding among \nuniversities, research institutes, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and private institutes in the \nregion that currently provide capacity-building and training programs for DMC government officials \nin public policy, economic planning and management, development economics and studies, and \ninternational economics, and that intend to develop or enhance their curricula or training courses in \ntechnology and innovation policy using good Asian practices.  \n10.  Twenty government officials (8 junior-level and 12 senior-level) from four pilot DMCs each \nfrom the countries covered by the East Asia Department (EARD), the Central and West Asia \nDepartment (CWRD), the South Asia Department (SARD), and the Southeast Asia Department \n(SERD) will be included in the pilot training programs under the RETA. The selection criteria will \ninclude (in no particular order) (i) the degree of importance attached to technological development \nand innovation in the country poverty reduction strategy and economic development plan, or ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership and strategy; (ii) the relevance of the training programs to the country\u2019s current \nand future ADB-assisted operations; and (iii) science, technology, and innovation indicators for the \ncountry according to statistics from the UNCTAD World Information Report, the UNESCO Science \nReport, and the World Economic Forum Report.  \n11.  To maximize the use of existing and available case studies and researches on this subject \nin developing the training program and to best reflect the needs of the pilot DMCs, the partner \ntraining  institute(s)  will  hire  30  eminent  professionals  in  this  area  from  universities,  research \ninstitutes,  NGOs,  and  private  institutes  in  the  PRC,  India,  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia, \nTaipei,China, Thailand, and the four pilot DMCs. These resource persons will participate in six \ncountry workshops and a regional conference to develop the content of the training programs and \nknowledge products. All workshops, training programs, and knowledge products will be in English \nand will not be translated into local languages for the pilot DMCs under the RETA. The key \nactivities of the RETA are as follows. \n12.  Identification of Good Asian Practices. The pilot DMCs will be consulted and their need \nfor public policies on technology and innovation determined. The initial conditions and endowments \nin those countries, as well as their specific needs and opportunities, will be examined. From this \nassessment, the related case studies and researches will be reviewed and evaluated, and good \nAsian practices in technology and innovation will be identified in the PRC, India, Republic of Korea, \nMalaysia, Thailand, and Taipei,China. Three to four cases will be chosen per economy, for a total \nof around 20 best-practice cases. Since several studies are already available for the Republic of \nKorea, Malaysia, Taipei,China, and Thailand, and to a lesser degree for the PRC and India, the \nuse of these available resources will be maximized and the work will focus more on identifying \ncrosscutting innovation issues and developing policy implications for the different historical and \ndevelopment contexts. \n13.  Development and Implementation of Training Programs. Two types of training courses \nwill be developed and implemented: (i) a 6-month certificate program for junior government officials, \nand (ii) a 2-week short-term executive program for senior government officials. These programs will \nmaximize existing training content, programs, and resources, and will be designed to enable the \nDMC participants, in the most interactive way, to develop practical solutions for their country, given \nthe specific constraints, and to design their own innovation policies through case studies and \nseminars. Knowledge products, to be disseminated to regional organizations as well as to the \nDMCs\u2019 universities and research institutes, will also be developed and packaged into relevant \ncontent and materials in both soft and hard formats.  \n ", "      5\n14.  Evaluation of Training Program and Development of Sustainability Mechanism. The \nperformance of the pilot training programs will be evaluated in this component. The partner training \ninstitute(s) will be asked to implement the monitoring and evaluation framework drawn up for the \ntraining programs. Participant feedback on the pilot programs obtained through interviews and \nsurveys will be evaluated. From this evaluation, a sustainability mechanism will be designed for the \ncontinuous  and  wider  implementation  of  the  training  programs.  At  the  countries\u2019  request, \ncountry-specific programs and action plans will also be formulated to ensure the sustainability of \nnational capacity-building efforts.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the RETA is $500,000 equivalent. This will be financed on a grant basis \nfrom the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, which is administered by \nADB. The amount will cover the consulting services, training programs, workshops, and resource \npersons. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  its  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment (RSDD) will administer the RETA, in close cooperation with resident missions and \ngovernments of the pilot DMCs, as well as other development partners and related NGOs. No \nactivities will be financed under this RETA in any ADB member until a letter of no objection \nregarding such activity has been received from the government of such member. Within ADB, the \nRETA will be implemented in maximum synergy with other existing technical assistance projects \nthat are relevant to knowledge sharing and networking in the region.10  \n17.  An international specialist will be hired by ADB on an individual basis for four months of \nintermittent service, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The specialist will (i) assess the needs of the pilot DMCs; (ii) prioritize the topics \nto be covered under the RETA; (iii) identify resource pools (studies, researches, and training \nprograms) in the selected priority areas; (iv) develop a bid document for selecting the partner \ntraining  institute(s)  and  draft  the  agreement(s);  and  (v)  facilitate  the  development  of  training \nprograms and knowledge products in cooperation with the partner training institute(s) and resource \npersons. The consultant must have expertise and experience in public policy (including technology \nand innovation), development economics and studies, and capacity-building programs. Outline \nterms of reference for the consultant are in Appendix 3. The RETA will be implemented for 24 \nmonths, from January 2008 to December 2009. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for the Knowledge- \nSharing Program Using Good Asian Practices in Innovation and Development, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultan t and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006.
