The Government of the Republic of Indonesia has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for preparing a gas transportation project \nthrough public-private partnership. The Fact-Finding Mission, conducted from 23 February to 5 \nMarch 2004, reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost \nestimates, and financing plan of, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1  A preliminary \nproject framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Among Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia is particularly well endowed with natural \ngas (gas) resources.  The current gas reserves are estimated at 177 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of \nwhich half (about 90 TCF) are proven.  At the current production rate (around 3 TCF per annum \nover the last 7 years), the reserves-production ratio is well over 50 years. About 70 percent of \nthe gas produced is exported, as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and through pipelines, and the \nbalance is consumed domestically. While some major reserves (East Kalimantan, offshore Riau, \nand Irian Jaya) are located far from the main consumption centers (West Java and East Java), \nsignificant reserves in South Sumatra (about 23 TCF) are available less than 600 kilometers \nfrom the Jakarta area. Government reports indicate some 7 TCF of remaining reserves in West \nJava alone, although these have not been developed. If this potential is realized, coupled with \nthe South Sumatra reserves, gas supply to the Java market should be secure for the medium \nterm. \n \n3.  With gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates in Indonesia expected to be, on \naverage, more than 4% per annum over the long term (to 2025), and the Government\u2019s planned \nwithdrawal of fuel subsidies,2 gas demand in Java is projected to grow at 4-8% per annum, \nbased on \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d GDP growth rates, thus trebling to sextupling the present level of \ndomestic gas consumption, to 3-6 billion cubic feet per day (BCFD), by 2025. The main drivers \nfor this rapid growth will be gas for power generation, and for residential and commercial uses, \nwhich are forecast to capture 65% and 27% of the total gas market by 2025, compared with \n54% and 22%, respectively, in 2003. The gas demand in West Java is projected to increase 2% \nper annum faster than that in Central and East Java, reaching 2-4 BCFD by 2025. \n \n4.   Indonesia has huge gas reserves and a strong domestic market for gas, but it lacks the \ngas infrastructure required to meet potential domestic demand, including that in Java. ADB has \npreviously assisted in developing gas transmission and distribution infrastructure in Sumatra \nand Batam, respectively, and was also involved in extending the Gresik-Duri gas transmission \npipeline system (in Sumatra) to Singapore. For developing downstream gas infrastructure in \nIndonesia, over the medium to long term, the participation of the private sector will be essential. \nUnder  its  earlier  intervention  (involving  the  gas  transmission  system  in  Sumatra),  ADB \nprecipitated the induction of a strategic investor in the state-owned gas company, PGN. To meet \nthe gas demand in Java beyond the medium term, two gas transportation options can be \nconsidered:  (i)  long-distance  gas  transmission  pipelines  (e.g.,  from  South  Sumatra,  East \nKalimantan, and Sulawesi), and  (ii) terminals in Java for receiving (and regasifying) LNG from \ncompetitive sources (e.g., from East Kalimantan, Western Papua, and Sulawesi). Although, \nbased on the projected level of gas demand in Java both gas transportation options may be \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 March 2004.  \n2  According to the government\u2019s program, fuel subsidies will be removed by the end of 2004, leaving only limited \nsubsidies for kerosene used by low-income households.   ", "2    \nviable in the long term, it is necessary to determine their complementarity and prioritize their \nimplementation, considering macroeconomics and a rational energy mix policy for the country. A \nproject will be prepared after an optimum gas transportation plan for Java has been formulated \nand the priority gas transportation scheme has been clearly identified. \n \n5.  In line with the country strategy and program (CSP) for 2003\u20132005, which was approved \nin October 2002, and its update in October 2003, the TA and the ensuing project will meet the \nfollowing three development objectives: (i) subregional integration, because the project will \ndevelop gas transportation links between various islands of Indonesia, which could form part of \nan integrated regional system; (ii) promotion of private sector participation, through effective \npublic-private sector partnership because the project will be designed to include private sector \ninvolvement; and (iii) promotion of clean and indigenous resources (natural gas, in this case) to \nmeet the country\u2019s energy requirements. \n \n6.  There is considerable potential for regional cooperation in the energy sector in the \nSoutheast  Asian  countries,  particularly  with  regard  to  cross-border  gas  transactions.  The \nAssociation  of  South  East  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Council  on  Petroleum  (ASCOPE)  has \nprepared a Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline Master Plan (2001), which indicates 175 TCF of proven \nand 94 TCF of probable gas reserves in ASEAN member countries. This large resource base \ncan support regional gas transportation from gas-rich countries (principally Indonesia), to gas-\ndeficient countries, for sustainable energy sector development in these countries. The ensuing \nproject will constitute an important element of regional gas trade. \n \n7.   Considering the magnitude of  investment envisaged for the ensuing project, and the \npublic resource constraints regarding financing for such a project, substantial private sector \ninvolvement will be necessary in project financing. However, there are certain significant factors \nthat are inhibiting private investment in Indonesia\u2019s gas sector. The new Oil and Gas Law, \ndesigned  to  liberalize  the  petroleum  sector,  was  passed  in  2001,  but  corresponding \nimplementing rules and regulations have not yet been introduced. Thus, there is no clarity \nregarding important features of the Law, including ownership and licensing of downstream \nbusinesses (processing, transportation, and trading), arrangements for regulating downstream \nactivities,  distribution  of  responsibilities  between  regional  governments  and  the  central \ngovernment for administering downstream businesses, and the mechanism for fulfilling the \ngovernment\u2019s  \u201csocial\u201d  obligations  with  regard  to  tariff  subsidies.  The  overall  tariff  regime \napplicable to the gas sector also needs to be made more transparent and rationalized in a \nmanner consistent with the planned phasing out of subsidies for liquid petroleum products. In \naddition  to  such  gas  sector-specific  issues,  certain  generic  issues  also  hold  back  private \ninvestment  such  as  institutional  effectiveness  and  capacity  of  the  executive  and  judicial \nbranches, transparency in regulation, and the enforceability of legal contracts. In this transition \nperiod, a public-private partnership arrangement limiting private investors\u2019 exposure will give \nthem some degree of comfort.  \n \n8.  The  World  Bank  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  have  been \nconsulted during the formulation of this TA. The World Bank is financing a gas distribution \nsystem in West Java, while JBIC is financing the South Sumatra-West Java gas transmission \npipeline. Both institutions have expressed interest, in principle, in cofinancing the ensuing gas \ntransportation project, as prioritized by the Government. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.   The TA aims to support the Government\u2019s strategy for promoting the domestic use of \nnatural gas in the interest of sustainable economic growth. The TA will comprise parts A and B. \nPart A will review gas transportation options for Java in the context of the Government\u2019s energy \nresource allocation/energy mix policy, formulate a gas transportation plan, and select the priority \ngas transportation scheme. Part B will prepare the gas transportation project. \n \n10.   The work in part A will help the Government select the optimum gas transportation \nscheme for Java. This work will take into account, among others, the findings of the Gas Sector \nDevelopment Plan, prepared with ADB assistance,3 and the Gas Pricing and Utilization Study \n(GPUS)  being  undertaken  with  World  Bank  assistance  (in  particular,  the  results  of  the \nassessment, under GPUS, of the projected gas market). These studies will help evaluate the \npotential for increasing the share of gas in the country\u2019s energy mix using appropriate policies, \nincluding a gas pricing policy. The priority gas transportation scheme will be selected after an \nevaluation of energy equilibrium models, national and regional development impacts, economic \nviability, and financial sustainability. \n \n11.  Part B will comprise detailed studies necessary to formulate and implement the ensuing \ngas transportation project, as identified/prioritized in part A. Specifically, part B will assess the \ngas market, undertake front-end engineering design, conduct environmental and social impact \nassessment, and prepare an \u201coptimum\u201d project structure and financing plan based on public-\nprivate  sector  partnership.  Ownership  of  downstream  gas  transportation  infrastructure  in \nIndonesia has traditionally been the exclusive domain of the public sector (with PGN and \nPertamina). With the sale of an equity interest in PGN\u2019s Sumatra assets, the private sector has \nbeen successfully introduced. The transition to full private sector ownership of downstream gas \ninfrastructure is, however, likely to take some time because of the nature of the business, \ncertain sector-specific constraints (paragraph 7), and the perceived country risk. The public-\nprivate partnership approach being proposed will build on a successful precedent, by providing \nan opportunity for collaboration between public sector entities and private entrepreneurs.       \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   Part A will be undertaken in two steps. Step 1 will involve these activities: (i) prepare an \ninventory of primary energy resources; (ii) compile production, transmission, and distribution \ndata for each type of commercial energy; (iii) prepare national and regional energy balances; \n(iv) develop a national, web-based energy database, with the on-line submission of information \nor data; and (v) review the current energy resource allocation/energy mix policy, with a view to \nformulating recommendations for gas sector development. Relevant computer hardware and \nsoftware will be acquired to support the establishment of the energy database, and to run \nmacroeconomic and energy equilibrium models. The equipment and software will be turned \nover to the Government upon completion of the TA, for institutional capacity strengthening. Step \n2 will review existing feasibility studies of gas transportation options for Java, including long-\ndistance gas transmission pipelines and LNG terminals, and determine the most cost-effective \nscheme for meeting the gas demand in Java. As a part of the review, potential environmental \nand social impacts as well as major environmental and social issues associated with the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for Preparing Gas Sector Development Plan. Manila. ", "4    \ntransportation options will be identified. A stakeholder consultation workshop will be held to \ndiscuss the results of part A.   \n \n13.   Part B of the TA will have the following activities: \n \n(i)  A  project-specific  gas  supply  and  demand  assessment  to  determine \npotential/uncommitted gas supply sources for Java, and the gas market in Java \nthrough a detailed market survey. \n \n(ii)  Front-end  engineering  design  for  the  selected  gas  transportation  scheme, \nincluding  preliminary  design,  cost  estimates,  procurement  packages,  and  a \nproject implementation schedule. \n \n(iii)  Financial  analysis  of  the  proposed  project,  and  a  financial  management \nassessment of the implementing agency, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects, and other \nADB guidelines. The analysis will review project financing options and determine \nan appropriate project structure/financing plan, based on public-private sector \npartnership, taking into account the legal and regulatory framework applicable to \nthe gas sector. \n \n(iv)  Economic  analysis  of  the  proposed  project,  including  sensitivity  analyses, \naccording to ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  The \nanalysis  will  include  alternatives  analysis,  rate  of  return  analysis,  sensitivity \nanalysis, risk analysis, financial impact analysis, and distribution analysis. \n \n(v)  Environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the proposed project in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and Environment Assessment Guideline (2003) \nand  Indonesian  environmental  laws.  If  the  initial examination indicates that \nsignificantly adverse environmental impacts are likely, a detailed EIA will be \nconducted, including a summary EIA, mitigating measures will be proposed and \ncosts related to the mitigation of significantly adverse environmental impacts will \nbe identified. Available information suggests that the environmental category of \nthe project is likely to be A or B. \n \n(vi)  Social and poverty analysis and impact assessment of the proposed project. This \ntask includes preparing (i) a social and poverty analysis report, consistent with \nthe requirements of ADB\u2019s  Handbook for Social and Poverty Analysis; (ii) for \nproject  components  involving  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  a  Land \nAcquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (LARAP), consistent with ADB\u2019s policy \non involuntary resettlement as detailed in the ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement; \nand  (iii)  for  project  components  eventually  involving  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples\u2019 communities, an indigenous peoples development plan, consistent with \nthe requirements of ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.15 million equivalent, comprising foreign \nexchange  of  $684,000  and  local  currency  of  $466,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $910,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$226,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis ", "  5\nby the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government and PGN will \ncontribute the remaining cost in kind by providing office accommodation in Jakarta, counterpart \nstaff time input, secretarial support, and workshops. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing  project.  Detailed cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  BAPPENAS (through its Directorate of Energy, Communication and Informatics) will be \nthe Executing Agency and Implementing Agency for part A, and will work in close collaboration \nwith MIGAS, PGN, and other stakeholders. BAPPENAS will assign a project coordinator and \ncounterpart staff to work with the TA consultants. MIGAS and PGN will assign suitable staff to \nwork  with  BAPPENAS  and  the  consultants.  PGN  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and \nImplementing Agency for part B and will assign a project coordinator and counterpart staff to \nwork with the consultants. MIGAS will also assign counterpart staff to work with PGN and the \nconsultants. A steering committee will be established, headed by BAPPENAS, to monitor and \ncoordinate work for parts A and B.  \n \n16.  The TA will be carried out over 11 months (3 months for Part A, 7 months for Part B, and \none month between these two parts) starting in October 2004 and ending in August 2005. An \ninternational consulting firm will be selected for both parts, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. The full technical proposal process and the quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedure will be used in selecting the consulting firm. Research institutions and universities in \nIndonesia may participate as domestic consultants. All procurement under the TA will follow \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n17.  The TA will require about 21 person-months of international and 46 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. Depending on the priority gas transportation scheme selected, it \nmay be necessary to deploy additional consulting resources (beyond those allocated under this \nTA) to prepare an optimum project structure based on public-private partnership. Outline terms \nof reference are included in Appendix 4. The consultants will prepare inception, draft final, and \nfinal reports for part A, due 2 weeks, 9 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively, after the start of \nservices. A consultative workshop will be held after the draft final report for part A is submitted. \nThe consultants will prepare inception, draft final, and final reports for part B, due 2 weeks, 6 \nmonths and 7 months, respectively, after the services start. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $910,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for preparing the Gas Transportation Project Through Public- \nPrivate Partnership, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n  ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT LOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \nSupport the Government\u2019s  Improved energy supply  Country economic   \nstrategy for developing the gas  reliability   and energy sector   \nsector to promote sustainable    statistics    \neconomic growth     \n  Sector review \n \nPurpose       \nReview energy resources  Increased use of clean,  Review missions  Assumption: \nallocation/ energy mix policy,  indigenous, and competitive    Adequate \nand optimize gas transportation  energy resources for power  Project  information and data \nscheme for Java  generation, and industrial,  implementation   \n  commercial, and household  progress reports and  Risks: \n  applications  completion  Continuation of \n      liquid fuel subsidies \nPrepare and implement the gas  Java gas demand is met  Project Performance   \ntransportation project    Audit Report  Lack of private \n    sector interest \n   \nFinancing \nconstraints \n  \nOutputs (of the TA) a       \nPart A      Assumption: \n      Availability and \nInventories of existing energy  Availability of an energy  TA review missions  reliability of \nresources, and production,  database as planning tool for    necessary data and \ntransmission and distribution  the energy sector   TA reports  statistics \ndata by type of commercial       \nenergy    Tripartite meetings  Risk: \n      Weak performance \nDevelopment of a national  Final report reviewed and  TA Completion  of consultants \nenergy database including  accepted by the Government  Report \nprovision for web-based on-line  and ADB in accordance with \nsubmission of information  the TOR \n \nReview of current energy mix \nand recommending appropriate \nnational energy mix policy for \ndevelopment of the gas sector \n \nReview of existing feasibility \nstudies of gas transportation \noptions including LNG terminals \nin Java and long-distance \npipelines  \n \nDetermination of the most cost-\neffective transportation scheme \nto meet gas demand in Java \n \n \n           Continued on next page ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n \nLOGICAL FRAMEWORK\u2014Continued  \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \n       \nPart B \n       \nMarket assessment \n \nFront-end engineering  \n \nFinancial analysis \n \nEconomic analysis \n \nEnvironmental impact \nassessment            \n  \nSocial impact assessment   \n       \nInputs (of the TA)       \nConsulting services  Consultants recruited in  TA review missions  Assumptions: \n  October 2004.

The analysis will particularly assess effects in production \nactivities, the ability of the poor to benefit from job opportunities, and \nsustainability of poverty reduction effects. To the extent possible, the \nanalysis will discern the effects of employment opportunities on gender. \nThe analysis will also assess the causality between energy demand and \neconomic growth, sector growth patterns, and the effects on poverty \nreduction. \n \nThe poverty analysis will identify monitorable proxy indicators for assessing \nthe poverty impact of the proposed project. \n \nC.
