INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During discussions for the country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB),1 the Government of Mongolia requested ADB to provide \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for Coal to Cleaner Fuel Conversion for Heating in \nGer District and Power Generation.2 The proposed TA will promote the production and use of \ncleaner fuel from a coal-to-liquid (CTL) process. The technology will capitalize on abundant \ndomestic coal resources for heating and power generation while reducing air pollution and \ndependence on imports of petroleum products. \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132016  for \nMongolia, which underscores the need to (i) foster energy security, (ii) reduce emissions of \npollutants from heating and power generation facilities for urban environment improvement, (iii) \nexplore ways of using cleaner fuel for power generation and heating supply, and (iv) promote \nprivate sector investment in energy infrastructure.3 The concept paper was approved on 24 \nOctober  2014.  During  the  fact-finding  mission,  ADB  and  the  government  reached  an \nunderstanding on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and outline of \nterms of reference for the TA consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Energy security, climate change, and air pollution are major challenges common to most \nof ADB\u2019s developing member countries, especially those with fossil fuel-based economies. \nMongolia is one of these countries. Coal is abundant and is the only fossil fuel available in the \ncountry.4 Mongolia depends almost entirely on domestic coal production and imported oil for its \nenergy supply. Energy security concerns are rising because of oil price volatility and its sharp \nincreases in the past. Political instability in major oil-producing countries and the formidable \ndifficulties of transporting oil in landlocked Mongolia have compounded these concerns. The \nconsumption of petroleum products is growing rapidly in parallel with economic growth fueled by \nthe country\u2019s mining sector.5 Every year, Mongolia spends a higher percentage of its foreign \nexchange reserves on oil imports.6 It also experiences frequent supply shortages because of \nvulnerabilities across the supply chain. This is causing a ripple effect on mining and industry\u2014\nits main economic sectors. \n \n4.  Air  pollution  from  conventional  fuels  is  also  taking  a  toll  on  Mongolians\u2019  health. \nCombustion of solid fuels, such as firewood and coal, in household heating stoves and cooking \nin Ger District of Ulaanbaatar causes indoor pollution, which leads to respiratory diseases.7 \nSolid  fuel  combustion  is  also  the  largest  contributor  to  outdoor  particulate  matter  in \nUlaanbaatar.8 Ger districts are not connected to Ulaanbaatar\u2019s district heating system, so ger \nresidents must use coal and wood for heating during the cold winters, which last for 6\u20138 months. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 October 2014. \n3  ADB. 2014. Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n4  Mongolia is estimated to have 6.2 million tons of oil reserves. All locally produced oil is exported to refineries in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China because there are no in-country refineries. \n5  Mongolia imported 1.1 million tons of oil in 2012 and consumption is expected to reach 2.5 million tons in 2020. \n6  Mongolia paid about $1.4 billion for petroleum product imports\u201421% of total import payments in 2012. \n7  A ger is a tent-like dwelling used by nomadic people. The ger districts are mainly inhabited by people who cannot \nafford to live in apartments. \n8  These pollutants include carbon monoxide, volatile organic carbons (including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and \nacetone), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (including black carbon). \n ", "2  \nThe population of Ger District has been rising because of an influx of migrants from rural areas \nseeking employment opportunities in Ulaanbaatar.9 This is increasing the use of conventional \nfuels, adding to the worsening air pollution problem.10 A World Bank report attributes about 11% \nof premature deaths in the city to air pollution, and estimates the social cost at about $177 \nmillion\u2013$727 million a year.11 The World Health Organization (WHO) ranked Ulaanbaatar as the \ncity with the second-worst air pollution in the world.12 The WHO study found that 60%\u201390% of \nthe air pollution is caused by raw coal and wood combustion for heating and cooking in Ger \nDistrict. \n \n5.  Most of the electricity demand in Mongolia is met by coal-fired power plants, which have \nlimited flexibility to change their output in timely manner in response to the commands of the \ngrid operator. Although Mongolia has abundant renewable energy resources, such as wind and \nsolar, capitalizing on these sources remains a challenge because the power system lacks the \nregulating capacity to cope with the power fluctuation from power plants based on renewable \nenergy. \n \n6.  In view of these challenges, Mongolia is seeking to explore alternative fuel solutions to (i) \ndecrease dependence on oil imports and thereby improve energy security, (ii) reduce air and \nsoil pollution in Ulaanbaatar caused by coal combustion for heating and cooking in Ger District, \nand (iii) install regulating capacity such as gas-based power plants in the power system for \nabsorbing renewable energy-based power. One option is to consider CTL technology, which \nwould use domestic coal to produce petroleum products and clean gas fuels.13 The benefits of \nCTL are particularly important for Mongolia, with its large reserves of coal14 and dependence on \noil imports. CTL could produce alternative fuel cost-effectively, particularly when international oil \nprices are consistently high. It can help the country develop strategic gasoline- and diesel-\nequivalent reserves to overcome frequent supply interruptions. Combined with technology for \ncapturing carbon dioxide emissions from these plants and sequestering them geologically\u2014a \nprocess known as carbon capture and storage\u2014CTL plants can reduce associated carbon \ndioxide emissions by 90%.15 \n \n7.  But such CTL plants, due to their complexity and size, are capital intensive and will \nrequire  large  private  investment.  ADB  has  supported  Mongolia  in  reforming  its  regulatory \nframework  to  attract  private  investment,  leading  to  a  successful  large  scale  public\u2013private \n                                                 \n9  About 42% of the population of Mongolia lives in Ulaanbaatar and 58% of its residents (about 186,000 households) \nlive in ger districts.  \n10 During the long winter months, particulate matter of less than 10 micrometers in diameter in Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \natmosphere routinely measures 279 micrograms per cubic meter\u2014about 5 times higher than the air quality \nguidelines of 50 micrograms per cubic meter of the World Health Organization (WHO). \n11 World Bank. 2011. Air Quality Analysis Ulaanbaatar: Improving Air Quality to Reduce Health Impacts. Washington, \nDC. \n12 WHO. 2012. World Health Statistics. Geneva. \n13 CTL is the process of coal liquefaction, during which many pollutants, including sulfur, can be removed. Coal \nliquefaction first gasifies the coal with steam to form a syngas. Sulfur is removed from this gas and the mixture \nadjusted according to the desired product. The syngas is then condensed over a catalyst, using the Fischer\u2013\nTropsch process\u2014to produce high-quality, ultraclean products. Dimethyl ether\u2014a byproduct of coal-to-liquid\u2014is an \nenvironmentally clean gas suitable for heating and cooking. It is convenient to transport and generates no sulfur \noxide or soot. It can also be used as an alternative to diesel for transport, as well as to generate electricity. \n14 Mongolia has proven reserves of 12.2 billion tons of coal, including 2.0 billion tons of coking coal and 10.1 billion \ntons of thermal coal. \n15 R.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  The TA will help the government (i) undertake a feasibility analysis of CTL; (ii) review the \nlegal  and  regulatory  framework  for  implementing  CTL  projects,  including  energy  security \nstrategy and policies; (iii) identify and propose measures to stimulate private sector interest in \nCTL projects; and (iv) recommend measures to create an enabling environment for investments \nfor CTL projects.17 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be improved air quality and energy security in Mongolia due to cleaner \nfuel supply from CTL. By 2025, a large-scale CTL project will have been implemented, more \nthan 20% of low-quality petroleum products will have been replaced by the clean gas fuel and \nhigh-quality petroleum products, Ulaanbaatar\u2019s air pollution index and Mongolia\u2019s trade balance \nwill have improved, and imports of petroleum products will have declined. The outcome will be \nan  enabling  environment  for  CTL  established  by  2016.  This  will  be  indicated  by  the  (i) \ndevelopment  and  approval  by  the  government  of  a  CTL  feasibility  assessment  and \nimplementation  plan,  (ii)  tabling  before  the  Mongolian  legislature  of  policy  and  regulatory \nchanges in favor of CTL, and (iii) approval by the government of gas fuel safety rules and \nassociated infrastructures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The key outputs of the TA include (i) technical  and  economic  feasibility  of  CTL \nestablished,  (ii)  policy  and  regulatory  environment  assessed,  (iii)  CTL  implementation  plan \ndeveloped, and (iv) TA findings and recommendations disseminated. \n \n11.  The  main  assumptions  are  that  timely  investments  are  made  in  CTL  projects;  the \ngovernment remains committed to CTL projects; feasibility assessment are positive; and timely \naccess  is  given  to  records,  information,  and  personnel.  The  main  risks  of  the  TA  are  (i) \ngovernment inaction discourages investments, (ii) gas fuel safety rules are not in place and \nassociated infrastructures are not built, (iii) CTL is found not to be feasible in Mongolia, (iv) the \ngovernment considers the associated policy and regulatory needs to be too demanding, and (v)  \nthe local counterpart\u2019s performance is weak. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.   The TA is estimated to cost $350,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide counterpart support \n                                                 \n16 ADB\u2019s public sector initiated and supported the preparation of the feasibility study for 450 megawatt combined heat \nand power plant number 5 (CHP5), estimated to cost nearly $1 billion in Ulaanbaatar using a public\u2013private \npartnership modality.

The government and the concessionaire are negotiating a concession \nagreement with support from ADB\u2019s transaction advisory team. \n17 Actions including providing stable and favorable commercial environment in terms of legal, tax regimes, incentives \nto attract foreign and domestic investments, and supporting the implementation of gas fuel market by renewing \nsafety rules. \n ", "4  \nin  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  logistics,  facilities,  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff, \nstudies,  reports,  data  and  requisite  information,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Mining and Energy. The implementing \nagency will be the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia. The TA will be implemented over \n13 months, from 1 February 2015 to 29 February 2016. It will require 6 person-months of inputs \nfrom international experts and 15 person-months of inputs from national experts. The executing \nagency and implementing agency will be supported by a working group with representatives \nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Green  Development,  and \nUlaanbaatar City\u2019s Air Quality Department. The working group will provide overall strategic \ndirection and review the outputs of the consultants. Periodic meetings will be organized for the \nworking group to discuss the progress of the TA. \n \n14.  A firm with a team of international experts (6 person-months) and national consultants \n(15 person-months) with expertise in energy economics, coal gasification, financial analysis, \nand environmental assessment will be hired to conduct the study using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-\nbased selection method (with a technical\u2013financial weighting of 90:10), following submission of \nbiodata technical proposal. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as \namended time to time) will be followed and the shopping method will be used to procure the \nequipment under the TA. Equipment will be used by the consultants during implementation and \nhanded over to the executing agency upon completion of the TA. Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n15.  The TA will be monitored based on the consultants\u2019 progress report, and TA review \nmissions. Two workshops will be organized for the interim and draft final report consultation, \ninviting  government  officials,  licensed  power  companies,  potential  investors,  donors,  and \nmembers of Parliament. The overall results of the TA and lessons learned from other similar \nCTL projects will be disseminated through workshops, trainings, and study tours. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for the Coal to Cleaner Fuel Conversion for Heating in Ger District \nand Power Generation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved air quality and  A large-scale CTL project  Statistical bulletin of  Investments in CTL project \nenergy security in  implemented by 2025  National Statistical Office of  are timely \nMongolia due to cleaner    Mongolia on petroleum   \nfuel supply from CTL  More than 20% of low-quality  products production and  Risks \npetroleum products and dirty  import  Government inaction \ncoal replaced by clean gas    discourages investment \nfuel and high-quality  Statistical bulletin of   \npetroleum products by 2025  National Statistical Office of  Gas fuel safety rules are \n(none in 2012)  Mongolia on health  not in place and \n  situation  associated infrastructures \nAir pollution index improved    are not built \nby 2025  National statistics \n \nImports of petroleum products \ndecline by 2025 (1.2 million \ntons in 2012) \n       \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnabling environment  CTL feasibility assessment  Government resolutions,  Government remains \nfor CTL established by  accepted by the government  policies approved  committed to CTL projects \n2016  by 2016     \n  ADB sector assessment  Feasibility assessment \nCTL implementation plan  report in 2016  outcome is positive \napproved by the government   \nby 2016  Risks \n  CTL is found not to be \nPolicy and regulatory  feasible for Mongolia \nchanges in favor of CTL   \ntabled before the Mongolian  Associated policy and \nlegislature by 2016  regulatory needs are \n  considered too demanding \nGas fuel safety rules and  by the government \nassociated infrastructures are \napproved by the government \nby 2016 \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
