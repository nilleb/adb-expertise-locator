Mongolia is a large, sparsely populated country located between the People\u2019s Republic \nof China to the south and the Russian Federation to the north. As a result of rapid growth in \nmining, it has become one of Asia\u2019s fastest-growing economies. However, mining is capital \nintensive and creates only limited employment opportunities, so poverty levels remain high. In \n2011,  about  29.8%  of  the  population  lived  below  the  poverty  line,  with  a  high  degree  of \ninequality between rural and urban areas. To reduce poverty the government will need to \ntransform resource-driven economic growth into a more broad-based development. This will \nrequire development of productive non-mining sectors and expansion of people\u2019s access to \neconomic opportunities and services in order to make growth more inclusive. \n \n2.  With a population of 3.2 million people and a land area of 1.6 million square kilometers \n(km2), Mongolia\u2019s average population density is only 2 persons per km2. Since more than \n1.2 million people now live in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, the population density of the rest of \nthe country is close to 1 person per km2. To improve economic competitiveness, expand access \nto economic opportunities and services, and enable economic development in the different \nregions, the government attaches high priority to improving the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. \nThis includes improving connectivity between Mongolia and neighboring countries, between the \ncapital and provincial centers, and between provincial centers and surrounding regions. \n \n3.  The Government of Mongolia has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for policy \nand advisory technical assistance (TA) to help it refine its transport sector policies, strategy, and \ninvestment plans. Following initial discussions on 15\u201327 April 2013, this TA report is based on \nan understanding reached with the government during the TA fact-finding mission on 8\u20139 July \n2013 and through further discussions on 12\u201323 August 2013. It reflects the consensus reached \non the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, \nand  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  for  the  TA.1 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The Mongolian transport sector covers the air, road, and rail transport modes.2 Despite \nthe large territory, there are only 49,300 kilometers (km) of main roads, of which only 2,950 km \nare paved. With an average of 31 meters per km2, road density is similar to other scarcely \npopulated countries such as Australia, Canada, and Kazakhstan. The reliance on unpaved \nroads  imposes  high  transportation  costs.  The  country\u2019s  air  transportation  system  includes \n23 airports, of which Chinggis Khaan Airport in Ulaanbaatar serves as the country\u2019s international \nand domestic hub. Only four domestic airports have paved runways and are equipped with \nbasic navigation aids. The Mongolian rail network comprises 1,815 km of broad-gauge track, of \nwhich 1,110 km are on the main line linking the Russian Federation to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, 238 km are on a separate network in eastern Mongolia that also links to the Russian \nrailway, and the remaining 477 km are branches off the main line. \n \n5.  Freight transport grew at an average annual rate of 13% from 2000 to 2012, reaching \n16.6 billion ton-km. In 2012, nearly 73% of total freight was transported by rail, most of the \nremainder by road transport, and a small portion by air. Rail is the dominant transport mode for \ncommercial cargo and mineral exports. Between 2000 and 2012, passenger transport increased \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 August 2013. \n2  Inland water transportation is insignificant. \n ", "2   \nfrom 1.94 billion passenger-km to 4.97 billion passenger-km, equivalent to an average annual \ngrowth rate of 7%. In 2012, road transport accounted for 45% of total passenger transport, rail \nfor 30%, and air for 25%. The fastest-growing transport mode was road transport, which grew at \nan average annual rate of 18%; air transport grew at 9% and rail transport at 4%. \n \n6.  International transport connections are crucial for integrating Mongolia\u2019s comparatively \nsmall and isolated economy into the large and growing regional markets. Efficient domestic \ntransport connectivity is necessary for providing the rural population with access to markets, \nemployment  opportunities,  and  social  and  health-care  services.  Yet  the  country\u2019s  size, \ngeography, climate, and low population density present special challenges for transport network \ndevelopment due to the very high cost of creating and maintaining transport infrastructure and \nthe  limited  traffic  volumes  to  be  served.  The  transport  systems  in  countries  with  similar \ngeographic and/or climatic challenges\u2014i.e., Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, and the United \nStates  (particularly  Alaska)\u2014may  provide  lessons  on  how  to  meet  these  challenges.  The \nincreasing concentration of population in Ulaanbaatar also requires a radical improvement of the \ncity\u2019s transport system.  \n \n7.  If the government seeks transport service levels that are too high, this may lead to an \ninefficient use of resources and may burden the country with high costs for operation and \nmaintenance  of  overdeveloped  infrastructure.  The  government  needs  to  establish  sound \nprinciples for planning and prioritizing transport network development, and ensure that transport \ninvestments will be financially and economically viable.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA will assist the government in refining its vision for transport sector development \nduring 2016\u20132025, and will also identify the scope for partnership with ADB in developing the \nsector  during  2016\u20132018.  This  will  include  reviewing  the  government\u2019s  transport  sector \nstrategies, policies, and investment plans; assessing transport sector issues and opportunities; \nand drawing upon comparisons with transport systems in countries that have faced similar \ngeographic  and  demographic  challenges.  The  TA  is  in  line  with  the  Mongolia  country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u201320163 and National Development Strategy,4 which both place high \npriority  on  transport  sector  development.  TA  scope  is  in  line  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nTransport Initiative.5 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved national and international transport connectivity \nfor Mongolia. The expected outcome is a refined transport sector investment program for 2016\u2013\n2018. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  a  situation  analysis  of  the  transport  system  in \nMongolia, including a comparison with similar countries; (ii) an analytical review of proposed \ntransport sector investments for 2016\u20132025 (roads, rail, aviation); and (iii) transport project \nproposals for ADB financing in 2016\u20132018.  \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2012.
