The People\u2019s Republic of China (the PRC) has been urbanizing rapidly over the last two \ndecades, largely due to migration of surplus rural labor seeking secondary and tertiary urban \nemployment, and the changing definition of urban areas. The Government has highlighted \nurbanization  as  a  key  policy  area  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  (2001\u20132005) and is \ncontinuing to work out strategies, policies, and programs designed to influence the scope and \npattern  of  urbanization.1  During  the  2003  Country  Programming  Review  Mission,  the \nGovernment  reconfirmed  its  request  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  technical \nassistance (TA) to review the PRC\u2019s urbanization strategies, focusing on effectively applying the \npolicy  of  favoring  town  development.2  The  ADB  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the  PRC  in \nNovember 2003 and reached an understanding with the National Development and Reform \nCommission (NDRC) and concerned national ministries on the TA goals, purpose, output, cost \nestimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements.3 The TA framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  With rapid economic development and the transition from a command to a market \neconomy, more and more people are moving into urban areas, and, more significantly, large \nelements of the rural economy are becoming urban. Urban populations increased from 300 \nmillion (26% of the total) in 1990 to 481 million (38%) in 2001, and over half the population is \nexpected to be urban well before 2020. These figures underreport the scale and speed of \nurbanization  since  many  people  still  counted  in  the  agriculture  sector  actually  work  in \nnonagricultural jobs and are living in urbanizing areas. Urbanization has been driven by the \nmigration of surplus rural labor, expected to number 150 million people over the next 15 years. \nThe  PRC  sees  urbanization  as  a  way  to  reduce  rural-urban  inequalities  and  sustain  the \ncountry\u2019s transition to a market economy.4 While it can greatly help reduce inequalities because \nurban  productivity  is  many  times  higher  than  agricultural  employment,  if  inappropriately \nimplemented urbanization can severely disrupt not only the lives of the rural poor who must \nmove to urbanizing areas and learn new skills, but also existing urban systems. A wide range of \nissues such as those related to resettlement, housing, infrastructure, and social services may \narise. Much depends on the location, scale, and management of urban growth. \n \n3.  To accommodate urban growth, the PRC promotes towns while controlling the growth of \nlarge cities. To manage the transition of much of the rural population from agricultural to urban \nemployment and from rural to urban environments, the PRC attempts to channel population \nmovements away from large cities toward smaller settlements. This has been happening over \nthe last decade as the emerging town and village enterprise sector has stimulated growth in \nsome suburban nodes and towns in the hinterlands of major central cities. The scope of this \nphenomenon has varied across urban areas and from region to region. The most successful \ntowns  have  been  those  integrated  into  growing  urban  or  metropolitan  regions.  Towns  in \nprovinces with underdeveloped urban systems, and those that are geographically isolated, have \ngenerally not performed as well. \n \n4.  Enterprise reform and restructuring are swelling the ranks of the urban unemployed. \nReform of state-owned enterprises and restructuring of town and village enterprises place even \ngreater pressure on local governments to provide jobs and services for a growing low-income \n                                                 \n1  Preparation of the 11th FYP (2006\u20132010) is just beginning, and urbanization will be a key topic.  \n2  Towns in this report include statutory towns with 50,000\u2013150,000 people.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 January 2003.  \n4  Urban incomes are about three times rural incomes. ", "2 \npopulation. Urbanization will involve construction of new settlements, reconstruction of existing \nsettlements,  and  major  infrastructure  programs  that  may  require  resettlement.  Town \ndevelopment should minimize displacement and dispossession, which are the main causes of \nurban  poverty.5  Public  participation  strengthens  stakeholder  ownership  of  the  urbanization \nprocess and should be encouraged.  \n \n5.  To develop a workable urbanization strategy for towns requires identifying the types of \ntowns with potential to develop economically and attract a significant number of migrants. Such \ntowns might have different physical, environmental, social, and economic characteristics. They \nmay be settlements near large cities or metropolitan areas or along major transport links, or in \nareas with unique natural resources. The strategy needs to identify towns with development \npotential and to determine how different types of towns can help achieve national and provincial \neconomic development objectives.  \n \n6.  Towns require large amounts of capital investment. This has come mostly from national \nand provincial governments, but their budgets are becoming increasingly restricted. Many towns \ndo not have the capacity to raise sufficient funds on their own. A weak revenue base and \nincreasing expenditures result in the use of various fees that are not transparent and can hinder \nefforts to attract investors. The emerging market economy creates opportunities for towns to \nattract private sector investment into housing, industry, infrastructure, transportation, and other \nsectors, but towns are small and inexperienced. Job creation will be the key to their success, \nwhich will increasingly depend on the climate they create for private sector investment. To \nattract private sector investment towns should develop market-based  incentives  and  price \nmechanisms tailored to their conditions and capacities. This will be a gradual process since \nmost towns have no experience with such tools, and, for at least the short term, public sector \ninvestment will be required to develop the facilities and services required for urbanization. \nMunicipal  finance  should  be  effectively  planned  and  managed  to  ensure  sustainable  town \ndevelopment.6 \n \n7.  Rapid urbanization will create serious environmental problems. Most settlements of the \nsize being studied lack wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure and the means to \nproperly dispose of solid waste, and new industries could worsen air quality. Not all towns have \nfunctioning environmental protection bureaus, so monitoring and enforcement of environmental \nregulations are inadequate.7 Joint provision of environmental infrastructure among towns and \nsecondary cities (which would be cost-effective) is rare.  \n \n8.  For many towns in the hinterlands of major cities, the issue is not stimulating growth. \nThese towns are either already growing rapidly or will do so as their urban regions develop. In \nother cases, however, towns are not developing to their potential due to lack of funds or \nexpertise, poor links to markets, resources that are not being fully used, and other factors. \nTowns near large cities, especially, must structure growth to become economically efficient, \nserviceable  at  a  reasonable  cost,  and  livable.  Without  a  regional  approach  to  guide  the \ndevelopment of smaller centers within an urban region, the trends can lead to uncontrolled \nsprawl and extensive environmental pollution. Practical and effective policy instruments should \nbe established to produce compact, well-serviced, and well-connected towns while minimizing \nscattered development. Growth should also be managed and solutions to problems in urban \ninfrastructure, transport, environment, finance, social services, and others explored. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1999.

The  ADB  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP)  (2003\u20132007)  supports  the  PRC\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy and is designed to \u201cpromote pro-poor economic growth by enabling the \npoor to have greater access to opportunities and benefits of economic prosperity.\u201d The program \naims to (i) reduce inequalities, (ii) make markets work better, (iii) improve the environment, and \n(iv) promote regional cooperation. A workable urbanization strategy, particularly for the poor \ntowns, can significantly promote pro-poor economic growth. For many years ADB has had an \nactive urban sector program largely to build specific infrastructure and transport projects in large \nurban areas and to improve the urban environment. ADB\u2019s program has only recently begun to \ndirectly address the problems of towns.8 This TA, which will cover urbanization in towns in a \nbroad context and at a policy level, is in line with the goals of the CSP and will help the \nGovernment develop the economy and reduce poverty.9  \n \n10.  The urban sector has received considerable assistance from other multilateral and \nbilateral development partners. The World Bank is studying urbanization policies, including \nthree  case-study  provinces\u2014Henan,  Sichuan,  and  Zhejiang.  The  World  Bank,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wideraufbau (KfW), United Kingdom \nDepartment  for  International  Development,  and  others  have  supported  water  supply  and \nwastewater treatment projects in many large cities, as well as more comprehensive urban \nenvironmental projects. The TA will be implemented in close collaboration with the World Bank \nand other partners to ensure that the TA output will complement their work. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Government strengthen its urbanization strategies, \nwith a focus on establishing sound town development approaches.  The goal is to achieve \npatterns of urban settlement that contribute to efficient growth, poverty reduction, and improved \nurban environmental quality.  \n \n12.  The expected TA outputs include (i) two provincial case studies for immediate use by the \nprovinces to formulate and implement town development strategies and provide ideas for \noutputs (ii) and (iii); (ii) an analysis of the problems in applying national and provincial town \ndevelopment policies, culminating in identifying policy barriers; and (iii) recommendations for \nchange,  including  international  best  practices,  process  guidelines  for  town  planning,  and \napproaches to attracting investment, including from the private sector, in town development. \nThe two case studies will be models for developing town-based urbanization strategies in other \nparts of the country by documenting, and analyzing the reasons for, the success stories.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002.

Manila (Loan 1985-PRC, for $82.36 \nmillion),  approved  on  19  December  2002,  and  the  proposed  Henan  wastewater  management  project  and \nShandong Hai River basin pollution control project which are included in the PRC country program for 2004 and \n2005 respectively, are all focused on small cities and towns in the Hai River basin.  \n9  The TA is a potential candidate for partnership with the City Alliance, of which ADB is a member. The organization \nis a global alliance of cities and their development partners committed to improve the living conditions of the urban \npoor through advocacy and promotion of specific actions to (i) promote pro-poor city development strategies, and \n(ii) develop citywide and nationwide slum-upgrading programs. ADB is processing a second regional TA for its \nparticipation in the alliance. ", "4 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will consist of three parts: A\u2014formulating strategic urbanization models based \non the two provincial case studies, B\u2014analyzing problems in applying existing policies, and C\u2014\nrecommending policy changes. \n \n14.  Under part A, the consultants will design and carry out two provincial case studies. Using \ntwo provinces with different histories and patterns of urbanization, the consultants will document \nthe  pattern  of  urban  settlement  in  the  province,  identify  towns  with  potential  to  develop \neconomically and absorb migrant labor, and assess policy instruments that can support these \nprocesses. The provinces chosen for study are Liaoning, in the northeast, with an old and \ndeteriorating industrial base and high unemployment; and Shanxi, in the central region, with an \neconomy  based  on  secondary  industry  and  coal.10  Both  are  among  the  slower-growing \nprovinces economically and face social and environmental problems resulting from enterprise \nreform and industrial restructuring.  \n \n15.  Under part B, the consultants will (i) review and assess national and provincial data on \nurbanization conditions and trends; (ii) review and assess existing government policies and \nprograms to influence patterns of urban development; (iii) analyze problems in the design and \nimplementation of existing policies, including planning, financing, institutional arrangements, and \ntown management; and (iv) identify policy barriers to effective urbanization and development of \ntowns. \n \n16.  Under part C, the consultants will (i) collect and present international best practices in \nthe field of channeling growth to secondary centers; (ii)  identify policy instruments that are \nworkable in a market economy; (iii) identify the types of towns that should be considered as \npriorities; (iv) develop process guidelines for town planning and development management, \nincluding  guidelines  for  public  participation  in  planning;  (v)  analyze  problems  in  attracting \ninvestment, including from the private sector, to towns and suggest ways to overcome these \nproblems; and (vi) based on the analyses of part B and what was learned from the case studies, \npropose policy changes to overcome the barriers identified, and an implementation strategy to \nmake the changes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,000,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 is \nthe foreign exchange cost and $500,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $750,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $250,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe  Government  of  Spain  ($500,000)  and  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  ($250,000).  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  provide  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to \n$250,000, for counterpart staff, office space, furniture, and administrative support. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  NDRC  will  be  the  TA  Executing  Agency  and  provide  policy  guidance,  facilitate \ninteragency coordination, and resolve any institutional problems. NDRC will appoint a senior \n                                                 \n10 ADB is processing loans in each of these provinces: Coal-Bed Methane-Greenhouse Gas Abatement Project in \nShanxi, and Liaoning Environmental Improvement Project (pollution control). ", "    5 \nofficer  as  project  manager,  assisted  by  other  qualified  counterpart  staff,  and  assign  two \nprofessional staff to help the consultants in Beijing. NDRC will assure the cooperation of the \ncase-study provinces in working with the consultants and facilitating their work. If necessary, \nNDRC will also assure the participation of other relevant ministries, including the ministries of \nfinance, construction, and lands and resources; and the State Environmental Protection Agency \nduring TA implementation. Office space and facilities will be provided in Beijing by NDRC, and \nin the two provinces by the provincial planning commissions. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months, from April to December 2004. The total input \nof  the  consultants  is  estimated  at  53  person-months  (16  person-months international, 37 \nperson-months domestic). The international consulting team will provide a team leader with \nbroad experience in all aspects of the urban sector, and a total of four specialists in urban \neconomics, social development/poverty reduction, urban infrastructure, and municipal finance. \nThe domestic team will include a deputy team leader with expertise in urban planning and a \ntotal  of  eight  specialists  in  urban  development,  urban  economics,  social  analysis  and \nassessments, environmental management, transportation planning, institutional analysis, and \nmunicipal finance. Two of the consultants on the domestic team will be recruited in the case-\nstudy provinces. The consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s  \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants based on the quality-based selection method and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The selection \nmethod is considered appropriate for this TA because the assignment is a high-impact national \npolicy and sector study, which can be carried out in substantially different ways, and the value of \nthe consulting services depends on the quality of the analysis. ADB\u2019s full technical proposal \napproach will be used to select and engage the consultants. The consultants will procure TA \nequipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement. The consultants\u2019 outline \nterms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  The consultants will submit an inception report within 1 month of commencing the \nservices, an interim report including the two provincial case studies (part A) and the analysis of \npolicy problems (part B) after 5 months, a draft final report including recommendations for \nchange (part C) after 7 months, and a final report after 8 months. All reports will be translated \ninto Chinese. The results of the study will be disseminated in part through a series of seminars, \nworkshops, and training sessions in Beijing and in the case-study provinces. Training may also \ninclude  participating  in  international  and  national  conferences  and  seminars.  An  inception \nworkshop is expected to be held in Beijing, one workshop in one of the two case-study \nprovinces, and one final national workshop. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Spain, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy Study, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.

Identify sectors where such investment will be \nmost crucial to town economic development. Based on an understanding of \nprivate sector investors\u2019 criteria for making decisions, suggest ways that towns \n(and their provincial governments) can become more attractive to investors.  \n \n(vi)  Using the provincial case studies (part A), the results of (i), and other studies and \nreports on urbanization in the PRC, recommend national and provincial policy \nchanges to overcome barriers to town development. The strategy should (a) \nremain  largely  at  the  level  of  policy  instruments  and  identify  and  combine \ninstruments that will have the greatest desired impact on the issues; (b) provide \nan  integrated  approach  to  questions  of  population  distribution,  economic \nefficiency, poverty reduction, land use, delivery of social services, environmental \nprotection, institutional arrangements, and financing capacities; and (c) reflect the \nvarying conditions and trends in different provinces/regions.  \n \n(vii)  Assess the institutional and financial implications of the proposed policy changes \nfor national, provincial, and local governments.
