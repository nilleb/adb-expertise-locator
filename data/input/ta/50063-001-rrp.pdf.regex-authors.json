THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Kashkadarya Regional Road Project.1 \n \n2.  The project aims to upgrade and widen the existing Karshi\u2013Shakhrisabz\u2013Kitab highway \nin Kashkadarya province, with a total length of about 77 kilometers (km).2 A section of the \nproject road is part of Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridor 6a.  \nThe project also includes an institutional capacity development component for the Republican \nRoad Fund (RRF) and national design institutes that aims to advance effective design and \nconstruction standards and support project management.3 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Double landlocked country. Uzbekistan is a double landlocked country located in the \nheart of Central Asia that borders all of the other Central Asian countries, including Afghanistan, \nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Uzbekistan is a lower middle-\nincome, resource-rich country, with a population of about 31.8 million in 2016. The country\u2019s \neconomy  grew  by  8%  in  2015,  its  ninth  consecutive  year  of  expansion  at  8%  or  higher. \nHowever,  growth  is  expected  to  decline  due  to  the  economic  slowdown  in  the  Russian \nFederation, Uzbekistan\u2019s largest trading partner, and slowing economic activity in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \n \n4.  Improved transit corridor. As a key transit country for trade within the region and with \nthe rest of Eurasia, Uzbekistan is a member country of the CAREC program, which aims to \nimprove regional connectivity and cut transport costs.4 CAREC\u2019s action plan envisages six \nCAREC corridors connecting the region\u2019s key economic hubs to each other, and to other \nEurasian  and global  markets. Two  corridors  cross  Uzbekistan,  including  Corridor 2,  which \nconnects the Caucasus and Mediterranean to East Asia; and Corridor 6, which connects Europe \nand  the  Russian  Federation  to  the  Middle  East  and  South  Asia.  The  proposed  road \nimprovements covering a section of CAREC Corridor 6a will improve the corridor\u2019s efficiency. \n \n5.  Adequate scope of the road network. Road transport is the dominant mode of freight \nand  passenger  movements  within  the  country  as  well  as  across  its  international  borders.  \nRoad transport consists of international transit traffic, which accounts for 10% of the volume of \nfreight transport; and domestic passenger and short-haul cargo traffic, which represent around \n88% of road traffic. The total length of Uzbekistan\u2019s road network is 185,000 km, 42,654 km of \nwhich form the core network. The core road network comprises international roads (3,979 km), \nnational roads (14,069 km), and regional roads (24,606 km), all of which fall under the purview \nof the RRF and are maintained by Uzavtoyul Joint Stock Company. Almost all of the roads of \nthe core road network are paved. While Uzbekistan is comparable with other countries in \nCentral Asia in terms of density of paved roads, the distribution of paved roads varies within the \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in: Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, \n2016\u20132018. Manila. \n3  ADB provided a project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the Third CAREC Corridor Road Investment \nProgram (TA 8950-UZB). The project used to be part of the Third CAREC Corridor Road Investment Program and \nADB agreed with the government\u2019s request to process it as a stand-alone project on 13 May 2016.  \n4  ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila. \n ", " \n2\ncountry.5 \n \n6.  Past  achievements.  Uzbekistan  has  developed  a  road  sector  policy  framework  to \nimprove governance, accountability, sustainability, seamless transport logistics, and greater \nprivate participation. Several policy and institutional reforms have been carried out since 2003, \nincluding (i) separating planning and programming of road works from road construction and \nmaintenance; (ii) creating the RRF as a quasi-independent body to mobilize and manage road \nsector  revenues;  (iii)  promoting  competitive  bidding  for  all  road  construction  works;  \n(iv) establishing an external quality control mechanism; (iv) engaging road design engineers \nthrough competitive selection for low class roads; and (v) establishing a state-owned road \nequipment pool company to lease equipment to all contractors.6 The Government of Uzbekistan \nhas also restructured Uzavtoyul7 to be a joint stock company with defined performance and \naccountability targets. Despite recent achievements, the road sector still faces a number of \nchallenges. \n \n7.  Financial sustainability. The RRF is responsible for financing about 25% of the entire \nnetwork. About 85% of the financial resources available to the RRF accrue from the profit and \nturnover tax, which generates substantial revenue. However, the tax is neither equitable nor \ncommensurate with the cost incidence of the different vehicle classes and their impact on road \nconditions and maintenance. The profit and turnover tax is not fully aligned with road use and \nthus does not adequately reflect the costs caused by road users. It is necessary to introduce \ndesignated user charges, which should be identified and levied separately from general taxation \nso that they can be earmarked and allocated for road works. \n \n8.  Need for a systematic maintenance regime. Allocations to the RRF have increased \nfrom about $297.5 million in 2011 to about $747.3 million in 2015, an annual increase of about \n26%.  During  this  period,  RRF  expenditures  also  rose  sharply  by  almost  45%  per  year, \nexceeding revenues for the first time in 2013. In 2015, revenues accounted for only 70% of total \nexpenditures. In 2011, routine and periodic maintenance expenditures accounted for 33% of \ntotal road expenditures; this dropped to 27% in 2015. The average maintenance expenditure \n(both  routine  and  periodic)  is  relatively  low  at  $23,800  per  km.  However,  maintenance \nallocations vary widely, from about $90,000 per km for international roads to $10,000 per km for \nlocal roads. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has helped the RRF develop a road asset \nmanagement system (RAMS).8 Additional support for a condition survey and the preparation of \na road asset inventory will be needed before the RAMS becomes fully functional. Both ADB and \nthe World Bank are currently providing assistance to this end.  \n \n9.  Road sector institutions. Despite the delineation of functions between the RRF and \nUzavtoyul, some overlaps continue to exist. Neither Uzavtoyul nor the RRF is currently a  \nfull-fledged road authority, although both display some characteristics thereof. The RRF, as a \nfinancier, might focus on managing the collection and expenditure of the revenues, such as \n                                                 \n5  The density is higher in the eastern regions (4,000 km\u20136,000 km per 10,000 km2 in Andijan, Ferghana, Namangan, \nand Tashkent). To the south, the density decreases to moderate values (1,000 km\u20133,000 km per 10,000 km2),  \nand is lowest in the western regions (less than 1,000 km per 10,000 km2 in Karakalpakstan and Novoi). \n6  A subcomponent of ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed \nLoan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the CAREC Regional Road Project. Manila (Loan 2403-UZB). \n7  Uzavtoyul was restructured into a joint stock company in 2003. Highway maintenance was separated from the rest \n \nof the network, and seven specialized highway maintenance enterprises were established under Uzavtoyul.\n8  The development of a RAMS was supported by ADB. 2007.

Although some of \nUzavtoyul\u2019s technical expertise migrated to the RRF when the RRF was shifted to the Treasury, \nUzavtoyul remains the premier road agency in terms of technical skills. The dilution of this skill \nbase, combined with the creation of a parallel organization, diminishes road sector efficiency. \nUzavtoyul, supported by ADB, is currently divesting some of its construction subsidiaries so that \nthey become legally and financially autonomous commercial entities. After having attained this \nstatus, they will be eligible to participate in the bidding for ADB-financed projects. \n \n10.  Road design and construction standards. The design and construction standards \ncurrently in use were developed in the 1980s and have been updated periodically, but without \nchanging their essential features.9 Some provisions for road geometric and pavement design \nare excessive, resulting in unnecessarily high construction and maintenance costs. Road safety \nconsiderations are not adequately incorporated in the design standards. The standards should \nbe reviewed and modernized in line with the latest technology and international best practices. \n \n11.  Road safety. Road safety is a growing concern in Uzbekistan as the rapid growth in \nnumbers of motorized vehicles has led to a dramatic increase in road accidents. Road accidents \nhave  become  a  leading  cause  of  death,  especially  among  men.  On  average,  \n2  fatalities  occur  for  every  10  accidents.  Uzbekistan  records  1,430  fatalities  per  1  million \nvehicles,  which  is  high  by  international  standards.10  Poor  road  conditions  and  traffic  rule \nviolations, particularly of speed limits, are major causes of the high fatality rate. \n \n12.  ADB  sector  work.  ADB  has  been  Uzbekistan's  lead  development  partner  in  the \ntransport sector since 1998. From 2005 to 2015, ADB approved seven loans for road projects \ntotaling $983 million, of which two loans  were successfully completed, and five are being \nimplemented under two CAREC Corridor 2 road investment programs. The government has \nasked ADB to continue to support the rehabilitation of CAREC Corridors 2 and 6. The project \nresponds to this request. \n \n13.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous and ongoing road \nprojects. Key lessons are that (i) road engineering and designs should be consistent with \ninternationally recognized design and construction standards, (ii) a strong project management \nunit (PMU) is indispensable for successful project implementation and should be in place as \nearly as possible in the planning stage of the project, and (iii) the PMU and RRF should \nenhance  their  capacity  and  streamline  approval  procedures  to  facilitate  procurement  and \ncontract management. \n \n14.  The project area. The project will complement ongoing efforts to improve the CAREC \ncorridors by improving the road linking the tourist centers of Karshi, Shakhrisabz, and Kitab in \nthe Kashkadarya Province. This road connects Karshi to Samarkand in the north, another \nfamous tourism destination in the country. The current condition of the project road is poor.  \nIts pavement has deteriorated, the drainage system has fallen into disrepair, and several of its \njunctions  are  prone  to  accidents.  The  Kashkadarya  province  has  become  an  attractive \ndestination for national and international tourists, with the number of tourists increasing by 37%, \nfrom 24,100 in 2012 to 33,200 in 2015. The project will improve regional connectivity and \ntransport efficiency, and create more job opportunities. In addition to civil works, the project will \n                                                 \n9  These design standards date back to the road system of the former Soviet Union, which had a single network \ngoverned by the same set of administrative rules, regulations, and technical standards. Accordingly, a single \ndesign methodology, as well as identical road construction and maintenance practices, were followed in all of the \nformer Soviet Union\u2019s constituent republics. The Soviet Union State All-Union Standard, a road design and \nconstruction standard, is still being applied in Uzbekistan. \n10 The corresponding figures for Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore are below 200. \n ", " \n4\nfinance  implementation  support  and  capacity  development  by  improving  design  and \nconstruction standards and by providing project management training for the national design \ninstitutes and RRF. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 action \nplan, as well as with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016.11 \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n15.  The  impacts  will  be  increased  international  trade  and  tourism  along  the  CAREC \ncorridors,  safer  roads,  and  economical  and  efficient  road  planning  and  construction.  \nThe outcome will be improved efficiency of Uzbekistan\u2019s road sector. \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  The project outputs will be:  \n \n(i)  Upgrading of approximately 77 kilometers of highway in the Kashkadarya \nprovince. The project will upgrade two road sections, approximately 77 km in \nlength, of the existing highway in the Kashkadarya province between Karshi, \nShakhrisabz, and Kitab cities into a 4-lane concrete pavement incorporating road \nsafety and climate change adaptation features.  \n(ii)  Capacity of the RRF and national design institutes strengthened. The project \nwill develop the capacity of the RRF and selected national road design institutes \nin relation to modern road design and construction standards, and support the \nproject management. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The RRF will be the executing agency in charge of project implementation. The RRF has \nestablished a PMU and appointed key staff to implement the project on a day-to-day basis. \nSpecifically,  the  PMU  will  (i)  conduct  procurement  and  contract  management;  (ii)  provide \nfinancial  management;  and  (iii)  undertake  progress  evaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  \nThe construction supervision consultants will be engaged as the engineer for the construction \ncontract. An institutional development consulting firm will be recruited to help update the design \nand construction standards. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).12 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2017\u2013December 2021 \n \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021\nLoan closing date  30 June 2022 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Interministerial project steering committee, consisting of members from the \nMinistry of Economy; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Foreign Economic \nRelations, Investments and Trade; and Ministry of Justice, as well as other \nrelevant line ministries, chaired by the first deputy prime minister. \n(ii)  Executing agency  Republican Road Fund, Ministry of Finance \n(iii) Implementation unit  Project management unit, Tashkent \nProcurement  Procurement of ADB-financed goods, civil works, and related services will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime).  \nInternational  2 civil works contracts  $176 million \ncompetitive bidding \n  Shopping  1 contract  $34,000 \nConsulting services  The consultant recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nQuality- and cost- 1 contract for construction  $3.5 million \nbased selection  supervision consultant   \n(90:10)  (502 person-months)   \n                                                 \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " \n6\nAspects  Arrangements \n1 contract for institutional  $0.5 million \ndevelopment consultant \nLeast-cost selection  1 contract for financial auditor  $0.1 million \nIndividual  1 contract for environment  $0.2 million \nconsultants  specialist (50 person-months) \nAdvance contracting  Civil works and consulting services  \nRetroactive financing  Civil works, consulting services, and eligible incremental administrative \ncosts, incurred up to 12 months before the signing of the loan, subject to \nthe ceiling of 20% of the loan amount \nDisbursement  The proceeds of the ADB loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the Government of Uzbekistan and \nADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The project involves the rehabilitation of a road running over mostly flat and hilly terrain \nand, therefore, does not pose a particular technical challenge. An improved drainage system will \nmitigate climate change impacts, which is not expected to be significant. A national design \nconsultant  (Yo\u2019l  Loyiha  Byurosi)  completed  the  design,  which  an  international  consultant \nreviewed, making it possible to optimize most of the design features. In addition, a road safety \naudit carried out in accordance with international standards will make the road design safer. \nSpecifically, the project will focus on improving road safety by widening the carriageway to four \nlanes (six lanes in towns), reconstructing overpasses, widening or replacing bridges, installing \nroad  furniture  and  safety  facilities,  constructing  new  enclosed  bus  stops,  and  restoring \ndrainages. The project will follow the existing alignment, except for sections where very minor \nrealignments are needed to improve sight distance and safety. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The economic and financial analysis concluded that the project is economically viable. \nThe project is expected to generate economic benefits mainly through vehicle operating cost \nand travel time savings, as well as improved road safety due to the specific road safety features \nincorporated in the design. Together, these benefits will yield an economic internal rate of return \nof 14.9%, and will accrue, not only to current road users, but also to those who divert from the \nlonger connection through Guzar. Sensitivity tests and calculations of switching values were \ncarried out to determine the effect of variations in key project parameters. The result shows \nswitching values of 71% with respect to construction costs and \u201343% with respect to benefits, \nmeaning that the project would remain economically efficient if construction costs rose by 71% \nor if benefits fell by 43% from the base case values.13 Project viability would remain robust if no \ntraffic diverts or accident cost savings materialize. \n \n22.  As there are no plans to collect tolls on the project road, the project will not generate \nfinancial  revenues.  Thus,  no  financial  analysis  was  undertaken.  However,  the  project  is \nexpected  to  free  up  government  financial  resources,  as  the  designed  concrete  pavement \nsurface will considerably reduce periodic and routine maintenance requirements. Precautionary \nmeasures will be taken to ensure that an adequate budget is allocated to road maintenance in \n                                                 \n13 Switching value is the percentage change of an independent variable chosen to make the economic internal rate of \nreturn fall to a defined hurdle rate and the net present value to become zero. ADB has set the hurdle rate at 12%. \n ", " \n7\ngeneral and the project in particular. \n  \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial management. A financial management assessment of the RRF confirmed \nthat  it  has  adequate  capacity  to  manage  and  maintain  the  required  accounting  systems, \nfinancial controls, and audit arrangements. Nonetheless, the risk was rated substantial due to \nthe  RRF\u2019s  accounting  method.  However,  this  shortcoming  will  be  mitigated  by  the \nprofessionalism and competence of the staff that the RRF has assigned to the PMU. Most PMU \nstaff  are  experienced  in  financial  management  and  procurement,  and  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \npolicies and reporting requirements, especially with respect to financial statements and progress \nmonitoring reports. In addition, training workshops will be conducted to ensure that any new \nstaff are trained in good governance practices, especially relating to financial management and \nprocurement. \n \n24.  Procurement A procurement risk assessment of the RRF indicated that the project \nprocurement  risk  is  high  considering  past  procurement  performances,  especially  under  \nADB-financed projects, and the public procurement environment in Uzbekistan. The government \nhas an established governance mechanism and practiced  in procurement decision-making and \noversight. Nonetheless project-specific adjustments will be made to improve their effectiveness. \nWhile the PMU has the capacity to undertake certain procurement functions according to ADB\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures,  some  tender  committee  members  tasked  to  review  and  approve \nprocurement  transactions  lack  the  required  capacity  and  experience  in  following  these \nprocedures. \n \n25.  The  main  procurement  management  challenges  for  the  RRF  are  (i)  the  lack  of  a  \nwell-established  permanent  procurement  unit  handling  procurement  under  foreign-funded \nprojects; (ii) multiple layers of review and approving authorities, including several committees \nresponsible  for  procurement  approval,  such  as  the  interministerial  tender  committee,  \nworking-level tender committee, and evaluation committees, with weak coordination among \nvarious  department  stakeholders;  (iii)  complex  and  lengthy  bureaucratic  systems  causing \nproject procurement and implementation delays; and (iv) the engagement of some procurement \nstaff on contractual employment, resulting in unsustainable capacity building. \n \n26.  To mitigate these risks, the following measures are being taken: (i) improve the project \ngovernance mechanism by restructuring the procurement decision-making process and their \nroles and responsibilities of each stakeholders; (ii) improve the knowledge and capacity of all \nunits and committees involved in project procurement transactions through a short briefing  \n(for high-level committee members) and in-depth practical seminars (for lower level committee \nmembers  and  PMU  staff)  on  ADB  procurement  procedures;  and  (iii)  initiate  advance \nprocurement for civil works contracts with support from the consultant(s) to minimize delays. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s  Integrity  Principles  and  Guidelines14  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  \nas  amended  to  date)  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  RRF.  \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 12). \n \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2015. Integrity Principles and Guidelines. Manila. \n ", " \n8\nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n28.  The assessment of social impacts and analysis of key stakeholders\u2019 perceptions and \nconcerns about the project have been conducted, with positive feedback. A socioeconomic \nsurvey carried out along the project road indicated an average household size of five persons. \nMen and women constitute nearly equal portions of the affected population, with 51% of men \nand  49%  of  women  found  to  be  educated.  Apart  from  business  (small  businesses  and \nenterprises) and government employment, agriculture is a key source of income for the affected \nhouseholds.  Most  households  in  the  project  area  have  access  to  basic  social  services.  \nAccess will become easier once road conditions are improved. Although the project is classified \nno  gender  elements,  women  will  form  a  major  group  of  direct  project  beneficiaries.  \nBenefits expected to accrue primarily to women include better access to basic economic and \nsocial services. Women in rural Uzbekistan are responsible for key family activities such as \nthose relating to child education, childcare, health, and food. The transport burden faced by \nwomen impedes their ability to build their assets and reduce their vulnerability. In general, \nreducing  the  burden  of  transport  will  increase  women\u2019s  productivity  and  income.  \nHighway construction and the development of long-term transit routes may increase the risk of \nsexually transmitted infections. The government is taking this risk seriously and has agreed \nupon a mitigation plan with ADB. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is \nclassified  category  B  for  the  environment.  Likely  adverse  impacts  will  be  limited  to  the \nconstruction stage. Such impacts may include (i) noise, dust, vehicle emissions, and vibration \naffecting settlements along the project road; (ii) impacts on rivers due to bridge rehabilitation \nand  construction  works;  (iii)  impacts  due  to  material  transportation  from  borrow  sites;  \n(iv) impacts of tree cutting along the project road to clear rights-of-way; (v) impacts from asphalt \nand concrete mixing plants and aggregate crushers; and (vi) impacts from the contractor's \nworking camps. Impacts during the operation stage include noise and vibration due to the \nincrease in traffic volume. Noise and vibration modeling has been conducted for sensitive \nreceptors in both construction and operation stages. The environmental management plan \n(EMP) prepared as part of the initial environmental examination includes mitigation measures. \nThe initial environmental examination was disclosed on the ADB website on 31 August 2016. \n \n30.  The PMU and RRF will be responsible for implementing the EMP. A qualified, full-time \nsafeguard  professional  designated  together  with  the  supervision  consultant\u2019s  environment \nspecialists will help to oversee the EMP\u2019s implementation. The project will finance the cost of \nimplementing the EMP. The civil works contracts will include the cost of mitigation measures \nand  environmental  monitoring.  The  construction  supervision  consultant\u2019s  consulting  service \ncontract will include the cost of environmental supervision. A grievance redress mechanism to \nhandle both environmental and social safeguard issues will be established. The PMU will submit \nsemiannual environmental monitoring reports for the ADB-financed section to ADB and relevant \ngovernment authorities; these reports will be disclosed to the public on the RRF (in Uzbek or \nRussian) and ADB (in English) websites. \n \n31.  Resettlement. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement. Land \nacquisition was initiated in 2014, before ADB considered supporting the project. In April 2016, \nthe RRF informed ADB that all land acquisition had been completed; on 13 May 2016, the \ngovernment requested ADB to process the project as a stand-alone project; and in June 2016, \nADB proceeded to conduct a resettlement due diligence study, including to determine any gaps \nwhen compared with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. A social due diligence report was \n ", " \n9\nprepared, endorsed by the RRF, and disclosed to the public on 6 September 2016.15 \n \n32.  The due diligence study established that land acquisition was initiated in 2014 by \ninvoking  the  requirements  of  the  Land  Code  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan,  1998.  \nLand  acquisition  followed  the  country\u2019s  land  legislation,  which  requires  land  for  land \nreplacement and full compensation at market price (including transaction costs) for housing and \nother land developments before taking possession of the assets. Affected households are paid \nthe first 50% of their compensation while the land acquisition is still in progress, and the \nremaining 50% is paid after the demolition of the housing structures. Physically displaced \npersons are given rental assistance for 2 years, as well as shifting assistance to enable them to \nbuild replacement housing within this time frame. Affected households are given 6 months\u2019 \nadvance notice delivered to them personally by a khokimiyat (district administration) official, in \nkeeping  with  information  disclosure  and  consultation  regulations.  The  country  has  an \nestablished  grievance  redress  mechanism  based  on  the  national  law.  Based  on  the  due \ndiligence study, all affected households have received the first 50% of their compensation. \nPayment of the remaining 50% is ongoing. \n \n33.  To  ensure  the  payment  of  full  compensation  to  all  affected  households,  \na corrective action plan was prepared and included in the social due diligence report (DDR).   \nAll affected households shall receive compensation in full before any construction commences. \nThis is also a covenant in the loan agreement.  \n \n34.  ADB will monitor and review compliance against the DDR and periodically update the \nsame. To cover any unanticipated impacts, a resettlement framework has also been prepared. \nThe resettlement framework includes an entitlement matrix (for the unanticipated impacts) and a \nrequirement to prepare the appropriate resettlement plan. The resettlement framework was \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 6 September 2016.16 \n \n35.  Indigenous people. The country does not have communities inhabited by indigenous \npeople  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  operational  purposes.  \nAs such, the project is classified category C for indigenous peoples, and requires no further \naction. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 The project procurement is classified \ncategory  B.  Overall,  the  risks  are  deemed  manageable  by  adopting  adequate  mitigating \nmeasures, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of \nmitigation. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nAllocation of funds to maintain  ADB will help strengthen the RRF\u2019s capacity to increase the \nproject road and facilities is  budget allocation and improve program budgeting in the road \ninadequate.  sector through continuous policy dialogues.

ASSURANCES \n37.  The government and RRF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and RRF have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.
