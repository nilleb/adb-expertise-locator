Recognizing the importance of procurement, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nother development partners have helped its developing member countries (DMCs) improve their \npublic  procurement  systems  since  the  1990s.  However,  continuing  delays  in  project \nimplementation caused by slow procurement and weak governance structures remain a major \nimpediment to effective project implementation and utilization of funds.  \n \n2.  ADB is strengthening its efforts to improve institutional capacity in its DMCs and mitigate \nprocurement and fiduciary risk within the framework of government-owned programs.1 Through \nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, Accra Agenda for Action, and Busan Partnership \nAgreement,  ADB  has  committed  to  rely  increasingly  on  country  systems  and  to  support \nprocurement capacities in its DMCs. However, such broader efforts need to be complemented \nby more direct support to the DMC agencies responsible for procurement of ADB-financed \nprojects. The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will facilitate \nprocurement in selected DMCs, working closely with executing and implementing agencies in \nimproving  procurement  quality  and  efficiency.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Experience from ADB-financed projects across DMCs shows that procurement takes a \nconsiderable amount of time and often delays project implementation. Common causes of \nprocurement delays are (i) insufficient implementation capacity, especially in procurement and \nproject management; (ii) unfamiliarity with ADB procurement processes and procedures; (iii) \nweak governance systems; and (iv) insufficient monitoring and reporting on the progress of \nprocurement.  \n \n4.  Although several DMCs have implemented procurement reforms, translating these into \nchanges in procurement practices, improvements in procurement outcomes, and better project \nimplementation remains a huge task. Good organizational practice includes setting specific \ntargets on the performance of the executing or implementing agency\u2019s procurement portfolio, \nand continually monitoring and reporting on the progress and results being achieved. This \nstrategic approach to managing procurement is difficult to adopt without capacity and support, \nas well as the right capabilities of and incentives for procurement staff.  \n \n5.  ADB  carries  out  procurement  capacity  assessments  of  executing  or  implementing \nagencies during project processing to detect risks based on international best practices. ADB \nadopts  suitable  risk-mitigation  measures  during  project  implementation.  However,  the \nunderlying  causes  of  weak  procurement  and  implementation  capacity\u2014whether  they  are \ninherent in the executing agency or implementing agency or in the environment where the \nagencies  operate\u2014are  not  necessarily  dealt  with  during  project  processing  and  project \nimplementation. This contributes to significant delays during project implementation.   \n \n6.  The TA will take a new direct approach that supports executing agencies, implementing \nagencies, and other key participants in procurement in the key sectors of ADB assistance. The \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Developing Procurement Capacity for Improved Procurement Outcomes. \nManila; ADB. 2012.

The  TA  will  help  facilitate  procurement  by  executing  agencies  and  implementing \nagencies by providing hands-on support and direct assistance in key stages of the procurement \nprocess. This direct approach, which will complement other broader efforts, is expected to help \nimprove quality and reduce delays in procurement that lead to project implementation delays. \n \n7.  The executing agencies and implementing agencies will be determined in consultation \nwith DMC governments and national public procurement authorities. A partnership approach \nwith the executing agencies and implementing agencies will be implemented to improve their \nprocurement operations. The lessons learned and results achieved will be shared with and \nreplicated in other executing and implementing agencies.  \n \n8.  The  TA  will  be  demand-driven  to  ensure  ownership  by  and  commitment  from  the \nexecuting agencies and implementing agencies. ADB will maintain a procurement monitoring \nsystem  that  will  closely  track  procurement  timelines  and  results  in  each  country  receiving \nsupport. Existing country systems will be utilized where feasible. \n \n9.  The  TA  will  complement  other  TA  projects  in  supporting  improved  project \nimplementation (footnote 1). This TA will not duplicate ongoing assistance which addresses \nportfolio management in general. This TA will provide direct support in improving procurement \nprocesses in selected DMCs and strengthening project management capacity of executing \nagencies and implementing agencies of specific ADB-funded projects. \n \n10.  Furthermore, the TA builds on ADB\u2019s experience in supporting national procurement \ncapacity  development,  including  the  ongoing  TA  projects  administered  by  the  Operations \nServices  and  Financial  Management  Department  in  various  DMCs  (footnote  1).  Such  TA \nsupport  has  targeted  national  policy,  national  e-procurement  systems,  regional  dialogue, \nknowledge sharing, and effective contract project management. A common finding from past TA \nprojects is the lack of procurement metrics, which this TA will address. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the proposed TA will be enhanced operational effectiveness of ADB \nprojects in South Asia. \n \n12.  The outcome will be improved efficiency and quality of procurement of ADB projects in \nSouth  Asia.  The  TA  will  improve  processes  and  provide  advice  that  will  result  in  faster \nprocurement approvals in ADB projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.   The TA will have two outputs: (i) improved procurement processes, and (ii) strengthened \nprocurement and project management capacity. \n \n14.  Output  1:  Improved  procurement  processes.  The  TA  will  improve  procurement \nresults  by  providing  hands-on  support  to  selected  executing  agencies  and  implementing \nagencies during key stages of their procurement. The TA consultants will identify procurement \nproblems  and  develop  practical  solutions.  On-the-ground  support  will  be  provided  to \n ", "  3 \nparticipating executing agencies and implementing agencies in their procurement processes \nand key procurement actions to facilitate efficient and transparent procurement. The TA will \nsupport these agencies in closely tracking their procurement processes and key procurement \nactions, promoting greater efficiency and timeliness in procurement. The TA will support the \napplication of best project management practices to improve project implementation, focusing \non procurement processes and procurement actions.    \n \n15.  Output  2:  Strengthened  procurement  and  project  management  capacity. \nProcurement clinics, project management clinics, and on-the-job training will be conducted in \nresponse to demand from the staff of executing agencies, implementing agencies, and other \nkey participants involved in procurement and implementation of projects. The training will focus \non  critical  needs  and  identified  problems,  leveraging  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  project \nimplementation  and  procurement (para.  9). It will  draw  upon  completed  ADB  procurement \ncapacity assessments. A program for training of trainers will also be developed. A tool for \nmonitoring and reporting on the progress of procurement will be established, using existing \nplatforms, systems, and practices. Good practices and lessons in procurement and project \nmanagement will be documented, shared, and replicated.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Detailed cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA is expected to start in January 2014 and be completed by December 2016. ADB \nwill be the executing agency responsible for the coordination, supervision, and implementation \nof all TA activities. SARD will manage and oversee TA implementation, working closely with \nexecuting and implementing agencies in South Asia DMCs. SARD will implement the proposed \nactivities  in  close  coordination  with  staff  from  the  Operations  Services  and  Financial \nManagement  Department.  Staff  in  resident  missions  will  coordinate  day-to-day  TA \nimplementation, ensuring effective use of TA consultants. Disbursements under the TA will be \ndone  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time).   \n \n18.  The TA will require about 27 person-months of international consultants and about 40 \nperson-months of national consultants with skills in procurement, project management, and \ncapacity development. The outline terms of reference is in Appendix 3. ADB will recruit the \nconsultants as individuals. Recruitment will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  A review of the TA will be undertaken after 6 months of implementation to assess \nprogress,  fine-tune  outputs,  and,  if  necessary,  make  adjustments  to  key  activities  and \nimplementation arrangements. A full assessment will be undertaken upon TA completion to \nreport on the achievements and results in procurement, and to share the lessons learned.    \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "4   \nIV.
