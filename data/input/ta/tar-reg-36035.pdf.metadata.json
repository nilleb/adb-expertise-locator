INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  December  2001  at  the  seventh  meeting  of  the  Experts  Group  on  Power \nInterconnection and Trade (EGP), the countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS),1 all of \nwhich are members of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), requested ADB to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare a regional power trade operating agreement (PTOA) in the GMS. \nThe goals, purpose, scope, outline terms of reference, and implementation arrangement for the \nTA were discussed and endorsed at the eighth meeting of the EGP on 10 October 2002 and at \nthe ninth meeting of the Subregional Electric Power Forum (EPF) on 11 October 2002. Also, the \n11th GMS Ministerial Conference in September 2002 endorsed the discussions of the eighth \nmeeting of EGP. The TA has been included in ADB\u2019s 2002 GMS Subregional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program.2 \n \n2.  The PTOA will contain rules and guidelines for technical coordination among GMS \nmembers and cross-border transmission pricing schemes, and specify the required institutional \nframework to advance power trade in the subregion under the Inter-Governmental Agreement \non Regional Power Trade in the GMS (IGA). The IGA was initialed by all six GMS members at \nthe 11th GMS Ministerial Conference on 23 September 2002 and subsequently signed by all six \nGMS members at the first GMS summit meeting on 3 November 2002. The TA framework is \nshown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB has played a leading role in GMS cooperation in the electric power sector, as a part \nof the program for economic cooperation in the GMS that ADB initiated in 1992. The EPF and \nEGP meetings under the GMS activities have been held with ADB\u2019s assistance to enhance \nsubregional cooperation in the electric power sector. The main objectives of the EPF are to \n(i) promote  opportunities  for  extended  economic  cooperation  in  the  electric  power  sector; \n(ii) facilitate implementation of priority subregional power projects; and (iii) address technical, \neconomic, financial, and institutional issues relevant to subregional power sector development. \nThe EGP was created in June 1998 to discuss detailed work programs and recommend its \nfindings to the EPF to (i) promote development of a subregional transmission network, and \n(ii) facilitate the expansion of cross-border power trade. \n \n4.  In the GMS, power has been traded on a bilateral basis, mainly through either the \nmemorandum  of  understanding  between  the  governments  or  long-term  power  purchase \nagreements. Such bilateral trade will bring about some benefits. But the full potential will not be \nrealized unless regional power transmission networks is formed, i.e., until the power grid is \ndeveloped and operated in a coordinated manner by an operating agreement on power trade \ntoward a competitive subregional electricity market in the GMS. \n \n5.  Subregional electricity trade based on interconnected electric power networks under the \nIGA will provide significant economic and environmental benefits for individual countries and the \nentire subregion. Such trade will enable members to (i) reduce national investments in the \npower  reserves  maintained  to  meet  peak  demand;  (ii)  provide  a  more  reliable  supply  of \nelectricity, including power supply from an interconnected network in case of a power failure; \n(iii) reduce operational costs; (iv) reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants; and \n                                                 \n1  The GMS consists of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan \nProvince of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 February 2002. ", "2 \n(v) increase consumers\u2019 access to the cheapest and most environmentally friendly sustainable \nsource of electricity in the subregion. \n \n6.  As a part of the energy sector cooperation program and in order to provide the policy \nframework for promoting opportunities for extended economic cooperation on regional power \ntrade and facilitating the implementation of priority power projects in the GMS, the Policy \nStatement  on  Regional  Power  Trade  in  the  GMS  was  endorsed  in  January  2000  by  all \nmembers. Since 2001, the draft IGA has been reviewed and discussed among members at \nrelevant GMS energy meetings to realize the member\u2019s commitment for power trade; and the \nIGA was signed by all six members at the first GMS summit meeting.  \n \n7.  The IGA is the first outcome of the highest commitment by all members to promote \nregional power trade and toward a competitive electricity market in the GMS. Through the IGA, \nall members are enable to (i) coordinate and cooperate in the planning and operation of their \nsystems to minimize costs while maintaining satisfactory reliability, (ii) fully recover their costs \nand share equitably in the resulting benefits, and (iii) provide reliable and economical electricity \nservice to the customers of each country. The IGA also provides for the creation of a high-level \nbody, the Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee (RPTCC), to actively coordinate the \nimplementation of regional power trade.  \n \n8.  In  accordance  with  the  IGA,  the  guidelines  for  the  establishment  of  RPTCC  were \ndiscussed  and  adopted  at  the  eighth  EGP  meeting  on  10  October  2002.  The  guidelines \nspecified  the  objectives,  function,  representation,  coordinators,  chairperson,  PTOA  project \nmanager, and working groups. The main functions of the RPTCC are to (i) provide policy \nguidance for the working groups during the study of options for the structure of the future GMS \npower market and recommend to the ministerial level the appropriate market structure and likely \nphases of its development; and (ii) provide GMS members with a final draft of the PTOA that will \nspecify the operating rules and guidelines for regional power trade. The PTOA is a vital and \nintegral component of the GMS flagship program, which was endorsed by the GMS summit \nmeeting. The PTOA will provide harmonized rules of technical coordination and agreed cross-\nborder transmission tariff schemes, and will have an important role in providing the policy \nenvironment needed to attract the private sector to physical investments. \n \n9.  Besides preparation of the policy framework for promoting  regional power trade, the \nregional indicative master plan on power interconnection in the GMS3 was developed starting in \nOctober  2000  with  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  order  to  identify  necessary  physical  power \ninterconnections in the subregion up to 2020. The indicative master plan was endorsed in May \n2002  by  the  seventh  meeting  of  the  EGP.  Among  identified  power  transmission \ninterconnections, the interconnection between Cambodia and Viet Nam is programmed for \n2003, and the interconnection among Thailand, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet \nNam is programmed for 2006. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The main objectives of the study are to help GMS members prepare a regional power \ntrade operating agreement, taking into account the IGA and desirable forms of power trade in \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000.

Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The activities of the study include (i) consolidating and reviewing the existing studies and \nagreements; (ii) reviewing similar operating agreements in other power markets; (iii) developing \ndesirable forms of power trade, taking into account the study for options for the structure of \npower market in the GMS; (iv) recommending the rules and guidelines of technical coordination; \n(v)  preparing  cross-border  transmission  pricing  schemes;  (vi) recommending  necessary \ninstitutional framework; (vii) drafting the PTOA; (viii) finalizing the PTOA through facilitation of \nreview  and  negotiations  among  GMS  members  at  relevant  GMS  energy  meetings;  and \n(ix) Identifying training needs and initial basic infrastructure.  \n \n12.  The consulting services will be carried out over 29 months. The consultants will actively \nparticipate in preparing the study for options for the structure of power market in the GMS, \nwhich commenced in October 2002 with World Bank assistance to identify desirable forms of \npower trade in the GMS. This  will be followed by assessment of technical coordination and \ncross-border transmission arrangement among GMS members. After drafting the PTOA, the \nconsultants will facilitate the review of the draft PTOA and negotiations for its adoption by GMS \nmembers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $920,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $850,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The participating GMS countries will \nprovide the remaining $70,000 equivalent in kind. Details of the cost estimates and financing \nplan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Executing Agency for the study will be ADB. A steering committee, comprising the \nRPTCC and representatives from ADB and World Bank, will be set up for providing overall \nguidance for the study. Each GMS government will (i) appoint three representatives, including a \ncoordinator, for the RPTCC; (ii) appoint a team of counterpart staff to assist the consultants in \npreparing and collecting data and attending working group meetings; and (iii) help organize the \nmeetings as necessary. To help implementation, a PTOA project manager, who will serve as a \nvice-chairperson of the RPTCC, will be appointed among coordinators at the RPTCC meeting, \nin accordance with guidelines for establishment of the RPTCC. GMS members agreed that the \nEPF will be the interim RPTCC until the RPTCC is formally set up after the IGA enters into \nforce.4 In view of the PTOA\u2019s very wide scope, an advisory panel will be set up. The panel will \nconsist of three experts with expertise in regional power trade and preparation of the power \noperating agreement from legal, technical, and commercial aspects. One panel member will \ncome from the private sector. The advisory panel will review the consultants\u2019 reports and attend \nthe steering committee meetings. \n  \n15.  The TA will be carried out by a team of international consultants to be engaged through \na firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A simplified technical \n                                                 \n4  The IGA will enter into force upon the date of issuance of the third certified instruments of ratification or \nacceptance. ", "4 \nproposal format will be used. The TA will require about 18 person-months of international \nconsulting services. A team of experts will be engaged from a firm, with expertise in preparing \npower  trade  operating  agreements  between  utilities  and/or  countries,  including  technical \ncoordination, transmission tariff, and institutional frameworks. The outline terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The consultants will (i) submit an inception report within 1 month of the commencement \nof the TA; (ii) an interim report within 8 months of the commencement; and (iii) a draft final \nreport within 14 months. These reports will be presented at working groups and/or RPTCC \nmeetings. The first draft of PTOA will be prepared by 14 months from the TA\u2019s commencement. \nIt will be discussed in the workshops at each country, followed by review and negotiations \namong GMS members at relevant GMS energy meetings. The TA will start in August 2003 and \nbe completed by December 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.
