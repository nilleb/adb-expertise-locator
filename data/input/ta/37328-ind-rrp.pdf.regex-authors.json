Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \nsupport  implementation  of  the  civil  works.  Road  improvement \nworks  under  the  Project  include  rehabilitating  and  improving \nexisting roads, strengthening existing culverts and bridges, and \nconstructing new bridges and cross-drainage structures.   \n \nThe Project will also enhance overall sector management capacity \nby providing (i) equipment for the government of Madhya Pradesh \n(GOMP)  to  enhance  sector  capacity  such  as  road  safety  and \ncontrol of overloading; and (ii) technical assistance (TA) to support \nGOMP sector development initiatives, especially for reform and \ncapacity  building  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Public  Works \nDepartment (MPPWD), including (a) enhancing planning capacity, \n(b) improving business processes, (c) improving human resources \nmanagement, and (d) increasing private sector participation. \n   \nRationale  The  state  road  network  requires  improvement  in  terms  of \ncoverage  and  conditions.  About  half  of  the  state  roads  are \nassessed  to  have  deteriorated  severely  and  require  major \nrehabilitation  largely  because  of  the  continuous  shortfall  in \ninvestment  on  road  maintenance until  recently,  and  increasing \nvolume of traffic and loads. The rehabilitation of 1,800 km of state \nroads  under  the  Project  will  help  complete  the  strategically \nimportant  state  road  network  and  help  meet  the  increased \ndemands of road transport. \n   ", "ii   \n  MPPWD  is  in  charge  of  overall  sector  development  and \nmanagement. However, it lacks modern project management and \nprocurement systems, which often leads to cost and time overruns \nin  project  delivery.  For  efficient  and  effective  road  asset \ndevelopment and management covering all categories of roads, \nthe overall capacity of MPPWD must be enhanced. The Madhya \nPradesh  Road  Development  Corporation  (MPRDC)  was \nestablished  in  line  with  a  comprehensive  reform  under  the \nMadhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Development Program to \nefficiently implement projects of strategically important state roads \nby  adopting  modern  systems  in  its  business  processes. \nImprovements to road safety and control of overloading are also \nrequired for the safe and efficient use of road assets. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  improve  transport  efficiency  of  the  state  road \nnetwork,  which  will  contribute  to  expansion  of  economic \nopportunities and poverty reduction. This will be realized by (i) \nimproving  the  state  road  network,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  and \nappropriate  road  usage,  (iii)  increasing  efficiency  of  transport \nservices,  and  (iv)  enhancing  GOMP  capacity  for  road  asset \ndevelopment  and  management.  Improved  roads  will  improve \naccessibility  to  social  services  and  markets,  and  enhance  the \nefficiency of road transport usage. With the central location of the \nstate in the country, the Project will improve transport efficiency \nfor the rest of India. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $400 million, \nincluding taxes and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $320,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will provide the loan proceeds in local currency \nTerms  to GOMP on the same terms and conditions as received from \nADB. GOMP will bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  GOMP acting through MPRDC \n   \n ", "    iii     \nImplementation  The chief engineer at MPRDC headquarters will be designated as \nArrangements  the \u201cproject in charge\u201d for project implementation. Seven project \nimplementation units, each headed by a divisional manager, will \nbe responsible for project implementation in the field. One or two \nfull-time  project  managers  will  be  assigned  for  each  contract \npackage.  The  divisional  managers  will  be  delegated  adequate \ntechnical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious  project \nimplementation. Construction supervision consultants engaged by \nMPRDC will act as the engineer for construction contracts. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time \nto time) and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB. The civil works contracts will be procured under international \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  Project  will  provide  $1  million  for \nequipment  to  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures if the estimated contract is valued from $0.1 million to \n$1 million, and shopping if the estimated contract amount is less \nthan $0.1 million.   \n   \nConsulting Services  Two international consulting firms will be recruited for construction \nsupervision of civil works under the Project. MPRDC will select \nand engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). \nAbout 56 person-months of international consultants and 1,758 \nperson-months of national consultants will be required. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The improved state road network management through the sector \nBeneficiaries  development program and the TA, and improved road network \nunder  the  Project  will  enhance  the  overall  road  condition  and \nusability, thus increasing travel speeds and reducing travel time, \naccidents,  and  overloading.  The  Project  will  also  enhance \nMPPWD\u2019s capacity for road asset development and management, \nwhich  will  improve  governance  in  road  administration  and \naccountability,  and  create  an  environment  that  encourages \ncompetition and efficiency within MPPWD and in the construction \nindustry. This will ensure more efficient road asset development \nand  management,  and  higher  quality  of  construction  and \nmaintenance,  resulting  in  decreased  recurrent  costs  over  the \nmedium  and  long  term.  These  will  lead  to  overall  social  and \neconomic development in Madhya Pradesh. \n \nPoverty incidence is significantly higher in Madhya Pradesh than \nin India overall. The Project will improve access to socioeconomic \nservices, increase employment opportunities, and improve means \nof  transport  services,  which  will  in  turn  reduce  poverty  in  the \nregion, and stimulate economic growth and human development \nin the state. Improved mobility will provide households with better \npaying jobs outside of their villages.  \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  risk  of  initial  delays  has  already  been  mitigated  through \nMPRDC\u2019s advance actions and TA provided by ADB. Training on \nsafeguard requirements has been provided to MPRDC staff to \nmitigate  the  potential  risk  of  initial  delays  due  to  procedural \nclearance.  The  TA  provides  support  to  due  diligence  for \nsubproject  approval.  Frameworks  for  safeguarding  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  have  been  set  up  so  that  network \ndevelopment  will  be  ensured  while  minimizing  or  nullifying \nnegative  impacts  on  land  acquisition,  involuntary  resettlement, \nand social and environmental aspects.  \n \nThe  sector  reform  agenda  reflects  the  context  of  the  state  of \nMadhya Pradesh in the institutional development action plan by \ntaking into account the rather short-term project duration, actions \ntaken by GOMP, and the recent GOMP policy recommendations.  \n \nThe risk of an inefficient and ineffective maintenance budget will \nbe mitigated by implementing budget monitoring systems for full \nutilization and road management systems for better planning and \nbudgeting through the TA. GOMP has increased its maintenance \nbudget,  which  substantially  covers  the  requirement  since  the \ncurrent  fiscal  year  2006/07  especially  due  to  provision  of  the \nGovernment  of  India\u2019s  grant-in-aide  under  the  12th  Finance \nCommission. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the Project, TA will be provided to support \nGOMP\u2019s sector development initiatives. MPPWD will be equipped \nwith  (i)  norm-based  planning  and  budgeting,  (ii)  improved \nbusiness  practices,  and  (iii)  improved  human  resources \nmanagement. An alternative realigned structure of the state\u2019s road \nsector  institutions  will  be  proposed  for  long-term  road  sector \nreform. The estimated cost of the TA is $1,250,000, of which ADB \nwill finance $1,000,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The TA consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. \n   \n \n ", " \n \nv\n     \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Project II. The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening of Madhya Pradesh Public \nWorks Department, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The state of Madhya Pradesh is located in center of India. Traffic from the surrounding \nstates passes through the state using the road and rail networks. Railways connecting north\u2013\nsouth and east\u2013west regions of India pass through Madhya Pradesh with a total length of about \n5,900 kilometers (km). However, due to the state\u2019s vast area, the railway services cannot \nprovide the desired connectivity to major economic zones and centers. The railway network \ntraversing  the  state  serves  the  needs  of  cross-country  traffic  more  than  those  of  Madhya \nPradesh. In total, 11 major districts in the state have little rail service. Civil aviation, ports, and \ninland waterways have a very limited role in the state\u2019s overall economy and transport services. \nAs a result, roads are the predominant mode of transport. \n \n3.  Madhya Pradesh has 72,000 km of roads, of which 60,000 km are surfaced. It has 4,286 \nkm of national highways, 8,728 km of state highways, 10,817 km of major district roads (MDRs), \nand 48,590 km of other district roads (ODRs)/village roads. The road network is 75 km/100 \nsquare km (km2) in the country, and 45 in Madhya Pradesh. Surfaced roads, e.g., black-topped \nor bitumen, cement, or water-bound macadam, comprise 21.4 km/100 km2 in the country and \n8.4 in Madhya Pradesh. Most roads (85%) are surfaced; most (98%) unsurfaced roads such as \ngravel and earthen roads are in the ODR/village road category. Only 8% of state highways have \ntwo or more lanes, 52% are single lane; 90% of MDRs are single lane. All the ODRs/village \nroads are single lane. About half of the roads in each category of national highways, state \nhighways, and MDRs,  and 80% of ODRs/village roads are assessed to have deteriorated \nseverely and require major rehabilitation largely because of continuous shortfall in investment \non road maintenance until recently, and increasing volume of traffic and loads. Increasing and \nimproving the existing highway network in the state by widening existing carriageways, and \nstrengthening and constructing or reconstructing bridges and culverts is required. \n \n4.  Madhya Pradesh Public Works Department (MPPWD) is responsible for the state road \nnetwork. The Government of India\u2019s (the Government) Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, \nand  Highways  (MOSRTH)  administers  national  highways,  but  delegates  development  and \nmaintenance of these roads to MPPWD. MPPWD\u2019s district administrations manage most ODRs \nand village roads. In addition, the Madhya Pradesh Rural Roads Development Authority is \nresponsible for developing ODRs/village roads, which are funded through a special scheme \ninitiated by the Government (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana or PMGSY). For the state \nroad network, the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation (MPRDC) develops and \nmanages strategically important roads including all state highways and some national highways \ndelegated by MOSRTH and MDRs delegated by MPPWD. MPRDC also implements all build-\noperate-transfer (BOT) roads and bridges. \n ", "2     \n5.  MPRDC was established in line with a comprehensive reform under the ADB-funded \nMadhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector  Development  Program  (MPSRSDP).1 MPRDC  was \nincorporated as a company under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, primarily to take over the \nfunctions of the former Madhya Pradesh Rajya Setu Nirman Nigam Limited and to promote \npublic-private partnership projects in the road sector. It is wholly owned by the government of \nMadhya Pradesh (GOMP) and has been declared and notified as the highway authority under \nsection 4 of the Madhya Pradesh Highway Act, 2004. MPRDC has started functioning as the \nstate highway authority as was envisaged in the reform program. \n \n6.  MPRDC is a lean organization: using consultants for project preparation and supervision \nduring delivery periods, adopting modern procurement systems guided by FIDIC2 conditions, \nand setting up computerized road asset management and financial management systems. An \nADB TA strengthened MPRDC capacity. MPPWD, which implements all other state roads, \nfollows  the  Public  Works  Manual  designed  largely  in  line  with  the  Central  Public  Works \nDepartment manual. It lacks modern project management and procurement systems, and often \nexperiences cost and time overruns in project delivery. \n \n7.  Budgetary  expenditure  for  state  roads  in  2004/05  was  Rs673  crore3 ($150  million) \nagainst an original budget of Rs886 crore ($197 million). The extent of underspending was \nequivalent to 24% of the original budget. In 2005/06, the budget increased by 29% at Rs1,080 \ncrore ($240 million). The 2006/07 budget has increased further to Rs1,598 crore ($355 million). \nHowever, an increasing proportion of road sector spending is taking place outside the budget, \nespecially on Bond4/BOT roads. Reconstruction of more than 900 km of roads is planned under \nthe Bond/BOT scheme by 2007/08 at a total cost of about Rs950 crore ($211 million). This will \nbring the total length of Bond/BOT roads throughout the state to 2,000 km. \n \n8.  Revenues relating to road use include registration fees, vehicle taxes, passenger taxes, \nand goods tax were Rs560 crore ($124 million) in 2005/06, which increased from Rs393 crore \n($87 million) in 2001/02. The average annual increase is 9.4% with a substantial increase of \n15% during the last 2 years due to introduction of a smart card system for vehicle registration \nand tax payment. In addition, road users pay fees at border posts for overloading control; \ncommercial sales taxes such as vehicles, fuel, tires, and spare parts; central road fund share; \nand tolls to MPPWD and BOT concessionaires. Road users paid approximately Rs340 crore \n($76 million) in 2005/06 to GOMP and the Bond/BOT concessionaires. \n \n9.  The Madhya Pradesh Transport Department is responsible for licensing, registration, \nand regulation of motor vehicles, drivers, and passenger and freight transport. Motor vehicle \nregistration increased from 2.9 million in 2001 to 4.2 million in 2005, which is 9.4% increase per \nyear on average. Of 3.8 million motor vehicles registered, 76% were two wheelers. Of vehicles \nother than two wheelers, 43% were tractors/trailers, 20% cars and jeeps, 11% commercial \ntrucks, and 2% buses and minibuses. Motor vehicles on roads in Madhya Pradesh increased \nfrom 2.6 million in 2001 to 3.9 million in 2005, an average increase of 10.2% per year. \n \n10.  The  state-owned  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Road  Transport  Corporation,  which  was \nresponsible for about 3% of the state\u2019s buses, is being closed down in a phased manner. A \nnumber of government-operated routes have now been released for private sector operation, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Route \npermits are given for private operators. GOMP sets fares, which are generally followed. Truck \nhire rates are fixed by market demand. Competition is good. Private sector operators provide \nmost  of  the  services  for  passenger  and  freight  transport.  Madhya  Pradesh  Transport \nDepartment is also responsible for enforcing axle-load regulations. It has a system of 39 weigh \nstations at entry points into the state, and mobile squads to carry out its responsibilities. Traffic \npolice,  under  the  Home  Department,  are  responsible  for  enforcing  traffic  and  road  safety \nregulations. \n \n11.  The road accident rate in Madhya Pradesh was 12.4 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in \n2004, decreasing from 13.2 in 2001. The rate now has improved to the national average (12.8 in \n2003). However, it is still much higher than in Australia, Europe, Japan, and United States. \nAccidents are primarily due to driver error, followed by poor mechanical condition of motor \nvehicles.  \n \n12.  The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 \nprovides more details of the state road sector.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Main Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n \n13.  The state\u2019s road network requires improvement in terms of coverage and condition. \nDemands  for  road  transport  are  increasing.  Insufficient  funding  for  road  maintenance  has \nincreased the backlog of deferred maintenance. GOMP is now working to reduce the backlog of \ndeferred maintenance as set out in Refurbishing Roads in Madhya Pradesh.5 The state road \nrehabilitation program is to immediately strengthen and improve the state road network by \n2009/10. \n \n14.  GOMP also takes on sector development initiatives under the State Road Policy to \ndevelop and sustain the road network in accordance with Indian Roads Congress standards, \ndevelop efficient asset management systems, enhance the capacity for effective and efficient \nroad construction, attract private sector financing roads, and ensure high standards of road \nsafety and travel comfort.  \n \na.  Reform and Capacity Building in Road Sector Management \n \n15.  Under the MPSRSDP, substantial sector reform was achieved. Major achievements \ninclude  enactment  of  the  State  Highway  Act,  2004,  and  incorporation  of  MPRDC  and  its \nsubsequent notification as the highway authority for state highways. MPRDC has adopted best \npractices  of  planning  and  maintenance  systems,  financial  management,  and  procurement. \nMPRDC is now regarded as the benchmark for good practices in managing the state highway \nnetwork. GOMP highly appreciated the contributions made by the TA provided in parallel with \nthe MPSRSDP loan, especially in terms of establishing and building MPRDC capacity. MPPWD \nintends to adopt relevant MPRDC technologies and practices. \n \n16.  GOMP recently provided policy recommendations to improve MPPWD operations, which \ninclude  development  of  appropriate  road  development  plans,  improvement  of  MPPWD\u2019s \nbusiness  procedures  and  practices,  and  human  resources  management.  GOMP  recently \n                                                 \n5  Government of Madhya Pradesh. 2005. Refurbishing Roads in Madhya Pradesh. Bhopal. \n ", "4     \ndecided  to  abolish  the  letter-of-credit  system  to  streamline  administrative  procedures  for \ntransparent,  effective,  and  efficient  use  of  the  allocated  budget.  MPPWD  also  initiates \nenhancement of the planning capacity to prioritize roads for improvement on  the basis of \neconomic viability and to prepare condition-based budget allocation for maintenance. Such \ninitiatives include establishment of the Planning Unit at the state center, training of project \nmanagement skills, and pilot implementation of road management systems in selected districts. \n \nb.  Road Maintenance Financing \n \n17.  The nonplan budget has been substantially increased from Rs136 crore to Rs423 crore \nduring the past 5 years (from 2002/03 to 2006/07). The Planning Commission estimates the \nmaintenance requirement as Rs500 crore per annum. The budget allocation since the current \nfiscal year 2006/07 substantially covers the requirement especially due to provision of the \nGovernment\u2019s grant-in-aide (about Rs147 crore annually) under the 12th Finance Commission. \nAfter GOMP\u2019s road improvement program, the budget requirement for maintenance will be \nincreased and is estimated at Rs650 crore annually between 2009/10 and 2014/2015. Revenue \nrelating to road use is estimated at Rs557 crore in 2005/06, increasing by 15% from the \nprevious year, which is absorbed in the general government revenue. GOMP also established \nan  earmarked  reserve  known  as  the  Kisan  Road  Fund,  which  is  exclusively  used  for \ndevelopment and maintenance of state roads. About Rs100 crore to Rs120 crore has been \ncollected every year from a major portion (85%) of one half of market cess levied on agriculture \nproduce since 2001. \n \n18.  The primary concern is the efficient and effective utilization of the budget. Due to the \nstrong GOMP initiatives on effective use of gang labor, the increase to maintenance excluding \nsalary and wages is much higher, from Rs56 crore in 2002/03 to Rs296 crore in 2006/07. The \nshare of the salary/wage element in the nonplan budget is reduced from 70% in 2003/04 to 40% \nin  2006/07  (as  of  October  2006).  This  demonstrates  GOMP\u2019s  increased  commitment  to \nmaintenance  and  increased  efficiency  of  road  maintenance  works.  GOMP  is  expected  to \nimprove efficiency, e.g., further 30% reduction from the current level of the wage/salary element \nof maintenance works by the end of the Project. Increased construction quality due to inclusion \nof 3\u20135-year performance guarantee in civil works contracts will also increase the efficiency of \nmaintenance works and hence reduce maintenance costs. \n \nc.  Private Sector Participation \n \n19.  GOMP took on major initiatives to facilitate road development through public-private \npartnerships, such as enactment of the Madhya Pradesh Highway Act, 2004, and Indian Tolls \n(Madhya Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1992. The 1992 amendment of the Indian Tolls Act and the \nIndian Tolls (Madhya Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1992, empower GOMP to enter into contracts \nfor development of public roads and bridges with private entities, appoint them as lessees for \ncollection of tolls on contracted roads or bridges, and give them protection in the matter of toll \ncollection as if they were employed by GOMP. Currently, MPRDC manages 1,540 km of roads \nunder the BOT scheme. An additional 640 km is proposed to be developed under the BOT \nscheme in 2006/07. All state highway maintenance is now contracted out to the private sector. A \nmaintenance, operate, and transfer scheme has been introduced and will be applied to ADB-\nfunded roads where it is financially viable. MPRDC will explore more opportunities for applying \nBOT and maintenance, operate, and transfer schemes to high-density state roads. \n \n20.  MPPWD contracts all road improvement and part of periodic maintenance to the private \nsector. MPPWD will increase the contracting out of maintenance works by incorporating 3\u20135-\n ", "  5\nyear maintenance works into civil works contracts. This will be in accordance with the reduction \nin gang labor to keep roads in a maintainable condition. \n \nd.  Road Safety \n \n21.  The state Road Safety Council was reconstituted in 2006, chaired by a chief minister \nand comprising representatives of all government agencies, road user groups, and transport \nexperts concerned. Committees coordinate various efforts to improve road safety. District road \nsafety committees under the leadership of a district collector meet 2\u20134 times a year to review \nroad  safety  issues,  especially  a  road  safety  program  comprising  20  issues  such  as \nimplementation of improvements to road sections that are prone to accidents, e.g., geometry, \nguardrails and other protective measures at bridges and high embankments, advance warning \nmeasures to prevent accidents during the heavy rain season, reflective markers on the side of \ncarriageways,  and  use  of  helmets  and  seatbelts.  The  traffic  police  collects  and  analyzes \naccident data. Other initiatives taken by GOMP include road safety education included in the \nschool  curriculum,  establishment  of  trauma  care  centers,  and  setting  up  of  an  accident \nassistance number.  \n \n22.  MPRDC  has  established  a  road  safety  cell  to  institutionalize  safety  measures,  and \nmodified the accident investigation and prevention manual prepared for the Ministry of Shipping, \nRoad Transport and Highways under ADB TA6 to reflect local experiences and to adapt it to the \nroad network. The accident investigation and prevention manual was prepared in 1996 to guide \nhighway authorities and engineers in reducing road accidents and fatalities in India. Based on \nthis, MPRDC conducts a road safety audit to ensure safety features are incorporated in road \ndesign. MPRDC conducted a road safety audit for the proposed Project and the previous ADB \nproject (footnote 1).  \n \n23.  In  1996,  the  Government  recommended  establishing  the  Directorate  of  Safety  and \nTraffic Management and setting up a road safety fund, earmarking 1% of cess revenue for \nnational highways. An expert committee at MOSRTH will review these recommendations and \nfinalize a state road safety policy to address legal, institutional, and financial issues for road \nsafety. This will provide a new context for the funding and institutional setup for road safety at \nthe state level. \n \n    e.  Control of Overloading \n \n24.  The state has a legal framework for controlling overloading of vehicles. The weakness is \nthe lack of inspection, surveillance, and enforcement system to enforce it. GOMP (i) has drawn \nup a phased statewide program to strengthen and improve infrastructure at state border check \nposts to strengthen overloading control, (ii) is undertaking a rigorous inspection at border check-\npost locations, and (iii) has allocated funds for 10 electronic weigh bridges and surveillance \nmechanisms that MPRDC installed at the state borders and key locations on the road network \nunder the MPSRSDP (footnote 1). Private investors are being invited to install weigh bridges at \n26 other locations; GOMP will provide state support for their operation. As an added precaution \nagainst enforcement officers\u2019 laxity and corruption, closed-circuit television cameras are being \ninstalled and connected by satellites to the nearest road transport offices, allowing weighing \noperations to be monitored remotely. Collection of the composition fee has increased as a result \nof these efforts: in 2004/05, it was 27% higher than in 2003/04, and in 2005/06, 60% higher than \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to India for the National Highways Project. Manila. \n ", "6     \nin 2004/05. GOMP recently increased the composition fee by more than 100%, thus sensitizing \ntruck operators and discouraging them from plying overloaded trucks. In November 2005, the \nSupreme Court of India passed a judgment banning overloading of trucks to prevent premature \ndamage to roads, and mandated that excess cargo be offloaded at the risk and cost of the \nvehicle owner before the truck would be permitted to continue its journey, even after payment of \nthe penalty. GOMP\u2019s efforts are expected to eventually reduce vehicle overloading. \n \n25.  Key  sector  development  initiatives  undertaken  are  summarized  in  the  institutional \ndevelopment action plan (Appendix 3). \n \n  2.  External Assistance and ADB Strategy \n \n26.  The road sector in India has received substantial external assistance in the recent past. \nADB has provided loans and TA amounting to about $3.4 billion. The World Bank has provided \nloans  and  grants  amounting  to  $5.6  billion  to  upgrade  national  highways,  improve  state \nhighways,  and  upgrade  rural  roads.  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  has \nprovided five loans amounting to $0.33 billion to upgrade national highways and construct \nbridges. The government of the United Kingdom has provided TA support for the sector. ADB\u2019s \nsupport for the road sector has been developed in close collaboration with these key players. \nCoordination with the World Bank has particularly been active for transport. Mini-retreats for \ntransport operations in the South Asia region have become a regular practice for headquarters \nstaff.  For  the  resident  missions,  a  broad-based  sector  collaboration  mechanism  has  been \ninstituted to facilitate the exchange of information between key sector coordinators of both \ninstitutions. With the Japanese Government and JBIC, cooperation has been active, particularly \nfor railway and urban sectors. ADB has formed a close partnership with the Department for \nInternational Development (United Kingdom) in the provision of TA for areas that contribute to \npoverty  reduction  in  India.  The  two  organizations  regularly  hold  coordination  meetings.  A \nsummary of external assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \n27.  Since 2002, ADB has provided three loans to improve India\u2019s state road network\u2014to \nMadhya Pradesh in 2002, Chhattisgarh in 2003, and Uttaranchal in 2006. Other state road \nprojects under preparation for the eight northeastern states are in the 2007 pipeline; and the \nsecond project for Chhattisgarh and the first for Jharkhand, both of which are in the 2008 \npipeline. In principle, ADB provides support to improve state road sector management capacity \nalong with physical investment to improve the state road network. The first loan demonstrated \nmajor sector reform achievements, including establishment of MPRDC and its adoption of best \npractices  for  planning  and  maintenance  systems,  financial  management,  and  public \nprocurement. GOMP requested the proposed Project based on the substantial progress with \nsector reforms under the first ADB assistance (footnote 1) to pursue sector development and \nimprove the state road network. \n \n  3.  Lessons \n \n28.  Many ongoing ADB-financed road sector projects in India are experiencing delays. The \nMPSRSDP  is  no  exception.  These  delays  are  mostly  attributable  to  (i)  lack  of  safeguard \nconsideration in selecting and preparing investment, and insufficient support in safeguards \nplanning and implementation; and (ii) the gap in support between the feasibility phase and \nconstruction  to  executing  agencies,  which  are  often  not  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  in \nprocurement of civil works contracts and recruitment of consultants. \n \n ", "  7\n29.  MPRDC  acquired  substantial  experience  under  the  MPSRSDP.  GOMP  engaged \ndetailed project report consultants to prepare projects and asked ADB for TA7 to support the \npreconstruction  activities  of  MPRDC  so  that  the  construction  can  be  commenced  without \nunnecessary delay after loan approval. MPRDC took actions to facilitate advance clearance of \nquarry sites and utility shifting, and will have the supervision consultants involved in finalizing \ndrawings.  GOMP  also  initiated  advance  actions  for  contracting  such  as  engagement  of \nconstruction  supervision  consultants  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents.  GOMP  further \ntakes policy initiatives for speedy completion of construction works such as regular monthly \ndistrict review meetings to expeditiously resolve issues encountered during implementation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n30.  The  Project  will  improve  transport  efficiency  of  the  state  road  network,  which  will \ncontribute to expansion of economic opportunities and poverty reduction. This will be realized by \n(i)  improving  the  state  road  network,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  and  appropriate  road  usage,  (iii) \nincreasing efficiency of transport services, and (iv) enhancing GOMP capacity for road asset \ndevelopment and management. Improved roads will improve accessibility to social services and \nmarkets, and enhance the efficiency of road transport usage. With the central location of the \nstate in the country, the Project will improve transport efficiency for the rest of India.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n31.  Investment Component. The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct about 1,800 km of \nstate roads identified under the state road rehabilitation program, which identifies about 10,000 \nkm of state roads for rehabilitation and improvement. During feasibility studies, GOMP initially \nselected more than 4,000 km of state roads, and a list of about 1,800 km of state roads was \nidentified for the Project, taking into account preliminary assessment of traffic volume, social \nand environmental impacts, improvement to the overall state road network, state priority, and \nproject  readiness  (Appendix  5).  Road  improvement  works  under  the  Project  include \nrehabilitating and improving existing roads; strengthening existing culverts and bridges, and \nconstructing new bridges and cross-drainage structures. Based on the feasibility study and the \nproject  selection  and  prioritization  report,  the  candidate  subprojects  will  be  reviewed  and \napproved in accordance with a set of selection criteria (Appendix 6). Consulting services will be \nprovided to support implementation of the civil works.   \n \n32.  Institutional Development Component. The Project will provide equipment necessary \nfor GOMP to enhance sector capacity, such as road safety and control of overloading. Major \nequipment includes those for safety training, vehicle fitness testing, and weigh bridges. A TA will \nbe attached to the loan to support GOMP initiatives of sector development, especially for \nMPPWD reform and capacity building, including (i) enhancing planning capacity, (ii) improving \nbusiness processes, (iii) improving human resources management, and (iv) increasing private \nsector participation. The detailed institutional development action plan is set out in Appendix 3. \nThe consultants will identify the specification and timing of other equipment required during TA \nimplementation. \n \n                                                 \n7  A component TA of $250,000 for project preparation support for the Project was provided under the TA Cluster to \nIndia for Project Processing and Capacity Development (ADB. 2006.  Technical Assistance Cluster to India for \nProject Processing and Capacity Development. Manila.) \n ", "8     \nC.  Special Features \n33.  The Project was prepared with the enhanced capacity of MPRDC, which has been \ngained through MPSRSDP preparation and implementation, and ADB TA provided for capacity \nbuilding of MPRDC. MPRDC engaged detailed project report consultants with its own funds for \npossible  ADB  financing;  incorporating  ADB\u2019s  requirement  of  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental studies into the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. GOMP asked ADB for TA to \nsupplement the detailed project report consultants\u2019 work to fully comply with ADB requirements. \nEngineering design is prepared to minimize social and environmental impacts. Advance actions \nhave been taken to ensure that the construction can be commenced without unnecessary delay. \nAll of these are enabled by MPRDC\u2019s familiarity with ADB procedures and requirements, and \nMPRDC\u2019s enhanced capacity for project planning and implementation, which improved project \nreadiness,  mitigating  the  risk  of  delay.  The  Project  demonstrates  the  success  in  capacity \ndevelopment of MPRDC in preparing and implementing state road projects. \n \n34.  The major constraints of the road sector in Madhya Pradesh are (i) limited physical \nnetwork of roads in terms of coverage and conditions, and (ii) limited resources of road sector \ninstitutions against the requirement of providing a road network in the vast area of the state. The \nfirst ADB assistance, the MPSRSDP, established MPRDC to manage the strategically important \nstate road network by adopting modern business practices for road asset development and \nmanagement. MPRDC is now regarded as the benchmark for good practice in managing the \nstate road network. By adopting the sector loan modality, the Project provides an opportunity to \nextend the capacity development efforts to MPPWD, enabling overall sector capacity to be \nenhanced in conjunction with improvements to the physical road network. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n35.  The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $400  million,  including  taxes,  duties, \ncommitment charges, and interest during construction (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 7.   \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta\nA.  Base Costb   \n  1.  Investment Component  324.4 \n  2.

Financing Plan \n36.  The Government has requested a loan of $320,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n37.  ADB will finance 80% of the total project cost, taking into account that (i) the Project is \npart of the $1.1 billion Madhya Pradesh state roads rehabilitation program for 2006\u20132009, \nexcluding  projects  under  National  Highway  Development  Program  (NHDP),  PMGSY,  and \nMPSRSDP; (ii) ADB provided a loan under the MPSRSDP with ADB cost sharing at 57.4% \n($150 million of the total project cost of $261.2 million), which has not encountered any issues of \ncounterpart funding with 42.6% government sharing; (iii) the Project is part of ADB assistance to \nthe Government\u2019s overall development program for the road sector, including the NHDP-III \n($12.5 billion by 2012) and PMGSY ($11 billion by 2009); (iv) 20 projects have been approved \nso far at the final stage of the current country strategy and program period (2003\u20132007), and the \naggregate ADB financing will not exceed the ADB\u2019s country cost-sharing ceiling of 70% during \nthat period; (v) state road development is the priority for ADB assistance in India and the Project \nserves less-developed areas in one of the poorest states; and (vi) the higher cost sharing by \nADB helps the fiscal reforms of the state. \n \n38.  The Government will provide the loan proceeds in local currency to GOMP on the same \nterms and conditions as received from ADB. GOMP will bear the foreign exchange risk on the \nloan. The financing plan for the Project is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  320.0  80.0 \nGovernment  80.0  20.0 \n  Total  400.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n39.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be GOMP acting through MPRDC. MPRDC is \nwholly owned by GOMP and was originally established as the project management unit for the \nMPSRSDP. It has been equipped with capacity to implement the Project. The Project will be \nimplemented based on the organizational structure indicated in Appendix 8. The chief engineer \nat  MPRDC  headquarters  will  be  designated  as  the  \u201cproject  in  charge\u201d  for  project \nimplementation.  The  Environmental  Cell  at  MPRDC  headquarters,  reporting  to  the  chief \nengineer, will be responsible for ensuring compliance with social safeguards and engineering \n ", "10    \naspects  of  subprojects.  Seven  project  implementation  units,  located  in  the  divisions,  each \nheaded by a divisional manager will be responsible for subproject implementation in the field. \nOne or two full-time project managers will be assigned for each contract package. The divisional \nmanagers will be delegated adequate technical and administrative authority for expeditious \nproject implementation. Construction supervision consultants engaged by MPRDC will act as \nthe engineer for the construction contracts.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n40.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  inclusive  of  procurement  and \npreconstruction activities in 2007, and is expected to be completed by 30 June 2010. The \nimplementation schedule is included in Appendix 9.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n41.  Procurement to be financed from the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). The civil works have \nbeen packaged into a number of contracts in accordance with the geographic location and size \nof the contracts. The civil works contracts will be undertaken in 15 contract packages (Appendix \n10). All these contracts are estimated at more than $10 million and will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. ADB standard bidding documents for large works \nwith  postqualification  under  the  two-envelope  system  will  be  adopted.  Equipment  financed \nunder  the  Project  will  be  $1  million  under  the  institutional  development  component,  and \nprocured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  if  the  estimated  contract  is \nbetween $0.1 million and $1 million, and shopping if the estimated contract amount is less than \n$0.1 million. Contract packaging for equipment will be based on required technical features and \ntiming of procurement; the TA consultants will finalize detailed specifications and identify the \npackages during TA implementation. The procurement plan is in Appendix 11. NCB procedures \nadopted for procurement of goods and services under the Project will use the advertised tender \nenquiry method stipulated in the Government\u2019s General Financial Rules,8 as reflected in the \nprocurement plan. Any modifications to the procurement plan will be subject to prior approval by \nADB. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  MPRDC will select two internationally recruited consulting firms to supervise construction \nof civil works under the Project. One consultant will be engaged for Bhopal region and the other \nfor Jabalpur region. MPRDC will select and engage the consultants using ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based  selection  procedures  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (using the full technical proposal method) as reflected in the procurement plan. The \noutline terms of reference for consulting services for construction supervision are provided in \nSupplementary Appendix A. About 56 person-months of international and 1,760 person-months \nof national consultants are expected to be required. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting \n43.  The  process  of  advance  contracting  has  been  initiated  for  recruiting  construction \nsupervision  consultants  as  normal  procedures.  ADB  management  has  approved  advance \n                                                 \n8  Compilation of General Financial Rules (2005) and Compendium of Rules on Advances to Government Servants \nalong with circulars, Government decisions, and other relevant materials, Nabhi Publication, 2006. \n ", "  11\ncontracting  of  civil  works.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance \nprocurement action does not in any way commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  GOMP,  and  MPRDC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n45.  Under the MPSRSDP, MPRDC was created to provide efficient project implementation, \nadopting international best practices for asset management systems, financial management \nsystems, and procurement procedures. Roads under public-private partnership schemes have \nincreased to 1,500 km. MPRDC discloses its activities including information of tender call and \nproject implementation to the public through its website. GOMP also takes initiatives to improve \ngovernance in MPPWD, including a recent major step of abolishing a letter-of-credit system to \nstreamline administrative procedures for transparent, effective, and efficient use of the allocated \nbudget. The efficiency of the road maintenance budget has also been improved and is closely \nmonitored. To enhance overall road sector management, a TA will be attached to the loan to \nprovide  institutional  strengthening  of  MPPWD,  which  will  improve  governance  in  road \nadministration  and  accountability,  and  create  an  environment  encouraging  competition  and \nefficiency within MPPWD and the construction industry. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be \nused  for  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and  equipment.  Any  individual  payment  to  be \nreimbursed under statement of expenditure procedures will not exceed $100,000. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n47.  For  the  Project,  MPRDC  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify the goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, expenditures incurred, and \nuse of local funds under the project components and their subprojects. The accounts will be set \nup  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Independent  private  sector  auditors, \nacceptable to ADB, will audit MPRDC\u2019s accounts and related financial statements annually. \nMPRDC will submit the audited reports to ADB within 9 months of the close of each financial \nyear. \n \n48.  MPRDC will prepare and provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on progress made \nduring the review period, changes if any of the implementation schedule, problems or difficulties \nencountered  and  remedial  actions  taken,  anticipated  problems  and  proposed  remedial \nmeasures, and work to be undertaken in the following period. MPRDC will submit the quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB within 45 days from the close of each quarter. These reports will also \n ", "12    \ninclude  a  summary  financial  account  for  each  subproject,  expenditures  to  date,  report  on \nperformance monitoring, and the results of monitoring of the social and environmental impacts. \n \n49.  MPRDC will prepare and provide ADB with a subproject completion report within 3 \nmonths of physical completion of each individual subproject, and a project completion report \nwithin 3 months of completion of transactions under the Project. These reports will include a \ndetailed evaluation of subprojects and the overall Project, respectively, covering the design, \ncosts, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of \nreturn, and other details relating to the Project as may be requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  MPRDC  will,  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  develop  a  systematic  project \nperformance monitoring system, in a form and substance acceptable to ADB, for use throughout \nthe life of the Project. \n \n51.  The project performance monitoring system will follow the baseline for performance \nindicators to be used for monitoring implementation of each subproject. In accordance with the \nsystem, MPRDC will conduct evaluation surveys annually under each subproject to evaluate the \nscope, implementation arrangements, progress, and achievements of project objectives. \n \n10.  Project Review \n52.  ADB and GOMP will meet regularly as required to discuss project progress and any \nchanges  to  implementation  arrangements  or  remedial  measures  required  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of the subprojects and Project. In January 2009, ADB, the Government, GOMP, and \nMPRDC will undertake a midterm review of the Project. The review will focus on issues related \nto  implementation  arrangements,  and  agreement  on  changes,  if  needed,  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of the Project. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n53.  A  TA  for  $1,000,000  for  Institutional  Strengthening  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Public \nWorks Department will be provided to support GOMP\u2019s sector development initiatives set out in \nthe action plan (Appendix 3). The objective is to strengthen MPPWD\u2019s capacity in road asset \ndevelopment and management. During TA implementation, MPPWD will be equipped with (i) \nnorm-based planning and budgeting, (ii) improved business practices, and (iii) improved human \nresources management. An alternative realigned structure of the state\u2019s road sector institutions \nwill  be  proposed  for  long-term  road  sector  reform.  The  previous  ADB-financed  TA  for \nInstitutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for the Madhya Pradesh State Road Sector in \n2002 successfully developed the capacity of MPRDC, which adopted best practices of planning \nand maintenance systems, financial management, and procurement. The proposed TA will \nmake recommendations to modernize MPPWD\u2019s operations, adopting MPRDC technologies \nand practices in the context of the MPPWD environment. MPPWD will be the Executing Agency \nfor the TA. \n \n54.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan, and be carried out by an international consulting firm, to be recruited \nusing  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (using the simplified technical proposal method). The TA \nwill be implemented during 12 months from October 2007 to September 2008. International \n ", "  13\nconsulting inputs of about 30 person-months and national inputs of about 40 person-months are \nrequired. Terms of reference for the TA are in Supplementary Appendix B. Major equipment to \nbe purchased includes computers and software for project management, financial management, \nand road asset management. The TA consultants will identify the specification and timing of \nother equipment required. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Institutional and Operational Improvements \n \n55.  Improving management of the state road network through the institutional development \ncomponent and the TA, and improvement of the road network under the Project will enhance \nthe overall road condition and usability, thus increasing travel speeds and reducing travel time, \naccidents, and overloading. The enhancement of MPPWD\u2019s capacity in road asset development \nand management will improve governance in road administration and accountability, and create \nan environment encouraging competition and efficiency within MPPWD and in the construction \nindustry. This will ensure more efficient road asset development and management, and higher \nquality  of  construction  and  maintenance,  resulting  in  decreased  recurrent  costs  over  the \nmedium and long term. These will lead to overall social and economic development in Madhya \nPradesh. \n \nB.  Economic Assessment \n \n56.  The approach used to evaluate the Project follows the standard practice of comparing \nlife-cycle road agency and user costs with and without the Project, using net present value with \na 12% discount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The \nHighway  Development  and  Management  Model,  HDM-4,  was  used  for  the  analysis.  The \nanalysis focuses on savings in transport costs. Value added from better transport links resulting \nin new industries and employment are not quantified in this analysis but are captured through \nbenefits to generated traffic.  \n \n57.  The EIRR for the roads evaluated varied between 13% and 49%. The Project will be for \nthe state road sector rather than for individual roads. While the Project as a whole is robust, \nsome individual roads are marginal. Options such as reducing the formation width could be \nconsidered if the costs turn out higher than anticipated at the detailed design stage. \n \n58.  The sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i) \nconstruction costs increase by 15%; (ii) no time saving; (iii) benefits decrease by 15%; and (iv) \n50% reduction to generated traffic in addition to a combination of (i) and (iii). The results show \nthat the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. Three of the roads \nhave an EIRR below 12% in some of the sensitivity analysis cases. The EIRRs in these cases \nrange from 9.9 % to 11.6%, marginally below 12%. These three roads serve relatively less-\ndeveloped  areas  of  the  state  and  their  improvement  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \ndevelopment of these areas. Considering their positive development impact and the fact that \neven in the worst case sensitivity scenario, they have an EIRR more than 9%, these three roads \nare recommended for implementation under the Project along with all other roads included in \nthe analysis. Details of the economic assessment are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n \n \n ", "14    \nC.  Financial Sustainability \n \n59.  Incremental recurrent costs associated with the Project are estimated at 7%\u20138% of the \ncurrent MPPWD maintenance budget and 2% of the overall MPPWD budget on an annual \nbasis. The maintenance will be required after project completion in 2010 and the appropriate \nbudget increase is expected, considering the trend in recent years. Funds are expected to be \navailable  to  meet  these  costs.  For  financially  viable  road  sections,  MPRDC  will  apply  the \nmaintenance,  operate,  and  transfer  scheme to  finance maintenance  outside  of  the  GOMP \nbudget. \n \nD.  Social Impacts \n \n1.  Poverty Reduction and Social Impact \n \n60.  Madhya Pradesh is one of the most economically backward states in the country with \n37.06% people living below the poverty line, significantly higher than India\u2019s average of 27.09%. \nThe estimated annual per capita income of those living below the poverty line in the state is \nRs3,889.32 (less than $90). The state also ranks low in terms of the human development index, \nwhich is 0.394 in comparison to the national value of 0.472.  \n \n61.  An initial poverty and social assessment was undertaken during project preparation on \nthe core sample subproject. The assessment indicates that agriculture is the mainstay of the \npeople in the area, with the majority deriving their livelihood from agriculture and labor (both \nagricultural and nonagricultural). In some subproject sections, mainly towns and marketplaces, \nsome  depend  on  small  trade  and  business  for  their  livelihood.  Seasonal  migration  to \nneighboring districts and states for employment is a common feature with a number of sample \nhouseholds (21% of the surveyed households) in the subproject villages migrating for 2\u20133 \nmonths to work on construction sites and other nonagricultural wage labor opportunities. The \nconsiderable range between high and low income groups and high incidence of poverty, in \nkeeping with the state data, is reflected in the sample subproject area with 42% of the total \nsample households covered during the socioeconomic survey comprising poor households.   \n \n62.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  deteriorated  and  damaged  state  roads  of  Madhya \nPradesh  to  provide  reliable  road  transport  services.  The  Project  is  expected  to  stimulate \neconomic growth and human development in the state by improving access to socioeconomic \nservices  and  providing  a  better  quality  of  life  for  project  beneficiaries  in  the  long  term. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n2.   Gender \n \n63.  Madhya Pradesh ranks 28th among other states on the gender disparity index with a \nvalue of 0.6629 in comparison to the national average.10 The gender ratio of the population is \n920 females for every 1,000 males (2001 census). The literacy rate is 64.11%; 76.80% for \nmales and 50.28% for females (2001 census). Focus group discussions were undertaken with \nwomen from varying socioeconomic groups in the sample subproject. The assessment identified \nthat women in most socioeconomic groups are disadvantaged by their low status in households \nand communities in terms of access and control, which are among the significant reasons for \n                                                 \n9  National Planning Commission, Government of India. 2001. National Human Development Report. New Delhi.  \n10  India, with a gender disparity index value of 0.574, ranks 103rd in the World (United Nations Development \nProgramme. 2003. Human Development Indicators. New York.) \n ", "  15\nwhy women are constrained from actively participating in society consequently hampering the \nprocess of their empowerment and development. \n \n64.  The Project will have positive impacts on both men and women, and offer special \nbenefits to women by increasing the opportunity for girls to access higher education, and the \naccess of women and children to improved local services and higher levels of health care \noutside the village.  \n \n3.  HIV/AIDS \n65.  India is on the brink of one of the biggest public health challenges in its history. National \nAids Control Organization statistics report HIV/AIDS estimates for India for 2004 as 5.134 \nmillion infections, and note that HIV infection is typically concentrated among poor, marginalized \ngroups,  including  sex  workers,  drug  users,  migrant  laborers,  and  truck  drivers  who  are \ncategorized  as  \u201chigh  risk  groups.\u201d  These  groups,  particularly  truckers,  drive  the  HIV/AIDS \nepidemic and many studies indicate that infection is spreading rapidly to the general population. \nMadhya Pradesh, categorized as a \u201clow prevalence state\u201d with regard to HIV/AIDS, officially \nreported 1,729 cases of infection as of August 2006.11 The detailed study undertaken during \nproject preparation did not anticipate any risks of increased HIV/AIDS as a result of the Project. \nIn addition, state, district, and block campaigns by the health department and state AIDS \nControl Society are being undertaken to increase awareness of the disease. Interactions with \nthe chief medical health officer, AIDS counsellors, and block medical officers in the core sample \nsubproject indicate that annually 2\u20133 block awareness campaigns are organized to increase \nawareness of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n  4.  Human Trafficking \n \n66.  During  the  detailed  study  undertaken  during  project  preparation,  one  of  the  key \ncomponents was to assess the current status of human trafficking risks in the subproject areas \nand  project  implications.  Semistructured  interactions  were  undertaken  with  different  key \nstakeholders such as village head, men\u2019s and women\u2019s groups, village school teachers, as well \nas with district and block government personnel. No human trafficking risks were found in the \narea; none of the stakeholders reported any cases during the course of the study. Further the \ncommunity noted that due to the sociocultural setting of the area with society and villages \nhaving very close social and cultural ties, trafficking risks have not been identified. In addition, \nthough migration remains a common phenomenon in rural areas, this is largely a seasonal \nphenomenon limited to searches for labor opportunities to nearby growth centers to work on \nconstruction  sites  and  other  nonagricultural  wage  labor  to  sustain  livelihoods.  Both  the \ncommunity consultations and socioeconomic survey in the subproject area identified that for \nmigrating families, generally the men seasonally migrate without women and children thereby \nfurther reducing the possibility of trafficking via migration. Since all the subprojects are existing \nstate roads, the proposed augmentation is not expected to lead to human trafficking in the area.    \n \n5.  Indigenous Peoples \n \n67.  Madhya Pradesh, as per the Census of India 2001, has a population of 12,233,474 \nscheduled tribe members, constituting 20.3% of the total state population compared to 8.2% of \nthe national population. Some presence of indigenous peoples groups such as \u2013 Gonds and \nBaiga was noted on the sample subproject section passing through districts of Dindori, Mandla, \n                                                 \n11  Source: National AIDS Control Organization. \n ", "16    \nand Seoni. However, since the Project entails rehabilitation of existing road alignments, the \nsocial assessments have not identified any adverse impact on tribal groups within the area of \ninfluence of the project road. The assessment also notes that indigenous groups in the project \narea have been mainstreamed and assimilated into the local population. The study undertaken \nfor  project  preparation  did  not  indicate  differential  impacts  between  indigenous  and \nnonindigenous groups in project locations. The improved road network is expected to augment \naccess to socioeconomic facilities of tribal groups along with other sections of the subproject \npopulation.  The  subproject  construction  will  not  have  any  adverse  consequences  on \nsocioeconomic conditions and will not result in any disruption of their community life or culture of \ntheir communities. \n \n68.  An  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  was  prepared  for  the  Project  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) (Supplementary Appendix D) to be \nused if an indigenous peoples development plan is required.   \n \n6.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n \n69.  The Project entails rehabilitation of existing state roads, which will occur within the \navailable right-of-way; no land acquisition is expected. The project design avoids or minimizes \nthe  need  for  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  by  adopting  the  most  feasible \ntechnical design.  \n \n70.  The sample subproject was assessed for involuntary resettlement impact. Due diligence \nwas undertaken based on the preliminary designs and confirmed that the sample subproject will \nnot entail any involuntary resettlement and land acquisition impact.  \n \n71.  A resettlement framework has been prepared for the Project, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), to address any adverse resettlement impacts on assets \nsuch as land, structures, and cultural assets arising during detailed design and construction of \nthe sample subproject and for additional subprojects. Short resettlement plans (RPs), if required \nfor future subprojects, will be prepared in accordance with the agreed resettlement framework \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E).  MPRDC  will  ensure  that  under  contracts  for  civil  works  no \ncontractor  will  commence  construction  or  displace  people  until  those  affected  have  been \ncompensated in accordance with the resettlement plan acceptable to ADB. RP approval will be \nobtained prior to award of civil works contracts. MPRDC will translate all RPs under the Project \ninto local language and distributed them to the people affected. The RPs will also be posted on \nADB and MPRDC websites. Any changes to RPs based on detailed designs will also be subject \nto prior approval by ADB. \n \nE.  Environmental Impacts \n \n72.  The  overall  environment  categorization  for  the  Project  is  B.  However,  if  during \nimplementation any subproject selected will pass through national parks, sanctuaries, or other \nareas designated as environmentally sensitive, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) must \nbe  completed  for  the  subproject  following  the  procedure  described  in  the  environmental \nassessment review framework (EARF) (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n73.  The overall Project is not expected to have adverse environmental impacts as shown in \nthe findings of the initial environmental examination (IEE) of the sample subproject. This sample \nsubproject was selected as about 38 km of its 190 km length (about 20%) passes through \nseveral pacts of forested areas. The subproject IEE provides a picture of all potential generic \n ", "  17\nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  civil  works  of  the  Project  and  the  recommended \nmitigation  measures  for  the  sample  subproject,  which  could  be  adopted  for  follow-up \nsubprojects.  The  IEE  duly  shows  that  the  environmental  impact  will  mostly  occur  during \nconstruction and is mostly due to clearing for widening the carriageway, construction work \nrelated to compaction of the embankment and cut and fill, as well as from quarrying to support \nconstruction activities. The carriageway clearing is not expected to affect the forested area since \nthe available right-of-way has been 10\u201330 meters. The environmental impacts are all temporary \nand therefore, a further EIA is not required. Adequate mitigation measures have been provided \nand  are  summarized  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The  EMP  for  this \nsubproject was prepared to guide implementation of the mitigation measures. MPRDC will be \nresponsible for implementing overall mitigation measures with some to be implemented by the \ncontractors, especially mitigation measures during construction. The new Environmental Cell of \nMPRDC will be responsible for monitoring EMP implementation. The summary IEE, including \nthe EMP matrix, is presented in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n74.  The  environmental  assessment  of  the  follow-up  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and \nreviewed by following the procedure described in the EARF (Supplementary Appendix F). The \nEARF was formulated to ensure that follow-up subprojects will be prepared to comply with the \nGovernment and state laws and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). \n \nF.  Risks \n \n75.  A draft sector assistance program evaluation identified issues of state road projects in \nIndia, including (i) initial delays in implementation, (ii) risk of incomplete network development by \ntotal  avoidance  of  involuntary  resettlement  and  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  (iii) \nappropriateness of sector development framework, and (iv) a need for government discipline to \nefficiently and effectively secure the maintenance budget.  \n \n76.  The risk of initial delays has already been mitigated through MPRDC\u2019s advance actions \nand TA provided by ADB (Supplementary Appendix H). MPRDC is now familiar with ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  and  procedures  based  on  substantial  experience  gained  through  MPSRSDP \npreparation and implementation. Training on safeguard requirements was provided to MPRDC \nstaff to mitigate potential risk of initial delays due to procedural clearance. TA also provided \nsupport to due diligence for subproject approval. \n \n77.  Project roads were identified in accordance with strategic importance and the state road \nrehabilitation program. The Project will minimize/nullify any negative social and environmental \nimpacts through appropriate engineering design, which is possible as no populated areas have \nbeen identified along the project roads. In addition, frameworks for safeguarding social and \nenvironmental impacts have been set up so that network development will be ensured while \nminimizing/nullifying negative impacts on land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, and \nsocial and environmental aspects. \n \n78.  The risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated by reflecting the state \ncontext in the institutional strengthening action plan by taking into account the rather short-term \nproject duration, actions taken by GOMP, and recent GOMP policy recommendations.  \n \n79.  GOMP  has  increased  its  maintenance  budget,  which  substantially  covers  the \nrequirement  since  the  current  fiscal  year  2006/07  especially  due  to  the  provision  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s grant-in-aide under the 12th Finance Commission. The risk of inefficient and \n ", "18    \nineffective maintenance budget will be mitigated by implementing budget monitoring systems for \nfull utilization and road management systems for better planning and budgeting through the TA. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n80.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GOMP, and MPRDC have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nA.  Implementation \n \n81.  The Government will ensure that GOMP and MPRDC and other agencies at state level \nundertake  activities  and  respective  responsibilities  and  assurances  given,  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of the Project in a timely manner.  \n \n82.  GOMP will ensure that MPRDC and other agencies at state level undertake activities and \nrespective responsibilities and assurances given, to achieve the objectives of the Project in a \ntimely manner.  \n \n83.  GOMP will provide timely and adequate counterpart funds for the Project.  \n \nB.  Sector Development and Road Maintenance  \n \n84.  GOMP will implement measures included in the institutional development action plan \nduring the project implementation period and also implement the agreed recommendations of \nthe TA for institutional strengthening of MPPWD, in a timely manner. \n \n85.  The Government and GOMP will ensure that adequate and timely funding or other \nmechanism is available to MPRDC for maintenance of the roads improved under the Project. \n \nC.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Implementation \n86.  GOMP through MPRDC will ensure that all subprojects meet and are implemented, to \nthe satisfaction of ADB, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Appendix 6. \nD.  Environmental Considerations \n \n87.  GOMP through MPRDC will ensure that: \n \n(i)  the  Project  is  carried  out  and  all  project/subproject  facilities  are  designed, \nconstructed,  operated,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  compliance  with  the \nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government,  GOMP,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), and the EARF (Supplementary Appendix F); \n(ii)  an IEE or EIA report as required will be prepared, including an EMP with budget \nidentifying  the  cost  of  its  implementation  (as  incorporated  in  the  related \nprocurement  bid  document),  with  adequate  public  consultation  for  each \nsubproject, in accordance with the EARF. This will be submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval before the award of related civil works contract. The EIA or \nIEE for A or B sensitive subprojects as categorized under ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002) will be subject to prior approval of ADB before subproject approval \nbefore the 120-day requirement of public disclosure under ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002);  \n ", "  19\n(iii)  all  environmental  clearances  required  by  all  laws,  acts,  and  regulations  at \nnational, state and local levels are obtained in a timely manner and prior to \ncommencement  of  civil  works  for  the  relevant  section  of  the  subproject  as \napplicable;  \n(iv)  all mitigation measures identified in the IEEs, summary IEEs, EIAs, summary \nEIAs, and EMPs, prepared for the subprojects, as applicable, are incorporated in \nsubproject designs; and are carried out during their construction, operations, and \nmanagement; and are disclosed to stakeholders.  \n(v)  if there are any changes in specific locations or alignments of any infrastructure \nor project facilities after completion of the process of IEE or EIA or any new \ninformation is made available during detailed design and or implementation that \nhas an impact on the environmental assessment process carried out thus far, \nthen additional environmental assessment shall be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and the EARF, and prior approval of ADB shall \nbe obtained before further physical implementation of the relevant section of the \nsubproject as applicable; and \n(vi)  semiannual progress reports will be submitted to ADB on the implementation of \nthe EMPs, and measures under the IEE/EIA, and the environmental monitoring \ncarried out as a regular part of project implementation for review and disclosure \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). \n \nE.  Involuntary Resettlement; Indigenous Peoples \n \n88.  GOMP through MPRDC will undertake the Project in accordance with the Government \nand state laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the \nresettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \n89.  GOMP through MPRDC will  ensure that to the extent possible subprojects will not \nrequire  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement;  however,  if  land  acquisition  and/or \ninvoluntary resettlement are required for any subproject, GOMP through MPRDC will ensure  \nthat: \n(i)  all land, rights-of-way, and other land-related rights required for the subproject \nare acquired or otherwise made available to the project implementation units; \n(ii)  a short resettlement plan (RP) will be prepared for that subproject, acceptable to \nADB, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of GOMP, ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  resettlement  framework,  and \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval before award of the related civil works \ncontract;  \n(iii)  proper  consultation  during  preparation  of  RP  with  the  affected  persons  is \nundertaken and the RPs are disclosed to the affected persons including land \nacquisition and compensation process, and to the general public through the \nADB website; \n(iv)  if during detailed design and implementation, any modification and or additional \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, an RP will be \nprepared/modified in accordance with applicable laws and regulations referred \nherein,  and  the  resettlement  framework  and prior  approval  of  ADB  obtained \nbefore  further  implementation  of  the  relevant  section  of  the  subproject  as \napplicable;  \n(v)  all affected persons are compensated in accordance with the RP, the land and \nrights  in  land  are  made  free  from  any  encumbrances,  any  obstructions  are \n ", "20    \ncleared, all from the related section required to be handed over to the contractor \nfor and prior to commencement of construction thereof in accordance with the \nwork schedule under the related civil works contract; \n(vi)  efficient grievance redresses mechanisms are in place in accordance with the \nrelated RP to assist affected persons to resolve queries and complaints in a \ntimely manner; and \n(vii)  all  necessary  funds  are  available  in  a  timely  manner  so  that  the  RPs  are \nimplemented and full reimbursement for acquired assets is made to the affected \npersons well in advance so as to provide them sufficient time to make alternative \narrangements  before  commencement  of  the  relevant  section  of  civil  works \ncontract as applicable. \n \n90.  In case of adverse impacts identified during planning, design, and implementation of any \nsubproject  on  indigenous  people,  GOMP  through  MPRDC  will  ensure  that  an  indigenous \npeoples development plan or integration of specific actions in favor of indigenous people in the \nRP,  is  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  the \nindigenous peoples development framework (Supplementary Appendix D) and that the same is \nfurther  (i)  approved  by  ADB  before  award  of  the  related  civil  works  contract,  and  (ii) \nimplemented before commencement of the relevant section of civil works contract as applicable. \nAny update of the indigenous peoples development plan due to detailed designs or during \nimplementation  shall  follow  requirements  similar  to  the  RPs  as  described  for  involuntary \nresettlement. \n \nF.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking; Labor \n \n91.  GOMP through MPRDC will ensure that the civil works contracts under the Project \nincorporate provisions to the effect that the contractors will (i) carry out HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking  awareness  programs  for  labor;  (ii)  not  employ  or  use  children  as  labor;  (iii) \ndisseminate information at worksites on risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS as \npart of health and safety measures for those employed during construction; and (iv) follow and \nimplement all statutory provisions on labor (including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, \nwelfare,  sanitation,  and  working  conditions.  The  civil  works  contract  will  also  provide  for \ntermination of the contract by GOMP through MPRDC in case of breach of any of the stated \nprovisions by the contractors. \n \nVII.

", "Appendix 2  23\nROAD SECTOR ANALYSIS IN MADHYA PRADESH \n \n1.  The state of Madhya Pradesh, formed on 1 November 1956, comprises 43 districts. \nSubsequently, two large districts were bifurcated, and in 1998 16 more districts were constituted. \nThe  Chhattisgarh  region,  comprising  16  districts,  was  separated  to  form  the  new  state  of \nChhattisgarh. The reorganized state of Madhya Pradesh came into existence on 1 November \n2000 with 45 districts. The total geographic area of the state is now 308,000 square kilometers. \nIt is situated in the very heart of India and is surrounded by five states: Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, \nMaharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. \n \n2.  Because of the state\u2019s central location, traffic from surrounding states passes through \nthe state road and rail network. Railways connecting north\u2013south and east\u2013west regions pass \nthrough Madhya Pradesh with a total length of about 5,900 kilometers (km). However, due to \nMadhya Pradesh's vast area, the railway services cannot provide the desired connectivity to \nmajor economic zones and centers. The railway network traversing Madhya Pradesh serves the \nneeds of cross-country traffic more than those of Madhya Pradesh. In total, 11 major districts in \nMadhya Pradesh have little rail service. Civil aviation, port, and inland waterway have a very \nlimited role in the state\u2019s overall economy and transport services. As a result, roads are the \npredominant mode of transport services. \n \nA.  Road Network and Traffic \n \n3.  In 2006, the road network in Madhya Pradesh was as presented in Table A2.1. \n \nTable A2.1: Road Length in Madhya Pradesh \nNo.  Class of Road  Length (km) \n1  National Highways   4,286 \n2  State Highways   8,728 \n3  Major District Roads   10,817 \n4  Other District Roads/Village Roads   48,590 \n  Total Length   72,421 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Madhya Pradesh Public Works Department Annual Administration Report 2005\u20132006,  \ncorrect as of March 2006. \n \n4.  Not all roads are of the same type in terms of width or quality. If the type of road surface \nis taken as an indicator of quality, then most of the higher class of roads have been provided with \na sealed (bitumen or concrete) surface while the less important remain unsealed (metalled or \ngravel). Table A2.2 shows the current status of the road network within the state. About 628 km \n(8%) of state highways and 1,607 km of major district roads (15%) remain unsealed. While \nsealing all roads may be desirable, the implications in terms of the huge capital investment \nrequirement and commitment for recurring maintenance expenditure require such decisions to be \ntaken on the basis of sound economic analysis. \n.

The carrying capacity of a road is governed by its carriageway width. Building wide roads \nwhen not warranted by traffic density does not make economic sense. Consequently, nearly half \nthe state highways, most of the major district roads, and all other district roads are single lane. \nTable A2.3 indicates the distribution of roads by carriageway width. \n \nTable A2.3: Distribution of Roads by Carriageway Width (%) \nPercent of Road Length  \nNo.  Class of Road  Single  Intermediate  Two or More \nTotal \nLane  Lane  Lanes \n1  State Highways  52  40  8  100 \n2  Major District Roads  90  9  1  100 \n3  Other District Roads  100  0  0  100 \nSource: Madhya Pradesh Public Works Department \n \n6.  The number of motorized vehicles registered increased from 2.9 million in 2001 to 4.2 \nmillion in 2005, representing an average 9.4% increase per year. Of 3.8 million motor vehicles \nregistered, 76% were two-wheelers. Other than two wheelers, 20% were cars and jeeps, 11% \ncommercial trucks, 2% buses and minibuses, and 43% tractors/trailers. Motor vehicles on roads \nincreased from 2.6 million in 2001 to 3.9 million in 2005, an average 10.2% increase per year. \n \nB.  Institutions of State Roads Asset Management \n \n7.  Madhya Pradesh Public Works Department (MPPWD) is responsible for the 72,000 km \nstate road network. Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation (MPRDC) develops and \nmanages strategically important roads including all state highways, some national highways, \nand major district roads delegated by MPPWD. MPRDC also implements all build-own-transfer \n(BOT) roads and bridges. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways administers national \nhighways, but delegates development and maintenance of these roads to MPPWD. The district \nadministrations manage other district roads and village roads. The Rural Engineering Service is \ninvolved in the construction of rural roads and other rural civil engineering works. The Madhya \nPradesh Rural Roads Development Authority is responsible for developing other district roads \nand  village  roads,  which  are  funded  through  special  schemes  initiated  by  the  central \nGovernment.  \n \n  1.  MPPWD \n \n8.  MPPWD is responsible for the construction and maintenance of public buildings, roads, \nand other works on behalf of the government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP). The engineer-in-", "Appendix 2  25\nchief is the technical head of the department and professional advisor to GOMP on policy and \nimplementation related to public works. The engineer-in-chief reports to the MPPWD principal \nsecretary and secretary. MPPWD is organized into six zones of which five are responsible for \nconstruction and maintenance of roads including other district roads and village roads. The \nzones are headed by chief engineers located at Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, and Rewa. \nThe  chief  engineers  are  responsible  for  policy  implementation  and  overall  supervision  of \nMPPWD administration at the zone level, and construction and maintenance of works within the \nzone. \n \n9.  Before 2000, 25 circle offices were headed by superintending engineers in the zones. \nThey were responsible for supervision of the district division offices and were important links \nbetween  the  districts  and  the  state.  After  these  offices  were  abolished  in  2000,  a  gap  in \nsupervision and coordination was noted. The circle offices have been reinstated. \n \n10.  Each circle office is responsible for 4\u20135 works divisions. Each district has about two \ndivisions; the current 45 districts have 83 divisions. The divisions are the basic operating units \nand  are  headed  by  executive  engineers,  who  are  responsible  for  management  of  works \nincluding management of contracts and payment for works. A division can handle an annual \nworkload of about Rs10 crore.1 \n \n11.  The divisions are divided into 3\u20134 subdivisions; the state has 264 subdivisions. The \nsubdivisions  are  headed  by  assistant  engineers,  who  manage  and  supervise  works.  This \ninvolves design and contract management including quality control and testing. The assistant \nengineers are required to check the quality and quantity (measurement) of works, and are \nauthorized to make staged payments to contractors and labor. Under every subdivision are 4\u20136 \nsections headed by subengineers, who are the basic field functionaries. They are responsible \nfor managing actual construction activity in the field, taking measurements, giving day-to-day \nguidance and reporting to the assistant engineer. \n \n12.  MPPWD also has an electrical and mechanical wing, which is responsible for installing \nand maintaining electricity supply in public buildings and maintaining department equipment \nincluding machinery for roads. The electrical and mechanical wing has 3 circles, 6 divisions, and \n48 subdivisions. \n \n13.  MPPWD  (i)  is  a  well-organized  department  with  clearly  defined  duties  and \nresponsibilities for all professional staff; (ii) has competent and qualified engineers and other \nsupport staff to manage the road network and buildings in urban areas; (iii) has tools, plant, and \nadequate staff to operate and maintain them in working condition; and (iv) has a well-defined \naccounting and auditing system managed under the overall government systems. However, \nMPPWD requires improvements in certain areas including quality control, works management, \nand human resources development and management. \n \n14.  Quality Control. Quality control of works is the responsibility of contractors under the \nsupervision of MPPWD staff. Contractors are responsible for establishing field laboratories and \ncarrying out mandatory tests for materials and quality of work. MPPWD does not have enough \nlaboratories or a well-defined system for testing and quality control in the divisions to enable \nrigorous testing. The state has one laboratory for testing and quality control for road works; \nevery  zone  has  a  regional  moratory.  However,  given  the  large  area  of  the  state  and  the \n                                                 \n1  A crore is equal to Rs10,000,000. ", "26  Appendix 2 \nextensive road network, adequate arrangements for quality control and testing of road material \nare needed. \n \n15.  Works  Management.  The  works  management  system  is  in  need  of  overhaul. \nAdherence to old codes and procedures sometimes result in project implementation delays. \nDecision making is not sufficiently decentralized. Operation decisions are delayed because of \ntoo many levels of interventions, and the tendency to adhere to established management and \nconstruction practices; staff are not motivated to accept new challenges. \n \n16.  Human Resources Development and Management. No regular arrangement seems \nto be in place to provide training and reorientation to officers of the department. The state does \nnot  have  a  single  research  or  training  institute  dedicated  to  the  roads  sector.  Cadre \nmanagement has not received due attention in PWD. Promotion prospects are poor and many \nprofessional staff remain at lower levels for long periods. Discussions with MPPWD officers \nindicate that many junior engineers remain at the same level for up to 20 years, as do assistant \nengineers.  Because  of  financial  stringency  and  overstaffing  in  GOMP  administration, \nrecruitment of new staff into government employment has been restricted to certain reserved \ncategories. During the last 10 years, virtually no assistant engineers have been recruited. \nImproved capability of engineering staff and reform of the human resources management policy \nare needed. The MPPWD engineers are competent but they are demoralized. Good results \ncannot  be  expected  without  increased  training,  capacity  building,  more  effective  cadre \nmanagement,  and  career  development  strategies.  Avenues  for staff  promotion have  to  be \nensured, particularly for lower level functionaries. \n \n  2.  MPRDC \n \n17.  MPRDC  was  established  in  line  with  a  comprehensive  reform  under  the  Madhya \nPradesh State Roads Sector Development Program.2 MPRDC was incorporated as a company \nunder the Indian Companies Act, 1956, primarily to take over the functions of the Madhya \nPradesh Rajya Setu Nirman Nigam Limited and to promote public-private partnership projects in \nthe Madhya Pradesh road sector. It was declared and notified as the highway authority under \nsection 4 of the Madhya Pradesh Highway Act, 2004. MPRDC has started functioning as the \nstate highway authority as was envisaged in the reform program. \n \n18.  MPRDC is a lean organization: using consultants for project preparation and supervision \nduring delivery, adopting modern procurement systems guided by FIDIC conditions, and setting \nup computerized road asset management and financial management systems.3 Its capacity was \nstrengthened with a technical assistance (TA) funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nMPRDC is headed by a managing director, supported by a chief engineer and two deputy \ngeneral managers (DGMs) for human resources and management information systems, and \nfinance and accounting. The chief engineer is supported by two general managers for planning \nand maintenance, and projects; and one DGM for BOT. The general manager for planning and \nmaintenance  has  two  sections:  (i)  planning  and  maintenance,  and  (ii)  road  safety,  which \nincludes the environment and social management unit. The general manager for projects has \nfour sections: (i) highway engineering, (ii) quality control, (iii) procurement, and (iv) bridge \n                                                 \n2  Asian Development Bank. 2002.

Manila. \n3  MPRDC\u2019s  finance  and  accounting  function  is  headed  by  a  deputy  general  manager  supported  by  a  chief \naccounting  officer  with  two  managers  (finance  and  accounts).  MPRDC  adopted  a  computerized  financial \nmanagement system under the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Development Program. The system has \nbeen commissioned and MPRDC officials are operating it. ", "Appendix 2  27\nengineering. Each section is headed by a DGM supported by an assistant general manager. \nMPRDC has seven division offices, which are in charge of day-to-day project and contract \nmanagement for each project. Each division office is headed by a DGM supported by five \nassistant general managers, 12 managers, and support staff. \n \n19.  MPRDC adopts a modern management structure including computerized systems of \nroad asset management and financial management. It has been equipped with capacity to use \nmodern systems. However, concerns about long-term knowledge and know-how accumulation \nin the organization are related to the large number of staff deputed from MPPWD. Also, weak \nskills in project and contract management are apparent at the division offices. GOMP initiates \nsupport  to  increase  the  number  of  MPRDC  regular  staff,  and  MPRDC  provides  training \nopportunities for the staff to develop skills in various areas. \n \nC.  Road Transport Regulation and Industry \n \n20.  The Madhya Pradesh Transport Department is responsible for (i) licensing, registration, \nand regulation of motor vehicles, drivers, and passenger and freight transport; and (ii) road \nsafety policy and enforcement of axle-load regulations. It has a system of 39 weigh stations at \nentry points into the state, and mobile squads to carry out its responsibilities. The department is \nheaded by a principal secretary and its functions are designed in accordance with the provisions \nof  the  Motor  Vehicles  Act,  1988.  The  principal  legislation  and  regulations  affecting  the \nfunctioning of the department are Motor Vehicles Act, 1988; Central Motor Vehicles Rules, \n1989; Madhya Pradesh Motor Vehicles Tax Act, 1991; Madhya Pradesh Motor Vehicles Tax \nRules,  1991;  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Motor  Vehicle  Rules,  1994.  Principal  functions  of  the \ndepartment are revenue collection; registration of vehicles; issuance of permits; inspection of \nvehicles and enforcement of penalties under various central and state laws and regulations; \nmonitoring,  implementation,  and  coordination  of  interstate  and  interregional  transport \narrangements;  prevention  of  vehicular  pollution  and  enforcement  related  regulations;  and \nmaintenance of statistical data for the use of central and state governments and transport \norganizations. Traffic police are responsible for enforcing traffic and road safety regulations. The \ntraffic police are under the Home Department. \n \n21.  To modernize its functioning, Madhya Pradesh Transport Department has recently taken \nseveral initiatives. Among the initiatives to control and check overloading of goods carrying \nvehicles, the department is installing electronic weigh bridges at all major border crossings with \nother states. This helps the state identify vehicles violating the gross vehicle weight and axle-\nload regulations besides earning substantial revenues from fines and penalties. MPDRC will \ndevelop some of the integrated border check posts on a BOT basis. \n \n22.  The  state-owned  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Road  Transport  Corporation,  which  was \nrunning about 3% of the state\u2019s buses, is being closed down in a phased manner. A number of \ngovernment-operated routes have now been released for private sector operation, and once the \ncorporation is closed, all routes will be released to the private sector. Route permits are given \nfor private operators. GOMP sets fares, which are generally followed. Truck hire rates are fixed \nby market demand. Competition is good. Private sector operators provide most of the services \nfor passenger and freight transport. \n \nD.  Road Expenditures and Revenues \n \n23.  Budgetary expenditure for state roads in 2004/05 was Rs673 crore ($150 million) against \nan original budget of Rs886 crore ($197 million). The extent of underspending was equivalent to ", "28  Appendix 2 \n24% of the original budget. The 2005/06 budget was 29% greater than the previous year at \nRs1,080  crore  ($240  million).  The  2006/07  budget  has  increased  to  Rs1,598  crore  ($355 \nmillion). However, an increasing proportion of road sector spending is taking place outside the \nbudget, especially on Bond4/BOT roads. Reconstruction of more than 900 km of roads is \nplanned under the Bond/BOT scheme by 2007/08 at a total cost of about Rs950 crore ($211 \nmillion). This will bring the total length of bond/BOT roads throughout the state to 2,000 km. \nTable A2.4 summarizes the plan and nonplan budget allocation in recent years. \n \nTable A2.4: MPPWD Budget Allocation and Expenditure (Rs crore) \n Item   2002/03  2003/04  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07a \nA.

Revenues relating to road use include registration fees; vehicle, passenger, and goods \ntaxes, and so on, and were Rs560 crore ($124 million) in 2005/06, which increased from Rs393 \ncrore ($87 million) in 2001/02. The average annual increase is 9.4% with a substantial increase \nin the last 2 years by 15% due to a smart-card system for vehicle registration and tax payment. \nIn addition, road users pay fees at border posts and to flying squads for overloading control; \ncommercial sales taxes such as vehicles, fuel, tires, and spare parts; central road fund share; \nand tolls to MPPWD and BOT concessionaires. Road users paid approximately Rs340 crore \n($76 million) in 2005/06 to the GOMP and the Bond/BOT concessionaires. \n \nE.  Main Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n \n25.  The road network of the state is very poor in terms of coverage and conditions, and \ndemands  for  road  transport  are  increasing.  Insufficient  funding  to  road  maintenance  has \nincreased the backlog of deferred maintenance. GOMP is working to reduce the backlog as set \nout in Refurbishing Roads in Madhya Pradesh, May 2005. This is a state road rehabilitation \nprogram  to  immediately  strengthen  and  upgrade  the  state  road  network  by  2009/10.  The \nprogram  (Table  A2.5)  intends  to  improve  some  22,000  km  of  state  roads  though  various \nschemes, including the central road fund, Bond/BOT schemes, and ADB assistance. \n                                                 \n4  Bonds roads are those financed under the Madhya Pradesh Infrastructure Investment Fund Scheme.

Refurbishing Roads in Madhya Pradesh. Bhopal. \n \n26.  GOMP also takes on sector development initiatives under the state road policy to (i) \ndevelop and sustain the road network in accordance with Indian Roads Congress standards, (ii) \ndevelop  efficient  asset  management  systems,  (iii)  enhance  the  capacity  for  effective  and \nefficient road construction, (iv) attract private sector financing to roads, and (v) ensure high \nstandards of road safety and travel comfort.  \n \n1.  Reform and Capacity Building in Road Sector Management \n \n27.  Under  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector  Development  Program,  substantial \ndevelopment of the sector reform was achieved, including enactment of the State Highway Act, \n2004, and incorporation of MPRDC and its subsequent notification as highway authority for \nstate highways. MPRDC has adopted best practices for planning and maintenance systems, \nfinancial management, and procurement. MPRDC is now regarded as a benchmark of good \npractice in managing the state highway network. GOMP highly appreciates the contributions \nmade by the TA provided in parallel with the loan, especially in terms of establishing MPRDC \nand developing its capacity. MPPWD intends to adopt technologies and practices of MPRDC in \nthe context of MPPWD. \n \n28.  GOMP recently provided policy recommendations to improve MPPWD operations, which \ninclude  development  of  an  appropriate  road  development  plan,  improvement  of  MPPWD\u2019s \nbusiness procedures and practices, and human resources management. A major step taken by \nGOMP  is  to  abolish  the  letter-of-credit  system  to  streamline  administrative  procedures  for \ntransparent, effective, and efficient use of the allocated budget. MPPWD is also enhancing its \nplanning capacity to prioritize roads for improvement on an economic basis and to prepare a \ncondition-based budget for maintenance. Such initiatives include establishing the Planning Unit, \ntraining in project management skills, and pilot implementation of road management systems in \nselected districts. \n \n2.  Road Maintenance Financing and Operations \n \n29.  The nonplan budget has been substantially increased from Rs136 crore to Rs423 crore \nin the past 5 years (from 2002/03 to 2006/07). The maintenance requirement, estimated by the \nPlanning Commission, is Rs500 crore per annum. The budget allocation since the current fiscal \nyear  2006/07  substantially  covers  requirements  especially  due  to  the  provision  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s grant-in-aide (about Rs147 crore annually) under 12th Finance Commission. \nAfter the GOMP\u2019s road improvement program, the budget requirement for maintenance will be \nincreased and is estimated at Rs650 crore annually between 2009/10 and 2014/15. Revenue \nrelating to road use is estimated at Rs557 crore in 2005/06, increasing by 15% from the \nprevious year, which is absorbed in the general government revenue. GOMP also established ", "30  Appendix 2 \nan earmarked reserve, the Kisan Road Fund, which is exclusively used for development and \nmaintenance of state roads. About Rs100 crore\u2013Rs120 crore has been collected every year \nfrom a major portion (85%) of one half of market cess levied on agriculture produce since 2001. \n \n30.  Of concern is the efficient and effective utilization of the budget. Due to the strong \nGOMP initiative on effective use of gang labor, the increase to maintenance excluding salary \nand wages is much higher, from Rs56 crore in 2002/03 to Rs296 crore in 2006/07. The share of \nthe salary/wage element in the nonplan budget has been reduced from 70% in 2003/04 to 40% \nin  2006/07  as  of  October  2006  (Table  A2.4).  These  demonstrate  GOMP\u2019s  increased \ncommitment to maintenance and increased efficiency of road maintenance works. GOMP is \nexpected to further improve efficiency, e.g., further 30% reduction of the current wage/salary \nelement of maintenance works by the end of the Project. Increased construction quality due to \ninclusion  of  3\u20135-year  performance  guarantees  into  civil  works  contracts  will  increase  the \nefficiency of maintenance works and hence reduce maintenance costs. \n \n3.  Private Sector Participation \n \n31.  GOMP took on major initiatives to facilitate road development through public-private \npartnerships such as enactment of the Madhya Pradesh Highway Act, 2004, and Indian Tolls \n(Madhya Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1992. The 1992 amendment of the Indian Tolls Act and the \nIndian Tolls (Madhya Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1992, together empower GOMP to enter into \ncontracts for development of public roads and bridges with private entities, appoint them as \nlessees for collection of tolls on contracted roads or bridges, and give them protection in the \nmatter of toll collection as if they were employed by GOMP. Currently, MPRDC manages 1,540 \nkm of roads under the BOT scheme. An additional 640 km are proposed to be developed under \nthe BOT scheme in 2006/07. Maintenance of state highways is now 100% contracted out to the \nprivate sector. A maintenance, operate, and transfer scheme has been introduced and will be \napplied  to  all  ADB-funded  projects.  MPRDC  will  explore  more  opportunities  for  BOT  and \nmaintenance, operate, and transfer schemes for high-density state roads. \n \n32.  MPPWD contracts all road improvements and part of periodic maintenance to the private \nsector. It will increase the contracting out of maintenance works by incorporating 3\u20135-year \nmaintenance works into civil works contracts. This will be in accordance with the reduction of \ngang labor to keep roads in a maintainable condition. \n \n4.  Road Safety \n \n33.  The road accident rate in Madhya Pradesh was 12.4 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in \n2004, decreasing from 13.2 in 2001. The rate has now improved to the national average (12.8 in \n2003). However, it is still much higher than rates in Australia, Europe, Japan, and United States. \nAbout 30% of fatal accidents are head-on collisions. Most accidents are the fault of drivers, \nfollowed by defects in the mechanical condition of motor vehicles.  \n \n34.  The state Road Safety Council was reconstituted in 2006, chaired by a chief minister \nand  represented  by  all  government  agencies,  road  user  groups,  and  transport  experts \nconcerned. Committees have been established to coordinate various efforts to improve road \nsafety. District road safety committees under the leadership of a district collector meet 2\u20134 times \na year to review road safety-related aspects, especially a road safety program comprising 20 \nissues such as implementation of advance warning measures to prevent accidents during the \nheavy rainy season, reflective markers on the side of trucks, and use of helmet and seatbelts. \nOther initiatives taken by GOMP include road safety education, which is included in the school ", "Appendix 2  31\ncurriculum, establishment of trauma care centers, and provision of an accident assistance \nnumber.  The  traffic  police  are  responsible  for  accident  data  collection  and  analysis.  The \nrelatively high share of accidents due to mechanical defects is a concern. \n \n35.  A road safety cell has been formulated in MPRDC. MPRDC has modified the accident \ninvestigation and prevention manual prepared for the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and \nHighways under ADB TA5 to reflect local experiences and to adapt it to the road network under \nGOMP. The accident investigation and prevention manual was prepared in 1996 to guide \nhighway authorities and engineers in reducing road accidents and fatalities in India. Based on \nthis, MPRDC conducts a road safety audit to ensure safety features are incorporated in designs. \nMPRDC conducted road safety audits for the proposed Project and the previous ADB project \n(footnote 2).  \n \n36.  In  1996,  the  Government  recommended  establishing  the  Directorate  of  Safety  and \nTraffic Management and setting up a road safety fund, earmarking 1% of cess revenue for \nnational  highways.  An  expert  committee  at  the  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport,  and \nHighways will review these recommendations and finalize a road safety policy to address legal, \ninstitutional, and financial issues for road safety. This will provide a new context for state funding \nand institutional setup for road safety. \n \n5.  Control of Overloading \n \n37.  The legal framework is in place to control overloading of vehicles. The weakness is the \nlack of inspection, surveillance, and enforcement system to enforce it. GOMP has drawn up a \nphased statewide program to strengthen and improve infrastructure at state border check posts \nto strengthen overloading control. GOMP is undertaking a rigorous inspection at the border \ncheck-post locations. It has allocated funds for 10 electronic weigh bridges and surveillance \nmechanisms,  which  MPRDC  installed  at  the  state  borders  and  key  locations  on  the  road \nnetwork under the previous loan (footnote 2). Private investors are being invited to install weigh \nbridges at another 26 locations. GOMP will provide state support to their operation. As an added \nprecaution against enforcement officers\u2019 laxity and corruption, closed-circuit television cameras \nare being installed and connected by satellite to the nearest road transport offices, allowing \nremote monitoring of weighing operations. Collection of the composition fee has increased as a \nresult of these efforts: in 2004/05, it was 27% higher than in 2003/04, and in 2005/06, 60% \nhigher than in 2004/05. GOMP recently increased the composition fee by more than 100%, thus \nsensitizing truck operators and discouraging them from plying overloaded trucks. In November \n2005, the Supreme Court of India passed a judgment banning overloading of trucks to prevent \npremature damage to roads, and mandated that excess cargo be offloaded at the risk and cost \nof the vehicle owner before the truck would be permitted to continue its journey, even after \npayment of penalty. GOMP\u2019s efforts are expected to eventually reduce vehicle overloading. \n \n38.  Key  sector  development  initiatives  undertaken  are  summarized  in  the  institutional \ndevelopment action plan (Appendix 3). \n \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n1.   Unless modified or amended in the loan or project agreements, the Project will utilize the \nfollowing subproject selection criteria and approval process.  \n \n2.   A subproject will be eligible for financing under the Project if:  \n \n(i)  It is to improve existing state roads, and be part of the network implemented by \nthe MPRDC; \n \n(ii)  It is technically feasible least-cost and a detailed report prepared supporting such \nfeasibility; \n \n(iii)  An  economic  analysis  of  the  subproject  prepared  in  accordance  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Project shows \nthat the estimated economic internal rate of return will be at least 12%; \n \n(iv)  The subproject has been screened for its environmental impacts in compliance \nwith  the  requirements  of  India  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  an \nenvironmental  assessment  has  been  prepared  following  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures  as  specified  in  the  environmental \nassessment  review  framework  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB \n(Supplementary Appendix F), it avoids passing through any designated wild-life \nsanctuaries,  national  parks,  other  sanctuaries,  or  area  of  internationally \nsignificance (e.g. protected wetland designated by the Wetland Convention), it \navoids, as much as possible, passing through any cultural heritage designated by \nUNESCO and ADB has approved the environmental assessment and proposed \nmitigation measures; \n \n(v)  The  subproject  will,  to  the  extent  possible,  not  require  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement (which includes the displacement of squatters or encroachers from \nthe rights-of-way). If land acquisition or involuntary resettlement is required for a \nsubproject, the subproject should limit to category B where a short resettlement \nplan will be prepared in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of \nGOMP, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Operations Manual \nF2 on involuntary resettlement (2003); and the agreed resettlement framework \n(Supplementary Appendix E); \n \n(vi)  If any indigenous peoples/scheduled tribes are likely to be affected significantly \nby  a  subproject,  an  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  (IPDP)  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  indigenous  peoples  development \nframework (Supplementary Appendix D); \n \n(vii)  Sufficient counterpart funding has been allocated to implement the subproject \ntimely and efficiently in accordance with the overall implementation schedule; \nand; \n \n(viii)  For each subproject, all necessary Government approvals will be obtained. \n ", "Appendix 6  41\nB.   Approval Process \n \n3.  All subprojects will be prepared and processed in accordance with the procedures set \nout below. \n \n(i)  MPRDC will select a possible subproject from priority roads, which is part of the \nexisting network implemented by MPRDC. MPRDC will then conduct a feasibility \nstudy  for  the  subproject  including  its  cost  estimate,  technical  and  economic \nanalysis. EA will also prepare (a) an initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) \nand fill out a checklist for (b) involuntary resettlement; (c) indigenous people; and \n(d) environmental screening. \n \n(ii)  MPRDC  will  submit  (a)  appraisal  reports/project  selection  and  prioritization \nreports, (b) IPSA, and (c) the above checklists to ADB for further review, to \nobtain  necessary  guidance  with  regard  to  the  extent  of  relevant  analysis, \nassessment or plans. \n \n(iii)  ADB will review the reports submitted by MPRDC. If ADB finds that a proposed \nsubproject is not likely to satisfy the eligibility criteria and/or that the agreed \nprocedures, ADB will advise MPRDC either (a) to modify the subproject proposal \nin a manner that will make it eligible for approval; or (b) that the subproject must \nbe rejected.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      national priority in country poverty   \n      No  partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nThe Madhya Pradesh government recognizes that while economic growth and service delivery are crucial for poverty \nreduction, transport infrastructure development (aviation ports, roads, and railways) is critical as a catalyst for generating \neconomic activity and employment, and accelerating growth; as well as for providing better integration within the state and \nwithin the regions. \n \nThe Project will rehabilitate the deteriorated and damaged state roads of Madhya Pradesh to provide reliable road transport \nservices, which will improve access to socioeconomic services and better quality of life for the project beneficiaries and \nhence contribute to poverty reduction in the long term. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nThe main objective of the Project is to rehabilitate the existing state roads in Madhya Pradesh and augment existing \nconnectivity within the state. The Project will cover an estimated of 1,969.36 kilometers (km) of state roads hence creating a \nreliable and efficient road network within the state. Some of the immediate benefits will be in terms of improved access to \nsocioeconomic facilities, safe and comfortable travel with reduced fuel consumption and vehicle operating costs, and \ndevelopment of the rural economy. \n \nA socioeconomic baseline survey was undertaken on a sample subproject in Nov\u2013Dec 2006, based on a representative \nsample covering a total of 619 households. The social assessment and analysis of the secondary data reveal that agriculture \nis the mainstay of people in the area, with the majority deriving their livelihoods from agriculture and labor (both agricultural \nand nonagricultural). Some of the major crops grown in the area are wheat, soybeans, pulses, and maize. In some \nsubproject sections, mainly town portions and market places, some of the population is also dependent upon small trade and \nbusiness for fulfillment of their livelihood needs. Seasonal migration to neighboring districts and states for employment is a \ncommon feature of the area with a number of sample households (21% of the surveyed households) in the subproject \nvillages migrating for 2\u20133 months to work on construction sites and other nonagricultural wage labor opportunities.  \n \nPoverty in the state is estimated at 37.06%, significantly higher than India\u2019s average of 27.09%, with an estimated annual per \ncapita income of those living below the poverty line at Rs3889.32 (less than $90). The Project is expected to stimulate \neconomic growth and human development in the state. The survey findings indicate that 86.43% of the respondents \nconfirmed the need for the Project and perceive a positive linkage between poverty reduction and road improvement. \n \nThe households covered during the socioeconomic survey consider the perceived socioeconomic benefits of the Project in \nterms of improved access to socioeconomic services, increased employment opportunities, and improved means of transport \nservices as the major positive impact of the project construction that would in turn reduce poverty in the region. The \nhouseholds engaged in wage labor regard improved mobility as an opportunity that would provide them better paying jobs \noutside their villages. The communities also felt that the Project, by improving transport services, would possibly result in \ncheaper services, thereby benefiting those working outside the villages.   \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No \n \nIs there a participation strategy?       Yes    No \n \nConsultations and meetings with the various project communities were organized during the social survey to ascertain their \nresponse to road construction, the communities\u2019 needs and demands, an estimate of the communities\u2019 losses, and steps to \nmitigate them.  \n \nIn the case of the sample subproject, a number of focus group discussions were organized during the course of the social \n   ", "52   Appendix 12 \nappraisal. These discussions were held with men, women, farmers, indigenous people, scheduled castes, high income \ngroups, poor, shopkeepers, truckers, etc. to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the Project as well as its impacts. Other \nkey stakeholders such as panchayati raj members such as village sarpanch, village health workers, block development \nofficers, aanganwadi workers, auxiliary nurse midwives, and school teachers were consulted by means of key stakeholder \ndiscussions. These discussions and consultations undertaken confirmed the need for the Project with a positive response of \nthe community and different stakeholders toward the Project among all socioeconomic groups. The key benefits of the \nProject as voiced by the stakeholders will be in terms of augmented access to socioeconomic services.   \n \nMadhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation (MPRDC) will ensure that for additional subprojects, essential participation \nfocuses will be adhered to with the related stakeholders to enhance economic development and growth of the communities. \nThe perceptions and priorities of the stakeholders will be considered while finalizing project design and mitigation measures \nto address risks, if any.  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender participation was ensured during the course of the social study by undertaking gender analysis to assess the impact \nof the Project. Focus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different socioeconomic groups such as \nhigh income group, poor, scheduled tribe women, and women belonging to scheduled castes, and other backward classes. \nThese discussions brought forth that the Project will provide benefits for both men and women and special benefits to women \nby increasing the opportunity among girls to access higher education, and access for women and children to improved local \nservices and higher levels of health care outside the village. Focus group discussions with the women of various castes and \ncommunities revealed that women of all castes want the construction of roads. \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No  \n \nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n        \nItem  Significant/    Plan Required \nNot Significant/  Strategy to Address Issues \nNone   \n    The Project has been developed with a view to avoid or   \n   Significant  minimize  the  need  for  land  acquisition  and  resulting   Full \nResettlement   Not significant  involuntary resettlement by  means of adopting the most   Short \nfeasible technical design.

Due  diligence  was \nundertaken based on preliminary designs and confirmed \nthat the sample subproject will not entail any involuntary \nresettlement and land acquisition impact.  \n \nA  resettlement  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  E) \nprepared for the additional subprojects, addresses adverse \nresettlement impacts on assets such as land, structures, \nand cultural assets.  \n \n    The rehabilitation of the existing roads will reduce transport   \n   Significant  costs and increase the mobility of the local population in the   Yes \nAffordability   Not significant  project areas.
