The additional financing of the Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project consolidates the \nachievements  of  the  current  project,1 and  thereby  will  increase  its  impact  with  regard  to \nsafeguarding the unique cultural and economic values of the Bagmati River. \n2.  Under the current project, government institutions in charge of basin management were \nstrengthened and better aligned with the new federal state constitution of September 2015. Civil \nsociety  organizations  were  established  and  have  become  active  stakeholders  in  basin \nmanagement. River beautification works have used nature-based solutions and given residents \nrenewed appreciation of the Bagmati River. However, these beautification works cover only about \nhalf of the urban area, and expansion would significantly increase the impact of the works, while \nalso incorporating the culturally most significant portion of the river, which has cultural heritage \nbuildings that were severely damaged during the 2015 earthquakes. River water availability will \nincrease through completion of the Dhap dam under the current project, which will allow targeted \nreleases of water during the dry season, but additional work is required to capture and treat to a \nhigh standard contaminated water for reuse in the main river branch. A flood forecasting and early \nwarning system has been developed, but more training is needed in its use, and the system needs \nto be better anchored with institutions in charge of flood protection. \n3.  The additional financing will focus on (i) consolidating of water management institutions, \nincluding civil society platforms; (ii) expanding river beautification, including the cultural value of \nthe riverine environment; (iii) improving water availability during the dry season; and (iv) improving \nand consolidating the flood forecasting and early warning system. \n4.  The additional financing is estimated to cost $78.8 million. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is requested to finance $63.0 million while the government will finance the remaining $15.8 \nmillion. The proposed associated transaction technical assistance (TA) will be financed through \na grant of $0.60 million. The additional financing and this TA are included in the ADB country \noperation business plan, 2019\u20132021.2 \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n5.  The TA will support capacity building of the Bagmati River basin water management \ninstitutions  and  focus  on  information  technology  (IT)  applications  that  can  support  basin \nmanagement and strengthen decision making. These IT applications were partially developed \nunder the current project, but are incomplete and lack full connectivity and networking; in addition, \nfurther evolution of basin management policies require adaptation of the information exchange. \nThe capacity development is proposed in an associated TA because the tasks are specialized \nand require specific consultant skills; targeted, concentrated specialist inputs; and a well-installed \nIT system and network. A well-established operation and maintenance procedure for the IT \nsystem needs to be developed and tested for continued smooth operation after project completion. \nEstablishing such a system requires demonstrated successful experience with comparable tasks. \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank.
