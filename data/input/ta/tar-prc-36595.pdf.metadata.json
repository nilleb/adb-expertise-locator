INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to help the \nHefei municipal government (HMG) prepare the Hefei Urban Environment Improvement Project.  \nThe  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the  project  area  in  May  2005;  held  discussions  with  the \nMinistry of Finance, Anhui provincial government (APG), HMG, and other stakeholders; and \nprepared the detailed objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation \narrangements for the TA, which is listed in ADB\u2019s country program for 2005.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rapid urbanization in the PRC not only has taken its toll on the environment but has also \nchallenged the capacity of local governments to promote good urban governance, including the \nsustainable financing and timely delivery of public services.  While some progress has been \nmade  in  building  urban  infrastructure  over  the  past  two  decades,  such  supply  has  been \noutstripped  by  the  increased  pressure  arising  from  rapid  industrial  growth  and  increased \nmigration to urban centers as the Government continues to promote urbanization to develop \nmarkets and create jobs. Consequently, major cities and towns are characterized by widespread \nindustrial and vehicular air pollution, discharge of untreated wastewater into rivers and lakes, \nshortage  of  safe  drinking  water  supply,  and  improper  handling  of  solid  waste,  including \nhazardous  waste.  Major  cities  and  towns,  such  as  Hefei,  urgently  need  to  address  the \nincreasing demand for urban infrastructure to meet the anticipated rural\u2013urban migration and \nfurther economic expansion, and to avoid further environmental degradation. \n \n3.  Hefei, capital of Anhui province, also serves as the commercial and industrial center of \nthis inland province. With a total population of about 4.5 million, Hefei municipality includes four \nurban districts and three counties spread over 7,498 square kilometers (km2).2 Since 2000, the \neconomy of Hefei has been growing at an annual average rate of 13.2%. The rapid economic \ngrowth, industrialization, and urbanization have led to discharge of large amounts of untreated \nor inadequately treated wastewater, improper disposal of solid wastes and hazardous wastes, \nand high air pollution. Untreated wastewater is discharged into the city rivers including the \nNanfei River and the Shiwuli River, which flow southeasterly into the northern catchment area of \nChao Lake, one of Hefei\u2019s water sources, in central Anhui.3 Access to clean water supply has \nalso been endangered with the deteriorating water quality of Chao Lake, threatening the health \nand living conditions of the residents. \n \n4.  Currently, wastewater discharge in Hefei is estimated at 595,000 cubic meters (m3) per \nday in the four urban built-up district areas. The three existing wastewater treatment plants \n(WWTPs) have a total capacity of 435,000 m3/day including the ADB-financed Wangxiaoying \nWWTP Phase II with a capacity of 150,000 m3/day. However, the existing sewer networks in \neach of the WWTPs\u2019 service areas are inadequate to fully utilize the wastewater treatment \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 7 April 2004. \n2  The population in the four urban districts is 1.60 million, including an estimated floating population or nonregistered \npermanent residents of about 0.35 million. \n3  In 1996, ADB provided two loans to improve Chao Lake: ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors on Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Anhui Environmental \nImprovement Project for Municipal Wastewater Treatment: Manila (Loan 1490) and ADB. 1996. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor the Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Industrial Pollution Abatement. Manila (Loan 1491). The \nWangxiaoying wastewater treatment plant was constructed in Hefei under Loan 1490.  \n ", "2   \ncapacity.  In  the  new  southern  urban  development  area,  there  is  still  no  WWTP  to  treat \nwastewater before this is discharged into Shiwuli River. In total, the wastewater treatment rate in \nHefei is about 50%, with the remaining untreated wastewater discharged into the river system \nthat eventually feeds into Chao Lake. As a consequence, the water quality of Ershibu River, Sili \nRiver, Shiwuli River, and Nanfei River generally does not meet class V of the National Water \nQuality Standard.4 Untreated wastewater from these rivers has been causing severe pollution of \nChao Lake, underscoring the need for Hefei  to strengthen its wastewater management and \nprotect its water resources. In addition, there is an urgent need to reduce flood damage along \nthese rivers in the urban built-up areas,  particularly in the Hefei section of the Chao Lake basin, \nwhich is primarily an agricultural area.  \n \n5.  HMG is addressing the need to install an advanced and efficient system for managing \nmedical  and  hazardous  solid  wastes,  particularly  in  the  light  of  the  recent  outbreak  of \ncommunicable diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome. Currently, about 71,400 \ntons of medical and hazardous industrial solid wastes are generated annually in Anhui, with \nmuch of it coming from Hefei. However, only 13,800 tons, or about 19%, are treated annually. \nThe province has no medical waste treatment center. Overall the treatment requirement and \nstandards for hazardous solid waste have not yet been met by the dispersed treatment facilities. \nCentralized  treatment  facilities  with  internationally  advanced  technology  and  strengthened \nmanagement are urgently required in the province. A former landfill site northwest of the city is \nalso in danger of contaminating the river system during the rainy season.  Improper handling of \nsolid waste, including hazardous and medical waste, continues to pose a serious threat to public \nhealth and the environment. \n \n6.  The  present  urban  transport  infrastructure  and  services  in  Hefei  cannot  meet  the \nincreasing traffic demand. The incomplete road network, low infrastructure standard, low flow \ncapacity at surface intersections, and slow vehicle speed all contribute to traffic congestion, \ntraffic accidents, and vehicle emissions. Road density in Hefei is relatively low; equivalent to \n2.18 km per km2 of land, lower than the national urban roads and transportation planning \nindicators: 5.3\u20137 km per km2 of land. The number of registered vehicles has also been growing \nin Hefei, reflecting the national trend. As new areas are developed outside the old built-up \ndistricts to decongest the city center, the existing road network needs to be strengthened. The \npresent road network, including trunk roads, secondary roads, and tertiary roads, has not been \ndeveloped as envisaged. Hefei has a limited high- standard trunk road.  \n \n7.  Aware  of  the  environmental  degradation  caused  by  rapid  urbanization,  HMG  is \nembarking on a multisector environment protection program to meet national environmental \nguidelines and to ensure Hefei\u2019s sustainable economic growth. Generally, government policies \nrequire that urban environmental pollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010. Major \ncities, such as provincial capitals, should attain a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2010.  \nAPG also aims to restore the average water quality in Chao Lake, one of three PRC lakes \ndesignated for priority environmental protection, from Class V to Class III at all control points \nthroughout the lake by 2010. This implies that the water quality of the river system that feeds \ninto Chao Lake should also be improved and maintained at Class III. Sustainable development \n                                                 \n4 The Environmental Quality Standards of the People\u2019s Republic of China have five classes for surface water quality \nbased on use: Class I: the water comes from the source of a river or stream or flows through a national nature \nreserve and is acceptable for any use; Class II: the water can be used for municipal drinking water supply in a \nconservation area for rare aquatic species or fish spawning; Class III: once treated, the water can be used for \nmunicipal drinking water in a conservation area for ordinary aquatic species, and for swimming; Class IV: the water \ncan be used for industrial water supply and recreation other than swimming; and Class V: the water can be used \nonly for industrial cooling water, irrigation, and ordinary landscaping. \n ", "  3\nalso requires that Hefei strengthen its capacities, not only to manage wastewater, solid wastes \nand urban road network but also formulate more integrated and coherent urban planning, and \nmonitor  and  enforce  environmental  compliance.  HMG  is  adopting  a  more  comprehensive \napproach toward improving its urban environment. With support from APG, HMG has identified \na priority list of investment projects totaling $430 million, of which $150 million is proposed for \nADB financing. The subprojects are grouped into four components: (i) urban water resource \nmanagement and pollution control (rehabilitation of Ershipu, Banqiaohe, and Silihe rivers and \nChao Lake flood control and ecological improvement); (ii) wastewater management and water \nsupply (construction of three WWTPs, expansion of the urban sewer network, and construction \nof Dafangying water plant); (iii) solid waste management and ecological improvement (medical \nand hazardous waste disposal center, former landfill site enhancement, and pollution control); \nand (iv) northeast district road infrastructure development (expansion of urban roads and traffic \nmanagement). In this connection, a TA has been requested to help prepare a multisector urban \ninfrastructure  development  project  that  will  help  Hefei  improve  its  urban  environment  and \nachieve long-term sustainable development. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy \nand  will  help  the  PRC  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  of  environmental \nsustainability and increased access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. In addition, the \nTA will formulate an institutional development component focusing on project implementation, \nurban planning techniques, environment monitoring and enforcement, water quality monitoring, \nroad safety and traffic management, and financial management. \n \n8.  The proposed Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic objectives to make markets \nwork  more  efficiently  through  infrastructure  development  and  to  promote  environmental \nsustainability in the PRC. Over the past decade, ADB has stepped up its involvement in urban \ndevelopment  and  water  resource  management  in  the  PRC  through  its  lending  and  TA \noperations. The knowledge gained from similar investment projects in such urban centers as \nShanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Fuzhou and that generated from various policy-oriented studies \nhave been incorporated in the design of the requested TA, which is packaging multisector \nintervention measures aimed at urban environment improvement. This will be the first ADB-\nfinanced urban development project in which the quality of urban life will be improved through \nurban transport development and its associated software aspects of road safety and vehicular \nemission  reduction  alongside  the  traditional  investment  projects  aimed  at  strengthening \nwastewater and solid waste management. The Project will also complement two successful \nADB-financed projects aimed at arresting the deteriorating water quality of Chao Lake (footnote \n3). The two projects give important lessons for successful project implementation: (i) strong \ncommitment of local governments in ensuring the availability of counterpart funding, (ii) adoption \nof cost recovery measures including tariff reforms, (iii) extensive training, and (iv) establishment \nof a full-time and adequately resourced project management office (PMO) to ensure efficient \ncoordination  of  the  multiple  project  components.  Experience  from  this  Project  will  provide \nvaluable lessons for the PRC and ADB in designing future projects to address the adverse \nimpact of rapid urbanization on the environment.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will prepare an investment project based on an assessment of the various urban \ninfrastructure subprojects that will collectively improve the physical urban environment of Hefei \nand the quality of life of its residents. The Project will (i) enhance the quality of its water \nresources,  (ii)  strengthen  its  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  (iii)  reduce  the  \n ", "4   \noccurrence of flooding in Chao Lake, and (iv) improve urban air quality through a more efficient \ncity road network and reduced vehicular emission. The project design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Initially, the TA will conduct a situation analysis of Hefei\u2019s urban development and its \nfuture directions in the context of PRC\u2019s urbanization strategy and Hefei\u2019s role as the growth \ncenter of Anhui Province and the surrounding areas. This key activity will involve a review of \nHefei\u2019s master or long-term urban development plan and interviews  with concerned policy \nmakers and planning officials. The TA will identify Hefei\u2019s sector and investment priorities and \nuse them as the basis to determine the adequacy of the list of proposed subprojects and any \nshortcomings in achieving the urban development objectives of Hefei. The TA will then review \nand  assess  the  feasibility  of  the  selected  subprojects  based  on  technical,  institutional, \nenvironmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant factors. The TA will also design \nan institutional development component based on an assessment of the needs of HMG and \nfinancial  management  of  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  of  the  various  subprojects.  In \nformulating an overall project proposal for financing, the TA will follow ADB\u2019s guidelines in \naddressing environmental and poverty and social issues pertaining to resettlement, gender, and \nindigenous peoples. Household surveys will be conducted to address such issues as public \nawareness and affordability. Consultation workshops and tripartite meetings will be scheduled \nstrategically during TA implementation, which will also identify the stakeholders and develop a \nparticipatory approach to the design of the Project.  The initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n11.  Major risks to the successful implementation of the TA include (i) inadequate counterpart \nsupport and performance, (ii) lack of adequate and timely provision of necessary data, (iii) delay \nin  submitting  required  studies,  (iv)  delay  in  appointing  and  mobilizing  consultants,  and  (v) \ninadequate performance of the consultants. Efforts will be made to ensure that competent \nconsultants are recruited on time and their performance checked out regularly. The Government \nhas agreed to provide adequate counterpart support, make all necessary data available when \nrequired, and undertake and update all required studies according to a timetable agreed upon \nwith ADB. Close coordination among the consultants, executing agencies, IAs, and ADB will \nfurther mitigate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent, comprising $489,000 in \nforeign exchange and $461,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nthat ADB finance $750,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $261,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government has agreed to provide the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent  to  $200,000  for  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  furniture,  administrative  support \nservices, and logistics. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  HMG will be the Executing Agency  of the TA. The Anhui Provincial Finance Bureau, \nwhich has had experience in implementing projects financed by ADB and the World Bank, will \n ", "  5\nprovide overall guidance. HMG has established a steering committee, chaired by a vice mayor, \nwith senior officials as members from Hefei Development and Planning Commission (HDPC), \nHefei  Finance  Bureau,  Hefei  Construction  Bureau,  Hefei  Environmental  Protection  Bureau \n(HEPB),  Hefei  Water  Affairs  Bureau,  Hefei  New  Station  Pilot  District,  and  Hefei  Urban \nInvestment Company. A PMO has been established and will report to the steering committee. A \nvice director of HDPC will head the PMO to maintain interdepartmental coordination and ensure \nthe study team\u2019s access to relevant information and data, and to liaise with ADB on matters \nrelating to TA implementation. The Government has agreed to provide an adequate number of \nexperienced and qualified counterpart staff to work with the consultants on a full-time basis. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months from November 2005 to May 2006. The TA \nwill require about 55 person-months of consulting services: 18 of international and 37 domestic. \nThe  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  water  resource  management  including \nwastewater  treatment,  water  supply  and  flood  control,  solid  waste  management,  urban \ntransport, financial and economic analyses, institutional and regulatory development, social \nanalysis,  resettlement,  and  the  environment.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  expertise \nsimilar to that of the international consultants. An international consulting firm, in association \nwith domestic consultants, will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants. ADB will  select and engage consultants following the  quality- and cost-based \nselection method, using simplified technical proposal procedures. The outline terms of reference \nfor the consulting services are in Appendix 4.  \n \n15.  The PMO will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication \naccess, transport for consultants, materials, maps, data, and documents required by the TA, \nand will cover the cost of utilities for the use of consultants, counterpart professional staff, and \nsupport  staff.  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement and transferred to HMG upon the completion of the TA.  \n \n16.  The consultants will prepare TA inception, interim, draft final, and final reports. On the \nbasis of the government reports, the consultants will prepare summary and full environmental \nimpact assessments and resettlement reports in English for submission to ADB.  Study findings \nwill be presented in workshops, which will be attended by members of the steering committee, \nADB, and other stakeholders.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Hefei Urban Environment \nImprovement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Mechanism  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved urban  Water quality of the city  Monitoring reports of the  \u2022  Project design is \nenvironment and  river system is  Hefei Environmental  implemented effectively. \nenhanced quality of life  improved to Class IV.
