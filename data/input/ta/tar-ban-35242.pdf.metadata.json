During the 2003 Country Program Confirmation Mission of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the Government of Bangladesh (the Government) renewed its request that ADB provide \nassistance for developing its gas sector. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh from \n28 to 31 January 2004 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, \nscope, cost, financing, implementation arrangements, and the consultant\u2019s outline terms of \nreference. This Technical Assistance (TA)1 is designed to assist the Government to prepare for \nthe proposed Gas Sector  Development Project (the Project). The Project is a standby loan \nincluded in the 2004 country program.2  \n \n2.    The Government has proposed several investments for ADB financing under the Project. \nThese have been selected from components in the gas sector master plan (2003\u20132020) of the \nBangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla). The projects comprise the most \nurgent  components  of  the  plan\u2019s  priority  investment  program.  Although  preparatory  work \n(technical and economic feasibility and environmental, social, and poverty impact analysis) of \nthese investment components is under way, substantial additional work still is needed.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Noncommercial energy, mostly biomass, accounts for about two-thirds of total energy \nconsumption in Bangladesh. Natural gas accounts for almost 70% of commercial energy. It also \nprovides  the  basis  for  about  90%  of  electricity  generation.  In  2000\u20132001,  natural  gas \nconsumption by various consumer categories was: 49% by electricity generation; 20% by the \nfertilizer industry; 13.6% by other industries; 9.4% by domestic use; 1.1% for commercial use \nand losses accounted for 6.9%. The share of oil in the total energy mix has declined, and the \nuse of natural gas has increased.  \n \n4.  Natural gas will provide most of the current and future energy requirements, and the gas \nmarket needs to be expanded to optimize the use of natural gas resources and support \neconomic development. Although Bangladesh has been producing natural gas for over three \ndecades,  all  its  major  fields  are  underdeveloped  and  have  not  been  properly  delineated. \nAssessments  of  the  country\u2019s  natural  gas  resource  potential  vary  widely.  Total  proven \nrecoverable gas reserves in Bangladesh from 22 fields (18 in the public sector and 4 in the \nprivate sector) are estimated at 20.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which 5.09 TCF has so far been \nconsumed. The current net recoverable reserve stands at 15.3 TCF. However, substantial \nnatural gas reserves remain underdeveloped or undiscovered.  \n \n5.  The  natural  gas  sector  consists  of  Petrobangla  and  its  11  subsidiaries  operating \ncompanies (gas sector entities). Petrobangla is mandated to carry out oil and natural gas \nexploration, and the production and marketing of gas. The Ministry of Power, Energy and \nMineral Resources (MEMR) oversees gas, mineral, petroleum, and power sectors in policy, \nregulatory, and operational matters.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in  ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 January 2004. Vice-President \n(Operations 1) cleared the TA concept paper on 18 March 2004. \n2  A $170 million loan project was included in the 2000 country program but did not materialize.   \n3  Components for the proposed loan project will be selected considering their poverty reduction impact from making \nclean energy available to less developed areas, evidence of strong support from the local population, and a high \nlikelihood of success.  \n ", "2  \n6.  The domestic gas price structure is established by the Government by setting the gas \nsales prices for different consumer categories. The Government also determines the level of \ntaxes and the distribution margins for gas transmission and distribution companies. The gas \nproduction companies receive a price that is equivalent to the sales price of gas paid by end-\nusers less the distribution margin for the transmission and distribution companies and the taxes \nlevied by the Government. \n \n7.  Natural gas in Bangladesh remains underpriced in relation to the long-run marginal cost. \nThis has led to significant resource transfer by some sectors and consumer groups. The \naverage tariff for all users was 78% of total sales in 1999/2000, implying an average subsidy of \n22%. The underpricing of domestic gas use leads to a high opportunity cost in terms of foregone \nresources that could have been mobilized to support investment within and outside the sector, \nespecially given the country\u2019s massive development financing needs. Performance in the gas \nsector has also been limited; it is well below the potential because of low gas extraction and \nlimited use by the domestic market. The delayed or inadequate investment in the expansion of \nthe  gas  production,  transmission,  and  distribution  networks  and  their  operation  and \nmaintenance are also major concerns in the sector. This has limited the market and constrained \nPetrobangla\u2019s gas production, causing supply shortages and disrupting fertilizer production and \npower generation.  \n \n8.  ADB has had a long involvement in the energy sector of Bangladesh. ADB has been \ninvolved in the gas sector intermittently over the last 25 years, with eight loans totaling $446 \nmillion. As in other countries, ADB\u2019s role has evolved from provider of funds for individual \nproducts to a more proactive and comprehensive one involving technical advice for project \npreparation and policy advice in implementing sector reforms. Overall macroeconomic stability \nand policy issues have a significant bearing on the sector\u2019s performance and, more importantly, \nits ability to reform. Delegation of authority from the Government to the management of sector \nentities and from the management to the staff has been limited. Nevertheless, the Government \nrecognizes the need to introduce gradual reforms aimed at commercialization of the sector and \ndistancing operations, regulations, and policy making from each other.  \n \n9.  Of  two  active  gas  sector  loans,  the  Third  Natural  Gas  Development  Project4  was \ncompleted in October 2003, more than 4 years behind schedule due to procurement delays. \nThe Dhaka Clean Fuel Project has just been declared effective 1 year after loan approval.5 The \nimplementation of all previous power and gas sector projects has usually been delayed; thus, \nADB\u2019s portfolio management in these sectors could have been more effective. No major loan \ncancellations have been made, although loan funds have been reallocated. ADB provided TA to \nprepare the Fourth Natural Gas Development Project6 but TA did not lead to a loan project. The \nFourth Natural Gas Development Project would have supported a gas transmission pipeline \nfrom the Jamuna Bridge to Bangladesh\u2019s border with India. However, the export of gas from \nBangladesh to India has not yet been agreed upon. To the extent relevant, consultants working \non the current TA will refer to work previously done, including for the Fourth Natural Gas \nDevelopment Project. \n \n10.  Several major initiatives were taken under the Third Natural Gas Development Project, \nincluding the establishment of the Hydrocarbon Unit in the Ministry of Power, Energy and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1993.

The adoption in October 2003 (after project completion) of a gas pricing \nframework linked to international fuel oil prices largely comprises compliance with the related \ncovenant. Other major policy covenants, particularly those relating to autonomy of the gas \nsector entities, have been partly complied with. The covenant relating to partial private sector \nownership in each of the gas production, transmission, and distribution companies that were \nexecuting agencies under the loan project is irrelevant to the current reform process since it \nwould not lead to significant change in the sector or the companies. Further, in retrospect, it \nappears that the condition was premature in the absence of a legal framework enabling private \nsector  participation  in  gas  transmission  and  distribution.  Regulatory,  policy, and capacity \nstrengthening measures to address the issues encountered in implementing the Third Natural \nGas Development Project will be pursued under the Dhaka Clean Fuel Project7 and the others \nwill  form  the  basis  of  policy  dialogue  under  the  proposed  Project.  ADB\u2019s  TA  support  in \nconjunction with the Third Natural Gas Development Project subsequently helped the drafting of \nthe regulatory framework and key regulations that led to the creation of the Energy Regulatory \nCommission.8  \n \n11.  Pursuant to policy dialogue with ADB and development partners, the Government has \ntaken steps to move away from administered gas tariffs to a flexible and transparent mechanism \nunder which gas prices will be linked to the cost of supply for each category of consumer and \nadjusted  periodically.  As  a  first  step  toward  commercializing  gas  sector  operations,  the \nGovernment in October 2003 adopted an interim pricing framework for electricity, gas, and \npetroleum products that would help provide policy guidelines to the new regulator. The new \npricing framework has been designed to enable the sector to cover its operating expenses and \ndebt-servicing liabilities, and generate a surplus to finance part of its investment program, rather \nthan  relying  on  the  Government  budget.  The  pricing  framework  will  allow  formula-based \nfrequent tariff adjustments in line with international market prices. Prices of petroleum products \nwill be based on import parity prices, the price of gas will be linked with the international high \nsulfur fuel oil, and power tariffs will reflect movements in gas or fuel oil prices and other variable \ncosts. The prices for power will be reviewed quarterly; those for gas and petroleum will be \nreviewed monthly. Price adjustments will normally be made semi-annually.  However,  more \nfrequent adjustments will be made if necessitated by international price movements and other \neconomic factors and if the monthly variation exceeds 10%. Any subsidy, such as that for \nfertilizer, will be made transparent and provided through budgetary provisions.  \n \n12.  The Government is preparing a 3-year plan for gas sector reform outlining its vision on \nrestructuring,  ownership,  private  sector  participation,  and  regulation.  The  Government \nrecognizes  that  an  improved  gas  sector  could  have  a  large  potential contribution to the \ndevelopment of the economy, but it would have to be effectively managed to maximize its role in \npoverty reduction and ensure an equitable distribution of benefits. Priority elements include (i) \nensuring  good  governance  in  the  gas  sector  entities,  including  facilitating  private  sector \nparticipation; (ii) designing and implementing competitive and equitable pricing policies; (iii) \nstrengthening and improving commercial operations; (iv) enacting laws to strengthen the legal \nframework to enable effective private sector participation, and defining the sector restructuring \nprogram; (v) implementing an action program to improve the financial performance of gas sector \nentities; (vi) developing human resources; and (vii) strengthening the institutional capability in \npolicy making and monitoring. During the discussions, the Government stated that the ERC \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2002.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n13.   The TA will help the Government prepare a gas sector development project. The Project \nwill include (i) a sector development plan, (ii) policy reform measures, (iii) priority investments, \nand (iv) an institutional strengthening component. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will investigate the necessary sector reform requirements and alternatives to \nmeet the projected gas demand especially in less developed  areas of the country. This will \ninvolve  (i)  reviewing  the  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  sector  development  plans  and \npreparing  a  policy  package;  (ii)  reviewing  infrastructure  development  proposals  and  other \ndocuments to define the scope of the components for financing under the ensuing Project; (iii) \nmaking a technical review of the proposals to confirm their suitability and soundness and \npreparing implementation schedules for the selected components; and (iv) undertaking financial, \neconomic, environmental, social, poverty reduction, and institutional analyses of  the investment \nfeasibility  studies  prepared  by  the  Government.  The  TA  will  also  develop  an  institutional \nstrengthening plan for Petrobangla and other relevant agencies. \n \n15.  Key activities include  \n \n(i)  preparing an internal report that analyzes the potential for economic growth and \nsocial  development  in  less  developed  areas,  particularly  with  reference  to \nexpanding natural gas supply and distribution;  \n(ii)  preparing a report that analyzes the potential and required reforms for gas sector \ndevelopment;  \n(iii)  preparing a report that assesses barriers to improving gas sector development;  \n(iv)  identifying policy packages for the promotion of gas sector development;  \n(v)  developing  an  investment  package  that  identifies  infrastructure  development \ncomponents;  \n(vi)  performing detailed financial, economic, environmental, social, poverty reduction, \nand institutional analyses of the identified project components;  \n(vii)  reviewing  the  Project\u2019s  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  procurement \npackages, and  \n(viii)  estimating the levels that greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by the \nsubprojects. \n \n16.  No major risks are associated with the TA, and the Government has expressed its strong \nsupport for the TA. Appendix 2 summarizes the initial social and poverty analysis of the Project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, comprising $305,000 in \nforeign exchange and $295,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The amount of $480,000, of \nwhich $305,000 is in foreign exchange and $175,000 equivalent is in local currency cost, will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the ", "  5\nremaining $120,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The detailed cost estimates are presented \nin Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be Petrobangla, which will appoint a senior staff \nmember as the Project director. The TA will finance the services of international and domestic \nconsultants. The TA will be carried out for 4 months by an internationally recognized consulting \nfirm in association with domestic consultants. The TA will commence in late June 2004 and will \nbe completed by the end of October 2004. The consultants for the TA will be recruited by ADB \non the basis of submission of simplified technical proposals and using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedure. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. International consultants will procure the equipment to be \nfinanced under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, through direct \npurchase procedures with quotations from at least three suppliers. A project management office \n(PMO) will be established in Petrobangla. The PMO will be responsible for the day-to-day \nmanagement  of  the  TA  and  will  coordinate  with  all  government  and  nongovernment \nstakeholders of the proposed Project. The PMO will also oversee consultants\u2019 activities and \nfacilitate all ADB\u2019s TA administration and loan project processing activities.  \n \n19.  International consultants will be engaged for a total of 8 person-months, and domestic \nconsultants for 21 person-months. The consulting team will comprise international experts in (i) \ngas sector development, (ii) natural gas economics, and (iii) financial analysis. The domestic \nexperts will include (i) an institutional development specialist, (ii) an environment specialist, (iii) \na social development specialist, (iv) a poverty reduction specialist, (v) a financial analyst, (vi) a \nnatural gas economist, and (vii) a natural gas policy specialist. The outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n20.  The consultants will submit an inception report 2 weeks after TA commencement and a \ndraft final report 3 months later. The Government and ADB will provide comments and they will \nbe discussed at tripartite meetings. At the end of 4 months, the consultants will submit the final \nreport incorporating Government and ADB comments on the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.
