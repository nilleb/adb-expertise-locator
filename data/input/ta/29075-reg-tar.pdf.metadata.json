INTRODUCTION\n1. Significant attention is being directed toward the role of non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs) in development. In Asia particularly, NGOs are growing in number, size, scope of\noperations, sophistication and degree of impact. However, despite their expanding importance\nin development, complete and consistent information about NGOs generally is not available. As\nwell, little meaningful analysis of NGO sectors or NGO operations exists. For the Bank, this lack\nof complete, accessible, relevant information and analysis regarding NGOs and their scope of\noperations poses a significant constraint as the Bank expands its cooperation with NGOs.\n2. This regional technical assistance (TA) will cover NGOs in nine Asian developing member\ncountries (DMCs)1. The TA will develop a comprehensive, consistent NGO information base\nrelevant to the Bank's operations. Analysis to be undertaken will examine individual NGO\nsectors in the countries to be covered as well as compare NGO sectors across the region and\ndevelop a regional overview. The TA will develop recommendations, staff guidelines and \"best\npractices\" relating to how the Bank's cooperation with NGOs can be most effective. A regional\nworkshop will address selected aspects of the Bank's cooperation with NGOs and\nBank/NGO/government developmental partnerships.\n3. The TA refers to developmental NGOs: Groups and institutions independent of\ngovernment, characterized by humanitarian or cooperative objectives and with involvement in\nareas such as poverty reduction, improving welfare and quality of life, protecting and improving\nthe environment, and pursuit of social development and other social interests.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. NGOs are making increasingly effective contributions in all aspects of development.\nNGOs operate at local, national, regional and international levels, often through networks that\nexpand their effectiveness. NGOs possess a capacity and a commitment that allows them to\noccupy key positions in development, both independently and in partnership with governments,\ndevelopment institutions and donors.\n5. NGOs often pursue alternate solutions to the problems of development. NGO strategies\nfrequently reflect bottom-up perspectives that emphasize approaches designed to empower the\npoor and disadvantaged. In many cases, NGOs display comparative advantages in identifying\nand addressing constraints that prevent certain groups and levels of society from participating\nequally in development.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 1995 as Non-Governmental Organizations in\nDMCs.\"", "2\n6. NGOs hold a complementary yet necessary role in development and socioeconomic\ntransformation. As the role of government in development in many countries diminishes, the\ndevelopmental role of NGOs is becoming more important. In some countries, particulaily in\nSouth Asia, NGOs are being called upon by governments to participate directly in development\nprograms. NGOs often are more able than the private sector to meet needs that are emerging.\n7. While having strengths, however, NGOs also have weaknesses and limitations. As well,\nthe legitimacy, mandate and accountability of NGOs sometimes are questioned. Questions\nabout NGO weaknesses, limitations, legitimacy and responsibility also must be addressed in\nconsidering the role of NGOs in development.\n8. Cooperation between the Bank and NGOs is consistent with the Bank's role and functions\nas set out in Article 2(i) and 2(v) of the Charter. The 1987 policy paper  The Bank's Cooperation\nwith Non-Governmental Organizations (R79-87) establishes a framework for Bank/NGO\ncooperation. The Bank's current practice recognizes the comparative advantages and unique\nrole and abilities of NGOs, especially in relation to the Bank's objectives of strengthening the\nresponsiveness, effectiveness and sustainability of its development activities. Current practice\nreflects an objective of establishing closer operational ties with NGOs.\n9. Cooperation with NGOs has been identified as a key social process in the Bank pursuing\nthe strategic development objectives set out in the Bank's Medium-Term Strategic Framework.\nAs Bank operations address the social sectors and social sector issues, closer cooperation with\nNGOs can make Bank activities more efficient and effective, operationally and cost-wise.\n10. Comprehensive, current information about NGO operations in DMCs is not available in\na useful, convenient form. While information about NGOs has been compiled by other\ndevelopment institutions and by NGOs themselves, much of this information is outdated,\nincomplete, or inconsistent. Little meaningful or useful analysis of NGO operations exists. The\nlack of current, meaningful information and analysis about NGO operations is a severe constraint\nfor the Bank in identifying and developing activities and programs directed toward cooperation\nand collaboration with NGOs.\n11. The only Bank study of NGOs was undertaken in 1988: Cooperation with NGOs in\nAgriculture/Rural Development (RETA 5285). Beyond the sectoral limitations of this study, much\nhas changed since 1988, in the Bank, in DMCs, and in the NGO sector, and in the\ncircumstances of development and the developmental roles the Bank, governments and NGOs\nplay. This TA will update the findings of the 1988 study and will broaden the scope to address\nthe entire range of activities and sectors in the Bank's current program.\n12. Information and analysis to emerge from the TA will be an important resource as the\nBank expands its cooperation with NGOs. Country-level work will survey and analyze individual\nNGO communities. Regional-level analysis will compare the varying country-specific\ncircumstances and develop a regional overview of NGOs. The TA will develop recommendations\nand identify \"best practices'1 relating to how the Bank, NGOs and DMC governments can work\ntogether effectively and productively. A set of staff guidelines for cooperation with NGOs will be\nproduced. A regional workshop will review issues that emerge.", "3\nIII THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objecthies\n13. The TA will survey and analyze NGOs in selected Asian DMCs and develop specific\nrecommendations as to how BankINGO cooperation can be made more effective. Country-level\nsurveys will reflect the differing natures of the NGO sectors in the DMCs to be covered and the\ndiffering country-level operational and policy environments in which NGOs operate. Regional-\nlevel analysis will develop an overview of NGOs that compares and contrasts country-level\ncircumstances and provides a base from which policy-level considerations can be addressed.\nFrom the regional-level analysis will come recommendations as to how the Bank can more\neffectively and beneficially cooperate with NGOs. A set of \"best practices\" and a set of staff\nguidelines will be developed. At the conclusion of the country- and regional-level work, a\nregional workshop involving the Bank, NGOs and governments will address selected issues that\nemerge from the study and selected aspects of Bank/NGO/government cooperation and\ncollaboration.\nB.\t Scope\n14.\t The TA will:\n1.\t On a country basis:\n(i) undertake a census/survey of the overall NGO sector;\n(ii) identify and describe operational areas/sectors in which NGOs have been most\nsuccessful and most effective, and why;\n(iii) identify operational and organizational strengths and weaknesses of NGOs;\n(iv) assess the policy environment in which the NGO sector operates and identify and\npolicy-related constraints that NGOs face;\n(v) survey NGO-related experiences of other multilateral and bilateral donors;\n(vi) identify and analyze a portfolio of NGOs active in the sectors in which the Bank\noperates, with which the Bank might develop operational relationships; and\n(vii) develop recommendations as to areas in which the Bank, NGOs and government\ncan work together most successfully.\n2.\t On a regional basis, based on country-level and other work:\n(I)\t synthesize a regional-level overview of the NGO sector, including country-level\ncomparative analysis of NGO sectors in the countries covered;\n(ii) develop recommendations as to how the Bank can best cooperate with NGOs,\nincluding a set of \"best practices\" relating to the Bank/NGO cooperation and a set\nof staff guidelines for cooperation and coordination with NGOs; and\n(iii) conduct a workshop involving the Bank, NGO representatives and government\nofficials, to address selected issues of the Bank's cooperation with NGOs and\nBank/NGO/government cooperation.", "15. Nine countries, selected on the basis of having NGO sectors of particular relevance to\nBank operations, will be covered under the TA: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam. Bangladesh,\nIndonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Sn Lanka have well-established NGO sectors that\nhold particular relevance for Bank operations and possibilities for expanded cooperation.\nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam have emerging NGO sectors that have potential relevance\nfor Bank operations, but about which little complete, current information or analysis is available.\n16. Experience from previous technical assistance with design and scope similar to the\npresent TA as well as information gathered during processing of the TA suggests there will be\nno difficulties in implementing the present TA as envisaged, in temis of the number of countries\nto be covered, the proposed scope, or the proposed implementation arrangements. Information\ngathered during fact-finding indicates that there are country-level consultants or institutions\ncapable of undertaking the country-level work envisaged under the TA.\n17. The Bank already holds information on several of the countries to be covered. For\nseveral countries, other institutions already have done work toward surveying and analyzing NGO\ncommunities. Already-existing work will be considered wherever possible, to avoid duplication\nof efforts and waste of resources. This existing work, however, has been undertaken for varying\npurposes, has employed varying methodologies, and is of varying quality. As such, not all\nexisting work would meet the Bank's needs in terms of providing information to establish a\nrelevant data base on NGOs.\nC.\t Cost Estimates\n18. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. This would cover (i) ten\nperson-months for international consulting services and three person-months each of local\nconsulting services for the nine countries to be covered under the TA; (ii) international and\ndomestic travel; (iii) an inception meeting involving the Bank, the international consultant and\ncountry-level consultants or research institutions; (iv) communications; (v) publication of regional-\nand country-level studies and analysis results; (vi) a regional workshop involving the Bank, NGOs\nand governments; and (vii) contingencies. Detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2.\nThe cost of the TA will be charged to the Bank-funded technical assistance program.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n19. The TA will be implemented over a period of ten months, to commence in the first quarter\nof 1996. The TA will be completed in January 1997. The Social Development Division of the\nOffice of Environment and Social Development will supervise the TA.\n20. An international consultant will be engaged for ten months to design, supervise and\nexecute the work under the TA. The consultant will have experience in social research and in\ninstitutional analysis relating to NGOs, and will have the capacity to design and implement work\nplanned under the TA. The international consultant will be team leader and will coordinate and\nsupervise country-level studies.", "21. In consultation with the Bank, the international consultant will identify and assist in the\nengagement of country-level consultants. Country-level consultants will be engaged by direct\nselection. Country-level consultants will be engaged for three months each (27 months total)\nto undertake work in their respective countries. Uke the international consultant, country-level\nconsultants will have experience in social research and institutional analysis related to NGOs.\n22. The TA will comprise three levels of work. The first level, to be undertaken by the\ninternational consultant, will include design of the overall study and country-level studies. The\nsecond level will be country-level studies, to be undertaken by country-level consultants,\ncoordinated and supervised by the international consultant. The third level will be regional\nanalysis, to be undertaken by the international consultant, and to include drafting of a regional\noverview report, along with sets of recommendations, \"best practices\" and staff guidelines for\ncooperation with NGOs. The third level of work will include a regional workshop.\n23. Design of the overall study will include the development of a conceptual framework, as\nwell as identification of methodologies and criteria for country-level surveys and evaluation of\nNGOs, and criteria for identifying and analyzing NGOs in each country that have relevance and\npotential for closer relationships with the Bank. The study design will include mechanisms for\nupdating information gathered at the country level. A working group of Bank staff from offices\nand departments with an interest in the Bank's cooperation with NGOs will be formed to provide\nguidance in the development of a conceptual framework and the identification of evaluation\ncriteria. Before country-level work is begun, an inception workshop involving the Bank, the\ninternational consultant and country-level consultants will be held to finalize the conceptual\nframework and the methodologies and evaluation criteria for country-level work, and to ensure\nthat country-level consultants understand the framework, methodologies and criteria.\n24. After country-level work has been completed, a regional workshop involving the Bank,\nNGOs and government officials will be held to address selected issues emerging from the\ncountry-level studies and the regional analysis, as well as selected issues relating to\nBank/NGO/government cooperation. Discussions to be undertaken in this workshop would help\ndefine issues related to cooperation with NGOs in Bank operations and would help identify future\ndirections in developmental partnerships involving the Bank, NGOs and governments.\n25. All country-level work will be implemented in consultation with the respective countries'\nnational planning agency and with line agencies relevant to NGO operations. All consultants will\nbe engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n26. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance on a grant basis in an amount not exceeding the equivalent\nof $600,000 for the purpose of A Study of Non-Governmental Organizations in Asian\nDeveloping Member Countries, and hereby reports his action to the Board.", "Appendix 1\nPage 1\nPROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA STUDY OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS\nIN ASIAN DEVELOPING MEMBER COUNTRIES\nCONSULTANTS' TERMS OF REFERENCE\nTo achieve the objectives and scope of work described for the proposed technical\nassistance, the consultants will accomplish the following tasks.\nA.\t International Consultant\nThe international consultant will undertake detailed design of the overall study and\nwork to be done at the country level.
