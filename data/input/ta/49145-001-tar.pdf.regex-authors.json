INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam has long been aware of the need to address climate \nchange impacts and develop infrastructure by effectively integrating climate change mitigation \nactions. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) is the government\u2019s \nfocal climate change agency. Since 2009, the MONRE has piloted programs for climate change \nmitigation,  participated  in  global  and  regional  climate  change  conferences,  and  accessed \nvarious  forms  of  climate  change  funding,  both  directly  and  through  international  financial \ninstitutions. \n \n2.  Since 2014, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been consulted on measures to \nstrengthen the capacity of the MONRE and other relevant government agencies to prepare and \nimplement more systematic infrastructure developments that integrate climate change mitigation \nactions. This has led to a proposal for a capacity development technical assistance (TA) to \nstrengthen and coordinate the capacity of the MONRE and other relevant government agencies \nin  measuring,  reporting,  and  verifying  climate  change  mitigation  actions,  including  the \ndevelopment of guidelines for developing, implementing, and managing such mitigation actions. \nThe proposed TA is expected to help the government achieve a low-carbon economy as the \nprimary  aim  of  sustainable  economic  development  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission \nreductions.  The  Clean  Technology  Fund  (CTF)  Trust  Fund  Committee  considered  grant \nfinancing for the proposed TA in its investment plan for Viet Nam and approved it on 6 August \n2015. The government has been closely involved in developing the TA and concurs with the TA \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s rapid economic growth has led to increasing energy consumption and GHG \nemissions. Its fast urbanization rate has contributed to the growth in the amount of passenger \ntraffic:2 it rose 5.8% per year from 1999 to 2008, and is expected to more than triple from 2008 \nto 2020. The increasing use of motorized transport will increase the country\u2019s dependence on \nfossil fuels. The increase in total energy use and a heavy dependence on fossil fuels indicate \nthat  national  GHG  emissions  will  triple  by  2030  from  226  million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide \nequivalent in 2010. Thus, economic growth brings with it significant climate change risks as well \nas land, water, and air pollution.3 \n \n4.  In 1994, Viet Nam ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nto keep the increase in average global atmospheric temperature since pre-industrial times from \nexceeding 2 degrees Celsius. The government formulated policies and strategies to respond to \nclimate change, including the National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change and the \nNational Strategy on Climate Change, and developed nationally appropriate mitigation actions. \nFurthermore,  the  government  took  steps  to  address  GHG  emissions  in  particular,  while \npromoting a low-carbon growth path. These steps\u2014which include the 2009 CTF Investment \nPlan, the 2011 National Climate Change Strategy, the 2012 Green Growth Strategy, and the \n2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Viet Nam\u2014identify transport and energy \nas priority sectors for GHG emission reductions and set forth well-defined targets. To further \nrespond to these policies, strategies, and plans through implementing environment-friendly and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 October 2015. \n2  Viet Nam\u2019s urbanization rate is one of the fastest in the world. At present, 27% of the country\u2019s population lives in \nurban areas, with this figure expected to increase to 45% by 2020 and to 50% by 2030. \n3  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "2   \nlow-carbon projects, the government needs to build institutional and technical capacity in areas \nsuch  as  formulating  mitigation  actions,  integrating  them  into  development  programs  and \ninfrastructure projects, and measuring, reporting, and verifying their effects.  \n \n5.  ADB has been helping the government address sustainable development issues. For \nexample, the completed TA for the National Target Program on Climate Change with a Focus \non Energy and Transport helped the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Transport \ndevelop  climate  change  action  plans  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  and  negative  impacts  on \ntransport and energy infrastructure. The action plans identified mitigation options and applied \nthem to three locations\u2014Ho Chi Minh, Da Nang, and Thanh Hoa Province\u2014as a pilot.4 \n \n6.  The TA for the Core Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors \nInitiative,  Phase  II  is  currently  developing  an  environment-friendly  economic  cooperation \nprogram across countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion, including Viet Nam. It is building \nclimate change mitigation capacity in these countries by (i) supporting the development of \nclimate  change  mitigation  programs  and  actions;  (ii)  piloting  institutional  and  financial \nmechanisms to deploy low-carbon technologies; and (iii) identifying gaps in carbon emission \nbaselines and existing measuring, reporting, and verification systems (MRVs).5  \n \n7.  The  completed  TA  for  Developing  the  Market  Readiness  Proposal  for  a  Domestic \nCarbon Market promoted a domestic carbon market and provided a platform for technical \ndiscussion  on  the  partnership  for  carbon  market  readiness  by  preparing  the  organizing \nframework and market readiness proposal, which details the country\u2019s plan for its proposed \nmarket-based instruments and market readiness components.6  \n \n8.  To promote GHG emission reduction, the MONRE, with assistance from ADB, the World \nBank, and the International Finance Corporation, has prepared investment projects under the \nCTF Investment Plan, for which CTF cofinancing amounting to $250 million was endorsed by \nthe CTF Trust Fund Committee in December 2009 and October 2013. The 2013 revised CTF \nInvestment  Plan  includes  (i) three transport  projects  promoting  low-carbon  public  transport \nservices while managing transport demand in urban areas; (ii) three energy sector projects \ncontributing  to  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy,  and  the  expansion  of  the  power \ntransmission network to meet the electricity demand with a reliable, environmentally sustainable \nsupply; and (iii) the proposed TA to monitor and evaluate the CTF projects.7  \n \n9.  The Climate Investment Funds require annual monitoring and reporting of approved CTF \nprojects  based  on  a  CTF  toolkit  that  provides  guidance  and  reporting  tools  for  the  core \nindicators.8 This allows the measuring of progress and the effectiveness of a mitigation action \n(i.e., how much a planned mitigation action progresses in terms of five core indicators, e.g., tons \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011.

The CTF Trust Fund Committee \nmandates  this  monitoring  and  reporting  to  justify  CTF  investments,  develop  a  strategy  to \nimprove the operation of CTF projects, and increase the scale of investments with positive \nfeedback. In doing so, it is imperative for project implementing agencies to establish baselines \nand implement and operate MRVs from project implementation to operation. The MONRE \nshould  also  compile  quality  data  by  requiring  the  implementing  agencies  to  report  to  the \nMONRE in compliance with the CTF annual monitoring and reporting requirement. However, \nmost implementing and relevant agencies have not been fully equipped with the required MRVs. \nIn addition, some ongoing CTF projects do not include the core indicators in their monitoring \nframeworks. Hence, the MONRE has asked ADB to help the agencies establish and implement \nMRVs and enhance their climate change mitigation capacity.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be the development of a low-carbon economy to protect and improve \nquality of life and guarantee national security and sustainable development. The outcome will be \nthe development of environment-friendly and low-carbon transport and energy projects. The \ntarget  will  be  the  number  of  climate  change  mitigation  projects  supported  by  international \nfinancial institutions in the transport and energy sectors increased by 25% by 2020. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Expected  outputs  include  (i)  the  development  and  strengthening  of  MRVs  for  CTF \nprojects, (ii) the establishment of transport and energy sector mitigation guidelines, and (iii) the \nenhancement and coordination of agencies\u2019 capacity in climate change mitigation.  \n \n12.  Output 1: Measuring, reporting, and verification systems for Clean Technology \nFund projects developed and strengthened. The TA will develop and strengthen MRVs for \napproved  and  future  CTF  projects  in  the  MONRE  and  relevant  agencies  responsible  for \nimplementing and supervising CTF projects, in compliance with the CTF mandatory reporting \nrequirements.9 This will allow the environment and sector agencies to identify the progress and \neffectiveness of a mitigation action. Moreover, the agencies will have an opportunity to consider \nimprovements in the implementation and operation of a mitigation action and seek a better \nstrategy  to  achieve  its  objective.  Robust  and  implementable  MRVs  will  be  developed  by \nreviewing current institutional settings, past and ongoing support from the government and \ndevelopment partners, and current practices in Viet Nam and neighboring countries as well as \nsimilar environments. Practices to be reviewed include CTF projects as well as those funded by \nother sources if applicable. The TA will (i) identify gaps in data collection, analysis, and reporting \nin terms of technical skills and knowledge, financing, and institutional arrangements; (ii) develop \na recommended MRV institutional plan identifying necessary technical skills and knowledge, \nfinancing, and institutional settings built on good practices; and (iii) help the environment and \nsector  agencies  implement  and  operate  robust  and  implementable  MRVs  and  establish \n                                                \n9 Sector agencies will include local governments (e.g., Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, Dang Nang), which are the \nexecutive agencies of ongoing and future large-scale climate change mitigation projects in the transport and energy \nsectors.  \n ", "4   \nbaselines  through  advisory  and  capacity  development  under  output  3  using  the  MRV \ninstitutional plan.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Transport and energy sector mitigation guidelines established. The TA \nwill establish mitigation guidelines for the environment and sector agencies involved in transport \nand energy programs and projects. The guidelines will be developed through the reviewing \nprocess under output 1, and will cover CTF projects as well as projects funded by other sources \nin Viet Nam, if applicable. The guidelines are meant to be followed by any agency in Viet Nam \nimplementing and managing mitigation actions. The guidelines will (i) include a list of mitigation \nactions derived from reviewing CTF projects and other mitigation programs in Viet Nam and \nother countries if applicable; (ii) describe necessary MRV institutional settings built on the \nrecommended MRV institutional plan; and (iii) recommend mechanisms and steps to integrate \neffective mitigation actions into ongoing and future CTF projects, as well as those funded by \nother sources in the transport and energy sectors, by utilizing the results of the analysis and \nverifying mitigation actions. The guidelines will be reviewed and updated through consultations \nwith relevant agencies to improve their quality based on users\u2019 feedback.    \n \n14.  Output  3:  Agencies\u2019  capacity  in  climate  change  mitigation  enhanced  and \ncoordinated. The TA will enhance the capacity of environment and sector agencies in climate \nchange mitigation and coordination through knowledge sharing and capacity development. A \ntraining program will be provided to focal point officers in agencies implementing mitigation \nactions, the MONRE, and other relevant agencies. In addition, the TA will contribute to the \ndomestic  and  international  dissemination  of  the  progress  and  achievements  of  CTF \nimplementation in Viet Nam through climate change conferences and meetings. The TA will \ndevelop a communications and knowledge management plan and media products on CTF \nactivities in Viet Nam for public and other relevant conferences and meetings.  \n \n15.  It is assumed that the government and international development partners will remain \ncommitted  to  climate  change  mitigation.  Short-term  development  driven  by  rapid  industrial \ngrowth and urbanization may cause the government to address imminent problems promptly \ninstead of naming long-term sustainable development priorities. Although the government is \ncommitted  to  climate  change  mitigation  through  environment-friendly  infrastructure,  limited \nfinancial  and  human  resources  and  a  lack  of  interest  among  sector  agencies  in  MRV \nimplementation may hamper the effective implementation of the TA as well as its outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,025,000, of which $999,600 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the CTF and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office facilities, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA  is  expected to  be  implemented from 1  July  2016  to  31  March  2019. The \nexecuting agency will be the MONRE, which is the national focal point implementing the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, as well as the \ndesignated national authority for the Clean Development Mechanism. The MONRE has been \nimplementing various programs and projects on climate change adaptation and mitigation. Its \nInternational Cooperation Department (ICD), as the implementing agency, will (i) coordinate and \nmonitor the consultant services, (ii) collaborate with related stakeholders, and (iii) provide the \nsupport necessary to implement essential activities successfully.  \n ", "5 \n18. The sector agencies, including the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Industry and\nTrade, people\u2019s committees, and the state-owned enterprise, are in charge of implementing the \nCTF  projects.  The  MONRE  will  involve  these  agencies  in  TA  activities  through  various \nopportunities,  including  a  task  force  and  training  program,  to  enhance  the  capacity  and \ncommitment of all agencies, integrate MRVs into their operations, and ensure interagency \ncooperation and coordination. To discuss technical issues, especially with regard to outputs 1 \nand 2, the ICD will form a task force from the staff of relevant agencies (e.g., the Ministry of \nTransport, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the Ministry of Planning and Investment). To \nwork with sector agencies and development partners regarding technical issues, the ICD will \ncollaborate with the Department of Meteorology, Hydrology, and Climate Change under the \nMONRE. Technical staff from this department are currently implementing TA projects supported \nby  the  Government  of  Germany  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the United Nations Development \nProgramme, and the World Bank, among others. \n19. Other  development  partners  are  also  helping  the  government  develop  MRVs.  The\nGovernment of Germany through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit and \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency will establish a national MRV framework. The Food \nand Agriculture Organization will develop an MRV in agriculture, the World Bank will develop an \nMRV in steel and waste management, and the United Nations Development Programme will \ndevelop an MRV in cement. The MONRE, relevant agencies, and other development partners \nwill coordinate their MRV development activities to establish MRVs that are well aligned at \nnational and sector levels. The proposed TA will also work closely with the ongoing TA for the \nCore Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative, Phase II, which \nhas been developing MRV frameworks in the Greater Mekong Subregion countries (footnote 5).\n20. ADB will recruit a consultant firm using quality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 90:10 according to the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended\nfrom time to time). The TA will require 17 person-months of international and 47 person-months \nof national consultant inputs. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \nConsultants will manage equipment, training, seminars, conferences, and surveys. Equipment \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time). Upon completion of the TA, all equipment, materials, and data will be handed over \nto  the  MONRE.  TA  disbursements  will  be  handled  according  to  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n21. The MONRE will continuously maintain and update the information on climate change\nmitigation built on TA outputs with its own funds. The MONRE will disseminate TA outputs \nthrough  knowledge  and/or  media  products,  climate  change  conferences,  and  other  public \ncommunication channels, including the MONRE website. \nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n22. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB\nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $999,600 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Technology Fund for Mainstreaming \nClimate Change Mitigation into National Infrastructure, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.
