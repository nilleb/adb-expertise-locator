THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  At independence, in 1991, the health system in the Republic of Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan) \nfaced significant challenges and emphasized inpatient hospital care. Hospital infrastructure was \nover supplied and not effectively operated and maintained. Health service delivery needed \nrationalizing  and financial,  and  human resources  needed  to  be more  equitably  distributed. \nComplex  legacy  policies  and  institutional  arrangements  between  the  national  and  regional \nauthorities added to the challenges.1 The reforms, which started in 1995, have led to significant \nchanges in health service provision but the results were varied.2 The hospital sector was reduced \nand more emphasis was placed on primary health care (PHC). Some health indices improved \n(e.g., reduced maternal and infant mortality), but they have not improved at the same rate as the \ncountry\u2019s economic growth and there is a pressing need to improve health infrastructure (footnote \n2). \n \n2.  The proposed Integrated Health Care Development Project (the Project) will focus on \nimproving health care infrastructure and services by effectively leveraging public resources to \ncrowd-in  private  sector  participation.  These  solutions  will  result  in  the  following  outcome: \nintegrated and modernized health service network established. The project will be aligned with \nthe following impact: improved quality and efficiency of public health care.3 It will have three \noutputs: (i) PHC health facilities constructed and/or refurbished; (ii) integrated demonstration \nproject developed; and (iii) institutional capacity to develop and implement financially viable \nprojects strengthened. The project will be implemented from 2019 to 2025 and included in the \nKazakhstan country operations business plan 2018\u20132020 as a firm 2018 project.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will help government to prepare the project \nand develop the capacity to implement the proposed project.

Outputs and Activities  \n4.  The TRTA has two outputs: \n \n\u2022  Output 1: Detailed project design and costing prepared. This output will: (i) prepare  \nthe design parameters and detailed costings for of the PHCs (low revenue generating \nfacilities); (ii) prepare detailed project costings, including civil works, consultancy, capacity \nbuilding and project implementation; (iii) prepare project design and monitoring framework, \nincluding specific performance indicators and project activities; (iv) review and update \nhealth facility standards and architectural designs for the proposed project facilities;  \n(v)  develop  the  project  procurement  plan;  and  (vi)  prepare  the  bidding  and related \ndocuments required for the project.  \n \n                                                \n1  A.
