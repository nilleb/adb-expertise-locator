During the 2003 Country  Strategy Program Mission of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the Government of India (\u201cthe Government\u201d) requested technical assistance (TA) for the \ndevelopment  of  a  national  highway  development  strategy  for  Post-National  Highway \nDevelopment Program (NHDP).1 The ADB TA Fact-Finding  Mission2 visited India on 3\u201313 \nMarch 2003 and conducted discussions with officials of the Department of Economic Affairs, \nMinistry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH), and National Highway Authority of India \n(NHAI).  The Mission and the Government reached an understanding on the revision of the \noriginal scope of the TA from the formulation of a post-NHDP national highway development \nstrategy to the development of a high-density corridor (HDC) development program (the HDC \nProgram). Further discussions were held with these agencies in May, August, and November \n2003, on the implementing agency, institutional arrangements for implementation, and detailed \nscope of the TA.  The TA paper was prepared based on the understandings reached with the \nGovernment during these discussions. The TA was included in the 2003 country strategy and \nprogram (CSP)3 for India. The TA framework is attached in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India\u2019s economy has long suffered from a chronic lack of capacity in the national \nhighway systems.  Of 58,211 kilometers (km) of national highways, 39% are still single-lane; \n59% are two lanes; and only 2% are four-lane highways, which is desirable for arterial national \nhighways. Thus, the Government has launched a radical program of upgrading three key \ncorridors: (i) the Golden Quadrilateral, connecting four major metropolitan cities in India; (ii) the \nEast-West Corridor, connecting eastern and western ends of the country; and (iii) the North-\nSouth  Corridor,  connecting  northern  and  southern  ends  of  the  country.  The  corridor \ndevelopment program extends for 13,000 km and cost the nation $13 billion. The NHDP aims  \nto increase integration of the country by connecting four of its corners. ADB, in support of the \nNHDP,4 has provided three loans for 2000\u20132002 and will provide another two loans for 2003\u2013\n2004, with the total loan amount expected to reach $1.5 billion. The World Bank has been \nproviding similar loan amounts for the NHDP with the expected amount of $1.5 billion to $2.0 \nbillion for the same period.   \n \n3.  In March 2003, the HDC Program, which is comparable to the NHDP in scale of \ninvestments ($8 billion) and length (10,000 km), was announced by the Government. The HDC \nProgram was for rehabilitating and widening the two lane or narrower corridors with an average \ndaily traffic of more than 30,000 passenger car equivalent units. MORTH identified 38 HDCs \nqualified for the HDC Program, each ranging of 200\u2013300 km.5 The HDC Program will start this \nyear and will be completed in 7 years (including 2 years of construction).  \n \n4.  Given the limited available public sector funds (i.e., the central road funds can not be \nmade available for the HCD Program because they are already committed for the next 10 years \nfor debt services associated with NHDP development), the Government has decided to adopt \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appears in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 20 June 2003 under the name Post \nNational Highway Development Program National Highway Development Strategy Program. The September 2003 \nissue of the ADB Business Opportunities described the revised scope.  \n2 Comprising S. Tsukada (principal transport specialist/mission leader), F. C. Kawawaki (commercial cofinancing \nspecialist), and C. Kim (sr. private sector specialist).  \n3  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004-2006): India. Manila. \n4  NHDP was started in 1999 and aimed for completion by 2007. \n5 These HDCs would be further expanded to include those corridors which would have lower traffic but provide critical \nlinkage to isolated state capitals. ", "2  \nbuild-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme for the HDC development. However, because tolls can not \nbe charged on a full cost recovery basis, the Government intends to provide a grant to cover a \npart of construction costs, to keep tolls at the level affordable for various groups of society, \nincluding  local  communities.  Under  the  scheme,  prospective  contractors  will  compete  for \nconcessions for toll road operation. Contractors who claim the lowest grant will win the BOT \nbidding.  \n \n5.  Successful implementation of the public-private partnership (PPP) program will require, \nas a prerequisite, the establishment of a policy and institutional framework conducive to private \nsector participation. Thus, MORTH issued in 1997 Guidelines for the Private Sector Participation \nin the Road Infrastructure, and took policy actions, including (i) according tax exemption status to \nBOT investors; (ii) indicating government commitment in all preparatory activities, including land \nacquisition and removal of utilities; (iii) enabling the Government to provide grants of up to 40% \nof the project cost; (iv) allowing foreign direct investments up to 100% equity participation; (v) \nallowing duty free import of modern high performance construction equipment; and (vi) amending \nthe National Highway Act to authorize private sector investors to operate a part of the national \nhighway system and collect tolls under Government regulation.  \n \n6.  Another critical element of the institutional framework is the Government\u2019s toll policy.  \nThe current policy is that, once the national highways are upgraded to four lanes, they will be \nconverted to toll roads. The level of tolls is uniformly set by the Government for the national \nhighways. Tolls are adjusted for inflation based on the whole sale price index every year for \nBOT sections and every 3 years for NHAI sections. The tolls are not set for the full cost \nrecovery, but to cover operation and maintenance and a part of debt services.  \n \n7.  The implementing agency is another crucial issue. Originally, MORTH was assigned to \nimplement the HDC Program.  However, the Government has later delegated the task to NHAI, \nan agency better equipped for the PPP program. NHAI was empowered to form joint ventures \nwith private sector investors, form special purpose vehicles, invest and lend the funds for such \nventures, and raise funds through issuing debentures. \n \n8.  While NHAI has used PPP schemes for highway development in a number of projects, it \nhas never undertaken BOT development of this magnitude, entailing 140-160 BOT investments. \nThis will require, within NHAI, the establishment of a unit specializing in the HDC Program.  \n    \n9.  Based on the above framework, further discussions were held with the Government on \nhow the HDC Program is to be implemented and in what manner ADB can assist with its \nprocess.  The possible framework of ADB assistance under consideration is as follows:  \n \n(i)  Provision of TA. TA could be provided for defining institutional arrangements for \nprogram implementation, including organizational arrangements to be set up \nwithin NHAI, project management consultants, and financing mechanisms to \nfacilitate project preparation and enhance the financial viability of BOT projects.  \n \n(ii)  Engineering support facility. The HDC Program will require the establishment \nof a revolving fund that will enable NHAI to prepare projects in cost-effective \nmanner, as the money spent for the project preparation will be recouped from \nBOT contractors and used again for other projects. Based on the 2003 CSP, \ndiscussion is under way for the possible provision of an engineering support loan \nfor providing seed money for the revolving fund.   \n ", "      3 \n(iii)  Sector loans. Once the TA is undertaken and the revolving fund is established, \nADB would start processing a sector loan to help develop BOT projects. ADB \nwould finance the public sector contribution of the construction cost, while the \nrest of the construction cost and the operation and maintenance cost would be \ncovered by the private sector.  Once the sector loan is included in the CSP, it is \nlikely to lead to a series of lending for the highway sector, similar in scale to the  \nNHDP. ADB\u2019s intervention would cover one third or one fourth of the Program \ncost.   \n \n(iv)  ADB assistance through private sector operations. ADB can provide partial \ncredit guarantees which do not require sovereign counter guarantees to private \nsector financiers to facilitate borrowings by BOT contractors. ADB could also \nconsider  providing  debt  and  equity  investments  in  BOT  contractors.  Such \ninvestments would require discussions with the Government, which has shown \ninterest in these private sector financing and guarantee schemes.  \n \n10.  The TA is an integral part of the package of assistance noted in para. 9, covering the \ninitial stage of the development. The provision of the TA in a timely manner is critical for the \nsuccessful implementation of the HDC Program.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to facilitate the implementation of the HDC Program by (i) \nestablishing  institutional  arrangements  necessary  for  project  management  and  financing \nmechanisms, and (ii) elaborating the concept of the entire HDC Program to provide an overall \nplan for its implementation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have five components: \n \n(i)  Institutional arrangements.  The first component will (i) develop institutional \narrangements needed for the efficient delivery of the overall program, and (ii) \ndefine those key concepts such as the \u201crevolving fund for project preparation \nfacility\u201d and the \u201ccapital investment grant fund\u201d (Appendix 3). \n \n(ii)  Traffic projection and prioritization.  The second component will support  (i) \nreviewing  the  current  traffic  projections  for  individual  HDCs,  completed  by \nMORTH; (ii) developing a traffic forecast methodology to be applied for the HDC \nProgram and, based on the methodology, forecasting traffic for each HDC; (iii) \ntaking stock of current road conditions (particularly road roughness), right of way \navailability, and environmental and social impediments; and (iv) based on these \nanalyses,  prioritizing  investments  and  developing  a  time  table  for  the  HDC \nProgram implementation. \n \n(iii)  PPP investment schemes. The third component will support (i) reviewing the \nPPP schemes such as annuity-based concession, toll-based BOT, and special \npurpose  vehicles,  and  comparing  their  relative  merits;  (ii)  recommending \nappropriate forms of PPP schemes to be applied for HDC development, including ", "4  \na BOT scheme with grant provision from NHAI and annuity-based concession \nwith tolling right to be transferred to the concessionaire; (iii) developing the \nappropriate modality for ADB lending through its public sector window, to fit the \noperating principles set out in ADB\u2019s Charter; and (iv) if needed, recommending \nmodifications to the current model contract documents for the PPP. \n \n(iv)  Program  design.  The  fourth  component  would  design  a  structure  for  ADB \nfinancing of part of the HDC Program, under the sector loan modality. ADB\u2019s \nintervention would cover one third or one fourth of the HDC Program to be \nmanaged by a project management consultant or one chief general manager. \nThe tasks include (i) recommending to NHAI the subprogram to be covered by a \nseries of ADB sector loans; (ii) developing the concepts for each HDC under the \nsubprogram;  (iii)  identifying  HDCs  to  be  included  in  the  sector  loan;  (iv) \nconducting initial environmental screening for each HDC to be selected; and (v) \nconducting the sector environmental assessment and developing road safety \nstandards and necessary activities to be included in the sector loan.  \n \n(v)  Social safeguards.  The fifth component will cover (i) an initial poverty and \nsocial assessment for each HDC in the subprogram, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Initial Poverty and Social Assessment; (ii) initial screening for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  by  filling  out  the  relevant \nchecklists; (iii) a resettlement framework and indigenous people development \nframework, to be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy.   \n \n13.  Components (i)\u2013(iv) will be carried out by a consulting firm and component (v) will be \ncarried  out  by  individual  consultants.    Where  conducting  components  (iv)  and  (v),  the \nconsultants will refer to the work which done during the preparation and processing of the \nNational Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, comprising $574,100 in \nforeign exchange costs and $325,900 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$700,000 equivalent on a grant basis, to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $574,100 \nand $125,900 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nremaining  $200,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs,  which  will  include  office \naccommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, communication, transportation, and surveys. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are detailed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  NHAI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  By  January  2004,  NHAI  will  establish  a  TA  \nimplementation unit that will be the focal point for implementing the TA.  \n \n16.  ADB  will  engage  a  consulting  firm,  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures with the simplified technical proposal. The task will require 18 person-months input \nof international and 8 person-months input of domestic consultants. ADB will also engage two \nindividual consultants, one international and one domestic. The selection of the consulting firm \nand  individual  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of ", "      5 \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of \ndomestic consultants.  \n \n17.  The TA will commence in January 2004 and be closed in December 2004.  Terms of \nreference (TOR) for the consulting firm are outlined in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding $700,000 on a grant basis to the Government of \nIndia, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

Components 1\u20134 \n1.  Team of Experts. The consulting firm will form a team of eight experts with the following \nqualifications: \n \n(i)  International transport economist. The economist will have had (a) experience \nin public-private partnership (PPP) projects in the highway sector; (b) knowledge \nof highway development in the South Asia Region; (c) knowledge of the policy \nand procedural requirements of multilateral aid agencies such as the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) or the World Bank; and (d) preferably, knowledge on \nthe India\u2019s consulting and construction industries. The economist will lead the \nconsultant team.   \n \n(ii)  International  project  finance  specialist.  The  specialist  will  have  had  (a) \nextensive first-hand experience with build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes or \nsimilar private sector participation (PSP) schemes, in the transport sector; and \n(b) broad experience in implementing BOT or PSP projects, knowing the whole \nprocess  of  processing  PSP  projects,  including  conceptualization,  bidding, \nnegotiation, and financial closure. Adequate knowledge on India\u2019s financial sector \n(banking,  infrastructure  financing,  credit  rating,  India\u2019s  capital  markets)  is \npreferable.  \n \n(iii)  International transport specialist. The specialist will have had (a) extensive \nexperience working for the multilateral aid agencies such as ADB and WB; and \n(b)  knowledge  of  traffic  projection,  particularly  on  toll  roads,  which  require \ndemand forecast for with and without toll scenarios; and (c) extensive experience \norganizing traffic counts, compiling traffic data, and conducting traffic projection. \n \n(iv)  International  environmental  specialist.  The  specialist  will  have  had  (a) \nextensive experience working for multilateral aid agencies such as ADB and WB; \nand (b) knowledge of the safeguard policies of these agencies in the area of \nenvironment; and (c) knowledge of Indian Government requirements on the \nenvironment. \n \n(v)  International road safety specialist. The specialist will have had extensive \nexperience  assisting  developing  countries  in  road safety. Extensive working \nexperience with multilateral aid agencies such as ADB and WB is preferable. \nAreas  of  particular  importance  are  the  enforcement  of  traffic  regulation, \nemergency road services, road signage, highway design for road safety, and \nroad safety audit and traffic engineering.  \n \n(vi)  Domestic financial analyst. The analyst will have had extensive experience in \nfinancial analysis and model development for financing of infrastructure sector \nprojects.   \n \n(vii)  Domestic environmental specialist. The specialist will have had extensive \nexperience in environmental assessment of highway development projects in \nIndia, and should had extensive experience in field surveys.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n(viii)  Domestic  transport  specialist.  The  specialist  will  have  had  extensive \nexperience organizing traffic counts, compiling traffic data, and conducting traffic \nprojections.  \n \n2.  Scope of Work. The team of experts will carry out the following tasks: \n \n  (i)  Development of institutional arrangements:  \n \n(a)  The  implementation  of  this  magnitude  of  the  HDC  Program  requires \nsystematic preparation of individual projects (likely to total 140\u2013160). This \nwill require the establishment of institutional arrangements for the efficient \nimplementation of the high density corridor (HDC) Program.   \n(b)  The implementation of the above HDC Program would also require the \nestablishment  of  a  revolving  fund  to  enable  the  National  Highways \nAuthority of India (NHAI) to prepare projects in a cost-effective manner, \nas the money spent for project preparation will be recouped from BOT \ncontractors and reused for other projects.  The Consultants are required \nto elaborate the concept of  the \u201crevolving fund for project preparation \nfacility,\u201d describe how the revolving fund is to be structured and managed, \nand estimate resource requirements. The task includes the estimation of \nthe  appropriate  level  of  charges  by  NHAI  to  the  successful  BOT \ncontractors. The charges should include the cost of project preparation, \nincluding the resettlement plan, environmental assessment, and other \nreasonable activities to be born by the BOT contractors.   \n(c)  Given that the HDCs have been used for decades with no tolls being \ncharged, but will be converted into toll roads with the level of tolls being \ncontrolled by the Government regulations, the private sector can not \ndevelop, operate, and maintain the roads without public sector support. \nHDCs are, therefore, envisaged to be carried out as PPP. The possible \nPPP  schemes  include  the  government  provision  of  a  grant  to  BOT \ncontractors to cover part of the construction costs, paid as a lump-sum \nbasis or in tranches. Since a number of BOT/concession projects are \nbeing implemented simultaneously during 5\u20136 years, a pool of grants to \nbe paid to the contractors at different construction stages, should be \nconsidered.
