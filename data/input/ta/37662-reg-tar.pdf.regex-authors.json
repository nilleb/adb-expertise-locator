Development progress in the Pacific region is not encouraging. Economic growth has \naveraged less than 1% per capita annually over the past 30 years. Critical investments in basic \ninfrastructure and human potential (such as health and education) have lagged well behind needs. \nPoverty is a hard and growing reality for many. Youth unemployment is high and rising, fueling the \ninevitable social strains. Skilled professionals increasingly seek better opportunities abroad, and in-\ncountry migration to towns is growing, even when good opportunities do not exist. \n \n2.  In  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs),  concerned  leaders  in  government, \nbusiness, and civil society are increasingly questioning existing policies and institutions and their \nability to support long-term economic growth that would lead to income opportunities, jobs, and the \nprovision of essential services. Their reservations have triggered significant discussion of private \nsector development (PSD) reform in recent years, and have increased the demand for fresh \nthinking and new solutions. PSD now features prominently in policy dialogue, regional declarations, \nand reform initiatives.  \n \n3.  PSD analysis and benchmarking, especially the private sector assessments (PSAs) of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)1 and  Doing  Business2 surveys  by  the  World  Bank  and  the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation,  have  elevated  the  level  of  awareness,  understanding,  and \npublic debate of the underlying issues, as well as the positive relationship between private-sector-\nled economic growth and poverty reduction. Development partners have been responding to such \ndevelopments with an increased focus of resources on PSD.3 In particular, ADB has elevated PSD \nas a major thrust in its Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009.4 \n \n4.  However, PSD diagnostic studies and regional consultations indicate that imperatives of aid \neffectiveness  and  development  results  require  (i)  strengthened  economic  analysis  in  country \nstrategies within the context of the constraints to PSD, (ii) the identification of more effective ways \nto deliver economic growth results, and (iii) improved partnership mechanisms with governments \nand  the  private  sector,  and  among  development  partners.  The  proposed  regional  technical \nassistance (TA) will strengthen the expertise and resources required to deliver these outcomes. \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

The low levels of competitiveness, investment, and economic growth in the Pacific region \nare largely due to the high costs of doing business and the inadequacies of institutions.6 Common \nPSD issues and challenges facing many PDMCs include (i) the pervasive role of the state in many \naspects of economic activity, thereby inadvertently exacerbating rather than ameliorating problems \nassociated with size and geographical isolation; (ii) the failure of financial markets to intermediate \nefficiently and provide access to credit for the private sector, especially in rural areas; (iii) business \nlaws and regulations that are outdated and inadequate to support modern business transactions; \nand (iv) inefficient, unreliable, and often expansive infrastructure and services, often provided by \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs), which place an unnecessary burden on business. \n \n6.  While PSD advocacy and reform activities by ADB and other development partners in these \npriority areas have created a tangible reform momentum, translating this into development results \nis still in its infancy. Transforming the high profile discussion into effective policy change and, \nultimately, higher growth and greater prosperity in the region remains a challenge. Issues and \nsolutions are still imperfectly understood by policy makers, civil society, and even the private sector \nand  development  partners.  Vested  interests  often  oppose  meaningful  change,  while  reform \nchampions often do not receive the necessary support. \n \n7.  Placing the private sector at the heart of the economy will require major efforts on the part \nof governments. In partnership with other agencies, ADB must find ways to support the necessary \nchange processes and dynamics. Diagnostic studies, policy dialogue, advisory work and capacity \ndevelopment, supported by effective communications strategies, are instrumental ingredients of an \neffective PSD assistance strategy. The translation of reform recommendations into action must be \nfacilitated through continuous engagement and dialogue, and effective change management. The \nprivate sector needs to be engaged, as it must play a crucial role in investment, innovation, and job \ncreation. The communication gap between governments and the private sector in many PDMCs \nmust  be  bridged.  Reform  champions  in  government,  business,  and  civil  society  should  be \nsupported.  Moreover,  the  capacity  to  rapidly  respond  to  reform  opportunities  needs  to  be \ndeveloped. There is a risk that the momentum may fade away unless appropriate action is taken. \n \n8.  ADB has established substantial PSD expertise, a body of knowledge based on PSAs and \nother assessments, a strong PSD focus in regional and country strategies, and operational PSD \nexperience. ADB proposes to further expand its strategic, programmatic, and implementation focus \nin this area, both regionally and at country level, as committed in ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u2013\n2009. With its sectoral expertise and multilateral structure, ADB can serve as an effective partner \nfor PDMCs and development partners in initiating, implementing, and coordinating PSD-related \nanalysis, policy dialogue, capacity development, and reform design and implementation, towards \nthe outcome of a substantial improvement of the business environment in the region. Moreover, \nADB is well placed to continually monitor and evaluate PSD reform progress, thereby ensuring that \nlessons are incorporated in future program and project design.  \n \n9.  The proposed TA provides the framework and resources necessary to allow a degree of \nlocalization,  responsiveness,  flexibility,  and  coordination  and  cooperation  as  economic  reform \nopportunities arise in specific PDMCs and throughout the region. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004.

In line with ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009 and Private Sector Development Strategy,7 \nthe TA will contribute to poverty reduction in PDMCs by promoting enterprise, investment, and \neconomic growth\u2014as measured by improved trends in private sector investment and economic \ngrowth rates. Towards this end, the TA aims at improving the business environment by promoting \neffective  PSD  policies,  strategies,  practices,  and  activities  in  priority  areas\u2014as  measured  by \nimproved ratings in selected \u201cDoing Business\u201d indicators (footnote 2), and ongoing qualitative \nassessments through ADB PSAs. An increase in the number of quality public\u2013private dialogues \nand partnerships, an important indicator of improved processes, will also be targeted. \n \n11.  The TA will augment ADB\u2019s capacity to respond rapidly and strategically, and within the \ncontext of country strategies, to PDMCs\u2019 unique PSD reform needs and emerging priorities. The \nTA  will  provide  short-term  expertise  on  critical  business  environment  issues  and  longer-term \nengagement on sustainable capacity development. The TA is designed to add substantial value to \nADB\u2019s regular PSD work by (i) supplementing the relatively limited ADB TA resources for PSD in \nthe Pacific; (ii) increasing the breadth, depth, responsiveness, and effectiveness of ADB\u2019s capacity \nto manage and deliver a PSD program in PDMCs; (iii) amplifying the engagement with PDMCs in \nterms  of  policy  dialogue,  knowledge  management,  and  technical  support;  and  (iv)  providing \nongoing evaluation of reform programs with a view to sharpen future reform initiatives. The TA will \naugment ADB\u2019s staff skills, and financial and technical resources dedicated to the implementation \nof ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  In line with PSA findings and ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009, the TA will focus on, but \nnot be restricted to, the following core themes: \n \n(i)  SOE reform and public\u2013private partnerships8\u2014focusing on government policies on \nSOEs (relating to ownership, performance, and divestment), economic regulation, \nlegal framework and opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships, privatization, and \nSOE corporate governance; \n(ii)  financial sector reform\u2014focusing on secured transactions frameworks, rural and \nmicrofinance, financial sector outreach, financial products and services, and partial \ncredit guarantees;9 \n(iii)  institutional,  legal,  and  regulatory  business  environment\u2014focusing  on  reforming \nbusiness law and strengthening property rights;10 and \n(iv)  sectoral mainstreaming of PSD. \n \n13.  Activities related to the core themes will be carried out using a mix of country-focused, \nmulti-country,  and  regional  approaches  and  processes  in  the  following  three  main  output \ncategories: \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy. Manila. \n8  The initiative will build on ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Improving Delivery of Infrastructure Services. Manila \n(TA 6257-REG). This TA  aims at promoting public\u2013private partnerships, regional cooperation, and cost and delivery \nefficiency to improve the delivery of infrastructure services in the Pacific.  \n9  Related diagnostic studies have been carried out under ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Diagnostic Studies for \nSecured Transactions Reform in the Pacific Region. Manila (TA 6202-REG). \n10  Related diagnostic studies have been carried out under ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Improving the Legal \nBusiness Environment in the Pacific Region. Manila (TA 6162-REG). \n ", "4   \n(i)  Diagnostic studies, dialogue, and communication. A series of diagnostic studies \non relevant PSD issues, strategies, and approaches will be undertaken, with a view \nto strengthen country PSD strategies, promote and underpin policy dialogue, trigger \nand inform reform action, and disseminate the findings to relevant stakeholders and \nthe general public. A strategic framework for communication and dialogue will be \ndeveloped to disseminate information on regional and international \u201cgood practice\u201d \nPSD policy, approaches, and achievements; increase awareness and stakeholder \ndialogue on economic growth issues, including the links with poverty reduction; and \nimprove media coverage of PSD issues.  \n(ii)  Rapid  response,  technical  advice,  and  capacity  development.  The  TA  will \nenable  ADB  to  rapidly  respond  to  reform  opportunities  and  support  reform \nchampions. Short-term technical expertise will be provided in priority reform areas \n(core themes) in supplementation and amplification of ADB country strategies and \nprograms. Due attention will be given to capacity development of government and \nprivate sector organizations in PSD assessment, policy and strategy formulation, \nand reform implementation. \n(iii)  Regional  initiatives  and  monitoring.  With  a  view  to  promoting  regional \ncooperation and integration, support will be provided to regional PSD forums and \ninitiatives.  Links  to  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Secretariat,  including  the  annual \nForum Economic Ministers Meetings, and the new Pacific Islands Private Sector \nOrganization,  representing  national  private  sector  organizations,  will  be  sought. \nSupport  will  also  be  provided  for  the  implementation  of  the  Pacific  Plan  for \nStrengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration (Pacific Plan). In addition, a \nperformance-monitoring system in support of pursuing development effectiveness \nwill be established under the TA. \n \n14.  All  PDMCs  will  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  TA  upon  request.11 TA  resources  will \nprimarily focus on PDMCs that are committed to PSD reform and have the capacity to effectively \nabsorb related assistance. Some consideration may be given to PSD issues and solutions in \nweakly performing PDMCs, taking into account the importance of economic growth for job creation \nand delivery of services in fragile country environments. In all cases, the respective ADB country \nstrategy  and  program  and  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Strategy  2005\u20132009,  will  be  the  entry  point  for \nconsideration of subprojects to be financed under the TA. \n \n15.  The TA will proactively seek cooperation and coordination with multilateral agencies and \nfacilities active in PSD or related areas (e.g., with the World Bank, Foreign Investment Advisory \nServices [FIAS], Pacific Enterprise Partnership [PEP], and Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre [PFTAC]), as well as bilateral partners. Development partners will be engaged at project, \ncountry, regional, and institutional levels. An existing funding agency working group on PSD in the \nPacific will be instrumental in ensuring effective strategic coordination.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $8,700,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis, $1,100,000 by ADB's TA funding program and $7,600,000 by the Government of \nAustralia, with the latter amount to be administered by ADB. Participating PDMC governments will \ncontribute  to  the  costs  of  activities  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff  salaries,  office \naccommodation, local transport, support services, and facilitation of consultations. Detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n11  No TA funds will be disbursed for any subproject without ADB first obtaining approval or \u201cno objection\u201d from the PDMC \nfor the RETA and the specific subproject to be financed thereunder. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented by ADB. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department (PARD) will be responsible \nfor all TA activities. The TA office will be established in, and managed by, ADB\u2019s Pacific Liaison \nand Cooperation Office (PLCO). PSD programming support, subproject design and implementation, \nas well as monitoring and reporting will be undertaken by PLCO, supported by TA consultants. The \nimplementation  of  TA  activities  may  be  delegated  to  other  ADB  offices.  PARD\u2019s  regional \nmanagement team (RMT), led by the director general, will provide strategic and tactical guidance. \nRMT approval of design and implementation arrangements will be required for TA subprojects \nexceeding $500,000. RMT may seek advice and engagement from relevant ADB departments or \noffices. While ADB will be solely responsible in managing the identification and implementation of \nproject  activities  within  the  framework  of  its  individual  country  strategies,  participating  PDMC \ngovernments, the private sector, and other development partners will be engaged and consulted. \n \n18.  Effective  and  efficient  process  management  and  coordination  mechanisms  will  be \nestablished, including a performance tracking and reporting system for development effectiveness. \nTA progress reports will be prepared on a regular basis. A comprehensive TA mid-term review will \nbe  carried  out.  Project-related  information,  reports,  and  other  relevant  documentation  will  be \npublished on a dedicated Website.  \n \n19.  The TA will have a term of 5 years and will be implemented from December 2006 to \nNovember 2011. The implementation of TA activities will require the services of international \nconsultants (up to 250 person-months) and national consultants (up to 100 person-months). The \noutline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. While the TA will use a mix of \nindividual consultants and consulting firms, preference may be given to recruiting consulting firms \nto enable coordination of the inputs of the various experts.12 Equipment and materials to be \nfinanced under the TA will be procured by the consultants or by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $7,600,000 to be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$1,100,000 on a grant basis, for the Private Sector Development Initiative. \n                                                 \n12   Consultant assignments and associated expertise and outputs will be determined on the basis of local demand for, \nand hence nature of, relevant reform initiatives. The required expertise may be highly diverse and specialized, and \nthe same expertise may simultaneously be needed in several PDMCs. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nContribution to poverty  \u2022  Improved trends in  \u2022  Government  \u2022  Government \nreduction by promoting  economic growth  statistics  commitment to and \nenterprise, investment,  rates in PDMCs  \u2022  Central Bank reports ownership of PSD \nand economic growth  \u2022  Increased private  \u2022  ADB economic  reforms \n  sector share of GDP  reports and updates  \u2022  Political stability in \n  in PDMCs  participating PDMCs \n  \u2022  Increased private  \u2022  No major natural \n  sector investment  disasters \n  rates in PDMCs  Risk \n\u2022  Limited private \nsector response to \nimproved \ninvestment climate \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nFocused reform  \u2022  Improved ratings in  \u2022  Annual reports and  \u2022  Government\u2019s \npolicies, strategies, and  selected \u201cDoing  progress reports  commitment to, and \nmeasures for an  Business\u201d indicators  under the TA  approval and \nimproved enabling  \u2022  Improved qualitative  (published on ADB\u2019s  ownership of, PSD \nbusiness environment,  ratings in ADB PSAs   website)  reform strategies, \nwith emphasis on core  \u2022  Increased number  \u2022  PSA updates and  approaches, \nthemes of (i) state- and improved quality  other business and  practices, and \nowned enterprise reform  of public\u2013private  government surveys  activities can be \nand public\u2013private  dialogues and  financed under the  achieved \npartnerships, (ii)  partnerships  TA  \u2022  Support for reform \nfinancial intermediation,    \u2022  Government reports  activities by the \n(iii) business law and    and economic  private sector, \nregulation, and (iv)  strategy documents  unions, and other \nmainstreaming of PSD  \u2022  ADB economic and  key stakeholders \nin priority sectors  country assistance  Risk \nreports  \u2022  Slow pace of reform \nimplementation \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The outline terms of reference for consultants describe the main tasks in each of the output \ncategories of the program of activities under the technical assistance (TA), as well as support in \nproject  management.  The  three  output  categories  are  (i)  diagnostic  studies,  dialogue,  and \ncommunication; (ii) rapid response, technical advice, and capacity development; and (iii) regional \ninitiatives  and  monitoring.  The  Pacific  Liaison  and  Coordination  Office  (PLCO)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will coordinate the program of activities. The required areas of expertise \nfor international and national experts include (i) private sector development (PSD) strategies and \npolicies,  (ii)  institutional  change,  (iii)  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  reform,  (iv)  public\u2013private \npartnerships, (v) legal and regulatory reform, (vi) financial sector development, (vii) capacity building, \n(viii) knowledge management and communication, (ix) information systems, and (x) PSD monitoring \nand evaluation. \n \n2.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  will  be  formulated  as  concrete  subprojects  materialize. \nSubprojects will be determined as the work plan is developed under the TA. Upon TA approval, \nconsideration will be given to inputs from key stakeholders, to reform opportunities that arise, and to \npositively assessed requests for support. All proposals for support will be assessed against decision \ncriteria  including  (i)  relevance  and  potential  of  the  proposed  reform  measure  from  the  PSD \nperspective, (ii) PSD potential in the country concerned, (iii) complementary nature to ADB country \nstrategy and program, (iv) government reform ownership, (v) existence of local reform champions, \n(vi) potential to trigger or leverage broader reform measures (beyond the specific proposal), and (vii) \nfunding agency coordination. Proposals for TA support can be submitted directly by governments of \nPacific developing member countries (PDMCs) and by key stakeholders through their government. \nThey can also be triggered by ADB, e.g., by country desks or sector desks in need of PSD support. \n \nA.  Diagnostic Studies, Dialogue, and Communication \n3.
