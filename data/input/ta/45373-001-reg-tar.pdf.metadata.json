INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA)1 will support \ncountry-specific  and  regionally  consistent  water  tariff  frameworks  and  guidelines.  This  will \ncontribute  to  improving  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation  through \nincreased transparency and predictability of tariffs and improved fiscal positions of public water-\nsupply institutions. The TA will cover three South Asian countries\u2014India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \nSince 2004, the India country partnership strategy2 (CPS), or country strategy and program, has \nindicated tariff reform and cost recovery as one of the main features of its urban strategy. In \nNepal,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  assisted  in  developing  and  implementing \nvarious acts and policies, including the Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission Act, and will \nremain engaged in policy dialogue and assist with implementing the policies during the CPS, \n2010\u20132012.3 The Sri Lanka CPS, 2012\u201320164 emphasizes improved self-financing performance \nthrough the implementation of sector reforms and cost recovery tariffs in the water sector. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  From 2000 to 2010, rapid urbanization in South Asia has contributed substantially to \ngross national product. In some countries, the contribution to gross national product from the \nurban sector alone has grown by 10 percentage points, which is substantial and reflects South \nAsia\u2019s continued and robust recent growth. However, urban infrastructure development and \nbasic  public  services\u2014in  particular,  water  supply  services\u2014have  lagged  behind  the  rapid \neconomic growth. Many cities suffer from dilapidated and aging public infrastructure, or a lack of \ninfrastructure, and substandard service levels. \n \n3.  As urban infrastructure and services are the mandate of the public sector, governments \nprovide funding for asset creation. In most cases, the government also continues to operate \npublic utilities, including for water, sanitation, and solid waste. Due to the weak fiscal position of \nthe local governments which often run the public utilities, central grants and external aid funds \nare required for asset creation. Further, due to the weak capacity and limited operational and \nfinancial resources of local governments, public utilities are not operated efficiently or in a \nfinancially sustainable manner. \n \n4.  The urban water sector in South Asia is in need of a fresh injection of funds and \nexpertise from various sources, including the private sector. To promote and attract private \nsector participation in the water sector, a sound regulatory framework for water tariffs is needed \nto establish an enabling environment. Further, a transparent and stable tariff framework can \nimprove  the  fiscal  position  of  local  governments  and  contribute  to  achieving  financial  and \noperational sustainability in the provision of water supply. Accordingly, a framework for water \ntariffs,  specific  to  each  country  and  with  implementation  based  on  the  principles  of  cost \nrecovery, would help establish the needed enabling environment conducive for private sector \ninvestment. The immediate task is to identify what barriers exist in current tariff mechanisms in \nSouth Asia that constrain the sector\u2019s operational and financial sustainability and hamper private \nsector participation. \n                                                 \n1  The proposed TA was not included in the indicative assistance pipeline of ADB. 2010.

Regulatory framework for water tariffs. From economic, social, and environmental \nperspectives, India is in need of a national tariff framework to regulate urban water. The lack of \nclauses in the existing regulations that directly address tariffs and cost recovery has contributed \nto  the  current  water  problems,  which  include  diminishing  per  capita availability,  increasing \nissues of water quality, and inadequate access to and supply of water. The prevailing water tariff \nis not set at a level that achieves full cost recovery. Government-run water utilities typically \nrecover less than operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The utilities, therefore, are not \nfinancially self-sufficient and depend on government subsidies. In this regard, formulation of \nnational guidelines on water tariffs has become critical in order to steer the government-run \nwater utilities gradually towards full cost recovery as well as to ensure social affordability to \nmake the sector sustainable. India\u2019s National Water Policy of 20026 did not directly address the \nmechanism for tariff adjustment. Since 2002, there has been increased focus by national and \nstate officials on adequacy and quality of water supply. Proper pricing of water has been the \nsubject of many state consultation meetings as more cities move towards continuous supply \nand improved water quality. The Ministry of Urban Development has established service-level \nbenchmarks, and the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) includes \ncost recovery as one of the reform measures. Hence, there is a need for overall national \nguidelines on water tariffs for India. \n \n6.  In Nepal, the Nepal Water Supply Corporation Act 1989 provides that the Nepal Water \nSupply Corporation can impose fees and charges to recover operational costs. The Drinking \nWater Regulation, 1998 also empowers the water supplier to levy a fee as fixed by the Service \nCharge Fixation Committee. The Nepal Water Supply Corporation Act, 2nd Amendment (2007), \nWater Supply Management Board Act (2006), and Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission Act \n(2006) have facilitated improved management of water and sanitation services. The Water \nSupply Tariff Fixation Commission was also created as the regulator for water tariffs under \nongoing ADB loans.7 These regulations have established the legal basis for private sector \nmanagement of schemes and independent fee setting and regulation and are applicable to all \nurban schemes. However, there have been no clear guidelines on water tariff setting that \nconsider the full economic value of water. \n \n7.  In Sri Lanka, service areas outside Colombo are not subject to a tariff framework to \nguide cost recovery and financial sustainability. Assessment of the existing frameworks that \nestablish  principles  and  methods  to  attain full cost  recovery  can  encourage  private  sector \ninvestment  in  the  sector,  be  it  in  rehabilitation  or  water  supply  augmentation.  In  addition, \ncontinued  efforts  were  identified  by  CPS,  2012\u20132016  to  (i)  improve  the  self-financing \nperformance of operating entities through regulation and cost recovery together with other \napproaches,  and  (ii)  provide  continued  support  on  water  conservation  through  properly \naddressing the economic value of water in the tariff and regulatory framework. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  The TA will assist the governments to prepare and/or update national guidelines on \nwater tariff formulation. The national guidelines on water tariffs will conceptualize the idea that \nwater is an economic good. The prepared and updated guidelines will be a major step towards \nwater demand management and conservation and will contribute to national sector strategies \nand long-term sustainability of the water utilities. \n                                                 \n6  The  first  national  water  policy  was  adopted  by  the  National  Water  Resources  Council  in  1987  and  was \nsubsequently updated in 2002.

Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n9.  The impact of the TA is improved water demand management by water utilities and \nwater conservation. \n \n10.  The outcome of the TA is the adoption of tariffs that enable cost recovery. The national \nguidelines on water tariffs will include (i) detailed water tariff formulas for full cost recovery of \nO&M and investment costs, and full cost recovery of only O&M; (ii) tariff approval processes and \nrelated institutional arrangements; (iii) mechanisms for lifeline tariffs for the poor; and (iv) public \nconsultation mechanisms prior to increasing water tariffs. The TA will contribute to long-term \nfinancial sustainability of water utilities and to strengthening the enabling environment for private \nsector participation. The focus will be on first achieving full cost recovery of O&M costs. It is \nanticipated that, by 2013, national guidelines for full cost recovery tariffs will be in place to guide \nwater utilities in formulating different levels of tariffs in accordance with the level of political, \ninstitutional, and financial readiness. \n \n11.  The TA will produce a high-quality water tariff study to guide the governments to move to \na differential and progressive bloc-based water tariff system. The study will provide guidelines \non  how  water  tariffs  can  be  formulated  in  response  to  demands  from  the  subsistence  to \ncommercial levels. The water tariff study will be further developed into a useful knowledge \nproduct to be published in 2013 for wider dissemination. \n \n12.  The TA will focus on   \n(i)  a preliminary review of the ongoing water sector reforms, particularly tariff reform \nand the current tariff structures;  \n(ii)  detailed case studies of the reform-linked JNNURM in two pilot areas receiving \nnational and external aid assistance (in particular ADB loans and grants) as well \nas in three pilot areas in Sri Lanka and Nepal in the urban water sector; the study \nwill  include  pre-reform  and  post-reform  assessment  of  service  quality, \nmanagement  structures,  structure  of  water  tariffs,  and  financial  health;  the \nassessment will provide valuable information for each country;  \n(iii)  proposed national guidelines for each country on water tariff formulation;  \n(iv)  a proposed state-specific implementation framework for India; and  \n(v)  a knowledge and information dissemination channel to share experiences among \ncountries. \n \n13.  The outputs are  \n(i)  a summary of the current tariff structures;  \n(ii)  an assessment of the effectiveness of the ongoing reforms in the water sector;  \n(iii)  a blueprint of the national guidelines on water tariffs;  \n(iv)  implementation  frameworks  in  India  at  the  state  level  and  a  set  of \nrecommendations for the two pilot Indian cities under the JNNURM and the three \npilot areas in Nepal and Sri Lanka; and  \n(v)  a knowledge channel through workshops and publication where sector-related \ninformation can be sourced and shared among governments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented in three stages. The first stage will include the following \nactivities for the five pilot areas: (i) collecting existing data on the current water tariff structures, \nincluding  fixed  or  flat-rate  tariffs,  volumetric  and  progressive  bloc-based  tariffs  and  their \n ", "4 \nrelevance and problems, and related institutional arrangements; (ii) collecting existing data \nconcerning  water  sector  tariff  reforms;  (iii)  preparing  a  general  review  of  the  water  tariff \nstructures of the three participating countries; and (iv) preparing a general assessment of the \neffectiveness of reforms, including a pre-reform and post-reform comparison of service quality, \nmanagement structures, water tariff reforms, and financial health. Findings and key issues from \nthe first stage will be included in the inception report and discussed at the inception workshop.  \n \n15.  The second stage will consist of preparing national guidelines on water tariffs, including \ntariff setting and formulation; detailed formulas for full cost recovery for water tariffs; assessment \nand determination of a range of tariff structures that could satisfy the design objectives of cost \nrecovery, economic efficiency, equity, and affordability; and addressing the social dimension of \nthe national guidelines on water tariffs, including public hearings and consultation process, \nlifeline tariff rate, and methods of subsidies. The second stage will also include a continuation of \nthe case study of five pilot areas and preparation of the state implementation framework for the \nnational guidelines for India. Findings and key issues from the second stage will be included in \nthe midterm report and discussed at the midterm workshop.  \n \n16.  The final stage will consist of (i) completion of the case study of the five pilot areas in the \nthree participating countries and the state implementation framework together with the specific \nrecommendations for India in relation to water tariff structures, detailed tariff calculation formula, \ntariff approval process, and institutional arrangements; and (ii) preparation of a comprehensive \nwater tariff study of the three participating countries, including a general review of the water tariff \nstructures and assessment of effectiveness of tariff reforms, a set of national guidelines on \nwater tariffs, and the state implementation framework for India. The study will also include \ndetailed case studies of the five pilot areas. All findings and issues will be discussed at the final \nworkshop, before the finalization of the study. \n \n17.  The TA will engage consultants to work closely with the implementing agencies and the \nlocal and state governments of the five pilot areas. The consultants are required to prepare a \nhigh-quality water tariff study covering the above-mentioned areas and create an effective \nknowledge  dissemination  channel,  including  at  least  eight  workshops  and/or  roundtable \ndiscussions and a final publication of the study to promote knowledge and experience sharing in \nSouth Asia. \n \nC.
