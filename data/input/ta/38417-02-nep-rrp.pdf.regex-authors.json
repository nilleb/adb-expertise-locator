THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Community Irrigation Project. \n \n2.  The project1 will develop or improve small-scale irrigation systems in 12 districts in Nepal \nthrough a community-driven process targeted at the poor, women, and other disadvantaged \ngroups. Small irrigation systems are defined as systems with less than 25 hectares of irrigation \narea in the hills and mountains and less than 200 hectares in the Terai plains. The participating \ndistricts were selected because of their high poverty, food insecurity and irrigation potential. \nThey are Kanchanpur, Kailali, Dang, Kapilvastu in the Terai plains; Doti, Salyan, Rukum, Rolpa, \nPyuthan in the hills; and Bajhang, Jumla, Mugu in the mountains. As the first large-scale \nintervention in small irrigation development in Nepal, the project will demonstrate participatory \nirrigation planning and management and build the capacity of all levels of the government for \nsmall-scale  irrigation  development.  Farmers  will  form  or  strengthen  existing  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) to apply for project support. The project will provide support to rehabilitate \nand build new surface water irrigation schemes and to develop groundwater irrigation through \nshallow tube wells. It will also facilitate access to microfinance support and provide extension \nservices. For farmers without access to electricity who are installing shallow tube wells, the \nproject will connect them to the electricity network. WUAs will in turn learn to manage water \nmore efficiently and equitably, maintain their systems, and apply improved agricultural practices.  \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Food security in Nepal is alarmingly low, with 49% of children under 5 years old stunted, \n25%  severely  stunted,  13%  wasted,  and  3%  severely  wasted.  The  majority  of  small  and \nmarginal farmers cannot achieve their productivity potential since they have unreliable or no \naccess to irrigation water and improved agricultural technology. Small farmers without irrigation \ninclude the disadvantaged Dalit, Janajati and Muslim populations who live and cultivate rain-fed \nland in peripheral water-scarce areas on steep slopes away from fertile and water-rich valleys in \nthe hills and on the fringes of irrigation systems in the plains. Irrigation is key to increasing the \nproduction of staple crops to meet the growing gap between agricultural production and the \nneeds of the expanding population and to diversifying and intensifying agriculture to increase \non-farm incomes, reduce rural poverty, and increase food security. Irrigation therefore has a \ncritical role to play in Nepal\u201es poverty reduction and food security strategies. For individuals and \nhouseholds, access to irrigation reduces the severity of rural poverty by increasing (i) food \nproduction, (ii) on-farm employment, and (iii) incomes.   \n \n4.  The project is in Nepal's confirmed project pipeline for Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nassistance and addresses the three pillars of ADB's country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132012:  \n(i)  broad-based  and  inclusive  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  and  \n(iii) governance and capacity building. It builds on lessons learned from past assistance in the \nagriculture  and  natural  resources  sector 2  and  complements  the  interventions  of  other \ndevelopment  partners.3 The  project supports  the  multisector  approach  advocated  in  ADB's \n                                                \n1  A project preparatory technical assistance grant of $700,000 was provided.  \n2  See Summary Sector Assessment (Appendix 2). \n3  See Development Coordination (Appendix 2). ", "2 \nOperational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, as it aims to improve water productivity, access \nto  microfinance,  and  the  application  of  improved  agricultural  practices. 4  The  project's \ninterventions will be underpinned by associated capacity building at district and community \nlevels.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The expected impact of the \nproject will be to increase the agricultural income of the rural poor and socially disadvantaged \ngroups in Nepal.5 The project will contribute to Nepal's goal of increasing agriculture GDP per \ncapita and the area under irrigation.  \n \n6.  The outcome of the project will be that the poor, women, and other disadvantaged \nfarmers in target communities will intensify and diversify agricultural practices toward higher-\nvalue  crops. With  efficient  utilization,  more reliable  and  available  irrigation  water,  acquired \nirrigated agricultural skills, and better access to production inputs, crop yields are expected to \nincrease by at least 15% in the subprojects within 5 years of construction. The project will add \n17,000 ha (4,000 ha in hills and mountains, and 13,000 ha in the Terai) of improved or new \nirrigated area. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n7.  To achieve its expected outcome, the project will have three outputs: (i) WUAs will \nefficiently manage improved irrigation infrastructure; (ii) participating farmers will apply improved \nagriculture practices and have access to microfinance; and (iii) government capacity to plan and \ncoordinate small-scale irrigation projects will be enhanced. \n \n8.  Improved irrigation infrastructure. The project will respond to requests from WUAs to \nimprove  or  provide  new  small-scale  irrigation  infrastructure.  This  may  include  (i)  the \nrehabilitation and extension of existing farmer-managed or new surface water irrigation systems,  \n(ii) pond or tank systems with reticulated pipe conveyance and distribution systems, (iii) pumped \n(or \u201clift\u201d) irrigation systems, and (iv) shallow tube wells. The project aims to improve water use \nefficiency  and  productivity  within  customary  water  withdrawal  practices  through  improved \nconveyance and use of micro-irrigation and water conservation technologies. The project will \nstrengthen WUAs so they represent all stakeholders within the command area. It will improve \ntheir ability to manage their irrigation systems and cope with socioeconomic changes. WUAs will \nbe helped to prepare water management plans to ensure equitable, adequate, and efficient \ndistribution of irrigation water.  \n \n9.  Improved agriculture practices and access to microfinance. Support will be provided \nto improve farmers' access to inputs and markets, and to enhance their production skills so they \ncan increase their cropping intensity and yields. The project will facilitate access to microcredit \nfor  agricultural  inputs,  irrigation  equipment,  and  irrigation  infrastructure  operation  and \nmaintenance by enabling local microfinance organizations to offer savings and credit services in \nsubproject  areas.  Supplementary  capacity  development  will  be  targeted  at  disadvantaged \ngroups to enable their effective participation. The project will also strengthen links with other \nprograms relevant for their needs. \n                                                \n4 ADB. 2009. Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security.

Government  capacity  building.  Although  the  executing  agency  is  experienced  in \nmanaging rural roads and other local infrastructure projects, and has strong oversight and \nworking relationships with district development committees (DDCs) and their district technical \noffices  (DTOs),  both  the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural \nRoads (DOLIDAR) and the DDCs will be managing small irrigation services on a large-scale \nbasis for the first time. Capacity development will therefore be a major thrust of the project.6 The \nDTOs  will  acquire  new  and  upgraded  skills  in  small-scale  irrigation  design  and  project \nimplementation,  and  DDCs  and  community  leaders  will  learn  how  to  plan  and  manage \nsubproject selection and implementation effectively and transparently and to target activities at \nthe poor, women, and the disadvantaged. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $36.8 million.

Implementation Arrangements \n13.  During  implementation,  the  DDCs  of  the  participating  districts  will  rank  and  select \nparticipating ilaka (subdistricts). Project staff will then work with the leaders of the selected ilaka \nto identify potential subprojects based on agreed selection criteria.7 The subproject selection \nand implementation process is described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).8 \n \n14.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  through  DOLIDAR  will  be  the  executing \nagency for the project. The DDCs and the Rural Microfinance Development Center (RMDC) will \nbe  the  implementing  agencies.  DOLIDAR  will  establish  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU). \nIrrigation engineers will be engaged to enable the DTOs to serve as public engineers and to \nhead the DTO units for Irrigation and Other Infrastructure. For consulting services, one package \nwill be required of a joint venture between a nongovernment organization(s) and an engineering \nfirm(s).  The  consulting  joint  venture  will  assist  the  PCU  at  the  central  level  in  monitoring \nprogress and providing and overseeing preparatory and implementation technical assistance. It \nwill also provide implementation technical assistance at the district and community levels. In \naddition, two consultants will be engaged as individuals. DDCs and their DTOs and the district \nagriculture  development  offices  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  implementation  in  their \nrespective  districts.  Civil  works  will  be  procured  through  a  combination  of  community \nprocurement (through WUAs), shopping, and national competitive bidding. All procurement will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u201fs Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u201fs  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM.9 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n16.  Many  farmer-managed surface  irrigation  systems  suffer from  low  yields  because of \nfragile diversion structures made of earth, logs, or brushwood and frequently washed away by \nfloods and rudimentary distribution systems leading to an unreliable water supply, and high \ndistribution loss and operation and maintenance costs. The project will support the participatory \ndetailed design and construction of infrastructure, including diversion structures, cross-drainage \nworks, improved and extended canal systems, and flood protection facilities to be operated by \nthe WUA. It will not use complex structures requiring expensive materials as repairs may be \nbeyond the means of the community, making such structures unsustainable. Even if they are \nwell designed, complex structures may fail because of poor construction quality, landslides, \nearth tremors, or unusual floods. In contrast, structures built from local materials, although they \nmay regularly suffer damage and require significant labor inputs for maintenance, can generally \nbe  repaired  by  communities  themselves.  The  relative  merits  and  ease  of  maintenance  of \nstructures will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For groundwater irrigation, technology that \nhas proven to be successful in the Terai will be used. The project will ensure that the WUAs are \ninformed about the appropriate technology for installing shallow tube wells and that they are \n                                                \n7  The subproject selection criteria may be found in Annex 2 of the PAM (Appendix 2). \n8  See Annex 1 of the PAM. \n9  PAM (Appendix 2).  \n ", "5 \nable to operate and maintain the pumps. The Nepal Electricity Authority will oversee installation \nof new transformers and the expansion of 11kV line to the shallow tube wells. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  February 2011 \u2013 February 2017 \nEstimated project completion date  28 February 2017 \nProject management \n(i)   Steering Committee  Secretary, Ministry of Local Development (chair) \nJoint Secretary, Ministry of Local Development \nDirector General, DOLIDAR \nDirector General, Department of Agriculture \nDirector General, Department of Irrigation \nDeputy Director General, DOLIDAR \nNational Planning Commission (representative) \nMinistry of Finance (representative) \nCIP Project Coordinator (secretary) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Local Development through DOLIDAR \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  District Development Committees \nRural Microfinance Development Center \n(iv)  Project coordination unit  DOLIDAR, 5 staff \nProcurement  Community  Multiple number of  Variable amounts \nprocurement  contracts \nthrough WUAs \nNational competitive  Multiple number of  Variable amounts \nbidding  contracts \nShopping  Multiple number of  Up to $30,000 \ncontracts \nConsulting services  Joint venture  3,213 person- $5.69 million \npackage  months \nRetroactive financing and/or  One procurement specialist to assist the executing agency in \nadvance contracting  recruiting for each joint venture, for a total of $12,000. \nDisbursementa   The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nCIP = Community Irrigation Project, DOLIDAR = Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural \nRoads, WUA = water users association. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  The economic and financial analyses10 focused on the economic feasibility of the three \nsample subprojects. Quantified benefits were assessed by comparing future \u201cwithout project\u201d \nproduction with the production expected after the introduction of a new or improved and more \nreliable irrigation water supply, the \u201cwith project\u201d case. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) for the three sample surface water subprojects were estimated to be 20.4%, 17.7%, and \n19.1%.  In  general,  the  sensitivity  results  showed  that  the  EIRRs  remain  acceptable  with \nchanges in the main cost and benefit variables. As most of the shallow tube wells will involve \nthe conversion of 100% of the command area from rainfed to irrigated cultivation, the economic \n                                                \n10  See Financial and Economic Analyses (Appendix 2).  \n ", "6 \nanalysis indicates that all shallow tube well schemes would be economically viable, even with \nnew electricity grid connections.  \n \n18.  The project is expected to benefit up to 22,400 farm households, at least 60% of which \nwill have landholdings of less than 1 ha in the Terai or 0.5 ha in the hills and mountains. \nIncremental agricultural production is expected to total 23,200 tons of stable cereal crops and \n29,000 tons of vegetable cash crops. Profits from the improved irrigated crop production can be \nused to finance the long-term operation, maintenance and sustainability of the systems. \n \nC.  Governance \n19.  The project supports local governance, financial and administrative decentralization, and \noversight of public development expenditure by (i) transferring the project's capital investment \nfunds  for  infrastructure  to  the  participating  districts;  (ii)  enhancing  transparency  and \naccountability of public service delivery of small irrigation development by DDCs by identifying \nand  managing  subprojects  by  local  government  units  and  irrigation  communities;  and  \n(iii) building the capacity of WUAs and district governments in financial discipline, responsibility, \ntransparency and accountability. A risk assessment and risk management plan is included in the \nlinked documents.11 The project aims to support the post-conflict approach outlined in the CPS \nby identifying and managing potential conflict risks and opportunities.12 \n \n20.  ADB\u201fs Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith DOLIDAR, and key measures to prevent corruption have been included in the project \ndesign.  These  include  procedures  for  social  audit,  enhanced  oversight  of  civil  works \nprocurement processes, training in anticorruption activities at central, district, and local levels, \nand disclosure of procurement-related information, including contract awards.13 \n \nD.  Poverty, Social and Gender \n21.  Farmers with marginal land holdings of less than 0.5 ha or with less than 1 ha in poor \nareas are targeted as beneficiaries under the project. The targeting criteria of land size and \npoverty incidence correspond to areas with greater numbers of marginalized and poor farmers \nfrom disadvantaged castes and ethnic groups and women farmers. The project will provide \nsupplementary assistance to the poorest and most socially marginalized irrigation users to \nincrease participation and the benefits they receive. Through irrigation improvements, social \nmobilization,  the  provision  of  agricultural  services,  and  facilitation  to  access  microfinance \nservices,  the  project  will  improve  rural  livelihoods  and  boost  agricultural  production.  The \nintensification  of  irrigated  agriculture,  a  shift  from  rain-fed  to  irrigated  agriculture  and  the \nintroduction  of  or  increase  in  vegetable  farming  will  lift  most  marginal  farmers  within  the \nsubproject command areas above the poverty line. The economic analysis conducted for the \nproject pilot subprojects estimated that the project will increase incomes by $100\u2013$300 a year \nfor small and marginal farmers, i.e. those 85-95% of households which have less than 2.5 ha. \nThe project will also contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \ndirectly  by improving food security (MDG1) and indirectly through higher incomes and food \nproduction  (MDGs  2\u20137).  The  landless  poor  will  benefit  only  indirectly  from  irrigation \nimprovements;  however  these  households  will  benefit  from  access  to  microfinance.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2.  \n                                                \n11  See Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n12See  Nepal  Post-Conflict  Sensitive  Approach:  A  Peace Building  Tool  (Peace  Filter)  for  Project  Design  and \nImplementation (Appendix 2). \n13  See also Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n ", "7 \n \n22.  The project is classified as having a gender equity theme. A gender action plan14 has \nbeen made an integral part of the project design and is covered by one of the covenants.  It \nincludes  (i)  gender-sensitive  and  inclusive  procedures  and  provisions  within  WUAs;  \n(ii)  meaningful  consultation  and  participation  of  women  and  consequent  incorporation  of \nwomen\u201fs needs in the system design and other project activities through implementation of the \nconsultation and participation plan;15 (iii) proportionate representation of women in decision \nmaking bodies and processes, training, and project activities; (iv) extra capacity building prior to \nparticipation in training, WUAs, and decision making; (v) equal payment to women for labor (and \nequal treatment for voluntary labor); (vi) a sex-, caste-, and ethnicity-disaggregated monitoring \nand management information system; (vii) subproject-specific application of the gender action \nplan; (viii) microfinance schemes for women that will provide them with access to loans and \nsavings to improve their agricultural livelihoods. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n23.  Environment: Category B. The environmental assessment16 indicates that minimal or \nno significant environmental impacts are expected in most subprojects.  Each subproject is \nsubject to environmental and social screening at the pre-feasibility stage to avoid such adverse \nimpacts  as  encroaching  on  the  habitats  of  endangered  indigenous  peoples,  historical  and \ncultural sites, or protected and ecologically sensitive areas, or locating the system in an area \nwith vulnerable slopes. An environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared. \nIt calls for environmental due diligence to be conducted on all subprojects at the pre-feasibility \nstage, and for an initial environmental examination with an environmental management plan to \nbe prepared for any surface water schemes with a command area of more than 150 ha. For \nsurface water rehabilitation schemes and groundwater cluster schemes, a due diligence report \nwill  be  prepared.  The  list  of  potential  environmental  impacts,  their  mitigation  measures, \ninstitutional arrangements for implementation and monitoring of any environmental management \nplans,  and  the  outlines  for  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental  due \ndiligence report have been described in the environmental assessment and review framework. \nShould an environmental impact assessment be triggered for a particular subproject, it will be \ndropped.  \n \n24.  ADB has assessed the sustainability of water resources and determined that the draw \non both surface water and groundwater under the project is minimal and is not expected to \nsignificantly impact the water balance. A disaster and climate change risks screening17 was \nconducted to assess project exposure to climate-induced risk and natural disasters. Climate \nchange projections indicate that Nepal is more likely to suffer increased drought in future. The \nproject will help farmers adapt to long periods of drought through improved irrigation and water \nuse efficiency in subproject areas. In addition, the project's social mobilization and capacity \ndevelopment  program  will  help  both  farmer  beneficiaries  and  the  project  engineers  better \nunderstand  the  impacts  of  the  environment  on  the  project  and  to  identify  risk  reduction \nmeasures  such  as  on-farm  water  conservation  and  management  and  landslide  control \ntechniques. A greater incidence of flash floods is also expected during the monsoon period. The \nproject will promote flexible irrigation diversion structures and build the technical and financial \ncapacity of the WUAs to maintain the improved irrigation structures. \n \n                                                \n14 Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n15 Consultation and Participation Plan (Appendix 2). \n16  See Environmental Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n17  See Disaster and Climate Change Risks Screen Results (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n25.  Involuntary  Resettlement:  Category  C.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared.18 The  resettlement  framework  covers  small,  community-led  subprojects  with  no \nresettlement and where all land acquisition is voluntary. The selection criteria for a subproject is \nthat irrigation improvement is desired by a community whose members would voluntarily donate \nsmall parcels of their land for the irrigation enhancement. By contributing land for the project \nthey become primary beneficiaries of enhanced irrigation facility.  For each subproject with \nrequirements for new land, procedures have been established to verify that the land is being \nprovided voluntarily by those who stand to gain directly, and to verify that the subproject will \ncause  no  impoverishment  or  displacement  of  tenants  or  bonded  labor.  Resettlement  due \ndiligence will also ensure that meaningful consultation has taken place in good faith with all \naffected  persons,  a  functioning  WUA  for  subproject  implementation  exists,  and  sex-\ndisaggregated  socioeconomic  baseline  data  have  been  collected.  This  resettlement  due \ndiligence will be documented in the subproject feasibility study report. Any subproject requiring \nnonvoluntary land acquisition will be dropped.  \n \n26.  Indigenous  Peoples:  Category  B. An indigenous peoples planning framework has \nbeen prepared based on an analysis of indigenous peoples' impacts and vulnerabilities.19 The \nanalysis  considered  different  categories  of  indigenous  peoples  (endangered,  highly \nmarginalized, marginalized, disadvantaged and advantaged), as well as their traditional rights to \nwater  sources,  land  and forest resources,  and  caste groups  that  do not receive  sufficient \nbenefits under existing arrangements. The inclusion of indigenous peoples in subprojects is \nexpected  to  be  high,  as  the  project  targets  geographically  marginal  rural  areas  where \nindigenous peoples are a majority. The analysis indicated that indigenous peoples in the sample \nsubproject  areas  are  not  vulnerable  according  the  definition  in  ADB\u201fs  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. Therefore it is expected that the project will impact indigenous peoples only in a \npositive way. The project design incorporates many features that will ensure indigenous peoples \nare able to benefit and participate meaningfully. Subprojects are community-driven and will not \nbe prepared unless requested by the community, and unless they meet screening criteria that \ninclude a requirement that the community is able to form an inclusive community mechanism for \nimplementation. The selection criteria will ensure that subprojects will not affect the habitats of \nendangered indigenous peoples and areas where there is a dispute over water user rights. \nIssues of gender, participation and land acquisition are dealt with under the project gender \naction  plan,  the  resettlement  framework,  and  the  consultation  and  participation  plan.  The \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  summarizes  the  strategy  for  participation  and \nrealization  of  project  benefits,  specifically  enhancing  participation  by  indigenous  peoples, \nscreening  for  negative  impacts  and  ensuring  benefits,  institutional  arrangements,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 \n \n                                                \n18  See Involuntary Resettlement Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n19  See Indigenous Peoples Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n20  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPublic Financial Management.
