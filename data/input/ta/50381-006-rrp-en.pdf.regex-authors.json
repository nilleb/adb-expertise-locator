THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Highway \nModernization Project. \n \n2.  The project will (i) construct a new four-lane expressway between Bago (Bago region) and \nKyaikto (Mon state) of about 64 kilometers (km) along the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nEast\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC);1 (ii) build the government\u2019s capacity to develop and \nmanage expressways that meet international standards; and (iii) ensure road safety in the Bago\u2013\nKyaikto corridor. The project will benefit poor, rural residents in the  Bago\u2013Kyaikto corridor by \nproviding climate-resilient, safe, and more efficient connectivity between Bago and Kyaikto, and \nto other destinations in the EWEC. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context and impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic. Since \n2012 when the Government of Myanmar decided to reengage with the international community \nand initiated structural reforms, Myanmar has been aiming to achieve sustained economic growth \nthrough  the  market  economy,  with  strong  growth  averaging  6.4%  in  2015 2019.  In  2020, \n\u2014\nhowever, despite a moderate but recently increasing number of confirmed coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) cases, disruptions to key economic sectors and to trade and investment flows stand \nto derail its growth trajectory, down from an original estimate of 6.8% to 1.8%, equivalent to \neconomic losses of $3.3 billion. COVID-19 may also slow Myanmar\u2019s significant progress in \npoverty reduction because large poor and vulnerable populations are least able to cope. Job \nlosses, including those for returning migrants, are estimated at 1.2 million\ua7f72.1 million, and the \nnumber of the poor is likely to increase by 1.3 million.2 There are concerns that job losses may \nincrease due to continued slowdown in Thailand and other economies. The project is expected to \nassist Myanmar\u2019s post COVID-19 economic recovery by helping to create jobs through increased \nroad transport efficiency and providing support for integrated and sustainable economic growth.  \n \n4.  Transport sector issues and opportunities. A key ingredient of the government\u2019s \nstrategy for economic growth has been to modernize the country\u2019s transport system. Increasing \ninfrastructure investments especially improving its highway network will enable Myanmar to take \nfull advantage of its geographical location in the region and global value chains and realize its \ngrowth potential.3 However, Myanmar\u2019s transport infrastructure has lagged behind the rest of \nSoutheast Asia because of inadequate investment. Myanmar invested only about 1% of its gross \ndomestic  product  during  2005\u20132018  in  transport  infrastructure,  while  faster-growing  Asian \ncountries invested about 3%. In 2017, the government estimated that 14 million people in \nMyanmar lived in villages that are physically isolated because there is no connecting road, or \nbecause the road is flooded or becomes muddy during the rainy season.  \n \n5.  To hasten and leverage government investment, the Ministry of Construction (MOC) had \ncontracted 26 private concessionaires to manage and improve the main highways, about 5,545 \n \n1  The GMS corridors comprise a number of corridors, including the EWEC. The EWEC runs from Viet Nam through \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Thailand to Myanmar, linking economic centers in the GMS. \n2  ADB. 2020. Proposed Countercyclical Support Facility Loan Republic of the Union of Myanmar: COVID-19 Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program. Manila; ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Supplement. Manila.  \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014. Myanmar: Unlocking the Potential. Country Diagnostic Study. Manila. \n ", " \n2 \nkm in total. However, the concession arrangements currently in place have had mixed results \nbecause of limited MOC capacity to manage concessionaires including ineffective concession \nagreements, low toll revenues, and poor execution of operation and maintenance (O&M).4 The \nhigh risk of not being able to induce sufficient traffic for large capital investments has also made \nit  difficult  to  attract  upfront  private  sector  investments.  The  experience  indicates  that  an \nincremental approach which takes into account the capacity of the MOC and the risk of the traffic \nlevel should be pursued, starting with improving O&M arrangements where feasible. \n \n6.   In 2012, the government removed restrictions on vehicle imports, resulting in gradually \nincreased traffic on the road network. This has led to growing congestion as well as to faster road \ndeterioration, resulting in a shorter useful road life, where a study estimated that only 71% of the \nnational highways are paved.5 The government plans to increase transport investments to 3% of \ngross domestic product by 2030 by refocusing on the main corridors and ensuring adherence to \ninternational design standards to keep road conditions in a fair to good condition for the roads\u2019 \nuseful life for passenger safety. Government objectives outlined in the National Transport Sector \nDevelopment Master Plan and the Master Plan for Arterial Road Network Development in \nMyanmar  provide  guidance  for  long-term  investments. 6 The  government\u2019s  strategy  is  to \nmodernize and improve management of the existing highway network and to develop an arterial \nhighway network on straighter alignments for a more efficient transportation, while avoiding \nsettled areas. \n \n7.  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  corridors.  The  GMS  corridors  are  the  backbone  of \nMyanmar\u2019s transport system. The EWEC in particular connects Da Nang in Viet Nam with Yangon \nand its special economic zone of Thilawa, and further west to Pathein. The sections of the EWEC \nin Thailand, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam have been completed based \non international standards, with improved border facilities. Improvements in connectivity between \nBago and Kyaikto along the EWEC will reduce national transport costs within Myanmar and \nimprove regional connectivity with Thailand and onwards to the rest of the GMS.7 About 3,000\u2013\n11,000 vehicles per day used the segment of the EWEC in Myanmar in 2017. The traffic volume \nhas been increasing since 2012, and the Myanmar segment of the EWEC is likely to reach its full \ncapacity of about 15,000 vehicles per day about 2025-2030 (footnotes 3 and 5). \n \n8.  Road safety. Most of the road corridors in Myanmar, including those in the EWEC, have \nonly two lanes, with pavement condition ranging from poor to fair. Road safety is a serious issue, \nand Myanmar\u2019s crash fatality rate is among the highest in Southeast Asia with 21 fatalities per \n100,000 inhabitants with 95% of fatalities attributable to road user behavior errors.8 Alignments \nof existing roads go through populated areas. Low design standards together with a mix of road \nusers (motorized and nonmotorized vehicles, pedestrians, and animals) make it unsafe for vehicle \nspeeds greater than 60 km per hour.  \n \n9.  Pro-poor focus of the project. The Bago\u2013Kyaikto corridor across the Bago region and \nMon state has higher poverty rate (31.0%) than the national average (24.8%). Poverty is further \n \n4   ADB. 2016. Myanmar Transport Sector Policy Note: How to Reform Transport Institutions. Manila. \n5  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2020.

Geneva. \n ", " \n3 \naggravated by the fact that people living in rural areas along the EWEC, including those living \nalong the Bago\u2013Kyaikto corridor, cannot fully benefit from road connections because of the limited \nrural road network. In the Bago region and Mon state where the project will be located, the \ngovernment estimates that 1.4 million people have inadequate rural road access.9 In addition, \nthese areas are also prone to floods, exasperated by climate change, damaging existing roads. \nFloods also prevent road access or result in only seasonal access, as shown by the severe flood \nof July 2017 which inundated the  Bago\u2013Kyaikto road, limiting its access for three days. The \nproject will enhance connectivity along the segment of the EWEC between Bago and Kyaikto, \nthus benefiting the Bago region and Mon state through increased trade, tourism, and investment \nactivities with other GMS countries, particularly Thailand, by bringing producers and consumers \ncloser to markets and creating employment and income opportunities for people living on both \nsides of the border. In addition, about 70,000 residents along the proposed alignment will benefit \nfrom access roads to be paved under the project (about 25 km), which will provide direct and \nclimate-resilient access to the newly constructed expressway and other existing roads. \n \n10.  The government\u2019s sector strategy and the role of the proposed project. The project \nwill help the government with its long-term objective to develop an arterial highway network, which \nis essential to achieving rapid economic growth. In line with the government\u2019s Master Plan for \nArterial Road Network Development in Myanmar (footnote 6), which includes the proposed Bago\u2013\nKyaikto expressway, the construction of about 560 km of arterial highways has already begun. \nAnother 3,290 km of arterial highways are planned to be constructed during 2020\u20132030. The \narterial  highway  development  program  accounts  for  half  of  Myanmar\u2019s  long-term  transport \ninvestment needs.  \n \n11.  The project will improve the capacity of the Bago\u2013Kyaikto section of the EWEC, where the \ncurrent two-lane road has high traffic volumes (para. 7). A prefeasibility study prepared by the \nJapan international Cooperation Agency (JICA) indicates that this section would reach capacity \nsometime between 2025 and 2030. Upgrading the existing road is not the preferred solution \nbecause its widening would involve large resettlement impacts, and the alignment of the existing \nroad is long and winding in several areas. The proposed project will construct a new, four-lane \nBago\u2013Kyaikto expressway that is 32 km shorter than the current segment of the EWEC. It will \nhalve the current travel time of 110 minutes between Bago and Kyaikto and provide all-year \naccess to townships in the project area.  \n \n12.  COVID-19 Recovery through the Project. Creating sustained recovery opportunities will \nbe critical. Strengthening road connectivity can play an important role on this front, as the \nproposed expressway will reduce transport time and costs; open new economic and employment \nopportunities through linkages to new markets and production centers; and increase the local \npopulation\u2019s access to health, education, and other social services. In the short-term, the project \nitself will create significant construction and other ancillary jobs. Several micro, small and medium-\nsized enterprises in the construction value chain will be supported. Over the medium to long-term, \nthere is a strong link between improved transport and poverty reduction for inclusive growth. \nFurthermore, improved accessibility to local and regional markets through better roads increases \nopportunities for women to participate in the labor market. \n  \n \n9  Government of Myanmar. 2017.

Lessons learned. The project builds on ADB\u2019s past and ongoing experience with road \nprojects in Myanmar and incorporates the following lessons from such interventions, as reflected \nin  the  project  design:  (i)  providing  road  access  with  pavement  surfacing  suitable  for  local \nchallenges and conditions; (ii) improving the capacity of the local contracting industry in deciding \npackage size  for contracts; (iii) ensuring that the project is implemented in a timely manner by \nmanaging environment and resettlement safeguards issues efficiently during project planning; (iv) \nenhancing road safety for expressway ramps at designated intercity bus stops; and (v) enhancing \nproject readiness of future projects through fast-tracked detailed design prepared under an \nongoing loan (footnote 21), based on continuous discussions with the borrower. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: an arterial highway network established \nin support of economic development, regional economic growth, and international industrial \ncompetitiveness in a way that is safe, environmentally friendly, and efficient. The project will have \nthe following outcome: more efficient and safer movement of goods and people between Bago \nand Kyaikto along the GMS EWEC.11  \n \n16.  Output 1: New Bago\u2013Kyaikto expressway constructed. The project will construct \nabout 64 km of four-lane expressway between Bago and Kyaikto. The new expressway will \nprovide an alternate route between Bago and Kyaikto, shortening the current distance by 32 km \nand simultaneously providing climate-resilient access for this flood-prone area. The proposed \nexpressway is also the first greenfield expressway in Myanmar and will be fully access controlled. \nA 2.3 km New Sittaung Bridge across the Sittaung River is proposed to be constructed under \nJICA\u2019s parallel cofinancing loan, not administered by ADB.12 The construction supervision and \nimplementation support (CSIS) consultant to be financed by ADB will help the Department of \nHighways under the MOC and the project management unit (PMU) implement the project. \n \n10 ADB. 2019.

Output 3: Road safety for Bago\u2013Kyaikto corridor improved. This output will focus on \nimproving safety along the project corridor, building on the road safety program being finalized \nunder an ongoing technical assistance (TA) that focuses on establishing a foundation for a \nsustainable  road  safety  regime  for  Myanmar.  This  output  will  (i)  implement  an  innovative \ncommunity-based road safety program, focusing on road user education and social enforcement \nto achieve a sustainable long-term safe environment for road users and the local community; (ii) \ninclude the essential road safety engineering elements in the detailed design; and (iii) implement \ninnovative safety measures (see Box in para. 20) during construction phase together with road \nsafety education for consultants and contractors. Equipment necessary for the MOC to improve \nroad safety will be procured under the project.15  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  Since 2012, transport has been a main pillar of ADB\u2019s reengagement strategy in Myanmar. \nADB\u2019s strategy has focused on the GMS corridors and on rural\u2013urban links.16 ADB has financed \nroad improvement projects in the Ayeyarwady delta and on the Eindu\u2013Kawkareik section of the \nEWEC.17 ADB has also prepared a strategic review of the transport sector and provided TA to \nreform sector institutions and build their capacity in road asset management and safety.18 It also \nprovided assistance to prepare the National Strategy for Rural Roads and Access (footnote 9). \nCurrently, through its Office of Public-Private Partnership (OPPP), ADB is supporting the MOC \nwith its public\u2013private partnership (PPP) capacity, including designing more effective concession \narrangements. As a result, the MOC has initiated application of road asset management tools in \nthe DOH, while the Ministry of Transport and Communications has implemented its Myanmar \nrailways reform agenda in its first project for ADB financing.19 ADB is also supporting the MOC to \nincrease private sector participation in sustainable O&M activities, through assistance in drafting \nconcession agreements with sustainability objectives.20 \n \n \n13 ADB. 2016.

The government has requested ADB\u2019s further assistance in developing the country\u2019s main \nroad corridors, particularly the EWEC, and improve their management. As the first response, in \n2018, ADB approved the GMS Highway Modernization Project to address traffic demand up to \n2025.21 The GMS Highway Modernization Project included the preparation and rehabilitation of \nthe Yangon\u2013Pathein and Bago\u2013Thilawa sections of the EWEC, which were in poor condition. \nADB also approved a rural roads project in 2019, which will allow rural residents in Ayeyarwady \nand Magway regions to use a national highway year-round.22 With the long-term vision and \nrelationship with the government, it has requested ADB to support this first greenfield expressway \nin Myanmar. The design fully takes into account the government\u2019s lack of experience (para. 5) \nand has drawn from ADB\u2019s experience in other Asian countries, including expressway projects in \nViet Nam, and builds on the policy dialogue between ADB and the government on the transport \nsector, together with PPP capacity-building activity for the MOC through ADB\u2019s OPPP.23 24 The \nproject will also generate a synergy with a proposed GMS: Cross-Border Livestock Health and \nValue Chains Improvement Project, now under preparation. The noteworthy features of the \nproject are summarized below. \n \nBox: Noteworthy Features of the Project \n\u2022  The project areas have higher poverty incidence 31% than the national average 24%, with a \npopulation density of 146 persons per square km almost twice as high as the national level of 76. \nThe project during construction as well as during its life will bring highly pro-poor benefits. \n\u2022  Myanmar will be able to deepen its share in the agriculture and other value chains, of average 23% \nof annual GDP, through greater regional trade broadly in GMS and particularly between Myanmar \nand Thailand, about $3 billion in 2019 with expected yearly average increase of 40%. \n\u2022  With traffic demand forecast to rise sharply, as seen over 3-fold increase between 2012\u20132018, there \nwill be a serious deterioration of the traffic environment. The project will address these issues by \nconstructing the access-controlled expressway that meets quality infrastructure principles, including \nclimate resilience and introducing noise barriers and 102 underpasses to ensure residents\u2019 mobility. \n\u2022  Construction methods that are new to Myanmar (for example, Incremental Loading Method) will be \npursued for soft-soil treatment, which will also enhance climate resilience. \n\u2022  Road safety will be of paramount concern and focus, with third worst fatality rate in southeast Asia, \nintroducing real-time surveillance and emergency response systems. More women (at least 50%) \nwill be involved in and benefit from road safety awareness training. \n\u2022  With the expected spike in trade and logistics promotion, as shown above, it is vital to improve asset \nmanagement capacity\u2014another focus area of the project. \n\u2022  Project aims to propose a sustainable O&M model for toll highways for the MOC to increase private \nsector participation, including possible PPP arrangements, which are also replicable for ongoing toll \nroad concession agreements. Secured toll booths will be built.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $526.3 million (Table 2). The government has requested \na concessional loan of $483.8 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nproject, of which $50.0 million is provided from the regional set-aside. The government will provide \nthe equivalent of $42.5 million to finance interest during construction and resettlement. The loan \nwill have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year \n \n21 ADB. 2018.

The  MOC  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  DOH  under  the  MOC  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The DOH has established a PMU which will be responsible for the day-to-\nday management of the project. The PMU will be headed by a full-time project director of chief \nengineer level and three subproject directors of director level, and will be staffed with engineering, \nfinancial, administrative, and safeguards specialists. The PMU (with detailed design office) will be \nbased in Yangon with one office in Bago. \n \n24.  The MOC and ADB have initiated advance actions to improve project readiness. Under \nan ongoing loan (footnote 21), selection for an international consulting firm is ongoing for detailed \nengineering design of the civil works contracts under output 1. A CSIS consultant will be engaged \n ", " \n8 \nthrough  an  international  consulting  firm  to  supervise  all  civil  works,  monitor  safeguards \nimplementation, and support project management. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangement \nAspects  Arrangement \nImplementation period  January 2021\u2013March 2027 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 September 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Planning Finance and Industry \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Construction \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Department of Highways \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit, Yangon, 29 staff \nProcurement and consulting  Open competitive bidding  1 contract with 5 lots  $422.88 million \nservices  QCBS (90:10)  1,236 person-months  $13.95 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be sought for construction supervision and \nimplementation support consulting services \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The technical due diligence undertaken during project preparation confirmed that the \nproject\u2019s technical designs are appropriate for roads in the project locations, including alignment, \ncross-sections, structural characteristics, soft soil treatment, road safety provisions, and projected \ntraffic volume. Appropriate measures have been identified to improve climate and disaster \nresilience (para. 40). Pavement structures of the proposed four-lane expressway have been \nselected to enable a 10-year useful life for asphalt concrete, with 100-year flood (a flood with a \n100 year frequency) applied for all river crossings and for all major drainage structures. The \nunderlying traffic projection is based on present traffic volumes, with growth rates that consider \nthe likely rapid increase in traffic expected as Myanmar\u2019s economy continues to develop. All \nmaterials used in road construction are locally procured except for bitumen, road signs, road \nfurniture, noise barriers, and reinforcement steel in concrete. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  Economic viability. The project is economically viable. The main benefits of the project \nunder output 1 are reduced vehicle operating costs and shorter travel times. The project will also \nlikely generate road safety cost savings under output 3. The overall economic internal rate of \nreturn of the project is estimated to be 14.9%.25 In addition, as a part of the GMS EWEC, the \nproject provides one of the last-mile transport links to Thailand, with expected increased trade in \ngoods, tourism, and investment. \n \n27.  Financial viability. It is anticipated that with a new O&M scheme to be implemented under \noutput 2, the project will generate revenue from revised tariffs and increased traffic volumes. The \nrevenue, however, is expected not to be sufficient to cover the significant capital investments, and \nboth the financial net present value (NPV) and financial internal rate of return for the project are \nnegative. But the NPV during the O&M period is still greater than the total O&M costs of the \n \n25 This takes into consideration the New Sittaung Bridge, to be financed by JICA\u2019s parallel cofinancing loan. \n ", " \n9 \nproject, which suggests that the minimum conditions for operational and financial sustainability \nare achievable with an enhanced expressway O&M scheme. This new O&M scheme will be a \nPPP structured to ensure financial sustainability. ADB is also supporting the MOC\u2019s efforts to \nsecure private sector participation for sustainable O&M activities, including the draft of concession \nagreements. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  Under MOC\u2019s current O&M scheme, the sustainability of the project would depend on \ngeneral  budget  appropriations  for  road maintenance,  which  are for  those  roads  not  under \nconcessions. The DOH receives fiscal allocations of about $125 million annually from the central \nand regional governments for road O&M. This allocation is considered sufficient to maintain \ncurrent road and traffic conditions; however, there is a risk of an increased maintenance backlog. \nStrengthening the capacity of the MOC as an institution which operates the wider road network in \nMyanmar and enhancing the expressway and toll road management scheme, including revising \nand updating toll fees, are critical to support the long-term operational efficiency and financial \nsustainability of the new project expressway. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  Procurement. Strategic procurement planning was carried out to identify procurement \nrisks, develop mitigating measures, review procurement options, and agree on fit-for-purpose \nprocurement arrangements. The procurement risk is rated high since the DOH lacks capability \nand  will  depend  on  international  consultants  for  the  preparation  of  the  detailed  design, \nprocurement, and project implementation support. The capacity development in procurement will \nbe provided by the consultant through day-to-day assistance and trainings. Value for money will \nbe achieved by (i) selecting the CSIS consultant through advance action under the quality- and \ncost-based selection method with 90% weight assigned to quality; and (ii) procuring the civil works \npackage through open competitive bidding, where one civil works contract is split into five lots, \ntaking into account engineering considerations and the size and complexity of road sections, and \nwhere bidders are permitted to bid for a single lot or combination of lots based on their technical \ncapacity and availability of financial resources. \n \n30.  Institutional capacity. The procurement management risk is rated high. Although the \nDOH has made progress, it is still dependent on international consultants for implementation \nsupport for ongoing projects. Capacity development will be continued under the proposed project \nwith consultant support, initially through day-to-day assistance and trainings. In parallel to the \nproject, ADB will strengthen the DOH\u2019s capacity in safeguards, procurement, and contract \nmanagement through day-to-day assistance and capacity-building workshops. \n \n31.  Financial management. The premitigation financial management risk is substantial, \nmainly because of weaknesses in government-wide financial management systems and limited \ncapacity of the DOH in financial reporting, and internal audit. Through the strengthened PMU, the \nDOH will manage project financial management arrangements, including implementation of \nproject-specific financial management actions to mitigate the risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOC. \nThe specific policy requirements, proposed risk mitigating actions, and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual. 26 \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " \n10 \n32.  Poverty. The average poverty rate of four townships (Bago, Waw, Thanatpin, and Kyaikto) \nclose to the proposed road is 31.0%, higher than the national average of 24.8% for Myanmar in \n2017.27 While the average national poverty rate fell significantly from 32.1% in 2015 to 24.8% in \n2017, the decline in poverty rate in the project areas was marginal in the same period. The total \nnumber of households that will be directly benefited by the project is estimated to be 13,100 with \nabout 69,000 people, 52% of whom are women. The new road will halve the travel time (currently \n110 minutes) between Bago and Kyaikto, facilitate the transport of commodities, and promote \neconomic development of the project states and GMS. Further, direct poverty alleviation benefits \nof the project are expected to derive from improved access to services (such as health and \neducation), employment opportunities, and markets. Indirect poverty alleviation will result from \nthe project\u2019s contribution to economic development through lower transport costs resulting from \nreduced travel times and vehicle operating costs. \n \n33.  Gender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements  for  gender \nmainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared to identify specific programs and activities \nwhere participation of women can be promoted.28 The project will address marginalization of \nwomen in training through specific targets for women in project training activities. For villages in \nthe project areas, participation of women will be actively promoted in consultation activities, \nHIV/AIDS, and the Human Trafficking Awareness and Prevention Program (footnote 26), as well \nas livelihood restoration activities for households affected by land acquisition. The participation of \nwomen  in  capacity  development  programs  in  government  agencies  responsible  for  project \nimplementation  and  operation  will  also  be  ensured  through  targets  in  training  for  project \nmanagement and crash data collection and analysis provided under outputs 1 and 3. The project \nwill also mitigate risks to women posed during the construction period. Risks of sexual harassment \nand gender-based violence will be reduced through grievance redress mechanisms that are \naccessible and oriented towards women, as well as public awareness campaigns on what \nconstitutes gender-based violence and sexual harassment and where women can go for support. \n \n34.  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The project could face increased risks of HIV/AIDS \nand sexually transmitted infections as well as human trafficking. The risks are associated with the \nconstruction phase as a result of the influx of construction workers and camp followers (including \nsex workers) and low levels of awareness of risk prevention, as well as during the operation phase \nof the completed project because of increased mobility. To mitigate these risks, the project will \nimplement the Human Trafficking Awareness and Prevention Program. The program will be \nimplemented by a service provider under the CSIS consultant. The main activities of the program \nwill include (i) raising awareness of local communities and high-risk groups using behavioral \nchange communication, (ii) improving access to medical services, (iii) raising the capacities of the \nstakeholders, and (iv) mobilizing local peer educators. The civil works contractors will be required \nto provide HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention training for their workers. \n \n35.  Safe working under COVID-19 conditions. The impact of COVID-19 is evolving, and the \nimplementation of the project will be responsive and flexible in meeting emerging needs and new \nguidance. The project will strictly follow government guidance on safe working in COVID-19 \nconditions, adhering to the most robust medical and scientific advice. The project parties will be \nrequired to incorporate emerging international construction best practice on distancing (where \npractical for works of this nature), implementation methodologies, effective use of forced air \nventilation systems, and personal protective equipment. This is vital for work in deep trench and \nother confined spaces, where the risk of transmission is high. \n \n \n27 ADB. 2018. Poverty and Social Analysis 2019.

None of the project areas are directly conflict affected. \nThe project will benefit all communities in a fair, unbiased, and equal manner. Improving the \ntransport connectivity along the GMS EWEC will increase employment and income opportunities \nin the project areas, states and regions along the EWEC including Kayin state,  as well as in other \nparts of the country through increased trade and business activities, which in turn could foster \ngrowth and reduce poverty.29 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n38.  Environment (category A). An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared \nand uploaded to the ADB website on 2 September 2019.31 The project alignment has been \nselected to minimize environmental impacts by traversing primarily agricultural land classified as \nhighly modified habitat and avoiding encroachment on legally protected sites. Without mitigation \nmeasures, construction impacts could be significant. Properly licensed quarrying sites will need \nto be identified to source construction materials for the elevated highway embankment. An action \nplan has been prepared to address possible adverse impacts on biodiversity, primarily the \ncatastrophic loss of containment, and reduce pollution during the construction and operation of \nthe  New  Sittaung  Bridge,  which  could  affect  water  quality  of  the  Sittaung  River  and  the \ndownstream  Gulf  of  Mottama  Ramsar  site.32 Other  anticipated  impacts  during construction \ninclude fugitive dust, temporary traffic disturbance, and occupational and community safety at \nconstruction sites. Adherence to the environmental management plan will reduce the residual \nimpact to acceptable levels. During operations, the project\u2019s impact on ambient air quality is not \nanticipated to be significant, but around 10 km of noise barriers at 19 identified sensitive sites will \nbe required. \n \n39.  Traffic safety will be strengthened through a community-based road safety program (para. \n18). The capacity of the PMU, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the environmental \nmanagement plan, will be strengthened with new environment staff, supervision consultants, and \nan independent environmental monitor. Meaningful public consultation was carried out during the \nEIA preparation to inform the project design and environmental assessment process. A grievance \nredress mechanism has also been defined. \n \n40.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  a  medium  climate  risk,  mainly  an  increase  in \nprecipitation and floods.33 Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $10.7 million, mainly to address \nclimate-sensitive facilities, including road embankments, bridges and underpasses, and road \ndrainage facilities. \n \n41.  Involuntary resettlement (category A) and indigenous peoples (category B). The \nproject has been categorized A for involuntary resettlement and B for indigenous peoples in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  During  the  feasibility  study, \n \n29 Conflict Sensitivity Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 ADB.

An updated EIA, \nreflecting comments received from the Environment Conservation Department of Myanmar, was disclosed in April \n2020. \n32 The New Sittaung Bridge to be financed by JICA\u2019s non-ADB-administered parallel cofinancing will be classified as \nan associated facility per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and has been assessed through a separate EIA. \nKey findings of the New Sittaung Bridge EIA are reflected in the EIA of the proposed project (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). A Ramsar site is a wetland site assessed as internationally significant under the \nRamsar Convention established by UNESCO. \n33 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " \n12 \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts were assessed, and a resettlement plan has been prepared.34 \nThe project requires acquisition of 502.79 hectares (ha) of land (442.54 ha of private land and \n60.25 ha of state land). The project will affect 447 households (2,441 people), out of which 32 \nhouseholds are non-titleholders living within the existing MOC right-of-way. The project requires \nrelocation of 64 households (306 people). \n \n42.  In addition to the resettlement plan, a separate ethnic group development plan (EGDP) \nhas been prepared. No ethnic group households will be affected by land acquisition or experience \nother severe impacts. The EGDP ensures that ethnic groups in the project areas (about 2%) \nparticipate equitably in consultations and benefit from mitigation programs and project benefits. \nThe DOH will implement the EGDP with the support of the CSIS consultants. The EGDP and the \nresettlement plan have been endorsed by the DOH for public disclosure on the ADB website. \n \n43.  ADB  has  discussed  with  JICA  the  effective  harmonization  of  safeguards  policies, \nprovisions, specific resettlement entitlements, and unit costs for compensation. It is agreed that \nthe DOH will ensure consistency of compensation provisions for both JICA- and ADB-financed \nproject facilities. ADB has clarified with the DOH that the income restoration strategy, set out in \nthe resettlement plan, is mandatory. This will ensure that the livelihoods of severely affected \nhouseholds will be fully restored. The income restoration program is to be implemented by a \nspecialized local agency. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n44.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInitial  project  start-up  delays  (such  as  consultant  The recruitment of CSIS consultant has been initiated \nselection,  and  contract  awards)  occur  in  project  under advance action before loan negotiations. \nimplementation. \nThe military unexpectedly occupies private land along the  Based on the alignment finalized in August 2019, the MOC \nalignment.  has initiated and engaged in the lengthy process to freeze \naffected land (ongoing). \nWeak  government  capacity  in  procurement,  contract  The  proposed  project  will  minimize  the  number  of \nmanagement,  financial  management,  and  safeguards  contracts, set up project FM system, and strengthen PMU \ncompliance affects project implementation progress.  capacity through training and day-to-day assistance by \nCSIS consultant and ADB. \nExtreme weather events delay civil works or require an  For weather events, status will be closely monitored and \nincrease in the scope of works and COVID-19 impacts  the CSIS consultants may be required to design additional \nadversely on the contractor\u2019s workforce, subcontractors,  works.
