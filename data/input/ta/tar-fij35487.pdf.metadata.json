During  the  Country  Consultation  Mission  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in \nSeptember  2001,  the  Government  of  the  Fiji  Islands  requested  ADB  to  provide  technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare a proposal for a rural electrification project. The TA is included in the \n2002 country strategy and program. The Fact-Finding Mission visited the Fiji Islands in March \n2002  and  reached  an  understanding  on  the  TA\u2019s  rationale,  purpose  and  output,  terms  of \nreference, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements with the Government and the \nconcerned agencies. The logical framework is attached as Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  long-term  objective  of  the  country\u2019s  rural  electrification  policy  is  to  provide \ncontinuous electricity to all potential electricity consumers in the Fiji Islands. Prior to 1993, the \nrural electrification program was implemented by the Public Works Department (PWD) based on \na cost-sharing arrangement (consumers cater for 1/3 of the cost, the Government pays the \n2/3rds); and by other Government agencies on full-cost subsidy arrangement (i.e., consumers \npay no part of the cost) with funds obtained on an ad hoc basis, through aid agencies. During \n1975 to 1992, 203 electrification schemes were installed. The Government owned the schemes \nand had the obligation to maintain and eventually replace them. However, the connection policy \nwas uncoordinated and unplanned and, with restricted budgetary allocations, the Government \nwas not able to maintain these services.2 \n \n3.  In  order  to  achieve  consistency  in  the  connection  policy  and  sustainability  in  the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of the rural electrification supply, the Government approved \na new rural electrification policy in 1993. The Rural Electrification Unit was created within the \nDepartment  of  Energy  (DOE)3  with  responsibility  to  administer  and  control  the  rural \nelectrification  program.  With  the  new  system,  each  village  or  settlement  requiring  rural \nelectrification assistance contributes 10% and the Government subsidizes 90% of the total \ncapital cost. The village/settlement owns the electrification scheme and, after a grace period of \nthree  years,4  it  becomes  responsible  for  its  maintenance.  The  rural  electrification  policy \ncontemplates  different  options  for  electrification,  including  (i)  Fiji  Electricity  Authority  (FEA) \nconnection to the grid; (ii) Government station connection; (iii) stand-alone diesel; and (iv) \nrenewable energy based schemes such as hydro, solar, and biomass. Since the adoption of the \n1993 rural electrification policy, 454 rural communities throughout the Fiji Islands were provided \nwith  electricity  services,  mostly  stand-alone  diesel  (48.2%)  and  FEA  connection  (46.9%) \nschemes.5 \n \n4.  There is a growing demand for 24 hour electricity and backup facilities to guide the \nschemes  toward  sustainable  operations.  However,  the  Rural  Electrification  Unit  remains \nunderstaffed6  and  underfinanced.  This  reduces  dramatically  the  effectiveness  of  the  rural \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 24 May 2002. \n2  The average cost to maintain the service was about F$1,600 per scheme per annum. \n3  DOE is part of the Ministry of Works, Telecommunications, Energy, Road Transport, and Shipping. \n4  During  the  grace  period  the  Government  is  responsible  for  (i)  maintenance/repairs  of  the  project;  (ii)  the \nestablishment of a management structure within the village for the project; and (iii) basic technical training to village \noperators on the operational, maintenance, and repair schemes.  \n5  In the FEA connection scheme, the Rural Electrification Unit commissions the scheme to FEA, then FEA provides \nelectricity and charges the users with the national tariff. \n6  The unit has only two staff, who are on loan from DOE. ", "2 \nelectrification program and constrains the Government\u2019s effort to increase basic services and \nreduce the extent of poverty in the rural areas of the Fiji Islands. \n \n5.  There  is  a  strong  preference  among  the  external  funding  community  to  promote \nrenewable energy sources in the Fiji Islands. ADB is not the only assistance agency assisting \nthe  Fiji  Islands  in  developing  renewable  energy  supply.  Coordination  among  funders  is \nimportant  to  complement  and  build  synergies  and  avoid  duplication.  DOE  is  currently \nimplementing  a  project  funded  by  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  and  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP).  The  project  aims  to  improve  the  current  institutional \nstructure and allow the involvement/establishment of renewable energy service companies in \nrural areas. The project will be completed in August 2003. Furthermore, the Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is considering assisting the Government in \nreviewing the 1993 Rural Electrification policy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The TA will establish a development strategy and investment plan for rural electrification \nwith special emphasis on optimizing extension of the FEA electrical grid, building new diesel-\npower  capacity,  and  providing  renewable  energy  supply  (e.g.,  micro-hydro,  biomass,  solar \nphotovoltaic,  and  hybrid  systems).  The  TA  will  assess  the  social,  institutional,  and \nenvironmental  aspects  of  rural  electrification,  and  recommend  appropriate  development \nstrategies. It will also identify and carry out a feasibility study and develop a rural electrification \nproject suitable for financing by ADB and other external funding agencies, and assess its long-\nterm sustainability. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will consist of (i) a full review of the rural electrification supply in the Fiji Islands, \n(ii) prioritization of rural energy development strategy and investment plans to reduce poverty, \nand (iii) preparation of a project suitable for financing by ADB and/or other agencies. The TA will \nbe implemented in two phases. \n \n8.  Phase I will (i) review the relevant studies of rural electrification in the Fiji Islands; (ii) \nassess the strengths and weaknesses of the present arrangement and suggest improvements; \n(iii) propose institutional improvement suitable to ensure efficient implementation of the rural \nelectrification sector; (iv) forecast rural electrification demand; (v) formulate a long-term least-\ncost investment program that will meet the assessed demand and will maximize economic, \nsocial, and poverty impact; and (vi) in close consultation with stakeholders, formulate a realistic \nfive-year investment plan for extension of electricity supply through expansion of the grid system \nand construction of new generation systems, including diesel and renewable energy supply. \n \n9.  Based on the results of phase I, phase II will develop a rural electrification project \nsuitable for external financing. Phase II will (i) identify the highest priority components of the \nproject for ADB financing in terms of poverty impact; (ii) prepare a feasibility level design for the \nproject, include scope, components, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and O&M \nprocedures; (iii) undertake a detailed socioeconomic survey, initial environmental examination, \nresettlement plan (if needed), and financial and economic evaluation of the project; (iv) assess \nthe implementation capacity and future O&M capacity, and willingness/ability to pay for the \nservice;  and  (v)  propose  institutional  improvement  (including  private  sector  participation) ", "    3 \nsuitable to ensure efficient implementation of the project; (vi) provide inputs for developing \nregulatory frameworks; and (vii) recommend sustainable measures to be adopted to ensure that \nthe poor can avail of electricity services. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $573,000 equivalent, consisting of $350,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $223,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$50,000 equivalent of the local cost. The financing will be provided on a grant basis from the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nremaining local currency cost of $173,000 equivalent. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are shown in Appendix 2. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program or project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  DOE  of  the  Ministry  for  Works,  Telecommunications,  Energy,  Road  Transport,  and \nShipping, will be the Executing Agency for the TA. DOE will establish a project unit with a full-\ntime project manager with qualifications acceptable to ADB. The Government will provide all \navailable  relevant  information  and  facilitate  the  collection  of  socioeconomic  data.  The \nGovernment will also help ensure adequate cooperation from FEA, local government bodies, \nand nongovernment organizations active in the project area. The director for energy will be \nresponsible for overall coordination among DOE, the consultants, ADB, the Government, and \nnongovernment organizations. \n \n12.  The TA will be carried out by an international consulting engineering firm, supported by \nassociated domestic consultants, with relevant experience in all aspects of the specified scope \nof work. The consultant will be selected through the quality and cost-based selection method \nand  the  simplified  technical  proposal  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants, or by other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Approximately 12 person-months for services of international consultants and 8 of \ndomestic consultants will be required. The equipment will be procured by the consultants in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines.  The  international  consultants  will  have \nexpertise in (i) rural electrification system planning, design, construction, and operation (team \nleader7);  (ii)  renewable  energy  sources  development;  (iii)  rural  electrification  financial  and \neconomic analysis; (iv) poverty impact assessment; and (v) environmental, regulatory, and \nsocial  analysis.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  rural  electrification \neconomics, (ii) renewable energy, (iii) socioeconomic analysis, and (iv) community development \nand participation. \n \n13.  The TA is expected to commence in March 2003 and be completed by March 2004. \nWithin 4 weeks after commencement, the consultants will submit an inception report detailing \ninitial findings and a refined action plan for conducting the study. A phase I report will be \nsubmitted within 4 months from commencement of the TA, will set forth the findings of phase I \nand will recommend the direction of work for phase II. Within 4 weeks of receipt of the phase I \nreport, the Government and ADB will convene the first tripartite meeting in Suva to review the \nreport.  Within  6  months  of  this  first  tripartite  meeting  (or  about  9  months  from  the \ncommencement of the TA), the consultants will submit a draft final report covering phases I and \n                                                 \n7  The team leader will be the same for phase I and phase II. ", "4 \nII. The Government, ADB, and the consultants will discuss at a second tripartite meeting the \ndraft final report within 4 weeks of its submission. Based on these discussions, the consultants \nwill finalize and submit the final report within 2 months. Based on this schedule, the TA will be \ncompleted within 12 months of start of the assignment. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultant are reported in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe Government of the Fiji Islands for Preparing the Rural Electrification Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.
