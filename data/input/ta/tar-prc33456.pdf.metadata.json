INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 2000 Country Programming Review Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC) requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) support for Government\nefforts to strengthen urban wastewater management.1 The Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC\nin April 2001 and met with officials of the Ministry of Construction (MOC), Ministry of Finance,\nand  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission  (SDPC).  The  Mission  reached  an\nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, and financing\nplan, and implementation arrangements for the Technical Assistance (TA).2  The TA framework\nis attached as Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In the PRC, the urban population has grown rapidly in line with economic growth during\nthe  past  two  decades.  This  has  resulted  in  greatly  increased  water  use  and  wastewater\ngeneration, causing the degradation of water quality, degradation of the urban environment, and\nthreats to public health.\n3. The current urban wastewater treatment rate is approximately 33 percent. This low\ntreatment rate contributes to the pollution of many of the country\u2019s rivers and lakes. Despite the\nGovernment\u2019s increasing environmental protection efforts, water pollution remains severe. In the\nseven major river basins, 52 percent of river courses do not meet Class III standards (suitable\nraw-water/sources for treatable potable supply).3 On river courses in urban areas, 16 percent\nare  at  the  lowest  Class  V  standard  and  36  percent  are  worse  than  Class  V  standards.\nEutrophication occurs in 75 percent of major freshwater lakes.4  The Government, in its Tenth\nFive-Year Plan, stated its objective to increase the rate of urban central wastewater treatment\nfrom  its  current  33  percent  to  45  percent  by  2005.  During  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan,\nexpenditures  on  water  pollution  control  will  reach  approximately  Y150  billion  ($18  billion\nequivalent). Public financing through state grants will not be sufficient to meet investment\nrequirements.  \u201cPolluter  pays\u201d  and  \u201cbeneficiaries  pays\u201d  principles  need  to  be  considered  in\nfinancing schemes.\n4. The Government recognizes that strengthening of tariff mechanisms is necessary for\ncost recovery and financing of wastewater management infrastructure. In 1999, MOC and\nSDPC  coissued  a  document  to  strengthen  wastewater  treatment  fee  mechanisms  by\nestablishing general principles for wastewater tariffs. Currently no specific wastewater tariff\nguidelines exist. The State Council is responsible for promulgating tariff laws, policies, and\nguidelines. Implementing regulations may be developed at the provincial or municipal level.\nGiven the lack of specific national wastewater tariff guidelines and the wide range of technical\nand institutional capabilities at the provincial and local levels, there is a wide variance in the\nestablished tariff measures and their effectiveness. Even in larger cities that collect wastewater\ntariffs, few are able to achieve full cost recovery. For example, in Tianjin where an ADB project\n                  \n1  Urban wastewater refers to municipal wastewater or domestic wastewater but may include wastewater from\ncommercial sources or light industry. Generally, in the PRC industries do not discharge into the municipal system,\nhowever, the TA will review and consider the influence of industrial wastewater for bases where it will be allowed to\nenter the municipal system.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in 26 March 2001\n3 The PRC Environmental Quality Standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is\nfor water resources and nationally protected bodies of water. Class II is for high-value fish production areas, class\nA protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class III is for potable water resources, class B protection\nareas, general fish protection areas, and swimming areas. Class IV is for general industrial water sources and\nnoncontact recreation areas. Class I water sources are the best quality and Class V the worst.\n4 ADB. 2001.PRC Urban Wastewater Overview Study. Draft Report. Manila", "2\nwas recently approved,5 a tariff system for full cost recovery is being developed as part of the\nProject. Currently an ADB staff consultant is completing a brief study to provide an overview of\nwastewater management issues for the PRC. This study will serve as a background document\nfor TA development and implementation.\n5. Improved  cost  recovery  through  an  effective  tariff  system  will  improve  financial\nmanagement. Improved financial management will increase the nascent interest of the private\nsector and other investments in the sector. The Government would like to increase multichannel\ninvestment  and  participation  in  urban  wastewater  management.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector\nDevelopment Strategy recognizes that a strong and dynamic private sector is crucial to long-\nterm economic development and acknowledges the private sector\u2019s contribution to sustaining\npro-poor growth and promoting social development. The private sector is keenly interested in\nsocial infrastructure development.\n6. Urban  environmental  improvement  is  vital  to  sustainable  development  and  poverty\nreduction. The linkages are qualitatively understood but have not been well quantified to-date.\nADB is currently undertaking a regional TA, which includes the PRC, to study the linkages and\nto  develop  strategies  for  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  improvement.6  The  ongoing\nUrban Poverty Study TA is (i) studying a wide-range of urban poverty issues in the PRC\nincluding incidence of poverty, poverty indicators, and poverty reduction measures; and (ii)\nestablishing a framework for setting regional poverty lines adjusted for price levels and local\ndevelopment conditions.7 The current TA will coordinate with the regional TA and the Urban\nPoverty Study TA, and incorporate, as appropriate, data, conclusions, and strategies that will\nimprove the positive effects of wastewater management on poverty reduction.\n7. To help the Government address the water shortage and water pollution issues, ADB\nhas accorded high priority to the water supply and sanitation sector in its operational strategy.\nImproving  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  in  the  rapidly  expanding  urban  centers  is\nimportant  to  improving  quality  of  life,  raising  health  standards,  arresting  environmental\ndegradation, and sustaining acceptable levels of economic growth. In line with this strategy,\nADB\u2019s operations in the water supply and sanitation sector have focused on (i) improving the\nefficiency of water supply, water distribution, and wastewater treatment systems; (ii) improving\ncost recovery by strengthening tariff systems for raw water, treated water, and wastewater; and\n(iii)  ensuring  conservation  of  natural  resources  and  environment  protection  by  continuing\nsupport for legislative and regulatory provisions governing water pollution and natural resources\nmanagement. Three TAs relating to water tariffs and urban management urban solid waste\nmanagement  have  particular  relevance  for  note  toward  implementing  management  and\ninstitutional aspects of ADB\u2019s strategy.8 The current TA addresses tariff issues for the third\nmajor urban social infrastructure sector.\n8. The current TA also supports the Government\u2019s objectives in the wastewater sector set\nout in the Ninth (1996-2000) and Tenth (2001-2005) Five-Year Plans. The TA is consistent with\nADB\u2019s strategy for the PRC, which emphasizes protection of the environment, wastewater\nmanagement,  and  expansion  of  water  supply,  particularly  in  urban  areas.  Wastewater\nmanagement projects are a major component of the current lending pipeline with five projects\n                  \n5 Loan 1797-PRC: Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and Water Resources, for $130 million, approved on 11 December\n2000.\n6\nTA 5939-REG: Strategies for Poverty Reduction through Environmental Improvement, for $500,000, approved on\n27 September 2000.\n7\nTA 3377-PRC: Urban Poverty Study, for $410,000, approved on 27 December 1999.\n8\nTA 2773-PRC: Water Supply Tariff Study, for $600,000, approved on 24 March 1997; TA 3250-PRC: Water Supply\nTariff Study II, for $950,000, approved on 3 September 1999; TA 3447-PRC: Strengthening Urban Solid Waste\nManagement, for $600,000, approved on 25 May 2000.", "3\nplanned in the 2002 and 2004 programs. The TA is expected to have a positive influence similar\nto  the  of  the  water  tariff  and  solid  waste  management  studies  namely  promulgation  and\nimplementation of effective water tariff systems in a case study city, and development of solid\nwaste tariff guidelines and methodologies. This promulgation and implementation process also\neffectively incorporates public participation.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n9. The main objective of the TA is to improve urban wastewater management and enable\ninvestment in wastewater infrastructure by developing national guidelines for wastewater tariffs,\nincluding tariff calculation methodologies. The guidelines will identify management systems and\ntariff calculation methods that will allow for full cost recovery subject to affordability and social\nconstraints, including capital investment, operation and maintenance, and administration needs.\nThe review will also identify constraints and opportunities for multichannel investment, e.g.,\nprivate sector participation, and make recommendations to encourage such investment and\nparticipation.\n10. The  study  will  result  in  nationwide  strengthening  of  tariff  mechanisms,  which  is\nnecessary  for  cost  recovery  and  financing  of  urgently  needed  wastewater  management\ninfrastructure. The improved cost recovery together with related recommendations will facilitate\nboth public sector and private sector participation in urban wastewater management. The TA\nwill contribute to ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction by introducing guidelines that\nensure the protection of the poor\u2019s access to sanitation and thereby contribute to improved\nquality of life.\nB. Scope\n11. The scope of the TA includes (i) an assessment of wastewater management issues and\nexisting practices internationally and within the PRC with a specific focus on wastewater tariff\nsystems;  (ii)  development  of  national  urban  wastewater  tariff  guidelines,  including  tariff\ncalculation methods; (iii) specific review and assessment of three case study cities, which will\nrepresent a range of population size, economic development, and geographic regions; (iv)\npreparation of a report on urban wastewater management and tariff system assessment; and (v)\nan assessment of constraints and opportunities for multichannel investment and provision of\nrecommendations to encourage such investment. Particular attention will be paid to poverty\nissues. The Government\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction will be reviewed, the impact of the\nproposed tariff guidelines on the poor will be assessed, and specific measures will be proposed\nto ensure the poor\u2019s access to sanitation. The assessment and guidelines will be prepared with\nconsideration of policies, laws, and regulations for wastewater management and environmental\nprotection. It will promote environmental protection, including integrated management of urban\nand  industrial  wastewater,  reduction  of  wastewater  generation,  and  wastewater  reuse  and\nrecycling.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent, comprising $506,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $369,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government has\nrequested ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and\n$194,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis\nfrom the ADB-funded TA program. The Government will finance the balance of local currency", "4\ncost, equivalent to $175,000, for counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support\nservices, and logistics. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n13. The TA will be implemented over 12 month periods beginning in November 2001 with\nexpected completion by October 2002. A firm of international consultants, in association with\ndomestic consultants, will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. The TA will require 17 person-months of international and 23 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services. The consultants will have expertise in wastewater management\n(including operations), urban infrastructure financing, tariff reform, financial analysis, economic\nanalysis, institutional development, social impact assessment, and legal and regulatory analysis\nof urban infrastructure projects. Draft outline terms of reference for the TA consultants are in\nAppendix 3.\n14. MOC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It has appointed a TA manager to be\nresponsible for overall TA management and coordination. MOC will be guided by a steering\ncommittee, chaired by the responsible vice-minister of MOC, and including the directors general\nof the Department of Urban Construction and the Department of International Affairs, MOC. It\nmay include representatives from MOF, SDPC, State Environmental Protection Agency, and\nMinistry of Water Resources. MOC will determine the appropriate composition of the steering\ncommittee and organize it prior to TA inception. The counterpart staff and facilities to support\nthe TA consultants will be provided by MOC. MOC will, in consultation with ADB, identify the\nthree case study cities prior to TA contract negotiations. Three alternate cities will also be\nidentified. The case study cities will be agreed to by MOC, ADB, and the consultants at contract\nnegotiations.\n15. The consultants will submit (i) an inception report after one month of fieldwork, (ii) an\ninterim report within six months of TA commencement, (iii) a draft final report within 10 months\nof TA commencement, and (iv) a final report within one month of receiving comments from ADB\nand the Government.
