INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) ranks finance sector development and financial \ninclusion  through  the  involvement  of  private  financial  institutions  high  in  its  Strategy  2020 \nagenda and in country programs and strategies for its Central Asian and South Caucasus \ndeveloping member countries.1 Clients of financial institutions and enterprises are important \ngenerators of employment and producers of goods and services. Financial inclusion also ranks \nhigh on the strategic agenda for most of these countries, given the very low access to finance. \nThe regional technical assistance (TA) for promoting financial inclusion and stability in ADB\u2019s \ntransition member countries will support these goals. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB sovereign operations in Central Asian and South Caucasus developing member \ncountries  (transition  economies)  have  focused  on  improving  the  institutional,  legal,  and \nregulatory framework of the finance sector through loans and TA.3 Private sector operations \nhave focused on supporting the finance sector through credit lines, mainly to small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) and rural beneficiaries.  \n \n3.  After more than 2 decades of transition from planned to market-based systems, the \nfinance sectors in the transition economies are still characterized by high volatility to external \nshocks and challenging corporate governance issues that emerged due to a legal and power \nvacuum during the early years of transition. Most importantly, private enterprise activity\u2014an \nimportant  provider  of  employment  and  income\u2014is  subdued  as  a  result  of  the  challenging \nbusiness climate and low or costly access to capital.  \n \n4.  Since 2008, the global financial crisis has adversely affected the fragile finance sectors, \nresulting in growing relevance and demand for ADB nonsovereign TA and training as an integral \ncomponent of ADB investment support to the nascent private sector. Growth of commercial \nloans has contracted, reducing the already low coverage of the finance sector in depth and \noutreach. For example, the average private sector loan\u2013gross domestic product (GDP) ratio \nremains less than 30% in ADB transition economies, far below other developing economies, \nwhich averaged 38% in 2012.4 The 2008 crisis and its aftermath highlighted risks associated \nwith  excessive  reliance  on  funding  in  foreign  currency,  asset-to-liability  maturity  mismatch \nproblems,  inadequate  risk  management,  and  ineffective  regulation  and  supervision.  For \nexample, nonperforming loans in Kazakhstan are reportedly high at 30% of gross loans (as of \nOctober 2013), reflecting the high foreign exchange exposure of the banks\u2019 borrowers and \nresulting in massive defaults when the local currency depreciated during the crisis.5 \n \n5.  Access to finance remains a barrier to sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the \ntransition economies, and is generally ranked among the most important obstacles to doing \nbusiness. The lack of developed financial markets, as measured by several indicators in recent \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 December 2013. \n3  ADB member countries covered by this TA are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, \nMongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Currently ADB\u2019s sovereign operations have ongoing financial \nintermediation loans support funding constraints in Armenia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2013. Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia Regional Update. Washington, DC. \n5  The National Bank of Kazakhstan indicates that these nonperforming loans were fully provisioned as of October \n2013.  \n ", "2 \ninternational reports, is considered a significant competitive  disadvantage.6 Although banks \ngenerally dominate the finance sector, the penetration of most banking systems is low. The \ntransition economies\u2019 banks had less than 70 ATMs per 100,000 adult population in 2012, far \nbelow the Russian benchmark of 182.7 The countries\u2019 capital markets also remain small. Stock \nmarket  capitalization  is  only  1.6%  of  GDP  in  Armenia  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  While \ngovernments and regulatory bodies can address many of the policy, legal, and regulatory issues \nconstraining  capital  market  development  with  ADB  sovereign  support, 8  private  financial \ninstitutions  need  nonsovereign  TA  to  diversify  their  risks  and  develop  their  capabilities  as \ncompetitive service providers, and to build capacity to ensure they are ready to participate in \ncapital market financing as this sector develops.  \n6. Strengthening financial infrastructure and increasing access to finance are high on the\ndevelopment agenda of the transition economies. Despite their differing stages of development, \nthe common emphasis has been on developing banking, creating wholesale payment systems, \nand implementing accounting and auditing rules for large firms. Progress has been significant, \nbut the distortions that remain impede sector growth. In  addition, loan portfolios are often \nconcentrated  in  a  few  sectors,  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  have  a  restricted  role. \nOpportunities for savings remain limited and are often viewed as risky. SMEs and farmers have \nlimited  access  to  finance.  Home  loans  are  typically  short  in  tenor  and  expensive.  Legal \nenforcement, governance, and transparency are often weak. These challenges need to be \naddressed. \n7. Lack  of  strategic  focus  and  capacity  limits  the  opportunities  for  private  financial\ninstitutions in the region to facilitate greater access to finance. Corporate skills and leadership in \nfinancial institutions play an important role in addressing challenges and leading by example in \nthe transition economies. Financial institution leaders can promote good practices to improve \noutreach, offer better services, and generate consumer confidence through effective marketing, \nimproved  products,  and  responsible  finance  policies.  However,  many  financial  institutions \noperating in the transition economies are influenced by their owners and management by post-\nSoviet style and practices that do not conform to international standards of good governance, \nwhich results in low public trust in the financial system. \n8. While  sovereign  support  for  finance  sector  reforms  has  translated  into  laws  and\nregulations that promote good practice, these often have not led to greater borrower access to \nthe right type of credit (in terms of tenor, currency, and interest rate base), to credit that is fairly \npriced to reflect risk following sound market principles, or to increased opportunities for savers \nand investors. Most nonsovereign interventions have been made almost exclusively through \ninvestment financing (credit lines and guarantees) and equity participation. ADB experience \nhighlights the need to provide additional TA support to involve existing and prospective ADB \nprivate financial institution clients in formulating business strategies, operational policies, and \ngovernance. The TA will help address issues in a solution-focused dialogue with these clients. \n6 World Economic Forum. 2013. Global Competitiveness Report 2012\u20132013.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved performance of qualified financial institutions \n(QFIs).  Indicators  to  track  this  will  include  accounting  and  reporting  practices  that  match \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as requirements of central banks. \n \n10.  The outcome of the TA will be improved institutional policies and financial products of \nQFIs. The TA will address constraints faced by QFIs with regards to product and market \ndevelopment, and contribute to enhancing the quality of ADB non-sovereign financial sector \ninterventions.  Performance  will  be  measured  in  terms  of  keys  areas  that  reflect  improved \nbanking services and prudential requirements. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will improve the capacity of QFIs in transition economies to provide competitive \nservices to underserved customers and sectors, and will provide solutions to the constraints \nthey face. It will address corporate governance and risk issues, and establish synergies with \nother ADB operations. This will be accomplished through one or a combination of the following \nmeasures in QFIs targeted by the Financial Institutions Division (PSFI) of ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations  Department  (PSOD):  (i)  well-targeted  institutional  diagnostics;  \n(ii) customized solutions for strategy, system, and product development; and (iii) related training \nand capacity building. \n \n12.  The  outputs  will  include  (i)  institutional  diagnostics  of  issues  to  be  addressed;  \n(ii)  identification  of  solutions  in  a  consultative  process  involving  QFI  management,  TA \nconsultants, and ADB; and (iii) preparation of product- and topic-focused implementation plans \nincluding the development and testing of new products, and outreach (including branch and \nbranchless banking solutions, risk management, corporate governance and controls, as well as \nfinancial literacy measures); and (iv) execution and supervision of the plans. The outputs will be \naccomplished through training and capacity building. Areas that may be addressed include \ncorporate  governance,  risk  management,  introduction  to  Basel  II  and  III  standards,  and \nresponsible  finance  policies.  Other  areas  are  product  solutions  for  local  currency  finance; \nmicrofinance; and housing, SME, and rural finance. Products may include innovative modalities \nto support SME financing; microfinance and insurance; and debt instruments (long-term local \ncurrency finance); as well as products that create synergies with other sectors such as urban \nservices, energy, and transport.9  \n \n13.  After completion of the measures carried out by the QFIs, the TA will support regional \nseminars to share the TA experiences and results, and receive feedback for possible future \ninterventions. Training programs will be held in host institutions throughout the region, as well as \nin  other  facilities  as  needed.  The  TA  will  fund  travel  expenses  of  resource  persons. \nRepresentatives from the QFIs and additional eligible participants will pay for their own travel \ncosts and related expenses.  \n \n                                                \n9  Examples may include energy efficiency, renewable energy, and housing finance.  \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,154,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  The  remaining  cost  will  be \ndirectly funded by the QFIs as stipulated in TA agreements with ADB. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will identify and select the QFIs based on the following criteria: \n(i)  The QFI should be a regulated financial institution and the target of an ADB \nnonsovereign investment, including existing and anticipated investments. \n(ii)  The QFI\u2019s top management should be committed to conducting innovations in its \nbusiness that are scalable and able to have a demonstration effect on private \nfinancial institutions in transition economies. \n(iii)  The QFI\u2019s management has put in place a project team and agrees to share up \nto 35% of the TA cost. \n(iv)  The QFI has or is willing to put in place policies supporting ADB efforts to \npromote good governance, combat money laundering, and ensure environmental \nand social safeguards. \n(v)  ADB is satisfied with the integrity due diligence carried out on the QFI. \n(vi)  PSOD is satisfied with the design of the support in the context of existing and \nanticipated financial institution transactions. \n     \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with PSFI acting as the focal point. ADB \nwill administer the TA; it may delegate parts of the TA to selected QFIs in compliance with ADB \nprocedures and after consultation with ADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management \nDepartment. Once identified, the QFIs and PSOD will confirm in a TA agreement letter the \ncustomized  terms  of  reference,  detailed  cost  and  financing  arrangements,  and  consultant \nselection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Prior  to  the \ncommencement of services, ADB will obtain the host country\u2019s no objection to the TA activities. \nTA implementation will begin in January 2014 and be completed by December 2017. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  To  ensure  complementarity,  PSFI  will  work  closely  on  relevant  issues  with  other \ndivisions within PSOD, and with ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia and East Asia financial sector, \npublic management, and trade divisions; the Treasury Department; and the Office of Risk \nManagement. ADB-funded inputs will include about 18 person-months of consulting services. \nThe selection method will be determined for each intervention in agreement with the QFI after \nconsultation with ADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nselected qualified financial institutions for Promoting Financial Inclusion and Stability in ADB\u2019s \nTransition Member Countries, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved   By 2020, QFIs have  IFRS audits,  Macroeconomic and \nperformance of QFIs  demonstrated improved  central bank reports,  financial market stability  \nperformance with regards  ADB staff analysis   \nto IFRS and central banks\u2019    Risk \nperformance  standards   Slow uptake of finance \nsector reforms including \nBasel II and III \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved institutional,  By 2018 QFIs have  QFI reports  Supportive regulations \npolicies  and products  improved  in relevant    in place by relevant \nof QFIs    areas of:    central banks \nCorporate Governance   \nRisk Management \nProduct development and \noutreach \nProfitability and Solvency \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
