INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) to Bangladesh\u2019s energy agencies \nis envisaged to assess floating solar photovoltaic power potential, develop an investment plan \ncovering solar PV, wind, biomass, and other renewable energy resources that complements both \nthe government\u2019s climate change commitments and energy sector interventions by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).1 Also, the TA intends to strengthen the capacity of the energy agencies \nand other stakeholders in large-scale renewable energy project planning and implementation. The \nTA is listed in the country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2019\u20132021.2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Bangladesh has achieved sustained economic growth over the past decade. The gross \ndomestic product (GDP) grew at an average of 6.3% during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period \n(2011\u20132015). The country\u2019s Seventh Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 aims to achieve an average \nannual GDP growth of 7.4% and has achieved GDP growth of 7.3% in 2017. The power sector \nhas made significant progress in sustaining the economic growth. As of June 2018, the country\u2019s \ninstalled power generation capacity stood at 18,753 megawatts (MW), compared with 4,942 MW \nin 2009. 3 Bangladesh peak power demand exceeded 12,644 MW in 2017 from 11,405 MW in \n2016, and is growing at a rate of 10.9% annually.4 As of July 2018, 90% of the population has \naccess to electricity, compared with 60% in 2012. The government\u2019s Vision 2021 aims at \n\u201cElectricity for All\u201d and achieving an installed generation capacity of 20,000 MW by 2021. \n \n3.  As Bangladesh relies largely on indigenous natural gas to generate electricity, long-term \nenergy security and the need to diversify its fuel mix are major challenges for the power sector. \nCurrently, natural gas accounts for 62% of electricity generation, diesel and furnace oil for almost \n30%, and renewable energy (including hydropower) for less than 3%. In the absence of major gas \nfield discoveries, the country faces acute shortage of natural gas in the next 7\u20138 years. Natural \ngas supply constraints have already curtailed the operations of some power plants, increasing \ndependence on imported oil (mostly furnace oil and diesel). Hence, there is a pressing need to \nplan and diversify the fuel mix to minimize fossil fuel use for power generation. \n \n4.  Due to strong economic growth over the past few years, power demand continues to \noutpace supply and is expected to exceed 20,000 MW by 2025 and 45,000 MW by 2040. To meet \nthe growing power demand sustainably, the revised 2016 Power System Master Plan set targets \nfor a generation mix by 2041 of 35% gas, 35% coal, 15% cross-border imports (including \nrenewable energy), 10% nuclear, and 5% oil. Due to depletion of domestic gas reserves, the \nfuture gas supply will depend on imported liquefied natural gas. Bangladesh has probable coal \nreserves of up to 3,300 million tons but has yet to make any strategic decision about using \ndomestic coal resources, mainly due to environment and social concerns. Hence, future coal \ngeneration in Bangladesh will depend on imported coal. The country\u2019s first nuclear unit of 1,200 \nMW capacity is expected to start operating by 2024, while the second unit of 1,200 MW is to be \ncommissioned in 2025. \n \n                                                \n1  The renewable energy investment plan will include strategies and pipelines for deployment of solar, wind, and        \nbiomass energy resources. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Bangladesh\u2019s renewable energy potential is estimated at 3,666 MW, including potential \nsolar energy of 2,680 MW\u20141,400 MW from solar parks, 635 MW from solar rooftops, 100 MW \nfrom solar home systems, and 545 MW from solar photovoltaic pumping for irrigation\u2014along with \n637 MW from wind, 275 MW from biomass, 10 MW from biogas, 60 MW from small hydro, 3 MW \nfrom mini grid and micro grid, and 1 MW from waste to energy.5 Bangladesh has been slow in \ndeveloping  renewable  energy,  despite  the  country\u2019s  2008  Renewable  Energy  Policy,  and \nBangladesh Vision 2021\u2019s plan to generate up to 10% of its power from renewable energy by \n2021, and the government\u2019s 500 MW Solar Power Initiative. Land acquisition has been a major \nhurdle in developing utility scale solar photovoltaic power plants, as existing land policy restricts \nthe use of agricultural land for large solar power plants. The government has encouraged private \nsector participation in renewable energy development through competitive bidding and unsolicited \nproposals. Multiple expressions of interests from private sector developers to invest in solar power \nprojects for generating approximately 900 MW have been signed, but only a few of the proposed \nsolar power projects have advanced due to land constraints and inability to reach financial closure. \n \n6.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  is  committed  to  meeting  its  Nationally  Determined \nContributions  under  the  Paris  Climate  Accord,  which  includes  reducing  greenhouse  gas \nemissions by 5% by 2030 from the business-as-usual case. To meet this target, up to 1,000 MW \nof  solar  power  installation  is  planned  for  medium-term  development.  However,  given  land \nconstraints and the government\u2019s policy to retain as much land as possible for agriculture, utility \nscale solar photovoltaic power plants can be constructed only on marginal land, which poses big \nchallenges for future scaling up. Floating solar photovoltaic power system is an ideal solution for \nBangladesh as they do not compete with agricultural land, do not suffer from efficiency penalties \ncaused  by  high  ambient temperatures,  and  can  be quickly  deployed and  built  in  stages.6 \nBangladesh has large water reservoirs, but the potential of floating solar photovoltaic power has \nnot yet been fully mapped. Some development partners are currently supporting wind and \nbiomass  resource  mapping,  while  investment  plans  for  strategic  deployment  of  renewable \nresources are lacking. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: share of renewable energy for sustainable \npower supply of Bangladesh increased.7 The TA will have the following outcome: capacity of \ngovernment  agencies  and  other  stakeholders  for  large-scale  renewable  energy  investment \nplanning and implementation strengthened.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Potential for floating solar photovoltaic power assessed. The TA will \nassess the country\u2019s floating solar photovoltaic potential and identify candidate project sites that \n                                                \n5  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. 2016.

Output 2: Projects for deployment of other renewable energy resources identified. \nThe TA will help identify suitable project sites for deployment of wind, biomass, and/or other \nrenewable energy resources. It will also develop commercially viable business models that can \nbe readily replicated and scaled up in the near term. \n \n10.  Output 3: Grid impact assessment completed. The TA will carry out a grid impact study \nto analyze the impact of variable renewable energy coming into the grid at the selected project \nsites  and  formulate  appropriate  mitigation  measures  to  ensure  efficient  operation  of  the \ntransmission grid. This exercise will be linked to output 5 as the TA will provide training to the \nPower Grid Corporation of Bangladesh to perform similar studies in the future, including software-\nbased modeling and/or simulation of typical scenarios, as well as system operation training for \nmore effective scheduling, forecasting, and planning. \n \n11.  Output 4: Updated grid code and operational guidelines proposed.  The TA will \nupdate the existing grid code and operating guidelines to facilitate power system expansion using \na variety of generation sources from renewable energy. Ensuring smooth operations will require \nthe use of intelligent energy network technology including next-generation supervisory control and \ndata acquisition systems, energy storage, and other high-level technology for renewable energy \nintegration, optimization and control. This output will help address the necessary grid code \nupdates, specifically automatic frequency control, voltage control, economic dispatching, cross-\ncountry interconnections, tariff structures to incentivize generators for grid frequency and power \nfactor control, and demand forecasting and generation planning (including prescribing penalties \nfor noncompliance). \n \n12.  Output 5: Institutional capacity strengthened. The TA will provide training to the energy \nagencies and other stakeholders to strengthen their knowledge and capacity in renewable energy \ninvestment planning and implementation. This includes, but is not limited to, orientation on (i)  \nlarge-scale renewable energy development and associated environmental issues, (ii) integration \nof variable renewable energy into the grid, (iii) intelligent energy management systems (\u201csmart \ngrid\u201d),  (iv)  floating  solar  power  systems,  (v)  new  business  models  for  renewable  energy \ndevelopment and innovative financing mechanisms, and (vi) renewable energy prospects for \nemploying innovative technology.  \n \nC.
