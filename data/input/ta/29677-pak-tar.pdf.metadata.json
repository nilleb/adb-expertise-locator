The Government of Pakistan has requested the Bank to provide advisory\ntechnical assistance (TA) to help address issues that will arise as a result of the proposal\nto import natural gas into the country. The TA was first identified during the Country\nProgram Portfolio Review Mission in 1995 and was included in the Bank's program for\nPakistan for 1996. The Fact-finding Mission that visited Pakistan in February 1996, held\ndiscussions with the relevant Government authorities and reached an understanding on\nthc scope, cost estimates, financing plan, terms of reference for the consultants, and\nimplementation arrangements for the TA.1\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Pakistan faces significant challenges in the energy sector. During the past\ndecade, commercial energy consumption has expanded rapidly at about 6.3 percent per\nannum, It is projected to continue to grow at an average rate of about 7 percent per\nannum between 1994-2018. Indigenous natural gas production, which now totals about\n1600 million cubic feet per day has an important role in the country's energy balance\nbecause it meets about 31 percent of the country's energy requirements. However, the\ncountry has substantial untapped hydrocarbon reserves, especially natural gas, and in the\nshort to medium term, the most economic option to obtain additional energy is to\naccelerate the development of domestic oil and natural gas resources. Recently, the\nGovernment, with assistance from the Bank2 has taken policy initiatives and reforms to\nmake investments in the petroleum sector attractive to private enterprise. The Petroleum\nPolicy, issued in 1994, places more reliance on market forces in the exploration,\nproduction, transportation, and distribution of petroleum products. It also improves prices\nand returns for the domestic oil and natural gas producers, oil refining and marketing\ncompanies, and the natural gas transmission and distribution companies. In addition, the\ntwo natural gas transmission and distribution companies, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines\n(SNGPL) and the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), are in the process of being\nprivatized. As part of the deregulation of the natural gas subsector, a draft natural gas law\nvesting tariff setting and other regulatory powers in a Gas Regulatory Authority has been\nprepared.3\n3. The Government's new policies are expected to encourage investment in\nthe exploration and development of indigenous oil and natural gas resources. However,\neven after assuming a reasonable successful exploration program in the country based on\nthe continued adoption of an aggressive incentive policy for the private sector on part of\nthe Government, indigenous production will not be able to meet the demand. The import of\nfuel is projected to grow from 11.3 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 1994 to 21.8 million\ntoe in 2003 and to 51.7 million toe in 2013.\n4.

A preliminary analysis indicates that import of natural gas from\nthese gas rich countries by pipeline to Pakistan to meet part of the country's primary\nenergy needs is economically attractive compared with import of liquid petroleum.\nTherefore, the Government has responded favorably to preliminary proposals by the\nprivate sector to supply piped natural gas from regional countries.\n5. Projects such as the proposed regional gas pipelines have long gestation\nperiods, large capital requirements, and complicated legal and financial structures. While\nspecific issues may be resolved for projects that import gas, the Government must first\ncreate the proper environment for the projects by addressing the issues that will arise as a\nresult of the import of natural gas. These include: the changes in the regulatory regime of\nthe sector, gas pricing, and allocation as the result of competition on the supply side; the\nimpact on local natural gas producers and on the soon to be privatized gas transmission\nand distribution companies; and the effect on future investment in new exploration\nactivities in the country. Earlier, the Bank has assisted the Government in the formulation\nof the gas sector regulatory frame work and the gas pricing structure. This TA will build on\nthe work done earlier. It will also assist the Government in realistically assessing the\neconomic impact of different proposals from the private sector and will lay the foundation\nfor the policy framework for natural gas imports.\nIll.\t The TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n6. The main objective of the TA is to improve the policy environment for\nprivate sector investment in gas import projects.

The TA will analyze natural gas import needs of Pakistan in the context of\nits medium and long-term energy requirements including the fuel requirements of the\nindependent power producers and the economic impact of switching oil-based power\nplants to gas. The different options for importing natural gas into Pakistan will be evaluated\nto establish the most viable alternative considering the economic cost of the additional\ninfrastructure required in the country, the target user group, and the timing of the\navailability of the imported natural gas. The consultants will evaluate the experience of\nother countries in importing natural gas and assess their applicability to Pakistan. The TA\nwill identify the changes that may be necessary to the existing laws, rules, and policies\ngoverning the hydrocarbon sector to create a favorable environment for private sector\ninvestors and to ensure that investors in indigenous production are not disadvantaged\ncompared with the importers.

The total cost of the TA is estimated at $622,000 equivalent, of which\n$526,000 is in foreign currency and $96,000 equivalent is in local currency, see\nAppendix 2. The foreign currency cost will be for the remuneration, per diem, international\ntravel of the international consultants, communications, reports, and the participation of\none staff from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) for contract\nnegotiations with the consultants in Manila. The local currency component will meet the\ncost of local consultants, miscellaneous administrative and support services, domestic air\ntravel, city transportation, salaries of the counterpart staff of the MPNR, administrative\nsupport, and office accommodation.\n9. The entire foreign currency cost amounting to $526,000 and part of the\nlocal currency cost amounting to $74,000 equivalent will be financed by the Bank.

It is estimated that the TA will require about\n12 person-months of international and 9 person-months of local consulting services. It is\nenvisaged that the international consultants to be recruited will have extensive experience\nand expertise in developing energy options, evaluating the technical and economic\naspects of such options, and the legal and regulatory issues associated with cross border\ngas supplies. The local consultants will have experience and expertise in energy market\nsurveys, gas systems design, cost estimation; and the country's legal framework, rules,\nand regulations related to the gas and energy sectors.\n11.

MPNR will provide at least one senior officer as counterpart staff, suitable office\nspace, and administrative support for the consultants. MPNR will arrange for all data and\nnecessary information to be available to the consultants, and will organize meetings for the\nconsultants with government agencies, and gas sector and business organizations\ninvolved in the import of natural gas.\n12.

The Steering Committee will be chaired by the Secretary, MPNR.\nThe other members of the Steering Committee will include as a minimum the Joint\nSecretary (Development), MPNR, and representatives of the Director General (Gas),\nMPNR; SNGPL; and SSGC. The Steering Committee may have other members as\nnecessary.
