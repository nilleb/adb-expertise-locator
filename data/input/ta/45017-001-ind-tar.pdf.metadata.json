INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Strengthening the resilience of flood-prone areas against flooding is an important part of \nthe climate change strategy of the Government of India. The National Water Mission of the \nNational Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) has identified a need to develop flood \nmanagement strategies for the country and for these to include plans for community-based \nadaption.  The  2012  draft  National  Water  Policy  advocates  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures to avert floods and droughts that include preparedness and coping mechanisms. The \ngovernment is promoting sector reforms at the state level to achieve balanced and integrated \napproaches to flood management. \n \n2.  Flood management is an important facet of climate change adaptation in India because \nrainfall and the risk of extreme rainfall events are expected to increase in large parts of the \ncountry.  In  September  2011,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  completed  technical \nassistance (TA) that supported the National Water Mission in establishing the requirements for \neffective, coordinated planning processes for climate change adaptation. The TA identified the \nkey institutional and reform needs for integrated water resources management. Greater efforts \nare being made globally to achieve a more integrated approach to flood management since \ninfrastructure alone cannot deliver the desired results. The steering committee for India\u2019s 12th \ndevelopment plan1 has recommended the application of holistic integrated basin development \nand flood management in the country and state governments have emphasized the difficulties \nthey face in implementing holistic approaches to flood management.  \n \n3.  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 under the \n2012 pipeline.2 In December 2011, the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) asked ADB to \nsupport operational research initiatives to help better integrate nonstructural and community-led \nmeasures into flood planning and management. ADB fact-finding was conducted on 15 February \nand 9 March 2012, to consult the government on the preliminary design of the TA, including \nexpected  impact,  outcome  and  outputs;  the  financing  modality;  cost  estimates  and \nimplementation schedule and arrangements. \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n4.  Flooding is a major problem in India, causing significant damage each year. Flood risk \ndiscourages private investment and contributes to persistent disparities between regions and \nbetween rural and urban areas. The poor are especially vulnerable, particularly in low-income \nstates.3 Low-lying coastal areas are exposed to the combined impacts of the threat of rising sea \nlevels and floods. Massive urban spread worsens flooding due to increased runoff produced by \ngrowing populations and their unplanned expansion into flood plains. Flash floods and flooding \nwithin  urban  areas  are  a  growing  problem  contributing  to  pollution  and  health  problems, \nespecially in urban and periurban areas with poor sanitation. \n \n5.  In 2004, India\u2019s Planning Commission estimated that about 12% of the country\u2019s land \narea, or 45 million hectares were prone to flooding. About 70% of these vulnerable areas, or 32 \nmillion hectares could be provided with reasonable protection, according to the commission. So \n \n                                                      \n1  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2012. A New Approach to the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017. \nDelhi \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 May 2012. \n3  The states of Assam, Bihar, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are estimated to account for about \n75% of the country\u2019s flood-prone area. ", "2               \nfar, flood protection and flood management has been provided for about half of this land. \nClimate change is expected to affect agriculture in India through a greater number of extreme \nclimate events, including heat waves, droughts, and floods. Unless strong adaptation measures \nare  taken,  many  impact  studies  point  to  severe  reductions  in  crop  yields  in  the  coming \ndecades\u2014particularly in South Asia. India\u2019s national and state governments are investing in \nflood management through embankment and reservoir construction, drainage improvements, \ntown infrastructure protection, and the raising of villages. Nonstructural efforts have focused on \nflood forecasting, flood warning, and reservoir management. A nationwide flood forecasting and \nwarning system has been established by the Central Water Commission. Structural measures \nor engineering interventions are designed to keep floodwaters away from people. Nonstructural \nmeasures aim to keep people away from floodwaters and help communities adapt to and deal \nwith flood threats through prudent land management and disaster preparedness. \n \n6.  As projections of more frequent extreme weather events and thus greater flood risks \npush the expected costs of providing sufficient flood control infrastructure higher, approaches to \nflood management are being reassessed. The engineering-focused approach employed up to \nnow in India does not adequately incorporate the benefits and opportunities of integrated flood \nmanagement (IFM). As high-profile disasters such as the failure of the levees around New \nOrleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 showed, even communities with engineered protection \ncan face significant flooding risks from events such as embankment failure. An integrated \napproach can reduce the human and socioeconomic impacts of floods and incorporate social, \neconomic and ecological benefits in the management of flood plains. Examples of nonstructural \nmeasures that can be mainstreamed to complement structural flood solutions include spatial \nplanning, flood plain zoning, provision of relief areas and mechanisms for evacuation; managed \naquifer recharge in flood zones; wetland management; flood warning, flood insurance, and flood \ncompensation schemes and crop planning.  \n \n7.  IFM can address flood risks in a holistic way, allowing stakeholders to participate, and \nlink  flood  management  with  sustainable  economic  development.  It  provides  flexibility  in \nresponding  to  future  flooding  by  using  a  diverse  range  of  instruments  to  manage  flood \nresponses. This approach, nonetheless, has made little progress in India despite its successful \nadoption in other parts of the world. More information is needed by planners to demonstrate the \ncost effectiveness and cost-benefit advantages of various integrated interventions. IFM requires \ncooperation and crosscutting institutional mechanisms and planning between the land and water \nsectors and their stakeholders. Nonstructural flood management has been constrained in India \nby institutional and social obstacles to the integration of land management and river basin \nmanagement. This challenge results from the fact that many of the country\u2019s river basin flood \nplains are now densely populated due to unplanned urban sprawl. Other obstacles to the \nadoption of an holistic integrated approach include a lack of (i) well-researched evaluations and \ndocumented  guidelines  on  the  nonstructural  approaches,  and  (ii)  policy  and  institutional \nmechanisms to facilitate implementation of new integrated ideas and strategies. As a result, \nplanners and engineers generally focus on more straightforward engineering solutions alone.  \n\u00a0\n8.  Linkages. A preliminary approach paper for the country\u2019s upcoming 12th five-year plan \nfor 2012\u20132016 called for greater attention to management of water, forests, and land to support \neconomic growth. The working group for the plan recommended an integrated basin-wide flood \nmanagement approach, flood forecasting, construction of reservoirs, diversion of flood waters, \nand flood warning systems. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2009\u20132012 identified a \nneed to focus on knowledge solutions, the preparation of operationally relevant knowledge ", "3 \n \nproducts, exposure to best practices, and promoting learning across sectors and states.4 The \nADB water operational plan (2011\u20132020) forecast is more frequent and severe extreme weather \nevents in India and states that the effects of such a worsening of weather can be mitigated by \nstructural and nonstructural measures such as water governance and flood management.  \n\u00a0\nIII.    THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be to increase the protection and resilience of the flood-prone areas in \nIndia.  The  outcome  will  be  to  improve  knowledge  for  decision  making  and  program \nimplementation  of  IFM.  The  TA  will  undertake  operational  research  to  identify  and  test \nintegrated flood mitigation and flood plain management strategies appropriate for India. The \nstrategies will balance structural and nonstructural measures and provide the mechanisms for \nmainstreaming IFM at different government levels. The TA will help promote change from a \ncurrent narrow, structurally focused flood protection intervention approach in the country and \nsupport mainstreaming of integrated and holistic management measures. The TA will study one \nfocal sub-basin in depth as well as two secondary sub-basins in less detail. The study will \ndevelop strategies and approaches appropriate for implementation in the focal sub-basin but \nalso replicable in other flood-prone sub-basins and states.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two phases, starting with phase 1, which will comprise \nscoping  studies.  These  studies  will  involve  (i)  a  review  of  the  lessons  learned  from  the \nintegration  of  structural  and  nonstructural  components  of  flood  management  in  India  and \nglobally; (ii) identification of the scope and location of the research activities; and (iii) preliminary \ndata collection, and support for the phase 2 start-up. Phase 2 will immediately follow from phase \n1 and will comprise operational research to support the mainstreaming of IFM in a way that \ntakes into account projected future conditions and climate change uncertainties.  \n \n11.  The research will develop proposals for IFM strategies for India. The studies will focus \non three selected sub-basins, consisting of one focal sub-basin and two secondary sub-basins \nthat are highly vulnerable to flooding and encompassing both rural and urban areas. Detailed \nstudies will be implemented in the focal basin together with broader, less detailed, parallel \nstudies, in the two secondary sub-basins. Through these sub-basin studies it will be possible to \nexamine a broad mix of flood and flood management issues. The research will incorporate flood \nrisk assessments for key sectors in the selected sub-basins. The research will include a review \nof international experience of IFM. There will be comparison and evaluation of these results with \nlessons learned in the selected sub-basins to ensure that approaches tested in India are based \non real evidence of effectiveness.  \n\u00a0\n12.  The operational research will (i) be based on international practices in flood mitigation, \nflood risk control, and floodplain management; (ii) explicitly tackle the implications of climate \nchange  and  uncertainty;  (iii)  develop  a  balanced  framework  for  a  mix  of  structural  and \nnonstructural flood management measures appropriate to flood situations and community and \ndevelopment needs; (iv) incorporate social, economic, and environmental considerations under \na range of flood scenarios and management options to determine value for money of different \n \n                                                      \n4 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n  \n ", "4               \napproaches; and (v) develop a participatory and institutional framework to mainstream IFM \nplanning consistent with the principles of integrated water resources management and the goals \nof sustainable economic development. The TA will incorporate the following activities:  \n\u00a0\n(i)  It will prepare a detailed review for the focal sub-basin of current approaches to \nflood protection and their effectiveness, including assessments of flood hazards, \nhydrology, and technical measures used for flood protection and management. It \nwill draw on experiences globally and in India in the use of existing and emerging \napproaches.  \n(ii)  It will assess the impacts of climate change scenarios on flood frequency and \nseverity, drawing on linked climate and hydrological models. The risks of error \npropagation from climate and hydrological models will also be evaluated. \n(iii)  It will incorporate social, economic, and environmental considerations under a \nrange of flood scenarios and management options to determine value for money \nof  different  approaches.  It  will  assess  constraints  and  difficulties  of \nimplementation and prepare a matrix of parameters to support decision making.  \n(iv)  It will develop frameworks to assess community vulnerabilities to flooding which \nwill  identify  economic  needs  and  opportunities  for  integrated  flood  and  land \nmanagement. Studies will include participatory appraisals to identify the needs \nand  opportunities  for  alternative  approaches  to  flood,  land,  and  watershed \nmanagement. Flood management scenarios will be assessed, disseminated, and \nagreed by stakeholders to support the development of IFM within the selected \nfocal sub-basin. Less detailed proposals will be prepared for the two secondary \nsub-basins. \n(v)  The  TA  will  develop  detailed  flood  management  policies  and  frameworks  to \nsupport  the  mainstreaming  and  effective  implementation  of  the  integrated \napproaches within the focal sub-basin, together with broader recommendations \nfor the secondary sub-basins. It will apply the lessons learned to help the national \nand  state  governments  develop  strategies  and  reforms  to  support  the \nimplementation of IFM for sub-basins and basins through knowledge sharing and \ntraining programmes.  \n \n13.  Key  research  outputs  will  be  submitted  to  academic  journals  for  peer  review  and \npublication. The topics could include (i) effectiveness of current flood management approaches \nto hydrological changes under climate change, (ii) cost benefits of different approaches to flood \nmanagement,  and  (iii)  strategies  and  reforms  for  mainstreaming  stakeholder-led  initiatives \ntoward flood and flood plain management.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,450,000, of which $1,250,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom and $200,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund5 under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility, both to be administered by ADB. The Government of India will provide office space, \ndata, remuneration for research organizations, counterpart staff, and training. \n \n \n                                                      \n5   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Ministry of Water Resources will be the executing agency. It will appoint a technical \ndirector at a senior level to oversee TA activities. The study team will work closely with the \nCentral  Water  Commission  and  the  state  governments  to  be  selected  for  the  operational \nresearch studies. The study will build on ongoing research work being undertaken by national \nand international research organizations, including India\u2019s National Institute of Hydrology and \nother  state  water  institutes.  A  project  overview  committee  of  representatives  of  ADB,  the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom, and the government will \nmonitor TA progress. A project steering panel of specialists and selected stakeholders will \nreview and endorse the research outputs. The TA team will liaise closely with the Ministries of \nEnvironment and Forests and Science and Technology and NAPCC missions. Because the \ngovernment departments and research institutes to be involved in the project lack the necessary \nresources, the TA will require international consultants to achieve the target outputs on time. \nThe international expertise will support new methodologies, technologies, and best practices. \nPhase 2 will bring in specialist international expertise of developments in flood management \naround the world. This will enable capacity building in government departments and research \ninstitutes and the transfer of skills. The TA outputs will be disseminated through awareness \nmaterial, capacity building, training, and workshops. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented in two phases over 24 months. Phase 1 will be completed \nby month 6. It will require two international consultants for a combined total of 4 person-months \nand four national consultants for a combined total of 12 person-months. Because of the very \nspecialized work, the TA will require timely recruitment of highly qualified experts and the \npreparation of high-quality outputs in a short time. For this reason, the consultants for phase 1 \nwill be recruited individually by ADB in consultation with the government. The recruitment of \nindividual consultants will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  Phase 2 will directly follow phase 1 and will include preparation of an IFM plan for one \nfocal sub-basin. The plan will consolidate key findings of the studies and present proposals, \nincluding a well-defined information base to support decision making. A research consortium \nwith an internationally recognized portfolio of flood management research will be engaged for \nphase 2. The consortium who will be engaged by ADB will provide five international experts for \n22 person-months and 12 national experts for 84 person-months, who will be engaged using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method at a ratio of 80:20 based on a full technical proposal. \nAll equipment for the TA will be processed according to ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  TA  progress  will  be  monitored  against  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework shown in Appendix 1. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.    THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,250,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, \nand (ii) ADB administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the \nWater Financing Partnership Facility for Operational Research to Support Mainstreaming of \nIntegrated Flood Management under Climate Change, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n  \n ", "6          Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Risks \nImpact      Assumptions\nThe protection and  Flood-protected area in  State water resources  Government will adopt \nresilience of the  India increased from 22  department flood level  the implementation \nflood-prone areas in  million ha to 26 million ha  and damage reports  measures developed \nIndia is strengthened  by 2019     and published by the \n    research \nDecrease of 15% in flood- MOWR Annual Report   \nrelated property damage,    Risks \ndisruption, deaths, and  The political capacity for \ndiseases by 2019   the interagency \n  cooperation needed for \nIFM proves inadequate \n   \n   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nKnowledge of IFM for  Flood management  MOWR annual report  Stakeholders will \ndecision making and  projects in the 2014  assume ownership of \nprogram  pipeline incorporate 80%  IFM and guidelines \nimplementation is  of research outputs,  developed during the \nimproved  including best practices  TA research project \nand approaches in IFM   \n    Climate variability will \nfall within the range \n   \nprojected for the \nselected pilot-testing \nsub-basins \n \n \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
