INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) project will foster more effective \ninfrastructure  development  by  improving  the  environmental  safeguards  performance  of \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in Central and West Asia. This will be accomplished by (i) \nengaging and deploying international consultants1 and national consultants to strengthen projects \nwith respect to safeguards compliance; (ii) building on knowledge products and relationships \ndeveloped under TA 7548-REG: Improving the Implementation of Environmental Safeguards in \nCentral and West Asia 2  and TA 8663-REG Sustainable Environmental Management of Projects \nin Central and West Asia3  to further promote country ownership of sound and efficient safeguards \npractices in projects financed by the ADB; (iii) identifying gaps between local practice and ADB \npolicy, and developing a strategy to bridge these gaps in a timely manner on a project-by-project \nbasis;  (iv)  providing  specialist  technical  input  from  international  consultants  during  project \npreparation and/or implementation, where assessment gaps or potential non-compliance issues \nare identified; and (v) providing capacity building, primarily in the form of on-the-job training (OJT), \nto increase governments\u2019 understanding of how to apply environment and social safeguards. \n \n2.  This TA will aid DMCs in Central and West Asia in meeting their sustainable development \ngoals, and the TA is on the management-approved TA priority list for ADB\u2019s Central and West \nAsia Department (CWRD) for processing in 2018.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Proper  environmental  safeguard  management  during  project  processing  and \nimplementation  ensures  that  development  projects  are  implemented  in  an  environmentally \nsustainable  manner.  ADB  recognizes  the  critical  role  that  project  executing  agencies  and \nimplementing agencies play in successful environmental safeguard management. Through TA \n7548 and TA 8663, ADB has provided technical assistance to strengthen the environmental \nsafeguard capacity of executing and implementing agencies for ADB-funded projects in Central \nand  West  Asia.  These  TA  projects  have  focused  primarily  on  assessment  improvements \nobtainable under existing laws in Central and West Asian countries, such as solving administrative \nbottlenecks, improving coordination, and providing technical guidance. The achievements of \nthese TA projects have included the following: \n \n(i)  Country assessment reports were completed in six participating DMCs (Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan). \n(ii)  Thirty-eight training workshops on good practice of environmental safeguards \nmanagement and monitoring of environmental safeguards implementation were \nheld in seven DMCs (Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, \n                                                \n1  International consultants with specific expertise in Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguards application in \ncountries within the Central and West Asia region. \n2  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Improving the Implementation of Environmental Safeguards in Central and \nWest Asia. Manila (TA 7548-REG, for $800,000, approved on 21 June 2010, with a revised completion date of 31 \nMarch 201, and additional funding of $750,000 approved on 12 August 2013). \n3  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Sustainable Environmental Management of Projects in Central and West Asia. \nManila (TA 8663-REG, for $1.5 million, approved on 10 June 2014, with a revised completion date of 31 December \n2018, plus additional funding of $750,000 approved on 23 February 2016, and additional funding of $500,000 \napproved on 29 August 2017. As of 28 May 2018, the uncommitted amount is $200,135 and the undisbursed amount \nis $491,917). \n4  The TA will be financed and administered by ADB and will include no DMC government activities, financing, or \ncounterpart support. A no-objection letter will be issued informing DMCs of the proposed TA activities prior to \nimplementation. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 March 2018. \n ", "2   \nPakistan, and Tajikistan); in addition, four subregional workshops were completed \nin Kyrgyz Republic, Georgia, and Pakistan (twice). \n(iii)  A  training  manual  on  effective  environmental  management  (Environmental \nSafeguard Information Kit) was prepared and printed in English and Russian to \nhelp executing and implementing agencies comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009)  during  project  processing,  and  in  2018,  an  Environmental \nSafeguards  Monitoring  Manual  was  provided  to  executing  and  implementing \nagencies through TA 8663. \n(iv)  A network of trainers and a pool of third party auditors were established to conduct \non-the-job training and also to audit environmental management and monitoring \nreports for implementing agency staff, their consultants, and contractors.  \n(v)  The  TA  consultants  assisted  project  teams  and  borrowers  in  addressing \ncomplaints elevated to ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism through the Office of the \nCompliance Panel Review or Office of the Special Project Facilitator.  \n(vi)  OJT has proved to be the most effective component of TA 7548 and TA 8663. Both \nTA projects assisted key stakeholders with improving project preparation and \ndelivering  timely  environment  assessments  in  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Georgia, \nKyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Since February 2016, \nsupport for project processing and project administration through OJT has been \nthe primary focus of the TA 8663. \n \n4.  While TA 7548 and TA 8663 were successfully implemented, further work needs to be \ndone to improve project environmental standards in the DMCs of Central and West Asia. During \nproject processing, projects require better scoping of initial environmental examinations and \nenvironmental impact assessments to ensure that impacts are properly addressed. Executing and \nimplementing agencies must have a better understanding of international standards and the \nenvironmental impact assessment process. This is particularly relevant given the public\u2019s growing \nawareness of safeguards. Support through training and workshops is essential, especially for \nprojects that experience heavy staff turnover within the executing and implementing agencies.  \n \n5.  One issue highlighted in 2017 under the TA 8663 was the inability of ADB, executing \nagencies,  or  implementing  agencies  to  rapidly  undertake  technical  studies,  either  during \nprocessing or implementation, where existing environmental assessments were identified as \nlacking. This inability to quickly commission studies in CWRD projects caused considerable \nproject delays, and financing for such studies was a regular problem. To address this, the TA will \ninclude a technical studies facility whereby specialist studies can be commissioned at short notice, \nenabling project processing and implementation to continue with minimal disruption. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  As outlined above, the TA 8663 which is coming to an end, is working well and provides \na valuable service to DMCs during the processing and implementation of projects. ADB staff and \nexecuting and implementing agencies during project missions agreed on the relevance of these \nprevious TA projects and the need for the extension of the most useful components, which \nincluded: (i) deployment of consultants in DMCs to support project processing and implementation \nthrough OJT; (ii) workshops for executing and implementing agencies; (iii) dissemination of best \n ", "  3 \n \npractices and updates of ADB procedures; and (iv) provision of technical studies assistance for \nproblem solving. \n  \n7.  The  new  TA  will  continue  to  foster  coordination  among  national  environmental \nstakeholders, build and/or maintain stakeholder networks, and promote better understanding of \nsafeguards implementation within DMCs. The TA will also help ADB staff develop internal \nguidance notes on key environmental issues such as noise, air quality, and health and safety.  \n \n8.  In  summary,  the  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  effective  infrastructure \ndevelopment that is compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement promoted in Central and \nWest  Asia.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  quality  of  safeguard  documents  and \nsafeguard implementation in the CWRD portfolio improved.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Quality and timeliness of environmental impact assessments and initial \nenvironmental  examinations  improved.  Executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  be \nsupported by TA consultants during project processing, providing OJT and advice to improve \nproject  screening  and  scoping,  improve  the  quality  of  environmental  assessments,  and \nconsequently reduce the number of reviews and time required for approval. \n \n10.  Output 2: Quality and timeliness of environmental monitoring reports improved. \nExecuting  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  supported  by  TA  consultants  during  project \nimplementation, providing OJT to help improve the quality of monitoring reports, reduce the \nnumber of reviews prior to approval, and improve the speed at which reports are produced. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Executing  agency  performance  on  environmental  management \nshowcased. TA consultants will support executing and implementing agencies in developing \ncase studies to share as knowledge products where environmental performance has been \nexemplary, or where particular problems have been identified. TA consultants will also maintain \nenvironmental stakeholder networks in DMCs and support ADB staff in developing guidance \nnotes  on  key  environmental  issues.  Case  studies  and  knowledge  products  will  be  shared \ninternally  within  ADB  and,  where  appropriate,  will  be  disclosed  publicly  (with  government \napproval).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \n13.  There  will  be  no  government  counterpart  support  for  this  TA,  which  will  be  fully \nadministered and financed by ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Portfolio, Results, Safeguards, and Gender (PSG) Unit in \nADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will implement the TA in coordination with CWRD\u2019s \nresident  missions  and  sector  divisions.  The  PSG  Unit  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. Resident missions \n ", "4   \nwill provide country support for TA activities, including provision of work space for consultants and \nassistance in planning meetings, workshops, and training activities.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in three phases of 18 months each, considering the budget \nconstraints and better matching between TA fund availability. The first phase, with a budget of \n$750,000, will start in July 2018 and will close in December 2019. CWRD may increase the TA \namount later, subject to fund availability. \n \n16.

Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following ADB\u2019s Procurement \nPolicy  and  its  associated  project  administration  instructions  and/or  staff  instructions.  Field \nactivities will be carried out using a mix of international and national consultants to be selected \nbased on criteria including (i) existing country portfolios, (ii) upcoming country project pipeline, \nand (iii) availability of qualified consultants with relevant in-country experience. The consultants \nwill be based at resident missions and national consultants may be required to operate in more \nthan one DMC as needed.5  \n \n18.  A  technical  studies  assistance  allowance  is  included  in  the  TA.  This  will  allow  for \nexperienced international consultants to be engaged on an intermittent basis during project \npreparation and implementation to assist executing and implementing agencies in a trouble \nshooting capacity. Inputs that these experts will provide might include giving detailed advice, \ncompleting key environment assessment studies, or helping project teams address complaints or \nassessment gaps identified during implementation. \n                                                \n5 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "  5 \n \n \n19.  In addition, ADB will ask technical studies assistance experts to provide OJT training and \ncapacity-building support to executing and implementing agency staff on the application of \ninternational best practices for current and future projects.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nSupporting Environmental Safeguards in the Central and West Asia Region, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1        \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nEffective infrastructure development compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement promoted in the \nCentral and West Asia \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome  By 2019:     \nQuality of  a. 100% of EIAs and IEEs fully  a.
