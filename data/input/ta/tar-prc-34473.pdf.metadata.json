The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) had requested technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  prepare  the  Henan \nWastewater  Management  Project.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the  project  area  in \nSeptember 2003; discussed technical and socioeconomic issues with representatives  of the \ncentral, provincial, and municipal governments; and carried out an initial poverty and social \nassessment and a rapid environmental assessment. This paper is based on the understandings \nreached by the Government and Mission on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost \nestimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry program for 2003.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rapid economic growth and continuing urbanization is resulting in increasingly severe \nproblems related to water shortage and pollution, especially in northern PRC. Interruptions of \nwater supply caused by water shortages are growing in magnitude and frequency, hampering \ndomestic consumption, urban industry, and irrigated agriculture, creating severe economic \nlosses. To solve these problems, the Government is implementing a major scheme to transfer \nwater  from  the  Yangtze  River  to  northern  PRC\u2014the  South-North  Water  Transfer  Project \n(SNWTP).2    \n \n3.  Of the total river length in northern PRC, 68% is classified as unsuitable as raw water for \ndrinking water, and half the groundwater sources are polluted. The Hai River Basin (HRB), \nwhich covers Beijing and Tianjin; most of Hebei Province; and parts of Henan, Shandong, and \nShanxi provinces, is one of the three most polluted river systems,3 with more than 80% of the \nriver reaches classified as polluted. The main rivers in the basin are polluted by domestic, \nindustrial, and agricultural wastewater. The polluted surface water contaminates groundwater \nsources, on which most residents depend for drinking water. Surface- and groundwater pollution \nare also a public health problem. The Huai River Basin, which covers parts of Henan, Anhui, \nJiangsu, and Shandong, is similarly polluted. Pollution is a growing constraint on economic \ngrowth. \n \n4.  The Government is working to reduce pollution in the Hai and Huai river basins. ADB \nhas helped the Government refine its strategic plans for overall management of HRB.4 The \nGovernment\u2019s efforts have focused on large industrial sources in the provincial cities of Beijing \nand Tianjin, and major cities in Hebei Province, which have launched large-scale wastewater \ntreatment plant construction programs. Despite considerable reduction of pollution from these \nsources, water quality has continued to deteriorate, indicating that many other sources are \ncontributing to water pollution. Reduction of pollution and/or discharges from secondary cities is \nessential to improve water quality. \n \n5.  Nonpoint water pollution due to fertilizer and pesticide runoff, and discharges from \nintensive animal production is worsening. Nonpoint sources of nutrients are significant sources \nof eutrophication in many lakes throughout the PRC and also in shallow near-shore marine \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 2002. \n2 This scheme comprises the eastern, central, and western routes. The eastern and central routes have started \nconstruction, with a completion target by 2010.  \n3 The others are the Huai and Liao river systems.  \n4  ADB.  1998.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nareas that experience limited tidal flushing. Bohai Bay is susceptible to eutrophication as \nindicated by the frequent occurrence of red tide. ADB has helped the Government address \nnonpoint water pollution control at a policy level.5  \n \n6.  The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) formulated the Tenth Five-\nYear Plan of Water Pollution Prevention and Control in HRB (2001\u20132005). The plan identified \nseveral key actions: (i) reduce the gross amount of pollutants, (ii) protect drinking water source \nareas, and (iii) solve transboundary water pollution disputes.6 The strategy\u2019s fundamental parts \ninclude  integration  of  municipal  and  industrial  wastewater  treatment  and  establishment  of \neffective  wastewater  enterprises  with  sound  cost  recovery  to  ensure  sustainable  facility \noperations and to contribute to capital investment. To solve similar water pollution issues in the \nHuai River Basin, SEPA also formulated the Huai River plan. Pollution control as part of water \nresources management is a top priority in the Tenth National Five-Year Plan. \n \n7.  Henan covers the upper parts of the Hai and Huai river basins, and the lower part of the \nYellow  River  Basin.  The  northern  part  of  Henan  within  HRB  includes  the  secondary \nmunicipalities of Anyang, Jiaozuo, Puyang, and Xinxiang. The main rivers in this part of the \nbasin flow into the Wei River and Zhangweinan Canal, and then eventually into Bohai Bay. Like \nother parts of HRB, this sub-basin is severely polluted. Water in the Hai and Huai river basins \ndoes not meet the minimum standards as a raw water source for drinking water or even for \nagricultural  use.  Pollution  control  is  of  particular  importance  due  to  the  relevance  of  the \nwatercourse to boundary disputes between Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, mainly caused by \nupstream pollution and the planned use of the watercourse as part of  SNWTP\u2019s eastern route.  \n \n8.  The major factors in the rapid deterioration of surface and groundwater quality are \nineffective regulatory control of municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, inadequate \nwater resources management, and financial weakness of municipal service providers. Demand \nfor water for domestic and industrial use has steadily increased, putting more pressure on water \nresources. Wastewater, and its associated pollution loads, has increased rapidly. Only a small \nproportion of wastewater flows are treated to comply fully with discharge standards, largely the \nresult of ineffective enforcement of environmental regulations and inadequate environmental \ninfrastructure investment. \n \n9.  The Henan provincial government (HPG) has thus formulated the Henan Hai and Henan \nHuai river plans. Both require all municipalities to have at least one wastewater treatment plant \nby 2005, and all counties to have at least one wastewater treatment plant by 2007. Both plans \nalso require all municipalities to establish wastewater companies and introduce wastewater \ntariffs before building wastewater treatment plants. ADB has played a leading role in helping the \nPRC formulate national wastewater tariff guidelines.7 In the PRC, a wastewater tariff can be \nintroduced once a project proposal to construct a wastewater treatment plant is approved. \nWastewater tariffs are applied in the four representative project municipalities. Tariff levels8 are \nnot enough for future debt service or for operation and maintenance of project facilities. Tariffs \nwill be adjusted to implement the ensuing project and to ensure that the poor can access the \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

Both  plans  require  all  industries  to  meet  national  effluent  discharge \nstandards.9  \n \n10.  To  achieve  construction  targets,  23  county-level  projects  in  five  municipalities  are \nproposed in the Henan Hai River plan. Of the 23 projects, 6 are being implemented with national \nfunds, 7 in four municipalities are proposed for ADB financing under the ensuing project, and \nthe remaining 10 will be implemented with other domestic financing sources. The projects for \nADB financing were selected based on the relevance and importance of the projects to the \nHenan Hai River plan, financial and institutional capacity of the concerned municipality to \nimplement  the  projects,  and  preparedness  of  the  projects.  The  municipalities  prepared \npreliminary feasibility studies. For industrial pollution control, 49 industrial wastewater treatment \nprojects proposed in the Henan Hai River plan are in progress with domestic financing sources. \nAdditional projects may be identified for the Henan Huai River plan.  \n \n11.  The initially identified projects will help the governments of Anyang, Jiaozhou, Puyang, \nand  Xinxiang  municipalities  formulate  more  effective  regulatory  control  of  municipal  and \nindustrial wastewater discharges, and introduce the principle of integrated water resources \nmanagement and pollution control. The projects will help improve the quality of surface and \ngroundwater in and downstream of the project municipalities, and urban environment and public \nhealth through improved wastewater management. The projects will also help improve the \nquality of life for the urban poor by reducing waterborne diseases, safeguarding the quality of \ndrinking water, and improving wastewater services. \n \n12.  Most Henan municipality government public utility bureaus and/or urban construction \nbureaus are responsible for municipal sewerage and wastewater treatment. In anticipation of \nthe ensuing project, the project municipalities have established wastewater companies. Their \nultimate goal is to operate as autonomous state-owned enterprises, with their own boards of \ndirectors, and to control all income received from wastewater tariffs.  \n \n13.  One of ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the PRC is to enhance environmental protection \nand natural resources management. The ensuing project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy. The \nproject will improve living conditions and the health of the people of Henan, and enhance water \nresources  management  in  the  Hai  and  Huai  river  basins  to  improve  the  environment  for \nsustainable long-term economic growth. Related policy dialogue is being pursed in the following \nareas: (i) integrated water resources management for groundwater resources and irrigation \nrequirements,  (ii)  transboundary  pollution  control,  (iii)  integrated  domestic  and  industrial \nwastewater management, (iv) solid waste management in the context of groundwater pollution, \n(v) regulatory enforcement and monitoring, (vi) enterprise reform and corporate governance, \n(vii) cost recovery and tariff reform, and (viii) private sector participation.  \n \n14.  ADB has been involved in water resources management and pollution control in HRB \nsince 1992. ADB has financed nine PRC water supply and wastewater management projects \nwith  a  total  loan  of  $1,085  million  since  1993.  Two  have  helped  improve  wastewater \nmanagement in Hebei Province and Tianjin. ADB has provided two advisory TAs10 for water \n                                                 \n9  During the Ninth National Five-Year Plan, all industries were required to treat their wastewater to national effluent \nstandards by 31 December 2000. About 90% of the industries reportedly complied. However, the actual figure \ncould be lower than this due to ineffective regulatory control.  \n10 ADB. 1992.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n15.  The  purpose  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  is  to  help  the Government prepare an \ninvestment project for wastewater management and pollution control in Henan, covering, among \nothers, Anyang, Jiaozuo, Puyang, and Xinxiang. The output will be workshops and a series of \nreports recommending a project suitable for ADB financing. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will assess the feasibility of the seven representative projects in HRB, which \nwere proposed by HPG for wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal through a review of \nsewerage  master  plans,  industrial  wastewater  pollution  control  plans,  domestic  feasibility \nstudies, environmental impact assessment reports, resettlement plans, and related studies. The \nTA will develop selection criteria for additional similar projects in the Huai and Yellow river \nbasins in Henan, and prepare a list of indicative projects to be implemented under the project. \nThe TA will also identify policy measures and institutional development needs that will improve \nwastewater services; ensure financial sustainability; and identify the social dimensions to be \nincorporated in the project design, including measures proposed to enhance social development \nand reduce poverty. The initial poverty and social assessment carried out during the Mission for \nthe  representative  projects  is  in  Appendix  2.  Key  TA  activities  will  include  field  surveys; \ndocuments review; data analysis; and consultation with stakeholders, including government \nofficials, project beneficiaries, and affected people.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million equivalent, comprising $550,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $450,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $800,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, \nand $250,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB's TA funding program. The Government has agreed to provide the balance of local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $200,000 for counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative \nsupport services, and logistics. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinancing any ensuing project.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  HPG will be the project Executing Agency. A project management office (PMO) will be \nestablished, and the director of the HPG Environmental Protection Bureau will be the PMO \ndirector. PMO staff will come from the HPG Financial Bureau, Planning Commission, and \nConstruction Department. The PMO will be in charge of overall project coordination, and will \ncooperate with the consultants and ADB. Project municipalities will establish similar project \nmanagement offices. A project leading group (PLG)\u2014composed of the Henan vice governor; \n ", "    5 \nstaff from the HPG Environmental Protection Bureau, Financial Bureau, Planning Commission, \nand Construction Commission; and project municipality vice mayors\u2014will be formed to guide \nand support the project. The PMO will be the PLG\u2019s secretariat. \n \n19.  A firm of international consultants, in association with domestic consultants, will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and its \nBorrowers, based on the quality- and cost-based selection method and  other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The TA will require 45 person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services\u201418  person-months  international  and  27  person-months \ndomestic.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  wastewater  management, \nenvironment,  social  analysis,  financial  analysis,  and  economic  analysis.  The  domestic \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  engineering  services  (wastewater  management,  sewer \nnetwork, costing, mechanical, electrical, and instrumentation); environment; sociology; financial \nanalysis; and economic analysis. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in \nAppendix 4. Since the tasks and methodology are well defined, engagement of consultants will \nfollow the simplified technical proposal procedure. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, from March to August 2004. The consultants \nwill submit inception, interim, draft final, and final reports. The findings will be presented at \ninterim and draft final workshops. PLG members; representatives of the Ministry of Finance, \nmunicipal governmental agencies, and local communities; and ADB staff will participate in the \nworkshops. \n \nIV.

Review of Sector Development Plans \n \n1.  The  consultants  will  review  long-  and  medium-term  plans  for  water  resources \nmanagement and pollution control in the Hai River Basin (HRB), focusing on the part of Henan \nProvince within the basin, and downstream beneficiaries. Among others, reference will be made \nto the Henan Hai River plan, which is part of the Tenth Five-Year Plan of Water Pollution \nPrevention and Control in HRB (2001\u20132005) The consultants will also refer to consultants\u2019 \nreports prepared under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) advisory technical assistance \n(ADTA).1 Based on the review of these plans, the consultants will assess Henan provincial \ngovernment  (HPG)  policies  and  strategies  for  water  resources  management  and  pollution \ncontrol to ensure that a comprehensive approach has been adopted throughout the river basin, \nand all appropriate options have been considered on a least-cost basis. The consultants will \nrecommend any changes in policies and strategies, and improvements to these plans as a \nconsequence of the recommended changes in policies and strategies.  \n \n2.  The consultants will analyze wastewater management practice in representative project \nmunicipalities  in  the  context  of  basin-wide  water  resources  management,  including  water \nsupply,  irrigation,  and  industrial  use.  Reference  will  be  made  to  sewerage  master  plans, \nindustrial wastewater pollution control plans, and various feasibility studies, where these exist, \namong others. Based on the analysis, the consultants will recommend improvements to these \nplans,  including  policies  and  strategies  for  wastewater  management.  The  representative \nprojects will be evaluated in the context of these plans. Based on the evaluation, the consultants \nwill undertake technical, environmental, social, financial, economic, and institutional feasibility \nstudies of the representative projects. \n \n3.  For the Huai and Yellow river basins, the consultants will conduct a similar exercise for \nthe additional projects to be included under the project. For the Huai River Basin, reference will \nbe made to the Henan Huai River plan, among others, which is the implementation plan for the \nHuai River plan. Based on the initial exercise, the consultants will develop selection criteria for \nthe additional projects and prepare a list of indicative projects to be implemented under the \nproject. \n \nB.  Technical Aspects    \n \n4.  The consultants will review domestic project proposals, feasibility studies, environmental \nassessments, and resettlement plans for all the representative projects, and other related \nreports used to substantiate the analyses of the feasibility studies. Major water users and major \neffluent discharges will be identified to evaluate the overall environmental impacts and benefits \nof the representative projects.
