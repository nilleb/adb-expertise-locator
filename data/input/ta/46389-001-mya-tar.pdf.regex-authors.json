The Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar has requested assistance \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  strengthen the  ability  of  the  National  Energy \nManagement Committee (NEMC) to prepare policies and strategies in the energy sector and to \nhelp formulate a long-term energy master plan.1 The government has agreed to the impact, \noutcome, outputs, and key activities of ADB\u2019s proposed technical assistance (TA), which are \npresented in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1.2 \n \n2.  In line with major government reforms to move the country toward a democratic political \nsystem and a market-based economy, ADB adopted a phased approach in February 2012 to re-\nengagement with Myanmar. ADB has since prepared an initial assessment of the country\u2019s \nenergy sector. 3 It showed the need for a more detailed, comprehensive assessment of the \nsector, the revision of existing policies and strategies, and preparation of long-term plans for \nsustainable energy development. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership \nstrategy for Myanmar for 2012\u20132014.4 The strategy\u2019s aims are to build human and institutional \ncapacity in ADB\u2019s areas of focus and strength as ADB re-engages with the country and to lay \nthe foundation for further medium-term support and effective development processes.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Myanmar has abundant energy development potential, particularly in hydropower and \nnatural gas. The rivers that drain the main Ayeyarwady, Chindwin, Thanlwin, and Sittaung \nbasins  are  estimated  to  offer  scope  for  more  than  100,000  megawatts  in  hydroelectricity \ngeneration, and 92 large-scale hydropower projects with a total installed capacity of 46,101 \nmegawatts have already been identified. Proven natural gas reserves total 11.8 trillion cubic feet, \nand the potential for additional discoveries is considered by the government. Offshore gas is the \ncountry\u2019s most important source of export revenue. Myanmar now supplies gas to Thailand and \na new gas pipeline to the People\u2019s Republic of China is being planned. The oil and gas sector \naccounts for  one-third of foreign  direct  investment,  or  $13.6  billion, from  January  1995  to \nSeptember 2011. Myanmar is one of the five major energy exporters in Southeast Asia.  \n \n4.  Despite  these  large  energy  resources,  Myanmar\u2019s  commercial  per  capita  energy \nconsumption is the lowest in Southeast Asia. This is due to its low per capita income and lack of \nenergy infrastructure. The electrification rate5, for example, is only 26%. The government has no \nenergy balance data. The limited data on energy that exists are scattered between government \nministries. This has forced ADB to rely on secondary sources for energy information. According \nto the International Energy Agency, Myanmar\u2019s total primary energy supply in 2009 was about \n15.1 million tons of oil equivalent.6 The country\u2019s primary energy supplies come from biomass \n(69.9%), gas (18.2%), oil and petroleum (8.6 %), hydropower (2.4%), and coal (0.9%). Energy \nconsumption expanded at an annual average of 2.4% during 2000\u20132009. The highest growth \nwas in the commercial sector, followed by the industrial and transport sectors. The residential \n                                                \n1  During an ADB mission in February 2013, the Ministry of Energy, which was originally to be the executing agency, \nasked that National Energy Management Committee (NEMC) take on this responsibility instead. Established on 9 \nJanuary 2013, the NEMC will take charge of energy policy formulation and long-term energy planning.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 February 2013. \n3  ADB. 2012.

Paris. \n ", "2   \nsector, which is the largest consumer of energy (mainly through its use of biomass), showed the \nslowest growth. \n \n5.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  (MOE)  has  set  the  basis  of  Myanmar\u2019s  energy  policy \nframework\u2014(i) fulfilling domestic energy requirement, (ii) implementing the status of sustainable \nenergy development, (iii) promoting the wider use of new and renewable sources of energy, (iv) \npromoting  energy  efficiency  and  conservation,  (v)  promoting  use  of  alternative  fuels,  (vi) \nimplementing  effective  utilization  of  discovered  crude  oil  and  natural gas  resources  in the \ninterest of the entire nation, and (vii) promoting more private participation. The energy sector \ncurrently lacks the  overall planning, policies, and strategy needed to achieve these goals. \nMedium- and long-term planning for subsectors and the sector overall is limited and fragmented. \nNo clear policies or programs exist for planning the sector\u2019s development, achieving energy \nefficiency, promoting renewable energy, or addressing climate change in 2011.  \n \n6.  Responsibility for energy sector matters is divided among seven line ministries. The \nMOE is a focal point for coordinating policy and planning by the concerned ministries but it has \ndone little of either, except in regard to oil and gas. The MOE has not given priority to its \nresponsibility for national energy planning. The other responsibilities are divided between (i) the \nMinistry of Electric Power\u2015the power sector7; (ii) the Ministry of Mines\u2015coal development; (iii) \nthe Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation\u2013micro-hydro for irrigation purposes, and biofuels; (iv) \nthe Ministry of Science and Technology\u2015renewable energy; (v) the Ministry of Environmental \nConservation  and  Forestry\u2015fuelwood,  climate  change,  and  environmental  safeguards \nrequirements;  and  (vi)  the  Ministry  of  Industry\u2015energy  efficiency.  The  lack  of cohesion  is \nexacerbated by the fact that the separate functions of policy making, regulation, and operation \nand maintenance have been mixed together within the seven ministries.  \n \n7.  To  address  this  fragmented  approach  and  ensure  that  the  energy  sector  and  the \nelectricity subsector are developed in a coordinated way, the Office of the President authorized \nformation of the NEMC and the Energy Development Committee (EDC) in January 2013. The \nNEMC comprises 14 members: vice president (2) as patron, the minister of energy (chairman), \nthe minister for electric power (vice-chairman), nine members,8 the deputy minister of energy \n(secretary), and the deputy minister of electric power (joint secretary). The NEMC\u2019s main duties \nare to (i) formulate national energy policy and energy regulation for ensuring implementation of \nthe  energy  policy;  (ii)  supervise  the  facts  and  figures  on  accurate  energy  statistics;  (iii) \ncoordinate  with  the  country\u2019s  Privatization  Commission  and  the  Myanmar  Investment \nCommission on privatization; (iv) carry out oil and gas production through local and international \ninvestments, in accordance with international regulations; (v) adopt convenient pricing policy for \nconsumers and investors, depending on international prices; (vi) assess the environmental and \nsocial impacts in a region before implementation of an energy project and inform the people in \nthe project area of the results; (vii) enforce energy sufficiency ambition and reduce energy \nwaste; (viii) solicit foreign and local investment in energy sector development and increase \nforeign direct investment; and (ix) make arrangements for drafting necessary laws, rules, and \nregulations related to the energy sector. \n \n                                                \n7  The Ministry of Electric Power No.1 and The Ministry of Electric Power No.2 were merged as the Ministry of \nElectric Power in September 2012. \n8  Other members  include  the  ministers of agriculture  and  irrigation,  environmental conservation  and  forestry, \nindustry, mines, national planning and economic development, and science and technologies. U Myint Soe (Senior \nGeologist of Geological Survey and Minerals Exploration Department; U Win Kaing, Chairman of Myanmar \nEngineering Society; and U Ang Myint, General Secretary of Renewable Energy Association Myanmar. \n ", "  3 \n8.  The EDC will act as a working level committee of the NEMC. It comprises the minister of \nenergy as chairman, the director general of the MOE\u2019s energy planning department as secretary, \nand 12 other members.9 The government established a secretariat for the NEMC and EDC \nwithin  the  MOE  with  staff  seconded  from  concerned  ministries.  The  secretariat  will  be \nsupervised by the deputy minister of the MOE. The institutional strengthening of the newly \nestablished NEMC and EDC and of the ministries involved in energy planning and policy is \nurgently needed for sustainable development of the energy sector in Myanmar.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  an  improved  policy  and  planning  environment  for \nsustainable development of the energy sector in Myanmar. The outcome will be strengthened \ninstitutional arrangements for energy planning and enhanced staff capacity within the NEMC, \nthe EDC, and the ministries concerned with energy matters.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA has the following outputs: (i) Output 1: established coordination mechanism and \ninstitutional arrangement for the energy sector; (ii) Output 2: improved policy frameworks for \nenergy policy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy development strategy; (iii) Output 3: \nprepared medium-term capacity development plan in the energy sector; (iv) Output 4: prepared \na 20-year energy master plan; and (v) Output 5: enhanced staff skills for energy  planning \nthrough training. \n \n11.  Key activities for outputs 1, 2, and 3 include: (i) reviewing the existing institutional \narrangements for the energy sector and strengthen the current coordination mechanism among \nNEMC, EDC and concerned ministries in preparing and implementing energy policy, particularly \nrenewable  energy  development;  (ii)  identifying  weaknesses  and  recommend  necessary \nmeasures  to  enhance  staff  capability;  (iii)  preparing  immediate  and  medium-term  capacity \ndevelopment plans for sustainable development of the energy sector; and (iv) assisting the \ngovernment in preparing sector assessment, strategy and road map for the energy sector, and \npreparing  and/or  revising  the  energy  policy  and  strategy,  energy  efficiency  policy,  and \nrenewable energy development strategy of the Government. \n \n12.  For outputs 4 and 5, key activities include: (i) consolidating the existing fragmented \nmedium- and long-term energy plan within the concerned ministries and agencies; (ii) preparing \na 20-year energy master plan for each primary energy subsector and the energy sector as a \nwhole, including demand projections, supply options with required investment, and financing \nmodalities in line with Myanmar\u2019s national development plan; and (iii) training concerned staff in \nNEMC, EDC, and concerned ministries to enhance necessary staff skills in dealing with long-\nterm energy planning and prepare capacity development plan for energy planning activities. In \nthe donor coordination meeting in September 2012, it was agreed with the Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) that this TA will complement JICA\u2019s work in preparing the long-term \npower sector expansion plan.  \n \n                                                \n9  Other members include deputy ministers of agriculture and irrigation, environmental conservation and forestry, \nelectric power, energy, and industry; directors general from the Ministry of Mines and the Ministry of Science and \nTechnologies; and five civil experts. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,450,000 of which, $1,350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart salaries and office space and other in-\nkind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The executing agency will be the MOE through the NEMC and the implementing agency \nwill be the MOE through the EDC. The TA will be implemented from May 2013 to October 2014. \nIndividual consultants and a team of consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will require \n32 person-months of international consultancy and 40 person-months of national consultancy. \nThe  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  and  recruit  the \nconsultants,  manage  the  contract  administration,  and  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the \nconsultants deliver the TA reports. The training and workshops, conferences, and a survey will \nbe administered by the consultants. \n \n15.  Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time). On completion of the TA, all equipment will be turned over to the \nNEMC.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n16.  Several  interactive  public  stakeholder  discussions  will  be  held  with  civil  society \norganizations, development partners, and the government during formulation of the energy \npolicy, the energy efficiency policy, the renewable energy development strategy, and the draft \n20-year energy master plan. Approved policies and strategies will be disclosed to the public \nthrough electronic media in both English and the Myanmar language, as well as through other \nmeans appropriate to reaching other interested stakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE RANKING VICE-PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The  Ranking  Vice-President,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, and acting under the authority \ndelegated by the Board, has approved ADB administering technical assistance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $1,350,000 to the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar to be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for  Institutional \nStrengthening of National Energy Management Committee in Energy Policy and Planning, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2016    Assumption \nImproved policy and  A new energy policy, a  Government policy and  Government remains \nplanning environment  new energy efficiency  strategies  committed to \nfor sustainable  policy, and a renewable    sustainable \ndevelopment of the  energy development  development of the \nenergy sector in  strategy are approved.  energy sector. \nMyanmar     \nOutcome  By end 2014    Assumption \nStrengthened  An energy planning unit is  Government policy and  Government remains \ninstitutional  created.  strategies  committed to new \narrangements for    institutional and legal \nenergy planning and  arrangements for the \n   \nenhanced staff  energy sector. \ncapacity within the  Implementation of     \nNEMC, the EDC, and  medium-term capacity \nRisk \nthe ministries  development plan has \nconcerned with energy  begun.
