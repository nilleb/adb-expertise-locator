INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to enhance the ability of criminal court judges to render informed \ndecisions  on  court  cases  involving  charges  of  economic  crime.  ADB  fielded  a  mission  to \nMongolia in May 2015 and reached an understanding with the government on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for consultants. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2015 for Mongolia.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The rule of law is fundamental to sustainable economic development.3 Well-functioning \nlegal and judicial systems encourage investment and competition by protecting property and \ncontractual rights, ensuring impartial court decisions well-founded in law, and reducing the risk \nof  political  and  economic  instability.  While  legislation  that  incorporates  market  economic \nprinciples is essential to foster a robust business environment and economic growth, laws \nthemselves  cannot  be  effective  without  reliable  legal  institutions.  Judicial  systems  play  an \nimportant role in this regard by assuring that these laws are properly applied.  \n \n3.  Mongolia  has  made  a  rapid,  peaceful  transition  to  parliamentary  democracy  and  a \nmarket economy since the adoption of a new constitution in 1992. Government and institutional \nstructures  have  been  remodeled,  and  the  new  constitution  established  a  new  legislative \nframework. A series of justice sector reforms developed and improved the legal system and \nbrought it into line with democratic values and a market economy. Notable among them were \nthe adoption of a legal reform program in 1998, the development of a strategic plan for the \njustice system in 2000, and a program to deepen judicial reforms in 2010. These programs \nincreased judicial independence, began modernizing the court system, and developed greater \njudicial capacity. Gaps have remained, however, particularly in the legal and judicial systems\u2019 \nabilities  to  play  their  important  role  in  ensuring  that  economic  development  has  a  strong \nfoundation  in  effective  rule  of  law.  As  has  occurred  in  many  other  economies  that  have \nundergone  substantial  structural  transitions  in  a  short  time,  Mongolia\u2019s  judiciary  is  having \ndifficulty coping with a new legal environment that has been altered by swift political, economic, \nand social change. International development partners, including ADB, have been helping to \ndevelop reforms and build capacity in the legal and judiciary systems,4 but most judges find it a \nchallenge to apply a new set of laws designed for an unfamiliar market system.5  \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 September 2015. \n2  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2015. Manila. \n3  Rule of law is the principle that all individuals, institutions, and government are subject and accountable to laws that \nare clear and fair, that protect fundamental rights, and that are implemented and enforced by competent and \nindependent functionaries. \n4  The United States Agency for International Development supported the government develop legal and justice \nsector reform strategies during 1994\u20132008. The World Bank worked to enhance transparency and accountability of \njustice sector institutions in 2001 and 2008. German development cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fbr \nInternationale  Zusammenarbeit  and  the  Hanns-Seidel  Foundation  have  provided  justice  sector  capacity \ndevelopment projects since 1995 and helped the country carry out its sector reform agenda. \n5  The judicial decisions in Mongolia on commercial law matters were among the weakest in the transition economies \nin a region that included member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Georgia. A judicial \nskills gap in commercial law matter was one of the key attributes for poor quality court decisions in Mongolia. European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). 2011. Court decisions in commercial matters: an EBRD \nassessment. In A. Colman, ed. Law in Transition 2011. London: EBRD. http://www.ebrd.com/documents/legal-\nreform/court-decisions-in-commercial-matters-an-ebrd-assessment.pdf \n ", "2 \n4.  Mongolia\u2019s court system has three tiers. First-instance courts are established in the \nsoums (districts), and appellate courts are in the aimags (provinces) and in Ulaanbaatar. Above \nthem is the country\u2019s Supreme Court. Mongolia will have separate civil and criminal courts and \njudges under a new law governing courts that became effective in July 2015.6 This will enable \njudges to concentrate on and accumulate expertise in the assigned field of the law. One result is \na surge of demand from judges for training in their particular assigned jurisdiction. About 480 \njudges held office in 2014, including 170 criminal court judges. Business and economic matters \nare governed by civil law and courts in Mongolia except when they involve charges of economic \noffences listed under the Criminal Code of Mongolia. The forms of business-related misconduct \ncategorized  as  economic  crimes  in  Mongolia  include  noncompliance  with  auditing  rules, \nbankruptcy fraud, and tax evasion. \n \n5.  The Judicial General Council of Mongolia (JGC) is an organization mandated by the \nConstitution that aims to ensure the political, legal, and financial independence of the judiciary \nand the impartiality of judges. It is responsible for managing and supervising the judicial system, \nappointing and removing judges, and ensuring that judges and judicial staff are properly trained \nand qualified. In cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and \nthe International Development Law Organization, the JGC provided training in commercial law \nfor  civil  court  judges  in  two  phases  during  2012\u20132014.  About  half  of  Mongolia\u2019s  judges \nparticipated in all or parts of this effort to build their abilities to apply civil business and economic \nlaws. However, the JGC has noticed that criminal court judges have limited experience in and \nexhibit a lack of understanding of the dynamics of economic crime. Although still small in \nnumber, incidents of economic crime have been increasing. As a result, the government asked \nADB to provide support for judicial training to ensure fairer and more consistent court decisions \nin cases involving economic crime. Making the judiciary more able to apply and enforce the \neconomic aspects of the criminal code will help strengthen governance and the rule of law in \nMongolia.  \n \n6.  The  government\u2019s  national  development  strategy,  2008\u20132021  makes  effective \nadministration of justice based on the rule of law a priority.7 The government launched its \nprogram to deepen judicial reforms in 2010, calling for further improvement in the independence \nof the judiciary. The TA will support this government\u2019s strategy by making the justice system \nmore efficient and transparent. The TA is also aligned with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership \nstrategy  2014\u20132016  for  Mongolia,  which  emphasizes  good  governance  and  capacity \ndevelopment as a thematic driver of change.8 \n \n7.  ADB  support  for  Mongolia\u2019s  legal  and  judicial  sector  reform  efforts  includes  its \nassistance in 1993 to develop a legal framework and in 1998 to establish the Legal Retraining \nCenter  that  provided  continuing  education  for  legal  professionals  in  commercial  law  and \nregulations. ADB has also helped enhance legal efforts to combat money laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism.9 The TA will continue ADB\u2019s effort to promote reform and build capacity in \nMongolia\u2019s legal sector. \n                                                \n6  Government of Mongolia. 2015.

The  impacts  will  be  the  promotion  of  effective  administration  of  justice  and  the \nstrengthening of the judiciary\u2019s independence. The outcome will be the strengthening of the \njudiciary\u2019s capacity to adjudicate economic crime cases.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will support the JGC in its development and provision of sustainable judicial \ntraining on economic crimes through (i) an assessment of the training needs, (ii) the training of \ntrainers (TOT), and (iii) the development of a curriculum and training material. The training will \nstrengthen the capacity of criminal court judges to render informed decisions on economic crime \ncases. \n \n10.  Output 1: Judicial training needs analyzed. Consultants will be engaged at the outset \nof TA implementation to organize focus group discussions with judges, lawyers, and other \nstakeholders to briefly assess judicial knowledge of economic crime and the skills gap. Activities \nunder output 1 will help the JGC identify and prioritize training in areas where judges need to \nbuild capacity. The consultants will prepare a short report that includes (i) the assessment \nmethodology; (ii) the assessment of the training needed, based on the perspectives of judges, \nlegal professionals, and the business community; (iii) the plan and design of a TOT program, \nincluding a detailed program outline, schedule, evaluation form, and proposal for any resource \npersons needed; and (iv) a preliminary outline of the training curriculum. The report will also \nidentify any online training opportunities. The TOT program will cover at least three topics \nrelated to economic crimes in the criminal code, which may include intentional bankruptcy and \ntax evasion. \n \n11.  Output 2: Legal and interdisciplinary knowledge of trainer judges strengthened. \nThe JGC will select and nominate 30 sitting judges as candidates to become trainers. The \nselection criteria and a list of qualified candidates will be submitted for ADB\u2019s prior clearance. \nBased on the TOT program developed under output 1, the JGC will organize training workshops \nfor the candidate trainer judges. The workshops will build the candidates\u2019 legal knowledge of the \nlaws and regulations on economic crimes, as well as the interdisciplinary awareness of business \nand accounting that is needed to understand evidence in adjudicating these cases. Consultants \nand resource persons will be engaged to deliver training and presentations on important topics. \nThe resource persons will include lawyers, professors, and officers and regulators concerned \nwith economic law. \n \n12.  Output 3: Judicial training curriculum and training materials developed. Based on \ntheir performance in the workshops, the JGC will select up to 15 of the 30 candidate trainer \njudges to take part in the next step of the process. Using the needs assessment carried out \nunder output 1, the JGC and the selected trainer judges will design a curriculum and training \nmaterials on economic crime with the support of the TA consultants. TA consultants will help \nensure the overall quality of the training material, which will be designed to enable judges to \nstudy on their own. Workshops will be organized for feedback on the designed curriculum and \ntraining materials. The training material that emerges from this process will be compiled into two \nhandbooks covering legal and interdisciplinary topics and be printed for dissemination. The JGC \nwill organize sessions at which the trainer judges will provide training for other criminal court \njudges using the curriculum and materials they and the TA help to develop. \n ", "4 \n13.  The risks to the success of the TA project are (i) the chance of political change that \ndiminishes the government commitment to judicial reform and/or reduces budget allocations \nneeded  to  sustain judicial  capacity  development,  (ii)  any  change  in the  JGC\u2019s  institutional \nmandate or leadership that impedes project implementation, and (iii) the possibility that the JGC \nwill be unable to retain the trained trainers to continue the transfer of the project-developed \nknowledge and skills to their fellow criminal court judges. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  access  to  data  sources,  office \naccommodation,  training  and  workshop  venues,  office  equipment  and  supplies,  secretarial \nassistance, logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 28 months from 1 December 2015 to 31 March 2018. \nThe executing agency will be the JGC, which will be responsible for (i) selecting the trainer \njudges, (ii) monitoring the quality of the training materials produced under the TA, and (iii) \ncontinuing the training program after the TA project ends.  \n \n16.  The project will require the services of three international consultants for 7 person-\nmonths  and  three  national  consultants  for  11  person-months.  They  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime),  and  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Individual recruitment will be \nemployed to meet the project\u2019s particular requirements regarding each consultant\u2019s experience \nand qualifications. Resource persons will also be engaged to provide additional specialist inputs \nin the capacity development activities. ADB will establish an advance payment facility with the \nexecuting agency to administer activities related to the project workshops, subject to its capacity \nto complete the activity and liquidate the advance. \n \n17.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs on the agreed timeline and budget. ADB will assist the executing \nagency in overall TA operations, and TA review missions will be conducted to help monitor \nprogress. To support monitoring and evaluation, the consultants will submit inception, midterm, \nand final reports to the executing agency and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Strengthening the Capacity of Judicial Training, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with \n1.
