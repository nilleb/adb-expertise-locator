INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) have regularly requested ADB support in climate risk management and accessing climate \nfinancing.  As  a  response,  ADB  has  incorporated  climate  risk  management  as  a  standard \npractice in investments, and has facilitated access to international climate financing, primarily as \ninvestment cofinancing.  \n2.  New climate finance mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) will likely be \nmajor sources of financing. Given ADB\u2019s accreditation in March 2015 as an implementing entity \nof  the  GCF\u2014the  first  for  a  multilateral  development  bank\u2014it  is  likely  that  ADB  will  face \nincreasing  demands  for  assistance  from  Pacific  DMCs  with  regard  to  climate-related \ninvestments that are supported by international climate finance sources. At their May 2015 \nmeeting,  Pacific  DMC  governors  requested  specific  support  for  accessing  the  GCF  and \nexpanding support for climate risk management. This technical assistance (TA) will respond to \nthis request by building the capacity of Pacific DMCs to better manage climate and disaster \nrisks and access climate financing, which is critical for expanding climate change actions and for \nimproving resilience of investments in the Pacific.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The small size, remoteness, and fragile biodiversity of Pacific island countries make \nthem  exceptionally  vulnerable  to  natural  hazards  and  climate  change,  but  they  have  low \ncapacity to manage the resulting risks. Climate change is increasing the risk associated with \nnatural hazards. Increasing variability in rainfall patterns is increasing the risk of floods and \ndroughts, increased ocean temperatures and ocean acidification are leading to coral bleaching \nand destruction of natural coastal barriers, and sea level rise is contributing to coastal erosion \nand salt water intrusion. These changes have increased the region\u2019s exposure and vulnerability \nto disasters brought about by weather events such as tropical cyclones and storm surges, which \nhave inflicted significant losses on fragile Pacific economies. A single disaster event has the \npotential  to  erode  many  years  of  economic  development  gains  by  damaging  critical \ninfrastructure,  destroying  livelihoods,  and  diverting  resources  from  development  spending \ntoward disaster response and reconstruction efforts.  \n4.  Physical infrastructure associated with transport, energy, water supply and sanitation, \nand  human  settlements  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  disaster  risks. \nAdaptation measures to increase the resilience of infrastructure to both disaster events and \nlong-term climate change may involve a significant incremental cost in addition to the underlying \ninfrastructure investments. In a review of ADB investment projects across sectors spanning the \nperiod 2010 to 2012, it was found that climate-proofing measures represented on average 8.4% \nof total capital cost. For water investment projects alone, the average climate-proofing cost \nreached 31% of capital cost. According to the ADB report on Economics of Climate Change in \nthe Pacific,2 the Pacific region would require $447 million on average every year until 2050 \n(approximately 1.5% of gross domestic product) to prepare for the worst climate scenario, and \nthe cost could be as high as $775 million per year or 2.5% of gross domestic product per \nannum. Given the very large and growing adaptation needs in the Pacific, significant amounts of \nadditional financing must be mobilized.  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section \nof ADB\u2019s website on 18 December 2014. \n2  ADB. 2013. The Economics of Climate Change in the Pacific. Manila. \n ", " 2 \n5.  The TA will strengthen the resilience of investments in the Pacific by (i) incorporating \nclimate change and disaster risk management (DRM) considerations into project designs, (ii) \nstrengthening the capacity to integrate climate change and DRM considerations in government \nplanning processes in key sectors in selected countries, and (iii) supporting access to climate \nchange financing. Target DMCs and investment projects will be proposed based on climate and \ndisaster risk screening, and the adaptation priorities of Pacific DMCs.3 \n6.  This TA will expand ongoing climate change activities in the region\u2014such as the Pacific \nRegional Strategic Program for Climate Resilience,4 and ongoing climate proofing activities \nassociated  with  ADB  investments\u2014and  build on  the  experience  of the  Pacific  Department \n(PARD) with international climate change funds, such as the Climate Investment Funds, and the \nLeast Developed Countries Fund of the Global Environment Facility. The TA will promote a \ncloser working relationship with partner organizations in the production and dissemination of \nspecific climate information relevant to investment projects, and promote regional cooperation \nand knowledge sharing on climate change and DRM in Pacific DMCs. The TA will also build on \nsupport to GCF and climate finance readiness provided to some Pacific countries by ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department.5  \n7.  The TA responds to the priorities identified in the Regional Operations Business Plan for \nthe  Pacific,  2015\u20132017.6 The TA  also  supports the  national  adaptation  priorities  of Pacific \nDMCs, and ADB\u2019s Interim Pacific Approach 2015.7 As the TA support will be directly linked to \npipeline investments and key sectors where ADB is providing investment support in the Pacific, \nthe focus is consistent with country partnership strategies and Pacific Approach priorities.   \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be strengthened integrated risk management to enhance the climate and \ndisaster  resilience  of  Pacific  DMCs.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  climate  and  disaster \nresilience of investments in Pacific DMCs. This will be measured by Pacific DMCs adopting \nprocedures for incorporating climate and disaster risk management into sector investments, and \nincreased flow of climate change financing to selected countries.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will have three main outputs: \n10.  Output  1:  Climate  change  and  disaster  risk  management  incorporated  into \ninvestments in the Pacific. The TA will support mainstreaming of climate change and DRM \ninto ADB investments through specific support to project teams and implementing agencies. \nThe support may include carrying out climate risk and vulnerability assessments; identifying \ndisaster risks based on assessments carried out by DMCs, development partners and ADB; \nidentifying climate and disaster-proofing options in investments, including engineering solutions \nand ecosystem-based adaptation options, as well as incorporating gender considerations; and \nsupporting economic analysis of projects and estimating the incremental costs of adaptation and \n                                                \n3 TA activities in DMCs will be initiated only after a no-objection letter has been obtained from the government. \n4 ADB. 2013.

The adaptation options are identified and prioritized based on their technical feasibility \nand  economic  viability,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  climate  risk  management  approach.8 \nAlthough climate proofing could increase the upfront costs of the infrastructure projects, such \ncosts should be economically justified by lower total life cycle costs and by the high probability \nof climate-related damage. The economic analysis aims to identify which adaptation option \nyields the highest net benefit, and it can also point to the best timing for investing in adaptation. \n11.  The TA will also review PARD experience on climate change and the Pacific Climate \nChange  Implementation  Plan,  and  provide  recommendations  for  updating  the  plan  or \nincorporating  it  into  the  Pacific  Approach.  The  TA  will  also  include  communication  and \ndissemination  of  lessons,  and  produce  regional  knowledge  products  or  studies  on  climate \nchange and climate and disaster proofing at the project level, to inform output 2 activities for \nsupporting government sector-level mainstreaming. \n12.  Output  2.  Capacity  to  integrate  climate  and  disaster  risk  management  in \ngovernment  planning  processes  strengthened.  Based  on  the  output  1  project-level \nexperiences on climate and disaster proofing, the TA will develop sector-level guidance, tools or \nplans for incorporating climate and disaster risk management into investments in priority sectors \nin selected Pacific DMCs, and provide related capacity building activities. Target DMCs and \nsectors will be proposed based on an assessment of vulnerable sectors and linkages with \nexisting investments. Key activities could include review and assessment of sector planning \nprocesses, and development of new or improvement of existing tools for incorporating climate \nand disaster risk management, including gender considerations, into planning and investments \n(such  as  climate  risk  screening  tools,  project  appraisal  tools,  and  guidance  on  economic \nanalysis or monitoring and evaluation). The TA will also include capacity building in applying the \ntools,  strengthening  institutional  arrangements  and  policy  support  for  sector-level \nmainstreaming, and promoting regional cooperation and sharing of lessons.  \n13.  Output 3. Access to climate change financing supported in selected countries. \nThe TA will support access to climate financing to cover the incremental costs of climate change \nin investments. Road maps or project pipelines for accessing climate finance in Pacific DMCs \nwill be developed, as well as support for development of financing proposals to access GCF or \nother climate financing resources. The TA will also identify opportunities for regional initiatives \non climate change and DRM in the Pacific. Target sector investments will be proposed based on \nthe  risks  and  vulnerabilities  of  the  investments,  and  government  priorities  for  adaptation, \nfollowing discussions with DMC authorities and regional organizations. The climate financing \nproposals  will  be  developed  in  close  coordination  with  the  Sustainable  Development  and \nClimate Change Department and the GCF secretariat. \n14.  The TA is based on the assumption that the current high interest among Pacific DMCs to \nmanage climate and disaster risks and to access a greater volume of climate finance through \ninternational finance mechanisms will continue. Potential risks are related to climate finance \nmechanisms not being accessible as anticipated, due to (i) lack of financial commitment by \ndeveloped countries to GCF and other climate funds; (ii) excessive delays in the implementation \nof  international  climate  finance  mechanisms  such  as  the  GCF;  and  (iii)  DMC  investment \npriorities failing to correspond to those of climate finance sources. The TA is not expected to \nlead to any safeguard risks. \n                                                \n8 http://www.adb.org/publications/climate-risk-management-adb-projects.  As  an  example,  for  a  transport  sector \nproject investing in bridge infrastructure, adaptation measures to respond to increased risks of flooding might \ninclude engineering solutions such as building a higher bridge, or flood control measures such as improvements in \ncatchment management.   \n ", " 4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB, through PARD, will be the executing agency and will exercise overall responsibility \nfor coordination, supervision, and implementation of all project activities, while the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department will provide technical support. The TA will be \nimplemented over a period of 39 months. The activities are expected to commence in October \n2015 and to be completed by 21 December 2018, with the closing of TA on 29 April 2019. \n17.  The TA will finance consulting services, workshops, regional knowledge products or \nstudies, and report preparation. A team of international and national consultants will be engaged \nto assist in TA implementation. The team will include an international climate change specialist \nand team leader (15 person-months, intermittent) and a national project coordinator (35 person- \nmonths), recruited following individual consultant selection; and various international climate \nchange, DRM or relevant sector specialists to be recruited through indefinite delivery contracts \nto flexibly respond to the project and DMC needs (15 person-months). For the indefinite delivery \ncontracts, full terms of reference will be developed during implementation based on project \nneeds, and lump-sum contracts may be used. The outline terms of reference for consultants are \nin Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will be made in accordance \nwith the ADB Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n19.  The TA will include communication and dissemination of lessons through knowledge \nproducts  on  climate  change  and  climate  and  disaster  proofing  at  the  project  level,  and \nmainstreaming at the sector level. The project will be monitored principally through project-level \nreports, as well as reports from climate finance mechanisms (e.g., GCF reports). Results will be \ndisseminated through workshops and publications. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening Climate and Disaster Resilience of Investments in the Pacific, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nStrengthened integrated risk management to enhance climate and disaster resilience (Draft Strategy for \nClimate and Disaster Resilient Development in the Pacific)a  \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome   By 2018:     \nClimate and disaster  a.
