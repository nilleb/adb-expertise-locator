INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under  its  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Nepal  for  2013\u20132017,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)will  focus  on  supporting  accelerated,  sustainable,  and  inclusive \neconomic growth by helping to enhance economic opportunities and access to jobs through \ninvestments in physical and human capital.1To achieve these goals, the CPS emphasizes the \nneed to improve the portfolio performance of projects funded by ADB. During ADB\u2019s 2014 \ncountry programming mission, the Government of Nepal requested a technical assistance (TA) \nto develop critically needed capacity in key agencies and meet an immediate requirement for \nbetter investment planning and project preparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \nThe impact, outcome, outputs, costs and financing plan, implementation arrangements and \nterms of references of the TA were discussed and agreed with the government. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nepal has been undergoing a challenging political transition since armed civil conflict \nended in the country in 2006. Prolonged efforts have been made to promulgate a federal \nconstitution,  with  the  latest  target  date  in  early  2015.  During  this  transition,  Nepal  has \nmaintained macroeconomic stability. The annual growth rate in real gross domestic product \n(GDP) averaged 4.4% during 1996\u20132011, and the poverty rate fell sharply from 42% to 25% \nover this period. Nepal will likely to meet more than half of the Millennium Development Goals. \nThe country continues to face significant development challenges, however, it is still far from \ngraduating from the least-developed country category. While reduced, poverty remains high, \nand  socioeconomic  disparities  between  geographical  regions  and  social  groups  are  wide. \nAchieving a government goal of graduating from the least-developed country status by 2022 will \ncall for much faster and more inclusive employment-centric growth. \n \n3.  In pursuing higher and more inclusive economic growth, the government\u2019s low capital \nexpenditure and an inability to use allocated budget fully and effectively remain a major concern. \nPublic capital expenditure was only 3.3% of GDP in FY2014 and averaged only 4.0% of GDP \nduring FY2009\u2014FY2013. By comparison, the rate in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were about 7% \nover  the  same  period.  The  government  has  increased  its  budget  allocation  for  capital \nexpenditure in FY2015 by 82.8% over the FY2014 revised estimate. This would be equivalent to \n5.4% of GDP, but the poor capacity of its agencies to absorb these funds and spend them in full \nis challenging. Only 75.0% of the planned capital expenditure budget for FY2014 was used, and \nthe average utilization rate during FY2009\u2014FY2013 was only 67.2%. Among other things, this \nreflects persistent weaknesses in public financial management and project implementation.  \n \n4.  To enhance its capital spending and address the country\u2019s infrastructure deficit, the \ngovernment needs to prepare a pool of projects that are ready to be implemented. This requires \nthe establishment of project preparatory facilities for critical infrastructure sectors. While ADB is \nproviding support in this area through the project design advance facility, the government needs \nto apply project readiness filters more systematically to reduce the start-up delays, which remain \ncommon, and improve the performance of projects. It also needs to make its annual budget \npreparation  and  approval  processes  more  efficient  and  effective  by,  among  other  things, \nimproving the coordination and monitoring among the National Planning Commission (NPC), the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), and the line ministries. A better management information system \n(MIS) that can support the government\u2019s budgetary approval and monitoring processes more \neffectively is also required.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2013\u20132017. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 November 2014. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  As a least developed country, the government agencies need strong support to build \ntheir  implementation  capacity,  particularly  in  planning,  preparation,  procurement,  and \nimplementation for government projects. A lack of proper procurement plans of the projects \nmakes it difficult for the government agencies and ADB to monitor procurement activities and \nmanage  contracts.  A  particular  concern  is  the  poor  enforcement  of  the  country\u2019s  public \nprocurement act and regulations. Some steps have been taken toward e-procurement, such as \na rollout of electronic submission of bids for government procurement in 2013, but the human \nresources and abilities of the central regulating agency\u2014the Public Procurement Monitoring \nOffice (PPMO)\u2014remain weak. The PPMO has not yet established an effective mechanism for \nmonitoring the procurement performance of government executing and implementing agencies \nat large, and it suffers from a high turnover of key officials. Procurement capacity is also low in \nthe country\u2019s local government bodies. The lack of trained procurement personnel and weak \nfinancial  management  expose  government  spending  to  high  fiduciary  risks.  In  2011,  ADB \nhelped PPMO\u2019s initiative for capacity building through a TA to train the government staff at the \nNepal Administrative Staff College.3 \n \n6.  Poor performance by contractors and consultants continues to impair many projects of \nthe governments including those funded by development partners. The current qualification \nrequirements and other procurement criteria are inadequate, and do not address these issues, \nwhich  include  the  absence  of  a  lead  firm  for  projects,  delays  by  contractors  in  deploying \nequipment and personnel, and unauthorized changes in personnel. Penalties are limited, and \nthese problems lead to project delays and cost overruns. The performance of consultants is also \noften poor, with a high turnover of key personnel and weak supervision and management by \ngovernment  implementing  agencies.  These  issues  are  systemic,  and  to  address  them  the \ngovernment needs to have more stringent qualification criteria, better contract administration, \ngreater oversight by its executing agencies, and a sound system for monitoring and evaluating \nthe performance of both contractors and consultants.  \n \n7.  Reflecting these overall problems, the portfolio performance of ADB-assisted projects in \nNepal has been weak. As of 31 October 2014, of the ADB\u2019s active portfolio of $1.8 billion\u2014that \ncomprises  39  investment  projects\u2014only  43%  is  contracted  and  29%  disbursed.  Nepal's \ndisbursement performance was weaker than those of other developing member countries of \nADB in the South Asian subregion. At disbursement ratio of 16.3% in 2013, it was also lower \nthan the overall ADB average of 21%. The weak performance is closely linked to the common \nstart-up delays and slow procurement, which translate into time extensions. Most ADB projects \nin Nepal are not completed on time.  \n \n8.  To improve the ADB portfolio\u2019s performance, it is imperative that procurement, project \nmanagement,  contract  management,  fiduciary  oversight,  and  financial  management  be \nimproved,  and  that  the  capacity  of  executing  agencies  and  implementing  agencies  be \nstrengthened in these areas. Project preparation and readiness must also improve. This calls for \npreparation of a pool of implementation-ready, high-priority infrastructure projects; and steps to \nupgrade the MOF and the NPC systems for allocating, monitoring, and supporting the spending \nof government budgets. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n3 ADB. 2009. Regional Technical Assistance on Asia Pacific Procurement Partnership Initiative. Manila. \n \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be enhanced capital expenditure in Nepal. This will be measured against \ntargets  for  an  increased  capital-expenditure-to-GDP  ratio  and  a  higher  utilization  rate  of \nallocated budget. The outcome will be the improved portfolio performance of ADB-assisted \nprojects.4 The  TA  will  aim  to  help  increase  the  contract  award  ratio  to  27%  and  the \ndisbursement ratio to 24% by 2018. It will also target a reduction in the time required for \ndisbursing 10% of these project funds to 12 months and that needed to disburse 30% to 24 \nmonths. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will deliver three outputs through the methodologies and activities detailed in \nparas.11 to 16. \n \n11.  Output 1: Project budgetary and monitoring process improved. The TA project will \nassess the existing arrangements for budget preparation, allocation, appropriation, approval, \ntransfer, execution, and monitoring by the MOF and the NPC. It will identify gaps or bottlenecks \nand devise ways to accelerate fund use by the executing agencies of the government projects. \nA web-based reporting system will be set up for real-time monitoring and intervention by the \nhigh-level implementation review committees established by the government to monitor their \npriority projects. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Action  plan  for  enhancing  capital  expenditure  of  key  infrastructure \nsectors developed and implementation started. In priority sectors such as transport, energy, \nurban  and  rural  infrastructure,  the  TA  project  will  assess  the  existing  sector  investment \nstrategies and plans, project pipelines, and institutional setup. This will include an evaluation of \ncurrent human resources for project planning and implementation, and asset management. \nBased on the findings, the TA project will develop roadmaps or action plans to enhance sector \ncapital expenditures. It will also help begin implementation of the road map or action plan. It will \ndevelop  specific  recommendations,  which  may  include  the  need  for  institutional  reforms, \nadditional  resources for  strengthening  sector  investment  plans, the  development  of  project \nbanks or a pipeline of readily implementable projects, and a human resources strategy for \nachieving higher investments through increased deployment of project engineers and/or use of \nconsultants.  TA  implementation  will  include  consultations  with  the  important  stakeholders, \nincluding the government, development partners, local think-tanks and experts, and consultant \nand contractor associations. \n \n13.  Output 3: Capacity of executing and implementing agencies improved. The TA \nproject\u2019s primary focus will be on delivering this output by (i) improving the overall procurement \nsystem,  (ii)  building  capacity  in  project  implementing  institutions,  (iii)  improving  project \nimplementation  guidelines,  (iv)  establishing  a  procurement  accreditation  system,  and  (v) \nstrengthening the MIS. These are primarily aimed to strengthen the capacity of the executing \nand  implementing  agencies  of  the  projects  assisted  by  ADB.  The  first  step  will  be  the \npreparation of a medium-term risk-reduction action plan. The plan will specify measures to be \ntaken by project agencies and contractors for enhancing thresholds for post-review of national \nand  international  competitive  bidding.  The  TA  will  help  the  agencies  concerned  begin \n                                                \n4  The assistance by ADB and World Bank accounted for more than 50% of capital expenditure (with almost equal \nshares) over the past years. Therefore, improvement in the performance of ADB (and WB) portfolio can have \nvisible impacts on percentage of capital expenditure against GDP.  Further, the issue of low capital expenditure is \nclosely associated with low absorptive capacity or portfolio performance of ongoing projects, as opposed to the \nresource availability, which is also seen in the country's fiscal balance which remains very low deficit or even \nsurplus in the recent years. \n \n ", "4 \n \nimplementing these measures. This will be based on outcome of the country procurement risk \nassessment done by Operations Services and Financial Management Department of ADB in \n2014. \n \n14.  Learning from the experience of the Capacity Development Resource Center (CDRC) \nestablished in ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission, the TA project will set up a similar center in ADB\u2019s \nNepal  Resident  Mission  with  the  support  and  guidance  of  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Department \n(SARD). As part of the CDRC activity, the TA project will establish a capacity assessment and \nmonitoring system for individual executing agencies and implementing agencies and use the \nsystem\u2019s  findings  to  establish  annual  training  calendars.  Training  will  be  developed  and \ndelivered, mainly on government and ADB procedures and system for procurement, consultant \nselection,  accounting,  financial  reporting  and  management,  disbursement,  safeguards,  and \ncontract administration. Training material prepared for the ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission CDRC \nwill be used when appropriate. An annual calendar of the training sessions will be provided to \nthe executing and implementing agencies to help them plan their participation. Training will use \nthe Federation of International Consulting Engineers conditions of contract, project management, \nand technical audit. Additional thematic training will cover gender empowerment and social \ninclusion, good governance and anticorruption measures, and sector-specific subjects such as \nsustainable asset management and user cost recovery. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s  Nepal  Resident Mission  will  facilitate  these  programs through  its sector  and \nthematic  staff  and  national  consultants.  The  TA  project  will  also  engage  national  and \ninternational  training  agencies  and  academic  institutions  to  provide  the  training.  National \nconsultants provided under the TA will support for procurement and contract management, \nparticularly for new ADB-assisted projects. Business opportunity seminars will also be held to \nimprove the participation of contractors, consultants, and nongovernment organizations in ADB-\nfunded projects. Under this output\u2019s activities, the TA project will review the existing standards \nand manuals for preparing construction programs, controlling and managing work progress and \nquality, recording the works completed, and undertaking technical auditing of infrastructure \nworks. Based on the findings, it will prepare improved guidelines and manuals and give the \nrelevant training to the staff of the executing and implementing agencies, contractors, and \nconsultants of ADB-assisted projects. Because many ADB-assisted projects are completed late, \nthe TA project will establish appropriate tools to monitor the progress and performance of \nindividual contracts and supervision consultants. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  prepare  proposals  for  establishing  national  accreditation  systems  for \nprocurement  and  construction  supervision  to  the  government  staff  involved  in  the \nimplementation of ADB-assisted projects, in coordination with the PPMO, academic institutions, \nand  engineer  associations.  Following  which  a  program  for  accreditation  systems  for \nprocurement and construction supervision will be launched. Finally, the TA will support the \ncreation  of  database  and  establishment  of  MIS  to  record  past  and  ongoing  contracts  of \ncontractors and consultants, including progress and performance. The MIS will be managed by \nthe Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,650,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, counterpart staff, facilities for seminars \nand meetings, and other in-kind contributions. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2015\u20132017 for Nepal.5 The detailed cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014.

The MOF will be the executing agency responsible for \nproviding the strategic direction for implementation of the TA. ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission will \nmanage  and  oversee  TA  implementation,  working  closely  with  TA  beneficiaries  to  ensure \neffective use of TA resources. The beneficiaries of the TA will be the PPMO, the NPC, the MOF, \nand the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, and Transport. The TA will be implemented from 1 \nJanuary 2015 to 31 December 2017.  \n \n19.  Consulting services. The project will require 20 person-months of international and 117 \nperson-months of national consultant services, with total of 137 person-months. Consultants will \nprovide specialized inputs for capacity development and institutional strengthening. Consultants \nwill be recruited by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). Given the diverse nature of the deliverables, some of the experts \nmay need to be recruited individually for activities such as coordinating the training. A firm will \nbe selected under quality- and cost-based selection system and the weighting of the technical \nand  financial  proposals  will  be  90:10.  To  reduce  the  administrative  burden  and  improve \neconomy and efficiency, consulting services under the TA may be engaged on lump sum, \noutput-based contracts when appropriate. The CDRC capacity development training activities \nare  expected  to  be  delivered  through  the  Nepal  Administrative  Staff College,  which  is  an \nautonomous training entity designated by the government to develop and conduct appropriate \ntrainings to government staff. The college may be selected to provide training through a single \nsource selection procedure.6 The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA-funded training will be implemented in close coordination with and under the \nguidance of ADB\u2019s South Asia Department. Information will be exchanged with other resident \nmissions, particularly the ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission, for mutual learning and the sharing of \nbest practices. ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission will organize training programs with the help of \nresource  persons from ADB,  national  consultants,  and  institutes  in  Nepal  and  neighboring \ncountries. Disbursements under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  The consultant will discuss with the TA beneficiaries and provide ADB and MOF with an \ninception report and quarterly progress reports that stipulate the overall work plan, progress of \nwork, and proposed actions for the next quarter. This is aimed at ensuring good quality and \ntimely delivery of milestones for all the envisaged activities. Training materials will be printed \nlocally and posted on ADB and MOF\u2019s website. An annual capacity development report will be \nprepared by the team leader to document improvement in the portfolio performance of ADB-\nassisted projects, the training programs conducted, feedback from participants, best practices, \nand sector and thematic knowledge developed. The report will be published and disseminated \nto all stakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Enhancing Portfolio Performance, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                \n6  The Nepal Administrative Staff College has been proposed by government to conduct selected training.
