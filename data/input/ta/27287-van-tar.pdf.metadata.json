During the Bank's 1996 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the Republic\nof Vanuatu requested assistance to help prepare the Outer Islands Infrastructure Development\nProject, aimed at facilitating equitable economic development and trade among Vanuatu's outer\nislands. During July-August 1998 the Bank technical assistance (TA) Fact-finding Mission 1 held\ndiscussions with Government representatives and reached an understanding on the objectives,\nscope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for the Project Preparatory Technical\nAssistance.2\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Republic of Vanuatu is an archipelago of 80 mountainous islands in the southwest\nPacific (see Map). The country's total population in 1999 is about 185,000 and the population\ngrowth rate is about 2.9 percent. The eight largest islands (Ambae, Ambrym, Efate,\nErromango, Espiritu Santo, Malakula, Pentecost and Tanna) constitute almost 90 percent of the\ncountry's land area and are inhabited by 80 percent of its population, most of which is located\nalong the seacoast. There are only two urban centers - the capital, Port Vila on Efate with\n30,000 people, and Luganville on Espiritu Santo with 10,000; both are growing rapidly. The rest\nof the population lives in towns and villages, often with populations of only a few hundred\npersons. The proposed project will help provide alternatives to out-migration from the outer\nislands.3\n3. The social structure of village communities and the desire to preserve ni-Vanuatu\ntraditional values, are both assets and constraints. The fruits of an individual's efforts are likely\nto be shared by many members of a clan as part of a wide range of obligations, which provides\na social safety net. Communities may also plan and implement small development projects\nsuch as a footpath, footbridge, or boat landing. Most land is held under custom (village)\nownership. This facilitates land management by the community, but often makes land\nacquisition more time-consuming since the purchaser must often deal with a number of custom\nowners of the same piece of land.\n4. Vanuatu has abundant land and natural resources. Although 45 percent of the total land\narea (an estimated 5,500 square kilometers) is arable, only about 15 percent is utilized,\nindicating considerable potential for expansion. The climate, rich soil, location, and relatively\npest-free and unpolluted environment are conducive to the development of agriculture,\nlivestock, and forestry. The territorial waters and associated large exclusive economic zone\nand reefs are as important as a potential resource for fisheries.\n5. Agriculture is the mainstay of Vanuatu's economy. Major crops include copra; cocoa;\ncoffee; kava; vegetables such as yam, cassava, and sweet potato; and fruits such as papaya.\nCattle raising has also proven successful. About 25 percent of marketed copra and cocoa and\n70 percent of cattle are raised on plantations, and the balance by smallholders. Much of\nsmaliholder production is on gardens in newly cleared forestland, allocated to users by each\n1\t Comprising Jeifry R. Stubbs, Regional Representative, and Peter Hunt, Senior Project Implementation\nSpecialist. The mission had been postponed pending implementation of other projects.\n2\t The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities ir September 1996.\n3\t The outer islands comprise all islands except Efate.", "2\nvillage following traditional custom rights and privileges. Forestry is important particularly on\nthe larger islands such as Efate and Espiritu Santo. Tourism is an important growth industry\nand revenue earner on many islands, where the combination of natural beauty and custom\nlifestyle provides much of interest to the tourist. Fishery, mining, and manufacturing are all\nunderdeveloped.\n6. Trade between the islands is dominated by copra. Other frequently traded items include\ncocoa, coffee, kava, fruits and vegetables, canned meats and fish, sugar, household goods,\nclothing, fuel, machinery, motor vehicles, and livestock. In most areas, goods are carried on\nfoot to transfer points and then (i) by small boats to coastal or interisland vessels, or (ii) by truck\nor bus after which they are transported to a nearby village or town. Air transport is sometimes\nused for high-value commodities such as kava.\n7. Vanuatu's high cost and inefficient coastal and interisland shipping services are a\nserious constraint on the transport of crops and other agricultural produce from, as well as the\nsupply of food, fuel, and other necessities to, the outer islands. Most of the ships are old,\npoorly maintained, and in need of replacement. Although the larger, more central islands\nreceive services at intervals of a week or less, the smaller, more remote islands may be served\nonly once every several months. There are two international seaports, at Port Vila and\nLuganville. Although wharves and jetties have been constructed on most of the larger islands,\nthese are not always functional and small boats are often used to carry goods and people to\nships anchored off the coral banks that surround most of the islands. The Government is\naware of the need to improve interisland shipping, and is considering opening the sector to\ninternational companies, and increasing the number of international ports. The Port Act, the\nCoastal Trading Act and Shipping Regulations are being revised, and a Maritime Authority has\nbeen created to regulate sea traffic.\n8. About 22 of Vanuatu's 80 islands have roads, many of them constructed during the\nSecond World War. While some urban roads are paved with asphalt, most are constructed of\ncoral. Although the main road network is in most cases adequate to handle existing traffic,\nfeeder roads in many areas are needed to service developing agricultural, fishing, and tourism\nareas, and roads and bridges must be upgraded to accommodate heavier vehicles, eliminate\nhazardous crossings or alignments, and provide better drainage. Road maintenance is at\npresent very poor, and needs to be put on a sustainable basis\n9. Air services are reasonably good. There are three international airports, (on Efate,\nEspiritu Santo, and Tanna), and 26 domestic airstrips, of which 11 are regularly serviced and\n15 have variable service. Some of the domestic airstrips need improvement to facilitate all-\nweather service.\n10. Power services are available only in Port Vila and Luganville; although these are\nreliable, they are costly. Water supplies are available in Port Vila, Luganville, and a few other\ntowns and villages. They are of good quality only in Port Vila, where treatment is provided\nregularly, and in a few of the smaller towns, where supplies are from the ground and do not\nrequire treatment.\n11. Agricultural research and extension centers have been developed on the larger islands,\nand these are complemented by producer and consumer cooperative associations. A ni-\nVanuatu business development center is being developed Although funding is available to", "3\nagricultural producers through their cooperative associations and credit unions, little is available\nfrom financial institutions. There is a substantial need to improve agricultural, small business,\nand cooperative associations; enhance extension programs; and improve financing\narrangements.\n12. Vanuatu's local government institutions comprise six provinces, two municipalities (Port\nVita and Luganville), and about 800 villages. Until recently, the roles of each had been unclear.\nMost development projects were developed by politicians or central Government agencies, and\nformal consultations with local government institutions were infrequent. Under recently\nprepared budget guidelines, however, local governments are being given the opportunity to\nprepare projects and the responsibility to prepare budgets. A Decentralization Act is also being\nprepared.\n13. The Bank has supported a multiproject loan,1 covering roads, wharves, schools, and\nother infrastructure, as well as loans for Santo port2 and urban infrastructure.3 Wharves\nconstructed under the multiproject loan were rated as unsuccessful since they were often poorly\nlocated with respect to either the community or the sea. Such facilities, if recommended under\nthe TA, will be scrutinized carefully. All the loan projects have required fairly substantial\nadjustment of designs during implementation, evidence of a need to improve preparation of\ndetailed designs before project approval. Bank lAs have supported preparation of\nrecommendations for strengthening the Public Works Department (PWD), a national transport\ndevelopment plan, and an interisland shipping study. 4 A telecommunications master plan was\nprepared with United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) assistance in 1987; an airport\ndevelopment program was prepared with Agence Francaise de Developpement assistance in\n1996; a utilities policy framework was prepared with World Bank assistance in 1998; and a land\nuse planning project is under way with Australian Agency for International Development\n(AusAlD) assistance. Together, these loans and TAs form a strong and comprehensive basis\nfor the TA. The Bank's TA for the interisland shipping study recommended the actions\ndescribed in para. 7 and the TA for strengthening the PWD led to its recent reorganization and\nthe introduction of contracting-out procedures for road maintenance.\n14. Within the above-described framework, the TA will help assess in more depth the\ninfrastructure constraints of the outer islands, particularly those related to the expansion of\nmarkets, development of tourism, agriculture, forestry and fishing, improved operations and\nmaintenance (O&M), and improved policies and institutional arrangements. Care will be taken\nto ensure that the recommended improvements are based upon well-balanced assessments of\ndevelopment needs and community aspirations, and are sustainable\nLoan No. 766-VAN, Multiproject for $3 million, approved in December 1985.\nLoans Nos. 843-VAN, Santo Port, and 1080-VAN, Santo Port (Supplementary), for $9.15 million, approved\nin September 1987 and March 1991.\nLoan No. 1448-VAN, for $10 million, approved in June 1996.\nTA No. 901-VAN, Institutional Strengthening of Public Works Department, for $325,000, approved on 29\nSeptember 1987; TA No. 965-VAN, Preparation of a National Transport Development Plan, for $350,000,\napproved on 28 March 1998; and TA No. 1525-VAN, Inter-island Shipping Study, for $525,000, approved\non 21 June 1991.", "4\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n15. The TA will assist the Government to (i) assess the infrastructure constraints to more\nrapid economic development of the outer islands; (ii) assess and make recommendations for\nadjusting the policies governing coastal and interisland shipping, to make it more competitive\nand efficient; (iii) design and cost a project to undertake the priority infrastructure investments\nincluding improved O&M to support economic growth in the outer islands; and (iv) help prepare\nthe project-related components of a national infrastructure master plan that specifies the\nGovernment's policies, strategies, and priority investments for the medium term.\nB.\t Scope\n16. The scope of the TA will include (i) inventorying, mapping, and analyzing the physical\nfeatures, economic production, trade, traffic, land-use, infrastructure, and land development\ncharacteristics of various provinces and islands; (ii) identifying the economic development\nprospects of each province, major island, and development area; (iii) consulting with village\ncommunities, provinces, private developers, and nongovernment organizations to identify\ninfrastructure development needs and potential projects; (iv) assessing coastal and interisland\nshipping sector policies, regulations, markets, and providers, and developing recommendations\nfor making the sector more competitive and more efficient; (v) undertaking feasibility studies for\nmajor infrastructure components, including engineering, environmental, social, financial,\neconomic, and sustainability assessments, and preparation of the related preliminary designs and\ncostings; (vi) preparing detailed designs and bid documents for selected components; (vii)\nassessing institutional arrangements to maintain, operate, and recover the costs of this\ninfrastructure and make recommendations for low-cost, sustainable options; (viii) helping draft the\nproject-related components of a national infrastructure master plan that will identify key policies,\nstrategies, and priority investments; (ix) recommending a port development plan for Port Vila; and\n(x) preparing an investment project for consideration by the Government and the Bank including\nbackground, objectives, scope, cost, financing plan. implementation arrangements, and\njustification.\n17. The TA will be carried out in three phases. In the first phase (about three months) visits\nwill be made to all the provinces; consultations will be held with community groups and\nprovincial governments; priority proposals will be identified; and levels of service provision,\ninstitutional, and financial arrangements will be surveyed. Based upon the findings, alternative\nproject configurations will be prepared; these may range from a strong focus on new\ninvestments to a focus on O&M and related institutional strengthening. Policy and institutional\nissues will be detailed for further consideration, and lists of subprojects will be assembled. In\nthe second phase (three months) feasibility studies of major and high-priority components will\nbe prepared, surveys will be carried out, and the project scope and costs will be defined in more\ndetail. Economic and financial internal rates of return will be estimated as necessary to\ndetermine if the various subprojects are justified. Environmental and social impact\nassessments will be prepared as a part of the feasibility studies and for the Project as a whole.\nIn the third phase (two months) detailed designs and implementation arrangements will be\nprepared and the project costs will be refined. Loan fact-finding is planned for the end of the\nsecond phase, while the consultant team is still in the field, Low-cost, sustainable solutions", "5\nimplemented within sound and appropriate policy and institutional framework will be sought.\nTerms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 1.\n18 The project ensuing from the TA may comprise (i) policy reforms; (ii) high priority\ninfrastructure investments; and (iii) institutional strengthening, capacity building and finance. The\ninfrastructure investments are anticipated to include rehabilitation/upgrading of main roads, feeder\nroads, airstrips, and wharves. Consideration will also be given to integrated infrastructure and\nservice provision in developing areas. The project will cost about $8 million to $12 million and\nmay be financed with the assistance of a $5 million to $8 milhon Bank loan in the year 2000.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19 The TA is estimated to cost a total of $883,000 equivalent, comprising $658,000 in foreign\nexchange and $225,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested the Bank to\nfinance $750,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, and $92,000 equivalent of\nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis from the Bank-\nfinanced TA Program. The balance of the local currency costs, equivalent to $133,000, will be\nfinanced by the Government, through the provision of office space, counterpart and support staff,\ntransport for Government staff, facilities, materials, and support services. The Government has\nbeen advised that approval of the TA does not commit the Bank to finance any ensuing project.\nThe cost estimates for the TA are given in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n20 The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Department of Economic and Social\nDevelopment (DESD), of the Ministry of Finance. The Implementing Agency (IA) for the first\nphase of the TA will be DESD. The IA for the second and third phases of the TA will be the PWD\nof the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU) or another line agency selected at the\nend of phase 1, depending upon the conclusions of the TA at that stage. DESD will provide\ncoordination between the agencies concerned with the Project, including the Ministry of Finance;\nMinistry of Agriculture; MIPU; Ministry of Internal Affairs; Ministry of Natural Resources, Land and\nEnvironment; other concerned departments; and the TA consultants. To facilitate TA\nimplementation and coordination, DESD will establish a project steering committee (PSC)\ncomprising representatives of these agencies to guide implementation. The IA will serve as\nSecretary to the PSC, and manage the work of the consultants including coordination with the\nprivate sectors, nongovernmental organizations, and communities, on a daily basis. The IA will\nassign a full-time project coordinator to supervise the TA and staff, and provide furnished office\nspace, and other office and communications facilities to assist the consultants. Each participating\nprovincial government will establish a working group to facilitate implementation at the local level.\nThe TA is expected to be completed in June 2000.\n21. The TA will be implemented over a period of about 10 months, by a team of international\nand domestic consultants. For this purpose, a consulting firm will be selected by the Bank in\naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. An estimated 20.5 person-months of\ninternational consulting services will be required, together with some 6.0 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services. International consultants inputs will provide expertise in rural and\nagricultural development, road and airstrip engineering, ports and wharf engineering, shipping\npolicy and economics, project economics, financial analysis and institutional development, and\nenvironmental and social analysis. Domestic consultants will provide expertise in rural community", "6\ndevelopment and participation, mapping, and drafting. Three reports will be produced during the\nconduct of the TA: a Phase 1 report covering the demand assessments and optional project\nconfiguration; a phase 2 report covering the shipping and feasibility studies, and a phase 3\nreport describing the recommended project in standard Bank format, and the infrastructure\nmaster plan. In addition, the consultants will produce monthly progress reports describing\nresults achieved, inputs provided, and issues encountered. Each major report will be provided\nto the PSC, for review before finalization. Each monthly report will be provided for information\nto the PSC. Tripartite reviews will be held at the end of each phase of the work.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n22. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance to the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 for the purpose of preparing the Outer\nIslands Infrastructure Development Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board. This\ntechnical assistance will be financed initially as a grant, but will be subject to the reimbursement\narrangements set forth in the Board Papers on Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R51 -77,\ndated 20 May 1977) and Streamlining of Technical Assistance Operations (Doc R44-88, dated\n21 March 1988) including the provision that, in the event of the technical assistance resulting in\na loan from the Bank, the Bank may charge against such loan, and recover from it, the portion\nof the initial grant that exceeds $250,000 equivalent.", "\t\n7 Appendix 1, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS\nA.\t Phase 1:\t Demand Assessments\n1.\t Outer Islands Demand Assessment\n(i) Examine the Government's development strategies and policies for the major productive\nand supportive sectors, especially agriculture, transport, tourism and fisheries;\n(ii) inventory, map, and analyze the physical features, economic production, trade, land-\nuse, and land development patterns of each major island group in Vanuatu;
