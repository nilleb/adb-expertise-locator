The  Government  of  Myanmar  has  intensified  efforts  to  reform  and  strengthen  the \neducation sector, as reflected in the Framework for Economic and Social Reforms (FESR), \nwhich  identifies  education  as  a  government  priority  critical  to  promoting  inclusive  growth. \nLaunched in October 2012, the Comprehensive Education Sector Review (CESR) marks the \nfirst rigorous and comprehensive assessment of the education sector in 2 decades, and will be \nfundamentally  important  in  more  precisely  pinpointing  sector  challenges  and  providing  a \nstrengthened  evidence  base  for  needed  reforms  and  investments.  Led  by  the  Ministry  of \nEducation  (MOE)\u2014coordinating  inputs  by  agencies  and  development  partners\u2014the  2-year \nCESR has three phases: phase 1, rapid assessment; phase 2, in-depth analysis; and phase 3, \nformulation of a costed education sector plan (CESP).1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB), \ninvolved in the CESR from its initial conceptualization has been the lead development partner \nproviding support for the review and analysis of post-primary education (PPE), which comprises \nthe  secondary  education  subsector (SES),  technical  and  vocational  education  and training \n(TVET), and the higher education subsector (HES). ADB is also providing ongoing capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (CDTA)  in  partnership  with  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID).2 During phase 1, ADB\u2014in collaboration with a team of \ngovernment-seconded  staff  and  experts  mobilized  by  other  development  partners3\u2014has \nsupported completion of high-quality deliverables, including four technical annex reports on SES, \nTVET, HES, and the implications of labor market dynamics for TVET and PPE more broadly. \n \n2.  The government has requested ADB to provide policy and advisory technical assistance \n(TA) to directly support in-depth analysis, policy dialogue, and development of the CESP during \nphases 2 and 3, with a focus on PPE, in coordination with support from other development \npartners (most of which focus on primary, preprimary, and nonformal education). The TA impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates and financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference for initial consultants were agreed at TA fact-finding during 29 April\u2013\n3 May 2013. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Education  sector  development  in  Myanmar  has  been  constrained  by  inadequate \ninvestment and the dearth of consolidated and systematic data, especially for PPE. Available \ndata and analysis suggest that the education sector has been making important progress, \nparticularly  in  primary  education  (grades  1\u20135),  but  faces  persistent  gaps  and  challenges. \nProgress has lagged in PPE, which has received much less development partner support and \nfaces particular challenges in equitable access, education quality and relevance, and subsector \nmanagement (Supplementary Appendix).5 As Myanmar undergoes dramatic and accelerating \nsocioeconomic transformations, PPE must play a critical role in promoting inclusive growth and \n                                                \n1  Based on the design plan endorsed by the President of Myanmar on 4 July 2012.  \n2  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Support for Education Sector \nPlanning.  Manila  (TA  8187-MYA).  AusAID  and  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  lead  overall \ncoordination of development partner support for the CESR. The proposed policy and advisory TA builds on \nfoundational analysis, capacity building, and other prior and ongoing support to the CESR under the CDTA. \n3  Including German development cooperation through GIZ and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (UNESCO). \n4  The ADB Vice-President, Operations 2 approved the TA concept paper on 29 April 2013. The TA first appeared in \nthe business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 May 2013.  \n5  See also ADB. 2012. Initial Assessment of Post-Primary Education in Myanmar. Manila. ADB staff prepared the \nassessment (in dialogue with MOE, other agencies, and development partners) to inform ADB support for the joint \nCESR.     \n ", "2   \npoverty reduction, meeting rapidly evolving labor market needs, and rebalancing and equipping \nthe economy to modernize and utilize technology to access higher value-added sectors and \nsuccessfully enter into global markets as well as the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian \nNations) Economic Community in 2015. Recognizing this, the FESR emphasizes the need to \nimprove PPE access, quality, relevance, and subsector management. \n \n4.  The CESR will thus be vitally important in supporting the government\u2019s development of \nevidence-based, prioritized, and sequenced sector planning, as well as longer-term strategies \nand reforms, including for PPE. It will provide a unified framework for prioritized and sequenced \ninvestments by the government and  development partners, provide a road map for sector \nimprovement, and ensure that increased financing translates into improved sector performance \nand contributions to socioeconomic transformation.6 For PPE, in addition to supporting planning \nfor priority investments, the CESR will provide an evidential basis for delivering on key strategic \nthrusts identified in the FESR, including (i) extending basic education7 from 11 to 12 years and \nrelated curriculum reform, (ii) overhauling TVET to ensure alignment with market demands and \ntrends, and (iii) introducing management reforms and new quality assurance and accreditation \nsystems for higher education. The TA will directly support the CESR, in particular PPE-related \nwork under phases 2 and 3. It will build directly on the foundational analysis and capacity \ndevelopment  under  phase  1  (including  support  under  the  CDTA),  and  strengthen  the \nengagement of multiple stakeholders in policy dialogue. The TA will provide flexible, needs-\ntailored support for in-depth analysis and policy dialogue during phase 2, and formulation of \nviable PPE elements within the broader CESP to be approved at the end of phase 3. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact will be viable and sequenced education planning implemented. The outcome \nwill be PPE plans and priority investments embedded in the new CESP.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) in-depth PPE analysis, (ii) PPE policy and planning \nframeworks, and (iii) identification of high-priority PPE investments. To ensure responsiveness \nto government needs under the joint CESR and development partner harmonization (both of \nwhich are likely to continue to evolve), support under each output will be flexible and developed \nto meet the needs. For instance, while the TA design will specify initial suboutputs (e.g., studies) \nthat directly support phase 2 (expected to be substantively completed by the end of 2013), it will \nallow flexibility to program subsequent suboutputs biannually, or as needed, to meet shifting \nneeds during the CESR process.8 In particular, findings and priorities identified during phase 2 \nwill guide dialogue during phase 3 to formulate the CESP, including identifying priorities for TA-\nsupported  feasibility  analyses  (under  output  3).  Interventions  under  the  three  outputs  will \ndovetail with support from other development partners involved in the CESR.  \n \n                                                \n6  The CESP will include (i) a 2-year plan covering FY2014\u2013FY2015, and (ii) interim planning for education sector \ninvestments during FY2016\u2013FY2020 and input into formulation of the national multisector Sixth Five-Year Plan. \n7  Myanmar defines basic education as comprising 5 years of compulsory primary school, 4 years of middle school, \nand (currently) 2 years of high school; most international definitions end at lower secondary school. \n8  MOE,  ADB,  and  AusAID  will  agree  on  additional  suboutputs.  The  CDTA  (footnote  2)  demonstrated  the \neffectiveness of this approach within the CESR, echoing experiences of similar TA designs in several countries. \n ", "  3 \n7.  Output  1:  In-depth  post-primary  education  analyses  completed.  Building  on \nfoundational analyses under phase 1, the TA will support in-depth assessments under phase 2 \nwith a focus on implications for PPE policy reform, as well as planning and costing analysis to \nsupport phase 3. Three initial suboutputs will produce studies on PPE that will identify priority \nreforms and interventions, including those related to (i) SES curriculum and structural reforms; \n(ii) a policy framework for rationalizing and strengthening TVET systems; and (iii) development \nof a viable, phased, and strategic approach to strengthening higher education institutions in \nMyanmar. Analysis will involve direct collaboration with the CESR team and links with CESR \ninputs provided by other development partners. In addition to the multiple ministries involved in \nPPE, ADB-supported roundtables will engage nongovernment groups, such as private sector \nentities, employer organizations, and civil society organizations, to promote broader stakeholder \ninvolvement in the CESR analysis and policy dialogue. Completed TA-supported studies will be \nconsolidated  into  the  broader  compilation  volume  of  phase  2  studies.  These  and  any \nsubsequently added studies will generally (i) assess access, quality, relevance (including to the \nlabor  market),  and  subsector  management  (including  disaggregation  across  gender, \nsocioeconomic, and geographic dimensions);9 (ii) identify concrete recommendations for policy \naction,  legislation  and  institutional  reforms,  improvements  in  programs  and  operational \nmechanisms, and appropriate innovations;10 and (iii) disseminate (in addition to more detailed \nstudy reports) English and Myanmar-language versions of a self-contained focused synopsis \nmonograph providing a summary focusing on key policy-relevant issues and recommendations.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Post-primary education policy and planning frameworks strengthened. \nThe TA will support MOE and other agencies11 in identifying and formulating improved policies, \ninstitutional reforms, and related legislation to rationalize and strengthen PPE systems and \nsupport strengthened interagency coordination. As with output 1, policy support will give due \nfocus to challenges and responses to ensure equity across gender and other dimensions. Three \ninitial suboutputs will commence at the start of the TA. The first will provide urgent assistance to \nMOE to finalize and operationalize a framework and plan for SES curriculum reform (including \ncontents and pedagogy) to prepare graduates for TVET, HES, and the labor market.12 This will \ninclude support for the development of the new middle and high school curricula, textbooks, and \nteacher guides), ensuring these promote equity across gender and ethnic groups. Two other \ninitial suboutputs will focus on developing (i) a PPE policy note series disseminated to key \nagencies and other stakeholders, which will include legislation and institutional reforms and will \nembed international experience; and (ii) a series of major policy forums\u2014including at least one \neach for TVET and HES, which will draw together multiple ministries and other key stakeholders \ninvolved in PPE. Policy forums will generally be conducted jointly with the development partners \nsupporting these subsectors under the CESR umbrella (para. 13). Looking to phase 3, policy \nand planning support under output 2 will culminate in the inclusion of viable PPE development \nplans in the approved CESP.  \n \n                                                \n9  Analyses will utilize existing administrative and household survey data, as well as focused original data collection. \n10 Among these, the analysis will support a cautious, evidence-based approach to exploring opportunities for low-\ncost, appropriate information and communication technology and other tools, emphasizing their ability (and \nlimitations) to contribute to core education objectives, equity and sustainability, and soft components (e.g., capacity \nbuilding and monitoring and evaluation) alongside minimalist hardware. \n11 Including the Ministry of Science and Technology (the lead agency for TVET in Myanmar), Ministry of Industry, and \nMinistry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. \n12 These reforms aim to improve the quality and relevance of middle and high school curricula to Myanmar\u2019s new \nsocioeconomic context and ensure basic competencies needed in the rapidly evolving labor market. They will add \na grade 12, extending Myanmar\u2019s primary and secondary education cycles to the international norm of 12 years. \nSupport will utilize ADB\u2019s experience in supporting similar SES curriculum reforms in Asia and the Pacific.   \n ", "4   \n9.  Output 3: Preliminary feasibility analyses completed for high-priority post-primary \neducation investments. Based on analytical and policy work under outputs 1\u20132 and priorities \nidentified during phases 1\u20132, output 3 will provide two sets of deliverables. First, the TA will \nsupport the preliminary feasibility analyses of a few high-priority PPE investments slated for \ninclusion in the CESP. The second and core deliverable will be a more detailed design for one \nspecific project suitable for investment by the government, ADB, and/or other development \npartners and that will mainstream equity across gender and other dimensions. ADB\u2019s indicative \nsupport  pipeline  formulated  during  the  26  February\u201315  March  2013  country  programming \nmission  includes  a  2015  PPE  development  project.  Drawing  on  broader  ADB  analyses  of \nMyanmar systems (e.g., related to procurement and financial management), this support will \ninclude  safeguard  aspects  and  broader  project-preparatory  due  diligence  work,  as  well  as \ncapacity development to support smooth start-up of the proposed project. Within PPE, pending \nfurther dialogue to develop a specific project concept, MOE has identified SES reforms as the \ninvestment priority, although the TA will also explore potential inclusion of selective and linked \ninvestments in HES, focusing improving transitions from secondary to higher education. The \nresulting project would include support for introducing a new 7-year SES curriculum (which \noutput 2 will help develop) to improve quality and relevance, with a secondary focus on access \nand subsector management.13  \n \n10.  Risks. The risk of a reversal in Myanmar\u2019s political and socioeconomic policy reforms \nappears small, as does risk of education sector development and the CESR becoming less of a \npriority. The CESR is fully government-owned and embedded in the FESR (para. 1). While \nmulti-stakeholder coordination poses challenges, the education sector is widely recognized as \nthe leading example of development partner harmonization supporting government-led reforms. \nThe  TA  will  involve  close  coordination  and  in  some  cases  direct  collaboration  with  other \ndevelopment partners (particularly those involved in PPE), and continuous dialogue with the \nCESR  office,  development  partners,  and  other  stakeholders  through  existing  coordination \nmechanisms (e.g., the joint education sector working group) as well as working roundtable \nmeetings and larger policy forums. Phase 1 has provided a solid foundation for the TA and \nhelped improve the institutional capacity of MOE and other agencies. The development partners \nwill support capacity development during phases 2 and 3 (including through the CDTA).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA  is  estimated to  cost  $1,800,000  equivalent,  of  which  (i) $1,000,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources); \nand (ii) $500,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia.14 \nThe  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation  and  supplies,  meeting  venues,  administrative  support,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The TA will finance (i) expert inputs (para. 13); (ii) workshops and knowledge \nexchange  activities,  including  costs  related  to  resource  persons,  venue,  equipment  rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, food and nonalcoholic beverages, transportation and lodging, \nlogistics, and administration support; (iii) resource materials, minor computer equipment, and \n                                                \n13 Support for project development will mainstream gender and other equity aspects. The TA will seek linkages to \ndevelopment (under another planned TA) of the expected Myanmar component of a regional TVET project, which \nis included in ADB\u2019s indicative 2013\u20132016 pipeline. \n14 Financing by the Government of Australia will be administered by ADB on a front-loaded basis. This amount \nincludes ADB's administration fee, audit costs, bank charges, and a provision for foreign exchange fluctuations (if \nany), to the extent that these items are not covered by the interest and investment income earned on this grant, or \nany additional grant from the Government of Australia. \n ", "  5 \nother costs related to surveys, field investigations, and data entry; and (iv) other allowable \nexpenditures as agreed by ADB (Appendix 2).   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  MOE will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented from July 2013 to July \n2015.15 To  support  harmonization  and  coordination  across  elements  of  the  CESR  and \ndevelopment  partner  support,  MOE,  through  the  CESR  office,  will  support  day-to-day \nimplementation  and  coordination  across  related  agencies  and  development  partners.16 The \nCESR office, established by MOE in 2012 to coordinate the overall CESR process, comprises \nfull-time  staff  seconded  from  MOE,  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  and  other \nagencies,17 supported  by  two  long-term  international  advisors  and  short-term  consultants \nfunded by other development partners.  \n \n13.  The TA will support 45 person-months of international consultants and 60 person-months \nof national consultants with expertise in PPE. ADB will engage the consultants as individuals in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Terms of reference and key deliverables for six initial consultants supporting phase 2 \nsuboutputs are in Appendix 3.18 The TA will mobilize short-term resource persons to provide \nspecific expertise, as needed. ADB and AusAID staff will be involved in TA implementation, \nincluding in identifying new suboutputs and reviewing draft reports, as well as development \n(early in the TA) of an overall knowledge plan for report dissemination, policy forums and other \nworkshops, and other interventions. TA support will be linked with inputs provided by other \ndevelopment partners supporting PPE elements of the CESR.19 Continuous dialogue will be \nmaintained with a broader array of national and development partner stakeholders through the \nCESR office, existing coordination mechanisms (para. 10), and workshops.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Myanmar for \nSupport for Post-Primary Education Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n15 Within MOE, the Department of the Myanmar Education Research Bureau directly oversees the CESR, in dialogue \nwith the Department of Education Planning and Training, which acts as the focal point for overall coordination \nacross ministries and departments and cooperation with development partners. \n16 Similar proposed implementation arrangements have proven effective under the CDTA (footnote 2). A CESR \nsteering committee supports senior policy dialogue and coordination related to the CESR. \n17 Among these, a total of 12 full-time seconded staff will be involved in HES and TVET analyses, while other CESR \nteam staff will partially focus on the SES under the broader basic education (grades 1\u201311) cluster.   \n18 Pending review, ADB will administer TA-funded procurement and workshop expenses. In all cases, ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time), and other ADB guidelines will be applied. Equipment (indicatively three \nlaptop computers and one printer) will be turned over to MOE after TA completion. \n19 Including German development cooperation through GIZ; the Japan International Cooperation Agency (expected to \nsupport CESR work focused on engineering fields, primary school curriculum reform, and teacher education); and \nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By end of 2017:     Assumptions  \n \nViable and  CESP subplan for 2014\u20132016  MOE reports   No major reversal or \nsequenced  successfully completed   disruption of political, \nSixth Five-Year Plan for \neducation    economic, and social \nNational Development \nplanning  Education sector planning  policy reforms \nand related documents  \nimplemented  under the 2016\u20132021 portion   \nof the CESP incorporated into  Disaggregated national  Continued rapid growth of \nthe Five-Year Plan for National  budget figures  total government \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132021  revenues and \ngovernment prioritization \nof education sector \ndevelopment yield \ncontinued rises in the \neducation budget   \n \nRisk \nBreakdown of \ncoordination mechanisms \nfor CESP implementation \ninvolving multiple \nagencies and \ndevelopment partners \n \nOutcome  By July 2015:    Assumption \nPPE plans and  For each of the three PPE  CESR phase 3  PPE studies and policy \npriority  subsectors, the approved  compilation volume  recommendations \ninvestments  CESP subplan for 2014\u20132016  disseminated by MOE;  endorsed by CESR task \nembedded in  includes prioritized and  consolidated CESR  force and senior officials \nthe new CESP  sequenced investments  progress reports; annual   \n  reports of MOE, Ministry  Follow-on investment \nAmong priority PPE  of Science and  project processed in a \ninvestments identified in the  Technology, and other  timely manner and \napproved CESP, one project  relevant agencies  approved \nfully prepared (with gender   \nmainstreaming) and submitted  Risk \nfor funding consideration by  Breakdown of CESR \nthe government and/or  mechanisms for \nrelevant development  coordination across \npartner(s)   multiple agencies or \n   those for integrating other \nstakeholders into CESR-\nsupported policy dialogue \n \nBreakdown of links \nbetween CESP \npreparation and broader \nnational planning \nprocesses  \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nOutputs   By July 2015:    Assumptions \n \n1.
