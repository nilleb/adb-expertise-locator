INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In May 2014, the Government of Mongolia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto provide capacity development technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare an investment plan for \nscaling up renewable energy. \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132016  for \nMongolia.2 Under the strategy, ADB supports the following energy sector objectives: (i) improve \nenvironmental quality and energy efficiency, (ii) improve energy access and efficiency in urban \ncenters and remote rural areas, (iii) initiate measures to support foreign direct investment in the \nsector, and (iv) build capacity for energy sector planning. During the 29 September\u20133 October \n2014  fact-finding  mission,  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  financial  plan,  implementation \narrangements, and outline of terms of reference for consultants were agreed with the Ministry of \nGeology, Mining and Energy. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mongolia  currently  has  a  total  of  1,062  megawatts  (MW)  of  installed  capacity,  but \nbecause of aging power facilities that are well past their economic life, only 836 MW is available. \nPower supply is unreliable and losses exceed 30%, largely because of the aging transmission \nlines and substation facilities, and poor maintenance. Rapid economic growth has increased \ndemand for electricity and heating. In 2013, the reserve margin for electricity and heat supply \nwas reduced to almost zero. The ADB-assisted energy sector master plan study concludes that \nnew capacity additions of 900 MW in 2020 and 1,020 MW in 2025 are essential to meet the \ngrowing demand by 2025, while maintaining an adequate reserve margin of about 20%.3 \n \n4.  The  development  gap  between  urban  and  rural  areas  is  significant  due  to  uneven \naccess  to  productive  employment  opportunities,  education  and  health  services,  and  basic \ninfrastructure. In 2011, poverty incidence in rural areas is 33.3% compared with 26.6% in urban \nareas. While about 94% of the population has access to either a grid system or stand-alone \nelectricity supply, access to electricity is uneven among regions and households. About 13% of \nthe rural population and 17% of the rural poor do not have access to electricity.4 Access to \nreliable heating service is even worse. About 1,200 coal-fired heat-only boilers with a low \nthermal efficiency of about 40% (compared with a modern combined heat and power plant of \nabout 80% efficiency) are used for heating in aimag (province) and soum (district) centers.5 The \ncondition of boilers and the associated heating pipeline has deteriorated significantly because of \npoor maintenance and aging. \n \n5.  The coal-dependent energy system and the prevailing low energy efficiency is resulting \nin significant air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, especially during heating season, which lasts more \nthan 9 months. During winter, particulate matter (less than 10 micrometers) in Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \natmosphere routinely measures 279 micrograms/cubic meter of air, which is about five times \nhigher than the World Health Organization\u2019s air quality guideline of 50 micrograms/cubic meter.6 \nThe use of low calorie coal and inefficient coal-fired family stoves without proper pollution \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 October 2014. \n2  ADB. 2014.

Mongolia is currently the world\u2019s fifth most carbon-intense economy (2.86 tons of carbon \ndioxide equivalent per $1,000).7 Moving toward a more diversified energy mix with a reduced \nshare of coal is a policy imperative. Renewable energy, most notably wind and solar energy and \nhydropower, is abundantly available. The country\u2019s estimated 3,800 small rivers with a total \nlength of 65,000 kilometers have 6.2 gigawatts of hydropower potential. Solar energy has \nmoderate potential, ranging from 4.5 kilowatts/square meter (m2) in the north to 6.0 kilowatts/m2 \nin the southern Gobi. Wind resources are excellent with 400\u2013600 watts per m2 in 10% of the \ncountry\u2019s land area, with the potential for 1,100 gigawatts of utility-scale wind power (footnote 3). \n \n7.  In 2007, the government enacted the Renewable Energy Law to stimulate renewable \nenergy development. It was accompanied by a set of regulatory arrangements with a feed-in- \ntariff (FIT) for renewable energy to increase its share to 3%\u20135% by 2010 and 20%\u201325% by \n2020. The government has taken several initiatives for renewable energy deployment, most \nnotably, (i) implementing the successful 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification Program (2000\u20132012), \nwhich provided access to modern energy to over half a million nomadic herders through solar \nhome systems; and (ii) facilitating the development of the 50 MW Salkhit wind farm, the first \nprivate power producer. Renewable energy deployment has made steady progress. The current \nshare of renewable energy in total capacity is 7.92% (84.15 MW). \n \n8.  However, increasing the use of renewable energy further is a challenge. Persisting \nfundamental bottlenecks include (i) diminishing reserve margin and lack of regulating capacity in \nthe power system to compensate for fluctuating outputs from intermittent renewable energy \nsuch as wind and solar power; (ii) inadequate balance in the renewable energy fund account to \npay  the  FIT  premium;  (iii)  inadequate  FIT,  which  deters  potential  project  developers  and \ninvestors from setting up new capacity; and (iv) lack of government targeted support to scale up \nstand-alone and mini-grid systems in rural areas, and to switch to renewable energy from coal \nfor heating. \n \n9.  Mongolia is currently on the reserve list of the Scaling Up Renewable Energy in Low-\nIncome Countries Program (SREP), which operates under the Strategic Climate Fund, one of \ntwo  subfunds  of  the  climate  investment  funds  framework.  The  SREP  supports  developing \ncountries  to  expand  energy  access  and  stimulate  economic  growth  through  scaled-up \ndeployment  of  renewable  energy  solutions,  and  provides  a  trigger  for  transforming  the \nrenewables  market  in  each  target country  through  a  programmatic  approach that  involves \ngovernment support for market creation, private sector implementation, and productive energy \nuse. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) implement the SREP in close collaboration with \nother development partners including the United Nations (UN) and bilateral agencies. In March \n2012,  the  SREP  subcommittee  agreed  to  support  the  preparation  of  investment  plans  for \ncountries on the reserve list and to provide up to $300,000 for that purpose for Mongolia. It also \nagreed  upon  the  maximum  amount  of  $30  million  for  Mongolia,  should  additional  funding \nbecome available. \n \n10.  In its endeavor to support renewable energy, the government is keen to utilize the SREP \ninvestment. It expressed its interest in being one of the pilot countries included in the SREP \nreserve list. Participation in the SREP is expected to help the government attain its targeted \n20%\u201325%  renewable  energy  in  the  energy  mix  by  2020.  This  will  help  overcome  current \n                                                \n7  United States Energy Information and Administration. 2012. International Energy Statistics.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n11.  The TA will support the government in (i) comprehensively assessing the country\u2019s \nrenewable energy subsector to identify bottlenecks and recommend urgent policy actions to \novercome these barriers and create an enabling environment for sustained public and private \ninvestments;  (ii)  developing  a  comprehensive  investment  plan  to  meet  20%\u201325%  of  the \nrenewable energy target by 2020; and (iii) enhancing  government capacity in renewable energy \npolicymaking and planning, grid control and protection, and technology and tariff analysis. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be increased renewable energy capacity. The outcome will be increased \nreadiness for investments in renewable energy. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will have two key outputs: \n \n(i)  Renewable energy investment plan for Scaling Up Renewable Energy in \nLow-Income Countries Program funding prepared. The TA will conduct a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  the  country\u2019s  renewable  energy  subsector, \nincluding (a) renewable energy resource potential assessment, (b) levelized cost \nof electricity and heat analysis for potential renewable energy technologies, (c) \ngrid stability assessment for renewable energy evacuation, (d) a policy note with \nrecommended policies and reforms to overcome renewable energy investment \nconstraints, and (e) a renewable energy investment plan that identifies priority \ninvestment projects for SREP funding up to 2020. \n(ii)  Government capacity for renewable energy policy and investment planning \nenhanced. The TA will support capacity development for the executing and \nimplementing  agencies,  and  relevant  government  agencies,  in  investment \nplanning  for  the  country\u2019s  renewable  energy  development,  assessment  of \nrequired amount of the FIT, and grid protection and stability. \n \n14.  The main assumptions are (i) the government will continue to support renewable energy \ndevelopment, and (ii) project developers and investors show strong interest in participating in \ndeveloping priority projects. The main risks of the project are (i) inadequate implementation \ncapacity and lack of priority within the government; and (ii) weak ownership of the investment \nplan by the government, which delays action. During TA preparation, the design was discussed \nextensively with all relevant stakeholders to ensure their buy-in. TA implementation will involve \nall relevant government agencies, MDBs, the UN, bilateral development agencies, civil society, \nand potential private investors in formulating a renewable energy investment plan for SREP \nfunding. \n   \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $360,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the ADB Strategic Climate Fund and administrated by ADB.8 The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of logistics, facilities, remuneration of counterpart staff, \nstudies, report, data, other information and support needed for TA implementation, and other in-\nkind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  20  December  2014  to  19  January  2016.  The \nconsultants will submit the following report in English and Mongolian: (i) report on country and \nenergy  sector  overview  within  8  weeks  after  TA  commencement;  (ii)  renewable  energy \ntechnology  assessment  and  policy  recommendation  note  within  20  weeks  after  TA \ncommencement;  (iii)  priority  renewable  energy  projects  report  within  28  weeks  after  TA \ncommencement; (iv) draft renewable energy investment plan for the SREP within 32 weeks \nafter TA commencement; and (v) final renewable energy investment plan for the SREP within 2 \nmonths after receipt of comments from MDBs, including ADB and the government. Consultation \nmeetings will be organized for inception, interim, and draft final outputs inviting all officials \nconcerned from the government, private sector, nongovernment organizations, the UN, and \nbilateral development agencies to disseminate findings and receive comments. \n \n17.  The Ministry of Geology, Mining and Energy is the executing agency for the TA, 9 and \nthe National Renewable Energy Center is the implementing agency.10 ADB\u2019s Energy Division, \nEast  Asia  Department,  and  the  Climate  Investment  Fund  Team  in  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nInfrastructure Division, Regional and Sustainable Development Department, with the assistance \nof the Mongolia Resident Mission, jointly lead the MDB group to guide and administer TA \nimplementation under the executing and implementing agencies. 11  \n \n18.  The TA will require international (5 person-months) and national (13 person-months) \nconsulting services. International experts include (i) senior renewable energy sector specialist \nand team leader, and (ii) renewable energy economist. National experts include (i) renewable \nenergy sector specialist and deputy team leader, and (ii) renewable energy economist. ADB will \nengage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time) using individual consultant selection because only four experts are \nrequired; and renewable energy in Mongolia is a nascent industry and very few national or \ninternational experts have prior experience in Mongolia, which is crucial to prepare a realistic \nrenewable energy investment plan, including the necessary policy reform recommendations. \n \n19.  The TA consultants will procure equipment following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB's \n                                                \n8  Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries financed by the Strategic Climate \nFund. \n9  The Ministry of Geology, Mining and Energy will be responsible for TA implementation and for counterpart support \nneeded for implementation, and will administer the fund under advance payment facilities. \n10 The National Renewable Energy Center is responsible for supervising day-to-day TA activities. It was established \nin 2006 for (i) research and study of renewable energy technologies, (ii) assessment of renewable energy \nresources, (iii) development of national technical standards and quality control for renewable energy systems, and \n(iv) implementation of the national renewable energy program.

Tasks \n1.  Task 1: Prepare country and energy sector overview. Under this task the consultant \nwill undertake the following: \n(i)  Prepare  a  background  note  describing  the  country  context,  including  main \ndemographic, social, and economic indicators as of the most recent date. \n(ii)  Prepare an overview of the energy sector, including (a) basic energy balance (for \nat least 2008\u20132013); (b) description of the sector structure; (c) legislation and \nregulatory  framework  and  government  strategy;  (d)  electricity  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution assets; (e) electricity generation mix; (f) tariffs and \ntariff structures; (g) key entities involved in sector regulation; and (h) key sector \nchallenges. \n(iii)  Assess the larger loads (e.g., mines) along with location and potential timing, \nwhile putting the analysis together. Include the ability of the private sector to \nservice the loads through a third party entity and on a captive basis. \n(iv)  Prepare an overview of the estimated potential for various renewable energy \ntechnologies and renewable energy penetration targets as well as a review of \nongoing  and  planned  renewable  energy  activities  and  projects  in  Mongolia. \nInclude  expected country-specific environmental and social opportunities and \nrisks associated with developing the considered renewable energy technologies. \n(v)  Summarize the key barriers (technical, regulatory, and financial) for the public \nand  private  sectors  that  hinder  the  development  of  renewable  energy \ntechnologies and propose measures to overcome them. Consider the experience \nof the Salkhit wind farm as the only significant provider of renewable energy to \ndate.  Provide  a  detailed  description  of  the  availability  of  private  (firms  and \nfinancial institutions) and/or other government financing for renewable energy \nprojects, including terms of financing, and discuss the bottlenecks to developing \nrenewable energy associated with availability and terms of financing. \n \n2.  Task 2: Assess various renewable energy technologies applicable in Mongolia \nand  propose  measures  to  overcome  the  barriers  hindering  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.
