INTRODUCTION \n1.  Timely  and  reliable  sex-disaggregated  data  on  education,  health  and  demography \n(through civil registration and vital statistics [CRVS] systems), employment, and on emerging \nareas of asset ownership and entrepreneurship are needed to monitor progress in achieving \ninclusive  growth  (through  socially  inclusive  policies  and  equality  of  opportunity)  and \ndevelopment goals such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Coordinated initiatives \nby development partners have sought to build country capacity to collect such data. A new \nglobal initiative on gender statistics\u2014Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE)\u2014is led by \nthe United Nations (UN) Statistics Division and the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women in collaboration with other development partners, and seeks to make \navailable gender indicators on health, education, employment, entrepreneurship, and  asset \nownership.1  The Statistics Division of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe  Pacific  (ESCAP)  is  leading  an  initiative  to  develop  a  regional  strategic  program  for \nimprovement of CRVS systems in collaboration with development partners such as the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), Health Metrics Network, Plan International, Secretariat of the Pacific \nCommunity, UN Population Fund, UN Children\u2019s Fund, World Health Organization, and others.  \n2.  ADB  has  been  collaborating  with  development  partners  in  supporting  capacity \ndevelopment in Asia and the Pacific in the above areas. In planning this technical assistance \n(TA),2 partner agencies and statisticians from national statistical offices in Cambodia, Georgia, \nand the Philippines were consulted. This TA is designed to strengthen the capacity of selected \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  producing  gender  statistics  and  improving  CRVS \nsystems. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness recognized the critical need for a global \naction plan to enhance statistics capacity.3 It specifically highlighted the role of gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment in achieving development results and the need to accelerate and \ndeepen efforts to collect, disseminate, harmonize, and make full use of gender statistics to \ninform policy decisions. In 1995, the UN Beijing Platform for Action provided recommendations \nto regularly collect sex-disaggregated statistics, but major gaps in the availability and quality of \ngender statistics remain in many areas.4 There are standard definitions and methods of data \ncollection  in  the  areas  of  education,  health  and  employment,  but  no  clear  standards  and \ncommonly accepted definitions to guide data collection on entrepreneurship and ownership of \nassets  and  their  gender  dimensions.  Data  collected  through  country  surveys  may  not  be \ncomparable because of a lack of commonly accepted definitions.5 There is a need for common \n                                                \n1  The 3-year EDGE project receives funding from various development partners and will be implemented in \npartnership with UN regional commissions and development banks. It also addresses part of the Busan Joint \nAction Plan on Gender Equality and Development and builds on the work of the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group \non Gender Statistics to define a harmonized list of gender equality indicators based on the recommendations of the \nUN Statistical Commission, to serve as the basic framework for compiling statistics on women and men.  \n2   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section website on 24 October 2012. \n3   Para 18 c) of the Busan partnership document (available at www.busanhlf4.org) refers to partners\u2019 commitment to \nA Busan Action Plan for Statistics (BAPS) (http://www.paris21.org/busan-action-plan) that sets out the renewed \npartnership to improve statistics in support of development effectiveness and results, and identifies emerging \nstatistical programs, priorities and actions. Mainstreaming gender statistics and addressing weaknesses in the \nCRVS systems are included under the plan\u2019s action 1 and are included among emerging priorities and programs. \n4   http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf \n5  See, for instance, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. 2010. Developing Gender Statistics: A \nPractical Tool. Geneva. \n ", "2 \n \nstandards for the collection of comparable data, and to understand problems faced by women \nentrepreneurs  and  their  roles  as  contributors  to  employment,  productivity,  innovation,  and \neconomic growth. Surveys often collect household-level data on assets (real and financial), but \nunderstanding its gender dimensions requires additional information (e.g., whether assets are \nowned individually or jointly, how assets were acquired, the value and use of assets, who \nmakes decisions regarding their economic use, and who derives income from assets).  \n \n4.  The global  EDGE  project  aims  to (i)  develop  standard methods  and definitions for \ncollecting sex-disaggregated data on entrepreneurship and ownership of assets, (ii) conduct \npilot surveys for data collection in selected countries, and (iii) present standards to the UN \nStatistical Commission. The EDGE project will use a practical, cost-effective and sustainable \ndata collection method, and make use of existing surveys (such as household surveys on living \nstandards, income and expenditure; labor force surveys; and enterprise surveys) by including \nadditional questions to elicit sex-disaggregated information.  \n \n5.  CRVS systems are  the most comprehensive source of sex-disaggregated data on vital \nevents at national and sub-national levels that can provide timely indicators of fertility, mortality \n(including maternal and child mortality for MDGs 4 and 5), and cause of death, which are very \ncritical for social policy formulation and MDG monitoring. However, recent assessments6 show \nthat these systems are suffering from incomplete registration and poor quality of vital statistics, \nleading to the use of costly donor-funded (and therefore unsustainable) household surveys. TA 7 \nprovided by ADB to support achievement of the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific indicated the \nneed to develop reliable alternative sources of data for monitoring MDG progress, in particular, \nMDGs 4 and 5, while ADB TA8 on improving data sources for MDG monitoring  assessed \nweaknesses in the CRVS systems. The poor functioning of CRVS systems commonly stems \nfrom lack of awareness and political commitment, limited human and financial capacity, lack of \nincentive to register, barriers to registration (e.g., costs, distance from registration centers, and \ncultural norms), absence of adequate legal provisions, and lack of appreciation for timely and \nreliable statistics. Most countries lack good quality cause-of-death statistics, which is a serious \nimpediment  to  a gender-based  approach  to  health  policy.  The  absence  of  well-functioning \nCRVS  systems  also  deprives  citizens  of  basic  legal  documents  such  as  birth,  death,  and \nmarriage certificates, thereby denying basic rights and governance benefits to much of the \npopulation, especially the poor and marginalized people.  \n \n6.  Improving CRVS systems requires a coordinated, long-term approach involving multiple \nstakeholders at the country and regional levels. Initial steps are now being taken by African \nstates to improve their CRVS systems. This is reflected in the Africa Programme on Accelerated \nImprovement  of  Civil  Registration  and  Vital  Statistics.  In  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  ESCAP,  in \ncoordination with development partners and member countries, has begun work on a regional \nstrategic program for improvement of CRVS systems, and countries are being encouraged to \nundertake comprehensive assessments of their CRVS systems and develop prioritized strategic \naction plans. Initial regional activities (organizing a regional forum of experts, training programs, \nand country assessments organized by ESCAP) were supported under the ADB TA (footnote 7).  \n                                                \n6  As of September 2012, an ESCAP rapid assessment of the CRVS systems of 35 countries in Asia and the Pacific \nindicates 13 countries have weak or dysfunctional systems, 11 have systems that are functional but inadequate in \nmany respects, while 11 have satisfactory systems that register more than 90% of births and deaths, but for which \nfurther improvements (e.g., in data quality and cause of death reporting) would be desirable.  \n7   ADB. 2007.

The impact of the TA will be improvement in the capacity of participating DMCs to \nproduce  reliable  sex-disaggregated  statistics  on  ownership  of  assets  and  entrepreneurship \nusing standard methods, and improvement in vital statistics from CRVS systems. The outcome \nof the TA will be improved methods to collect sex-disaggregated data on entrepreneurship and \nasset ownership, and improved CRVS systems in prioritized areas.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  To achieve the outcomes, the TA\u2019s components will focus on (i) sex-disaggregated data \non asset ownership and entrepreneurship, and (ii) improving CRVS systems.  \n \n9.  Component  1:  Sex-disaggregated  data  on  assets  and  entrepreneurship.  This \ncomponent will be implemented in close collaboration with development partners in the global \nEDGE initiative. The main outputs are (i) development of standard methods for collection of \ncomparable  data  on  entrepreneurship  and  asset  ownership  by  gender,  and  preparation  of \ntechnical reports and inputs relating to global standards; (ii) training of DMC staff on new \nmethods  of  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  on  entrepreneurship and  asset  ownership \nthrough regional and in-country trainings and workshops; and (iii) conduct of pilot data collection \n(surveys) in three selected DMCs using standard data collection methods for entrepreneurship \nand asset ownership. Limited funds and technical advice will be provided to participating DMCs \nto cover the cost of data collection for additional questions to be canvassed in the pilot surveys, \ndata processing, data analysis, data review and validation, and preparation of country reports.  \n \n10.  Based on preliminary discussions, Georgia, Mongolia, and the Philippines have been \ntentatively identified by ADB to participate in component 1 and to undertake the pilot surveys. \nThe national statistics offices in each country will be the main counterpart government agency. \nThe participation of countries will be determined (i) by their willingness to be involved in and \ncommit to the project, (ii) through a review of the surveys they have planned during the project \nperiod,9 and (iii) through a review of existing survey questionnaires and their suitability for pilot \nsurveys. Review process may include other countries if any of those in the tentative list could \nnot meet all the criteria. The final selection of three DMCs will be made in consultation with the \nEDGE project to ensure a reasonable representation of countries from Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n11.  Component 2: Improvements in civil registration and vital statistics. The CRVS \ncomponent will be implemented in collaboration with ESCAP and other development partners \nsupporting the regional strategic plan for improvement of CRVS systems in Asia and the Pacific. \nThe  key  outputs  are  (i)  contribution  to  the  development  of  a  regional  strategic  plan  for \nimprovement  of  CRVS  systems  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  which  is  a  collaborative  regional \ninitiative  undertaken  by  development  partners  and  countries\u2014to  be  collaborated  with  UN \nESCAP to provide technical support and joint organization of workshops and conferences for \nadvocacy and capacity building; (ii) approved country proposals for improving CRVS systems \nimplemented for the three participating DMCs, which will be achieved by providing financial and \ntechnical support to selected DMCs to implement improvements in their CRVS systems in line \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nwith the regional strategic plan and identified country priorities based on a comprehensive \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n9 Candidate surveys are household surveys on living standards, income and expenditures; labor force surveys; and \nenterprise surveys. \n ", "4 \n \nassessment  of  CRVS  systems;10 and  (iii)  design  or  implementation  of  associated  training \nprograms for improvement of CRVS systems in participating DMCs. DMC proposals will be \nreviewed  in  consultation  with  the  development  partners  supporting  CRVS  systems  at  the \ncountry level (such as the World Health Organization). The TA will also support collaboration \nwith other developing regions and regional development banks to promote cooperation between \ndeveloping countries and sharing of lessons and good practices. A consolidated report on the \nCRVS component will be prepared and widely distributed.  \n \n12.  Three DMCs will participate under the CRVS component. Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and \nTimor-Leste have been tentatively identified based on comprehensive assessments of their \nCRVS systems and priority-setting for improving CRVS systems. The final selection will be \nguided by willingness of countries to participate and commit to the project, a review of country \nproposals based on comprehensive CRVS assessment reports and identified priorities, and \nconsultations with other development partners. The counterpart agency, which will act as the \nfocal agency in each DMC, could be each country\u2019s national statistics office, civil registrar\u2019s \noffice, or ministry of health. \n \n13.  The success of the TA will require good coordination among development partners and \nownership and commitment by participating DMCs in implementing project activities.  Multi-\nsector coordination is particularly important for the CRVS systems. The availability of qualified \nexperts and consultants to provide technical support is assumed; risks include a lack of capable \ncounterpart support from participating DMCs, staff turnover, and changes in the country teams.  \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The costs will cover consultancy services \nfor methodological work and technical advice to the countries, financial support to implement \ncountry-level  activities  such  as  surveys  and  data  collection,  CRVS  systems  development, \ntraining  and  workshops,  publications,  dissemination,  regional-level  events,  and  cooperation \nbetween developing countries. No activities will be undertaken in any participating DMC until the \nrequisite no-objection has been obtained from the DMC. The detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be administered by the ADB Economics \nand Research Department. Both components will be implemented over 36 months (December \n2012\u2013November  2015)  in  collaboration  with  participating  DMCs. 11  Collaboration  with \ndevelopment  partners  will  align  activities  with  the  global  and  regional  initiatives,  avoid \nduplication of effort, and leverage development partner strengths. Partnership agreements will \nbe made to coordinate technical activities during TA implementation. ADB will be represented in \nthe steering committee and the technical working group of the global EDGE initiative, and in the \n                                                \n10 Under the regional initiative, some countries have conducted comprehensive assessments of their CRVS systems, \nwhile assessments are in progress in others. The TA could support (i) development of strategic action plans \nincluding cost estimates to establish functional CRVS systems; (ii) improving coordination mechanisms for CRVS; \n(iii) improving registration  and sex-disaggregated statistics relating to births, deaths, and causes of death; (iv) \nimproving methods of obtaining data on non-institutional deaths, developing innovative methods for registration \nmanagement, and processing and compilation of vital statistics; and (v) development of staff capacity. \n11  This will coincide with the global EDGE project, which is slated to close by December 2015. \n ", "5 \n \nregional committees for drafting the regional strategic plan for coordination of CRVS activities in \nAsia and the Pacific.  \n \n16.  A memorandum of agreement with a comprehensive schedule of activities will be signed \nwith  each  participating  DMC  to  implement  pilot  surveys  under  component  1,  or  CRVS \nimprovement activities for DMCs participating in component 2. The agreements will specify an \nappropriate financial management facility. Funds for country-level activities will be disbursed in \naccordance  with  the  procedures  of  ADB's  advance  payment  facility.  The  financial  support \nprovided to individual DMC\u2019s will vary depending on the sample size and work associated with \ncanvassing additional questions (component 1); and on country-specific prioritized activities for \nCRVS improvements (component 2).  \n \n17.   The TA will be implemented by international, national, and administrative staff from \nADB\u2019s Development Indicators and Policy Research Division with support from international and \nnational consultants. The division will collaborate with development partners engaged in the \nglobal EDGE initiative and regional CRVS initiatives, ADB regional departments12  engaged in \nrelated activities, and the Regional and Sustainable Development Department. Component 1 \nwill require an estimated 5 person-months of international and 15 person-months of national \nconsultant inputs (average of 5 national person-months per DMC). Component 2 will require 3 \nperson-months of international and 12 person-months of national consultant inputs (average of \n4 national person-months per DMC). The national consultant inputs may vary depending upon \ncountry  needs. The remaining  27  person-months  of  national  consultant  inputs  will  support \nproject  management,  research,  website  management,  and  data  processing  at  ADB \nheadquarters. Collaborations with development partners and specialized institutions (e.g., the \nStatistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific and the University of Queensland Health Information \nSystem Knowledge Hub) will be established in the course of TA implementation and individual \nresource  persons  will  be  engaged  from  them  to  source  expertise  for  training,  facilitating \nworkshops, and providing need-based technical support. Assignment per resource person will \nnot exceed 10 working days.  \n \n18.   The outline and specific terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The \nconsultants will be hired as individuals and will be engaged directly by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Individual \nconsultants are preferred over a firm in consideration of the limited and specialized technical \nservices  required  for  implementing  the  TA  components.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime  to time). The  procurement  of  any  equipment  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Proper turnover of equipment to \nthe participating DMCs will be ensured upon project completion. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,100,000 on a grant basis \nfor Statistical Capacity Development for Social Inclusion and Gender Equality, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.   \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n12  For example, with statistics capacity building activities of the Pacific Department and the Central and West Asia \nDepartment. \n ", "6       Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved capacity of the  Participating DMCs produce  Data reports of  Countries are willing \nparticipating DMCs to  reliable and accurate  countries available on  and committed to \nproduce reliable sex- statistics on identified focus  website and in print.   long-term \ndisaggregated statistics  areas on a regular basis.    improvements in \non ownership of assets    gender statistics and \nand entrepreneurship  Increased availability of  Government planning  CRVS systems. \nusing standard methods,  sex-disaggregated data on  and policy documents \nRisk \nand improved vital  assets and  based on available \nstatistics from CRVS  entrepreneurship and on  data.
