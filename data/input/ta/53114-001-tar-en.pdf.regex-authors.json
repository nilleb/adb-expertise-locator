The transaction technical assistance facility (TA facility) will support project preparation to \nensuing urban development and water investment projects, comprising Livable Cities Investment \nProgram  and Water  Supply  and  Sanitation (WSS)  Service Improvement  Project,  Phase  2, \nincluded in the country operations business plan 2019\u20132021 for Georgia.1 The TA facility will \nenable Asian Development Bank (ADB) to be responsive in addressing the country\u2019s dynamic \nand evolving needs and its desire to apply integrated urban solutions for livable cities. The TA \nfacility will also cover technical assistance (TA) needs for the ongoing projects that are difficult to \nbe accommodated under the existing financing arrangement.2 The list of ADB-financed urban \ndevelopment projects in Georgia is in Appendix 3. \n \n2.  Strategic  linkages.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is  harmonized  with  the  strategic  regional \ndevelopment priorities of the government of Georgia (the government).3 The ensuing projects aim \nto incorporate the key reform areas outlined in its national development strategy of Georgia,4 and \nsupport all seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.5 They will also contribute to the \nSustainable Development Goals.  \n \n3.  The TA facility will prepare integrated urban solutions and programmatic investment \nprogram for Georgia with a series of cross-cutting multisectoral, multi-region interventions for \nimproved livable cities in Georgia (impact)\u2014economically competitive, socially inclusive, and \nenvironmentally resilient. The ensuing projects will contribute to improved urban infrastructure \nand services in selected areas of Georgia (outcome). In addition, support for governance and \ninstitutional capacity will underpin all ADB-financed activities to ensure results and sustainability. \nFurther, ADB will help to increase prospect, and more effectively engage private sector knowledge \nand expertise, technologies, and innovation to improve access, efficiency, and quality of urban \nservices. \n \n4.  Rationale for TA facility. ADB has a strong urban development and water sector pipeline \nin Georgia. The TA facility will allow adequate time and resources to conduct thorough scoping, \nfieldwork,  participatory  planning,  and  stakeholder  consultation.  It  provides  flexibility  to \naccommodate a comprehensive scope of services, to be responsive and tailored to the remaining \nand  emerging  development  needs.  Moreover,  it  is  cost-efficient  and  can  effectively  avoid \nduplication of work. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Georgia Country Operations Business Plan, 2019\u20132021. Manila. The proposed technical assistance \nfacility (TA facility) will be reflected in the next rolling country operations business plan. \n2   Sustainable Urban Transport Investment Program ($300 million) and Urban Services Improvement Investment \nProgram ($500 million) will close in July 2020 and March 2021, respectively. They consist of 11 active projects. \nImplementation and capacity development support for active and/or completed projects will be included such as \nsafeguards assessment and monitoring, that are difficult to be accommodated under the existing financing \narrangement because of constrained time, cost, and scope of services. \n3  Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure of Georgia. 2018.

Tbilisi. \nThe  government  aims  to  achieve  inclusive  economic  growth  by  developing  infrastructure,  innovation  and \ntechnologies, human resources, and private sector participation. \n5  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n \n ", "2   \n5.  Integrated solutions for livable cities. Georgia is strategically located at the crossroads \nof Europe and Asia, rich in natural resources and cultural heritage. Despite these comparative \nadvantages, substantial infrastructure and capacity gaps remain to realize its economic potential. \nBesides, its mountainous terrain and regions have placed more barriers on the provision of basic \ninfrastructure, access to essential urban services, and economic growth opportunities.6   \n \n6.  To drive growth, the government will continue to (i) build its transit potential to promote \ninternational trade and commerce,7 and (ii) prioritize the provision of urban basic services where \nlarger populations have increased demand and there are greater pressures on accessible, quality \nservice delivery. Still, the prevalent\u2014large and growing\u2014disparities in regional development and \nuneven access to basic services will crimp inclusive and sustainable growth and underlie key \ndevelopment challenges of the government.  \n \n7.  Since November 2016, the government has mainstreamed participatory planning and \nvisioning to map out upstream integrated urban action plans and investment programming.8 For \ninclusive economic growth and balanced regional development, strategic planning of select urban \narea  clusters  are  strengthened.  Building  on  this,  the government  has  (i)  prioritized  crucial \nmultisectoral,  multi-region  urban  investments, 9  and  (ii)  provisioned  resources  to  prepare \nintegrated urban development solutions.10 ADB will support the government (i) capitalize on \nongoing investments in connectivity and accessibility, and (ii) develop economic corridors and \nclusters as hubs for tourism, agribusiness, small and medium enterprises, and logistics.11 Basic \nurban services and transport will be prioritized, particularly in small towns and regional cities that \nare potential hubs for tourism and agribusiness as key drivers of economic growth. It is envisaged \nthat additional income and jobs\u2013especially for women, the youth, and the poor\u2013would result in \nstimulating  local  growth,  economic  diversification  and  balance  between  urban  and  rural \ndevelopment.  \n \n8.  Water supply and sanitation. WSS has a high potential impact on poverty reduction, \ngender equality, social inclusion, and environment. Well-governed WSS sector has an extensive \ngeneral impact on the economy and contributes to productive economic activity of women. \nGeorgia has made great strides in restoring WSS infrastructure and meeting the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.12 Albeit, Georgia has (i) 73% of population using safely managed drinking \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2016. Realizing the Urban Potential in Georgia: National Urban Assessment. Manila. Income inequality in \nGeorgia is one of the highest in the Central Asia region. In Georgia, about half of the population lives in rural areas. \nOut of 3.7 million population, estimated 0.8 million people (22%) are living below the national poverty line (2017) and \n0.3 million (8%) of these are extremely poor. About 4% of population has below $1.90 purchasing power parity a day. \nWomen account for a significant proportion of the poorest. \n7  Georgia is the latest member of Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC). \n8  ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Livable Urban Areas: Integrated Urban Plans for Balanced Regional \nDevelopment. Manila (policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) 9220). \n9  This includes, among others, water supply, sewerage and sanitation (including off-network solutions), urban transport \nand mobility (including nonmotorized and public transport), solid waste management, economic corridors, cultural \nand historical heritage conservation, flood control and drainage, urban safety and resilience. \n10 Project Readiness Financing is under preparation for the Livable Cities Investment Program to support detailed \nengineering designs to ensure design and procurement ready projects. \n11 It will also contribute to regional cooperation and CAREC 2030 by supporting regional transport and mobility plan, \nimproving regional connectivity via public and cargo transport and airport, as well as inter-municipal and regional \nconnectivity via public transport. \n12  World Health Organization\u2013United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). 2017. Joint Monitoring Program. Washington, \nDC. In 2015, Georgia has reached universal access to improved water source and 86% access to improved sanitation \n(95% in urban and 76% in rural areas) with about 98% of urban population having access to piped water supply and \n77% to piped sewerage connection. \n \n ", "3 \nwater services, and (ii) 17% using safely managed sanitation services, based on the Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goals  indicators  (2015).13 Estimated  64%  customers  experience  intermittent \nservice.14 Inadequate wastewater treatment and solid waste management are threatening public \nhealth and environment. The problem gets more acute outside of the urban centers. Still, there \nare huge financing needs for WSS infrastructure, for some lagging regions have only 34% of \nhouseholds with water supply systems and lack access to basic sanitation.  \n \n9.  Continued investment in WSS infrastructure is critical to address limited, unequal access \nto WSS services, and nonperforming assets. Low service level and tariff, high waste and losses, \nand  reactive  and  ineffective  maintenance  are prevailing  in WSS  operations. The  declining \nmanagement efficiency and labor productivity have nonrevenue water hovering over 60% across \nGeorgia.15 The government\u2019s recent investments in infrastructure risk suboptimal performance \nand accelerated physical deterioration, with weak institutional, technical, and financial capacity.  \n \n10.  Safe and reliable WSS services remain a key development priority of the government. \nADB will continue to add value by fostering a sustainable operational model for WSS as well as \naccelerating progress in skills and capacity development, innovation, technologies, and private \nsector participation for stronger and sustained results and greater efficiency. ADB will further help \nto address key challenges in policy and regulatory environment that constrain inclusive growth \nand development. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n11.

Basic 2018 Statistics. Manila.  \n14 The United Water Supply Company of Georgia (UWSCG) services about 0.8 million population in 57 cities and towns. \nOnly 25% of UWSCG service centers provide 24-hour coverage. Among those with access to piped water, about \n50% have supply for only 3\u20134 days per week and mostly for only 2\u20134 hours per day. About 23% residents lack piped \nsewer connections and rely on other onsite sanitation systems, including pit latrines and septic tanks. Women are \nmost affected from the unavailability or poor quality of the WSS system since they are managing and distributing \nwater in the households. \n15 Lack of bulk and distribution metering makes accurate nonrevenue water estimation difficult. \n16 Master bidding documents will be prepared for new executing and implementing agencies under ensuing projects.  \n \n ", "4   \npublic consultation and communication strategy. This may include geospatial analysis, earth \nobservation and diagnostic studies, among others.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Project management and urban service delivery capacity strengthened. \nThe TA facility will cover technical and policy advice, reforms, governance, capacity development, \nand  knowledge  work  to  support  ensuing  and  ongoing  projects. 17  Activities  include:  (i) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity in operation and maintenance and cost \nrecovery mechanisms, (ii) developing policy, strategy, regulation, and reform measures, and (iii) \nimproving project implementation and contract management capacity. The government\u2019s human \ndevelopment initiative will be supported via sharing knowledge and best practices, building \ncapacities\u2014in  skills, gender-sensitive  professional  and  workforce  development,  and  human \nresources  management\u2014and  increasing  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation  and \ninvestment. The TA facility will support knowledge management through gender-inclusive training, \npublications, and other cost-effective forms of knowledge sharing. \n \n14.  Output 3: Compliance and contractual disputes reduced. The TA facility will help to (i) \npreempt and/or resolve safeguards and contractual issues, and (ii) minimize potential contractual \ndisputes. Executing and implementing agencies will be supported to ensure compliance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement and facilitate resolution of project-related complaints as well as the \ndevelopment and implementation of remedial actions in projects affected by compliance review. \nIt will assist the government in preparing and managing performance-based contracts, and \nimplementing a range of measures to monitor, manage, and counter risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $2.60 million, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1. Additional resources will be sought during TA facility implementation for \nprefeasibility,  feasibility,  and  other  complementary  activities.  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, \ninformation and documents relevant for the preparation of the ensuing projects, and other in-kind \ncontributions, equivalent to $260,000.  \n \n16.
