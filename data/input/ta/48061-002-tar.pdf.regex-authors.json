INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) was requested by the Government of Mongolia \nduring the country programming mission in February 2014 and through a letter from the Ministry \nof  Economic  Development  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  dated  4  April  2014.1 A \nreconnaissance mission was conducted 10\u201314 March 2014 that held discussions with officials \nof the Ministry of Environment and Green Development (MEGD), the Embassy of Japan, the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, German development cooperation (GIZ), and other \nstakeholders.2 This was followed up with a consultation mission on 2\u20134 June 2014 that held \nconsultations with local forest user groups (FUGs). A fact-finding mission was conducted 10\u201312 \nSeptember 2014 for further discussions with MEGD and other stakeholders.3 The government \nhas  concurred  with  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia is one of the world\u2019s coldest countries. In the Daurian forest steppe ecoregion \nin northeastern Mongolia, night temperatures drop to \u201340\u00b0 Celsius, and families heat their \nhouses over 250 days per year. Mongolia has about 10.8 million hectares (ha) of forest cover, \nwith approximately 60,000 ha of loss per year, driven mostly by logging and fires. The forest has \na natural monoculture of larch, birch, and poplar. The project area is in Mongolia\u2019s northeastern \nregion, where most of the remaining forest cover is located.4 \n \n3.  The  livelihood  opportunities  for  local  communities  are  limited  by  the  short  growing \nseason and low yields for agricultural products.5 Rural communities are highly dependent on \nagricultural products and pastoralism. Those communities consist mostly of herders with little \naccess to non-herding income. Poverty in those areas is generally high\u2014for 2012, according to \nWorld Bank assessments, more than 35% of the rural population was considered poor following \nnational standards.6 In the project area, annual household income is as low as MNT1,000,000, \nand  average  annual  household  income  is  between  MNT2,200,000  and  MNT3,500,000, \ndepending on location. \n \n4.  Mongolia is already seeing impacts of climate change, with average mean temperature \nincreases of over 2\u00b0 Celsius and annual precipitation of about 220 millimeters in the North.7 The \nmain climate change impact is decreasing forest cover, mostly due to natural forest fires. \nProjected temperature increases raise risks of forest fires. Forests are key for sequestering \ncarbon, maintaining soil stability, and providing habitat for a variety of endemic biodiversity. \n \n5.  The forest currently contains large amounts of deadwood, including deadfalls, debris, \nand slash. Such high fuel loads further increase fire risks and may lead to devastating fires. \nMEGD estimates that, nationwide, about 16 million cubic meters of deadwood need to be \ncleared from the forest to reduce fuel loads, at a sustainable annual extraction rate of about 1.3 \n                                                \n1  Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Finance were merged in December 2014. \n2  MEGD was restructured and renamed as Ministry of Environment and Tourism. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 October 2014. \n4  Statistics Division, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates, 2011. \n5  The growing season is only 4\u20135 months per year. \n6  World Bank Group in Mongolia. 2013. 2013: Mongolia Economic Update.

Moreover,  communities  can  use  deadwood  as  a  livelihood \nsource\u2014as raw material for furniture production or an alternative fuel to decrease coal use. The \nforest line agencies are \u201ctop-heavy,\u201d with more attention paid to managerial positions, while \nlacking technical staff to sustainably manage the forest areas and risks to the forest areas. \nAlmost a third of forest ranger positions are unfilled. \n \n6.  The 2006 Forest By-Laws, enacted in 2009, allow local communities to form community-\nbased FUGs to manage forest areas based on forest management plans approved by regional \ngovernments.  To  date,  1,180  FUGs  with  about  26,000  members  have  been  established, \nmanaging  over  3  million  ha  of  forest.  Less  than  50%  of  FUGs  have  prepared  forest \nmanagement plans, and less than 25% have prepared forest inventories. Most FUGs lack (i) \nknowledge to establish forest inventories and management plans, (ii) knowledge on efficiently \ncleaning  deadwood  and  sustainably  maintaining  the  forest,  (iii)  access  to  technology  and \ntechnical skills to use forest-extracted wood, and (iv) business skills and marketing knowledge \nto derive livelihoods from forest-extracted wood. FUGs have been successful in sustainable \nforest management (SFM) in tropical and subtropical countries, but these efforts have not yet \nbeen transplanted to Mongolia. The TA will support local communities, organized into about 100 \nFUGs. Other local stakeholders will include forest units under MEGD and forest enterprises. \n \n7.  Government  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy.  The  TA  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s forest policies, particularly MEGD\u2019s Forest Cleaning Program, and strengthen \ngovernment  initiatives  to  develop  FUG  and  private  enterprise  engagement  in  forest \nmanagement. It will support one of six National Development Strategy (NDS) priorities: halting \nimbalances  in  the  ecosystem  and  implementing  protective  measures.8 The  NDS  contains \nenvironment-related  directions  for  2007\u20132021  to  alleviate  ecosystem  and  environmental \ndegradation and pollution through conservation and sustainable use of forest reserves. The TA \nwill support low-income households in rural areas by building capacity, supporting business \ncreation,  and  creating  employment,  thereby  contributing  to  NDS  priorities  of  increasing \nemployment and improving human development. \n \n8.  The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2014\u2013\n2016 to support the government\u2019s overarching strategic goal of inclusive and environmentally \nsustainable  growth,  and  to  help  Mongolia  adapt  to  climate  change  impacts  by  supporting \nefficient use and sustainable management of natural resources.9 It will contribute to ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2020\u2019s drivers of change, private sector development, gender equity, and partnerships, \nincluding cooperation with civil society.10 It is in line with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020\u2019s recommendation of promoting natural resources management through protection and \nmaintenance  of  forests,11 and  with  the  draft  operational  plan  for  agriculture  and  natural \nresources key priorities, such as enhanced renewable natural resources management.12 The TA \nis in the country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2014\u20132016.13 \n \n                                                \n8  Government of Mongolia. 2007.

The  TA  will  build  on  experiences  in  community-based  livelihood  gained  under  the \nPoverty Reduction through Community-Based Natural Resource Management (financed by the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction),14 focusing  further  on  SFM  planning,  and  will  explore \nsynergies with a proposed loan for Skills for Employment (45010), which is, among others, \nstriving to achieve better matches between sector needs and technical training programs. The \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Global Environment Facility, \nthe United Nations Development Programme, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, \nGIZ, nongovernment organizations (NGO) such as WWF, and other donors provide support to \nFUGs, forest inventory, and the forestry sector. The TA will benefit from exchanging lessons \nlearned with those programs. \n \n10.  There are no foreseen sensitive aspects or potential risks to the TA. Climate change \nposes a significant risk to long-term forest sustainability, although unlikely during the TA lifetime. \nThe TA will strengthen climate resilience by reducing the likelihood and impact of forest fires, \nand  will  test  the  replacement  of  fossil  fuels  with  deadwood.  The  TA  will  help  manage \nenvironmental risks and concerns following good international practices. Issues that will need to \nbe addressed during TA implementation include (i) sustainable yields of deadwood, and (ii) \nexistence of and access to markets. There will be no negative environmental or social impacts \nor restrictions as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  TA  impact  will  be  sustainable  livelihood  and  increased  resilience  of  forest \necosystems.  The  outcome  will  be  SFM  practices  developed  and  implemented  in  five \nnortheastern rural soums (districts) selected in aimags (provinces) with high levels of coverage \nby boreal forests and functioning FUGs.15 \n \n12.  The  TA  is  expected  to  improve  local  communities\u2019  livelihood  through  SFM.  It  will \ndemonstrate implementation of sound approaches following internationally accepted standards \nin geographically and socially comparable environments. It will improve the capacity of forestry \nline  agencies  to  protect  and  develop  project  area  forests  through  joint  planning  and \nmanagement with local stakeholders to reduce hazards to forests. It will directly involve about \n2,300 people and prioritize inclusion of low-income households and women. It will strengthen \nFUGs  established  prior  to  the  TA,  technical  and  business  management  capacity,  and \nemployment opportunities. The TA will build the forestry sector\u2019s capacity in adapting to climate \nchange impacts by managing climate risks such as forest fires and improving value chains, \nleading to more resilience of ecosystems and improved and stable livelihood. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  (i)  capacity  of  forest  management  line  agencies  in  SFM \nstrengthened, (ii) forest product value chains and FUG capacity improved, and (ii) technology \nfor wood processing systems demonstrated. \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2008.

Output  1:  Capacity  of  forest  management  line  agencies  in  sustainable  forest \nmanagement strengthened. Output 1 will undertake review and establish a knowledge base, \nincluding on gender issues, of available studies and research on SFM in similar geographical \nconditions and household fuel efficiency. The output will also liaise with GIZ, FAO, and other \ninternational and national stakeholders active in SFM in Mongolia to collect international good \npractice models available in Mongolia. The knowledge base will establish needs and capacity of \nforest  management  line  agencies  on  (i)  establishment  of  SFM  plans  and  capacity  of  line \nagencies, including forest units at aimag and soum levels; (ii) models for replacing coal fuel, and \nexploration of international experiences; (iii) establishment of future operations qualifying for \nfunding under the joint crediting mechanism between MEGD and the Government of Japan;16 \nand (iv) awareness-raising on alternative fuel for heating and SFM for the general public. All \nawareness-raising activities will be conducted in a gender-sensitive manner and contain gender \nelements, and gender sensitivity in the line agencies will be improved through organizational \ntraining. Ten FUGs from all aimags covered by boreal forests will be selected for capacity \nbuilding. Capacity building support may be extended to more forest units across Mongolia\u2019s \nforest aimags. The output will also establish baselines for TA implementation. \n \n15.  Output 2: Forest product value-chains and forest user group capacity improved. \nOutput 2 will provide capacity building to FUGs for (i) development of technical and business \nskills and value chain for deadwood processing, branding, and marketing, and for relations with \nthe private sector; (ii) development of marketing plans for deadwood; and (iii) improvement of \nSFM, including (a) implementation of forest management plans, (b) collection of deadwood, (c) \ncommunity-based forest management planning for FUGs, including deadwood extraction limits, \nand management of collected wood, including FUG umbrella organizations\u2019 strengthening, and \n(d) survey of volume and types of deadwood and non-timber forest products. The output will \ncoordinate with government and donor programs to train forest workers and FUG members on \nskills  needed  to  assist  FUGs  in  implementing  SFM.  The  output  will  determine  volume  of \ndeadwood  for  each  FUG,  as  well  as  the  sustainable  levels  of  deadwood  available  for \nprocessing. Selection criteria will be established for FUGs to further participate, dependent on \ntheir business management and technical capacities. Men and women in FUGs will participate \nequally in SFM plan development. Women will  be consulted, and their views reflected, in \nformulating SFM plans. Women will also be trained for FUG leadership positions under the TA. \n \n16.  Output 3: Technology for wood processing systems demonstrated. Output 3 will \nexplore  and  pilot  technologies  for  processing  extracted  deadwood,  and  seek  options  for \nincreasing fuel efficiency by testing (i) technology to process deadwood for furniture production; \n(ii) technology to process deadwood as fuel for heating; and (iii) technology for improved fuel \nefficiency and building insulation. Output 3 will also pursue cooperation with the private sector \nand  other  stakeholders  on  technology  implementation.  FUGs  and  business  entities  will \nparticipate provided they consent to ensure management, operation and maintenance, and \nprocessing of agreed quantities of deadwood at established quality standards. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.
