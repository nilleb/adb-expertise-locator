The  long-term  strategic  framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  its \npoverty  reduction  strategy  require  ADB  to  promote  sustainable  development  across  its \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs).  Both  documents  focus  on  the  need  to  strengthen \ngovernance,  promote  private  sector  development,  and  encourage  effective  financial \nmanagement in accordance with international standards and best practices. ADB\u2019s strategic \nframework  recognizes  the  importance  of  building  the  capacity  to  enforce  improved  and \ntransparent financial disclosure standards by DMCs\u2019 public and private sectors to improve the \nefficiency of their institutions and promote sustainable economic growth. \n \n2.  ADB has thus far provided the Central Asian republics (CARs) and Mongolia (collectively \nreferred to hereafter as transitional economies [TEs]), with three regional technical assistance \n(RETA)  grants  for  enhancing  their  financial  management,  governance,  and  disclosure \nstandards.1 ADB has also provided the CARs and Azerbaijan with a separate RETA for financial \nsector development.2 In addition, ADB provided Mongolia with three country-specific TAs for \nenhancing financial disclosure standards.3 ADB\u2019s Corporate Governance Program Loan and TA \n(para. 4) to the Kyrgyz Republic also facilitated improved accounting standards. Drawing on the \nexperiences gained and lessons learned from the above TAs and RETAs, the present RETA4 \nwill focus on strengthening accounting standards in line with International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRS)5 and auditing standards in line with International Standards of Auditing (ISA) \nin four selected TEs: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan. The RETA will \ntrain regulators for better enforcement of such standards while fostering knowledge sharing in \napplying IFRS and ISA. Adopting an integrated approach, the RETA will identify and address, \non a country-specific basis, weaknesses in the institutional, legal, and regulatory frameworks of \nthe four TEs in the adoption of IFRS and enforcement of ISA. An integrated approach to these \nmatters has the benefit of encouraging better interface and debate on the common problems by \nexploiting synergies and sharing experiences across the TEs while adopting a cost-effective \napproach to such questions. The regional interface sought under the RETA will complement \n(and  not  substitute  for)  the  country-specific  focus  envisaged,  given  the  differing  levels  of \nprogress in accounting reforms made by the four countries. The RETA inputs will be used to \ndevelop country-specific action plans for strengthening financial disclosure standards in the four \ncountries, allowing them to benefit from opportunities afforded by sharing of experiences. The \nRETA\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Enactment  and  enforcement  of  transparent  financial  disclosure  standards  pose  a \nparticular challenge  for  TEs,  given  the  nascent  state  of their  regulatory  and  jurisprudence \n                                                 \n1  These are (i) ADB. 1999.

Regional Technical Assistance for Regional Financial Sector Development. Manila (TA 6137-REG). \nThis  RETA  focused  on  transparent  financial  disclosure  and  prudential  financial  regulation  and  supervision \nstandards. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan participated in this RETA\u2019s deliberations. \n3 These are (i) ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Improving Accounting and Auditing Systems. Manila \n(TA 2390-MON); (ii) ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Improving Accounting and Auditing Systems. \nManila (TA 2964-MON); and (iii) ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Capacity Building for Accounting \nand Auditing Professionals. Manila (TA 3913-MON). \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 16 May 2005. \n5  International Accounting Standards (IAS) was reclassified as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in \n2001 by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of the International Federation of Accountants \n(IFAC). \n ", "2   \nsystems (Appendix 2). Nonetheless, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan \nrecognize the importance of sound, uniform, and transparent financial disclosure standards to \nprovide comprehensive information about transactions and institutions undertaking them. The \nfour  countries  face  generally  common  constraints  and  have  broadly  similar  objectives  in \naccounting and auditing sector reforms (para. 8), which is why they were selected for this \nRETA. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Mongolia have enacted enabling legislation aimed at \nhaving IFRS-compliant accounting laws and ISA-compliant audit laws. In actual practice, their \naccounting and auditing sector reforms have been varied and their devolution asymmetrical \n(Appendix 2). Empirical evidence shows that, in countries where ADB\u2019s intervention was active, \nsectoral reforms have been faster. \n \n4.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  accounting  and  auditing  sector  reforms  are  particularly \nimpressive  (Appendix  2).  Pursuant  to  the  conditionalities  of  ADB\u2019s  Corporate  Governance \nReform Program Loan,6 the country\u2019s new accounting law requires all listed companies to have \ntheir financial statements prepared according to IFRS. Amendments to the audit law required all \naudits  to  be  conducted  according  to  ISA.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  transferred  the  power  to \nsupervise and regulate the accounting and auditing profession from the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) to an independent agency\u2015the State Commission for Financial Reporting and Auditing \n(SCFRA). \n \n5.  Mongolia, another early reformer (Appendix 2), also has accounting and auditing laws \nmandating compliance with IFRS and ISA, respectively. Under the conditionalities of ADB\u2019s \nSecond Phase of the Governance Reform Program Loan,7 amendments have been proposed to \nthe accounting and auditing laws for the transfer of MOF\u2019s functions of supervision, regulation, \nand licensing of auditors to the Mongolia Institute of Certified Public Accountants (MICPA), a \nprofessional  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO)  now  a  member  of  the  Confederation  of \nAccountants of the Pacific and Asia (CAPA), which is the regional grouping of International \nFederation of Accountants (IFAC). \n \n6.  Kazakhstan  has  been  a  very  keen  albeit  (a  relatively)  late  reformer  (Appendix  2). \nRecognizing the need for transparent financial disclosure, Kazakhstan enacted the Law on \nAccounting and Financial Reporting in June 2002. An amendment to the law (in June 2004) \nrequired all publicly traded companies to use IFRS by January 2005 and other companies by 2 \nJanuary 2006. A new draft Audit Law (2005) currently under parliamentary discussion requires \ncompanies  to  have  their  financial  statements  audited  in  accordance  with  ISA  beginning  1 \nJanuary 2006. It also stipulates that practicing auditors must be accredited by the Chamber of \nAuditors  (COA).  Thus  far,  COA  is  the  only  Kazakh  SRO  to  have  IFAC  membership.  The \nauditors\u2019 supervision and licensing function will be retained by MOF, while its professional \nregulation and quality control function will be delegated to COA. \n \n7.  Uzbekistan\u2019s accounting and auditing reform progress has been relatively slower than \nthat  of  the  three  other  TEs  (Appendix  2).  Its  accounting  and  auditing  laws  still  mandate \ncompanies and auditors to follow its national accounting and auditing standards rather than \nIFRS  and  ISA.  Uzbek  national  accounting  standards  differ  from  IFRS  in  (i)  valuation  of \ninventories, work in progress, and accounts receivable; (ii) provision of employees\u2019 pensions \nand gratuities; and (iii) consolidation of group companies\u2019 accounts (Appendix 2). MOF has the \npower of regulation, supervision, and licensing of auditors. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

Manila (Loan 2010-MON). ", "  3\n \n8.  Some common generic constraints to the adoption of IFRS and the enforcement of ISA \nwere observed in the four TEs. These are (i) lack of adequate knowledge among supervisors, \npracticing accountants, and auditors of post-2003 IFRS and ISA developments and IFAC\u2019s \nprofessional ethics due to the lack of (a) textbooks in the local languages, and (b) opportunities \nfor continuing professional education; (ii) lack of sufficiently independent and IFAC-compliant \nSROs to set accounting and auditing standards and to regulate and supervise the profession; \n(iii)  lack  of  normative  guidelines  for  practicing  accountants,  auditors,  and  regulators  in \ninterpreting and implementing IFRS and ISA; and (iv) conflicts between the countries\u2019 civil and \ntax  codes  and  IFRS  principles  (Appendix  2),  which  impinge  on  the  latter\u2019s  application  by \ncompanies. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s RETA on Regional Financial Sector Development (footnote 2) sought to address \nthe above constraints partially by assisting nonfinancial joint stock companies (NFJSCs) to use \nIFRS as their accounting standards. In this direction, the RETA specifically (i) undertook a \nsurvey on NFJSCs\u2019 compliance with IFRS, (ii) assisted MOFs to begin or continue implementing \nIFRS guidelines based on best international practice, (iii) identified some constraints to IFRS \nimplementation  in  NFJSCs,  (iv)  conducted  practical  IFRS  workshops  for  accountants  from \nNFJSCs,  and  (v)  conducted  two  regional  training  workshops  on  IFRS  implementation  for \nregulators and key participants in those countries. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment\u2019s (USAID) Central Asia Accounting Reform Program (CAARP) and its Enterprise \nDevelopment  Program  (EDP)  sought  to  create  a  regional  accounting  infrastructure  by \nsupporting  education  and  setting  examination  standards  for  a  critical  mass  of  IFRS \nknowledgeable accountants (Appendix 2). ADB\u2019s three TAs to Mongolia (footnote 3) sought the \nsame objective. \n \n10.  The  present  RETA  will  concentrate  on  facilitating  the  implementation  of  IFRS  and \nparticularly ISA to joint-stock companies in the four TEs. In doing so, it will complement and \ncontinue the efforts of ADB\u2019s earlier RETAs (paras. 2 and 9) and its country-specific loans and \nTAs to Mongolia and the Kyrgyz Republic (paras. 2, 4, and 5).8 This RETA will facilitate the \napplication by USAID-trained accountants of IFRS and the enforcement of ISA by regulators, \nthereby complementing CAARP\u2019s and EDP\u2019s efforts. The outcome will be facilitated by (i) \nproviding methodologies for addressing legal and regulatory impediments to the application of \nISA; (ii) training regulators on the updated IFRS and ISA; (iii) providing methodologies for \nreconciling income and asset values computed according to IFRS standards and those by local \ntax  authorities;  (iv)  providing  specific  guidelines  in  interpreting  and  implementing  ISA;  (v) \nrecommending criteria for entry and continued membership in the profession; (vi) translating \nauditing  textbooks,  ISA,  and  other  updated  relevant  material  into  Russian  and  Mongolian \n(without  duplicating  what  has  already  been  translated  by  USAID  under  its  EDP);  (vii) \nestablishing criteria for domestic audit firms\u2019 audit of public-listed companies; and (viii) after \ncompletion of the country-specific domestic training programs, conducting a regional seminar \nthat would provide an interface for the regulators from the four TEs to share their knowledge in \napplying IFRS and ISA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  In the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia, this RETA will assist in the practical applications of post-2003 IFRS and \nparticularly ISA principles. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The RETA will impact positively on good governance in the corporate and financial \nsectors  at  country  and  regional  levels.  The  RETA\u2019s  outcome  will  be  improved  quality  of \naccounting standards in the four TEs in line with IFRS and auditing standards in line with ISA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The RETA will enhance the regulators\u2019 capacity for setting accounting and auditing \nstandards and carrying out quality control, through both country-specific and regional training to \nregulators. Providing a common forum for participants to discuss and ameliorate their common \ngeneric constraints will foster better knowledge sharing among countries and thereby enhance \nregional cooperation. Drawing on this work, the RETA will develop country-specific action plans \nto improve financial disclosures. Specifically, the TA will undertake the following:  \n \n13.  Formulate guidelines in interpreting and implementing ISA. The RETA will examine \nthe countries\u2019 audit laws and, where required, provide definitive and normative guidelines for \ninterpreting and implementing ISA-compliant provisions of audit laws. \n  \n14.  Build local ISA-compliant audit capacity. The RETA will (i) facilitate translation and \npublication  of  current  IFRS,  ISA,  and  other  relevant  material  (para.  10)  into  Russian  and \nMongolian; (ii) research and analyze local audit firms\u2019 audit capabilities in implementing IFRS \nand  ISA;  (iii)  recommend  minimum  qualifications  and  entry  requirements  into  the  auditing \nprofessions in the four TEs; and (iv) establish criteria for domestic audit firms\u2019 audit of public \nlisted companies. \n \n15.  Train  regulators.  The  RETA  will  train  regulators  from  the  four  TEs  in  (i)  impartial \napplication of IFRS and ISA, (ii) tax reconciliation procedures, and (iii) developing ISA-compliant \naudit interpretation and implementation guidelines (para. 14). \n \n16.  Conduct a seminar as interface for country participants. After completion of the \nactivities listed in paras. 13\u201315 within each country, the RETA will organize a seminar to provide \nan  interface  for  regulators  from  the  four  TEs  to  share  knowledge  and  experience  in \nimplementing IFRS and ISA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $500,000 entirely in foreign exchange. The \nRETA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Detailed cost estimates \nare in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. The Governance, Finance, and Trade \nDivision of the East and Central Asia Department will administer and implement the RETA with \nsupport from financial sector regulators and other stakeholders. MOFs in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, \nUzbekistan, and SCFRA in the Kyrgyz Republic, will be the RETA\u2019s implementing agencies \n(IAs).  Consultants  will  procure  equipment9  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \n                                                 \n9  Equipment to be purchased includes computers, facsimile machines, and photocopiers. After completion of the TA, \nsuch equipment will be handed over to the implementing agencies of countries where such equipment was used. ", "  5\nProcurement. The counterpart IAs  will guide the consultants\u2019 research, facilitate access to \nrelevant government agencies and officials, and provide necessary information. The RETA will \nstart in April 2006 and be completed by October 2006. \n \n19.  The RETA will require 21 person-months of consulting services (5 international and 16 \ndomestic) between April and October 2006. The international consultant (5 person-months) will \nbe the team leader/accountant. The four domestic consultants (4 person-months each) will be \naccountants, one from each country. The five consultants will be assisted by counterpart staff \nfrom the four countries\u2019 counterpart agencies. The four countries\u2019 IAs will be requested to \nprovide the team leader and the domestic consultants with office space during the RETA\u2019s \nimplementation. An international firm of consultants will be selected using ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based  consultants\u2019  selection  method,  using  the  biodata  technical  proposal  method  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for selecting domestic consultants. Selection of a firm for this purpose will \nfacilitate better coordination between the team leader and the four domestic consultants in the \nfour countries covered. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for consultants. \n \n20.  The team leader, with the help of the domestic consultants, will conduct training courses \nfor practicing regulators. The courses will be customized to fit the requirements of each country \nand are expected to be conducted in August 2006. A regional seminar will be conducted in \nOctober 2006 after the consultants complete their diagnostic and advisory work and domestic \ntraining activities.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing Financial Disclosure Standards in Transitional Economies, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \n  Mechanisms   \n \nImpact       \n       \nGood governance in the  Visible corporate and  Annual reports of the  Assumption \ncorporate sectors of  financial frauds by companies  listed companies and  Governments\u2019 \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic,  listed in stock exchanges and  their regulators in the  commitment to good \nMongolia, and Uzbekistan   supervised by the exchanges\u2019  four transitional  corporate and financial \n  regulators reduced by 33% in  economies (TEs)  governance, \n2007 compared with 2004  beginning 1 January  demonstrated by their \n2007  capacity and willingness \n  to punish impartially acts \nReports by the ministries  of fraudulent, \nof finance (MOFs) and  nontransparent, and \nother statutory  noncomprehensive \nregulators of stock  financial disclosure by \nexchanges  companies, accountants, \n  auditors, and regulators \n \nOutcome       \n       \nImproved quality of  70% of all listed companies  Annual audited financial  Assumptions \naccounting standards in line  and 50% of all nonlisted  statements of listed  Governments\u2019 \nwith International Financial  companies in the four TEs  companies  commitment to the \nReporting Standards (IFRS)  adopting IFRS and complying    application of IFRS and \nand auditing standards in line  with ISA beginning 1 January  Reports from MOFs and  the enforcement of ISA \nwith International Standards  2007  other regulators or  by accountants, auditors, \nof Auditing (ISA) in all four  supervisors of the  and regulators \nTEs  accounting and auditing   \n  professions in the four  Transparency in \n  TEs  governments\u2019 corporate \n  and regulators\u2019 reports \nCountries\u2019 laws on   \naccounting to determine  Risks \nIFRS compliance, and  Due to outward migration, \nlaws on auditing to  lack of trained \ndetermine ISA  accountants and auditors \ncompliance  to apply IFRS and ISA in \n  the actual practice of \nBack-to-office reports  accounting and auditing  \n(BTORs) of Asian   \nDevelopment Bank  Lack of continued \n(ADB) review missions  regional dialogue \n  between the four TEs\u2019 \nregulators and the \naccounting and auditing \nprofessions \nOutputs       \n       \n1.

For  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  and  Uzbekistan,  four  transitional \neconomies (TEs) from the erstwhile Soviet bloc selected for this regional technical assistance \n(RETA), adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)1 and rigorously enforcing \nInternational Standards of Auditing (ISA) present a particular challenge, given the nascent stage \nof  the  development  of  their  legal,  regulatory,  and  jurisprudence  systems  and  the  different \npurposes accounting and auditing served during the days of central planning. The countries\u2019 \noriginal accounting and auditing systems were designed to provide information necessary for \nthe operation of a centrally planned economy. In such a system, state agencies were the only \nusers of accounting information. The prime function of accounting was to monitor and control \nthe use of economic resources to meet planned targets. This system of accounting differed \nsubstantially  from  IFRS  in  (i)  matching  costs  to  revenues,  (ii)  valuation  of  assets,  (iii) \ncomputation of the cost of production, (iv) preference for legal form over substance as the basis \nfor  presentation,  and  (v)  the  treatment  of  owners\u2019  equity.  Auditing  in  a  centrally  planned \neconomy  was  limited  to  an  inspection  function  where  compliance  with  regulation  took \nprecedence  over  truth  and  fairness.  Since  enterprises  were  wholly  state-owned  and  their \ncreditors  were  also  the  state  or  other  state-owned  enterprises,  the  need  for  independent \nfinancial control and reporting was never appreciated. \n \n2.  The TEs\u2019 former accounting and auditing systems were inappropriate to the needs of a \nmarket economy toward which these TEs were moving albeit at varying speeds. Inevitably, the \ndichotomy created regulatory gray areas, which allowed financial irregularities, improprieties, \nand illegalities in the TEs\u2019 enterprise and financial sectors. These infractions were undoubtedly \nexacerbated by weak economic management, poor governance structures, and weak legal and \nregulatory frameworks. Lack of transparency in financial disclosure was a serious detriment to \ninvestor confidence for the countries in transition. \n \n3.  Another major and congenital constraint to the creation of rigorous auditing standards \nhas been the conflict between some IFRS and ISA principles on one hand and the four TEs\u2019 \nCivil Code and Tax Code on the other. In some instances, provisions of these laws have \nimpeded  the  application  of  IFRS  and  enforcement  of  ISA,  particularly  in  areas  such  as \ndepreciation accounting, provision of gratuity and pension liabilities, and valuation of foreign \nexchange-denominated assets and liabilities. The origins of this conflict may be attributed to the \nfour TEs\u2019 socialist civil law legacy, where provisions of the Civil Code overrode those of other \nstatutes (and in socialist times could not be questioned by the courts). The goals of revenue \ncollection are different from the needs of investors, which IFRS and ISA can satisfy. Moreover, \nas the ministries of finance (MOFs) or the tax committees (which were spun off from MOFs) are \nalso responsible for revenue collection, they have generally allowed the countries\u2019 tax codes to \noverride the provisions of their accountancy and audit laws where revenue collections were \naffected. Although differences between financial and tax reporting are common in developed \ncountries, they are new to accountants and tax collectors in TEs. \n \n4.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  sound  and  rigorous  financial  standards  for  good \ngovernance, efficient financial intermediation, and sustainable growth, the four TEs, at varying \n                                                 \n1  The International Accounting Standards (IAS) was renamed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in \n2001 by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of the International Federation of Accountants \n(IFAC). \n ", "10   Appendix 2 \nspeeds  and  with  the  help  of  development  partners,  have  undertaken  steps  to  adopt \ninternationally accepted accounting and auditing standards.  \n \n5.  The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided two RETA \ngrants to the Central Asia Accounting Reform Project (CAARP) between 1995 and 2000 and the \nEnterprise Development Program (EDP)2, which is currently ongoing. USAID\u2019s assistance under \nthe two programs supported five critical components: (i) initiation of the process of creating an \nenabling legal and regulatory environment for the adoption of IFRS (through translation of IFRS \nstandards into Russian and drawing up charts of accounts consistent with IFRS standards for \naccountants in the five countries to follow); (ii) training, testing, and certification of professional \naccountants  through  the  Certified  Accounting  Practitioner  (CAP)  and  Certified  International \nPracticing Accountants (CIPA) programs; (iii) reform of accounting education to incorporate the \nCIPA/CAP curriculum; (iv) support for an institutional framework to strengthen market economy \naccountancy; and (v) utilization of accounting information for decision making, particularly at the \nenterprise level. USAID\u2019s CAARP and EDP sought to establish the basic training and education \ninfrastructure for creating a critical mass of IFRS-knowledgeable accountants in the region. \n \n6.  USAID, through CAARP and EDP, has supported the establishment of a not-for-profit \nentity, the Certification of International Professional Accountant Examination Network (CIPA-\nEN) Program. CIPA-EN was recently registered in the United States. CIPA-EN\u2019s functions \ninclude  (i)  developing  examinations,  including  disseminating  the  content  outlines; \n(ii) administering examinations; (iii) grading examinations; and (iv) maintaining database records \nof examination participants and outcomes. While CIPA-EN manages the examination process, \nactual certification is done by national professional associations supported by USAID. The goal \nof  the  CAP/CIPA  program  is  to  create  professional  accountants  that  meet  international, \ntechnical, and professional standards but are also prepared in the competencies required in the \nunique environment of TEs. In addition, the program aims to promote regional economic and \nprofessional integration, by creating a common certification framework that can be implemented \nin all countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU). \n \n7.  As part of its program to support economic and professional integration in the FSU, \nUSAID has supported the Eurasian Council of Certified Accountants and Auditors (ECCAA).3 \nECCAA comprises progressive professional accounting and audit associations in all five Central \nAsian republics, Moldova, Russian Federation, and Ukraine, with International Federation of \nAccountants  (IFAC)-compatible  charters  and  CAP/CIPA  examination-based  membership \nrequirements. IFAC recently recognized ECCAA as the regional grouping representing national \nprofessional accounting and audit associations in the FSU for IFAC. \n \n8.  In addition to supporting the CAP/CIPA program as the basis for high professional and \ntechnical  standards  for  members,  ECCAA  promotes  the  adoption  of  all  IFAC\u2019s  education \nstandards,  statements  of  membership  obligations,  as  well  as  International  Accounting \nStandards (IAS) and International Standards of Auditing (ISA) in each FSU country. ECCAA \nalso intends to develop a library of key accounting documents and promote the development \nand publication of accounting materials, including in the area of training and education. The \nEDP is working with ECCAA to develop a strategic action plan for sustainability through member \nassociation dues, certificate fees, and publishing revenues.  \n                                                 \n2  The Enterprise Development Program (EDP) covers Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan. Neither CAARP nor EDP covered Mongolia. \n3  In  May  2005,  the  Eurasian  Council  of  Certified  Accountants  and  Auditors  (ECCAA)  was  renamed  as  the \nInternational Council of Certified Accountants and Auditors (ICCAA). \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n9.  While seeking to create a critical mass of accountants with basic knowledge of IFRS,  \nthe four TEs still need more assistance in applying such knowledge on a practical and functional \nbasis. The following paragraphs describe the progress, issues, and challenges faced by each \ncountry. \n \nA.  Kyrgyz Republic \n \n10.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s efforts at accounting and auditing reforms, though recent, are by \nfar the most impressive among the four TEs. They are also largely due to interventions from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The Kyrgyz Republic enacted its accounting law in 1995 and \nits auditing law in 1996. The former required all companies in the Kyrgyz Republic to have their \naccounts prepared according to Kyrgyzstan Accounting Standards (KYAS). The latter required \ntheir audit according to Kyrgyzstan Standards of Auditing (KYSA). KYAS and KYSA were \nestablished with assistance from USAID\u2019s CAARP and were derived from the 1995 versions of \nIAS and ISA. The Kyrgyz Republic enacted (i) a new accounting law in April 2002, which \nsuperseded the 1995 accounting law; and (ii) major amendments to its auditing law in July \n2002, as conditions for the release of the second tranche of ADB\u2019s Corporate Governance and \nEnterprise Reform Program II.4  \n \n11.  Government  Resolution  No.  593,  adopted  on  28  September  2001,  required  all \ncompanies in the Kyrgyz Republic to follow IFRS by 2004 under the new accounting law of \n2002. With assistance from ADB\u2019s TA loan,5 all banks in the country had their 2002 and 2003 \nfinancial statements prepared according to IFRS and audited according to ISA. However, many \nsmaller  and  nonlisted  companies  were  unable  to  comply  with  this  requirement  and  the \nGovernment deferred compliance to 2006 for nonlisted companies.  \n \n12.  Two main professional accounting associations, the Commission of Accountants and \nAuditors  and  the  Union  of  Accountants  and  Auditors,  are  registered  in  the  country  as \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). Neither is an IFAC member, though the latter is now an \nassociate IFAC member.  \n \n13.  The Law on Auditing mandates the oversight, licensing, and regulation of the accounting \nand  auditing  profession  to  the  State  Commission  on  Financial  Reporting  and  Auditing \n(SCFRA).6 The Kyrgyz Republic was the first TE to transfer the supervision, oversight, and \nlicensing of auditors from MOF to another body. ADB supported SCFRA under TA 3779-KGZ7 \nand RETA 6137.8 \n \n14.  The principal accounting and auditing reform challenges faced by the Kyrgyz Republic \nare (i) limited technical skills by domestic accountants and auditors in understanding IAS, IFRS, \nand ISA despite progress made under the EDP (paras. 4\u20138); (ii) limited absorption of IAS, IFRS, \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

Mongolia \n15.  Mongolia was an early reformer. The country\u2019s accounting and auditing reforms began in \n1993 with assistance from the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank for \nintroducing the double entry accrual accounting system in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \nADB provided Mongolia with a TA in 19959 which assisted the country in drafting an IAS-\ncompliant accounting law and an ISA-compliant audit law, and the creation of a charter and \nbylaws  for  the  Mongolia  Institute  of  Certified  Professional  Accountants  (MICPA),  the \nprofessional  accounting  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO).  ADB  provided  Mongolia  with  a \nsecond TA in 1997,10 which (i) helped train 100 accountants in the application of IAS, (ii) helped \nMICPA conduct its first examination using a new IAS-compatible syllabus, and (iii) facilitated \nMICPA\u2019s admittance to the Confederation of Accountants of the Pacific and Asia (CAPA).11 In \n2002, ADB provided Mongolia with a third TA12 in 2002 to enable MICPA to build a critical mass \nof accountants and auditors familiar with IAS and ISA.  \n \n16.  MICPA now conducts examinations in Mongolia. However, MOF still (i) awards audit and \naccounting  practice  certificates  to  accountants,  (ii)  regulates  entry  into  the  profession,  (iii) \nenforces the Audit Law, and (iv) monitors audit firms\u2019 conduct. Under the proposed amendments \nto the laws on accounting and auditing (currently being debated by Parliament), those functions \nwill  be  transferred  to  MICPA.13  These  measures  initiated  by  the  Government  clearly \ndemonstrate its intention to achieve far-reaching accounting and auditing reforms.  \n \n17.  MICPA\u2019s weaknesses have been its inadequate capacity to enforce IFRS and ISA as \neffectively as MICPA and the Government desire. To undertake added responsibilities bestowed \non it, MICPA needs assistance in (i) the translation of the latest IFRS and ISA into Mongolian, \n(ii) methodologies for reconciling of income computed using IFRS standards and local tax laws, \n(iii) giving further practical training to its members in applying IFRS and ISA, (iv) training the \nregulators (now MICPA itself) in the enforcement of IFRS and ISA, and (v) developing ISA-\ncompliant audit guidelines for its members. The present RETA will enable Mongolia to address \nthese issues. \n                                                 \n9  These are (i) ADB. 1995.

A  presidential \ndecree issued on 26 December 1995, and having the force of law requires legal entities in \nKazakhstan to maintain their accounts according to Kazakhstan Accounting Standards (KAS), \nwhich broadly followed IAS prevalent in 1995. The decree underwent minor amendments in \n1997, 1999, and 2001, which also included some amendments to the Civil Code. On 24 June \n2002, the Law on Accounting and Financial Reporting (LAFR) replaced the presidential decree. \nAn amendment dated 11 June 2004 required all publicly listed companies to convert from KAS \nto IFRS beginning 1 January 2005, and all other companies to follow suit beginning 1 January \n2006. Institutional capacity among accountants to apply standards and MOF to enforce them \nremained weak due to their limited practical knowledge about IAS and even more so about \nIFRS. However, Kazakh subsidiaries of foreign companies and other Kazakh companies having \nforeign equity have already been following IFRS and ISA as required under the reporting \nregulations of the domiciles of their holding companies or foreign investors. \n \n19.  The Law on Auditing was enacted in November 1998 and amended on 15 January 2001. \nThe law mandates powers of licensing and supervising auditors, i.e., entry regulation and \noversight to MOF\u2019s Department of Accounting and Auditing Methodology (DAAM). The law \nestablished an independent Qualification Commission for certifying (already licensed) auditors. \nIt also requires that auditors have adequate insurance and that not less than 51% of the share \nof any audit firm must be held by licensed auditors. \n \n20.  With  support  from  USAID\u2019s  CAARP  and  EDP,  Kazakhstan  (i)  introduced  basic \namendments to its LAFR and Law on Audit, (ii) updated IAS and ISA standards in the country, \n(iii) conducted CIPA-EN examinations for accountants in the country, and (iv) established the \nChamber of Auditors (COA), Kazakhstan\u2019s only professional accounting and auditing SRO with \nIFAC membership. ADB\u2019s RETA14 approved in 2003 assisted Kazakhstan\u2019s DAAM in drafting \nIFRS conversion manuals and undertaking training for selected companies. The European \nUnion Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States provided Kazakhstan \nwith technical assistance (TA) in 2005 to facilitate (i) reviewing legislation to eliminate legal \nconflicts  in  IFRS  introduction  and  ISA  enforcement,  (ii)  training  DAAM  of  MOF  to  better \nunderstand  IFRS,  and  (iii)  developing  an  IFRS  glossary.  The  World  Bank  is  currently \nundertaking its Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC) for Kazakhstan since 23 May 2005, \nand results will be known in August 2005. The ROSC will assess the convergence of LAFR with \nIFRS and the Law on Audit with ISA, and the degree to which accountants, auditors, and \nregulators implement these laws. \n \n21.  A new draft law on audit submitted to Parliament on 7 May 2005 (i) requires all audits to \nbe in accordance with ISA beginning 1 January 2006, (ii) requires every practicing auditor in \nKazakhstan to be a member of COA, and (iii) mandates DAAM\u2019s responsibility for licensing \nauditors while delegating its professional regulation and quality control functions to COA. The \nspirit of the new law indicates the Government\u2019s intention of moving from the role of an activist \nregulator  to  a  prudential  supervisor  of  the  auditing  profession,  and  is  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s other economic policies.  \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2003. Regional Technical Assistance for Regional Financial Sector Development. Manila (TA 6137-REG). \nThis  RETA  focused  on  transparent  financial  disclosure  and  prudential  financial  regulation  and  supervision \nstandards. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan participated in this RETA\u2019s deliberations. \n ", "14   Appendix 2 \n22.  The main challenges faced by Kazakhstan\u2019s accounting and auditing professions are \n(i) the  need  for  reconciling  the  IFRS  and  domestic  tax  accounting  system,  (ii)  training  for \nregulators (both DAAM and COA) in IFRS and ISA implementation, (iii) enhancing professional \nentry qualifications, (iv) enhancing accountants\u2019 and auditors\u2019 efficacy in implementing ISA and \nin their accounting and auditing practices, (v) translation of ISA into Russian/Kazakh, and (vi) \nthe need for guidelines for implementing ISA. \n \nD.  Uzbekistan \n23.  Uzbekistan\u2019s accounting and auditing reforms have been slower than those of the three \nother TEs. Uzbekistan enacted its Law on Accounting on 30 August 1996, which required all \nUzbek companies to follow Uzbek National Accounting Standards (UNAS) effective 1 January \n1997. UNAS was a modified version of IAS prevalent in 1996. As of 1 January 2001, there were \n17 UNAS. UNAS differ from IFRS in (i) valuation of inventories, work in progress, and accounts \nreceivable; (ii) provision of employees\u2019 pensions and gratuities; and (iii) consolidation of group \ncompanies\u2019  accounts.  The  accounting  law  set  out  the  Chart  of  Accounts  and  instructions \nestablished with assistance from USAID\u2019s CAARP.  \n \n24.  The auditing law enacted in 2000 stipulates that all audit firms must be registered with \nthe Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and licensed with MOF. MOF is also mandated to design, approve, \nand regulate auditing norms and compliance; regulate qualification for entry into the profession; \napprove and conduct examinations; and grant, suspend, and revoke auditors\u2019 licenses. The \naudit law requires auditors to follow Uzbek National Standards of Auditing (UNSA), which were \nderived from ISA prevalent in 2000.  \n \n25.  Thus far, there is no information on any significant amendments to legislation in the \ndirection of IFRS and ISA. The country reportedly has 537 domestic audit firms and 5,000 \nlicensed  auditors.  The  main  professional  accounting  body,  the  National  Association  of \nAccountants and Auditors (NAAA), established in March 1992, is registered as an NGO with \nMOJ and since 2000 has been an associate member of IFAC. Support for training NAAA \nmembers has been received from USAID under CAARP and from the British Council. MOF\u2019s \nAccounting  and  Auditing  Methodology  Department  (AAMD)  is  responsible  for  licensing, \nregulating,  and  supervising  the  auditing  profession.  The  problems  faced  by  the  country\u2019s \ndomestic  auditors  are  (i)  limited  exposure  to  ISA,  (ii)  limited  nonactivist  regulation  of  the \nprofession,  (iii) lack  of  continuing  professional  education,  and  (iv)  the  country\u2019s  tax  code \noverriding its accounting law and audit law in the accounting concept of materiality in all tax-\nrelated cases. \n \n26.  A bill to amend the Law on Audit was scheduled to be discussed before the Uzbek \nNational Parliament in June 2005. The proposed amendments in the bill were (i) increasing \nauditors\u2019 mandatory professional indemnity, (ii) changing audit firms\u2019 reporting structures and \nincreasing their minimum partners from two to three, and (iii) increasing continuing professional \neducation for practicing auditors to a minimum of 2 weeks a year. There are no indications of \nany movement toward ISA.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  15 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($) \n \n    Total \nItem    Cost \nA.

Introduction \n1.  A team of one international consultant and four domestic consultants will be recruited to \nprovide a total of 21 person-months (5 international and 16 domestic) services between April \nand October 2006. The international consultant (5 person-months) will be the team leader and \nwill  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the  team\u2019s  output.  The  four  domestic  consultants  (4 \nperson-months  each)  will  be  selected  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  on  the \nrecommendation of the team leader in consultation with the ministries of finance (MOFs) in \nKazakhstan, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan, and the State Commission on Financial Reporting and \nAuditing (SCFRA) in the Kyrgyz Republic. The expertise and the job requirements are in paras. \n3\u20138. The five consultants will be assisted by counterpart staff provided by MOFs and SCFRA. \nMOF and SCFRA will also provide office space for the domestic consultants. Since the team \nleader will be based in Almaty during the regional technical assistance (RETA), the Kazakhstan \nimplementing agency will be requested to facilitate or provide the team leader with office space \nin Almaty. The consultants\u2019 output will be subject to review and evaluation by the Governments \nand ADB. An international firm of consultants will be selected using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting domestic consultants. \n \nA.  Reporting Requirements \n2.  Within 2 weeks of the start of their assignment, the four domestic consultants will submit \ninception reports to the team leader and simultaneously to ADB. The team leader will give ADB \na comprehensive inception report consolidating the individual inception reports. Each inception \nreport will contain detailed work plans to be undertaken by each consultant. The domestic \nconsultants will submit monthly reports to the team leader. One month before the seminar, the \ndomestic consultants will furnish the team leader with draft final reports on the assignments in \neach country. The team leader will submit to ADB and the Governments a comprehensive and \nconsolidated  draft  final  report  2  weeks  before  the  seminar,  and  the  final  report  after \nincorporating discussions/comments made at the seminar at the RETA\u2019s completion. \n \nB.  Team Leader/International Consultant \n3.  The team leader will be a chartered accountant/certified public accountant who will be a \nmember of an International Federation of Accountants (IFAC)  member institute. The team \nleader will require knowledge and experience in (i) introducing International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRS) and implementing International Standards of Auditing (ISA) in transitional \neconomies  (TEs),  (ii)  possible  areas  of  conflict  between  IFRS  and  ISA  and  the  legal \ninfrastructure in TEs, and proven past experience in addressing them, (iii) capacity building for \nnascent accounting and auditing professional self-regulatory organizations (SROs), (iv) issuing \nguidelines for implementation and interpretation of IFRS and ISA in TEs\u2019 legal systems, and (v) \ntraining regulators and accountants from TEs in the disciplines in (i)\u2013(iv).
