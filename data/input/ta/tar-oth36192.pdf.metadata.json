The  Pacific  Strategy  for  the  New  Millennium  2000\u20132004  focuses  on  five  strategic \nobjectives: (i) sound economic management, good governance, and public sector reform; (ii) \nprivate sector development; (iii) improvement of women\u2019s welfare in the social, economic, and \npolitical  spheres;  (iv)  supporting  sustainable  environment  management;  and  (v)  supporting \npoverty reduction as a unifying theme.  Assistance efforts in the Pacific have focused on the role \nof governance in the economic development process. As part of these efforts, governance \nassessments have been conducted in several Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n2.  One preliminary finding of the governance assessments is a lack of understanding \namong ordinary citizens, especially those in rural and island communities and villages, of the \nconcept of governance as it is practiced at the national level. The technical assistance (TA)1 \naims to examine, through collaboration with a Pacific regional nongovernment organization, the \nrole of citizens and leaders in a democracy, differences between traditional and modern forms \nof  governance,  and  strategies  to  bridge  the  identified  gaps.  The  TA  also  aims  to  raise \nawareness of the potential impact of governance on their daily lives. The TA provides input into \nthe development of a Pacific governance strategy that is being formulated to guide ADB\u2019s \nassistance strategy for the region for 2004\u20132007. The TA provides grassroots information on \nthe community\u2019s understanding of governance concepts as they are practiced at the level to \ncomplement ADB\u2019s top-down governance assessments.            \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Good governance is key to effective economic and social development. Conversely, \npoor  governance  constrains  and  distorts  the  general  process  of  development  and  has  a \ndiscernable negative impact on the poorer and more vulnerable sections of society. Generally \nPDMCs are perceived as having weak governance institutions and processes. ADB recognizes \nthe essential role of governance in the development process, including, at a minimum, efficient, \neffective, and responsive government. The ADB assistance strategy for the Pacific in the past \ndecade has focused on assisting PDMCs to improve core government functions and public \nsector management, such as macroeconomic stability, public expenditure management, and \ncertain  public  administration  reforms.  The  recent  undertaking  of  country  governance \nassessments  in  several  PDMCs  is  aimed  at  broadening  ADB  assistance  to  include  other \naspects of governance that are important to ensure more targeted service delivery and more \ninclusive social development.  \n \n4.   A  preliminary  conclusion  from  the  Pacific  governance  assessments  is  that  the \neffectiveness of government service delivery and the degree that communities participate in the \ndevelopment process are related to the compatibility of governance structures with local culture \nand  institutions.  Modern  governance  structures,  based  largely  on  the  Westminster  model, \ncoexist alongside the traditional governance systems in many Pacific countries. For example, \nwhile the Constitution of the Fiji Islands recognizes the traditional chiefs, the role given to the \nGreat Council of Chiefs in the Fiji Islands is largely symbolic and ceremonial under normal \ncircumstances. Similarly, while village and district chiefs are expected to maintain law and order \nand look after the welfare of their community, little recognition is given to the chiefs in terms of \nresources or input into service delivery decisions. The communities are therefore far removed \n                                                 \n1  This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 June 2002.  ", "2 \nfrom resource allocation decisions, which are normally made at the national level through the \nMinistry of Fijian Affairs.   \n \n5.  Rural and island communities in many parts of the Pacific typically have little interaction \nwith or understanding of the national government and civic institutions adopted since national \nindependence. In addition, the long history and continued strength of subsistence economies \nwithin these communities leads to difficulties in \u201ctranslation\u201d from traditional interdependence \nstructures to modern government structures which are underpinned by an independent public \nservice and independent institutions. There is thus a need to (i) examine how the lack of \nconnection between modern and traditional governance structures affects development efforts \nof governments and external funding agencies in order to understand the impacts on local \ncommunities; and (ii) identify and test participatory processes for building local awareness of \ngovernance concepts, giving voice to local communities, and resolving conflicts that may arise \ndue to differences in modern and traditional governance structures (for example the role of \nwomen and youth in traditional customs vis-\u00e0-vis the modern concept of gender equality). In \naddition it is necessary to understand whether and how changes in the economic and social \nsituation since independence have affected the local community and its social fabric. Unless \nthese issues are understood and addressed through capacity building and education, political \nand social instability are likely to continue, jeopardizing economic development and constraining \nefforts to alleviate poverty. \n \n6.  The  Foundation  of  the  Peoples  of  the  South  Pacific  International  (FSPI)  Regional \nSecretariat, a regional nongovernmental organization with representation and operations in \nmany PDMCs, is well positioned to be involved in this task. The FSPI consulted with a large \nnumber of stakeholders regarding the current state of political instability in the region. The FSPI \nconcluded that the key to understanding the current state of governance in the region and \nopportunities for promoting good governance and equitable decision making are likely to be \nfound in analyzing and targeting this rural-nonurban context. The FSPI therefore initiated a 3 \nyear project titled Voices and Choices: Gardening Good Governance and Democracy in the \nPacific in early 2002. The project has received financial support from the United Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) and New Zealand Overseas Development \nAgency (now NZAID).  \n \n7.  The  first  phase  of  the  FSPI  project  involves  governance  mapping  activities  in \ncommunities  in  four  countries:  Fiji  Islands,  Kiribati,  Solomon  Islands,  and  Vanuatu.    This \nexercise will engage communities in analyzing their priority problems and linking these to issues \nof governance from a village perspective. It will assist local communities to identify effective \ntraditional/local forms of governance that may complement modern systems (and vice versa). \nThe project will help enable the communities to articulate their vision of society, community, and \nvalues, and how the traditional/local and national governance systems and institutions can \nimprove or hinder individual and community livelihood. Later phases of the FSPI project move \nthis process up to the national and regional levels, culminating in capacity building of civil \nsociety and development of materials for school curricula and rural communities on rights and \nobligations of citizens and leaders. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will directly select the FSPI as consultant for the governance mapping exercise \nfor this TA.  Governance mapping was the first phase of activities of the FSPI project (para. 7). ", "    3 \nFSPI was undertaking governance mapping in a number of countries in the first phase of the \nproject, and this will also be a key input to the development of the Pacific governance strategy. \nNo other organization has similar experience or could start the work quickly. The strategy will \nanalyze differences and similarities between the traditional and modern models of governance \nviewed from the perspective of village communities and how they may impact development \nefforts by governments and funding agencies. This understanding is essential in formulating \nstrategies and action plans that will build local awareness of governance concepts and practices \nthat may affect the communities, encourage community participation in the decision making \nprocess at the local level, and allow local communities to partake in any decision making \nprocess on service provision and delivery.     \n \n9.  The output of the TA is mainly a report with three parts: (i) a description of (a) the \ncommunity governance mapping process that identifies traditional forms of governance and \ntheir place in the current governance structures and practices of grassroots communities, (b) the \nunits of relationship including families and links with the wider society, (c) the resulting effects of \nthese relationships and hierarchy within the community in terms of power, authority, and who \nbenefits  and  who  does  not,  and  (d)  any  similarities  and  major  differences  across  sample \ncommunities within each country and across the four participating countries; (ii) identification of \nareas of complementarity and potential conflict between the two models in terms of concepts \nand practices in the country, and a description of current conflict management mechanisms in \nboth systems; and (iii) analysis of tools and mechanisms, from the village perspective, that may \nbe useful in reconciling/managing the differences and reinforcing the positive elements of the \nmodels in order to improve the relevance of the national and traditional governance institutions \nand  processes  to  grassroots  communities  (for  example  analyzing  the  appropriateness,  or \nrelevance, of the decentralization model being adopted in several Pacific countries as a means \nto bring decision making closer to the communities.) The report will be an important input to the \ndevelopment  of  practical  strategies  and  activities  that  can  be  implemented  to  improve \ngovernance in individual Pacific countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  As the TA will be a collaboration between ADB and the FSPI, the methodology used by \nFSPI  for  the  first  phase  of  their  project  is  adopted  for  this  TA.  The  major  activity  is  the \ngovernance mapping process in a number of communities in the target countries of Fiji Islands, \nKiribati, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. The FSPI project team is working with the University of \nthe South Pacific\u2019s School of Law to investigate how best to facilitate governance linkages \nbetween the communities and the modern government institutions. The FSPI network affiliates \nin the Pacific are familiar with and regularly use participatory learning and action tools and \nprocesses in their community work.  \n \n11.  The  mapping  exercise  will  gather  data  on  governance  pressure  points  within  the \nselected countries (for example land ownership, population pressures/urban drift, corruption, \nlack of community empowerment, lack of access to basic services) as well as traditional forms \nof governance (e.g. the Vanuatu and Kiribati approaches to consensus building) that have been \nless used in post colonial Pacific governments. This work will use participatory learning and \naction tools enabling local communities to analyze their societal structures (lines of authority, \ngender roles, etc.) and role of leaders in the community, and identify gender and youth related \nissues. Mapping will also identify knowledge and use of traditional and modern systems of \nproblem solving and decision making to identify gaps and the relative effectiveness of each \nsystem. \n ", "4 \n12.  The mapping exercise will enable communities to assess their own local institutional \nstructures and governance challenges (for example the chiefs vis-\u00e0-vis elected members of \nParliament), and identify effective mechanisms for promoting good governance and positive \ncitizen engagement. The TA will use data gathered in the mapping process to recommend \nstrategies to enhance community participation in political decision making processes relating to \ngovernment resource allocation and service delivery and assist in improving the governance \nenvironment in the Pacific. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $200,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Governance Cooperation Fund, supported by the Government of Canada. \nDetailed cost estimates and financing are provided in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Suva-based FSPI will be directly \nselected as consultant. The project team leader is a full-time staff of FSPI and will direct the \nefforts of the teams in the four countries where communities agree to participate. Community \nmapping activities will be facilitated and coordinated by staff of FSPI affiliate organizations \nactive in the selected countries. Progress reports and the final report to ADB will be prepared by \nthe project team leader. Quality assurance of the methodology of community mapping and PLA \ntools, and analytical assessment of the results will be provided by FSPI partners in this project, \nincluding  the  Law  School  of  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific;  the  State,  Society  and \nGovernance  in  Melanesia  Centre  of  the  Australian  National  University,  Australia;  and  the \nRegional Rights and Resources Team.     \n \n15.  The TA will commence in January 2003 and is expected to be completed by June 2003.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \n \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Canada through the Governance Cooperation Fund for \nAssessing Community Perspectives on Governance in the Pacific, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n ", " \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance    Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms \nIndicators/Targets  and Risks \n \n   \nGoal       \nBetter understanding of   Number of communities     \ntraditional and modern  participating in the mapping \ngovernance arrangements  exercise. \nfrom the perspective of rural   \nand nonurban communities.
