INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the capacity of green \nurban planning to underpin livable cities and sustainable urban development. The TA will support \ncapacity building primarily through research and knowledge sharing of international best practices \non urban planning and building codes. The TA will analyze international lessons relevant to \nMongolia\u2019s extreme weather, prepare recommendations to update urban planning regulations and \ncodes, and test the recommendations on local master plans. Improving the regulatory framework \non urban planning will enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of an urban planning process \nthat embraces economic, social, and environmental considerations.1 \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with the country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020 of \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).2 It will support the Government of Mongolia\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment Vision 2030 and, ultimately, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 (make \ncities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable) and 13 (strengthen \nresilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In  1950,  only  20%  of  Mongolians  lived  in  urban  areas.  Since  then,  Mongolia  has \nexperienced rapid rural\u2013urban migration, especially after it made the transition from central \nplanning to a market-based economy in 1991. In 2018, the urban population represents 70% of \nthe country\u2019s 3 million inhabitants (the average urbanization ratio in Asia is 50%). Except for the \ncities of Darkhan and Erdenet (each with about 80,000 people), most of the aimag (province) \ncapitals and towns have a population of less than 25,000. Rural\u2013urban migration has formed \nsubstandard peri-urban settlements around cities, called ger (traditional tent) areas, which have \nspread and expanded through successive migration waves. Migration has been driven by the loss \nof millions of livestock because of extreme weather events resulting in droughts and severe winter \nconditions  (dzuds)  and  general  loss  of  livestock  productivity  caused  by  poor  pasture \nmanagement, overgrazing, and poor veterinary services. \n \n4.  Since families have moved to larger urban centers, like Ulaanbaatar, aimag centers, and \nother soums (subdistricts), the provision of adequate urban services has lagged. The outdated \nurban planning system is not conducive to the uptake and introduction of more inclusive city \nplanning models, innovative and more sustainable technologies, and the application of greener \nconstruction methods. Residents of ger areas (i) use inefficient individual stoves to burn low-\nquality coal and live in low energy-efficient shelters, making ger areas a hot spot for carbon dioxide \nand other air pollution emissions; (ii) rely on open pit latrines, which create severe soil pollution \nimpacting residents\u2019 health especially when temperatures rise; and (iii) have limited access to \nwater supplied by water kiosks. Ger areas are highly prone to flooding in summer (June to August) \nbecause of their extensive system of muddy roads and the lack of a buffer zone and drains. \n \n5.  In its Sustainable Development Vision 2030, the Government of Mongolia pledged to \nprovide greater independence to urban areas and settlements; build roads, transportation, and \nengineering infrastructure; create a healthy, safe, and comfortable living environment for citizens; \n                                                \n1  Formerly known as Green Urban Development Planning, the concept was approved on 4 January 2018. The Ministry \nof Construction and Urban Development (MCUD) and ADB agreed in a memorandum of understanding to revise the \ntitle to Green Urban Planning. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 \nJanuary 2018. \n2  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u20132020\u2014Sustaining Inclusive Growth in a Period of \nEconomic Difficulty. Manila. \n ", "2 \nand improve urban planning in line with world-class green development models. Under this \nobjective, the government committed to develop the green development standards for urban \ndevelopment,  build  infrastructure  that  meets  the  green  development  model,  redevelop \nUlaanbaatar and other urban areas and settlements, and reduce heat loss in buildings by 20%.3 \n \n6.  This objective cannot be achieved with the current urban planning codes, norms, and \nstandards, which were last updated in 2004. These codes are linked to a development strategy \nthat was striving to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (i.e., economic development and \npoverty reduction) without emphasizing green development as laid out in the SDGs, especially \nSDG 11 and SDG 13. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) urban planning in line with world-class \ngreen development models improved; and (ii) inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and \nhuman settlements achieved (footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: green urban \nplanning for aimag centers in Mongolia strengthened.4 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Good practices for green urban planning reviewed. International good \npractices for green urban planning, emphasizing aspects that are related to the harsh climate in \nMongolia, will be reviewed and summarized through (i) a literature review of green urban planning \ncodes suitable for Mongolia\u2019s climate; and (ii) an international roundtable discussion on green \nurban planning, which will also serve as capacity building for relevant agencies and offices. \n \n9.  Output  2:  Green  urban  planning  process  updated.  This  output  will  have  two \ncomponents: (i) an assessment of priority regulations and guidelines that would require revisions; \nand (ii) the preparation of the actual recommendations and/or updated documents (planning \ncodes, norms, and standards) that would facilitate the transition to a greener urban planning \nprocess. The update will be based on the experiences and feedback compiled under output 1. A \ndigital publication of the resulting recommendations and updated regulations will be shared with \nthe government for discussion. \n \n10.  Output 3: Green urban plans prepared and disseminated. This output will demonstrate \nthe application of the updated and greener codes and regulations, mindful of environmental \nimpacts, to an existing urban development master plan. It is envisaged that the TA will support \nthe preparation of plans for one aimag center and 1\u20133 soums. The output has three components: \n(i) drafting the green urban development plans, (ii) conducting consultation workshops to present \nand discuss the draft plans, and (iii) preparing final recommendations and awareness-raising \nmaterials to promote green urban development planning for urban centers in Mongolia.5 \n \n                                                \n3  State Great Khural. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030. Ulaanbaatar; and United Nations. 2015. \nSustainable Development Goals. www.sustainabledevelopment.un.org. \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n5  The selection of the aimag centers and soums will ensure that ADB and the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency\u2019s upcoming TA on Human Settlement Development Program and/or investment are targeted as much as \npossible to the same localities to amplify synergies and outcomes. \n ", "3 \n11.  The TA outputs will support the overall upgrading of the national capacity and regulatory \nframework on urban planning that is more conducive to the introduction and uptake of more \ninclusive city planning models, innovative and more sustainable technologies, and the application \nof greener construction methods that can make Mongolian cities more livable. The TA will provide \ncritical support in upgrading the core planning codes for Mongolian cities. It will apply the first \ngreen  urban  planning  in  cities  and centers\u2014other  than the capital  city\u2014to facilitate  urban \ndevelopment models, which distribute population and productivity evenly in the country while \nmaximizing the use of and preserving local natural resources. The TA will build on lessons learned \nfrom ADB experience.6 \n \n12.  Given its capacity-building nature, the TA approach is appropriate for delivering targeted \noutputs under ADB\u2019s guidance and employing expert knowledge from ADB. The TA modality \nallows ADB the degree of administrative and technical supervision needed for national TA. \nLessons learned from the TA, which will be disseminated through seminars and knowledge \nbriefings, can be replicated in other similar ADB central western members.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $620,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The following  are  ineligible  expenditures: (i)  vehicle  purchases, (ii) salaries for  civil \nservants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering design, \n(vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or \nNegative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.7  \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, data and information, office supplies, secretarial assistance, in-city transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions valued at $20,000.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will administer the TA. \n \n17.  The executing and implementing  agency, the Urban Development and Land Affairs \nDepartment under the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD), is responsible \nfor preparing the legal framework for urban planning, including laws on urban development, land \nmanagement,  and  construction.  Green  master  planning  will  be  embedded  in  the  national \nregulations and building codes, which will inform future development countrywide when they are \napproved. The MCUD\u2019s implementation capacity was assessed adequate, and it will benefit from \nsharing international best practices and other capacity-building opportunities to be provided under \nthis TA as well as other projects being processed and implemented in ADB. \n \n18.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the following table. \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2017.
