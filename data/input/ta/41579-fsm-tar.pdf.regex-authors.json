The country operations business plan 2007\u20132009 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  (FSM)  includes  the  development  of  two  technical \nassistance (TA) projects: Develop a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework; and Managing for \nDevelopment Results\u2014Enhancing the Accountability of Government.1 The Government of FSM \nand  the  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Department  have  agreed  to  expedite  Managing  for  Development \nResults\u2014Enhancing  the  Accountability  of  Government,  which  was  previously  planned  for \nimplementation in 2009 and has since been renamed Strengthening Public Sector Performance. \nThe TA includes the original concepts discussed during negotiations for the country operations \nbusiness  plan  to  improve  public  sector  capacity  to  manage  for  results  and  increase  the \naccountability of the public sector for its performance in delivering services to the people of FSM. \n \n2.  A Fact-Finding Mission visited FSM from 11 to 15 August 2008. An understanding was \nreached on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, and outline of the general \nterms of reference for the TA.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Since its independence in 1986, FSM has received relatively high levels of external \nassistance, predominantly from the United States (US) under the Compacts of Free Association. \nHowever, FSM\u2019s economy remains undeveloped and heavily dependent on the public sector \n(overall public expenditure is equivalent to about 60% of gross domestic product [GDP]), with \nlimited private sector activity and a narrow export base. On a per capita basis, GDP was \nestimated at $1,952 in fiscal year (FY) 2006. \n \n4.  FSM has four states and one national government. Each state is responsible for the \ndelivery of many traditional public sector services. A state\u2019s public sector finances are derived \nfrom (i) state taxes; (ii) a proportion of national revenue as stipulated in the constitution; and (iii) \nbudget support from the Compact of Free Association with the US, which also predetermines \nfunding for each state government. Ninety percent of total public sector revenues are distributed \nto the state governments. With five independent governments (four state level and one national), \nthere is a very large public sector with a proportionately-low and poorly-educated population \nbase on which to draw its personnel. FSM has four departments of education, servicing 35,000 \nstudents in 265 schools. In language arts, 61% of students achieve below basic educational \nrequirements. In mathematics, the rate of underachievement is 87%.3  \n \n5.  As with other Pacific island economies, traditional attitudes tend to interfere with the \nobjective delivery of public services. Public sector employment tends to be viewed as a social \nsafety  net  for  Micronesian  families.  Work  performance  and  productivity  are  not  as  highly \nprioritized as family and traditional responsibilities, which results in low work attendance rates \nand low productivity. On average across the four states, public sector wages and salaries \nconstitute 46% of total government expenditure.4  With the exception of financial institutions, \npublic sector wages are far higher than those in the private sector. Any fiscal reductions tend to \nresult in the reduction of public sector work hours rather than a reduction in the number of public \nservants.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan (2007\u20132009): Federated States of Micronesia. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB\u2019s website on 17 October 2008. \n3  Government of the Federated States of Micronesia. 2007. JEMCO 20 Indicators Report 2007. Pohnpei. \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2007. Federated States of Micronesia: 2006 Article IV Consultation\u2014Staff Report. \nWashington, DC. ", "2 \n \n6.  The work force\u2019s poor education, FSM\u2019s dependency on relatively high external aid flows, \nrelatively  large  public  sector  wages  and  salaries,  and  cultural  norms  have  contributed  to \ninefficiencies in public sector service delivery. These inefficiencies include: (i) limited financial \nresponsibility, (ii) limited monitoring of performance, (iii) over-reliance on the public sector for \neconomic stability, (iv) substitution of foreign assistance for raising domestic revenues, and (v) \nlimited demand for policy change. Nonetheless, there are public sector staff in all states and the \nnational Government who are highly skilled and committed to providing high-quality public \nservices. Their commitment and actions, however, tend to be undermined by adherence to \ntraditional obligations for decision making and by direct intervention from the legislature that \nweaken efforts by the executive branch to improve public sector performance.  \n \n7.  Recent public consultations confirm that residents in many states feel disenfranchised by \ntheir governments.5 Despite the political will to meet public expectations and the hard work by \nsome public servants, there are very few mechanisms in most states for the public to engage \nwith their state governments, obtain information on public sector performance, and effectively \nhold them accountable for performance. The public consultations clearly articulated the demand \nfor better information on public sector activities and performance. \n \n8.  Factors that facilitate good public sector performance in the delivery of services include: \n(i) clear vision, goals, and objectives; (ii) realistic levels of resources to achieve these objectives; \n(iii) information to measure performance against objectives; (iv) leadership and management \ndriving an outcome-based focus; (v) capable and competent staff delivering public services; and \n(vi) good coordination within government and with external stakeholders, including the public. \n \n9.  The Government highlights the importance of improving public sector management as \none of six strategic components in its Strategic Development Plan 2004\u20132023.6 Considerable \ninternational development partner support has been provided for capacity building, processes \nimprovement, infrastructure development, and the substitution of service delivery. Despite a \nwide range of external assistance to strengthen public service delivery and additional assistance \nprovided by the national Government to state governments, only marginal improvements have \nbeen achieved.7 The assistance provided by ADB and others has been necessary to support \ntechnical and skill shortages in FSM, although the improvements have not been sustainable. \nThere remain cultural and political impediments to effectively managing the performance of \npublic sector staff and negotiating change with traditional leaders. \n \n10.  To effect a cultural change within the public service, it is proposed that the TA identify \ncurrent and potential future members of the legislature, public sector, and civil society who are \nwilling and able to act as agents for change. These individuals will be provided with skills \ntraining and mentoring to manage for outcomes, negotiate change, and foster a performance \nculture within their respective areas of influence and expertise. Sustainable change can only be \nachieved by increasing the cadre of people trying to improve outcomes and create change \nwithin  the  public  sector.  The  selection  of  TA  participants  will  be  undertaken  through  a \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Civil Society Participation in Development. Manila (TA 6319-\nREG, approved on 28 April, for $565,000). Public consultations to identify development priorities were conducted \nunder this TA. Increased public information and public awareness was recorded as the number one priority of \npublic consultations in all four states. \n6  Government of the Federated States of Micronesia in conjunction with ADB. 2003.

", "3 \ncombination of self nomination and recommendations by relevant stakeholders. The program of \nin-country assistance and training support will be developed following a needs assessment and \nconsideration of different advisory and training approaches. The TA will be piloted in one state \nduring phase 1 and rolled out to other states in phase 2, which will be dependent on an \nevaluation and available funds.8 \n \n11.  Responding to public demand for increased access to information about the issues \nbefore the legislature and on the performance of the public sector, the TA will support public \ninformation dissemination and public awareness capacity building in the pilot state. By fostering \npublic information dissemination and raising awareness of public sector performance, the public \nwill have a more informed and realistic set of expectations of public sector performance. This \nwill  facilitate  debate  on  policy  development  and  enhance  greater  community  support  and \nownership of state-level development outcomes. Providing the public with information and tools \nto hold their governments more accountable should help foster a culture of performance results \nwithin the public sector. Through this process, it is also expected that additional change agents \nwill emerge. Leaders and managers can anticipate greater support from the community to \nundertake difficult decisions that will improve public sector performance. While strengthening \ndemand  for  improved  public  sector  performance,  by  facilitating  increased  civil  society \nparticipation, the TA will need to ensure agreement between the pilot state and civil society \nrepresentatives on the manner in which this participation can be most effective. \n \n12.  Through a steering committee, the TA will ensure its rolling design complements existing \nand  future  international  development  partner  projects.  For  example,  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  plans  to  conduct  a  legislative  needs  analysis  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment, the findings of which may be pertinent in the TA pilot state. The TA will take into \nconsideration other applicable leadership programs9 and learn from the experiences of previous \nADB programs.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be the improved delivery of state level public services through \nenhanced performance-oriented public sector operations. The TA outcome will be the improved \ndelivery of performance-based operational plans and budgets within some state government \ndepartments.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  Change processes take time to gain momentum, and require flexible mechanisms to \nrespond to emerging needs and collaboration by all participants. It is proposed that the TA be \ndelivered  through  a  rolling  design  to  ensure  close  consultation  and  public  participation  in \nongoing  design  and  implementation,  as  well  as  responsiveness  to  political  and  attitudinal \nchanges with respect to these sensitive matters. To support the achievement of the impacts and \noutcome  described  in  para.  13,  the  TA  will  comprise  three  components  focusing  on  the \nlegislature,  public  sector  managers,  and  public  awareness.  These  components  are:  (i) \n                                                 \n8  The state of Chuuk was recommended to be the pilot state during the Fact-Finding Mission. \n9  For example, the Graduate School, United States Department of Agriculture, conducts an Executive Leadership \nDevelopment Program, which is open to Micronesians. \n10 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Leadership Enhancement and Advancement Program. Manila (TA 6222-\nREG, approved on 23 December). \n ", "4 \npreparation and implementation of a good governance advisory program for state legislatures; \n(ii)  greater  adherence  to  public  sector  regulations  through  more  accountable  management \npractices;  and  (iii)  raising  community  awareness  of,  and  engagement  with,  public  sector \nperformance.  \n \n15.  The  output  of  the  first  component  will  be  a  good  governance  and  policy  advisory \nprogram for implementation by the state legislatures. The program will focus on improving \naccountability and transparency in the legislative decision-making processes. Activities in this \ncomponent will comprise: \n \n(i)  consulting with political leaders about their expectations and recommendations \nfor a governance and policy strengthening program; \n(ii)  developing  and  implementing  a  public  outreach  program  to  disseminate \ninformation on legislative discussions and debates; and \n(iii)  developing  and  implementing  a  process  to  improve  the  passage  of  policies \nthrough the legislature. \n \n16.  The output of the second component will include implementation of a state public sector \nsenior  management  strengthening  program.  The  program  will  focus  on  current  and  future \nchange agents within senior management or leadership positions in the states\u2019 public sectors. \nThe focus will be on those with the potential to improve performance within the public sector. \nActivities in this component will comprise: \n \n(i)  consulting with political leaders and senior officials on their expectations and \nrecommendations for the training program; \n(ii)  establishing criteria for screening candidates and identifying candidates for the \nprogram; and \n(iii)  developing a modular, intermittent training program to strengthen core skills in \nperformance management and negotiation. \n \n17.  The output of the third component will be the implementation of a public information and \nawareness program. The program will focus on public service operations and performance in \neach state. Activities in this component will comprise: \n \n(i)  developing approaches to public information dissemination and public awareness \ncampaigns that are sensitive to the political economy of each state; \n(ii)  establishing  a  public  information  and  awareness  campaign  on  public  sector \nperformance; and \n(iii)  strengthening the ability of existing information providers, such as radio stations, \nto engage the public through the information and awareness campaign. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $800,000 equivalent. Of this, $750,000 \nequivalent  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government of FSM will finance the remaining $50,000 equivalent \nthrough  the  in-kind  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodations,  and  local \ncommunications support. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  It is proposed that the FSM\u2019s Office of the Statistics, Budget Management, Overseas \nDevelopment Assistance and Compact Management (SBOC) act as the Executing Agency, \nwhile the implementing agencies will be the Office of Governor for each state. A steering \ncommittee  will  be  formed  and  chaired  by  a  representative  of  SBOC,  and  will  include \nrepresentatives from the pilot state\u2019s legislature, Office of the Governor, public sector, and civil \nsociety. Once key change agents have been identified, a representative of the target group for \nmanagement strengthening will be included in the steering committee.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented intermittently over a 60-month period, starting in March \n2009  and  ending  in  February  2014.  The  TA  will  finance  up  to  18.5  person-months  of \ninternational  and  up  to  40  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  proposed \nconsultants will comprise the following: (i) public sector management specialist/team leader \n(international, 10 person-months, intermittent); (ii) public sector training specialist (international, \n3  person-months,  intermittent);  (iii)  governance  specialist  (international,  2  person-months, \nintermittent);  (iv)  communications  specialist  (international,  1  person-month,  intermittent);  (v) \npublic  financial  management  specialist  (international,  0.5  person-month,  intermittent);  (vi) \ncommunications advisor (national, 6 person-months, intermittent); and (vii) national adviser \n(national,  24  person-months,  part-time).  Unallocated  international  and  national  consultancy \nservices  (international  specialist,  2  person-months,  intermittent;  and/or  additional  national \nadvisers, 10 person-months, intermittent) may be required as determined during the design \nstage of the reform program. \n \n21.  ADB will engage a team of consultants through a firm based on a simplified technical \nproposal under the quality- and cost-based selection process. The consultants will be engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Appendix 3 includes the outline terms of reference. Equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and \nturned over to the Ministry of Finance on completion of the TA. Administration of all seminars, \ntrainings, and workshops will be managed by the successful consulting firm. \n \n22.  An inception report will be prepared for ADB by the team leader within 5 weeks of the \nstart of field activities. Annual progress reports will be produced as well. A draft final report will \nbe provided within 3 months prior to the end of the TA. The final report is to be submitted within \n1 month of receiving ADB comments on the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  for  Strengthening  Public  Sector \nPerformance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and/or \nDesign  Performance Targets  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Mechanismsa  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved delivery of  Demonstrated  Annual performance- Broad support from \nstate-level public  improvements in states\u2019  based budget reports  society and political \nservices through  management,  and  leadership to adapt and \nenhanced  governance, and policy  Joint Economic  adopt means to support \nperformance-  development processes  Management  improved public services \noriented public sector  consistent with  Committee (JEMCO)  as opposed to political \noperations  international good  reports  allegiances \npractices     \nInternational Monetary  Risk \nFund Article IV, Asian  There is a change of \nDevelopment Bank  leadership during \n(ADB), and other  implementation \nreports \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved delivery of  Three selected  Annual audit reports,   General levels of public \nperformance-based  departments\u2019 operational  budget reports,   education support the \noperational plans and  and budget plans  annual performance  required levels of \nbudgets within some  delivered on time  budget reports, and  understanding \nstate government    JEMCO reports   \ndepartments      Dissemination can be \n  Increased public  Public survey  tailored to civil society \n  perception of Government    education levels \naccountability and   \nresponsiveness.
