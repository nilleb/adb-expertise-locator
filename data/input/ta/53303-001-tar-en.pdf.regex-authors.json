INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Implemented under the overall guidance of the United Nations Statistical Commission \n(UNSC), the International Comparison Program (ICP) is the world\u2019s largest statistical initiative. It \naims  to  produce  globally  comparable  measures  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  its \ncomponents (household consumption expenditure, government consumption expenditure, gross \nfixed capital formation, and imports and exports) based on purchasing power parities (PPPs) for \neconomies  across  the  world.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  through  its  Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD), has been the regional implementing \nagency (RIA) of the ICP for Asia and the Pacific since 2003.1 For the 2005 and 2011 ICP \nbenchmark rounds, ADB added value through successful coordination and producing regionally \ncomparable PPPs required for estimating global PPPs.2 For the ongoing 2017 ICP, ADB\u2019s Office \nof the Chief Economist and Director General\u2014Statistics and Data Innovation Unit (EROD-SDI, \nERCD) is the RIA for 22 participating economies.3 For the 2020 ICP cycle, which begins globally \nin January 2020, ADB will provide overall management, coordinate regional data collection in \nparticipating economies through the national implementing agencies (NIAs), validate and analyze \ndata, and calculate the Asia and Pacific regional PPPs. The knowledge and support technical \nassistance (TA) aims to support ADB\u2019s role as the RIA for the 2020 ICP in Asia and the Pacific to \nproduce PPPs for 2020 and to undertake related statistical capacity-building initiatives. \n \n2.  The TA is part of the approved 2019 Work Plan of the ERCD and was endorsed as a \ncorporate priority TA.4 It is linked to the Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data \nthrough Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target 17.19, which aims to \u201cbuild on existing \ninitiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement \nGDP, and support statistical capacity building in developing countries.\u201d5 The TA is aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which envisions ADB\u2019s increasing role as a knowledge institution in the \nregion and in expanding knowledge partnerships and knowledge dissemination.6 \n \n \n1  The ICP is a global partnership among national statistics offices (NSOs), the RIAs, and the World Bank, all sharing \nthe responsibilities in the implementation process. More than 175 economies are participating in the ongoing 2017 \nICP cycle. The following agencies act as current RIAs and will continue to play their roles for the 2020 ICP cycle: the \nAfrican Development Bank for Africa, ADB for Asia and the Pacific, The Interstate Statistical Committee of the \nCommonwealth of Independent States for Commonwealth of Independent States, the Economic Commission for \nLatin America and the Caribbean for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Economic Commission for West Asia for \nWest Asia, The Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) for Euro area and OECD economies. The UNSC established an ICP Governing \nBoard with members from 11 economies, RIAs, the World Bank, the United Nations Statistics Division, and the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to oversee the implementation of the global program. \n2  ADB. 2005.

Technical Assistance for \n2017 International Comparison Program for Asia and the Pacific. Manila (TA 9238-REG).The 22 participating \neconomies in the 2017 ICP are Bangladesh; Bhutan; Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; the People\u2019s Republic of China; \nFiji; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; the Maldives; Mongolia; \nMyanmar; Nepal; Pakistan; the Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. The same \n22 economies are expected to participate in the 2020 ICP cycle under the TA. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 October 2019. \n5  United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for SDGs.

Stakeholders  are  increasingly  demanding  more  frequent  PPP-based  comparable \nmeasures of economic output that are free of price and exchange rate distortions. The PPPs \nobtained through the ICP are used for direct comparisons of indicators of well-being such as per \ncapita GDP or expenditures, per capita on health, education, and housing, among others, and \nthus allow for real comparisons of price levels and standards of living and well-being across \neconomies.  The  PPPs  for  household  consumption  are  the  main  inputs  for  deriving  the \ninternational poverty line and updating the poverty headcounts used to monitor targets on global \nand regional poverty associated with the SDG agenda. Currently, the international poverty line, \nset at $1.90 per day, is based on the 2011 ICP PPPs. Apart from the use of the PPPs to monitor \npoverty, other PPP-based indicators in the SDG framework help monitor income inequality, \nenergy intensity, labor productivity, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP, etc. ADB\u2019s policy \npaper ADB Corporate Results Framework, 2019\u20132024 is aligned with the SDG agenda and \nincludes  indicators  that  track  development  progress  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  whose \nmeasurement depends on PPPs.7 Other examples of international organizations that use PPPs \ninclude  the  Human  Development  Index  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme, \nassessment of per capita expenditures in education by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, \nand Cultural Organization, and calculation of special drawing rights and voting power of member \ncountries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) formula that includes GDP in PPP terms, \namong  other  variables.  Some  economies  adopt  ICP  principles  and  methods  to  produce \nsubnational PPPs to compare standards of living across regions within an economy. \n \n4.  Until recently, the ICP was implemented at irregular benchmark years, with the last four \nrounds  in  1993,  2005,  2011,  and  2017.  PPP  estimates  for  non-benchmark  years  rely  on \nextrapolation techniques. Past lessons suggest that extrapolating PPPs for the years between \nbenchmarks, especially when there is a long gap, has been problematic and leads to large \ndifferences between extrapolated PPPs and PPPs from the new benchmark. The extrapolation \napproach implicitly assumes that internationally comparable price indexes evolve identically with \nthe national price indexes used for extrapolation. Comparability problems also arise because of \nmethodological improvements in computing PPPs across ICP benchmark years. Consequently, \nthe consistency between spatial and temporal indexes cannot be maintained over long periods, \nleading to major revisions in GDP expressed in PPP terms when ICP benchmark results become \navailable. \n \n5.  To address these inconsistencies, the UNSC endorsed the ICP global comparisons as a \npermanent element of the global statistical work program in March 2016. The UNSC also \nendorsed a shortened interval of 3 years between ICP benchmark rounds, starting in 2017, to \nprovide direct price comparisons more frequently. The ICP is a multilateral exercise implemented \nwith  the  collaborative  participation  of  national  statistical  agencies,  regional  agencies,  and \ninternational development partners, who share the responsibility to collect, validate, and process \ndata and estimate PPPs and other economic aggregates. This governance framework, with actors \nat national, regional, and global levels, makes the ICP a unique global statistical initiative and \nsuccessfully led to the implementation of the 2005, 2011, and ongoing 2017 ICP rounds. \n \n6.  The ICP relies on the national statistics offices (NSOs) in each economy to serve as the \nNIAs. The NIAs collect prices of relevant items from a catalogue of more than a thousand \ncomparable items (goods and services) that form part of the final expenditures in the GDP. The \nNSOs conduct ICP price surveys in addition to their regular price surveys for compiling consumer \nprice indexes (CPIs). The items in the ICP and CPI baskets overlap only partially, so ICP price \ncollection entails additional work for NSOs. Many NSOs lack adequate resources for ICP activities, \n \n7  ADB. 2019. ADB Corporate Results Framework, 2019\u20132024. Manila. \n ", "3 \nwhich do not get same priority as CPI price surveys. Because the economies in the Asia and \nPacific region have very diverse backgrounds and capacities, coordinating regional activities is \ncomplex  and  challenging,  requiring  TA  and  capacity-building  support  to  ensure  uniform \ncompliance with the strict standards and protocols of ICP price surveys, especially in economies \nwith weak statistical capacities and/or those with resource constraints. PPP computation also \nrequires detailed disaggregation of GDP expenditures following ICP classification and the United \nNations System of National Accounts 2008, which are used as weights in aggregating PPPs at \nhigher levels. Integrating ICP and CPI price collection technically and operationally will help \nreduce the burden on limited NSO resources. With ICP becoming a regular activity, integrating \nCPI and ICP is likely to get more attention in coming years, despite the greater challenges in \nimplementing it. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: utilization of comparable macroeconomic \nstatistics in policy making and research enhanced.8 The TA will have the following outcome: \ncomparability of macroeconomic aggregates for ADB member economies in Asia and the Pacific \nimproved.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: International Comparison Program regional governance framework for \nAsia and the Pacific established. The regional governance framework for the 2020 ICP will \nfollow the successful framework of earlier ICP rounds: (i) participating ADB member economies \nwill sign a no-objection letter to participate in the TA, designating their NSOs or the agency \nresponsible for price statistics or national accounts statistics as the NIAs to implement national \nlevel price activities; and (ii) a regional advisory board (RAB), which comprises NIA heads of \nselect participating ADB member economies, ADB, and regional and international organizations \nand institutions, will endorse the policies and protocols for calculating regional PPPs for the 2020 \nICP for Asia and the Pacific.10 As the RIA, ADB will be a member in the ICP Governing Board and \nInteragency Coordination Group and collaborate with the ICP Global Office at the World Bank for \nICP  implementation  conforming  to  the  standard  concepts  and  methodology  of  this  global \nexercise.11 \n \n9.  Output 2: International Comparison Program survey tools developed and price \nsurveys conducted. The TA will develop ICP survey data tools required for ICP implementation \nand conduct price surveys with:  \n(i)  ICP 2020 product catalogs with structured product descriptions for household \ngoods  and  services  (including  dwelling  services)  to  collect  nationally \nrepresentative prices of household consumption, items of construction inputs \n \n8  Defined by TA. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The numerical targets of the outcome and outputs are defined \nwith reference to 2020 ICP, many of which are similar to the 2017 ICP requirements.  \n10 Similar to the arrangements in the 2005, 2011, and 2017 ICP rounds, a framework of partnership between ADB and \nNIAs of participating ADB member economies will be prepared. The framework of partnership is a nonlegal document \nthat outlines the roles and responsibilities of ADB and NIAs in completing project activities as well as schedule of key \nmilestones, and data access. No activity will be financed in any participating ADB member economy unless a no-\nobjection letter is obtained from the ADB member economy government. \n11 The ICP Governing Board is a strategic body that tackles strategy, funding, political support, and outreach issues; \nand endorses the policies and protocols to which the regional and global PPP calculation will adhere to. The ICP \nInteragency Coordination Group is a coordinating body, which collaborates on establishing global timetables and \nwork plans; develops common standards, methods, and protocols; and cooperatively prepares operational materials. \n ", "4 \n(materials, rental equipment, and labor), items of machinery and equipment for \nprices of products of capital formation, and government compensation data for \nprices of government services;  \n(ii)  technical guidelines and operations manuals for NIAs to uniformly implement \nsurvey design and ICP national price collection surveys;  \n(iii)  new web-based user-friendly software tools for NIAs to enter, validate and process \ndata and analyze of price data; and  \n(iv)  price  collection  surveys  of  household  items  and  specialized  surveys  of  non-\nhousehold items completed with price data collected, validated, and prepared for \nfurther processing and analysis in all participating ADB member economies.  \nThe TA will apply lessons and NIA feedback from the 2017 ICP implementation to further improve \nICP survey tools for collecting prices of comparable products across economies; operational \nguidelines and product catalogs will provide additional explanations and illustrations to uniformly \nand correctly identify products to be priced by participating ADB member economies. \n \n10.  Output 3: International Comparison Program knowledge products delivered and \ndisseminated. The TA will produce the following knowledge products and services:  \n(i)  datasets of validated annual national average ICP item prices, regional PPPs, and \nreal GDP expenditures for each participating economy, disaggregated by 155 \nbasic headings and at higher level aggregates for 22 ADB member economies \nexpected to participate in the 2020 ICP cycle under ADB\u2019s TA;12 \n(ii)  a final regional report, titled \u201c2020 International Comparison Program for Asia and \nthe Pacific: Purchasing Power Parities and Real Expenditures,\u201d that will include \nconceptual, methodological, and operational aspects of ICP implementation, and \n2020 ICP regional results with PPPs and PPP-based estimates of GDP and its \ncomponents;  \n(iii)  methodological research on enhanced uses of PPPs at the national level (such as \nsubnational  PPP  compilation),  improving  technical  and  operational  synergies \nbetween  CPI  and  ICP,  adopting  the  rolling  survey  approach  in  the  region, \ncontinued improvements in data sources and methodology to estimate PPPs, and \nnational accounts valuation of comparison resistant areas such as housing;13 and  \n(iv)  training modules on ICP\u2019s technical and operational aspects for NIA staff. \n \n11.  Output  4:  Statistical  capacity  of  participating  national  implementing  agencies \ndeveloped and strengthened. Because of the ICP\u2019s permanent status and lessons from the \n2017 ICP, continued efforts to build the capacity of NIA staff are crucial to sustainably implement \nthe ICP in participating ADB member economies. To build NIA capacity, the TA will conduct  \n(i)  periodic regional workshops and workshops in participating economies on (a) \nconcepts, methods, and classifications of ICP and related price statistics; and (b) \ncollection, field operations, validation and compilation of ICP data, using ICP tools \ndeveloped by ADB to train NIA staff of participating ADB member economies;  \n(ii)  technical and knowledge-sharing regional workshops on the theory and processes \nunderlying international comparisons for compiling and producing subnational \n \n12 The regional PPPs and other relevant data will be provided by ADB (and all other RIAs) to the World Bank (the global \ncoordinator of ICP) to link results across regions and estimate global PPPs and PPP-based macroeconomic \nindicators for the 2020 ICP cycle. Access to ICP data is governed by the ICP Data Access and Archiving Policy \napproved by the ICP Governing Board and allows researchers to request data permissible under the policy. It may \nalso be noted that while the ICP produces benchmark PPPs for GDP and several components of GDP, the World \nBank\u2019s World Development Indicators uses the ICP benchmark results to extrapolate PPPs for headline indicators \nof GDP and household final consumption expenditure for the non-benchmark years. \n13 Currently, the rolling survey approach for calculation of PPPs is implemented in the OECD-Eurostat comparisons. \nThis approach divides price surveys over a 3-year period rather than collecting prices for all surveys in 1 single year. \n ", "5 \nPPPs, which will invite economies that have successfully advanced in applying ICP \nmethods to estimate subnational PPPs and achieving CPI\u2013ICP integration to share \ntheir experience and methods with other economies; and  \n(iii)  regional workshops and workshops in participating economies for improving GDP \nexpenditure side estimates at various disaggregation levels by adopting the United \nNations System of National Accounts 2008 recommendations and framework.  \nNeed-based training in participating economies will supplement regional training, especially for \neconomies with weaker capacity. The TA will conduct demand-based capacity building for \neconomies with higher capacity interested in national ICP applications such as subnational PPP \ncompilation.14 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000,15 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6 and TASF Others). The key expenditure items are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA through EROD-SDI, ERCD as the executing agency and will \nserve as the RIA of the ICP in Asia and the Pacific, while the NSOs or identified government \nagencies in the participating ADB member economies will be the NIAs. EROD-SDI will be \nresponsible for overall management of the TA including (i) recruiting consultants; (ii) procuring \ngoods  and  services;  (iii)  collecting  and  analyzing  regional  data  and  calculating  PPPs;  (iv) \nconducting regional workshops and trainings in participating economies; and (v) working closely \nwith relevant ADB departments.16 The TA activities will be implemented from December 2019 to \nDecember 2023. \n \n14.  The NIAs in each participating ADB member economy will conduct price surveys in \naccordance with appropriate sampling designs to collect nationally representative prices of \navailable ICP items.17 As in the 2005, 2011, and 2017 ICP TA projects, the Advance Payment \nFacility (APF) will provide limited seed funds to the NIAs, following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), to supplement the costs of \nimplementing ICP activities at the national level, strengthen ICP infrastructure, and build capacity \nat the national levels.18 The seed funds will also support expenditures in procuring equipment \n \n14 Training programs will also be organized in collaboration with international partners engaged in implementing the \nICP such as the IMF, OECD, the United Nations Statistics Division, the World Bank, other RIAs, and agencies such \nas Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific and Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \n15 The TA estimated cost of $2,000,000 will be equally charged to TASF 6 and TASF Others. \n16 Refers to (i) Department of Communications regarding publication and/or dissemination of knowledge products; (ii) \nOffice of Information Systems and Technology; (iii) Office of Administrative Services regarding procurement of \nequipment, software, and other needs of the TA related to information technology; (iv) Procurement, Portfolio and \nFinancial Management regarding consultant recruitment; (v) Controllers Department regarding TA disbursements \nand payments; and (vi) other relevant regional departments. \n17 All 22 ADB member economies participating in the 2017 ICP cycle (footnote 3) are also expected to participate in \nthe 2020 ICP cycle with ADB as the RIA. Discussions will be undertaken with the World Bank to provide capacity \nbuilding to Afghanistan with the intention to include them in future cycles. While Fiji is the only ADB member from the \nPacific participating in the TA, discussions with the World Bank have been initiated to collaborate with the Australian \nBureau of Statistics to take up the role of RIA for the Pacific island economies. The Australian Bureau of Statistics \nwas the RIA for the 20 Pacific economies for the 2011 ICP. \n18 As in the previous ICP rounds of 2005, 2011, and 2017, seed funds will be provided to Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nCambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nthe Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Alternatives \nto APF will be explored with economies where APF is not a preferred mode of transfer of funds. The NIAs will \n \n ", "6 \nassociated  with  survey  data  collection,  data  processing,  documentation,  preparing  reports,  \nworkshops,  trainings,  and  other  miscellaneous  administration  and support costs,  with  prior \nagreement from ADB. The NIAs are assessed to have the financial management capacity and \ninternal controls to handle financial transactions and maintain records.19 The NIAs in the 2005, \n2011, and 2017 ICP benchmark rounds will be the NIAs for the 2020 ICP. The NIAs fulfilled \nfinancial accountability for seed funds received following ADB guidelines, which resulted in the \nsuccessful financial closing of the 2005 and 2011 ICP TA projects and ongoing implementation \nof the 2017 ICP. ADB will make direct payments (e.g., for equipment and software procurement \nand workshop venues) whenever necessary. \n \n15.

Consulting services. The expected outputs from this TA will be produced by a team of \nEROD-SDI international and national staff with significant inputs from international and national \nconsultants. An estimated 15 person-months of international consultancy services and 204 \nperson-months of national consultancy services will be needed for the TA.20 ADB will engage the \nconsultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its \nassociated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.21 The consultants will be \nconsidered for engagement on output-based (lump sum) contracts22 or based on the terms of \nreference, depending on the nature of assignment. \n \n17.  Transfer of funds. The APF will provide limited seed funds to NIAs of selected ADB \nmember  economies  to  implement  project-related  activities  and  strengthen  ICP-related \ninfrastructure and capacity at the national level. Similar arrangements were established and \nfollowed in the 2005, 2011, and 2017 ICP rounds. Other arrangements through instruments such \nas aide-m\u00e9moire or a signed framework of partnership can also be considered in specific cases \nwhere NIA protocols for receiving ADB funds would require alternative arrangements. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s  procurement.  NIAs  will  procure  equipment  and  software following  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy and ADB will procure software for data processing, and desktop, laptop \ncomputers, other information technology equipment, and consumable items if any TA recipient is \nunable to follow ADB procurement guidelines or for purchase of software and IT equipment \nrequirements for project data processing by ADB\u2019s project team. All procurement of software, \ncomputer, and other IT equipment by ADB will follow institutional procurement and contract \nadministration.23 \n \n19.  Social media and websites. All publications and publishable data will be uploaded and \ndisseminated through ADB websites.
