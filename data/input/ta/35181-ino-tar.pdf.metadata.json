The passage of decentralization acts in 1999 and 2004 has radically altered the role of the \ncentral Government, provinces, and districts, and given local authorities new and additional tasks \nand responsibilities. The changes have implications for a variety of economic sectors. For instance, \nthey create opportunities and increased risks for the natural resources based agriculture and \nfisheries sectors and confront local governments (LGs) with the challenge to sustainably manage \ntheir local natural resources.1 The Government of Indonesia has requested Asian Development \nBank (ADB) advisory technical assistance for the project Natural Resources Management in a \nDecentralized Framework to support the Government in promoting sustainable management of \nnatural resources.2 The TA activities will also provide technical support to ongoing ADB financed \nprojects in Indonesia that deal with the management of marine and coastal resources and water \nresources, two priority areas in the draft Country Strategy and Program for 2006\u20132008.3 In June \n2005, the Fact-Finding Mission reached understanding with the Government on the impact and \noutcome,  methodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA.4 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2  Indonesia\u2019s rich natural resources have been a significant asset for economic development. \nHowever,  many  of  the  resources  are  at  risk  or  under  stress:  inadequate  management  and \noverexploitation, coupled with population increase and economic growth, have triggered resource \ndepletion and environmental degradation that have negative implications for medium- and long-\nterm development. Since the use of natural resources constitutes a major source of revenue for \nLGs, in accordance with Laws 32/2004 and 33/2004, short-sighted approaches of overexploitation \nwith long-lasting negative impacts on the conservation and protection of natural resources may \nprevail over long-term approaches of sustainable management. In this context decentralization \nmay be an additional pillar contributing to an accelerated degradation of natural resources.  \n \n3.  The  decentralization  acts5  have  created  a  statutory  framework  for  the  division  of \nadministrative,  political,  and  fiscal  responsibilities  among  different  layers  of  government. \nRegulations, procedures, and guidelines for Laws 32/2004 and 33/2004 are being developed \naccordingly and will have to be adapted to the specific local conditions, taking account of the \nregional income disparities and government institutional capacities. ADB in its quest for viable and \nequitable approaches to the management of natural resources based agriculture, fisheries and \nrural  development  needs  to  take  the  new  evolving  decentralization  policy  framework  with  a \nstrengthened role of LGs fully into account and thoroughly analyze it regarding its effects on \ncurrent and future ADB project interventions. \n \n4  ADB has actively supported the Government in the decentralization process through a \nnumber of loan and TA projects.6 These project interventions have led to strengthened capacity of \n                                                 \n1  Natural resources are land, water, marine and coastal resources that are of direct economic use for human population \ngroups. They are materials that are essential or useful to humans, such as water, air, land, forests, fish and wildlife, \ntopsoils, and minerals. The management of natural resources is the practice of using those resources. \n2  In line with the National Agreement and Action Plan on Sustainable Development (2004) and with the National \nMedium-Term Development Plan of 2004-2009. \n3  The TA is listed in ADB\u2019s CSPU for Indonesia: ADB. 2005. Indonesia: Country Strategy and Program Update. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 28 June 2005. \n5  Law 22/1999 on regional governance, revised under Law 32/2004, and Law 25/1999 on financial compensation of \ninterests between regions and the central Government, revised under Law 33/2004. \n6 ADB. 2000.  Technical Assistance to the Republic of  Indonesia  for  Capacity-Building for Decentralized  Natural \nResources Management. Manila (TA 3523-INO); ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the ", "2   \ngovernment institutions and local communities, but much more needs to be done. A major ADB \ninitiative is the proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant for Local Government Finance and \nGovernance  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  that  is  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  and \nefficiency of delivery of basic public services. As the initiative does not directly address the issue of \nNRM, this TA is expected to establish linkages and create synergies with and/or between the \nbeforementioned program on LG Finance and Governance Reform, through information exchange \nand cooperation in districts selected for case studies. \n \n5.  Decentralized natural resources management as a crosscutting theme has, to a limited \nextent,  been  addressed  by  a  few  external  agencies,  including  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (USAID),  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  and \nGerman  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ).  Most  agencies,  however,  have  expressed \nprimary  interest  in  public  administration,  fiscal  reform,  and  capacity  building  in  support  of \ndecentralization in Indonesia and only rather limited interest in NRM. \n \n6.  The TA shall, inter alia, contribute to filling that NRM thematic gap, and it shall provide \npolicy  advisory  support  to  the  Government  to  improve  and  strengthen  NRM  at  district  and \nprovincial levels, particularly in the context of decentralization. In addition, the TA shall provide \ntechnical support to ongoing ADB financed activities in Indonesia both at policy and at project level. \nFor  instance,  the  TA  will  carry  out  case  studies  in  districts  with  projects  dealing  with  the \nmanagement of coastal and marine resources and/or water resources.  \n \n7.  The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  as  the  ministry  overseeing  the  decentralization \nprocess has been closely collaborating with LGs and with various ministries including the ministries \nof environment, marine affairs and fisheries, agriculture, and forestry. They all are working on an \nagenda that takes sustainable NRM into account, and are in the process of setting up various \nregulatory details, and are defining functional assignments of different layers of government and \nminimum service standards that are to be provided at the local level. Over the next few years, \ntechnical and administrative guidelines will have to be updated or developed. In order to more \neffectively implement the national policies on NRM and deliver the technical and public services, \nthe coordination between district environment agencies and the agriculture, fisheries, forestry, \npublic works district agencies needs to be adjusted and optimized. In this context it is noteworthy \nmentioning that a transparent and fair granting of permissions and licenses for natural resources \nutilization  and  adequate  law  enforcement  are  prerequisites  for  sustainable  NRM.  In  close \ncooperation with MOHA, the TA\u2019s component 1 will provide support for institutional strengthening \nand development. \n \n8.  A key recommendation of TA 3523-INO (footnote 6) has been that it is essential to promote \nthe process of participatory spatial planning.7 It may play an essential role for integrated and sound \ndevelopment planning that benefits NRM at the same time. As spatial planning decisions look \nbeyond  the  usually  sector-dominated  considerations  and  decisions,  they  contribute  to  more \neffectively meeting the multiple requirements of the various NRM sectors and attempt to maximize \nthe efficiency of (natural) resource use for the long-term. Despite some localized good examples of \n                                                                                                                                                               \nBoard of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Marine and Coastal Resources \nManagement Project.

A proper \nlinkage between macro (here: spatial planning/development planning at district level) and micro \nlevel NRM (here: land user decisions at village level) decisions needs to be well established, and \nthe district case studies of TA\u2019s component 2 shall deal with these issues.  \n \n9.  It is recognized that LGs need to continue enhancing their capacity to effectively pursue \nmanagement and planning functions, in relation to NRM and spatial planning. Limited knowledge \non sustainable NRM among LG decision makers and staff has continued to be a bottleneck in \nsustainable development. Improvements can be achieved through a combination of (i) large-scale \nsustainable development and environmental education programs at all levels of society, along with \n(ii) targeted training programs for LGs.8 Transfer of knowledge and provision of tools and decision-\nsupport systems to the LG level are areas that deserve continued attention. New technologies for \ninformation  dissemination  should  be  utilized,  largely  for  reason  of  cost-efficiency.  The  TA\u2019s \ncomponent 3 will provide support to that effect. \n \n10.  The  TA  shall  also  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s  NRM  sector  strategies  for  marine  and  coastal \nmanagement, agriculture and rural development, water resources management and environmental \nprotection and to related ADB project interventions. Moreover, it shall provide support to achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 (ensure environmental sustainability) target 9 (integrate \nthe principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reverse the loss \nof environmental resources) and MDG 1 (eradicate extreme poverty and hunger), and it will be \ncomplementary to multisectoral capacity-building initiatives for LGs. With this TA, ADB continues \nand intends to strengthen its role in NRM in the context of decentralization. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA is expected to mainstream principles and approaches of sustainable NRM into LG \ndecision making and to improve LGs\u2019 capability and capacity to sustainably manage their natural \nresources in selected districts, through (i) enhanced government oversight, (ii) proposed improved \npractices, and (iii) information dissemination and awareness raising. The outcomes and outputs \nare  expected  to  have  overall  positive  effects  and  lead  to  a  more  sustainable  NRM,  that  is \nenvironmentally sound and socioeconomically viable (project impact). Hence, the TA will contribute \nto economic growth and to ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have three components: (i) policy analysis and institutional strengthening and \ndevelopment, (ii) participatory spatial-based planning approaches in the development planning \nprocess, and (iii) awareness raising for decision making in respect of NRM. Activities will be carried \nout at central Government and LG level in up to six districts that will be selected for case studies. \nLessons learned from the district case studies shall help LGs and the central Government in \nimproving  decision  making  regarding  NRM.  Relevant  information,  data,  technical  approaches, \npolicy recommendations, and lessons from other relevant projects as well as views of communities \nand the public will be inputs to the TA study. \n \n                                                 \n8 TA 3523-INO (footnote 5) developed short-term training modules for local government representatives on the following \ntopics: (i) environmental awareness and ecosystem based natural resources planning and management, (ii) natural \nresources and environmental law, and (iii) natural resources accounting and environmental economics. \n ", "4   \n13.  Component  1:  Policy  Analysis  and  Institutional  Strengthening.  It  will  include  a \nthorough review/analysis of the decentralization policy and legislative framework and their impacts \non sustainable NRM, taking into account, among others, experiences gained from past ADB-\nassisted projects. It will include a review of current practices, roles and the functioning of LG (e.g., \nlocal secretariat, dinas, badan9) for NRM and environmental protection, as defined by enacted \nlaws, regulations, and guidelines. The TA will assist MOHA in facilitating and supervising the \nimplementation  of  decentralized  NRM,  including  piloting,  validating,  and  testing  technical \nguidelines  that  are  being  developed  following  the  enactment  of  Laws  32/2004  and  33/2004. \nParticular emphasis will be given to developing recommendations for (i) institutional strengthening \nand reform at district government level, and (ii) improvements in the coordinated functioning of the \ndifferent levels of government.  \n \n14.  Component 2: NRM Development Planning. The TA also aims at adequate reflection of \nand incorporation of NRM and environmental considerations into the district development planning \nprocess. For that it will provide advisory support to strengthen the process of spatial planning at the \ndistrict  level.  The  current  practice  of  spatial  planning  will  be  reviewed  and  analyzed,  and \nbottlenecks will be identified and solutions proposed. The linkage between the district government-\ndriven development planning process and community- and village-based NRM-related activities is \nessential. That is why the TA will analyze examples of districts with successfully established \nlinkages between/integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches in NRM and will draw lessons \nfrom those experiences. In selected districts, the TA will review what are considered good practices \nand determine whether such practices can be replicated in other locations.  \n \n15.  Component  3:  Information  for  Decision  Making.  Further,  the  TA  will  develop  and \ndisseminate tools and information materials for raising awareness among LGs and the public at \nlarge,  including  new  and  innovative  approaches  of  natural  resources  accounting  in  order  to \ndemonstrate the long-term economic value of natural resources. The TA will provide technical \nsupport to MOHA to develop technical guidelines for economic valuation that will be published. The \nabove activities will be carried out in cooperation and consultation with stakeholders from up to six \nselected districts. The TA will establish a website that will provide comprehensive information in \nBahasa Indonesia and English on issues relating to decentralized NRM, including successful \nexamples of community-based NRM and established linkages between/integration of top-down and \nbottom-up approaches in NRM and planning. The website will be operated and maintained by the \nAgency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) up to at least 2 years after TA \nclosing.  \n \n16.  Up to six districts in no more than three provinces will become actively involved in the TA \nthrough district case studies analyzing their specific experiences with NRM before and after 1999\u2013\n2004. Those districts will share lessons learned, recommendations, and conclusions with other \ndistricts, provinces, the central Government and the public. Moreover, the TA will seek views of \nLGs and other stakeholders and hold discussions on institutional strengthening and reform and the \nadequacy of community participation in decision making in respect of NRM. The results of the \naforementioned activities will be captured in case study reports and published on the website. \nInformation materials that will be produced under the TA will be developed in consultation with the \nselected districts and their dissemination tested there as deemed necessary. Criteria for selecting \nthe districts include (i) districts\u2019 achievements in sustainable NRM and environmental management, \n(ii) institutional setup at the district level, and (iii) degree of districts\u2019 fiscal dependence on natural \nresources-based revenues. Districts shall be selected that participate in ADB financed (i) marine \nand  coastal  resources  management  and/or  (ii)  water  resources  management  projects,  and \n                                                 \n9  Dinas \u2013 technical agency of regional government; badan \u2013 a technical supporting institution of government. \n ", "  5\nparticipate  in  ADB\u2019s  proposed  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment Program. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $795,000 equivalent, comprising $315,000 in foreign \nexchange and $480,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will finance $600,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign \nexchange cost of $315,000 and $285,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government \nwill bear the balance of the local currency cost of $195,000 equivalent to cover local travel and \nexpenses for operation and maintenance of the website, the office, and counterpart staff. Details \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MOHA will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will implement it through its Directorate \nGeneral of Regional Development (BANGDA). BANGDA has appointed a project officer who is the \npoint  of  contact  between  BANGDA  and  ADB.  BANGDA  will  provide  logistical  and  other \nadministrative support services. It will closely coordinate with the BPPT that will provide scientific \ninputs and make available its expertise for the TA, particularly relating to the component raising \nawareness for decision making in respect of NRM. Interagency coordination will be ensured by a \nTA steering committee to be chaired by BAPPENAS and co-chaired by BANGDA. The committee \nwill meet periodically to review TA progress and provide guidance and feedback to the consultants. \nIt will have representatives of concerned government agencies such as BAPPENAS, Ministry of \nFinance, MOHA, BPPT, Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Ministry of Environment, Ministry \nof Forestry, and Ministry of Agriculture and of LGs of the case study districts.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented by a team of international consultants (about 11 person-\nmonths)  and  domestic  consultants  (about  43  person-months),  to  be  engaged  through  an \ninternational consulting firm. In view of the multisectoral character of the TA and the need for \ndeveloping innovative solutions, selection of the firm will be based on a full technical proposal \nusing ADB\u2019s quality-based selection method. The team leader, an international consultant, will \nwork full-time in Indonesia for the duration of the TA study. Technical expertise will be required in \npolicy and institutional development, public administration, environment and natural resources \nmanagement  legislation,  participatory  spatial  planning,  NRM,  environmental  management, \nenvironmental  economics  and  accounting,  conflict  resolution  and  community  development, \ninformation management and public relations. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Appendix 3 gives the outline terms of reference. All procurement under the \nTA will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The TA will be implemented over 7 months, from \nFebruary to August 2006.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Indonesia for Natural Resources Management in a Decentralized Framework, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms  \nImpact       \nImprovements in  \u2022  Contribution to achieving  Statistics and regional   \nenvironmentally and  Millennium Development  environmental data \nsocioeconomically  Goal (MDG) 7, target 9 \nsound and sustainable  \u2022  Improved LG development \nnatural resources  planning \nmanagement (NRM) \nOutcomes       \nPrinciples and  \u2022  Enhanced awareness level  Surveys among LG staff  \u2022  Effective \napproaches of  among LG staff and    communication/co-\nsustainable NRM  stakeholders in selected  Final report, back-to- ordination between \nmainstreamed into  districts  office reports  different levels of \nlocal government (LG)  \u2022  Adopted relevant local    government and \ndecision making  regulations and use of  Land quality indicators  other stakeholders \n  relevant guidelines     \nAdvances in LG  \u2022  Interaction and feedback  Website hits  \u2022  Readiness for \ncapability and capacity  between Ministry of Home    institutional reform \nto sustainably manage  Affairs (MOHA) and LGs on  Use of case study  and change of \nrenewable natural  (i) NRM-related experiences  reports in MOHA and  practices \nresources  and requirements at LG  other relevant   \nlevel, and (ii) NRM policy  Government institutions \nrevisions at central   \ngovernment level  Activities with milestones \n(5.) \nOutputs       \n1.
