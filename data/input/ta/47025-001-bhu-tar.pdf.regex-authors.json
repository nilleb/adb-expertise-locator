The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) is consistent with the \nSouth Asia regional cooperation strategy and Bhutan\u2019s interim country partnership strategy and \ncountry operations business plan, which accord high priority for regional connectivity and trade \nfacilitation projects. ADB. 2011.1 The TA was conceptualized following consultations conducted \nfor the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) trade facilitation sector during \nOctober  2012\u2013March  2013,  and  was  included  in  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  regional  cooperation \noperations business plan, 2013\u20132015.2 \n \n2.  The SASEC Trade Facilitation and Transport Working Group (TFTWG)3 met in Kolkata, \nIndia in March 2012 and requested support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the \nimplementation  of  ongoing  priority  trade  facilitation  and  transport  measures,  including  the \nSASEC Trade Facilitation Program approved and financed by ADB in 2012.4 In particular, the \nDepartment of Revenue and Customs (DRC) of Bhutan requested ADB to provide technical \nsupport to strengthen the capacity of Bhutan\u2019s customs in trade facilitation.  \n \n3.  In November 2012, an ADB mission to Thimphu, Bhutan met with the DRC and the \nDepartment of Public Accounts of the Ministry of Finance to further discuss TA requirements. \nThe Government of Bhutan agreed that a new customs capacity building TA proposal should be \nsubmitted to the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for financing consideration. The SASEC \nTrade  Facilitation Week  held  in  March  2013  in  Bangkok, Thailand,  together  with  an  ADB \nmission in April 2013 to Thimphu to meet with the DRC and Department of Public Accounts, \nidentified specific customs components for inclusion in the TA. All consulted parties agreed on \nthe TA design and implementation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The International Finance Corporation/World Bank\u2019s 2013 Doing Business survey ranks \nBhutan 172nd out of 185 countries in its \u201ctrading across borders\u201d category, largely due to \ninfrastructure bottlenecks.6 In addition, Bhutan\u2019s trade competitiveness and market opportunities \nare hampered by (i) regulatory constraints, (ii) complicated trade procedures and formalities, \n(iii) the  absence  of  a  fully  automated  customs  system,  and  (iv)  weak  coordination  among \ndomestic agencies. These barriers contribute to an estimated 38 days required to import or \nexport a standard container, at a cost of $2,230 (export) and $2,330 (import), placing Bhutan \nbelow the South Asia regional average in each component,7 and negatively impacting the \ncountry\u2019s trade potential. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2011.

Regulatory  constraints.  Bhutan\u2019s  regulatory  framework  for  cross-border  trade  is \ncomplex. A lack of comprehensive import and export regulations has led to a current legal \nframework consisting of subsidiary legislation, such as notifications and regulations issued by \nvarious agencies. This creates overlap and complicates the legal context for trade. Further, \nmost of Bhutan\u2019s customs practices are not aligned with international standards as outlined in \nthe  Revised  Kyoto  Convention  (RKC).8  Although  Bhutan  became  a  member  of  the World \nCustoms Organization (WCO) in 2002, the country has not yet signed the RKC. Many regulatory \ndocuments do not conform to international standards such as the United Nations Layout Key \nand the United Nations Trade Data Elements Directories. Data elements on Bhutan\u2019s forms are \nneither coded nor do they use international codes. \n \n6.    Complex trade procedures and formalities. Several trade restrictions that primarily \naffect imports remain in place, including import and export license by road from third countries, \nregistration, and prior import and export approvals. These procedures require more documents \nand increase the time and cost of trading,9 making the current trade environment restrictive. For \nexample, exporting oranges from Bhutan to Bangladesh requires 16 documents, takes 15 days, \nand costs $1,852 per truck.10 \n \n7.  Lack of fully automated customs management system. Bhutan customs procedures \nare not considered a major barrier to the business climate, with only 3.3% of manufacturing \nbusinesses viewing customs as a major constraint.11 However, Bhutan customs could still do \nbetter to facilitate trade. For instance, Bhutan is currently using the Bhutan Automated Customs \nSystem to provide trade statistics and process declarations. However, this system only allows \nfor semi-automated clearance, does not provide real-time linkages between regional offices, \nand is slow and unstable; in particular, updating information in the system is not easy and \nrequires additional manual processing. Further, there is no risk management system linked to \nthe Bhutan Automated Customs System. Recently, the DRC included a customs functionality in \nthe  regulatory  audit  management  information  system,  which  is  being  developed  and \nimplemented with ADB\u2019s support.  \n \n8.  Weak coordination of government agencies involved in trade. The 11 domestic \nagencies currently involved in entry and exit clearance of goods are customs, quarantine, \nhealth, agriculture, forestry, environment, economic affairs, narcotics control, immigration, army \nborder control, and information and communication. However, not all of these agencies are \npresent at border crossings and stations, there is no integrated clearance workflow, and the \nsharing  of  data  or  information  among  different  agencies  is  limited.  Although  working \nrelationships are good, this lack of coordination adds to a longer waiting time for traders and \nplaces a greater burden on customs. In addition, there is no institution that serves to promote \ntrade facilitation and through which public and private entities engaged in international trade can \ndiscuss problems and seek solutions. \n \n9.  Bhutan is an active member of the TFTWG and, together with Bangladesh and Nepal, is \ncommitted to the SASEC Trade Facilitation Program (footnote 4), which aims to increase trade, \nincluding intraregional trade, of SASEC countries by reducing or removing nontariff barriers \n                                                \n8  The RKC\u2014or the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures\u2014came \ninto effect in 1999 and represents the most widely accepted blueprint for modern customs operations. \n9  United Nations Development Programme. 2010.

Initial experience suggests that the Government of Bhutan requires assistance \nin ensuring that the policy actions and tranche conditions under the SASEC Trade Facilitation \nProgram are fulfilled.12 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be a reduction in time and cost of trade for Bhutan as indicated \nby a decrease in the time to import and export. The outcome will be better alignment of Bhutan \ncustoms procedures and practices with internationally accepted standards.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.    The  TA  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  supporting  Bhutan\u2019s  accession  to  the  RKC, \n(ii) enhancing the capacity of customs automation, and (iii) establishing a functional national \ntrade facilitation body. \n \n12.  Supporting  Bhutan\u2019s accession  to  the  Revised  Kyoto  Convention. The TA  will \nassist in preparing the necessary legal, administrative, and technical documents necessary for \nBhutan\u2019s accession to the RKC. It will conduct a regulatory impact assessment report on the \nproposed amendments to Bhutan\u2019s laws, rules, and regulations, which are required to ensure \nBhutan\u2019s compliance with the General Annex of the RKC. The TA will promote understanding \nand awareness among key stakeholders in Bhutan of the benefits and implications of the RKC. \nIn collaboration with the WCO, the TA will conduct technical training on the General Annex of \nthe RKC for relevant customs officials. Initially, the TA will involve customs, but may later \ninvolve other government agencies.  \n \n13.  Enhancing capacity of customs automation. The TA will support systems upgrades \nto  the  Regulatory  Audit  Management  Information  System.  The  implementation  of  customs \nfacilitation measures will be brought in line with the RKC through the provision of technical \nexpertise and limited software and hardware assistance. The TA will carry out a comprehensive \ntraining needs assessment for customs automation and, based on this assessment, conduct \ntraining for relevant customs officials at headquarters and key border checkpoints. \n \n14.  Establishing a functional national trade facilitation body. As part of the SASEC \nTrade Facilitation Program, the Government of Bhutan issued an executive order to establish \nthe National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC) of Bhutan in February 2013. The role of the \nNTFC is to ensure proper coordination and smooth implementation of the cross-sectoral SASEC \nTrade Facilitation Program. The NTFC has eight members: the chair (secretary of the Ministry of \nFinance); five directors (from the DRC, the Bhutan Standards Bureau, and the ministries of \nEconomic Affairs, Agriculture and Forests, and Home and Cultural Affairs); one deputy governor \n(from the Royal Monetary Authority); and one secretary general (from the Bhutan Chamber of \nCommerce  and  Industries).13  The  TA  will  provide  strategic  and  technical  advice  to  the \ngovernment to support the effective operations of the NTFC. It will conduct NTFC meetings and \n                                                \n12  Bangladesh and Nepal are also recipients of SASEC Trade Facilitation Program loans and grants, and both face a \nsimilar situation in terms of requiring assistance to put into effect the reforms being promoted under the Program. \nCDTA support is also being planned for Bangladesh and Nepal. \n13  Royal Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Finance Order dated 18 February 2013.  \n ", "4 \nprovide capacity building and support to the secretariat. The TA will conduct a study to identify \nthe possibility of making operations of the NTFC self-sustaining. \n  \n15.  The TA assumes that physical infrastructure to facilitate trade (such as road and rail \nsections and border-crossing infrastructure  along SASEC corridors) has been upgraded or \nmodernized to realize the desired results from complementary trade facilitation measures.  \n \n16.  The TA further assumes that the government remains committed to trade facilitation and \nsubregional cooperation with other SASEC countries. A key risk is lobbying against customs \nmodernization by groups with vested interests. The commitment of the government to reforms \nwithin SASEC countries and the South Asian region will mitigate this risk as reforms in trade \nfacilitation measures result in better and more efficient customs services for the business sector.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,650,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from August 2013 to July 2015. ADB\u2019s \nSouth  Asia  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  Bhutan\u2019s  DRC  will  be  the \nimplementing  agency.  ADB  will  work  closely  with  the  WCO  and  other  international \norganizations, such as the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific, to implement the TA, particularly activities under outputs 1 and 2 (Appendix 1). In \nJanuary 2013, ADB\u2019s South Asia Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division \nand the WCO Regional Office for Capacity Building in Asia and the Pacific met in Bangkok for a \n1-day planning retreat.14 ADB and the WCO agreed on six themes for capacity building: (i) \nGeneral Annex Provisions of the RKC;  (ii) SAFE Framework of Standards; (iii) authorized \neconomic operators; (iv) risk management; (v) post-clearance audit; and (vi) time release study. \nBuilding on a training needs assessment workshop held on 28 March 2013, three tentative \ntraining programs have been identified for 2013: (i) a regional knowledge-sharing workshop; (ii) \na regional workshop on the WCO compendium on national single window for SASEC countries, \nthe Maldives, and Sri Lanka; and (iii) a regional workshop on time release study for Bangladesh, \nBhutan,  and  Nepal.  WCO  officials  will  regularly  share  their  semiannual  capacity  building \nprograms with ADB to better synchronize training programs between both institutions.15 \n \n19.  Consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  A  total  of  146.5  person-months  of  consultancy  services  (60.5  person-months  of \ninternational  consultancy  and  86  person-months  of  national  consultancy  services)  will  be \n                                                \n14 The retreat was attended by the following representatives from the WCO Regional Office for Capacity Building in \nAsia and the Pacific: Yoshihiro Kosaka, Head (Director); Shigeaki Katsu, Deputy Head; and Cheng Jing, Technical \nAttach\u00e9.

The breakdown is as follows: (i) 28 person-months each for international customs \nspecialist and international trade facilitation specialist; (ii) 24 person-months for national trade \nfacilitation specialist and 38 person-months for national legal specialist; (iii) 24 person-months \nfor the national program coordinator; and (iv) 4.5 person-months for international resources \npersons for capacity building activities. Individual consultants will be engaged on the basis of (i) \nthe diversity of tasks to be undertaken, (ii) expected active involvement of focal points in the \nDRC,  and  (iii)  active  overall  management  by  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Department  of  the  TA \nimplementation. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n21.  The  TA  will  be  monitored  and  coordinated  principally  through  the  meetings  of  the \nTFTWG, as well as national and regional meetings to be held under the auspices of the TA.16 \nEvaluation of the TA\u2019s outputs will be carried out by ADB\u2019s South Asia Department through the \nannual TA implementation review mission.  \n \n22.  Good practices and lessons learned from the TA will be (i) documented in the progress \nreports submitted to the TFTWG; (ii) posted on the SASEC website (www.sasec.asia); and \n(iii) reported  during  meetings  of  ADB\u2019s  regional  cooperation  and  integration  community  of \npractice. \n \nIV.
