India is experiencing rapid overall economic growth; however, economic disparity between \nurban and rural areas persists and rural transformation and poverty reduction are slow compared \nto  other countries  in  the  region.1 Contributing to  this  is  the  absence of  well-planned  rural \ninfrastructure, which undermines agricultural productivity and increases vulnerability to natural \nhazards and climate change. A key cause is the weak capacities and poor coordination in the \nplanning, design, and implementation of projects of rural infrastructure stakeholders\u2014comprising \nlocal, state, and central government; private sector (consultants and contractors); and academic \ninstitutions. Exposure to new innovations and good practices in the agriculture and natural \nresources sector is limited, resulting in the continuation of a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach. The \nresult is persistently slow progress in meeting targets for rural development, design, construction \nsupervision, performance, and sustainability of the assets, as well as limited consideration of \nexternal factors, such as climate change. \n2.  Two of the seven operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy \n2030 are (i) promoting rural development and food security; and (ii) tackling climate change, \nbuilding  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability. 2 \nADB\u2019s investments in these areas have generated jobs, raised rural incomes, and reduced \npoverty.3 The Strategy 2030 emphasizes the need for (i) increasing the focus on the water\u2013food\u2013\nenergy security nexus; (ii) improving market connectivity and agriculture value chain linkages; \n(iii) increasing  agricultural  productivity  and  food  security;  and  (iv)  enhancing  food  safety. \nStrengthening governance and institutional capacity of executing and implementing agencies for \neffective project implementation to achieve inclusive and sustainable development is also a \npriority.  This  is  also  essential  to  support  the  Strategy  2030\u2019s  objectives  in  streamlining \nADB business processes to strengthen development effectiveness and ensure that ADB delivers \nvalue for money. \n3.  Continuous support to enhance skills and competencies of executing and implementing \nagencies  is  needed  to  improve  project  preparation,  implementation,  and  overall  portfolio \nperformance. Sustainable development of ADB water and rural infrastructure projects requires \nstronger interaction between stakeholders coupled with dedicated government capacity building \nin the areas of project design and implementation. The proposed transaction technical assistance \n(TA) facility would bridge capability gaps and enable the application of best practices to ADB-\nfunded projects. Capacity-building support will be provided through the provision of incremental \nconsulting services to enhance project preparatory and project implementation capacity. The TA \nfacility will be demand-driven to ensure ownership by, and commitment from, the executing and \nimplementing agencies. \n4.  The TA facility will support project preparation, including capacity-building, undertaking \ndue diligence, and increasing project readiness for ensuing investment projects, including those \nidentified in the country operations business plan for India, 2019\u20132021.4 It will initially support:  \n                                                \n1  IFAD. 2016.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n(i)  Ara  Canal  Water  Productivity  Improvement  Project  (formerly  Bihar  Irrigation \nProject); \n(ii)  Himachal Pradesh Subtropical Horticulture and Irrigation Value-Addition Project; \n(iii)  Capacity  Development  for  Irrigation  Management  and  due-diligence  for  new \nprojects including Upper Bhadra Project and Lower Suktel Irrigation Project; \n(iv)  Assam Flood and Riverbank Erosion Protection Project (follow-on loan 2020); \n(v)  Maharashtra Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management; \n(vi)  Maharashtra Rural Connectivity Improvement Project; and \n(vii)  Preparation of Maharashtra Agribusiness Network Project. \n5.  These projects are all in the rural sector and have similar due diligence requirements. \nThe TA facility approach is suitable as it will (i) enhance project preparation efficiency and improve \nreadiness for projects that have limited processing resources; (ii) reap important synergies from \nworking with the same team of consultants, including reducing lengthy tendering processes and \nimproving knowledge transfer; and (iii) strengthen coordination. Overall, this TA facility will reduce \ntransaction costs through minimizing the resources of standalone transaction TA projects.  \n6.  The TA facility will also support ongoing projects with additional expertise as required and \nagreed with the project\u2019s executing agencies. It will initially support: \n(i)  Assam Integrated Flood and River Erosion Risk Management and Investment \nProgram; \n(ii)  Madhya Pradesh Irrigation Efficiency Improvement Project;  \n(iii)  Climate adaptation in Vennar Subbasin in Cauvery Delta Project; and \n(iv)  Karnataka Integrated and Sustainable Water Resources Management Investment \nProgram. \n7.  These ongoing projects are suffering from weak project implementation capacity and \nrequire similar technical specialist support to ensure project sustainability. The TA facility will \nsupport projects that are listed in the current country operations business plan for India, as well \nas future projects that the government may propose for ADB\u2019s assistance. \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n8.  Output 1: Well-designed agriculture, rural development and water resource project \nproposals and project readiness achieved. Technical expertise will be provided to support \npreparation  of  selected  investment  projects  for  potential  ADB  financing.  This  will  include \nnecessary due diligences involving assessments of (i) technical suitability; (ii) economic and \nfinancial  sustainability;  (iii)  capacity  and  institutional  issues;  (iv) environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; and (v) identification of measures to strengthen project implementation capacity of \nprojects.  Assistance  to  meet  project  readiness  conditions  will  also  be  provided,  including \nrecruitment of project implementation consultants and technical inputs for loan processing. \nDetailed activities will include support for (i) feasibility studies required for the ensuing investment; \n(ii) economic analysis; (iii) financial management assessment, financial evaluation and financial \nanalysis; (iv) gender analysis, collection of baseline data, and gender action plans; (v) risk \nassessment and management plans; (vi) safeguards documents on environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples;  (vii)  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments  and \nadaptation measures; (viii) sector assessment; (ix) preparation of loan processing documents; \n(x) project implementation consultant recruitment; (xi) preparation of bidding documents and \nassisting  with  advance  procurement  activities;  and  (xii)  initiating  resettlement  plan \nimplementation. \n ", "3 \n9.  Output 2: Project implementation and management capacity of executing agency \nimproved. Technical expertise and capacity building will be provided to selected executing \nagencies in India to enhance water and rural investment sustainability. Support will be provided \nthrough consultants to ongoing or ensuing water and rural investments and programs within the \ncore TA facility priority areas. The focus will be on enhancing procurement, construction and \ncontract management, fiduciary requirements and safeguard processes, gender mainstreaming, \nand monitoring capacity. The TA facility will utilize the same consultants across multiple projects \nto allow knowledge transfer of best practices. Support will also include workshops and on-the-job-\ntraining to enhance the capacity of State line departments. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The key expenditure items are listed in  \nAppendix 1. The TA facility scope is expected to be expanded to cover other additional activities, \nconsistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and outcome, and funds will be replenished from time to time as \nrequired. \n11.  The  State  line  departments  responsible  for  each  project  will  be  asked  to  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of assigning counterpart staff providing office accommodation, \nworkshop and training facilities, domestic transportation, project related information, and other in-\nkind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA facility does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing \nagency  of  the  TA  facility.  ADB  through  its  South  Asia  Department\u2019s  Environment,  Natural \nResources, and Agriculture Division will be responsible for TA facility administration and will work \nclosely with the executing and State line departments of the ongoing and planned projects in \nIndia.  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  the  recruitment,  management  and  administration  of  all \nconsultants financed by the TA facility. ADB will inform the Department of Economic Affairs and \nthe relevant State line departments of selected consultants prior to their mobilization. \n13.  The  TA  facility  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  from  June  2019  to  May  2022. \nDisbursements under the TA facility will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  June 2019 \u2013 May 2022 \nExecuting agency  Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agency  Various State line department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB.a \n  ICS (international)  44.50 person-months  $1,202,000 \n  ICS (national)  80.60 person-months  $532,000   \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n ", "4   \nAspects  Arrangements \nAsset turnover or disposal  None \narrangement upon TA \ncompletion \na Individual consultants will be the preferred selection method however, if needed, consulting firms may be selected for \nwhich the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used with a ratio of 90:10 for technical to financial scoring. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, SAER = South Asia Department Environment, \nNatural Resources, and Agriculture Division, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.  Consulting services. The TA facility will provide an initial 125.1 person-months of \nconsulting services (44.5 person-months, international and 80.6 person-months, national) in the \nfield of rural infrastructure, water resources and irrigation, flood Management, procurement, \neconomics, financial management, environment, safeguards, social development, gender, and \nproject  coordination.5 It  is  expected  that  the  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  individual \nconsultant selection method and deployed based on the requirements of each project based on \neach project\u2019s needs. The consultants will be competitively engaged by ADB in accordance with \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated project \nadministration instructions/TA Staff Instructions.6 Individual consultant selection, rather than a \nteam of consultants through a firm, is appropriate in this instance because the TA facility involves \nmultiple activities that are not necessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of \nconsultants  and  services.  However,  where  suitable,  recruitment  through  a  firm  might  be \nconsidered.  \nE.  Governance  \n16.  Since ADB will administer the TA facility, the financial management, procurement and \nintegrity risks during TA facility implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough risk \nassessments  for  financial  management,  procurement,  and  integrity  for  ensuing  investment \nprojects implemented in any of the target countries will be conducted under the TA facility. \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis to \nIndia for the Strengthening Capacity to Design and Implement Water and Rural Infrastructure \nFacility and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n                                                \n5 TA facility savings may be utilized for additional consultant inputs, as may be necessary. \n6 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "Appendix 1               5 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
