INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Concept Paper for the Project was prepared by the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department,  Governance  and  Regional  Cooperation  Division  (RSGR),  and \ncleared by the Knowledge Management Committee in February 2002.1  \n \n2.  The regional technical assistance (TA) is designed to create an enabling environment for \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  to  share  information  on  policies  and  measures  that \nimprove local governments' responsiveness in providing basic services to the poor. The TA was \ndesigned on the assumption that (i) DMCs continue to face significant challenges in providing \nresponsive, equitable, and affordable services, particularly to the poor and the marginalized; \nand (ii) local governments in the region have limited opportunities to learn and share information \non policies and measures that improve responsiveness in service delivery to the poor. In \ndesigning the TA, the RSGR considered ADB\u2019s involvement in pro-poor service delivery at the \nlocal government level and studied the preparatory work being carried out by the World Bank for \nthe World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People. The Governance \nCommittee will select the participating DMCs (para. 12). Approval will be obtained from the \nconcerned DMCs before the list is finalized. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In their efforts to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of basic services, many \nDMCs  have  transferred  the  responsibility  for  service  delivery  to  local  governments.  The \ncountries  where  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  assisting  decentralization  include \nBangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan. The most common services transferred \ninclude primary health care, primary education, and water and sanitation. In addition, many \ngovernments have introduced a range of policies and measures to improve responsiveness in \ndelivering public services, particularly to the poor. The new measures include participatory \npoverty assessments (PPAs), social audit as a mechanism for the community to survey service \ndelivery, participatory planning, and citizens' charters. The extent to which these policies and \npractices are appropriate and effective in the context of services provided by local governments \nrequires analysis. Furthermore, within local governments, there is little comparative regional \ninformation on (i) the impact of these efforts in improving services for poor people; and (ii) \nbenchmarking2 the quality of the responsiveness in delivering services.    \n \n4.  In local governments planning for delivery of services is a complex and constantly \nevolving process; it should reflect the needs of the users and involve the community and \nstakeholders.  The  issues  are  (i)  the  effectiveness  of  the  local  government\u2019s  process  for \nassessing the needs of the poor; (ii) the level of consultation, particularly how local governments \nreach out to the poor; and (iii) the extent of feedback loops from social audits and report cards in \nthe planning process. \n \n5.  A challenge that faces local governments is identifying and targeting the poor to ensure \nequitable and affordable basic services. The issues as follows (i) do all local governments in a \nDMC have a consistent definition of poverty, (ii) do the local governments have a database for \ntracking poverty incidence in their localities, and (iii) how are the poor identified? \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 August 2002.  \n2  Benchmarking is simply about making comparisons with other organizations and then learning the lessons that \nthose comparisons reveal. (Source: The European Benchmarking Code of Conduct)  ", "2 \n \n6.  PPAs were conducted in a number of countries to inform the poverty reduction strategies \nof DMCs. The key issues are (i) the extent to which the PPA indicates the responsiveness of \nservice delivery to the poor; (ii) the extent to which local governments use PPAs to enhance the \nresponsiveness of service delivery; and (iii) whether PPAs are appropriate instruments for \nassessing decentralized service delivery to the poor.  \n \n7.  Service delivery surveys, sometimes referred to as social audits or report cards, are \nbeing promoted in response to the growing pressure of bringing citizens voice and client focus \nto service delivery. The issues follow (i) do service delivery surveys cover the poor and the \nmarginalized effectively; (ii) are the results of the surveys fed back into the local government \ndecision-making processes to improve service delivery; (iii) to what extent are the poor involved \nin conducting the surveys; and (iv) are the surveys conducted at regular intervals to track \nchanges in performance. \n \n8.  Citizens' charters have been introduced as a policy framework for service delivery in \nseveral  countries,  specifically  in  India  and  Bangladesh,  to  improve  the  effectiveness  and \nefficiency of public services. A key component of the policy is concerned with consulting citizens \nabout the level and quality of services they receive. The issues follow (i) how effective is the \ncitizens\u2019 charter as a policy framework for improving responsiveness in service delivery; (ii) to \nwhat extent have local governments adopted the citizens' charter as a policy framework to \nimprove  responsiveness  in  delivering  services;  (iii)  would  local  governments  benefit  from \ninternational experience on the use of citizens\u2019 charters; and (iv) do central and state/provincial \ngovernments have a policy framework requiring local governments to use citizens\u2019 charters to \nconsult citizens\u2014particularly the poor\u2014in assessing the delivery of basic services. In some \ninstances  local  governments  are  obliged  to  negotiate  minimum  standards  with  citizens. \nResponsiveness depends on policies adopted by service providers and is associated with \nplanning and reviewing service delivery, and getting citizens\u2019 feedback.     \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The  TA  will  (i)  study  the  policies  and  practices  adopted  by  local  governments  in \nparticipating DMCs to improve responsiveness in delivering services and share the findings, \ngood practices, and lessons in the region; and (ii) give local governments the opportunity to \nlearn  from  international  good  practice  through  a  regional  seminar  where  international \npractitioners will share knowledge and experience gained. More specifically, the TA will  \n \n(i)  assess  service  delivery  planning  and  determine  whether  local  governments \ninvolve the community, particularly the poor, in planning; \n(ii)  determine how municipalities identify and target the poor; \n(iii)  examine whether social audits, client satisfaction surveys, and report cards are \neffective mechanisms for reviewing service delivery to the poor and improving \nresponsiveness; \n(iv)  examine  whether  citizens'  charters  improve  the  responsiveness  of  service \ndelivery to the poor; \n(v)  consider  opportunities  for  benchmarking  responsiveness  in  the  delivery  of \nservices;  ", "    3 \n(vi)  identify policies, processes, and approaches used by local governments that can \nbe shared more widely for responsive service delivery in the region; and \n(vii)  facilitate regional learning and sharing of experiences and good practices to \nimprove the responsiveness of services.  \n \n10.  The TA intends to raise awareness of improved responsiveness of service delivery to the \npoor, specifically by disseminating the following: \n \n(i)  three case studies on international experiences and good practices; \n(ii)  three self-assessments of DMC performance and experience in service delivery; \n(iii)  action  plan  of  local  government  participants  from  DMCs  for  improving \nresponsiveness of service delivery to the poor; \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s next steps in improving responsiveness in pro-poor service delivery; and \n(v)  proceedings of the regional seminar. \n  \n11.  To achieve a focused set of outputs and complement initiatives already under way in \nADB and other agencies, the TA will not cover the role of civil society, including the private \nsector, in the actual delivery of services.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The Governance Committee3 in close consultation with the regional departments, will \nselect three DMCs. There will not be more than one DMC per subregion. Further, clearance \nfrom the concerned DMC government will be obtained prior to implementation of the TA in the \nDMC. The key criteria for selecting are as follows: \n \n(i)  Where ADB is already involved through a program/project in improving service \ndelivery through local governments; \n(ii)  Where  local  governments  have  introduced  policy  measures  for  improving \nresponsiveness in service delivery; \n(iii)  Where the existing organizational arrangements can be used to establish the in-\ncountry pro-poor service delivery team comprising local government champions4 \nwho will actively participate in the TA; \n(iv)  Where the institutional arrangements for the existing ADB programs/projects can \nfacilitate5  the  collection  of  local  data  and  information  through  prepared  and \nstructured questionnaires; and \n(v)  Where DMCs, including the identified local governments, have requested that \nthey be involved in the research and knowledge exchange to be undertaken by \nthe TA. \n \n13.  The Governance Committee will also need to consider whether a sector focus or a \nrural/urban focus will give more depth to the TA. \n \n                                                 \n3  The Governance and Capacity Building Committee is one of the thematic committees in ADB that assist in \ninfluencing strategic directions and policy. \n4  Local government champions are local government officials who are involved in ADB-assisted programs/projects in \nimproving  service  delivery  in  their  locality,  i.e.,  have  responsibility  for  planning,  directing,  implementing,  or \nmonitoring services delivery. They should be committed to sharing information with other local government \nchampions and willing to learn from the experiences of others. \n5  The TA will fund the data collection exercise. ", "4 \n14.  After completing the selection, a pro-poor service delivery working group led by the \ngovernance specialist from RSGR and comprising ADB operational staff responsible for the \nexisting programs/projects in the selected DMCs will be constituted. The working group will \noversee  and  supervise  implementation  of  the  TA  to  ensure  its  relevance  to  improved \nresponsiveness of service delivery in the region, and will select the local government champions \nto comprise the in-country pro-poor service delivery team. Staff from RSGR will serve as the \nsecretariat for the working group and will be responsible for coordinating the TA activities. \n \n15.  After participating DMCs are selected, there will be an inception phase to address the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  the terms of reference for the in-country pro-poor service delivery TA teams; \n(ii)  proposal  for  bringing  in  the  experience  of  three  countries  where  the  local \ngovernments  have  made  demonstrable  improvements  in  service  delivery  to \ncitizens,  particularly  the  poor,  and  not  as  one-off  experiments  but  as \ninstitutionalized practices to ensure sustainability; \n(iii)  a common format or protocol for assessing the level of responsiveness in service \ndelivery by local governments in the three DMCs; \n(iv)  a proposal for the regional seminar and products and the basis for inviting and \nfunding participants to the seminar; and \n(v)  a timetable for implementation and the responsibility matrix. \n \n16.  A  team  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  implement  the  TA.  Resource \nspeakers from three local government institutions will be invited to prepare and present papers \non best practices and lessons learned in service delivery.   \n \n17.  A key feature of the TA is the establishment of in-country pro-poor service delivery \nteams  comprising  local  government  champions  that  will  (i)  assess  the  current  level  of \nresponsiveness  in  delivering  services  in  their  locality,  and  (ii)  present  the  results  of  the \nassessment at a regional seminar. The local government champions will be selected for their \ninvolvement in ADB-assisted programs/projects to improve service delivery in their locality and \ntheir membership/linkages with the local government network in the DMC. The in-country teams \nwill also ensure that the benefits of the TA are widely shared through existing local government \nnetworks.  \n \n18.  The TA will culminate in the regional seminar where two sets of presentations will be \nmade:  \n \n(i)  a self-assessment by the participating DMCs on their levels of responsiveness in \nproviding services, particularly to the poor; and \n(ii)  presentations by resource speakers from three international local government \ninstitutions on successful institutionalized systems and processes for improving \nresponsiveness in service delivery. \n \n19.  The participants of the regional seminar will include up to four members from each \nparticipating  DMC  and  one  resource  person  from  each  of  the  three  local  government \ninstitutions. The proceedings of the seminar and the case studies will be available on the ADB \nGovernance web site. \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $250,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  RSGR  will  implement  the  TA.  Participating  DMCs'  concurrence  on  the  TA  will  be \nobtained on a no-objection basis.  \n \n22.  The TA will require up to 27 person-months of consulting services (5 international and up \nto 22 domestic). ADB will engage all consultants as individuals in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for engaging domestic consultants. Outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The  experiences  gained  under  the  TA  will  be  disseminated  through  the  ADB \nGovernance web site and a publication on lessons learned and suggested next steps will follow. \n \n24.  The TA will begin in February 2003 and be completed in November 2003. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis for \nGood Practice on Pro-Poor Service Delivery by Local Governments, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n     \nPerformance  Monitoring  Assumptions
