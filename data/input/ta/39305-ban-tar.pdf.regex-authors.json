The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program for Bangladesh \n(2006\u20132010)1 includes support for the urban primary healthcare sector development program. \nThe Government of Bangladesh is supportive of ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA) to assess the \nachievements of the ongoing Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP) and to explore \nfurther support for urban health sector issues.2 This TA is part of ADB\u2019s support to prepare the \nurban primary health care sector development program loan.3 A fact-finding mission visited \nBangladesh in July 2007 and reached an understanding with the Government on the purpose, \noutput,  methodology,  key  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation \narrangements, design and monitoring framework (see Appendix 1) and terms of reference of the \nTA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy4 reaffirms that reducing poverty \nand accelerating the pace of social development are the most important long-term strategic \ngoals. In the health sector, the strategy accords priority to improving maternal and child health \ncare;  strengthening  nutrition  programs;  controlling  communicable  diseases;  and  reorienting \nhealth care assistance, finance and governance to serve the poorest groups better. Parallel to \nthe Government\u2019s Health and Population Sector Development Program, which is concentrated \non improving rural health care service delivery and supported by other development partners, \nADB\u2019s primary focus has been on the delivery of health care services in urban areas through \npublic-private partnerships. ADB\u2019s strategy for improving health care conditions for the urban \npoor  are  to  (i)  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  for  decentralization  of  health  services, \ncommunicable disease control, and reproductive health; (ii) develop public-private partnerships \nfor primary health care services; (iii) enhance the private sector\u2019s role in health service provision; \nand (iv) develop alternative health care financing schemes.  \n \n3.  Public health encompasses multi-sector interventions. To maximize the development \nimpact of health outcomes in urban areas, comprehensive and concerted effort is required to (i) \nexpand access to urban primary health care services; (ii) strengthen municipal public health \ngovernance  (including  institutions,  policy,  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  and  financial \ncapacity); and (iii) strengthen food and water safety, and improve management of solid waste, \nincluding  hospital  waste.  Key  issues  are  the  multi-sector  nature  of  public  health  in  an \nincreasingly complex urban physical space; prioritization of investments that balance preventive, \npromotive and health care needs of the urban poor; and ensuring a strong institutional, policy, \nlegal and regulatory environment for enforcing good public health practices and building on the \nstrengths of the private sector. There are two main dimensions to sustaining the urban primary \nhealth care initiative, covering institutional and financing issues. The institutional structure of the \nproject modality is ad hoc. Bangladesh\u2019s second Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-II) \nhas a project management unit for the project\u2019s duration (July 2005\u2013December 2011).5 The unit \nneeds  to  be  internalized  within  the  governmental  budget  system  so  that  the  institutional \narrangement  becomes  sustainable  and  core  staff  are  retained  within  the  Government  to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Bangladesh Country Strategy and Program, 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n2  During the country program meeting in October 2006, the loan, which was initially for 2008, was shifted to 2009. \n(ADB. 2006. Bangladesh: Country Operations Business Plan. Manila). \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 June 2007. \n4  Government of Bangladesh. 2005. Unlocking the potential: National strategy for accelerated poverty reduction. \nDhaka. \n5  ADB. 2005. Second Urban Primary Health Care Project. Manila. \n ", "2   \nmanage urban primary health care for the next couple of decades. The risk of an ad hoc \napproach is that the Government\u2019s urban primary health care initiative is less likely to draw \nbudget support from the Government on a sustained basis if there is no sustainable institutional \narrangement in place.  \n \n4.  Only six city corporations and five municipal towns are covered under UPHCP-II, which \nleaves most municipal towns uncovered. However, in the absence of a strong institutional \nstructure, the scope for the project to expand geographically will be an issue. Hence, the \ncapacity of the project management structures to expand without compromising on quality and \neffectiveness needs to be reviewed, as do measures to enhance the capacity of the project \nmanagement unit to undertake an expanded program. Urban primary health care needs to be \ninstitutionalized as a program rather than a project, and the capacity of smaller municipal towns \nto implement such a program needs to be assessed. Institutional arrangements to strengthen \nurban public health through training and capacity development programs will be important and \nalso need to be assessed.  \n \n5.  The mandates of urban local bodies relating to essential public health functions should \nbe examined carefully in close coordination with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the \nMinistry of Environment and Forestry, and the health donor community. The review should \nidentify areas that are not addressed and those that need improvement. The assessment should \nthen identify effective legal, regulatory, policy and other interventions to be undertaken by the \nLocal Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives  so  that  urban  local  bodies  may  effectively  implement  essential  public  health \nfunctions that fall under their mandate. Due to competing demands among urban local bodies \nfor scarce resources, and growing urban infrastructure needs, primary health care and public \nhealth often have low priority within municipal budget systems. Wealthy people in urban areas \ncan afford private health care, which is growing rapidly in urban areas. However, the poor and \nmarginalized living in slums, as well as squatters, need support for primary health care financed \nthrough public resources. The very low level of allocations for primary health care and public \nhealth within urban local bodies needs to be ramped up slowly and steadily by increasing \nallocations for urban health within the local government system. Municipal financing with respect \nto budget support for urban primary health care and public health needs to be assessed, as do \nvarious options for sustainable financing of urban primary health care. \n \n6.  The first and the second urban primary health care projects have set new modes for \ndelivering social services through innovative public-private partnerships, which are proving to be \nmore effective than the traditional mode of public service delivery.6 Within urban infrastructure, \npublic-private partnerships have done much to address solid waste management in South Asia. \nLikewise, other aspects of essential public health functions are amenable to public-private \npartnerships, including food safety laboratories, slaughter houses and so on. Gaps in essential \npublic health functions need to be identified, with an assessment made about which functions \ncould be dealt with through public-private partnerships, especially solid waste and hospital \nwaste management. \n \n7.  Prevention and promotion are more cost-effective in ensuring desired health outcomes. \nPrevention and promotion require a multi-sector approach that includes provision of sanitation \nservices and drinking water, environmental health, food safety and hygiene (including safe \ndisposal of solid and hospital waste), and health education. However, the mandates for these \nessential  health  functions  are  fragmented  between  various  government  departments  and \n                                                 \n6  Evaluation reports are available at http://www.adb.org/Health/contracting-BAN.asp \n ", "  3\nbetween the public and private sectors. A more coherent approach is required to ensure that all \nthe players involved in ensuring public health coordinate and cooperate. To some extent, the \nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare undertakes this responsibility in rural areas. At the city \nand municipal level, the mandate is mainly with urban local bodies. However, in the absence of \nstrong institutional mechanisms within the LGD in this regard, city and municipal corporations \nare playing, at best, a weak role in supporting essential public health functions within their \njurisdictions.  Local  governments  have  various  instruments  to  enforce  \u201cpublic  health  good\u201d: \ntaxation, regulation, investments and information. Essential public health functions need to be \nlooked at comprehensively from an urban local government perspective to identify gaps in \nregulation (legal) and enforcement, and taxation and other incentives (policy), in order then to \npromote better public health. Such an assessment needs also to assess the effectiveness of \ninformation dissemination mechanisms to promote public health in urban areas.  \n \n8.  Communicable  disease  prevalence  continues  to  be  significant  in  Bangladesh.  The \nreason  for  this  can  be  traced  largely  to  poor  food  safety,  poor  sanitation  and  sewage \ninfrastructure, weak solid waste and hospital waste management, and almost negligible waste \nwater treatment. Contamination of drinking water by waste water during transmission reduces \nthe health impact of significant investments in water supply and sanitation infrastructure. There \nis a need to explore, from the urban local body perspective, gaps in the policy, legal, regulatory, \ninstitutional and investment aspects of food safety, hospital waste management and solid waste \nmanagement. An assessment should also be made of the effectiveness and appropriateness of \npublic-private partnerships and sustainable financing models for food safety, hospital waste and \nsolid waste management, as well as new models for effective implementation of such services. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  prepare  technical,  financial,  economic,  social  and \nenvironmental assessment reports for the proposed Bangladesh Urban Primary Health Care \nSector Development Program. The proposed program will include (i) a policy agenda; (ii) priority \ninvestments;  and  (iii)  a  component  for  institutional  strengthening  within  the  LGD,  city \ncorporations,  municipalities  and  partner  agencies.  The  TA  will  lay  the  groundwork  and \nnecessary preparation for the ensuing program, whose outcomes would be to improve the \nhealth status of the poor in urban areas and to assist Bangladesh in making progress on the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  in  relation  to  child  and  maternal  health  and \ncommunicable diseases. To achieve this impact, the TA will (i) assist in designing a program \nthat will increase access to urban primary health care; (ii) improve municipal public health \ngovernance,  including  improved  coordination  between  local  governments  and  the  health \nministry and developing the institutional and financial capacities of local government bodies to \nsustain efficient and effective primary health care services; and (iii) strengthen the capacity of \nurban local bodies to implement their mandates relating to food safety and hospital and solid \nwaste management in partnership with the private sector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will conduct a rapid evaluation of the UPHCP-II and assess the capacities of the \nmunicipalities and the project management unit to implement an expanded program through \ncontracting out to nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The TA also will examine the current \nUPHCP-II model and examine whether it should be modified to suit the needs of large district \nmunicipal headquarters to ensure cost-effectiveness and maximum value for the money spent. \n ", "4   \nThe need for large (50 bed) maternal and children\u2019s hospitals in existing and new areas also will \nbe examined. Alternative and innovative health financing modalities to increase the reach of the \nprogram to the urban poor, including food and cash vouchers for pregnant women, and very \npoor clients will be explored under the TA. \n \n11.  The TA will review institutional, policy, legal, regulatory and financial issues with regard \nto the ability of urban local bodies to execute their mandates on essential public health issues. \nThe TA also will compare the legal and regulatory frameworks relating to essential public health \nfunctions  of  urban  local  bodies  with  systems  in  middle-income  countries,  and  recommend \nprogram and policy reforms to strengthen the capacity of Bangladesh\u2019s urban local bodies to \nexecute essential public health functions. The TA will assess municipal public financing of \nessential public functions, and recommend mechanisms for the sustainable and increasing \ncontribution of municipal finances for essential public health functions. The TA will explore the \nrole that the private sector can play to strengthen the abilities of urban local bodies to execute \ntheir mandates on essential public health. \n \n12.  The TA will (i) examine the current status of food safety and hospital and solid waste \nmanagement with regard to urban local bodies; (ii) recommend a set of policy, legal and \nregulatory measures to strengthen urban local bodies to discharge their mandates effectively \nwith  regard  to  food  safety  and  solid  waste  and  hospital  waste  management;  (iii)  identify \ninvestment needs to strengthen food safety and hospital and solid waste management; (iv) \nexamine the application of public-private partnership models, and assist in preparing required \ndocumentation to undertake solid waste management through such partnerships in selected city \ncorporations and large municipal towns; and  (v)  assess the social and poverty impact of \nproposed interventions, and recommend measures to maximize the impact in reducing poverty,  \nmitigate impacts that might increase vulnerability of the marginalized population, and ensure \nthat the interventions are gender-sensitive and support women\u2019s empowerment. The TA also \nwill  examine  the  impact  of  the  proposed  interventions  on  indigenous  people,  potential \nresettlement issues and environmental impacts (Appendix 2). It will prepare necessary reports \nwith comprehensive safeguard measures to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. The need for \nan environmental assessment of the policy matrix will be identified once the scope of the policy \nreform loan is clear.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $815,000 equivalent. Of this, $650,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will provide $165,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office accommodation, \ntransport and administration support. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown \nin Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n D.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  LGD.  A  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished, to be chaired by the LGD secretary and including representatives of the Ministry of \nHealth and Family Welfare, the Economic Relations Department, the Planning Commission, the \nEstablishment  Department,  the  Environment  and  Forest  Department,  city  corporations, \nmunicipalities, NGOs, development partners and civil society. The steering committee will guide \nand  coordinate  the  TA  through  monthly  meetings.  A  program  coordination  unit  will  be \nestablished in the LGD to coordinate the TA, including liaison with stakeholders, data collection \n ", "  5\nand  analysis,  support  of  consultants,  provision  of  logistic  support,  and  organization  of \nworkshops. The UPHCP-II project director will be the TA program coordinator, assisted by a full-\ntime planning officer of the LGD, two counterparts (part-time) and two assistants (part-time).  \n \n15.  The TA will be executed in two phases. The first phase of implementation will require 58 \nperson-months (10 international and 48 national) of consulting services. The indicative terms of \nreference are in Appendix 4. The two international consultants will be (i) a municipal public  \nhealth governance and institutional development specialist and team leader (7 person-months) \nand (ii) a specialist on solid waste management and public-private partnerships (3 person-\nmonths). The 48 months of national consultants will include (i) an urban public health and \nmanagement  specialist  and  deputy  team  leader  (7  person-months),  (ii)  a  municipal  public \nfinance specialist (5 person-months), (iii) a health economist (5 person-months), (iv) a food \nsafety specialist (4 person-months), (v) a hospital waste management specialist (4 person-\nmonths), (vi) an infrastructure specialist (5 person-months), (vii) an evaluation specialist (5 \nperson-months), (viii) a poverty and social assessment specialist (4 person-months), (ix) a \nresettlement specialist (3 person-months), (x) an environmental specialist (4 person-months), \nand (xi) a legal counsel (2 person-months). The remaining consulting services for the second \nphase (17 person-months) of implementation will be identified at the time of the fact-finding \nmission,  and  will  be  used  to  bridge  technical  support  and  undertake  advance  actions  to \naccelerate  implementation  of  the  proposed  program.  ADB  will  engage  a  combination  of  a \nconsulting firm for the first phase and individual consultants for the second phase in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Quality \nand cost-based selection and a full technical proposal will be used to select the consultant firm. \nMinor equipment and office supplies will be procured under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to time). All equipment purchased \nunder  the TA  will  be handed  to  the  Government  when  the  TA  is  completed.  To  facilitate \nimplementation, the TA will use an advance-payment facility for training, seminars, conferences \nand surveys. The amount of the advance and its liquidation will be arranged in line with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grant. \n \n 16.  The TA will be implemented over 10 months from March 2008 to December 2008, \nincluding the bridging technical assistance for advance actions. The consultant team will submit \nan inception report within a month of the TA starting, a preliminary report of the situation \nanalysis and initial policy matrix within three months, the draft final report within six months, and \nthe final report within seven months. The Government and ADB will comment on the draft final \nreport. The TA will include workshops, stakeholder mapping and institutional mapping. It will \nemploy  participatory  methods  to  ensure  consultation  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders, \nincluding civil society, NGOs, and political and administrative leaders at various levels. The \nconsultants will organize at least four workshops to solicit views, discuss recommendations and \noptions, and conduct activities with stakeholders.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on grant basis to the \nGovernment of Bangladesh to be financed by the Japan Special Fund for preparing the Urban \nPrimary Health Care Sector Development Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources /  Assumptions \nIndicators / Targets  Monitoring  and Risks  \nMechanisms \nImpact (potential program)      Assumptions \nImprove health, nutrition, and population  By 2015,a reduce  Household  Macroeconomic \nstatus of the urban poor  infant mortality  surveys  stability  \n  rates in the project   \narea from 62 to 18  Strong political \nper 1000 live births  commitment to \n   human \nBy 2015, reduce  development  \nmaternal mortality \nratio from 320 to \n179 per 100,000 \nbirths \nOutcome (potential program)      Assumption \nEstablish sustainable urban primary  Unit for urban  Independent  LGD is committed \nhealthcare system that expands its reach  health established  surveys  to urban public \nto the urban poor and executes essential  in the Local    health care \npublic health functions effectively in  Government  Review   \npartnership with the private sector  Division (LGD)  missions  Risk \n  with a mandate for    City corporations \n  public health,  Tripartite  and municipalities \n  urban primary  meeting  have other \n  health care and    competing \n  waste  Consultant\u2019s  interests and do \n  management  report  not allocate \n    resources to \n  City corporations  urban public \n  and municipalities  health care \n  strengthened with   \n  adequate technical \n  staff and financial \n  resources to \n  implement their \n  public health \n  mandate \n   \n  Improvement in \n  hospital waste \n  management by \n  20% from the base \n  line \n   \n  Improvement in \nOutcome (project preparatory  solid waste \ntechnical assistance)  management by \nDesign of a program that takes into  10% from \nconsideration (i) institutional  baseline, through \nstrengthening aspects; (ii) policy, legal,  public-private \nregulatory and enforcement aspects of  partnerships \nessential public health functions; (iii) an   \ninvestment component to expand urban   \nprimary healthcare, food safety, and solid   \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources /  Assumptions \nIndicators / Targets  Monitoring  and Risks  \nMechanisms \nwaste and hospital waste management;  Leads to an \nand (iv) aspects relating to coordination  effective program \nwith other ministries, donors and the  that is launched in \nprivate sector  2009 \nOutputs      Assumptions \nFormulate policy, legal, regulatory and  Inception report  Government  Continued LGD \nenforcement interventions to strengthen    steering  commitment to \nurban local bodies to implement essential  Mid-term situation  committee for  urban primary \npublic health functions within their  analysis  the technical  healthcare \nmandate    assistance (TA)   \n  Draft final report    Program \nFormulate institution and capacity    Review  manager is \ninterventions to mainstream urban  Final report  missions  effective in \nprimary health care provision in local      guiding the \ngovernments, including appropriate      consultants \ncoordination mechanisms with the  Discussions  during the design \nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare and  with  phase  \nhealth sector donors  government \n  counterparts \nFormulation of investment proposals to   \nexpand urban primary health care  Effective \nprovision through public-private  program design \npartnerships  unit \n   \nFormulate investment proposals to   \nstrengthen food safety and management \nof  solid waste and hospital waste, among \nother things, through public-private \npartnerships \n \nFormulate strategies for urban local \ngovernments to work with private sector \nhealth providers in urban areas to achieve \npublic health good, including innovative \npublic-private partnerships to achieve \nenvironmental health and hygiene \n \nExplore other innovative financing \nmechanisms to cater to the extremely \npoor, including vouchers, and community \ninsurance \n \nFormulate fiscal measures for sustainable \nfinancing of urban primary healthcare \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.

The poor pay a significant share of their income for health services. However, their health \nstatus is substantially lower than the national average, and their access to health services remains less \nthan desired. The extremely marginalized and poor from rural areas are migrating into urban areas in \nsearch of employment. This has led to an increase in the absolute number of poor in urban areas. The \nurban poor living in slums and squatters also have to deal with environmental hazards resulting from poor \nliving conditions, which is in addition to weak social networks. Bangladesh\u2019s health policy (2000) stressed \nthe need to expand health services in urban areas, especially for the poor. However, only 5.3% of \ngovernment expenditure relates to health, with most of it targeted at the rural poor. The health needs of \nthe urban poor are largely unmet by public interventions. The ensuing program will address many of the \nconcerns relating to primary health care for the urban poor by strengthening and expanding public health \nservices in urban areas. By targeting the urban poor, and by improving their health, the program will help \nto reduce poverty in Bangladesh.  \n \n \nB.

They include (i) a baseline survey and identification of the urban poor in project areas, \nmapping of the potential target population, and the introduction of entitlement cards; (ii) identification of \nconstraints faced by the urban poor in accessing health services; (iii) promotion of basic daily health \nservices in slums; (iv) community social mobilization activities to develop health awareness in slums; (v) \nsocial marketing to increase demand for health services among the poor living in slums; (vi) increasing the \nnumber of trained community organizers and health volunteers; (vii) facility-level health committees in \nslums and low-income urban areas for monitoring health services to the poor, and representation of the \npoor on the committees; (viii) involvement of ward commissioners and representatives of nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), civil society, and poor communities in monitoring health services to the poor; \n(ix) setting up targets for NGO outreach workers to mobilize the poor to access health services; (x) \nindependent monitoring to review access and quality of services to the poor; and (xi) an orientation \nprogram for all primary health care providers to increase poor people\u2019s understanding of health issues and \nplanning of health services for the poor.
