INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Management  System  and \nLegislative Mechanism of Nonprofit Organizations was included in the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) TA pipeline for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in the December 2010 country \nprogramming mission, responding to the government\u2019s request. Dialogue with the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Finance clarified the policy \nand  institutional  context,  and  priorities for  ADB  support.  Agreement  was  reached  with  the \ngovernment on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost and financing \narrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.1 \n \nII.      ISSUES \n2.  The nonprofit sector in the PRC started developing at the beginning of the successful \neconomic and social reform launched in 1978. As the political, economic and social environment \nevolved, awareness about the importance of social development increased, and the government \nexplored new approaches for the provision of social services and to address poverty issues. As \na result, the number of civil society organizations in the PRC increased dramatically, from 4,446 \nregistered organizations in 1988 to 414,614 in 2009.2 The government defines three types of \nnonprofit  organizations  (NPOs)  under  its  current  registration  system:  social  organizations, \nprivate  non-enterprise  units  (PNUs),  and  foundations,  which  are  commonly  referred  as \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n  \n3.  Social  organizations  are  officially  defined  as  NPOs  that  are  formed  voluntarily  by \nChinese  citizens  in  order  to  realize  the  shared  objectives  of  their  members,  carrying  out \nactivities in accordance with their charter.3 They may take the form of a charity organization, a \nfederation, an industrial association, a research institute, or an academic society. PNUs are \nofficially defined as nonprofit social service organizations that are using non-state-owned assets, \nwhich are formed by nonprofit government institutions, social organizations, social entities and \nindividual citizens.4 They may include nonprofit and privately run schools, hospitals, museums \nor scientific research institutes. Foundations are private organizations set up with funds donated \nby either domestic or overseas organizations or individuals5 to promote scientific research, \ncultural education, social welfare, environment protection, or poverty reduction.  \n \n4.  In addition to the growth in the number of NPOs, the capacity and scope of the activities \nand roles undertaken by NPOs and public institutions have expanded. In particular, during the \n2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the engagement and support from NPOs resulted in a better \nperception by the public of their functions. Under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015), \nNPOs are expected to play an increasing role in the provision of basic services. To that effect, a \nlarge number of public institutions may become legally registered as NPOs, which will require \nimproving their administration and public reporting system. In this process, it is necessary to \naddress the existing constraints hampering the development and impact of NPOs through the \nenhancement of their management systems and legislative safeguards. \n \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 June 2011.  \n2 According to the PRC Ministry of Civil Affairs.  \n3 Regulations on the Registration and Administration of Social Organizations, 1998. \n4 Regulations on the Registration and Administration of Private Non-Enterprise Units, 1998. \n5 Regulations on the Administration of Foundations, 2004. \n   ", "2   \n5.  While three sets of regulations6 establish the current legal framework for NPOs in the \nPRC, there is room to further enhance the capacity of NPOs to provide social services and \nfoster inclusive growth by: (i) strengthening standards, safeguard requirements, and the scope \nof responsibility; (ii) establishing mechanisms to enforce the rights and obligations of NPOs, in \nparticular  registration  and  compliance  with  the  law;  and  (iii)  reinforcing  accountability, \nmanagement and monitoring systems.  \n \n6.  More specifically, due to the weakness of the legal framework governing their operations, \nNPOs are required to seek a government department as a sponsor and supervisor prior to their \nregistration with the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) or other designated central  and local \nregistration authorities, depending on the nature of the NPO. As it is often difficult to locate a \nsponsor, NPOs frequently operate without legal registration, and the number of operating NPOs \nis thus estimated to be significantly larger than that of registered NPOs. As non-registered \nNPOs operate without a legal status, they are largely unaware of their rights and obligations, \nincluding those related to taxation. In addition, there are restrictions on the number of NPOs that \ncan  intervene  in  a  specific  geographical  area  and  scope  (e.g.,  if  an  NPO  addressing \nenvironment protection is registered at the city level, no new organization for environmental \nprotection will be authorized to register in the city). \n \n7.  With regard to the branches of international NGOs or overseas foundations, while they \nmay register and be subject to national regulations, it would be necessary to develop specific \narrangements to integrate their respective overseas and domestic regulations.  \n \n8.  Establishment of a monitoring and supervision structure for NPOs should be a priority in \nthe context of increasing the positive contribution made by NPOs to the provision of services. In \naddition, the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) advocates that a greater role be played by \nNPOs in providing social services that foster inclusive growth and employment generation, and \nthereby contribute to poverty reduction. However, given the existing constraints, it is essential to \nenhance the capacity of NPO administrators and government officials to mobilize resources, \nadminister projects and funds, conduct safeguard assessments, and monitor and evaluate the \neffect of NPO participation on poverty reduction.  \n \n9.  The TA  directly  supports  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS) for the  PRC \n(2008\u20132010) and the anticipated priorities of the CPS now under preparation.7 The TA builds on \nthe findings of Nongovernment Organization-Government Partnerships in Village-Level Poverty \nAlleviation,8 in particular the successfully tested model for government services procurement \nfrom NGOs. The TA will also consider experiences and lessons regarding community-driven \ndevelopment  practices  reviewed  under  the  ongoing  East\u2013West  Partnerships  for  Poverty \nReduction.9 \n \n                                                \n6 Temporary Regulations on Registration and Administration of Civil Non-Business Institutions, 1998; Regulations on \nthe Administration of Social Organizations, 1998; and Regulations on the Administration of Foundations, 2004.  \n7\nADB. 2008.

Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved contribution of NPOs to poverty reduction and inclusive \ngrowth in the PRC. The outcome will be strengthened policy and regulatory framework for NPOs \nin the PRC. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have three main outputs and diverse deliverables as specified below. First, \nthe TA will produce a research report and a series of policy recommendations focusing on four \nareas: (i) identifying challenges and options to support the development of NPOs in the PRC; (ii) \nimproving the regulatory framework and legislative safeguards for NPOs, based on theoretical \nand practical analysis of international and domestic experience; (iii) revising the taxation system, \ninternal management mechanism and operational guidelines for NPOs; and (iv) establishing a \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to measure the contribution of NPOs to inclusive \ngrowth and social development. Policy recommendations will be drawn from: (i) an analysis of \nthe  current  domestic  experiences,  challenges  and  different  options  for  NPO  structures, \noperations, and accountability in the PRC, including in-depth assessment of selected pilot cases; \nand (ii) a review of relevant international NGO governance experience with lessons for the PRC. \n \n12.  Second, the TA will provide options for regulations and related systems of registration, \nreporting and oversight based on the first output and findings from the pilot cases. Key activities \ninclude:  (i)  an  overseas  study  visit  to  learn  from  successful  NPO  management  and  legal \nsystems; (ii) design, implementation and evaluation of a pilot program; and (iii) training sessions \nfor NPO administrators and government officials.  \n \n13.  Third,  the  TA  will  disseminate  research  findings  and  policy  suggestions  through \nseminars and the publication of a bilingual policy note.  Two national workshops (inception and \nmidterm) and one international seminar will be organized to discuss NPO policy; a bilingual \npolicy note will be compiled and disseminated among the NDRC, relevant government agencies \nand selected NPOs; and a final conference on findings and recommendations will be convened.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 equivalent. The government has requested ADB \nto finance $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will finance the balance of the \ncost,  equivalent  to  $200,000,  through  provision  of  office  space  and  equipment,  office \ncommunications,  remuneration  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. (See Appendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and financing plan.) \n \n15.  The cost estimate is based on engaging expert inputs equivalent to a total of 24 person-\nmonths of individual consulting services,10 including two international consultants for 5 person-\nmonths and four national consultants for a total of 19 person-months. The consultant team will \nbe responsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables in a timely and effective manner, \nand for organizing and carrying out all TA activities. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. TA support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, \n                                                \n10\n Given the nature of the expertise required, it is deemed more appropriate to engage individual consultants. \n   ", "4   \ntranslation, printing and copying, food and non-alcoholic beverages, transportation, lodging, \nlogistics and administrative support, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In \nline with standard ADB procedures, the TA will not support implementing agency management \nfees or related costs such as staff salaries and allowances and the use of implementing agency \nresources (such as office accommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart \ncontribution.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 26 months, from October 2011 to November 2013. The \nDepartment of Economic System Reform (DESR) of NDRC will be both the executing and \nimplementing agency for the TA. The DESR will be responsible for establishing and chairing a \nTA steering committee. The committee will be composed of representatives from MOCA, the \nMinistry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the State Council Leading Group for Poverty \nAlleviation and Development, the National Population and Family Planning Commission, the \nselected  pilot  program  localities,  and  other  government  agencies  concerned,  as  well  as \nrepresentatives of relevant NPOs, including the All-China Women\u2019s Federation. The steering \ncommittee will convene as needed, and be regularly consulted and invited to participate in TA \nactivities. \n \n17.  The  DESR  will  provide  a  suitably  furnished  office  with  computers,  utilities,  and \ntelecommunications access (including broadband internet connection), materials, maps, data \nand documents as required under the TA, and will cover the cost of office utilities for the \nconsultants. The DESR will also cover remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff. The \nDESR will designate a TA focal point with strong English speaking and writing skills, and \nfacilitate all TA activities and links to local government and providers to ensure the effective \nimplementation of the TA. \n \n18.   In consultation with the DESR, ADB will recruit national and international experts to \nprovide inputs as formal consultants, short-term resource persons, and task-specific experts. \nThe international and national consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis \nby ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). Individual consultants will be chosen based on their academic qualifications \nand relevant work experience. To facilitate implementation, ADB may establish an advance \nfacility for the DESR, and/or utilize direct payment (e.g., for workshop venues). The proceeds of \nthe TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement under the TA will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Management System and Legislative \nMechanism for Nonprofit Organizations and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n    ", "Appendix 1  5 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  and Indicators with  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nBaselines \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved contribution of  Number of registered  MOCA statistics  The government sustains its \nNPOs to poverty  NPOs effectively  commitment to NPO \nreduction and inclusive  delivering social services  development  \ngrowth in the PRC  increases to 80% by 2015   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened policy and  NPO registration  MOCA statistics  Revised management system \nregulatory framework for  increases by 100% by the    and legislative safeguard \nNPOs in the PRC  end of 2013  TA technical reports  recognized by NPOs \n       \nGovernment feedback  MOCA and other relevant \nand actions taken after  agencies support the \nsubmission of the policy  recommendations \nrecommendations   \nRisks \nNPOs resist reforming \noperational procedures \n  \nNDRC and/or MOCA reject the \nrecommendations \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
