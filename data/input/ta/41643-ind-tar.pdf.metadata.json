The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) objective, scope, implementation \narrangements, and financing plan were agreed between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand the Government of India (the Government) during missions fielded in March 2008 and July \n2008. The PPTA is designed to deepen partnership between ADB and the Government for \nmainstreaming public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) through an innovative project development \ncollaboration between ADB and the Government\u2019s India Infrastructure Project Development \nFund (IIPDF). The PPTA is in line with (i) ADB\u2019s country strategy, (ii) ADB\u2019s long term strategic \nframework  (Strategy  2020) 1 expectation  for  greater  ADB  involvement  in  private  sector \ndevelopment, and (iii) the promotion of new financing instruments and modalities (FIMs)2 under \nthe innovation and efficiency initiative.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Significant Infrastructure Investment Requirements. While the Indian economy has \nachieved an average real annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8.7%5 during \nFY2003\u2013FY2007, sustaining this growth trajectory with a rising population requires massive \ninvestments in infrastructure. The Planning Commission of India (PCI) has observed that poor \ninfrastructure is India\u2019s \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d, with an estimated cost of 3%\u22124% of lost GDP a year. \nPCI estimates a need to increase infrastructure spending from 4.7% to 8.0% of GDP to sustain \ngrowth and poverty alleviation targets. This translates into a $500 billion investment requirement \nacross sectors (including airports, ports, power, railways, transport, telecoms, and urban) during \nthe period 2007\u20132012. \n \n3.  Public  Sector  Constraints.  The  ability  of  the  public  sector  to  meet  the  above \nrequirements, including from sovereign guaranteed funds raised through multilateral agencies, \nis constrained by a high public debt level that averaged 81.5% of GDP from 2002 to 2008.6 \nFurther public sector financing, already limited by the deficit reduction provisions of the Fiscal \nResponsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003,7 is also constrained by continued commodity \nsubsidies. Unfavorable global economic conditions may further widen the fiscal deficit8 and, as \na result, limit public infrastructure spending.  \n \n4.  Need  for  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships.  PCI  has  highlighted  the  need  for  private \ninvestment for bridging infrastructure investment deficits. However, against an estimated 29% of \ntotal requirements for 2007\u20132012, or about $145 billion expected from the private sector, the \nshare of private sector investment in infrastructure has been less than 1% of GDP or about \n$9 billion on average per annum (2002\u20132007).9 While government initiatives have spurred \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

ADB Assistance. Two advisory technical assistance (ADTA)10 projects have assisted \nthe mainstreaming of PPPs through creating and strengthening PPP cells11 for (i) capacity \ndevelopment and (ii) institutionalizing PPP skills.12 Implementation coordination and technical \nadvice for mainstreaming of PPPs nationwide (provided by the PPP cell at the Department of \nEconomic Affairs [DEA], Ministry of Finance), along with ongoing government efforts, have \ngenerated significant interest among the states in pursuing PPPs as a preferred infrastructure \ndevelopment modality.  The growing capacity to identify, conceptualize, and manage PPPs \nacross the country is reflected in the identification of 80 potential PPP projects (the projects).13 \nThis has led to increasing demand for ADB support for project development and structuring, and \npossible  financing  across  the  infrastructure  sectors  and  subsectors  including  water,  urban \ntransport, and social.  \n \n6.  Indian  Infrastructure  Project  Development  Fund.  As  part  of  the  overall  PPP \ndevelopment framework, the Government established the IIPDF in July 2007 with an initial \ncontribution of $25 million equivalent. Managed by DEA, the IIPDF supports up to 75% of costs \nfor developing14 potential PPP projects through an advisory panel of pre-qualified transaction \nexperts. The IIPDF is open to access by all central government and state government agencies \nthat  are  willing  to  abide  by  specified  criteria.15  The  IIPDF  may  be  replenished  through \nsuccessfully bid out projects and further potential central government budgetary support. \n \n7.  Constraints in Project Development. While developing the potential PPP projects for \nsuccessful bid and financial closures is a natural progression in mainstreaming PPPs, these \nprojects are largely in sectors (urban water supply, health, and education) with little up-front \nprivate sector financing interest. Notwithstanding the IIPDF, developing the projects requires \n(i) in-depth  knowledge  of  infrastructure  sector  reforms;  (ii)  exposure  to  international  best \npractices and innovations in financial structuring; and (iii) the need for an effective and credible \ninterface  between  the  project  sponsors  (central  and  state  government  ministries  and \ndepartments, public sector undertakings, and other statutory authorities), private sector, and \nend users. At the current stage of mainstreaming PPPs, the convergence of these have proven \nto be difficult since PPP and infrastructure related reforms are still evolving in many states. \n \n8.  In this context, the Government has requested ADB support for developing the projects \nin partnership with the IIPDF. The Government\u2019s request is in recognition of ADB\u2019s ongoing \nsupport for mainstreaming PPPs, sector knowledge, financial structuring skills, and the ability to \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2006.

Currently, \nPPP cells are operating in 15 states and 6 central line ministries.  \n12  Capacity development includes developing training needs, management information systems, guidelines and \nmanuals, project preparation and appraisal skills, knowledge and awareness of international best practices. \nInstitutionalizing PPP skills includes improving the PPP policy and regulatory frameworks, compliance/public safety \nnorms, management information systems, bid documents and procedures, risk-sharing structures, and adequate \nmonitoring arrangements. \n13  Available on www.pppinindia.com. This list is subject to periodic updates.  \n14  \u201cDeveloping\u201d refers to all steps for detailed structuring of a project\u2019s institutional, financial, commercial, legal, \nenvironmental, and technical aspects\u2014including a competitive bid process to attract private sector participation. \n15  IIPDF criteria include (i) eligibility of sector, (ii) project ability to create a public asset, (iii) adequate project ring-\nfencing, (iv) ability to attract private sector, and (v) projected service delivery outcomes.  \n ", "  3\napply  new  FIMs  as  needed.  The  Government\u2019s  emphasis  is  primarily  on  development, \nstructuring, and facilitating the bidding of the projects (\u201cdeveloping projects\u201d) rather than ADB \nfinancing of the projects. The ADB-IIPDF partnership will enable the development of a broader \nrange of projects for a wider impact on mainstreaming PPPs. Once developed, the projects will \nhave a demonstration effect for the relevant sectors.  \n \n9.  The  ADB-IIPDF  partnership  will  play  a  crucial  developmental  role  in  reducing  risk \nperception, catalyzing private16 and commercial cofinancing, improving lending costs and tenors, \nand promoting equitable outreach of infrastructure services. Policy and institutional reforms \nundertaken  during  project  development  will  enable  further  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure service provision. If required and requested, the application of FIMs, especially \nnonsovereign lending (NSL) 17 for financing the projects, will be considered by ADB subject to \navailability  of  resources  for  catalyzing  further  reforms  as  well  as  private  and  commercial \ncofinancing. This approach complements the Government\u2019s emphasis on catalyzing domestic \nand international private sector sources for bridging infrastructure financing deficits, and is in \nperfect congruence with Strategy 2020 expectations for greater ADB involvement in private \nsector development and the marked emphasis on PPPs. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  PPTA  will  support  the  Government  in  developing  including  structuring  and \nfacilitating the bidding of the projects. These projects will act as examples of bankable and \nreplicable PPP models with the ability to attract private sector and commercial financing. The \nPPTA impact will be through improvements in infrastructure coverage and service provision \nefficiencies,  as  a  result  of  increased  private  sector  involvement  in  infrastructure  provision, \nsustainability of operations, and increased utility efficiencies with a resultant conservation of \nnatural resources. \n \n11.  The  outcome  of  the  PPTA  includes  an  increase  in  the  number  of  commercially \nsustainable and bankable PPP infrastructure projects being offered to the private sector by \nvarious state governments, central line ministries, and other government agencies.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The PPTA focuses on the projects emerging from state governments and central line \nministries supported by ADB\u2019s ongoing ADTA projects (para. 5). Projects for PPTA support will \nbe selected based on the following criteria: (i) a PPP facilitating policy and institutional reforms \nagenda at the project sponsor (para. 7) level, (ii) needs-driven specific request for PPTA support \nfrom the project sponsors, (iii) replication potential for the project, (iv) potential for catalyzing \nprivate sector interest and commercial cofinancing, and (v) potential for environmental resource  \nconservation. \n \n13.  Co-Funding Support Modality. The PPTA will share the development cost with the \nIIPDF on a project-by-project basis in the ratio of 25% (ADB) to 75% (IIPDF). In addition, ADB, \n                                                 \n16  Initial ADB assessments confirm private sector interest in PPP projects which are well-structured with reasonable \nexpectations of possible financial returns from early PPP projects.  \n17  Provision of NSLs to government-owned special purpose PPP project vehicles that meet the required threshold for \nADB NSL support, adds a \u201cbankability\u201d assurance to a project and would catalyze further competitive financing, \nthus aiding a PPP project in achieving successful financial closure. \n ", "4   \nin consultation with the Government, may fund a larger proportion or the entire development \ncost for a specific project, if necessary.  \n \n14.  PPTA  Components.  A  project  development  consultants\u2019  team  (PDCT)  will  be \nspecifically engaged for a proposed project, and benchmarked for milestones. The PDCT is \nexpected to develop the proposed project in three distinct but interlinked stages.  \n \n(i)  Component  1:  Project  feasibility  review  and  PPP  options  development. \nViability and validity assessment of feasibility and/or prefeasibility reports for the \nproject will require overall assessment of PPP options with related analyses as \nfollows: (a) economic analysis, (b) project rationale, (c) project cost estimates, \n(d) technical design, (e) institutional analysis, (f) preliminary financial model and \nfinancing plan, and (g) evaluation of PPP options, culminating in a recommended \nPPP model.  \n(ii)  Component 2: Financial analysis and project structuring. Detailed structuring \nby the PDCT of the PPP model as agreed in component 1. Deliverables will \ninclude finalization of (a) technical design and related cost estimates; (b) financial \nmodeling and sustainability analysis; (c) institutional reform, legal issues, and \ncontract structure; (d) financing plan;18 (e) project risk analysis; (f) social and \nenvironmental impacts; (g) stakeholder consultations and potential bidder lists; \nand (h) detailed timelines for bid process.  \n(iii)  Component  3:  PPP  bid  process  management  and  transaction  and \ncontractual  documentation. The  PDCT  will undertake finalization of (a) bid \ndocuments  (request  for  qualification  and  request  for  proposal),  contractual \nagreements, and institutional reform clauses; (b) project pre-bid consultations; \n(c) bidder qualification and bid evaluation criteria; (d) monitoring and evaluation \nframeworks; (e) required due diligence documents for potential debt providers, \nincluding  ADB\u2019s  NSL  facility;19  (f)  an  online  \u201cproject  data  room\u201d;  and  (g) \nassistance  with  the  bid  process,  bid  evaluations,  and  contract  negotiations, \nexpected to lead to the award of the proposed project to a bidder.  \n \n15.  An inception report will lay out the work approach, timelines, and required approval \nstages for each proposed project within 2 weeks of the start of the PDCT engagement. An \ninterim project report will be submitted upon completion of component 1 and a draft final project \nreport upon completion of component 2. A final project report, including all documentation \nproduced for component 3, will be submitted upon the completion of the bidding process.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The cost of the PPTA is estimated at $8.2 million equivalent, of which $2.0 million \nequivalent  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government will provide $5.7 million equivalent from its IIPDF on a \nproject-by-project basis.20 Project sponsoring agencies will contribute $0.5 million in kind to \ncover project-specific office facilities, administrative support, and workshop facilitations. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n                                                 \n18  Including potentially from ADB\u2019s NSL facility for loan provision to government-owned entities such as special \npurpose vehicles being considered for private sector partnerships (not including the privatization modality). \n19  Any lending will require compliance with businesses processes, procedures, and safeguards.  \n20  IIPDF share of the development cost of a project will be channeled through the project sponsors. ADB share of the \ndevelopment cost of the same project will be directly to the PDCT. Details are in Supplementary Appendixes B\u2013E.  \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  DEA\u2019s PPP cell will be the PPTA Executing Agency (EA). A steering committee chaired \nby the joint secretary at DEA will be established with representatives from DEA\u2019s PPP cell, \nIIPDF,  and  ADB,21  to  meet  once  every  6  months  and  provide  oversight,  monitoring,  and \nguidance on PPTA issues and stakeholder grievances.22 A consultant will assist the EA with \noverall  PPTA  management.  Provision  will  also  be  made  for  independent  midterm  external \nreview  of  the  PPTA.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment, on overall PPTA implementation, is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n18.  Screening of Project Proposals. The projects will be screened23 by the EA based on a \nproject proposal application form24 submitted by the project sponsors. After EA and IIPDF \nevaluation and approvals, the project sponsor will enter into an agreement through a project-\nspecific MOU with ADB (proposed MOU clauses in Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n19.  Procurement. Procurement for engagement of a project-specific PDCT will be under an \nindefinite delivery contract facility involving pre-qualification and retention (without commitment) \nfor a 3-year period using consultants\u2019 qualification selection, and selection for indefinite delivery \ncontract  assignments  (IDCAs)  using  least-cost  selection  based  on  evaluation  of  a  biodata \ntechnical and financial proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). IDCAs will assist in taking a project from concept to bid \nclosure; and require multidisciplinary inputs on financial analysis, transaction structuring, and \nlegal,  technical  (engineering),  social,  and  environmental  aspects.  An  individual  consultant \nspecialized  in  IDCA  design  and  implementation  will  provide  initial  support  to  the  EA. \nDisbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2008, as amended from time to time), including the advance payment facility described therein. \n \n20.  Detailed implementation arrangements are in Supplementary Appendixes B\u2013E. Lump \nsum payments will be made per PDCT contract milestones, for which generic terms of reference \nare in Appendix 3. Project sponsors will be required to provide office space and furniture, and \nlogistical and administrative support. PPTA implementation will last 36 months, from November \n2008 to November 2011. The steering committee will disseminate PPTA results (6 months \nreview reports and project-specific review reports) while project evaluation results will be made \npublicly available on the ADB website. An initial poverty and social analysis assessment is in \nAppendix 4.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis to the Government of India for \npreparing the Public\u2013Private Partnerships Pilot Projects Initiative (Mainstreaming Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships). \n                                                 \n21  A representative from the private sector may also be included in the steering committee. \n22  A complaints and problem management process, especially on project selection issues, will be developed. \n23  In line with IIPDF criteria and those noted in para. 12. \n24  This can follow the existing format for the IIPDF applications, as can be viewed on www.pppinindia.com. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  Assumptions \n\u2022  Improvements in  \u2022  An increase in overall  \u2022  Reports, statistics, and  \u2022  Stable state and central \ninfrastructure coverage  investment in  surveys from state  government policies  \nand service provision  infrastructure from  governments and  \u2022  Sufficient fiscal \nefficiencies  4.7% of GDP per  central line ministries   allocations buoyed by \n  annum (2006 level) to  \u2022  Periodic reports from  economic growth \n  at least 6% of GDP per  the PCI and similar  \u2022  Continued commitment \n  annum on average, by  government reports on  to overall reform \n  2012  infrastructure  \u2022  Continued growth in \n  \u2022  At least a 3%  \u2022  ADB evaluations and  demand for infrastructure \n  improvement (from  indicators  services driven by a \n2006 levels) in sectoral  \u2022  TA review missions  growing economy  \n(water, transport,  and TA audit reports   \npower, social sectors,    Risks \netc.) indicators of  \u2022  Inadequate enabling \ncoverage and  environment deters \nefficiency of services  commercial investments \nby 2015 including  in infrastructure  \n(i) people per  \u2022  Time lags between \nconnection,  infrastructure provision \n(ii) nonrevenue water  and usage for economic \nlevels, (iii) energy  purposes \nefficiency levels,  \u2022  Adverse government \n(iv) unserved  legislation and fiscal \npopulation areas, and  constraints  \n(v) access to \naffordable public \ntransport  \n \nOutcomes    Assumptions \n\u2022  Increase in the number of  \u2022  Governmental  \u2022  Government reports  \u2022  Improving PPP enabling \ncommercially sustainable  agencies develop an  and publications  environment and \nand bankable PPP  average of 2 PPP  including annual  government capacity  \nprojects offered to the  projects per year per  budgets, statistics, and  \u2022  Strong political will and \nprivate sector by various  state for at least  review of PPPs  commitment of state \nstate governments,  10 states between  \u2022  PPP cell (Ministry of  governments and central \ncentral line ministries,  2012 and 2017  Finance) data  line ministries \nand related agencies   \u2022  Increase in the share  \u2022  Project MIS data and  \u2022  Strong willingness and \n  of commercial  progress reports  capacity of private sector \n  financing for  \u2022  ADB review missions  (both technically and \n  infrastructure projects    financially) to participate \nof at least 10% from  in the PPP projects \n2006 levels, by 2012  \u2022  Availability of commercial \n\u2022  Share of private sector  cofinancing for PPP \ninvestment in  projects \ninfrastructure   \nincreases by at least  Risks \n5% from 2006 levels  \u2022  Inconsistent commitment \nby 2012  across states and line \nministries, including from \nchanging political \nequations \n\u2022  Adverse international \neconomic environment \nreducing interest from the \ninternational private \nsector in Indian PPPs \n\u2022  Slower-than-anticipated \n ", "Appendix 1  7\n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \ngrowth of domestic \nprivate sector capable of \nbidding for PPP projects \n\u2022  Alternative investment \nopportunities driving \naway private sector from \ninfrastructure projects  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Timely selection of \n1.

Detailed Terms of Reference \n \n4.  Components and Deliverables. The three-component approach for a PDCT engaged \nfor a project will allow for clear and defined milestones (as per Table A3) to be achieved. The \nreview, discussion, and approvals of these milestones (by ADB, DEA, and the project sponsor)1 \nwill allow for a structured road map, with issues identified and dealt with in the early stages to \nfacilitate a successful bid award. The PDCT is expected to produce an inception report within 2 \nweeks from start of its engagement to lay out the work approach, timelines, required approval \nstages. The three components are defined as follows: \n(i)  Component  1:  Project  feasibility  review  and  PPP  options  development. \nViability and validity assessment of feasibility/prefeasibility reports for a project \nrequiring overall assessment of PPP options, with the following related analyses: \n(a)  economic  analysis,  (b)  project  rationale,  (c)  project  cost  estimates,  (d) \ntechnical design, (e) institutional analysis, (f) preliminary financial model and \nfinancing plan assumptions, and (g) evaluation of PPP options culminating in a \nrecommended PPP model. Based on this analysis, an interim project report will \nlay out a recommended PPP structure with the above outputs (component 1 is \nexpected to take 2 months, excluding any approvals). \n(ii)  Component 2: Financial analysis and project structuring. Detailed structuring \nby the PDCT of the agreed PPP model once approved by DEA, the project \nsponsor and ADB\u2014leading to finalization of (a) technical design and related cost \nestimates;  (b)  financial  modeling  and  sustainability  analysis;  (c)  institutional \nreform, legal issues, and contract structure; (d) financing plan2 and likely funding \nsources; (e) project risk analysis; (f) social and environmental impact studies; (g) \nstakeholder consultations, as appropriate, and a list of potential private sector \nbidders; and (h) detailed timelines for bid process.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nBased on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction, and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy \nof the partner country. \n \nInfrastructure  deficit  is  identified  as  a  key  constraint  to  economic  growth  by  the  Government  of  India  (the \nGovernment). Inadequate infrastructure is estimated to cost the country between 3%\u20134% of lost GDP growth, or about \n$20 billion per annum. PCI estimates that infrastructure spending needs to increase from 4.7% to 8% of GDP to \nenable the country to meet its growth and poverty alleviation targets. This is crucial, given the strong correlation \nbetween economic growth and poverty reduction in the last decade.a\n \nFurthermore, the link between infrastructure provision and expansion of public goods is essential to mitigate poverty \nand widen the opportunities for the poor. In India, the public sector\u2019s ability to fund the required infrastructure \ninvestments, estimated at $500 billion (2007\u20132012), is constrained by an unsustainable public debt level. To provide \npublic goods to a larger number of citizens, the Government has prioritized private sector investments through the \nmodality of PPPs.  \n \nWhile previous ADB assistance has led to improvements in awareness and capacity at Government as well as at the \nstate level to undertake PPP projects, this has not yet translated into an adequate number of actual PPP projects\u2014\nwith a resultant lag in private sector investment in infrastructure. Catalyzing significant volume of private sector \ninvestments requires in-depth knowledge of infrastructure sector reforms, exposures to international best practices in \ninfrastructure  financing  and  PPP  structures,  and  a  credible  interface  between  project  sponsors  (governmental \nagencies) and the private sector.  \n \nThis PPTA, with its underlying ADB-Government partnership, will thus play a crucial role in reducing risk perceptions, \ncatalyzing private investors and commercial financing, improving lending terms, and ultimately improving the coverage \nand reach of equitable infrastructure services. This is directly in line with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u2013\n2020  (Strategy  2020)b  expectation  of  greater  ADB  involvement  in  private  sector  development,  and  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s policies for encouraging private investment as a means of economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n             General Intervention   Individual or Household (TI-H)   Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs  \n           (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification.  \nEnsuing pilot PPP projects (the project) under the PPTA will be across infrastructure sectors for general \ninfrastructure improvements\u2014coverage, efficiency, and service delivery.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? N/A \n   \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence?  \n \nThe PPTA supports the engagement of consultants for social and environmental impacts analysis including \nThis  draft  is  for  consultation  purposes  only  and  does  not  necessarily  reflect  the  views  of  ADB\u2019s \nconducting surveys and analysis to decide on poverty impact and required interventions. \n  f G f C\n \n  \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \n \n3.  If general intervention, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross \nsubsidy, pro-poor governance, and pro-poor growth)?  \nThe PPTA will enable the development (structuring and facilitating of bidding) of the projects for expansion of \npublic infrastructure. The feasibility and analysis includes outreach of services as a key criteria. Thus, the \ndesign and development process of the projects will allow for improvements to the livelihoods of the poor, either \ndirectly or indirectly.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \n \nBased on existing information: \n \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project?                    \nThe expected beneficiaries are end users of the utilities (e.g., water supply, urban transport) for the projects to be \ndeveloped. The expansion of coverage of utilities and conservation of natural resources will benefit the poor and \nsocially excluded.  \n  \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?  \nEfforts will be made on a project-by-project basis to identify such needs.  \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them?  \nThe projects to be developed under the PPTA will ensure that services and benefits are accessible to all groups \nwith regard to efficiency and equity as far as possible.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nThe key stakeholders include the private sector, public sector agencies, end-users of utility services and \nregulatory institutions. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)?  \nExtensive stakeholder consultations will take place during the development of the projects. Wherever required \nand possible, workshops and community briefings will be undertaken on a project-by-project basis. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n \n   Information sharing       Consultation       Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared? \n \n            Yes           No    Please explain.  \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.
