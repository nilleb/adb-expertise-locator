INTRODUCTION \n1.  This capacity development technical assistance (TA) is designed to initiate work based \non the mutual understanding between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)1 in Law (SAARCLAW). In November 2013, ADB \nentered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SAARCLAW to collaborate on legal \nand judicial initiatives with the objective of assisting the broader development and economic \ngoals of the South Asia region. The MOU was executed (i) in support of ADB\u2019s strategic \npriorities, (ii) recognizing the constraints on sharing legal and judicial experiences in South Asia, \nand (iii) considering SAARCLAW\u2019s critical importance to the continued development of the rule \nof law and capacity building in the region. Following the signing of the MOU, the Office of the \nGeneral Counsel (OGC) fielded a mission to Nepal to meet with SAARCLAW executive council \nmembers to confirm the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, costs, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1.2 \n \n2.   This TA will assist SAARCLAW in achieving its objectives of facilitating improvement, \nharmonization, and use of legal resources in the development process as a whole, including \nsocioeconomic development, in South Asia. The TA will focus on institutional and capacity \ndevelopment, sharing of experiences in selected areas of mutual concern, and production and \ndissemination of knowledge products in the identified selected areas. This is also in response to \nthe clear demand for an initiative of this type from the judiciaries and legal professionals in the \nregion.  \n \n3.  SAARCLAW was established in 1991 as a regional apex body of SAARC, composed of \njudges,  lawyers,  law  academics,  and  other  stakeholders  in  South  Asia.  However,  despite \ncommon regional issues and similar legal systems and laws, SAARC member countries have \nnot been able to institutionalize a system of continuous sharing and learning from each other\u2019s \nunique context. This is because of a lack of legal and judicial exchanges, knowledge sharing, \nand clear opportunities for benefiting from each other\u2019s experiences.   \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation Strategy for South Asia, 2011\u20132015 identifies improvement \nof regional connectivity, strengthening regional energy cooperation, and facilitating cross-border \ntrade as the focus areas for ADB action under the strategy.3 In addition, ADB\u2019s Strategy 20204 \nand the recently concluded midterm review5 included regional cooperation and integration (RCI), \ngood governance and capacity development, and the provision of knowledge solutions as some \nof ADB\u2019s strategic focus areas. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Most of the countries in South Asia share common elements of legal traditions and \ncultures, and have adopted many modern laws and signed various international treaties. Yet the \n                                                \n1  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been actively pursuing regional cooperation \nthrough  a  number  of  joint  regional  projects,  meetings,  and  conferences,  focusing  on  both  economic  and \ndevelopment issues. Established in 1985, SAARC has been at the forefront of regional efforts to (i) improve the \nwelfare of the people of South Asia; (ii) accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development; (iii) \npromote and strengthen the collective self-reliance of South Asian countries; and (iv) improve and foster regional \ncooperation in local and international fora in matters of common interest. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2014.  \n3  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n \nconcept  of  rule-of-law  is  not  uniformly  embedded  and  inconsistencies  in  application  and \nimplementation of laws and regulations are pervasive. This has resulted in a lack of a common \nlegal framework for South Asia, despite the countries\u2019 many commonalities. In a number of \ncases, the gap between the adequacy of laws and the absence of implementation resides in ill-\nequipped judiciaries. Also, where there is an opportunity for regional dialogue and consensus, \nthere is a lack of any concrete follow-through action because of the absence of a permanent \noversight body. These circumstances impair growth in public confidence and investment and, \nultimately,  sustainable  development.  Considering  the  importance  that  rule-of-law,  efficient \nregulatory and judicial systems, and prompt disposal of disputes play in the context of any \ndevelopment activities, SAARCLAW was established. It was formed to disseminate information, \npromote cooperation and understanding of legal developments in the region, and develop law \nas an instrument of social change. \n \n6.   Since its establishment, SAARCLAW has taken a number of initiatives in South Asia to \nfill the gap in the shared understanding of the various areas of law. SAARCLAW and the \nperiodic SAARC chief justices\u2019 conferences have been successful in bridging the gap and \ndeveloping  a  common  understanding  on  the  various  areas  of  laws.  Previous  SAARCLAW \nconferences and events have deliberated upon issues such as good governance, human rights, \ntrade relations, gender issues and women\u2019s rights, environmental degradation, improvements in \nthe justice system, and judicial activism, among others. In addition, publications and knowledge \nproducts of SAARCLAW have influenced law and policy reform, examples of which are those on \nHIV, gender identity, and sexual orientation, which led to the enactment of a transgender law \nand recognition of transgender rights in Pakistan.  \n \n7.   There is, however, a need to transform SAARCLAW from its present function into an \nentity designed for knowledge sharing, capacity building, and the mutual advancement of legal \ndevelopment on a more formal, consistent, sustainable, and permanent basis. This is so that the \nactivities of members are organized in a more structured manner, with a well-considered focus \non thematic areas, and there is an assurance that any agreements and proposals for common \nregional action are followed through and implemented. These will in turn see SAARCLAW \ndevelop into a more vibrant and active organization able to (i) meet its ambitious objective and \nserve as the premiere regional legal organization in South Asia; and (ii) affect, influence, and \nshape policies and objectives both at the regional and national level.  \n \n8.  SAARCLAW has been able to attract the interest of senior judges and prominent lawyers. \nIts membership includes both past and current chief justices and judges of supreme courts and \nhigh courts of South Asia, as well as distinguished and internationally renowned members of the \nlegal  profession.  Occasionally,  this  membership  translates  into  support  through  generous \ndonations from its members and other benefactors. One example is the establishment of the M. \nK. Nambyar SAARCLAW Center for Advanced Legal Studies at the NALSAR University of Law \nin Hyderabad, India. Given this, SAARCLAW has the potential to positively and productively \ninfluence legal and judicial policies on areas affecting development activities in the region in \nfields such as trade, energy, and transportation.  \n \n9.  However, capacity constraints and, in some cases, cultural and political barriers exist, \nand these hamper both the growth of SAARCLAW as an organization and the development of a \ncommon understanding of law and jurisprudence in the region. Currently, SAARCLAW does not \nhave a permanent and sustainable secretariat which can act as (i) a repository of all past and \nproposed initiatives, advocacies, and agreements of the organization; (ii) a platform where \nmembership can be harnessed and increased; and (iii) an implementer and overseer of plans, \nprojects,  programs,  and  activities  agreed  upon  by  the  members,  both  at  the regional  and \n ", "3 \n \nnational level. In addition, its capacity and potential as a regional legal institution has not been \nfully studied. \n \n10.    ADB\u2019s engagement with SAARCLAW will facilitate greater understanding of legal and \nregulatory issues and strengthen regional cooperation towards resolving issues and barriers. \nThis will have a positive impact on the region\u2019s development and growth. In addition, ADB\u2019s \nsupport and involvement may provide the needed impetus to spur further support, cooperation, \nand collaboration from the judiciaries and members of the legal profession in South Asia. This \nwill also help link ADB\u2019s regional cooperation, operational priority and practice areas (i.e., trade, \nenergy, and transport) with the Law, Justice, and Development program of OGC by helping \nensure that the proper legal and regulatory frameworks are in place for these initiatives and \ndevelopment programs. Since focus of the TA is filling the legal and regulatory gaps in ADB\u2019s \nprojects and RCI work, OGC is the most suitable department to undertake this task. OGC will be \nin a better position to utilize resources of the institutions like SAARCLAW and to provide expert \nadvice on review of policies and laws. OGC working closely with the regional department will not \nonly result in a more comprehensive impact on regional integration work but will also align with \nthe \u201cONE ADB\u201d concept.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be that SAARCLAW is used as a premier regional platform \nfacilitating integrated and harmonized development of policies and laws for socioeconomic \ndevelopment in South Asia.  \n \n12.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  capacity  and knowledge  sharing for consistent  and \nharmonized use of legal resources in the development process of South Asia. The TA will result \nin a sustained and continuous analysis and study of regional issues from a legal perspective \nthrough the SAARCLAW secretariat.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will involve various activities in South Asia aimed at strengthening SAARCLAW\u2019s \ncapacity as a regional legal institution by ensuring consistency and permanence in its work and \ninitiatives. At the same time, the TA will engage in capacity development, development and \ndissemination of knowledge products on priority legal and judicial issues. This TA is designed to \nprovide legal support to ADB\u2019s RCI activities in South Asia, particularly those related to trade \nand transport facilitation, which require changes to national laws and regulations of participating \ncountries.  \n \n14.   Output  1:  Capacity  development  on  legal  and  regulatory  harmonization  for \nregional integration. The TA will support the conduct of a baseline study to (i) identify areas \nthat align with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities and require legal and regulatory harmonization for a \nregionally  integrated  development  process,  such  as  infrastructure,  energy,  transport,  trade \nfacilitation,  anti-money-laundering  issues,  and  the  environment;  (ii)  analyze  the  legal  and \nregulatory  situation  to  identify  issues  in  those  areas;  and  (iii)  support  for  negotiation  and \nfinalization of cross-border trade and transport facilitation arrangements between and among \nSAARC member countries. In collaboration with South Asia Regional Department, it will also \nsupport  the  establishment,  if  needed,  of  working  groups  on  identified  areas  consisting  of \nmembers from relevant ministries, regulatory bodies, and legal and judicial professions, and the \n ", "4   \n \nholding of regional consultations of the working groups.6 The TA will also support the organizing \nof regional conferences for the stakeholders from legal and regulatory bodies; government \ndepartments; and the legal, judicial, economic, and development sectors with the objective of \nsharing experiences and exchanging ideas from the region on priority areas and issues for \nidentifying solutions for regional integration in such areas. These activities will be organized in \nSAARC member countries in collaboration with SAARCLAW. The priority areas and issues will \nbe selected with a view to enhancing and supporting ADB\u2019s ongoing projects and activities \nunder RCI in South Asia, including trade and transport facilitation initiatives under the South \nAsia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program. \n \n15.  Output 2: Developing and disseminating knowledge products on priority legal and \nregulatory issues. The TA will support production and dissemination of knowledge products on \nidentified legal, regulatory, and judicial issues which will be of interest and benefit to the SAARC \nmember countries and have direct relevance to the ongoing ADB activities in the area. The \nfocus  of  knowledge  products  will  be  the  legal  and  regulatory  aspects  of  RCI  and  other \ndevelopment  issues  covered  by  the  regional  meetings,  conferences  and  ADB  operations \n(including, for example, the SAARC motor vehicle and railway agreements and associated \narrangements  at  the  bilateral  and  plurilateral  levels),  as  well  as  other  issues  which  are \ndetermined to be important for regional development. These knowledge products, which will \nform part of the SASEC knowledge portal, will explore common regional issues, policies, and \nlegislation that can jointly benefit all South Asian countries. It is expected that the knowledge \nproducts will be used for three purposes: (i) they will be good knowledge-enhancing tools for the \nregional stakeholders, (ii) they can be used as a baseline assessment for regional initiatives, \nand (iii) they can provide the analytical and legal underpinning for SASEC transport and trade \nfacilitation initiatives. These knowledge products can further be used for advocacy purposes \nwith the governments of the SAARC member countries, and for further research and analysis of \npriority issues and areas for the development of laws, regional agreements and policies, and \nshared and comprehensive common frameworks of action.  \n \n16.  Output 3: Institutional strengthening through a permanent secretariat. The TA will \nsupport capacity and institutional development of SAARCLAW as an independent body through \nan institutional capacity assessment of SAARCLAW and the establishment of a permanent \nsecretariat,  including  assistance  for  adequate  office  management  needs  (office,  furniture, \ncomputers,  and  other  office  equipment)  and  human  resource  needs  (through  time-bound \nconsultants who will assist with the management of activities under the TA). Financial and work \nprograms, as well as an operations and administration guide, may also be developed for the \nsecretariat. SAARCLAW is expected to sustain the secretariat after initial support from ADB with \nthe help of a country subscription program to be initiated from 2015 and with the financial \nsupport of a few other organizations and domestic partners. Through this secretariat, the aim is \nto ensure the continuity and implementation of ideas and recommendations put forward by \nSAARCLAW members, and to sustain the commitment of legal professionals in South Asia for \nthe development and growth of the region.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n                                                \n6  These legal working groups will also coordinate with already established technical working groups in South Asia, \nsuch as the SASEC Trade Facilitation and Transport Working Group, and the Energy Working Group, among \nothers.  \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA and OGC will serve as the focal point for \nADB. SAARCLAW will be the implementing agency and will work with ADB in organizing and \nhosting  the  regional  consultations  and  conferences,  producing  knowledge  products,  and \nimplementing its capacity development activities. SAARCLAW\u2019s executive council or the officials \nnominated by it will serve as the steering committee to organize the activities under the TA. The \nactual  contents  and  focus  of  the  consultations  and  conferences  will  be  developed  jointly \nbetween ADB and SAARCLAW, taking into consideration the strategic goals and priorities of \neach institution. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from January 2015 to December 2016. It will utilize 60 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  comprising  18  person-months  of  national  consultant \ninputs and 42 person-months of international consultant inputs. One national consultant will be \nrecruited for 18 person-months on an intermittent basis to facilitate implementation of outputs 1 \nand 2. One international consultant will be recruited for a total of 18 person-months to assist \nwith  the  implementation  of  output  3,  particularly  the  institutional  capacity  assessment  of \nSAARCLAW  and  the  establishment,  management,  and  operation  of  the  secretariat.  The \nremaining 2\u20133 international consultants will be recruited for 24 person-months intermittently to (i) \nconduct  the  baseline  study;  (ii)  identify  priority  areas  that  require  legal  and  regulatory \nharmonization and research and assist with the regional conferences and consultation meetings; \nand (iii) research and assist with the production of knowledge products, subsequent regional \nconferences,  and  further  consultation  meetings.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  using \nindividual consultants selection method following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time).7 All goods and equipment to be procured under the TA \nwill be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) \nand will be handed over to SAARCLAW at the conclusion of the TA. Disbursement under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening Legal Institutions and Enhancing Regional Cooperation in Law, Justice, and \nDevelopment in South Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n    \n \n                                                \n7 To reduce the administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, consulting services \nunder the TA will be engaged under output-based (lump-sum) contracts, where appropriate. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nIndicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nSAARCLAW is used  Enhanced understanding  Reports and capacity  Judiciaries and legal \nas a premier regional  and knowledge of policies  development materials  professionals in the \nplatform facilitating  and laws on selected  developed as a result of  region are interested \nintegrated and  priority issues, through  regional dialogues and  in and committed to \nharmonized  SAARCLAW initiatives by  consultations on selected  pursuing legal themes \ndevelopment of  2020, compared with the  priority issues   of common interest in \npolicies and laws for  2013\u20132014 baseline  South Asia \nsocioeconomic \n    Risk \ndevelopment in South \nAsia       Political and other \nconstraints among a \nfew SAARC member \ncountries affect \nprogress of the TA \nOutcome       \nPriority issues identified  Baseline study \nEnhanced capacity \nand analyzed  \nand knowledge   \nsharing for consistent  Legal and regulatory  Reports and proposals as \nand harmonized use  dialogue and policy  a result of regional \nof legal resources in  discussions among key  dialogues and \nthe development  stakeholders from South  consultations on selected \nprocess of South Asia  Asia on priority issues  priority issues \nconcluded with \nrecommendations, by \ncompletion of the TA  \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
