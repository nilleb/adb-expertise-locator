The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help prepare the Wuhan Wastewater \nand Storm-Water Management Project. The Fact-Finding Mission visited the project area in \nSeptember  2004; discussed technical and socioeconomic issues with representatives of the \ncentral, provincial, and municipal governments; and carried out an initial poverty and social \nassessment, and rapid environmental assessment. This paper is based on the understandings \nreached by the Government and mission on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost \nestimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s \nCountry Strategy and Program Update for 2005\u20132007.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Many cities in the PRC have undergone rapid growth and transformation over the last 2 \ndecades. Decentralization of fiscal and administrative authority in the early 1980s unleashed \nheavy investments in infrastructure. As rapid urban economic growth is expected to continue well \ninto the future, the pressure for future expansion of infrastructure would continue. In this context, \nthe Government has taken a more forceful position in support of environmental protection, which \nhas helped to direct extensive resources to environmental services such as wastewater and \nstorm-water management.  \n \n3.  Rapid  industrial  and  urban  growth  has  increased  the  concern  for  environmental \nsustainability. The Government has pursued an active policy of environmental protection since \nthe late 1980s, and with more force than with most other matters has largely delegated this role to \nlocal governments. The policy attention and industrial renovation have slowed the environmental \ndeterioration and, in many large cities, reversed it. Nevertheless, water pollution remains serious \nand is growing, due mainly to increasing wastewater from domestic and semi-urban sources. In \naddition, residential housing and commercial development exacerbate urban drainage problems \nby increasing the impermeable areas that produce urban runoff.  \n \n4.  While  much  remains  to  be  done,  especially  for  environmental  protection  and  urban \ndrainage,  the  extensive  urban  reconstruction  over  the  last  2  decades  has  alleviated  most \ninfrastructure deficiencies, while increasing the resource requirements to operate and maintain \nthe enlarged stock of infrastructure. At the same time, the ongoing downsizing of the Government \nand the state-owned enterprise sectors are constraining fiscal and quasi-fiscal resources. This \nbrings to the fore the issue of efficiency in infrastructure investment and utilization. An example of \ninefficiency includes wastewater treatment plants, which are not fully utilized due to lack of a \nsecondary  collection  sewer  network  or  operation  funds.  To  increase  the  efficiency  of \ninfrastructure, the Government has been promoting the restructuring of state-owned enterprises \ninto corporations, full cost recovery, and limited private participation in infrastructure. For healthy \ndevelopment and operation of market-based provision of infrastructure, adequate regulatory and \nplanning capacities must be developed; current capacity has been weakened by the transition to \na market economy and Government streamlining. \n \n5.  For new urban areas and small cities in the PRC, expansion of infrastructure and services \nremains a dominant issue. As a group, small cities, towns, and suburban areas have been \nexperiencing  much  faster  economic  and  demographic  growth  than  larger  cities,  and  their \ninfrastructure and services have not kept pace, partly because the current fiscal system of the \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 March 2004. \n ", "2  \nPRC allows little borrowing or redistribution of fiscal and technical resources. As a result, small \nurban areas face a serious and growing deficit in infrastructure, services, and environment. This \nimbalance between growth needs and supporting services, and between small and large urban \nareas, represents an inefficient allocation of resources and a growing threat to the environment. It \nalso presents a major equity issue, as most of the jobs to absorb rural surplus labor have been \ncreated in the small urban areas. \n \n6.  Wuhan is located in the east of Hubei Province in central PRC and is the provincial \ncapital. The Yangtze River enters the city from the southwest and the Han River joins the \nYangtze River coming from the west. The two rivers divide the city into three parts: Hankou, \nHanyang,  and  Wuchang.  The  city  has  seven  urban  districts  (Hangyan,  Hongshan,  Jiangan, \nJianhan,  Qiaokou,  Qingshan,  and  Wuchang)  and  six  suburban  districts  (Caidian,  Dongxihu, \nHannan, Huangpi, Jiangxia, and Xinzhou), with a total population of about 7.68 million. The area \nis generally flat with several lakes.    \n \n7.  Wuhan is located about halfway along the several thousand kilometers reach of the \nYangtze River. The Yangtze River is the largest river in the PRC and receives the largest volume \nof  wastewater.  Though  the  river  is  often  seen  as  having  a  high  assimilative  capacity,  the \ncumulative effect of the extensive point and nonpoint discharge is deteriorating water quality. \nEffects of the cumulative pollution are felt throughout downstream reaches and in the East China \nSea. The growing pollution belt along the river\u2019s banks in and near cities is evidence of localized \nnear-shore pollution. \n \n8.  Water quality in the Wuhan section of the Yangtze River has decreased over the last 15 \nyears. In the mid-1980s, water quality exceeded its designated standard. However, since the late \n1980s, water quality has deteriorated mainly because of the wastewater discharged from the city. \nIn  2002,  Wuhan\u2019s  wastewater  discharge  totaled  2.02  million  cubic  meters/day,  and  the  five \nexisting wastewater treatment plants can only treat 28% of the wastewater generated. To achieve \nsustainable  wastewater  management  and  protection  of  water  resources,  ADB  approved  the \nWuhan  Wastewater  Management  Project  (WWMP)  in  2003,  with  the  aim  of  increasing \nwastewater treatment capacity from 28% (60% after completion of an ongoing World Bank and \nother projects) to approximately 80% of generated wastewater.2 \n \n9.  Wuhan exhibits many key urban environmental issues facing major cities in the PRC \ntoday. The physical compactness of the central city and its limited fiscal resources, still largely \nbased  on  old  industries,  heighten  the  need  for  efficiency  in  infrastructure  investment  and \nutilization. Continued rapid development of suburban areas holds the key to the city\u2019s economic \nfuture, as well as equity and environment. Wuhan is undertaking a comprehensive wastewater \nmanagement program to collect and treat most of the wastewater generated in the city by 2010. \nThe program calls for adding several small and large wastewater treatment plants and associated \ncollection sewer networks.  \n \n10.  Wuhan is served by a mixture of storm-water, wastewater, and combined (sewage and \nstorm-water) sewer networks. It is currently in the process of completing its drainage network, \nand separating the storm-water and wastewater networks. The principles reflected in this exercise \ninclude (i) expanding the coverage and increasing the capacity of the sewers, especially in areas \ncurrently not served as well as in areas with increasing populations; (ii) reducing the polluted \ninitial runoffs during storms and the volume of sewage to be treated; and (iii) installing the trunk \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nmains  to  bring  sewage  to  the  wastewater  treatment  plants.  Similar  to  the  wastewater \nmanagement program, Wuhan is undertaking a comprehensive urban drainage and flood control \nprogram with a target year of 2010.  \n \n11.  Caidian is located 20 kilometers southwest of Wuhan municipality and is a suburban \ndistrict. In contrast to the large wastewater management investment program in the built-up area \nof the city, very little attention was paid or investment made in wastewater management in the \nsuburban areas of the municipality. The investment needs are enormous, but the financial and \ntechnical  capabilities  of  district  governments  are  often  inadequate,  making  this  the  most \nchallenging and important pollution control in Wuhan. Since Caidian has no wastewater treatment \nplant, untreated wastewater generated by the district is being directly discharged to the Han River \nand polluting the main drinking water source for Wuhan.  \n \n12.  As  a  part  of  the  wastewater  and  storm-water  management  programs,  the  Wuhan \nmunicipal  government  (WMG)  has  proposed  the  following  components  under  the  proposed \nProject for ADB financing: (i) wastewater and storm-water management improvement in western \nHankou,  including  rehabilitation  of  a  wastewater  collection  network  in  the  areas  of \nChangfengnanbeiyuan  and  Jichanghe;  construction  of  a  wastewater  collection  network  in \nDongxihu; expansion of the Hanxi wastewater treatment plant; and rehabilitation of a drainage \nsystem in the areas of Changfengnanbeiyuan and Jichanghe; (ii) drainage system improvement \nin the Yangsigang area in Hanyang; and (iii) wastewater management in Caidian, including a \nwastewater  treatment  plant  and  associated  collection  network.  Western  Hankou,  comprising \nmainly old and new residential areas, is undergoing rapid development and urgently requires \nrehabilitation  and/or  expansion  of  the  drainage  and  wastewater  networks.  Of  the  10  major \ndrainage systems in the city, rehabilitation and expansion of the three drainage systems has high \npriority. These systems have a serious problem of drainage and flooding control.  \n \n13.  Efficient and sustainable delivery of wastewater and storm-water management services \ndepends on the establishment of appropriate institutions to manage those services. Institutional \narrangements for wastewater and storm-water management in Wuhan are in different stages of \nevolution.  WMG  has  recently  established  a  city-owned  municipal  wastewater  company  for \nwastewater management services, and institutional reforms are currently carried out under the \nongoing  ADB  project,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  financial  autonomy,  integrated  wastewater \nmanagement, and managerial improvements. However, WMG is still responsible for storm-water \nmanagement services through its water bureau, relying on normal budgetary transfers to manage \nurban drainage and flood control. This institutional arrangement appears to risk the efficiency and \nsustainability of storm-water management and urban drainage services.   \n \n14.  The  proposed  Project  will  supplement  and  extend  the  wastewater  and  storm-water \nmanagement  program  of  the  city  by  addressing  four  issues.  The  first  is  the  high  risk  of \nunderutilization of the new capacity due to the insufficient collection network, which the proposed \nProject will augment. The second is the limited investment in urban drainage systems, which \nneed to be rehabilitated and/or restructured after separating wastewater from the systems. The \nproposed Project will rehabilitate and/or restructure the drainage systems in the selected urban \nareas. The third is the financing and institutional challenges facing the construction and operation \nof the drainage and flood control infrastructure. The proposed Project will support financial and \ninstitutional reforms for storm-water management. The fourth is that relatively less attention has \nbeen paid to the poor suburban districts, due to their financial constraints and weak technical \ncapability. The proposed Project will help the district government in Caidian plan, design, and \nconstruct the wastewater treatment plants and associated collection systems; and help establish \na model wastewater management system for the other suburban districts. \n \n ", "4  \n15.  One of ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the PRC is to enhance environmental improvement \nand natural resources protection. The proposed Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy. With \nthe completed and ongoing projects, the Project will improve living conditions and the health of \nthe people in Wuhan; enhance water quality of lakes and rivers in and downstream of the city; \nand promote sustainable long-term economic growth. In support of the strategy, related policy \ndialogue  will  continue  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  trans-jurisdictional  pollution  prevention  and \ncontrol,  (ii)  integrated  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater  management,  (iii)  regulatory \nenforcement and monitoring, (iv) solid waste management in the context of drainage system \nprotection, (v) enterprise reform and corporate governance, (vi) cost recovery and tariff reform, \nand (vii) private sector participation. \n \n16.  The World Bank and ADB have been involved in the wastewater management sector in \nWuhan. In 1995, the World Bank financed an urban environment project and is completing \nconstruction of four wastewater treatment plants and three associated collection systems3 of the \n13 planned wastewater management systems in the city. In 2003, ADB financed the WWMP, \ncovering three wastewater treatment plants and associated collection systems. Of the seven \nremaining wastewater management systems, three are in operation and four small systems are \nunder construction and/or at a planning stage. These projects are fully complementary and \nsupportive to the proposed Project. The WWMP financed similar components, but with more \nfocus on wastewater management in urban districts. The proposed Project will complement the \nwastewater  treatment  plant  being  financed  by  the  World  Bank  and  extend  wastewater \nmanagement services to the selected suburban districts. It will also complement the rehabilitation \nand/or restructuring of drainage systems in the priority urban districts. \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n17.  The  purpose  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  is  to  help  the  Government  prepare  an \ninvestment project for wastewater and storm-water management in Wuhan. The outputs will be a \nset of policy, institutional, and physical recommendations packaged as a project suitable for ADB \nfinancing. The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  The TA will cover a comprehensive review of the overall wastewater and storm-water \nmanagement programs for Wuhan to ensure that the three components proposed by WMG are \nproperly integrated into the overall programs. The TA will also assess the feasibility of these \ncomponents through a review of domestic feasibility studies, environmental impact assessment \nreports,  resettlement  plans,  and  related  studies.  The  TA  will  identify  policy  measures  and \ninstitutional  development  needs  that  will  improve  wastewater  and  storm-water  management \nservices; ensure financial sustainability; and identify the social dimensions to be incorporated in \nthe project design, including measures proposed to enhance social development and reduce \npoverty. The initial poverty and social assessment carried out during the mission for the proposed \ncomponents is in Appendix 2. Key TA activities will include field surveys, document review, data \nanalysis, workshops, and consultation with stakeholders, including government officials, project \nbeneficiaries, and affected people.   \n \n                                                 \n3 The World Bank cannot complete a wastewater collection system for one wastewater treatment plant due to the \nshortfalls in loan savings. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, comprising $450,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $450,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $700,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, and \n$250,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. The Government has agreed to provide the balance of local currency cost, \nequivalent  to  $200,000  for  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  furniture,  administrative  support \nservices, and logistics. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing project.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  WMG  will  be  the  project  Executing  Agency.  A  project  management  office  has  been \nestablished and the director of the Wuhan Construction Investment Office of WMG designated as \nits director. The project management office will be in charge of overall project coordination, and \nwill work closely with the consultants and ADB. The existing Project Leading Group for the \nongoing WWMP project\u2014comprising a vice mayor of WMG, representatives from the provincial \nFinance  Bureau,  municipal  Water  Bureau,  Planning  Commission,  Construction  Commission, \nFinance Bureau, Price Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, and related agencies\u2014will \nprovide overall guidance and support to the proposed Project.    \n \n21.  A  firm  of  international  consultants,  in  association  with  domestic  consultants,  will  be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and its \nBorrowers, based on the quality- and cost-based selection method and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The TA will require 41 person-\nmonths of consulting services consisting of 14 person-months of international consulting and 27 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \nwastewater  and/or  drainage  management,  environment,  social  analysis,  financial  analysis, \neconomic analysis, and institutional development. The domestic consultants will have expertise in \nengineering  services  (wastewater  and/or  drainage  management,  sewer  networks,  costing, \nmechanical, electrical, and instrumentation), environment, sociology, financial analysis, economic \nanalysis, and institutional development. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are \nin Appendix 4. Since the tasks and methodology are well defined, engagement of consultants will \nfollow the simplified technical proposal procedure. Equipment to be provided to the consultants \nunder the TA will be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, from May to October 2005. The consultants \nwill submit inception, interim, draft final, and final reports. The findings will be presented at interim \nand draft final workshops. Project Leading Group members; representatives of the Ministry of \nFinance, provincial and municipal governmental agencies, and local communities; and ADB staff \nwill participate in the workshops.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Wuhan Wastewater and Storm-\nWater Management Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators and    and Risks \nTargets \nGoal (long-term       \ndevelopment objective)       \n       \nImproved living conditions  Public satisfaction with the  Annual socioeconomic \nand strengthened natural  urban environment  surveys undertaken as part of \nresource management in  increases (To be  a project performance \nWuhan.   quantified when baseline  management system  \n  established.)   \n     \n  All relevant water bodies  Environmental monitoring \n  in Wuhan meet the water  data of local environmental \n  quality targets by 2010    protection bureau and State \n    Environmental Protection \n    Administration \n     \nPurpose (immediate      Assumptions: \ndevelopment objective)        \n       \nIncreased coverage of  Areas and population  Municipal wastewater  Industrial wastewater discharge \nurban wastewater and  served by the first and  company information system  is controlled and sewer \ndrainage systems.  second Hanxi wastewater  and environmental monitoring  connections are made. \n  treatment plants and the  reports   \n  Caidian wastewater     \n  treatment plant (To be     \n  quantified when baseline     \n  established.)     \n       \n  Water quality at the rivers  Progress reports prepared by  Increase in wastewater flows \n  and lakes in and  the Wuhan municipal  does not exceed demand \n  downstream of the city (To  government  estimates. \n  be quantified when     \n  baseline established.)

Review of Sector Development Plans \n \n1.  The consultants will analyze wastewater and/or storm-water management practice in the \ncity in the context of basinwide water resources management, including water supply, irrigation, \nand  drainage.  Reference  will  be  made  to  sewerage  master  plan,  drainage  master  plan, \nindustrial wastewater pollution control plan, and various feasibility studies, where these exist, \namong others. Based on the analysis, the consultants will recommend improvements to these \nplans, including policies and strategies for wastewater and/or storm-water management. The \nproposed Project will be evaluated in the context of these plans. Based on the evaluation, the \nconsultants will undertake technical, environmental, social, financial, economic, and institutional \nfeasibility studies of the Project. \n \nB.  Technical Aspects    \n \n2.  The consultants will undertake the following tasks: (i) Develop plans to connect existing \nsewers to future project treatment facilities and/or storm-water drainage systems, including \ncoordination and phasing schedules to complete the sewer network, and a financing strategy. \n(ii)  Estimate  wastewater  flows  and  plant  capacity  based  on  economic  forecasts  of  water \ndemand, including flexibility to accommodate future changes in flow rate. (iii) Confirm treatment \nprocess, including flexibility to accommodate future changes in treatment requirements, and \nsuitability  for  effective  treatment  of  pretreated  wastewater  discharged  by  industry,  sludge \ntreatment  and  disposal,  effluent  standards,  potential  for  effluent  reuse,  and  impact  of \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  on  water  quality  in  the  receiving  watercourses.
