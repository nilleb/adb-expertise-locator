Through  the  rehabilitation  of  public  and\ncommunity infrastructure, the Project will help to restore\nsocial  and  economic  activities  disrupted  by  the  floods,\nparticularly  in  village  reconstruction.  The  Project  will\nreduce  flooding  and  waterlogging  of  agricultural  land,\nbenefiting residents, and farmers in low-lying, flood-prone\nareas. Improved community water and sanitation facilities\nwill  help  reduce  risk  of  health-related  problems  and\nimprove quality of life. Aside from relieving human and\nsocietal distress, the Project will have significant economic\nbenefits. The civil works under the rural roads rehabilitation\ncomponents alone are expected to provide about 262,500\nperson-days of employment to local skilled and unskilled\nlabor.  The  Project  will  help  bring  the  farmlands  in  six\ndistricts back to productivity and allow people to regain\nemployment and to generate incomes of their own instead\nof  relying  on  Government  emergency  assistance.\nRehabilitation of vital infrastructure will allow resumption of\ncommunication links and economic activity disrupted by\nflood damage.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Southwest Flood Damage Rehabilitation\nProject, and (ii) a proposal for a change in scope, implementation arrangements, reallocation of\nloan proceeds, and reemployment of loan savings from ongoing projects in Bangladesh for\nrehabilitation of flood damage.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. During  late  September  and  early  October  2000  southwest  Bangladesh,  an  area\ncustomarily  not  flood-prone,  experienced  severe  flooding.  The  rapidity  and  magnitude  of\nfloodwaters affected an area quite unprepared for a disaster of these nature and caused widespread\ndamage to infrastructure, agriculture, community facilities, and personal property. The Government\nrequested emergency assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the rehabilitation\nof flood-damaged facilities. ADB responded promptly by fielding the Appraisal Mission during 30\nOctober-16 November.1 The objectives of the Mission were to (i) assess, together with the\nagencies concerned, the extent of flood damage and rehabilitation requirements in various\nsectors; (ii) determine what resources could be made available from ongoing projects; (iii)\nprepare a flood damage rehabilitation project to finance urgent rehabilitation requirements; and\n(iv) explore the possibility of establishing a community needs-based social fund that could be\nused to meet postdisaster rehabilitation requirements.\n3. The Mission met with officials of ministries and agencies concerned, representatives of\nexternal financing agencies, and national nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Bangladesh\nResident  Mission  staff  participated  in  a  multiagency  mission  that  included  various  United\nNations agencies, and bilateral and multilateral financing agencies. The Mission visited the\naffected areas to initiate a needs assessment survey and hold field discussions with affected\npersons, local governments, and NGOs. In preparing the Project, the Mission drew upon the\nfindings of the various assessment teams, NGO reports, Government estimates, and consultant\nassessments to develop a picture of the extent of damage and the rehabilitation requirements.\nThe Mission established the need for a new loan that together with savings from four ongoing\nprojects would meet the immediate needs for rehabilitation in five sectors, as well as provide\nfunds  for  socioeconomic  rehabilitation  through  a  fund  established  in  a  leading  NGO.  The\nMission\u2019s findings were presented in an aide memoire that was confirmed by the Government\nduring a wrap-up meeting held on 15 November 2000. A summary of ADB\u2019s assistance package\n(the Project and loan savings) for flood damage rehabilitation is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Floods in Bangladesh\n4. The  deltaic  nature  of  Bangladesh  makes  it  susceptible  to  frequent  flooding,  which\nreplenishes  soils,  but  varies  enormously  in  extent  and  severity.  The  Ganges  (known\ndownstream as the Jamuna), Brahmaputra, and Meghna are the three major rivers that cause\n                                                \n1 The  Mission  comprised  A.  Akanda,  Senior  Transport  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  S.W.  Handayani,  Social\nDevelopment Specialist; S. Hutaserani, Senior Economist; E. Ouano, Senior Environment Specialist; K.H. Ryu,\nProject Engineer; M. Noguchi, Counsel; and C. Vandenabeele, Counsel. The Mission benefited from the guidance\nof P. Suphaphiphat, Resident Representative, BRM, and the participation of BRM staff (J.R. Cahoon, J. Mahmood,\nO. Shrestha, M. Subroto, and K.H. Talukdar) and missions in the field led by H. Tucker, Forestry Specialist; and W.\nAzmin, Health Specialist. The Mission was assisted by H. Zillur Rahman, Poverty Reduction Specialist/Consultant.", "2\nmuch of the flooding during the monsoons. However, the catchment areas for monsoon rains\nare largely outside Bangladesh \u2014 in Bhutan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Nepal.\nOver the years, floods have increased in frequency and severity. The most recent major flood\nwas in 1998 in which 52 districts covering about 60 percent of the country were inundated over\nan 11-week period. The 2000 flood was unlike the 1987, 1988, and 1998 floods, which resulted\nfrom large inflows in the major rivers and covered extensive areas of Bangladesh.\n5. In late September 2000, extremely heavy rainfall \u2014 estimated at 1,700 millimeters (mm)\nover 5-7 days \u2014 was experienced in the upper catchment areas of West Bengal between\nHooghly  and  Nadia  districts,  causing  massive  overflows,  primarily  in  the  Bhagirathi  and\nMathabhanga rivers, that crossed into Bangladesh. The floodwaters from West Bengal entered\nthe country through the districts of Chuadanga, Jessore, Jhenaidah, and Meherpur, down to\nSatkhira. Heavy rainfall in southwest Bangladesh at about the same time exacerbated the\nsituation, spreading the floods to Kushtia, and parts of Magura. The total affected area was\nabout 3,300 square kilometers, and the total affected population about 2 million as shown in\nTable 1. Over 1 million had to be housed in temporary shelters. The floodwaters caused\nwidespread  damage  to  infrastructure  (roads,  water  management  and  drainage,  irrigation\nfacilities, schools, health centers), agriculture, community facilities (water supply and sanitation),\nand personal property.\nTable 1: Heavily Affected Areas and Population\n District Total Area Total Population Affected Area Affected Population\n(km 2) (km 2)\nChuadanga 1,170                920,000        702            400,000\nJessore 2,594             1,858,106        603            552,813\nJhenaidah 1,189             1,393,674        428            200,000\nKushtia 1,672             1,501,126        403            250,000\nMeherpur 620                498,189        403            250,000\nSatkhira 3,858             1,597,178        700            357,000\n   Total 11,103             7,768,273     3,239                    2,009,813\nkm 2   = square kilometer\nSource: Rapid United Nations InterAgency Needs Assessment in the Flood Affected Areas of Southwestern\nBangladesh. 9 October 2000. Preliminary estimates.\n6. By early October, the damage in the southwest area was estimated at: six districts\nseverely  affected,  2-3  million  persons  affected  with  1+  million  in  temporary  shelters,  and\n500,000 houses destroyed, and 230,000 partially damaged. Infrastructure damage included 66+\nhealth centers; 850+ schools; and 35+ growth center markets; 600 km of national, regional and\ntype-A, roads; 680 km type-B and rural roads; 246 km of embankments, 437 water control\nstructures, and 863 drainage canals; 800+ bridges and culverts on major and rural roads; and\n128 km of railways and 7 bridges. There were less than 50 fatalities. 154,000 hectares (ha) of\ncrops area was destroyed, and 103,000 ha of shrimp and fish farms.\n7. Unlike many parts of Bangladesh, the southwest region is generally not flood-prone as\n75 percent of the land is high and medium high. The last flood that local residents can recall\nwas over 60 years ago. Hence, the rapidity and magnitude of floodwaters affected an area quite\nunprepared for such a disaster. Over the years, the buildup of infrastructure (particularly east-\nwest  feeder  roads),  extensive  construction  of  shrimp-farm  embankments,  dilapidation  of\ndrainage facilities and water control structures, siltation in rivers and canals (many of which\nbegan dying several years ago), and lack of attention to drainage patterns has created a", "3\nsituation that has significantly slowed the recession of floodwaters. The waters continued to\ncover most areas even six weeks after the first onrush.\n8. The  populations  affected  by  the  waters  have  little  in  the  way  of  coping  strategies,\nparticularly the many who have lost their entire possessions and currently face a tenuous\nexistence in the relief camps. Those who managed to salvage a few possessions have had to\nresort to distress sales, particularly of livestock for which fodder and facilities were not available,\nto generate income. The evident immediate needs are for food, shelter, clothing, medicine, and\nsanitation facilities. In the medium term, agricultural rehabilitation will be a priority \u2014 crops\n(much of the aman standing crop has been destroyed, and the planting of winter boro will be\ndelayed), livestock, fisheries (particularly hatcheries), agroforestry, and homestead gardens.\nReconstruction of village facilities and housing \u2014 most houses in the area were of sun-dried\nmud that disintegrated in the flooding \u2014 will also be a priority, and financial resources in grants\nand microcredit will be needed.\nB. Impact of the 2000 Floods\n1. Macroeconomic Outlook\n9. In the aftermath of the 1998 floods, the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) in\nFY1999 slowed due to (i) disruptions of the production and transportation systems of the\nmanufacturing  sector  (including  the  export  sector);  (ii)  crop  damage  and  shortage  of  food\nsupplies; (iii) increased import of foodgrains; (iv) increased Government spending, fiscal deficits,\nand borrowing from the banking system to recoup the losses; and (v) increased inflation. As\nshown in Table 2, manufacturing growth in FY1999 dropped by almost half to 4.9 percent from\nthe preflood level of 8.3 percent in FY1998. Export growth decreased from 16.8 percent to 2.9\npercent between FY1998 and FY1999, while import growth increased from 5.1 percent to 6.6\npercent, thereby raising the current account deficit from 1.1 percent of GDP to 1.4 percent. At\nthe same time, foreign exchange reserves declined from $1.8 billion to $1.5 billion, equivalent to\nonly 2.3 months of imports. With greater need for rehabilitation, Government spending and,\nhence, the fiscal deficit increased from 13.3 and 4.1 percent of GDP in FY1998 to 13.8 and 4.8\npercent of GDP, in FY1999. The Government financed the deficit by borrowing from the banking\nsystem; this resulted in increases in money supply and inflation from 10.2 and 7 percent in\nFY1998 to 12.8 and 9 percent, in FY1999. Fortunately, the bumper harvest of boro (winter) rice\ncontributed significantly to avoid an economic downturn. Agriculture growth increased to 4.8\npercent in FY1999 compared with the preflood level of 3.2 percent.  The dampening effect of the\n1998 floods on overall economic growth was thus milder than it would have been, with a slight\ndecline to 4.9 percent in FY1999 as against the preflood level of 5.2 percent in FY1998.\n10. During FY2000, prior to the recent flooding in the southwestern region of the country,\noverall economic performance was satisfactory except for poor fiscal performance. Economic\ngrowth increased to 5.5 percent in FY2000, mainly because of the acceleration of agricultural\ngrowth to 6.4 percent in the same year.  Such acceleration also contributed to reducing inflation\nto 3.8 percent in FY2000. Manufacturing growth increased slightly to 5.6 percent in FY2000,\nwhereas service sector growth remained at around 6 percent. Export growth increased to 9\npercent in FY2000, while import growth increased slightly to 6.8 percent. However, due to high\nremittance growth of about 14 percent in FY2000, the current account deficit dropped to 1\npercent of GDP. Foreign exchange reserves remained at a low level of $1.5 billion\u2014equivalent\nto only 2.3 months of import. On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit increased to 6.1 percent of GDP\nin FY2000 due to high Government spending of 15.5 percent of GDP and low revenue collection\nof  8.9  percent  of  GDP.  With  greater  bank  borrowing  to  finance  the  deficit,  money  supply", "4\nincreased to 19 percent in FY2000. Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies could cause high\ninflationary pressure if the forthcoming crop production is much lower than expected.\nTable 2: Macroeconomic Indicators\nItem FY1998 FY1999 FY2000b FY2001c\nGDP Growth (percent, in constant prices)a 5.2        4.9        5.5        5.0\n     Agriculture 3.2        4.8        6.4        5.4\n     Manufacturing 8.3        4.9        5.6        7.0\n     Services 5.0        5.2        6.0        6.0\nTotal Revenue (percent of GDP) 9.3        9.0        8.9        9.0\nTotal Spending (percent of GDP) 13.3      13.8      15.5      16.0\nFiscal Surplus/Deficit (-) (percent of GDP) (4.1)       (4.8)       (6.1)       (6.0)\nMoney Supply (percent change) 10.2      12.8      19.0      16.0\nConsumer Prices (percent change, annual average) 7.0        9.0        3.8        5.0\nExport ($) Growth (percent change) 16.8        2.9        9.0        9.0\nImport ($) Growth (percent change) 5.1        6.6        6.8        5.5\nCurrent Account Surplus/Deficit (-) (percent of GDP) (1.1)       (1.4)       (1.0)       (1.3)\nForeign Exchange Reserves (billion $) 1.8        1.5        1.5        1.5\nMonths of Import 2.8        2.3        2.3        2.0\n   GDP  =  Gross Domestic Product\na\n      Based on the new national accounts series, with 1995/96 as base year.\nb\n      Staff estimates.\nc\n      Based on preliminary ADB and World Bank projections.\n   Sources: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, World Bank, and staff estimates.\n11. Unlike  the  nationwide  1998  floods,  the  recent  flooding  was  concentrated  in  the\nsouthwestern region of the country. Although the production of aman rice within the region was\nheavily destroyed, the impact of the recent floods on the country\u2019s overall agriculture sector in\nFY2001 is likely to be limited as the total foodgrains production is estimated to be sufficient to\nmeet the total requirement. The impact on the overall manufacturing sector in FY2001 is also\nexpected to be mild as the floods affected small-scale enterprises within the region. Although no\nshortage of food supplies is expected, and import of foodgrains on account of floods may not be\nneeded, upward pressure on the overall import bill is expected due to the recent oil price hike.\nOn the fiscal side, although the recent flood is unlikely to have significant effects on overall\nrevenue collection, Government spending and, hence, fiscal deficit as well as bank borrowing\nwill continue to be high in FY2001 to finance rehabilitation needs, in addition to preparation for\nthe forthcoming election. Coupled with the recent increase in oil prices, the resulting inflation in\nFY2001 is expected to be higher than that in FY2000.\n2. Roads and Rural Infrastructure\n12. The floods inundated about 60 percent of the land area in seven southwestern districts.\nDamage to the road network was extensive. Initially, various road links were under water and\nthe pavement structures became weaker as the duration of inundation increased. During this\ntime, the roads were still traversed by trucks and buses. Although the movement of vehicles\ncontributed significantly to the premature deterioration of pavement surfaces, the need to move\npeople and supplies could not be denied. The next phase of road damage occurred when the\nfloodwaters started to recede. As the water rushed to find convenient outlets, embankments\nwere scoured, abutments washed away, and many bridges and culverts damaged or destroyed.\nWith road transport to the southwest districts of the country completely cut off, relief efforts used", "5\nother transport means or longer land routes. In areas most affected by the floods, the social and\neconomic cost was high, and complete recovery will require repair or rehabilitation of the\ninfrastructure,  including  roads,  bridges,  and  culverts  damaged  by  the  floods.  Damage  is\nsignificant for about 600 kilometers (km) of roads, 1,213 km of embankment, and 800 bridges\nand culverts. In the reconstruction effort, it will be necessary not only to rehabilitate damaged\ninfrastructure, but also construct some bridges and culverts at places cut or breached to enable\ndrainage of floodwaters.\n3. Water Management and Drainage Facilities\n13. The  recent  floods  damaged  the  water  management  and  drainage  facilities  in  the\nsouthwest region. This infrastructure was originally designed to cope with normal floods, but\nwith the recent major flood, substantial parts of these facilities became overloaded and broke\ndown. The problem was aggravated because adequate routine maintenance had not been\nprovided in previous years to repair damage caused by small floods. Based on an assessment\nfor the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), over $46.0 million would be needed to\nrehabilitate BWDB infrastructure, including 246 km of flood control embankments, 865 km of\ndrainage canals, 437 water control structures (minor bridges and culverts), river bank protection\nwork, and other infrastructure.\n4. Foodgrains, Shrimp Farms, and Fishponds\n14. The Ministry of Food estimated the country\u2019s total rice and wheat production to be 24.31\nmillion tons (t) in FY2000, 0.6 million t below the FY2000 level. The original area planted to\naman rice was 5.9 million hectares (ha). With the loss of 0.15 million ha of the aman area from\nrecent flood, 5.75 million ha remains. Given the estimated aman yield of 1.73/ha, the total\nquantity of aman produced would be 9.9 million t while the total quantity lost would be 0.26\nmillion t. The estimated production of aus and boro rice, as well as wheat of 1.55, 11.02, and\n1.84 million t, respectively, the total foodgrain production for FY2001 would be 24.31 million t.\nAfter deducting 10 percent for seeds, feed, wastage, and damage, and including 1.2 million t of\nmaize, total foodgrain production would be 22.96 million t. This would approximately balance the\noverall  foodgrain  requirement  of  21.68  million  t  for  131  million  people  on  an  average\nrequirement basis (454 gm/capita/day). Food shortage does not appear to be a problem, the\nkey issues are the delivery of adequate food resources and the need to accelerate drainage and\nagricultural rehabilitation to ensure that the expected production for 2001 is achieved.\n15. At the affected area level, the unprecedented flood that started in the third week of\nSeptember engulfed six southwest districts, resulting in a complete loss of about 150,000 ha of\nstanding crops. The main crops \u2014 transplanted aman and horticulture \u2014 were submerged and\nfarmers had no means of protecting the seeds of rabi crops, mainly boro paddy, vegetables, and\nspices. The affected area is the early vegetable-producing region of the country. When the\nfloods struck, most of the vegetable crops (eggplant, country beans, cauliflower, cabbage,\ntomatoes, gourd) were at various stages of harvesting. The total production loss is about\n420,000 tons of rice and vegetables worth $83.64 million. About 130,000 hectares of aman\npaddy and 24,000 ha of summer vegetables were completely damaged. Among the horticultural\ncrops,  80-90  percent  of  papaya  plantations  and  70-80  percent  of  jackfruit  trees  (highly\nsusceptible to waterlogging) were destroyed. Homestead gardens, among the major sources of\nincome for resource-poor farm families headed primarily by women, were also extensively\ndevastated. Farmers in flooded areas keep seeds for the next cropping season. With over 90\npercent of seeds being farmer-saved, the sudden flooding destroyed most of the seedstocks.\nWith the five seed multiplication farms in the area heavily damaged, a seed crisis is foreseen.", "6\nThe seed multiplication farms need to be rehabilitated urgently to supply seeds to the affected\nfarms for the coming cropping season. Livestock losses were also substantial, primarily with\ndistress  sales  to  generate  income,  lack  of  fodder  (scarcity  of  rice  straw),  and  rapidly\ndeteriorating health of the animals. The loss of livestock represents not only a major asset loss,\nbut also constrains agricultural rehabilitation as the animals provide the draught power for the\nfields. The flood has affected not only the landowners who have lost their crops, but also many\nof the functionally landless who are dependent on agricultural employment during the harvesting\nseason.\n16. Information from satellite images indicates that approximately 8,600 ha (67 percent) of\nthe shrimp-farm area was lost due to the recent flood. However, as the floods came at the end\nof the harvesting season, the losses were not as high as anticipated with about 1,200 t valued at\nabout $5.0 million. About 4,300 t of whitefish worth over $2.6 million were also washed away.\nRehabilitation of shrimp-farm and fishpond infrastructure is estimated at over $9.0 million.\n5. Social Infrastructure\n17. The major health problems caused by the 2000 floods have been (i) communicable\ndiseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, acute respiratory infections, and skin diseases; (ii) those\nrelated to water contamination and poor sanitation. In the 34 affected upazilas, 66 health\ncenters were damaged.  During the floods, 524 treatment and relief centers were set up; 41,391\ncases of diarrhea were treated, 8,756 cases of acute respiratory infection, and 83,827 others.\nBy late October, fewer than 50 deaths had been reported, a remarkably low figure, attributable\nto timely emergency assistance.\n18. The major needs in the health sector were (i) rehabilitation of damaged health care\nfacilities; (ii) medicines and oral rehydration supplements, and (iii) health education materials.\nSanitation emerged as a major issue in the temporary relief shelters, particularly for women who\nhad little or no privacy and consequently suffered physiological problems.\n19. Being largely mud structures, over 500 primary schools were extensively damaged by\nthe floods. Some 350 secondary schools were also affected, but not necessarily structurally.\nThe resources provided by ADB\u2019s ongoing Secondary Education Sector Project2 for repair and\nreconstruction of secondary schools damaged by the 1998 flood will also be used to cover\ndamage  from  the  2000  flood.  The  World  Bank-financed  Primary  Education  Development\nProgram provides for the construction of new schools, and reconstruction and rehabilitation of\ndamaged primary schools.\nC. Disaster Response\n20. As the floods were unexpected and no early warning was given, particularly across\nborders, preparedness for the 2000 disaster was minimal. Emergency procedures set out in the\nStanding Orders on Disaster were initially applied slowly. Nonetheless, once initiated, resources\nwere soon mobilized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MODMR). Particularly\nnoteworthy was the response of the Bangladesh Army, local NGOs, and private firms and\nindividuals; they provided gruel kitchens, temporary shelters, and provisioning. The Association\nof Development Agencies in Bangladesh (ADAB), the apex NGO body, played a major role in\nmobilizing  resources  from  local  and  international  sources  \u2014  including  NGOs  such  as\nBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, Proshika, Grameen Bank, and OXFAM \u2014 and\n                                                \n2 Loan 1690-BAN(SF): Secondary Education Sector Project, for $60.0 million, approved on 22 June 1999.", "7\norganizing assistance through ADAB Chapters in the flood-affected areas. The Palli Karma\nSahayak Foundation (PKSF), an apex microcredit financing NGO, also prepared assessments\nand mobilized credit resources through its partner organizations (POs).\n21. Bangladesh  has  a  decentralized  system  for  disaster  management  in  which\nadministrative entities at various levels (national, district, upazila, and union) are mandated to\nplay a specific role during and after a disaster. Those roles are specified in the Standing Orders\non Disaster. The entire process is supported by groupings of disaster management committees\nat several levels. The system has not been fully implemented, especially in areas not perceived\nto be disaster prone, such as the southwest region of Bangladesh.\n22. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-supported disaster management,\ncapacity-building project has helped establish and strengthen the Disaster Management Bureau\nunder the MODMR. International disaster management institutions such as the Asian Disaster\nPreparedness Center have contributed to the project through comprehensive training programs.\nRecently,  UNDP  and  its  collaborating  partners  commissioned  the  formulation  of  the\nComprehensive Disaster Management Plan (CDMP) that provides the program framework for\nlong-term risk reduction. Disaster preparedness in the southwest region is a complex issue that\nwill have to be addressed across sectors and closely involve communities to lessen the impacts\nof future floods on human health, and loss of material possessions such as crops, livestock, and\nhousehold  equipment  and  furnishings.  Future  programs  should  address  (i)  warning  and\nmonitoring  systems,  (ii)  emergency  procedures,  (iii)  location  and  preliminary  design  of\nappropriate evacuation centers, (iv) security procedures for items abandoned and left in houses,\n(v) provision and access of facilities during and after floods, and (vi) relief and rehabilitation\nprocedures. Drainage of floodwaters is a major long-term issue that will have to be addressed in\nfuture projects \u2014 construction of proper drainage channels, bridges, and culverts; controls on\nshrimp-farm growth and infrastructure (particularly miniembankments that impede water flows);\nregional cooperation in exchange of river flow data; dredging of canals; and social mobilization\nto allow empowerment of water management systems to communities and local governments.\nD. Aid Coordination and External Assistance\n23. The response of the international community to the disaster in southwest Bangladesh\nwas quick, with relief operations initiated soon after the initial flood. Overall coordination was led\nby UNDP, and a postflood needs assessment mission was fielded during 26 October \u2013 2\nNovember led by the World Food Programme, comprising representatives from World Health\nOrganization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UNDP, and United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). ADB participated in that mission and fielded a separate poverty and\nneeds assessment mission to prepare a social fund. Aid coordination has been close, with\ncontinuous  exchange  of  data  and  reports,  and  several  multiagency  meetings;  a  local\nconsultative group meeting was held on 9 November.\n24. ADB\u2019s response to the emergency situation was immediate, with a reconnaissance-\nappraisal mission fielded only a few weeks after the floodwaters entered Bangladesh. The\nmission coordinated with other agencies in gathering data to prepare an emergency loan, with\nthe intention of submitting the loan proposal for approval within five weeks after appraisal.\n25. Information on commitments from other agencies immediately after appraisal indicate\nthat the World Bank will be providing about $12.0 million in rehabilitation funds for municipal\ninfrastructure and $8.0 million for major roads, both drawn from loan savings; World Food", "8\nProgramme, $30.0 million; Department for International Development, $2.7 million equivalent\nand UNICEF, $200,000.\nE. Lessons Learned\n26. ADB has provided emergency assistance to Bangladesh through seven loans,3 as well\nas through the reallocation of loan savings. Two projects have been postevaluated.4 A review of\nthe  project  performance  audit  reports,  and  organizational  experience  with  rehabilitation\nassistance  indicates  the  following  lessons:  (i)  ADB  must  prepare  rehabilitation  projects  as\nquickly as possible; (ii) projects should be limited to restoring facilities to substantially preflood\nlevels; (iii) implementation periods should be short and, to the extent possible, completed in one\nor two construction seasons; (iv) as project implementation places a heavy burden on EA staff,\na higher degree of consulting support and ADB supervision is needed during implementation,\n(v) efforts should be made to ensure that ADB\u2019s rapid response to disasters is matched by\nequally quick action on the part of the Government; (vi) beneficiary participation in project\npreparation and implementation must be increased, especially for the maintenance of facilities;\n(vii) environment and social aspects should be considered in project design; (viii) arrangements\nfor disbursement should give EAs quick and simple access to funds; (ix) objectives and scope\nneed  to  be  carefully  defined;  (x)  criteria  for  subproject  selection  should  permit  simple\nprioritization  of  subprojects,  and  short  implementation  periods;  and  (xi)  the  presence  of  a\nsteering committee chaired by senior civil servants has the positive effect of bringing together\nproject  directors  of  the  many  project  components,  as  well  as  expediting  decision-making\nprocesses and activities to be implemented.\n27. The flood factor featured prominently in a recent ADB-financed study,5 which observed\nthat the 1998 floods had policy implications for the institution. The study recommended that\nADB continue to support schemes that consider the flood factor in project design, and enhance\nefforts to ensure better disaster preparedness through a more people-centered approach to\nmanaging flood impact rehabilitation.\n28. Despite the complexity of works covering six sectors, 13 subsectors, eight EAs, and 75\npercent of the country area, the implementation of the 1998 Flood Damage Rehabilitation\nProject (footnote 3) has been successful. The project steering committee (PSC) continues to\nmeet on a monthly basis, complemented by periodic reviews by the ADB Bangladesh Resident\nMission, which administers the project. The project is scheduled to close in June 2001, and by\nNovember 2000, most works had been completed for an overall weighted progress of 92\npercent. Procurement problems hampered the progress of the component implemented by\nBangladesh Railways, which achieved 70 percent completion. The experience has pointed to\nthe need to (i) avoid a profusion of small contracts, particularly in urban and rural infrastructure\nworks, as supervision can be difficult; (ii) control the tendency of small contractors to bid far too\n                                                \n3 Loan 882-BAN(SF): Flood Rehabilitation Project, for $14.3 million, approved on 4 February 1988; Loan 892-\nBAN(SF): Flood Damage Restoration Project, for $40.0 million, approved on 30 June 1988; Loan 941-BAN(SF):\nFlood Damage (Rural Infrastructure) Project, for $40.0 million, approved on 22 December 1988; Loan 967-\nBAN(SF): Second Flood Damage Restoration Project, for $80.0 million, approved on 24 August 1989; Loan 1124-\nBAN(SF): Dhaka Integrated Flood Protection Project, for $91.5 million, approved on 21 November 1991; Loan\n1202-BAN(SF): Secondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection Project, for $55.0 million, approved on 3 December\n1992;  and  Loan  1666-BAN(SF): Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project,  for  $104.0  million,  approved  on  18\nDecember 1998.\n4  PEO466, October 1996.

For the proposed Project, processing has been rapid and involved collaboration with\ndevelopment partners Project implementation is proposed to be limited to two full construction\nseasons in addition to the remaining current season, and focuses on immediate rehabilitation\nworks. Simplified approval procedures have been agreed upon with the Government and will be\ncovenanted. Consulting inputs have been provided where appropriate. Detailed criteria have\nbeen  developed  for  subproject  selection.  In  developing  an  innovative  social  fund  concept,\nparticular  attention  was  paid  to  poverty  reduction  and  delivery  mechanisms  for  effective\noutreach to the poor.\nF. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy\n30. Consistent with the Government\u2019s medium-term development strategy, ADB\u2019s country\noperational  strategy  for  Bangladesh  identifies  poverty  reduction  as  its  overall  strategic\nobjective.6 This will be achieved by targeting four priority areas: promotion of faster private\nsector-led economic growth, creation of better development opportunities for the poor in rural\nand urban areas, human development, and environmental protection. The poverty reduction\nobjective  emphasized  in  the  strategy  was  amplified  in  the  recently  signed  Partnership\nAgreement on Poverty Reduction between ADB and the Government.7 The agreement sets long\nand medium-term goals based on the Government\u2019s vision and plans for poverty reduction \u2014\nboth the income and nonincome aspects. It also guides ADB\u2019s medium-term operations to\nsupport the Government\u2019s medium-term priorities through pro-poor growth, social development,\nand  good  governance.  To  make  growth  more  pro-poor,  the  strategy  is  to  adopt  an  area\napproach to focus assistance on areas with high concentrations of poverty.\n31. The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  country  operational  strategy  and  the  Partnership\nAgreement in that it will rehabilitate key physical and social infrastructure essential to restoring\nnormal levels of economic and social activities. This will, in turn, improve the poverty situation\naggravated  by  the  flood  damage.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to  clearing  up  the\nenvironmental damage caused by the floods. The incidence of poverty in most of the flood-\naffected  districts  in  the  region  varies  between  40-50  percent  compared  with  the  national\naverage of 44.7 percent. One of those districts, Kushtia, has a poverty incidence of over 50\npercent. However, in the postflood situation, poverty has reached alarming proportions owing to\nmassive income erosion, complete loss of physical assets, and debt accumulation. Timely\nassistance is critical to ensuring that the current poverty profile does not become a long-term\nfeature in southwest Bangladesh.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n32. The 2000 flood, not as extensive as earlier floods, was concentrated in southwest\nBangladesh, an area that customarily has been free of floods of significant magnitude. Hence,\nthe damage has been more severe to the population, infrastructure, crops, fish farms, shrimp\n                                                \n6  Asian Development Bank. 1999, Bangladesh Country Operational Strategy: Responding to the Challenge of\nPoverty.

Manila.", "10\nfarms,  and  enterprises  in  the  affected  area.  Rural  settlements  have  been  hardest  hit  as\ntraditional mud houses disintegrated with the flooding. The flood water are slow to recede as the\ninfrastructure network built up over many years of flood-free existence has affected drainage\nflows. Given the highly fertile nature and productive potential for production and export earnings,\nit is critical to resume economic activities as quickly as possible, particularly as the aman crop\nhas been lost and boro crop planting may be delayed. The cost of rehabilitation is high and\ndespite the overall economic health of the country, resources to cope with such a disaster are\nlimited. ADB assistance will avoid the need to divert resources for flood rehabilitation from other\nessential development programs.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n33. The principal objective of ADB assistance is to rehabilitate damage caused by the 2000\nfloods in the southwest region of Bangladesh, thereby enabling restoration of preflood levels of\neconomic and social activity. In developing an urgent response to the crisis, the project design\ntook account of the following: (i) scale and extent of flood damage; (ii) response of other relief\nagencies and external financing agencies; (iv) Government capacity to respond to the disaster;\n(v) impact of the floods on the poor, particularly given that the area was not flood-prone, (v)\nongoing ADB and other financing agency activities in different sectors in the areas to ensure\ncomplementarity  of  effort;  (vi)  response  of  civil  society;  and  (vii)  need  for  a  structured\ncommunity-based mechanism to deal with disasters. Particular note was taken of the need to (i)\nidentify areas in which rehabilitation would have a substantial impact on the economic and\nsocial welfare of communities, and (ii) innovative approaches to ensure that assistance reaches\nthe poor.\n34. Five areas were identified for ADB flood rehabilitation assistance (i) national, regional,\nand type-A feeder roads; (ii) type-B feeder roads, type-1 rural roads, and growth center markets;\n(iii) railways; (iv) water management and drainage facilities; (v) water supply and sanitation.\nFinancing for these sectors would be provided under a new project. Funds from ongoing ADB\nprojects were identified for use to supplement the new resources. Complementarity with the\nefforts of other external financing agencies will ensure that the use of resources is optimized. In\naddition to the sector-specific interventions, a focused, community-directed, NGO-managed\nsocial fund was determined to be an effective way to ensure that the economic rehabilitation\nneeds of affected communities, particularly the poor, would be addressed.\n35. Within each sector, priorities were established as follows: (i) first, to repair damage to\nongoing ADB-assisted projects for which financing was not available from current sources; (ii)\nsecond, to repair damage to completed ADB projects; (iii) third, to repair damage to non-ADB\nsubprojects in the relevant sector.\n36. Rehabilitation of damaged social infrastructure and urban facilities can be financed by\nongoing ADB projects in the education sector and the World Bank\u2019s Municipal Services Project.\nAssistance for the health sector can be provided as emergency relief and through the ongoing\n$3.5 billion Health and Population Sector Program, an assistance program designed to support\nthe Government\u2019s Health and Population Sector Strategy during 1998-2003. The program is\nsupported by the Government and consortium of assistance agencies, led by the World Bank,\nand including Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), DFID, European Community\n(EU),  France,  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), Netherlands,\nNorway,  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (SIDA),  UNDP,  United\nNations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), and UNICEF. Others supporting the strategy,", "11\nbut not members of the Health and Population Program consortium, are ADB through its Urban\nPrimary Health Care Project8 and United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\nthrough NGOs.\n37. The Project will rehabilitate flood-damaged facilities by providing civil works; equipment,\nand  materials;  and  consulting  services  for  project  design,  evaluation,  implementation,  and\nsupervision. The Project will follow a sector approach as the fastest and most appropriate\nresponse to an emergency situation, with subprojects selected during project implementation.\nThe sector approach allows rapid processing of the loan proposal in parallel with detailed\nassessment of requirements, and permits a flexible response within the selection criteria agreed\nupon with the Government. Subprojects will consist of a group of similar works, located in the\nsame geographic area that forms the most efficient unit for implementation. In each sector, the\nEA will identify eligible subprojects on the basis of general as well as sector-specific criteria. The\nProject will comprise six components:\n1. Part A:  National, Regional, and Type-A Feeder Roads\n38. This component, described in Appendix 2, will involve rehabilitation by the Roads and\nHighways Department (RHD) of flood-damaged national and regional roads to full serviceability\nlevels within seven districts: Chuadanga, Kushtia, Jessore, Jhenaidah, Magura, Meherpur, and\nSatkhira, and. One damaged road (Tala-Paikgacha) in Khulna District will also be rehabilitated.\nFor type-A feeder roads, the rehabilitation will be limited to Jessore, Jhenaidah, and Satkhira,\nwhich are the most severely affected areas. The component will include rehabilitation and\nconstruction  to  appropriate  standards  of  essential  bridges  and  culverts  in  road  sections\nbreached or cut to allow proper drainage of floodwaters. Construction supervision services for\ndetailed  damage  assessment,  subproject  preparation,  and  civil  works  supervision  will  be\nincluded.\n39. Design and construction of bridges and culverts should recognize the dynamics of the\nhydrological regime to ensure that appropriate drainage standards are applied. The design team\nshould coordinate with Bangladesh Water Development Board as required, and recognize local\ncustoms and practices in water management.\n2. Part B:  Rural Infrastructure\na. Part B1:  Roads, Structures, and Growth Center Markets\n40. The  component,  described  in  Appendix  3,  will  rehabilitate,  within  seven  districts\n(Chuadanga,  Kushtia,  Jessore,  Jhenaidah,  Magura  Meherpur,  Satkhira),  flood-damaged\ninfrastructure (type-B feeder roads, type-1 rural roads, structures on both types, and growth\ncenter markets) to operating conditions, including rehabilitation and construction to appropriate\nstandards of bridges and culverts in sections in which breaches or cuts were necessary for\ndrainage  of  floodwaters.  The  rehabilitation  will  also  include  growth  center  markets  and\ncommunity facilities within the jurisdiction of the Local Government Engineering Department\n(LGED).\n41. Design and construction of bridges and culverts should recognize the dynamics of the\nhydrological regime to ensure that appropriate drainage standards are applied. The design team\nshould coordinate with BWDB as required, and recognize local customs and practices in water\n                                                \n8 Loan 1538-BAN(SF): Urban Primary Health Care Project, for $40.0 million, approved on 16 September 1997.", "12\nmanagement. Construction supervision services for detailed damage assessment, subproject\npreparation, and civil works supervision will be included.\nb. Part B2:  Public Health Facilities\n42. The  component,  also  described  in  Appendix  3,  involves  the  rehabilitation  by  the\nDepartment of Public Health Engineering of water supply (tubewells, and upazila and district\nwater  supply  systems)  and  sanitation  facilities  in  the  seven  districts  of  the  southwest:\nChuadanga, Kushtia, Jessore, Jhenaidah, Magura, Meherpur, and Satkhira. It will include the\nprovision of water supply (tubewells) and sanitation (latrines) facilities at market centers and\nprimary schools that may serve as emergency shelters in the event of a future disaster.\n3. Part C:  Railways\n43. The  component,  described  in  Appendix  4,  will  involve  rehabilitation  by  Bangladesh\nRailway of flood-damaged infrastructure and related facilities along affected routes to the level\nof  service  required  to  ensure  regular  operations,  including  (i)  civil  works  to  restore\nembankments, tracks, essential buildings, station roads, and signaling and telecommunications\nfacilities; and (ii) the construction and reconstruction of critical bridges and culverts where the\nrailway embankment has been breached or drainage is essential. Design and construction of\nbridges and culverts should recognize the dynamics of the hydrological regime to ensure that\nappropriate drainage standards are applied. The design team should coordinate with BWDB as\nrequired, and recognize local customs and practices in water management. Owing to the limited\nimpact, construction supervision services will not be required.\n4. Part D:  Water Management and Drainage Facilities\n44. The component, described in Appendix 5, will involve rehabilitation by BWDB of flood-\ndamaged infrastructure and related facilities in the water resource management subsector,\ncovering sluice gates, embankments, water control structures, and drainage canals. Consulting\nservices required for assistance in procurement and construction supervision will be obtained by\ndirectly  engaging  qualified  consultants  with  experience  in  ADB-assisted  flood  damage\nrehabilitation projects. Works in other components that will have implications for drainage and\nfloodwater movement within the affected area will be required to liaise with BWDB to ensure\nthat designs are appropriate. BWDB will also consult with local communities to ensure that local\ncustoms and practices in water management are recognized in subproject designs.\n5. Part E:  Socioeconomic Rehabilitation Fund\n45. The concept of a social fund was developed to address the urgent needs of the poor and\ndisadvantaged in the affected areas. The fund would respond to community needs in village\nreconstruction, livelihood restoration, and other purposes that could be met through an effective\nmicrocredit  facility  that  would  build  on  the  resources  offered  through  emergency  relief\nassistance. Such a fund would thereby initiate a sustainable rehabilitation effort. The importance\nof microcredit in postflood reconstruction is highlighted in several publications.9\n                                                \n9 For example, S. Ahmed. 1998. Coping with Disaster in Bangladesh: PKSF Experience of Flood 1998 and\nMicrocredit, mimeo, Dhaka; S. Ahmed, 2000. Post-Flood Rehabilitation: Microcredit Requirements, 1998; Q.K.\nAhmed et al. November 2000. Perspectives on 1998 Flood, Dhaka.", "13\n46. The Project will support the creation of a socioeconomic rehabilitation fund (SRF), to\nmitigate the social and economic impact of floods and to improve the living conditions of the\npoor through speedy provision of loans for village reconstruction, primarily rehabilitation of\nhousing,  and  on-  and  off-farm  income-generating  activities.  The  SRF  will  strengthen\ndecentralized  delivery  mechanisms  by  supporting  local  (government  and  nongovernment)\norganizations that are responsive to local needs, and build institutional capacity at the local\nlevels.\n47. The scope of activities funded by the SRF will be based on beneficiary demand and the\nimplementation capacity of local NGOs. Community participation, demand orientation, and local\norganizational capacity will be used as guiding principles for SRF activities. These principles will\nbe reflected in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the SRF. NGO involvement,\nparticularly local NGOs, will enable the SRF to reach poor and isolated communities, enhance\ncommunity participation, and improve project design and implementation.\n48. PKSF, described in Appendix 6, is a highly regarded organization in microcredit-based\nincome generation schemes. It will be the apex microcredit organization for the SRF. PKSF is\nalso the apex institution under the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project (1996)\nand ADB\u2019s Participatory Livestock Development Project.10  Currently, PKSF has 182 partner\norganizations (POs) covering 61 of the 64 districts of Bangladesh. Starting with only 6,000\nbeneficiaries in 1990, the credit program covered 1.5 million beneficiaries in 1998; 90 percent\nare women. In 1999, the cumulative loan amount stood at Tk5,637.0 million, reflecting an\naverage annual growth rate of about 125 percent. PKSF\u2019s operating criteria are satisfactory to\nADB, with (i) an independent governing body, professional management and staff, and sound\noperating policies; (ii) reliable and transparent accounting practices, management information\nsystems, and internal audit systems; (iii) accounts audited by reputable external auditors on an\nannual  basis;  and  (iv)  a  loan  recovery  rate  of  98  percent  on  a  continuous  basis.  The\norganization  of  the  SRF  component  will  involve  close  coordination  between  PKSF,  local\ngovernments, and participating POs.\n49. All  POs  must  direct  SRF  resources  to  borrower  groups  of  the  poor.  The  first-time\nbeneficiaries of the POs will be persons who fulfill the following eligibility criteria, as usually\napplied by PKSF, or other criteria as agreed between PKSF and the POs from time to time: (i)\nare a permanent resident in the project area; (ii) have total assets not exceeding the value of 0.4\nha of arable land in their locality; and (iii) are members of a savings group organized and\nmonitored directly by the PO. Preference will be given to poor households whose houses were\ndestroyed  in  the  recent  floods.  Loans  by  POs  to  the  final  borrowers  will  be  provided  on\ngenerous terms (at no more than 3-5 percent) and for substantially longer periods than normal,\nreflecting the disaster nature of the facility. PKSF will provide loans to the POs at 1.5 percent,\nrepayable in liberal installments.\n50. In  view  of  the  high  cost  of  both  supervised  microcredit  and  social  intermediation\nactivities, the Government has agreed that part of the concessionality of the ADB loan will be\nused to provide an adequate interest spread to cover all costs and provision for bad and\ndoubtful debts. The Government will relend on an interest-free basis, $10.0 million equivalent\nfrom loan proceeds to PKSF for the SRF. The Government loan to PKSF will be amortized over\n32 years, with a grace period of 8 years, to coincide with the amortization period of the ADB\nloan, and to allow (i) the fund to be replenished, (ii) a revolving fund to be established with\nrepayments, and (iii) the fund to be applied to any future disasters.\n                                                \n10 Loan 1524-BAN(SF): Participatory Livestock Development Project, for $19.7 million, approved on 19 June 1997.", "14\n51.  PKSF submitted a detailed program design for the SRF to ADB, including specific\nlending guidelines, and will designate, within one month after the ADB loan becomes effective, a\nfull-time project coordinator with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB to oversee the\nimplementation of SRF activities.  PKSF will also provide an adequate number of suitable\nqualified professional and support staff to assist the project coordinator to implement the SRF\ncomponent and monitor its subloans to the POs.\n6. Part F:Agriculture\n52. Five seed multiplication farms in the six districts were damaged by the floodwaters. The\nflood affected not only the landowners, but also many of the functionally landless dependent on\nagricultural employment during the harvesting season. The component, described in Appendix\n7, will rehabilitate the seed multiplication farms to supply seeds to the affected farms for the\ncoming cropping season.\nC. Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval\n53. As  rehabilitation  works  will  require  more  detailed  assessments  than  are  currently\navailable, a sector approach will be followed with the identification of subprojects finalized\nduring  project  implementation.  The  subprojects  will  be  identified  and  selected  by  the  EA\nconcerned in accordance with the following general criteria:\n(i)  Subprojects must repair or rehabilitate to appropriate operating and serviceability\nstandards, damage caused by the 2000 floods based on assessments carried\nout by consultants selected for that purpose or in the case of Parts C and F, by\nthe EA, and subject to technical review by ADB as agreed by ADB and the EA\nconcerned. For activities financed under Part E, identification and approval of\nactivities  under  SRF  will  follow  PKSF  rules  and  procedures  for  microcredit\noperations as set out in the subsidiary agreement between the Government and\nPKSF.\n(ii)  Subprojects must not include items that represent deferred maintenance.\n(iii)  Subprojects must be the least-cost solution.\n(iv)  Implementation of subprojects must be completed within the project period of 30\nmonths.\n(v)  Priority will be given to subprojects that rehabilitate ongoing or completed ADB-\nfinanced projects.\n(vi)  No other external financing agency is funding any subprojects.\n(vii)  Subprojects  comply  with  sector-specific  criteria,  including  environmental  and\ninvoluntary resettlement requirements.\n54. The first subproject to be carried out by each EA (except for Part E) will be subject to\nprior review and approval by ADB before commencement. Subsequent subprojects (except for\nPart E) costing over $200,000 will also be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval. For\nsubprojects  that  require  construction  of  infrastructure  along  new  alignments  or  involve", "15\nacquisition of land, the EA will prepare an initial environmental examination (IEE) in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s environmental requirements, and submit the IEE to ADB on a no-objection basis\nprior to construction. For projects that may involve resettlement, the EA will prepare a brief\nresettlement plan for concurrence by ADB prior to commencement of civil works.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n55.

Financing Plan\n56. The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  $54.8  million  equivalent  from  the  Special  Funds\nresources. With application of $13.0 million in loan savings from ongoing ADB projects, ADB\nfunding represents 80 percent of the total project cost. Together with loan savings, the proposed\nADB financing will cover all of the foreign exchange costs of equipment and materials, and 69\npercent of local currency costs, excluding taxes and duties. The Government will provide $17.1\nmillion equivalent from its own resources.", "16\nTable 4: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total Percentage\nADB 29.9 37.9 67.8 80\nGovernment 0.0 17.1 17.1 20\n     Total 29.9 55.0 84.9        100\nADB  =  Asian Development Bank.\n57. The  Borrower  will  be  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh.  If  approved  as\nrecommended by the Mission, the loan will be made available on ADB\u2019s standard terms and\nconditions for Special Funds resources, with a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent\nthereafter. Part of the loan proceeds will be relent by the Borrower to PKSF and provided on an\ninterest-free basis under a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to\nADB, with a repayment period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. For all other EAs,\nthe loan proceeds will be made available through budgetary allocations.\n58. Local cost financing is justified given the existing fiscal situation in Bangladesh and the\nincreased emergency expenditure required for relief and rehabilitation works. ADB financing of\ntotal project costs is proposed to be 80 percent, which exceeds the current cost-sharing limit of\n70 percent for Bangladesh as a B1 country.11 The need for the high proportion of ADB financing\nis justified not only because of the country's weak fiscal position, but also owing to the country's\nneed for increased expenditure to finance rehabilitation works under exceptional circumstances;\nthe arrangement thereby avoid additional demands on the Government budget.\nF. Executing Agencies\n1. Part A:  National, Regional, and Type-A Feeder Roads\n59. RHD within the Roads and Railways Division of the Ministry of Communication will be\nthe EA for Part A of the Project. RHD is responsible for administering the national, regional, and\ntype-A feeder road network. A Chief Engineer heads the organization, with 12 Additional Chief\nEngineers, each responsible for field work in each road zone. RHD has been implementing\nroadworks for about 30 years, including ADB-financed projects since 1973.\n2. Part B: Rural Infrastructure\n60. LGED of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives will\nbe the EA for Part B1 of the Project. LGED, which is responsible for type-B feeder roads, rural\nroads,  and  growth  center  markets,  has  substantial  experience  in  implementing  rural\ninfrastructure  works,  including  several  ADB-assisted  projects.  It  is  currently  implementing\nseveral  externally  assisted  projects.  The  chief  executive  of  LGED  is  the  Chief  Engineer,\nassisted by Additional Chief Engineers.\n                                                \n11 Asian Development Bank. 14 December 1998.

Department of Public Health Engineering, which is responsible for public health facilities,\nincluding water supply and sanitation in community and urban areas, will be the EA for Part B2\nof the Project. The Department has successfully implemented several public health components\nof ADB-assisted projects. It is headed by a Chief Engineer, who is assisted by Additional and\nAssistant Engineers.\n3. Part C: Railways\n62. Bangladesh Railway (BR) under the Roads and Railways Division of the Ministry of\nCommunication will be the EA for Part C of the Project. It is responsible for operation of all rail\npassenger and freight services in Bangladesh and is headed by a Director General, assisted by\nJoint  Director  Generals  and  zonal  general  managers.  BR  has  substantial  experience\nimplementing major ADB-financed projects over several years.\n4. Part D: Water Management and Drainage Facilities\n63. BWDB within the Ministry of Water Resources will be the EA for Part D of the Project.\nBWDB is a semiautonomous body, responsible for providing surface water irrigation, drainage,\nflood control, erosion control, town protection, and river training works throughout Bangladesh.\nBWDB has been the EA for a number of large-scale water resources development projects\nassisted by ADB. BWDB\u2019s performance in these projects has been generally satisfactory.\n  5. Part E:  Socioeconomic Rehabilitation Fund\n64. PKSF will be the EA for Part E of the Project. PKSF was set up by the Government in\n1990 under the Companies Act of Bangladesh as an operationally autonomous nonprofit apex\norganization to provide loans to NGOs, which in turn would provide collateral-free credit to their\npoor members. PKSF also provides advisory services and training to NGOs to enhance their\ninstitutional  capacity.  PKSF  has  received  grants  of  Tk1,100.0  and  $4.8  million  from  the\nGovernment, and Tk650.0 million from United States Agency for International Development\n(USAID). It received loans of $100.0 million from the World Bank under the Poverty Alleviation\nMicrocredit Project, $18.0 million from ADB under the Participatory Livestock Development\nProject, and Tk17.5 million from the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs. PKSF is fully\nfamiliar with the requirements of externally financed projects.\n6. Part F:  Agriculture\n65. The EA for Part F will be the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).  MOA has implemented\npostflood agricultural rehabilitation projects supported by the Government and development\npartners,  and  components  under  ADB-financed  projects.  The  Bangladesh  Agricultural\nDevelopment  Corporation  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  for  the  component.  The\nperformance of the EA and IA in development projects financed by ADB and other external\nfinancing agencies has been satisfactory.", "18\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Coordination\n66. The 1998 Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project (footnote 3) established a PSC chaired\nby  the  Member  (Physical  Infrastructure),  Planning  Commission.  The  PSC  included\nrepresentatives  from  Economic  Relations  Department,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Implementation\nMonitoring and Evaluation Division, and ministries and agencies concerned. Although damages\nfrom the 2000 flood are limited to the southwest part of the country, the inclusion of a PSC\nwithin the Planning Commission is considered essential. This will ensure that implementation is\ncarried out as successfully as in the earlier project, particularly as the damages were severe in\nan area that customarily did not experience floods, and because the proposed Project has\nunique dimensions with the SRF. Meetings to review project implementation with all EAs will be\nconducted as often as required, but at least once every three months for the duration of the\nProject.\n67. Each EA will be responsible in its respective sector for  (i) selecting all subprojects and\napproving  subprojects  up  to  $200,000;  (ii)  designing  civil  works;  (iii)  preparing  tender\ndocuments, and selecting and engaging civil works contractors; (iv) supervising contracts and\nquality control; (v) maintaining accounts, including imprest accounts; (vi) preparing withdrawal\napplications; (vii) engaging consultants; and (viii) submitting progress reports to the PSC and\nADB.\n68. As  the  Project  is  a  relatively  short-term  rehabilitation  activity,  no  new  or  elaborate\ninstitutional structures will be set up. As most works are to be undertaken in or adjacent to areas\ncovered by ongoing ADB-assisted projects, separate project implementation units will not be\nneeded within most of the EAs. Where appropriate, an existing project implementation unit\nunder an ongoing ADB-assisted project will undertake implementation of its part of the Project,\nwith necessary additional capacity in staff, resources, and logistical support.\n2. Simplification of Government Procedures\n69. The Government has issued a Circular (No. PD/NEC-ECNEC/Coordination-2/13/98/223,\n16 October 2000) specifying simplified approval procedures for the rehabilitation of losses and\ndamages owing to flooding in the southwest region of Bangladesh. This, together with other\nsimplified  procedures  of  the  Government\u2019s  customary  processes  for  project  approval  and\nmodification, and procurement of goods and services are described in the assurances (para.\n89).\n3. Procurement\n70. Procurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment and materials will be procured\nunder international competitive bidding for items valued at more than $1,000,000 equivalent or\nby international shopping when the value is $1,000,000 equivalent or less.  Since the project\nsites are scattered, and involve relatively small civil works contracts, the civil works are unlikely\nto attract the interest of international contractors.  Domestic contractors have the capacity and\ncapability to undertake such contracts. Therefore, the Government\u2019s local competitive bidding\nprocedures,  which  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  followed  for  civil  works  contracts.  To\nencourage  the  participation  of  local  residents  (especially  women)  and  provide  them  with\nemployment opportunities, civil works for small earthworks, estimated to cost $2,500 equivalent", "19\nor less in each case, may be awarded to labor-contracting societies in accordance with the\nrespective EA\u2019s standard procurement procedures, including force account, acceptable to ADB\n71. Considering the need for rapid implementation of the Project, and the request of the\nGovernment, a two-envelope tendering procedure will be used for civil works, with a bidding\nperiod of 21 days. The tender evaluation and contract documents for civil works for the first\nsubproject selected by each EA and for civil works with a value exceeding $200,000 equivalent\nwill be reviewed and approved by ADB before the award of the contract.  The award of\nsubsequent civil works contracts with a value not exceeding $200,000 equivalent will be subject\nto ADB\u2019s retroactive approval, provided that, if the award or terms of any such contract are not\nsubsequently approved by ADB, the Government will refund to ADB any payment made from\nthe loan to finance such a contract and then provide the financing from its own or other\nresources.  Equipment  or  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  each  may  be\nprocured on a direct purchase basis. At this stage the details of subprojects are not known and\ntherefore bid packages cannot be itemized. Given the small size and scattered nature of the\nworks, most items will likely be procured locally; Part C may require import of materials such as\nballast. Bid packages will be prepared for the subprojects in line with the practice being followed\nby EAs for ongoing ADB-assisted projects.\n4. Consulting Services\n72. The need for consulting services were considered in view of (i) the need for careful\nverification of flood damage assessment reports in each sector, (ii) the sector loan approach\nrequiring preparation and evaluation of subprojects, (iii) need for intensive supervision for the\nrapid completion of works, (iv) the increased work load on the existing supervisory staff of the\nEAs; and (v) need for consistency in design and construction standards. The only components\nfor which such services will be required are the roads and structures under the supervision of\nRHD (Part A) and LGED (Part B1), and water management under BWBD (Part D) For other\ncomponents, the existing resources were noted to be adequate for the tasks envisaged. The\nProject  will  require  a  total  of  105  person-months  of  international  (major  roads,  75;  rural\ninfrastructure, 30) and 560 person-months of domestic consulting services (major roads, 487;\nrural infrastructure, 57; water management, 16).\n73. The consultants will help the EAs (i) identify and formulate subprojects; (ii) prepare\nspecifications, design, and cost estimates; (iii) evaluate bids and award contracts, (iv) supervise\nconstruction, and quality and cost control, including issue of certificates for payment; and (v)\nreport on progress.\n74. All  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  the  EA  concerned  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. To save time, and in view of the fact that the EAs have\nalready engaged consultants under related ADB-assisted projects, it has been agreed with the\nGovernment that direct engagement of consultants will be undertaken, as provided under these\nguidelines. General conditions for direct selection under the Project require that the consultant\n(i) be currently engaged or have prior experience in a similar ADB-financed flood damage\nrehabilitation project in the country, (ii) have needed expertise available at short notice, and (iii)\nhave been originally selected for ongoing projects following ADB's Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. When required, and at the request of the Government for ADB participation in the\nselection  process,  ADB  may  assist  the  Government  by  undertaking  the  shortlisting  of  the\nconsultants, the invitation of proposals, and the evaluation and ranking of such proposals.", "20\nSpecific selection criteria for sectors requiring consulting services are set out in Appendixes 2, 3\nand 4.\n5. Advance Action\n75. Given the urgency of the Project and the need to initiate flood damage rehabilitation\nactivities so that key works are completed before the onset of the next flood season, ADB has\napproved advance action for the procurement of essential equipment, materials, and civil works,\nand for the recruitment of consultants. The Government was advised that approval of such\nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.\n6. Retroactive Financing\n76. The Project provides for retroactive financing to fully utilize the current working season\nfrom November 2000 to June 2001, and for rehabilitation of critical facilities before the next rainy\nseason. ADB has agreed to provide retroactive financing of eligible expenditures incurred not\nearlier than 15 November 2000 (date of appraisal), provided that the expenditures are certified\nby the EAs and consultants, and that such certification is acceptable to ADB. Retroactive\nfinancing will be approved under the following conditions: (i) the consultants are in the field and\nhave prepared the subproject, (ii) contracts over $50,000 equivalent were approved by ADB,\nand  (iii)  works  were  tendered  according  to  agreed  upon  procedures  and  certified  by  the\nconsultants. Retroactive financing for consulting services has been requested and approved for\nany expenditures incurred not earlier than 15 November 2000. Such retroactive financing should\nnot  exceed  10  percent  of  the  loan  amount  allocated  to  each  project  component.  The\nGovernment has been advised that provision for retroactive financing does not commit ADB to\nfinance any part of the Project.\n7. Implementation Schedule\n77. As the Project is for emergency assistance, project implementation will be completed in\n30 months; this will allow the utilization of as much of the current dry season as possible\n(depending on the rate of water recession from the affected areas, which may take several\nmonths in the most heavily flooded areas) and two dry seasons during 2001/02 and 2002/03.\nThe agreed upon implementation schedule recognizes the critical importance of restoring as\nmuch key infrastructure as possible before the onset of the next rainy season in July 2001. The\nimplementation schedules for the Project are in Appendix 9.\n8. Disbursements\n78. To  expedite  project  implementation,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  in\nBangladesh Bank or in a commercial bank for Parts B \u2013 D and F of the Project, in an initial\namount  not  exceeding  six  months\u2019  estimated  expenditures.  Each  imprest  account  will  be\noperated by the EA concerned in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and\ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and the ADB. The ADB\u2019s statement of\nexpenditures  procedures  will  be  followed  for  reimbursement  of  expenditures  and  for  the\nliquidation of each imprest account for payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent in each\ncase.\n79. For Part A, reimbursement procedures will be followed consistent with current ADB\npractices for ADB-financed RHD-administered projects. For Part E, the Government will relend", "21\nto PKSF through a special account established for that purpose at Bangladesh Bank or in a\ncommercial bank.\n9. Reporting Requirements\n80. The overall progress of project implementation will be monitored by the PSC. The EAs\nwill provide quarterly reports to the PSC and ADB indicating the progress made and problems\nencountered during the review period, the steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the\nproposed program of activities, and the expected progress during the following quarter. In\naddition to such periodic reviews, ADB, the Government, and the EAs will jointly carry out a\ncomprehensive review at the end of the first year of project implementation to address any\nproblems and recommend remedial measures, if any.\n81. Within three months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will submit to\nADB a completion report that provides details about implementation, cost, benefits, and other\ninformation requested by ADB.\n10. Records, Accounts, and Audit\n82. Each EA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and\nservices financed from the loan proceeds, the financing resources received, the expenditures\nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with\nsound accounting principles. Consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will\nbe audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and\nrelated financial statements will be submitted to the ADB not later than 12 months after the end\nof the fiscal year to which they relate\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n83. The Project has been classified as environmental category B: and is not likely to have\nany  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Civil  works  will  involve  rehabilitation  or\nreconstruction of flood-damaged infrastructure. Reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads and\nrailways will follow existing alignments and will avoid acquisition of land or resettlement. All\nsubprojects will follow environmental safeguards and technical design specifications established\nfor  ongoing  ADB  projects,  which  have  already  been  subjected  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental\nassessment  procedures.  During  the  flood,  the  cross  drains  of  the  highways  were  found\ninadequate and in a number of sections that used to be natural channels for runoff, residents cut\nthe highway to allow free passage of floodwaters. Both RHD and LGED have realized the need\nto increase the number of cross drains and may retain the breached sections as permanent\nchannels for surface runoff. In instances were the highway served as a bund preventing the\ninland flow of saline water, the channels can be provided with sluice gates to control the\ndirection of water flow. Although any application of the proposed Project for construction outside\nof the existing right of way of the damaged infrastructure is not foreseen, in instances that the\nflood may have destroyed the integrity of the existing alignment and repair along existing\nalignment may pose risk to public safety, a new alignment may have to be considered. In that\nsituation, the EA concerned will prepare an IEE for submission to ADB for approval on a no-\nobjection  basis  prior  to  starting  construction.  The  Project  will  have  positive  environmental\nbenefits by limiting land erosion and failure of embankments along damaged infrastructure and", "22\nby reducing health risks by rehabilitating damaged water supply and sanitation facilities and\ncleaning drainage systems.\n2. Social Dimensions\n84. A participatory rapid appraisal was conducted to assess the socioeconomic impacts of\nfloods. A social and poverty assessment is in Appendix 10. As a first step to designing the SRF,\nneed assessments were conducted in six affected districts to gather information about the need\nand demand of flood victims. The assessments identified the magnitude of socioeconomic\nimpacts people face; community efforts to address flood victim needs; presence and role of\nGovernment, NGOs, and community-based organizations; the constraints the community faces\nas a result of the disaster; and measures to mitigate those impacts and address the needs of\naffected persons.\n85. Approximately 500,000 houses were affected by floods. About 2 million-3 million people\nin the flooded areas were exposed to the elements. About 80-90 percent of mud houses in the\nareas  did  not  survive  the  floods  and  will  need  to  be  reconstructed.  Damage  to  crops,\ninfrastructure and homestead gardens was substantial.  The standing aman rice (harvest due in\nNovember) and summer vegetable and fruit crops were seriously affected by floods. A large\nnumber of tubewells were inundated and will need to be rehabilitated. Persistent waterlogging\nproblems exist in many areas creating inhuman living conditions and spreading diseases. The\nclean water supply situation is insufficient and latrines are scarce. A major concern is the\nsituation after the recession of floodwaters when the risk of epidemics, particularly diarrheal\ndiseases and skin diseases will be high.  Thus, social issues, such as provision of a safety net\nfor affected people, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups, have emerged as major issues.\nBased  on  community  consultations,  the  major  demands  are:  (i)  drainage  rehabilitation;  (ii)\nhousing; (iii) working capital for on- and off-farm income-generating activities; (iv) employment;\nand (v) rehabilitation of rural and urban basic infrastructure facilities such as roads, schools,\ntubewells, community health centers, and irrigation facilities.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Benefits\n86. The  benefits  of  the  emergency  loan  will  be  evident  in  the  speedy  rehabilitation  of\ninfrastructure  and  facilities  in  the  affected  areas.  By  rehabilitating  public  and  community\ninfrastructure, the Project will help restore social and economic activities disrupted by the flood.\nThe Project will reduce flooding and waterlogging of agricultural land, benefiting residents and\nfarmers in low-lying flood-prone areas.  Improved community water and sanitation facilities will\nhelp reduce risk of health-related problems and improve quality of life. Aside from relieving\nhuman and societal distress, the Project will have economic benefits, which are likely to be\nsubstantial although not fully quantifiable. The civil works under the rural road rehabilitation\ncomponent alone are expected to provide about 262,500 person-days employment to local\nskilled and unskilled labor. The Project will help bring the farmlands in six districts back to\nproductivity, and allow people to regain employment and to generate incomes of their own\ninstead  of  relying  on  Government  emergency  assistance.  Flood  disasters  affect  the  poor\ndisproportionately  in  terms  of  health,  housing,  employment,  livelihood,  and  food  security.\nRehabilitation of vital infrastructure will allow resumption of communication links and economic\nactivity disrupted by flood damage. The Project will involve the repair and rehabilitation of\nexisting roads and bridges; irrigation canals; and urban and community infrastructure, such as", "23\nwater supply, drainage, sewage collection and disposal, and health and education facilities that\nwere damaged by the floods.\nB. Risks\n87. The risk of procedural delays in obtaining various Government approvals that may slow\nimplementation has been offset by the Government\u2019s agreement to use simplified procedures.\nThe selection of EAs with considerable experience in implementing ADB-assisted projects and\nwith familiarity with ADB procedures, implementation by established project implementation\nunits, and use of existing or directly selected consultants minimizes the likelihood of delay at the\nEA level. The availability of counterpart funding has not been a problem to date for ADB projects\nin Bangladesh. The risk of selecting unnecessary subprojects and of governance-related issues\nis addressed by the detailed selection criteria, strong consultant support, and the provisions of\nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  which  have  been  specifically  brought  to  the  attention  of  the\nGovernment and all EAs.\nC. Impact on Poverty\n88. The project area is characterized by high levels of poverty. The national statistics in\nTable 5 tend to hide the incidence of poverty across upazilas and the impact of the 2000 floods\nin an area previously thought to have a moderate level of food security, such as in Satkhira.\nCurrently, in the affected areas, poverty is as high as 80-90 percent with the loss of physical\nassets and income-generating opportunities caused by the flood. The prevalence of poverty\namong  landless  households  and  households  headed  by  women  is  particularly  high.  The\nestimated numbers within vulnerable groups (such as children under 5 years age, pregnant\nmothers, and elderly people) among the total population is approximately 22 percent. A rapid\npoverty assessment was conducted in the project area.  Most of the people living in the project\narea are directly or indirectly involved in agricultural production. About 27 percent are literate.\nThe proportion of literacy among males (67 percent) is more than double the literacy among\nfemales (33 percent).  In the project area, female labor is engaged in the traditional household\nwork, agriculture, fishing, petty trade, and some low-level nonfarm jobs. The lower the status of\nthe family (landless and marginal), the higher the percentage of women involved in activities\nother than household work. The poverty reduction needs addressed through the Project will\ninvolve  urgent  drainage  works  to  allow  faster  recession  of  water  and  enable  agricultural\nactivities  to  resume  microcredit  for  village  reconstruction  and  livelihood  restoration,  and\nrehabilitation of infrastructure to restore access.\n                                            Table 5:  Poverty Profile a\nArea Incidence of Poverty (Moderate and Extreme)\n(percent)\nChuadanga 45-50\nJessore 40-45\nJhenaidah 40-45\nKushtia 50+\nMeherpur 40-45\nSatkhira 35-40\na/  Preflood situation. Owing to massive income erosion and complete loss of physical assets, the\nincidence of poverty has become much higher in the postflood situation, reaching almost 80 percent\nin parts of Satkhira.\nSource: Bangladesh Human Development Report, 1999.

The Government, BWDB, and PKSF have given the following assurances, in addition to\nthe standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n(i)  Each EA will identify and select subprojects based on the general and sector\nspecific criteria agreed to by the Government and ADB.\n(ii)  The Government will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with PKSF for the\nutilization of loan proceeds for the SRF.\n(iii)  The Government will ensure that all facilities restored under the Project are\noperated and maintained by the EA concerned after completion of the works. The\nGovernment will make available, on a timely basis, the necessary funds for\noperation and maintenance during and after project implementation.\n(iv)  The  EAs  will  actively  seek  community  involvement  and  participation  in  the\nselection, design, and implementation of all rehabilitation works carried out under\nthe Project.\n(v)  The Government will allocate on a timely basis adequate counterpart funds from\nits  budget  for  each  fiscal  year  during  project  implementation  starting  from\nFY2000.\n(vi)  Rehabilitation or reconstruction of infrastructure and facilities under the Project,\nthe EAs will carry out the Project according to the Government\u2019s environmental\nstandards and regulations. Each EA will prepare an IEE in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  environmental  requirements  for  any  subproject  that  involves  the\nconstruction of infrastructure along new alignments or acquisition of land, and will\nsubmit the IEE to ADB for approval on a no-objection basis prior to the start of\nconstruction.  Any  acquisition  of  land  or  displacement  of  persons  under  the\nProject will require submission, to ADB for approval, of a brief resettlement plan\nwith compensation and rehabilitation measures consistent with ADB\u2019s policy on\ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  the  laws,  practices,  and  procedures  of  the\nGovernment.\n(vii)  The  simplified  procedures  specified  in  Government  Circular  No.  PD/NEC-\nECNEC/  Coordination-2/13/98/223  dated  16  October  2000  will  apply  to  the\nProject.\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the Planning Commission approves subprojects\nnot already included in the Annual Development Plan for FY2000 under the\nsimplified approval procedures specified in the circular (para. 89[vii]). In giving\nsuch  approval,  the  Planning  Commission  will  (i)  provide  the  necessary\ncounterpart funding, and (ii) issue a specific order to the EAs that the subprojects\nare included in the Annual Development Plan for FY2000, and authorize the\nopening of any imprest accounts required for the Project.", "25\n(ix)  As in the 1998 flood rehabilitation project, the Government will delegate authority\nto the concerned line ministries to increase consulting service inputs by contract\nvariation of up to 33 percent of the existing contract to meet the estimated cost of\nservices needed for project rehabilitation works.\n(x)  The Government will increase, for the purpose of the Project, the delegated\nfinancial  authority  of  the  Chief  Engineer  and  the  Additional  Chief\nEngineer/Project  Director  of  RHD  to  approve  contracts  under  the  Project  in\namounts necessary to facilitate and expedite successful implementation of the\nProject.\nB. Condition for Disbursement\n90. The conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and PKSF,\nsatisfactory to ADB, will be in place before withdrawals can be made for Part E of the Project to\nbe carried out by that agency.\nVIII. USE OF SURPLUS LOAN FUNDS\n91. The cost of rehabilitating of damage caused by the floods in southwest Bangladesh was\nestimated at over $200.0 million. While prepared to respond to the crisis, ADB is cognizant of\nthe  constraints  on  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources.  ADB\u2019s  policy12  on  disaster\nrehabilitation allows the use of surplus loan funds for rehabilitation works. A detailed review was\nundertaken of the availability of surplus loan funds that could be used to meet some of the\nfinancing requirements of the proposed Project. The Mission identified $13.0 million in surplus\nloan funds from four ongoing projects, primarily from currency depreciation and lower than\nestimated appraisal costs.\n92. The  Government  has  requested  that  the  identified  surplus  loan  funds  be  used  for\nrehabilitation works to be carried out under three of the components identified for the Project\n(Parts B, C and E), which are in sectors different from those in the ongoing projects. The\nimplementation arrangements described in paras. 30 and 31 will also apply to the use of loan\nsavings. The utilization of surplus funds across sectors is shown in Table 6.\n                                                \n12 ADB. 1995.

Under the current financial framework for the management of ADF resources approved\nby  the  Board  of  D  rectors,13  resources  identified  from  loan  savings  and  cancellation  are\ncustomarily required to be allocated to the resource pool supporting the expended advance\ncommitment authority. Owing to the emergency nature and unprecedented severity of the 2000\nfloods, and constraints on ADF resources, it is proposed to re-employ $13.0 million in loan\nsavings identified for flood damage rehabilitation in four ADF-financed projects for the purposes\nidentified in para. 92. As the utilization of such loan savings is an integral part of the Project,\nBoard approval is being sought in this report. The four ongoing loans are proposed to be\nrestructured such that (i) the savings under three of the ongoing loans will be canceled from the\nrespective loan accounts and added to the loan account of one ongoing loan, and (ii) the project\nscope of that ongoing loan will be expanded to undertake the rehabilitation assistance. As no\nnew ADF resources will be used in the proposed restructuring, it is appropriate that the terms\nand conditions of the expanded loan would remain unchanged. Subject to the approval of the\nrecommendation in para. 94, the loan documents for those projects will be appropriately revised\nto reflect the necessary changes.\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION\n94. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve:\n(i)   the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 42,747,000 (forty\ntwo  million  seven  hundred  forty  seven  thousand)  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of\nBangladesh for the Southwest Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project, with a term of\n                                                \n13  R105-98: Treatment of Loan Savings and Cancellation, 9 July 1998.", "27\n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate\nof  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance\nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board;\n(ii)   the proposed change in scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation of\nloan  proceeds  under  the  Forestry  Sector  Project  [Loan  1486-BAN(SF)]  to  allow\nrehabilitation of damage caused by floods in southwest Bangladesh; and\n(iii)   the proposed reemployment on the terms and conditions applicable to Loan 1486-\nBAN(SF) of loan proceeds canceled under the three following loans to finance the\neligible  costs  of  rehabilitation  of  damage  caused  by  the  floods  in  southwest\nBangladesh under the expanded scope proposed in (ii):\n(a) Loan 1298-BAN(SF):Jamuna Bridge Project;\n(b) Loan 1268-BAN(SF): Secondary Education Development Project; and\n(c) Loan 1353-BAN(SF): Coastal Greenbelt Project.\nTADAO CHINO\n      President\n4 December 2000.", "28\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page         Cited on\n     (page, para.)\n1  Summary of Proposed ADB Assistance  29 1, 3\n2  National, Regional, and Type-A Feeder Roads 30 11, 38\n3  Rural Infrastructure 36 11, 40\n4  Railways 41 12, 43\n5  Water Management and Drainage Facilities 44 12, 44\n6  Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation 51 13, 48\n7  Agriculture 55 14, 52\n8  Detailed Cost Estimates 56 15, 55\n9  Implementation Schedules 57 20, 77\n10  Social and Poverty Assessment 59 22, 84", "29\nAppendix 1\nSUMMARY OF PROPOSED ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE\n($ million)\nUse of Loan Total\nAreas of Cost of Surplus Funds ADB Government Agency\nSector Rehabilitation Rehabilitation Loan under Assistance Contribution Concerned\nAssistance Funds Project\nPart A: Roads National and 40.20 0.00 31.78 31.78 8.42 RHD\nregional roads,\ntype-A feeder\nroads, bridges,\nculverts\nPart B: Rural Part B1: type-B 12.25 1.00 8.80 9.80 2.45 LGED\nInfrastructure feeder roads,\ntype-1 rural\nroads, bridges,\nculverts,\ngrowth center\nmarkets\nPart B2: Water 2.15 1.22 0.50 1.72 0.43 DPHE\nsupply and\nsanitation\nPart C: Tracks, 2.00 0.00 1.60 1.60 0.40 BR\nRailways bridges,\nfacilities\nPart D: Water Embankments, 16.50 3.28 9.92 13.20 3.30 BWDB\nManagement water control\nand Drainage structures,\nFacilities canals\nPart E: Community 10.00 7.50 0.50 8.00 2.00 PKSF\nSocioeconomic facilities,\nRehabilitation village\nFund reconstruction,\nemployment\ncreation\nPart F: Seed 0.60 0.00 0.50 0.50 0.10 MOA/BADC\nAgriculture multiplication\nfarms\nInterest Charge 1.20 0.00 1.20 1.20 0.00\nTotal 84.90 13.00 54.80 67.80 17.10\nPercentage            100        15         65              80              20\nNote: Government contribution includes contribution to works funded by loan savings as well as the proposed Project.\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BADC = Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation, BR = Bangladesh\nRailway, BWDB = Bangladesh Water Development Board, LGED = Local Government Engineering Department,\nMOA = Ministry of Agriculture, DPHE = Department of Public Health Engineering, PKSF = Palli Karma Sahayak\nFoundation, RHD = Roads and Highways Department.", "Appendix 2, page 1\n30\nNATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND TYPE-A FEEDER ROADS\nA. Damage and Impact\n1. The floods that started on 17 September 2000 inundated about 60 percent of the land\narea in southwest Bangladesh, principally in seven districts. Damage to the road network was\nextensive. Initially, various road links were under water and the pavement structures became\nweaker as the duration of inundation increased. During this time, the roads were still traversed\nby trucks and buses. The movement of vehicles contributed significantly to the destruction of\npavement  surfaces,  but  the  need  to  move  people  and  supplies  around  the  country  was\nnecessary. The next phase of road damage occurred when the floodwaters started to recede\nand as the water rushed to find convenient outlets, embankments were scoured, abutments\nwashed  away,  and  many  bridges  and  culverts  were  damaged  or  disappeared.  With  road\ntransport to the southwest districts of the country completely cut off, relief efforts were met by\nother transport means or through longer land routes. In areas most affected by the floods, the\nsocial and economic cost was high, and complete recovery will require repair or rehabilitation of\nthe infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and culverts, damaged by the floods.\n2. About 600 kilometers (km) of roads were submerged, and damage was sustained to\n1,213 km of embankment, and 800 bridges and culverts. The total estimated cost of the damage\nat that time was Tk2,302 million ($42.5 million). Consultants will be engaged to refine these\nestimates using a detailed assessment and to supervise construction.\nB. Scope\n3. Under Part A of the Project, flood-damaged national, regional, and feeder type-A roads\nwill be rehabilitated, essentially to their condition before the flood within eight districts of Khulna\nzone under the Roads and Highways Department (RHD).\n4. This component of the Project will cover all repair and reconstruction necessary to\nrestore the basic road transport network to full serviceability conditions prior to the 2000 flood.\nThe project consultants will conduct a detailed damage assessment that will identify priorities\nand  estimate  the  rehabilitation  cost.  Although  the  priorities  will  be  followed  to  prepare\nsubprojects, exceptions can be made in line with the criteria for subprojects shown in para. 5\nand in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Repairs will vary from minor repair\nof an existing facility to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of culverts or bridges. Repair works\nwill be carried out to restore the facility to the preflood level or to a marginally higher standard as\nconsidered cost effective, and where appropriate will include flood protection measures to\nminimize damage from future floods.\nC. Subproject Selection Criteria\n5. Subprojects will meet the following criteria:\n(i) The subproject will comprise repair and rehabilitation, without any increase in the\nheight of the road, of the extensive damage of the RHD road network in the\nKhulna  zone  (seven  districts  for  national  and  regional  roads:  Chuadanga,\nKushtia,  Jessore,  Jhenaidah,  Magura,  Meherpur,  Satkhira;  three  districts  for\ntype-A feeder roads: Jessore, Jhenaidah, Satkhira; and one flood-damaged road", "31\nAppendix 2, page 2\nin Khulna (Tala-Paikgacha). The damage must have been caused by the 2000\nfloods and be identified by the consultant during detailed damage assessment.\n(ii) The subproject does not comprise deferred maintenance.\n(iii) The subproject must be the least cost solution.\n(iv) No other aid agency is providing financing for the roads, bridges, and culverts\nproposed under the subproject.\n(v) To ensure contractor efficiency and ease of implementation, the subproject civil\nworks will be in the same general area.\n(vi) The subproject will comprise similar types of civil works.\n(vii) The  subproject  will  have  packages  generally  ranging  from  Tk10.0  million\n($184,270.0) to Tk80.0 million ($1.47 million).\n(viii) Subproject works will be based on technical and environmental design standards\npresently being followed under ongoing ADB-financed projects.\n(ix) Subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  conformity  with  the  Government\u2019s\nenvironmental standards and regulations.\n(x) Subprojects will avoid resettlement of people or acquisition of land.\nD. Cost Estimates\n6. Based on the preliminary assessment, the cost of restoration and rehabilitation works is\nabout $40.2 million. The consulting services cost of $3.7 million includes remuneration and\nother  expenses,  and  provides  for  office  equipment,  vehicles,  office  supplies,  and  vehicle\noperation. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost, and part of the local currency cost\nfor a total of $31.8 million equivalent or 80 percent of the total project cost. ADB financing will\ncover the entire cost, both foreign exchange and local currency, for consulting services. The\nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency cost of $8.4 million equivalent, which\nincludes taxes and duties.

Implementation Arrangements\n7. RHD within the Roads and Railways Division of the Ministry of Communication will be\nthe Executing Agency for this project component. RHD is responsible for administration of the\nnational, regional, and type-A feeder road network. RHD has a Chief Engineer as the chief\nexecutive, and 12 Additional Chief Engineers (ACEs). Five ACEs assist the chief engineer with\nvarious functions at the headquarters in Dhaka and are in charge of ADB-funded projects, World\nBank projects, network management, technical services, and mechanical services. Seven other\nACEs, one for each of RHD's seven zones, are responsible for construction and maintenance\noperations  and  are  located  in  Barisal,  Chittagong,  Comilla,  Dhaka,  Khulna,  Rajshahi,  and\nRangpur. Each of the ACEs has an adequate number of staff. RHD has been carrying out road\nworks for about 30 years, including projects financed by ADB and the World Bank since 1973.\nRHD has acquired considerable experience and under arrangements agreed upon for project\nimplementation will be able to satisfactorily execute this component.\n8. The Chief Engineer, RHD, will have overall responsibility for implementation with day-to-\nday  implementation  coordinated  by  the  ACE  responsible  for  ADB-funded  projects.  The\nrespective zonal ACEs will act as project directors, the respective Superintending Engineers as\nadditional project directors, and the Executive Engineers as project managers and Subdivisional\nEngineers as deputy project managers. The ACE in charge of ADB-funded projects (ACE-ADB)1\nwill undertake coordination within RHD and the Government, and with other agencies, including\nthe Project Steering Committee (PSC) and ADB. The ACE-ADB will also be responsible for the\nsubmission of progress reports and disbursement requests to ADB. The zonal ACE will make\npayments to the contractors and the project coordinator (ACE-ADB) will process withdrawals\nunder reimbursement procedures in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nF. Consulting Services\n9. Both international and domestic consultants will be needed for the detailed damage\nassessment,  detailed  design,  and  project  implementation.  Considering  the  urgency  of  the\nProject  and  the  need  for  rapid  preparation  and  implementation,  the  Mission  agreed  to\nrecommend advance action for the engagement of consultants to ADB at the request of the\nGovernment. Similarly, the Mission recommended and the Government agreed to the direct\nselection  of  consultants  for  the  component.  Conditions  for  direct  selection  are  that  the\nconsultants (i) be currently engaged in a similar ADB-financed project in the country, (ii) have\nneeded expertise available at short notice, and (iii) were originally selected for ongoing project\nfollowing the ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\n10. Staffing  inputs  will  be  about  75  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  487\nperson-months of domestic consulting. The exact number of person-months will be determined\non the basis of the detailed assessment that will be carried out in the first phase of the\ncontractor\u2019s work, followed by the second phase of full deployment. Expertise required includes\nproject  and  contract  management,  materials  and  hydrological  engineering,  structural\nengineering, and construction operations. The services will be provided over about 30 months.\nThe consultant's contract will include facilities and services required, including accommodation,\nvehicles, offices, and equipment. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are\nincluded in paras. 15-19.\n                                                \n1 Project Director (ACE), RHD, Jamuna Bridge Access Roads Project, also responsible for all ADB projects and for\nease of reference is referred to as the ACE-ADB.", "Appendix 2, page 4\n33\nG. Procurement\n11. The procurement of all goods and services under the Project will be carried out in\naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Given the urgency of the Project, at the\nrequest of the Government, the Mission agreed to ask ADB to approve advance procurement\naction with the understanding that such action does not commit ADB to finance any part of the\nProject. Contract packages, except for some culvert and bridge works, will generally range in\nvalue from Tk10.0 million to Tk80.0 million. Considering the urgent need for speedy project\nimplementation, ADB has agreed to a request by the Government to follow a two-envelope\ntendering procedure and a bidding period of 15 days. Local competitive bidding procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB  will  be  followed.  To  facilitate  award  of  civil  works  contracts,  contract\ndocuments, and tender evaluation for the first subproject will be reviewed and approved by\nADB. Following this, signed contracts will be submitted to ADB for retroactive approval on the\ncondition that should any subproject or contract be found to not conform to the agreed criteria\nand procedures, the Government will be required to finance such contract(s) from its resources.\n12. Considering  the  urgency  of  project  implementation,  the  Government  has  agreed  to\ndelegate additional financial authority to the Chief Engineer, Additional Chief Engineers, and\nProject  Director  in  RHD  to  approve  contracts  under  the  Project  in  amounts  necessary  to\nfacilitate and expedite successful implementation of the Project. The Government will provide all\nfacilities and permits for importation of equipment, construction materials, and spare parts for\nequipment needed in connection with implementation of the Project.\n13. In the interest of economy and efficiency, the subprojects will involve similar types of\nwork  in  the  same  geographic  setting.  Bridge  rehabilitation  contracts  will  involve  repair  or\nreconstruction of large culverts and small bridges. No large bridges require reconstruction.\nConsidering  the  small  size  of  the  contracts  and  their  scattered  locations,  international\ncontractors are not likely to be interested, and the bidding will be carried out following LCB\nprocedures acceptable to ADB.\nH. Implementation Schedule\n14. Project implementation will be spread over about 30 months to take advantage of two\ndry seasons and allow for the recession of waters in the current 2000/01 dry season. Priority\nroad  civil  works  will  be  completed  during  the  current  construction  season  to  June  2001,\nremaining roadworks and bridge/culvert works may require two more construction seasons to\nJune 2003.\nI. Summary Terms of Reference for Consultant Services\n1. Scope of Services\n15. The component will restore to preflood full serviceability levels those sections of the\nnational, regional, and type-A feeder roads in the Khulna zone damaged by the 2000 floods.\nThe rehabilitation works will be undertaken by local contractors through contracts generally\nranging in value from Tk10.0 million to Tk80.0 million.", "Appendix 2, page 5\n34\na. Flood Damage Assessment and Subproject Preparation\n16. The consultant tasks will include, but not be limited to, the following:\n(i)  Review the findings of the preliminary flood damage assessment report prepared\nby RHD.\n(ii)  Conduct a detailed survey to assess damage from the 2000 flood.\n(iii)  Confirm  the  findings  of  the  RHD  damage  assessment  and  provide\nrecommendations.\n(iv)  Prepare subprojects that generally meet the criteria outlined in para. 5.\nb.

The consultants will have the following responsibilities:\n(i)  Prepare tender documents that allow for a two-envelope bidding procedure. This\nprocedure will have the following features. The first envelope will contain the\ntechnical  qualifications  of  the  bidder.  Prior  to  inviting  the  first  tender,  post-\nqualification criteria will be established and agreed upon by the Government and\nthe ADB. A method will be established to ensure that contractors do not exceed\ntheir  capacity  to  undertake  the  work.  The  second  envelope  will  contain  the\nfinancial bid.\n(ii)  Help RHD evaluate the tenders and recommend contract awards to the ACE of\nthe zone.\n(iii)  Administer the civil works contracts as the Engineer\u2019s Representative as defined\nin the contract documents.\nd. Construction Supervision\n19. The consultant will:\n(i)  provide day-to-day supervision of the civil works on-site by providing suitably\nqualified and experienced supervision staff;\n(ii)  certify the work achieved to the ACE for payment to the contractor;", "Appendix 2, page 6\n35\n(iii)  ensure that proposed subprojects are environmentally sound and incorporate\nmitigation  measures  as  appropriate  to  meet  Government  environmental\nstandards and regulations, and that implementation is in compliance with the\nenvironmental  and  social  impact  mitigation  requirements  of  the  civil  works\ncontracts; and\n(iv)  prepare regular progress and other reports.\n2.

Damage and Impact\n1. The  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  Department  of  Public\nHealth  Engineering  (DPHE)  have  carried  out  assessments  of  the  flood  damage  on  rural\ninfrastructure in the southwest region of Bangladesh. The 2000 floods seriously affected six\ndistricts, most of which were covered under the recently completed Second Rural Infrastructure\nDevelopment Projects (SRIDP)1 financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Damage to\nrural roads, including type-B feeder roads and type-1 rural roads, was extensive. In the flooded\nareas, only road embankments were left above water and wave action caused erosion on the\nboth sides of road embankments. The floodwaters breached many of the major roads and\nscoured parts of road embankments where drainage was inadequate. Many bridge approaches\nare being washed away with the recession of floodwaters. In the public health area, damage\nwas sustained to water supply and sanitation facilities throughout the southwest region.\nTable A3.1:  Damage to Rural Infrastructure\nInfrastructure Flood Damage Rehabilitation\nCost\n($ million)\nFeeder Roads Type B under SRIDP >167 km 4.00\nFeeder Roads Type B non-SRIDP 160 km 3.90\nRural Roads Type 1 200 km 3.00\nStructures on Type B and Type 1 600 m 0.50\nGrowth Centers Markets 35 no 0.15\nSanitation and Water Supply 200 ponds, 1600 tubewells, 2.15\n54 latrine production centers\nTotal 13.70\nkm = kilometer, m = meter, SRIDP = Second Rural Infrastructure Development Project.\nSource: Government, Staff estimates.\nB.

Under the supervision of the Additional Chief Engineer (projects), LGED, the project\ndirector  of  the  completed  SRIDP  will  be  made  responsible  for  overall  implementation  and", "39\nAppendix 3, page 4\ncoordination of this subcomponent in accordance with the arrangements for ongoing ADB-\nfinanced projects. The Chief Engineer, LGED will provide overall guidance. In consultation with\nlocal communities, selection of subprojects out of the list will be carried out by Executive\nEngineers of each district under the supervision of the project director.\n2. Part B2: Public Health Facilities\n9. DPHE under MLGRDC will be the Executing Agency for water supply and sanitation\nactivities for this subcomponent. The Chief Engineer, DPHE will provide overall guidance and\nappoint a project director to implement the works, with community consultation and coordination\nwith LGED where facilities are provided at schools and/or market growth centers.\nF. Procurement\n10. Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Procurement.  In view of the small size of contracts that are scattered over the six\ndistricts,  all  the  civil  works  will  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The maximum contract amount should not exceed $200,000\nunless  ADB  approves  it  as  an  exceptional  case;  to  avoid  an  excessive  number  of  small\ncontracts that make administration difficult, the minimum contract size should be Tk1.0 million. A\nroster of prequalified contractors will be prepared at the start of the Project, and updated\nannually, using procedures acceptable to ADB. Small earthwork contracts costing less than\n$2,500  equivalent  may  be  carried  out  by  labor-contracting  societies  organized  by\nnongovernment organizations or LGED/DPHE facilitators, in accordance with force account\nprocedures.\nG. Implementation Schedule\n11. The project implementation period will be 30 months with two construction seasons\nbeyond  the  current  season,  which  may  be  largely  lost  owing  to  the  slow  recession  of\nfloodwaters. Implementation will commence in January 2001, and be completed by June 2003\nfor Part B1, and June 2002 for Part B2. Start-up activities will include:\n(i)  detailed assessment of damage to rural infrastructure;\n(ii)  selection of subprojects according to established criteria;\n(iii)  preparation of detailed designs, cost estimates, and tender documents;\n(iv)  contract awards; and\n(v)  supervision of the most urgent works to be implemented under retroactive\nfinancing arrangements starting on 15 November 2000.\nH. Consulting Services\n12. Due to the emergency nature of the proposed rehabilitation works, consulting services\nwill be required immediately for roads and structures, to conduct detailed assessments of\ndamage to rural infrastructure. LGED will appoint consultants for its works on a direct selection\nbasis for the construction period. Approximately 30 person-months of international consulting\nand  60  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The  Mission", "40\nAppendix 3, page 5\nrecommended and the Government agreed to the direct selection of consultants for the public\nhealth facilities subcomponent. Conditions for direct selection are that the consultants (i) be\ncurrently engaged in a similar ADB-financed project in the country, (ii) have needed expertise\navailable at short notice, and (iii) were originally selected for an ongoing project following ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\n13. The consultants will undertake, but not be limited to, the following principal tasks:\n(i)  assess the damage caused to LGED facilities by the 2000 floods;\n(ii)  help LGED staff prepare detailed design, cost estimates, and tender documents;\n(iii)  advise LGED on the prequalification of contractors;\n(iv)  advise on appropriate contract packages for the works envisaged;\n(v)  assist in site supervision of construction works to ensure that design standards\nand technical specifications are achieved;\n(vi)  ensure that construction schedules are maintained;\n(vii)  measure and check together with LGED staff all works presented for payment\nand approve the quality and quantity of the works;\n(viii)  check and endorse progress bills from contractors;\n(ix)  monitor the overall progress of the component;\n(x)  prepare quarterly progress reports for LGED for submission to project steering\ncommittee and ADB;\n(xi)  prepare a project completion report at the end of the services.\n14. No consulting services will be required for the DPHE component (Part B2).", "Appendix 4, page 1\n41\nRAILWAYS\nA. Background\n1. The sudden onrush of the October 2000 floodwaters caused serious damage to railway\nembankments,  tracks,  bridges,  ferry  landings,  and  buildings.  The  affected  sections  of\nBangladesh  Railway  (BR)  in  the  southwest  were  Jessore-Benapole,  Chuadanga-Darsana,\nDarsana-Darsana border, and Rohanpur-Rohanpur border. The floodwater flow affected the\nferry connecting Trimohini-Balashi Ghat section in West Zone. Typical damage included railway\nembankment erosion, loss of ballast, displacement of track at certain locations, damage to brick\npiers and abutments of bridges, and damage to roads and level crossing gates. Initial damage\nassessed by BR shows that about 128 kilometers (km) of track and seven bridges experienced\nphysical damage. Five new bridges need to be constructed to allow for proper drainage of water\nalong the affected tracks.\nB. Scope\n2. Under  Part  C  of  the  Project,  flood-damaged  infrastructure  and  related  facilities\n(embankment, track, bridges, essential buildings and station roads, level crossings) in the flood\naffected areas will be rehabilitated to full operational levels.\n3. The  initial  damage  survey  conducted  by  BR  identified  priorities  and  estimated  the\nrehabilitation cost for damaged track sections and bridges, types of damages, and estimated\ncost.  The  repairs  will  vary  from  minor  repair  of  an  existing  facility  to  major  repair  and\nrehabilitation of track sections or bridges. The repair works will be carried out to restore the\nfacility to the preflood level or to a marginally higher standard as considered cost effective, and\nwhere appropriate will include flood protection measures to minimize damage from future floods.\nAs far as possible, the works will not include hardwood sleepers. Ballast and sleeper laying\nshould be done by force account.\nC. Subproject Selection Criteria\n4. Apart from the general selection criteria applied to all components, the following specific\ncriteria will be applied to the restoration works subprojects:\n(i)  the damage is located on the railway network affected by the 2000 flood;\n(ii)  the subproject is a part of the detailed damage assessment survey of BR;\n(iii)  a subproject will constitute similar types of works in well-defined locations such\nas track sections and bridge locations;\n(iv)  major changes or modification of subprojects will be submitted to the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for prior approval;\n(v)  all  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  works  will,  as  appropriate,  be  based  on\ntechnical and environmental design standards presently being followed under\nsimilar ADB-financed projects;\n(vi)  all  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  conformity  with  the  Government\u2019s\nenvironmental standards and regulations; and", "Appendix 4, page 2\n42\n(vii)  subprojects will avoid resettlement of affected people.\nD. Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n5. The total cost estimated for the railways rehabilitation program and financing plan is\nprovided in the following table.\nTable A4: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nTracks 1.22 0.35 1.57\nBridges 0.25 0.05 0.30\nFacilities 0.10 0.03 0.13\n      Total 1.57 0.43 2.00\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n6. BR  under  the  Ministry  of  Communication  will  be  Executing  Agency  for  the  railway\ncomponent of the Project. Headed by a Director General, BR is responsible for operation of all\npassenger and freight services in Bangladesh. BR has substantial experience implementing\nADB-financed projects as well as projects of similar type, i.e., rehabilitation of flood damaged\nrailway sections in 1998 is the most recent example.\n7. BR had appointed a project coordinator under the Director General to coordinate and\nmonitor rehabilitation works of the flood damage of 1998. This coordinator will have overall\nresponsibility for coordinating and monitoring of Part C of the proposed Project. Day-to-day\nimplementation will be managed by the Chief Engineer of West Zone as the project director.\nThe  coordinator  will  be  responsible  for  submitting  the  progress  reports  and  disbursement\nrequests to ADB and the Project Steering Committee.\nF. Procurement\n8. The procurement of all goods and services under the Project will be carried out in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, essentially as applied for ADB assistance\nfor damage rehabilitation for the1998 flood. As under that project, given the urgency of the\nsituation,  and  at  the  request  of  the  Government,  BR  will  follow  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. BR will adopt a two-envelope tendering procedure and a bidding\nperiod of 21 days for civil works contracts valued at over $200,000 using its current roster of\nprequalified contractors. For materials to be procured under international competitive bidding, a\nbidding period of 30 days will be allowed. To facilitate the award of local competitive bidding\ncontracts, the first subproject contract documents and tender evaluation will be reviewed and\napproved by ADB. Thereafter, signed contracts will be submitted to ADB for retroactive approval\non the condition that any subproject or contract found to not conform with the established\ncriteria  and  procedures  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  from  its  own  resources.  For\ncontracts exceeding $200,000, contract documents and tender evaluation will be subject to ADB\nreview and approval. The Government will provide all facilities and permits for importation of\nmaterials and equipment needed in connection with the implementation of the component.", "43\nAppendix 4, page 3\n9. Contract packages for the component are expected to range from Tk0.7 million to Tk7.0\nmillion. Considering the small size of the contracts, they are not likely to be of interest to\ninternational contractors and will be carried out using local competitive bidding procedures.\nG. Implementation Schedule\n10. The railway component will be implemented over 18 months. The rehabilitation works,\nincluding procurement of ballast and sleepers, will be completed by 30 June 2002.\nH. Consulting Services\n11. As the damage is not extensive and the works are limited in area and scope, consulting\nservices will not be required to carry out works for this component.", "44\nAppendix 5, page 1\nWATER MANAGEMENT AND DRAINAGE FACILITIES\n \nA. Damage and Impact\n1. Bangladesh experienced an abnormal late monsoon flood in 2000 in the southwest\nregion of the country. Rainfall records show that in the region received unusually high rainfall.\nThese  high  rainfalls  obviously  extended  into  West  Bengal  in  India  and  caused  massive\noverflows in West Bengal, which entered Bangladesh, adding to the severe flood damage from\nthe local high rainfall in eight districts in the region. The flood was very unusual because the\narea had not experienced a flood of such magnitude in past 60 years. Occasionally, the area is\nsubjected to drainage congestion during heavy rainfall particularly with the coastal polder areas.\nThe main cause of flooding was attributed to the tremendous flood inflow from West Bengal.\nExtensive areas of Chuadanga, Jessore, Jhenaidah, Kushtia, Meherpur, and Satkhira districts\nwere inundated. Nearly 2.5 million people were affected. Most of the homesteads in the flood-\naffected  areas  were  damaged.  Vegetable  gardens,  aman  crop,  and  fisheries  were  mostly\ndamaged in the flood-hit areas. Thousands of people were rendered homeless. Immense loss\noccurred to the forestry and plantation in the area. The flood caused huge damage to road\nbridges and culverts, at many locations the road pavement had to be cut open to allow faster\ndrainage of floodwater. Immediate repair and rehabilitation works are necessary to restore flood\ncontrol,  improve  drainage  on  a  short-term  basis,  and  secure  the  functioning  of  drainage\ninfrastructure in the region.\n2. Damage in the water resources sector caused by the flood requires rehabilitation works\nestimated by the Government at about $46 million. An assessment of the total damage of flood\ncontrol and drainage facilities is presented in Table A5.1.\nTable A5.1: Total Damage of Flood Control and Drainage Facilities\nItem Unit Fully Damaged Partially Damaged\nEmbankments km 78 168\nSluices no. 25 208\nBridges and culverts no. 40 164\nProtective works km 3 1\nClosure no. 184 0\nDrainage canals km 2 863\nSource: Bangladesh Water Development Board.\nB. Large- and Medium-Scale Works\n \n1. The Selection Criteria Applied\n3. Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has identified six districts to be included\nunder this project component and prepared estimates of rehabilitation costs (Table A5.2). On\nthe basis of those estimates and field visits, the damaged structure have been appraised and a\nlist of rehabilitation works have been prepared to be included in the Project. The rehabilitation\nworks identified meet the following criteria:", "45\nAppendix 5, page 2\n(i)  The structure was damaged by the 2000 floods.\n(ii)  All works can be completed by June 2002.\n(iii)  No other aid agency will provide financing for rehabilitation.\n(iv)  The facilities are located in densely populated or intensively cultivated areas.\n(v)  The works will protect communities from floods and river erosion.\n(vi)  Protection of embankments will reduce environmental damage.\n(vii)  The works will avoid resettlement of people.\nTable A5.2: Identified Rehabilitation Works\n($ million)\nDistricts Estimated Cost\n1.

Under Part D of the Project, large- and medium-scale projects will cover urgent repair\nand reconstruction of flood control and drainage facilities in the six districts necessary to restore\nthem to their condition prior to the flood, and to upgrade some of them for disaster prevention\n(Table A5.2). These facilities include embankments, flood control and drainage structures, and\ndrainage canals. Restoration works will include filling of embankment breaches, resectioning,\nand protecting of damaged embankments. Damaged or destroyed water control structures and\ncanals will be also repaired or replaced.\n5. BWDB, the Executing Agency, will carry out surveys and detailed engineering design of\nthe damaged facilities. BWDB will ensure that the quality of work is of an appropriately high\nstandard, so rehabilitation works under the Project will be restored to their original specifications\nto ensure integrity with the remaining parts of the facilities.\n3. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n6. The  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $16.5  million,  including  about  $2.4  million  in  foreign\nexchange cost and $14.1 million equivalent in local currency cost. The cost summary is shown\nin Table A5.3.", "46\nAppendix 5, page 3\nTable A5.3: Project Cost Summary\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nCivil works 2.4 13.8 16.2\nConsulting Services 0.0  0.3   0.3\nTotal 2.4        14.1        16.5\n7. Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing will amount to $13.2 million equivalent, or 80\npercent of the total cost, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost of $2.4 million and $10.8\nmillion equivalent in local currency cost (Table A5.4). ADB financing will cover civil works costs\nand consulting services. The Government will provide from its own resources the balance of the\nproject cost, estimated at $3.3 million equivalent.\nTable A5.4: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost Percentage\nADB 2.4     10.8   13.2  80\nGovernment 0.0   3.3    3.3  20\n      Total 2.4  14.1  16.5 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank\n4. Implementation Arrangements\n8. BWDB under the Ministry of Water Resources will be the Project Executing Agency.\nBWDB, established in 1972, is a semiautonomous body, responsible for providing surface water\nirrigation, drainage, flood control, erosion control, town protection, and river training works\nthroughout Bangladesh. BWDB has been the executing agency for a number of large-scale\nwater resource development projects. The performance of BWDB in these projects has been\ngenerally  satisfactory.  BWDB  is  considered  to  be  capable  of  implementing  the  project\ncomponent satisfactorily with the assistance of a team of consultants.\n9. For the reconstruction of component facilities, the Director, Project Management Unit,\nunder the overall guidance of the additional director general (operation and maintenance), will\nbe responsible for coordinating and monitoring project activities. At the field level, responsibility\nfor  implementation  will  rest  with  executive  engineers,  under  the  supervision  of  their\nSuperintending engineer and zonal Chief Engineer. The Executive Engineers will be responsible\nfor  preparing  tender  documents,  selecting  contractors,  awarding  contracts,  supervising\nconstruction,  providing  quality  control,  and  establishing  accounting  and  detailed  financial\ncontrol. Design assistance will be provided by Chief Engineer, Design.\n10. BWDB will prepare an initial environment examination (IEE), in accordance with the\nADB\u2019s environmental requirements, in any case that involves construction of new infrastructure\nand  resettlement  of  affected  people,  and  will  submit  the  IEE  to  ADB  for  approval.  For\nrehabilitation  works  involving  resettlement,  the  BWDB  will  prepare  and  submit  a  brief", "47\nAppendix 5, page 4\nresettlement plan to ADB conforming to ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, for ADB\napproval before implementation of subprojects.\n11. BWDB will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB and within three months of the\ncompletion of the Project, a project completion report. BWDB will maintain separate accounts\nand records of expenditures for the Project. The accounts will be audited annually by the\nGovernment\u2019s auditor general, and certified copies of the audited financial statements and the\nrelated auditor general\u2019s report will be furnished to ADB not later than 12 months after the end\nof each related fiscal year.\n5. Procurement\n12. As the project sites are scattered in remote areas, and have relatively small civil works\ncontracts, the civil works are unlikely to attract the interest of international contractors. It has\nbeen confirmed that domestic contractors have the capacity and capability to undertake such\ncontracts, and the procedures to be followed for domestic procurement are acceptable to ADB.\nAs such, BWDB\u2019s local competitive bidding procedures, which are acceptable to ADB, will be\nfollowed for civil works contracts. To encourage the participation of local residents (especially\nwomen) and provide them with employment opportunities, civil works for small earthworks,\nestimated to cost $2,500 or less in each case, may be awarded to labor contracting societies in\naccordance  with  BWDB\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures,  including  force  account,\nacceptable to ADB.\n6. Retroactive Financing\n13. Retroactive financing is essential to fully utilize the working season from November 2000\nto June 2001, and to completely restore critical facilities before the next rainy season. The\nProject therefore provides for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures incurred after the\ndate of appraisal (15 November 2000) provided that it is certified by consultants acceptable to\nADB. Retroactive financing will be approved under the following conditions: (i) the consultants\nare in the field; (ii) the contract has been approved by ADB; and (iii) works are tendered\naccording to agreed procedures acceptable to ADB and certified by the consultants. Retroactive\nfinancing for consultants\u2019 services has also been requested and agreed for any expenditures\nincurred after the date of appraisal.  Retroactive financing will not exceed 10 percent of the loan\namount allocated to each project component.  The Government has been advised that provision\nfor retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.\n7. Implementation Schedule\n14. Part D of the Project is expected to be implemented over two years. Most civil works are\nexpected to start in February 2001 and be completed by June 2001, but the works that require\nsurvey and design, should be completed by June 2002.\n8. Consulting Services\n15. Given the urgency of the Project, ADB will approve advance action for the recruitment of\nconsultants. The Government has been advised that such advance action does not commit\nADB to finance any part of the Project. BWDB will require two domestic consultants to design\nand supervise the reconstruction of flood-damaged facilities, a team leader and civil engineer,\nand a domestic construction supervision expert for 16 person-months each to help with project", "48\nAppendix 5, page 5\nimplementation over a 19-month period. In view of the emergency nature of the Project, the\nconsultants will be recruited immediately through direct appointment by the project director to\nallow the maximum use of the present construction season. Conditions for direct selection\ninclude (i) the consultants have experience in a similar project in the southwest region; (ii) have\nneeded expertise available at short notice, and (iii) have been selected for an ADB-financed\nproject following ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n16. The consulting firm engaged under the Project will provide project management and\nengineering services to assist BWDB.  The services will include (i) project coordination and\nadministration, (ii) assistance to BWDB for project coordination and implementation, (iii) help\nwith  engineering  design  and  construction  supervision,  (iv)  midterm  project  review,  and  (v)\nprogress monitoring and reporting to ADB and the project steering committee. These services\nrelate to the rehabilitation of the flood control and drainage facilities damaged during the 2000\nfloods.\n9. Terms of Reference for Team Leader and Civil Engineer\n17. The consultant, as the team leader, will help BWDB:\n(i)  coordinate project activities of BWDB staff concerned;\n(ii)  prepare and update yearly work plans, budgets, and financing plans;\n(iii)  verify necessary documentation for loan withdrawals;\n(iv)  compile and certify reimbursement applications;\n(v)  maintain contract files;\n(vi)  assess the flood damage;\n(vii)  identify measures to be taken;\n(viii)  review  BWDB\u2019s design drawings and tender documents;\n(ix)  ensure  that  proposed  rehabilitation  works  are  environmentally  sound,  and\nincorporate  mitigation  measures  as  appropriate  to  meet  Government\nenvironmental standards and regulations;\n(x)  supervise construction of the civil works under the Project; and\n(xi)  check and certify progress payments bills and all final bills, prior to payment\nbeing made to contractors.\n18.

If  the  deficiency  is  not  corrected,  the  payment  for  the\ncorresponding part of the works will not be certified for reimbursement.", "49\nAppendix 5, page 6\n19. The consultant will be responsible for monitoring design and construction work to ensure\nthat beneficiaries will participate in the planning and construction of them to the maximum\nextent.

Small-Scale Works\n21. Flood damage of small-scale water control structures was relatively minor because of\ntheir small scale and the small number of completed schemes. The main causes of damage\nwere heavy inflow to canal embankments and scouring around water control structures.", "50\nAppendix 5, page 7\n22. The ADB-financed Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project1 covers\nthe entire western half of the country. Flood damage on small-scale works in the region is\nestimated at $0.37 million.

Background1\n1. The Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) of Poverty Foundation will be the apex\nmicrocredit  organization  managing  the  socioeconomic  rehabilitation  fund  (SRF)  under  the\nProject.  PKSF  was  established  in  May  1990  under  the  Companies  Act  of  1913  as  an\nautonomous,  nonprofit  organization  charged  with  \u201chelping  the  poor,  the  landless,  and  the\nassetless  in  order  to  enable  them  to  gain  access  to  resources  for  their  productive  self-\nemployment,  to  encourage  them  to  undertake  activities  of  icome  generation  and  poverty\nalleviation for enhancing their quality of life.\u201d  The formation of PKSF was prompted by the fact\nthat  a  number  of  small  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  were  engaged  in  promoting\nincome-generating activities within their local areas in Bangladesh. Although many of these\nNGOs were competently managed, they generally suffered from a perennial shortage of funds.\nPKSF was thus formed to finance such NGOs. In support of this objective, PKSF received an\ninitial grant of Tk32.0 million from the Government, and it has subsequently received additional\ngrants from the Government for a total of Tk750.0 million.  At the end of 1999, the total equity of\nPKSF was Tk5,920.0 million.  While PKSF functions as an autonomous publicly funded body, it\nfalls under the overall supervision of the Ministry of Finance.  PKSF is the apex organization for\nthe 1996 Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project of the World Bank and the International\nDevelopment  Association,  as  well  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Participatory\nLivestock Development Project in 1997.\n2. The principal objectives of PKSF are to help the poor by providing them with resources\nfor the creation of productive self-employment opportunities. This is achieved by (i) providing\ncredit to various organizations (government or nongovernment) that are engaged in promoting\nsuch  income  generation  activities  for  the  poor;  (ii)  providing  institutional  strength  of  these\norganizations; (iii) encouraging new ideas, generating new technologies for poverty reduction,\nand  initiating  and  undertaking  research  activities;  and  (iv)  developing  proper  management\ninformation systems, so that poverty reduction  activities can be monitored and evaluated in a\nregular manner.\nB. Organization\n3. The  General  Body  of  PKSF  provides  overall  policy  guidance,  approves  the  annual\nbudget, and reviews the annual report and audited accounts of PKSF. The General Body may\nhave up to 25 members (with up to 15 members being Government employees), all of whom are\nappointed, and may be replaced at any time, by the Government. The nongovernment members\nare based on their record of service with respect to poverty reduction and income generation\nactivities  for  the  poor.  In  addition,  the  seven-member  Governing  Board  comprises  the\nchairperson,  managing  director,  and  five  other  members.  The  chairperson  and  two  other\nmembers are appointed by the Governme5n2t, but in late 1995, PKSF\u2019s Memorandum of Articles\nwas changed to give its Governing Board full authority. The other three board members are\nselected by the private sector members of the General Body, and represent knowledgeable\nprofessionals with an interest in the field of NGO activities and poverty reduction.  The seven\nboard members hold all the shares of PKSF, equitably.\n4. Two general managers, one for operations and the other for administration, support the\nmanaging director. The operations wing of PKSF is responsible for the initial screening of\n                                                \n1 Drawn from PKSF. 1999. Annual Report, 1998-1999. Dhaka.", "52\nAppendix 6, page 2\norganizations applying for registration as partner organizations (POs); the initial screening of\nloan applications for authorizing disbursements; and for tracking scheduled compared with\nactual repayments.  The key functionaries in operations are the loan officers who maintain close\nlinks with their POs through regular field visits. The administration wing includes separate\nsectors  for  finance,  administration,  and  internal  audit.  The  managing  director  and  general\nmanagers control credit operations by forming a loan committee, which includes the loan officer\nin  addition  to  these  three  senior  managers,  and  which  reviews  PO  registration  and  loan\napplications forwarded by the loan officer.\nC. Activities\n5. PKSF\u2019s activities largely focus on ensuring a rigorous screening of applications for\nvarious  NGOs  for  registration  as  POs,  and  the  subsequent  processing  of  loan  approvals,\ndisbursements, and repayments. This work involves regular field visits by loan officers. In\naddition, PKSF has provided technical assistance for the institutional strengthening of the POs,\nprimarily focusing on ensuring a uniform system of accounting and controls for the POs\u2019 credit\nactivities.  Management  information  systems  (MIS)  need  to  be  strengthened  to  ensure\ntransparency; this is being achieved through technical assistance provided under the Poverty\nAlleviation Microfinance Project.\nD. Procedures\n6. PKSF\u2019s credit operations center around the loan officers in the operation wing, each of\nwhom has clear responsibility for individual POs. Organizations seeking to register as POs\ncomplete a comprehensive application form, providing information about their own financial\nstatus, as well as the status of the borrower groups they service. This is supplemented by field\nvisits by a loan officer to verify the information provided. Applications approved by the loan\nofficer are then reviewed by the Loan Committee and presented to the Governing Body for\napproval. The loan officer, who then forwards them to the Loan Committee for final approval,\nsimilarly clears loan applications. Supervision is performed by reviewing cash flow statements\n(supported  by  bank  statements)  and  summaries  of  credit  transactions  between  PO  and\nborrower groups submitted each month by the POs to PKSF. In addition, the loan officers make\nfield visits once every two or three months.\nE. Priorities\n7. PKSF\u2019s overall operating policies and procedures are satisfactory. Its credit approval\npolicies are sound and conservative, credit supervision is intensive, accounting systems and the\nMIS are satisfactory, and its own external audit is quite comprehensive.  PKSF\u2019s main focus for\nits  borrowers  is  on  collecting  loans,  which  have  averaged  99.8  percent  since  inception;\nmaintaining  satisfactory  bookkeeping  of  disbursements  and  repayments;  routing  of  PKSF-\nfinanced transactions through banks; and ensuring that loans are made to the target group.\nMicrocredit financing institutions (MFIs) are required to conduct all transactions of PKSF-funded\n53\nprograms through banks, and submit monthly bank statements and MIS reports. Loans are\napproved on the basis of the annual needs of MFIs, but disbursed, generally, at intervals of 1-2\nmonths, after field supervision and bank statements confirm that the last transaction has been\nsatisfactorily used. To strengthen its monitoring, and internal accountability capabilities, PKSF\nhas recently established an internal audit cell.\n8. PKSF encourages its POs to at least (i) fully cover the recurring administrative and\nfunding costs from operating income; (ii) impose a minimum lending rate of 16 percent to ensure", "53\nAppendix 6, page 3\nthat they do not lend below commercial bank rates; and (iii) promote cost recovery operations.\nPKSF does not impose any other specific performance or sustainability targets. PKSF\u2019s main\nobjective  is  to  ensure  accountability  for  its  funds.  As  long  as  the  POs  meet  its  stringent\nrequirements for repayment, accounting, and targeting, PKSF neither monitors nor imposes its\nview on POs product mix, cross-subsidization of nonlending services from lending profits or\nlending services from grants and other income, loan pricing and loan-loss reserve policies, level\nof mandatory savings, separation of accounts for different services, etc. PKSF encourages, but\ndoes not mandate, POs that have outside sources of income to set aside a portion of interest\nincome as reserves.  Considering the pervasive loan default situation in Bangladesh, the high\npriority attached by PKSF to loan collection is well placed and should remain as its predominant\nconcern. In addition, but without sacrificing this emphasis, PKSF needs to pay attention to\nissues of sustainability and its own role as an apex institution.\nF. Funding of PKSF\n9. PKSF\u2019s mandate authorizes PKSF management to mobilize funds in the form of grants,\nloans, and contributions from a wide variety of sources, which include the Government, private\nindividuals and organizations, foreign governments, international funding and lending agencies,\nand capital markets. PKSF received in total Tk1,100.0 million as a grant from the Government\nand Tk650.0 million from United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and\n$100 million as loan from International Development Association (IDA) through the Government\nfor the  Poverty Alleviation Microcredit Project. PKSF also received a grant of $4.8 million from\nthe Government for institutional development under the microcredit project.  PKSF also received\na loan of Tk17.5 million from the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs under IFADEP-I project\nand $18.0 million from ADB for the Participatory Livestock Development Project.\nG. Operations:  Performance and Projections\n1. Lending\n10. PKSF has now enlisted over 182 POs as borrowers. PKSF\u2019s gross disbursements to\nPOs rose from Tk3.0 million in financial year 1991 (second year of operations for PKSF) to Tk1,\n987.0 million in 1999, the average annual growth rate was as high as 125.2 percent.2 As of June\n1999, the total cumulative amount of loan disbursed by PKSF was Tk5,665.0 million. PKSF has\nbeen able to maintain a loan recovery rate above 98 percent from its POs. Up to June 1999, the\ntotal  cumulative  amount  of  loan  recovered  (principal  amount)  was  Tk1,526.0  million  and\nTk4,138.0 million remained outstanding as loans to the POs.\n2. Financial Outlook\n11. Projections indicate that after 2000, along with the evolution of the MFI sector and with\nmore  MFIs  achieving  financial  viability,  as  well  as  PKSF  having  built  up  a  large  pool  of\nconcessional  funds,  reducing  concessionality  in  interest  rates  (both  on  the  borrowing  and\nlending side) should be possible over time. Thus, PKSF could start to pay higher rates on\nincremental borrowings, and by 2015 it could pay an interest rate of 8 percent (7 percent higher\nthan at present and 2 percent higher than the average cost of funds of the banking system) on\nall its borrowed funds, and earn a satisfactory 1.9 percent return on assets, while raising the\naverage lending rate only 4 percent points, from 4.5 percent in 2000 to 8.5 percent in 2015.\nBecause of the higher cost of funding, the average interest expense (a percentage of borrowed\n                                                \n2 All years in paras. 9-10 are financial years.", "54\nAppendix 6, page 4\nfunds) increased from 1.0 percent in 2000 to 6.2 percent in 2015. The favorable debt-equity\nratio of 7.7:1 in 2015 enables PKSF to operate on a thin interest margin and yet earn a\nsatisfactory return on assets.  By 2015, PKSF would be earning a return on equity of about 15\npercent, which should be sufficient to attract private capital.\nH. The Socioeconomic Rehabilitation Fund\n12. Part E of the Southwest Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project involves setting up the\nSRF in PKSF.  The objective of the SRF is to mitigate the social and economic impact of floods\nand  to  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  poor  through  speedy  provision  of  loans  for\nrehabilitation of village reconstruction and settlement development, and on- and off-farm income\ngenerating activities. In addition, the SRF will strengthen decentralized delivery mechanisms by\nsupporting local (government and nongovernment) organizations that are responsive to local\nneeds, and build local institutional capacity.\n13. The scope of activities funded by the SRF will be based on beneficiaries\u2019 demand and\nthe implementation capacity of the POs. Community participation, demand orientation, and local\norganizational capacity will be used as guiding principles in SRF activities. These principles will\nbe reflected in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the SRF. NGO involvement,\nparticularly local NGOs, will enable the SRF to reach poor and isolated communities, enhance\ncommunity participation, and improve project design and implementation.\n14. PKSF will develop a detailed design for the SRF, including lending terms, recovery\nmechanisms, and monitoring and reporting arrangements. The following parameters will be\nused to develop the SRF.\n15. All  POs  must  direct  SRF  resources  to  borrower  groups  of  the  poor.  First-time\nbeneficiaries of the POs will be persons who fulfill the following eligibility criteria, as usually\napplied by PKSF, or other criteria as agreed to by PKSF and POs from time to time: (i) are a\npermanent resident in the project area; (ii) have total assets not exceeding the value of 0.4\nhectares of arable land in their locality; and (iii) are members of a savings group organized and\nmonitored by the PO directly.  Preference will be given to poor households whose houses were\ndestroyed  by  the  recent  floods.  Loans  by  POs  to  the  final  borrowers  will  be  provided  on\ngenerous terms (at no more than 3-5 percent) and for substantially longer periods than normal,\nreflecting the disaster nature of the facility. PKSF will provide loans to the POs at 1.5 percent,\nrepayable in liberal installments.\n16. In  view  of  the  high  cost  of  both  supervised  microcredit  and  social  intermediation\nactivities, the Government has agreed that part of the concessionality of ADB\u2019s loan will be used\nto provide an adequate interest spread to cover all costs and provision for bad and doubtful\ndebts. The Government will relend on an interest-free basis, $10.0 million equivalent under the\nProject to PKSF for the SRF. The Government loan to PKSF will be amortized over 32 years\nwith a grace period of 8 years to allow (i) the fund to be replenished, (ii) a revolving fund to be\nestablished with repayments, and (iii) the fund to be applied to any future disaster.\n17.  PKSF will designate, within one month after the ADB loan becomes effective, a full-time\nproject  coordinator  with  qualifications  and  experience  acceptable  to  ADB  to  oversee  the\nimplementation of the SRF component.  PKSF will also provide an adequate number of suitable\nqualified  professional  and  support  staff  to  assist  the  project  coordinator  to  carry  out  the\nimplementation of the SRF component and monitor its subloans to POs.", "55\nAppendix 7\nAGRICULTURE\nA. Damage and Impact\n1. The unprecedented flood, which started in the third week of September, engulfed six\nsouthwest districts of Bangladesh: Chuadanga, Jessore, Jhenaidaha, Kushtia, Meherpur and\nSatkhira resulting a complete loss of about 150,000 hectares of standing crops. The main crops\n\u2014 aman and horticulture \u2014 were under water and the farmers did not have means to protect\nthe seeds of rabi crops, mainly boro paddy, vegetable, and spices. The total production loss is\nabout 420,000 metric tons of rice and vegetables worth Tk4,600 million ($83.64 million). About\n130,000  hectares  of  aman  paddy  and  24,000  hectares  of  summer  vegetables  have  been\ncompletely  damaged.  Other  flood-prone  horticultural  crops,  particularly  banana,  papaya,\njackfruit, and tuberose were also affected to a great extent. Five seed multiplication farms were\ndamaged. The flood has affected not only the landowners who have lost their crops, but also\nmany of the functionally landless, who are dependent on agricultural employment during the\nharvesting season. The seed multiplication farms need to be rehabilitated urgently to supply\nseeds to the affected farms for coming cropping seasons.\nB. Scope\n2. Part F of the Project will comprise rehabilitation of flood-damaged seed, multiplication\nfarms, and associated facilities in the seven affected districts (Chuadanga, Jessore, Jhenaidah,\nKushtia, Magura, Meherpur and Satkhira).\nC. Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n3. The total cost is estimated at  $0.6 million equivalent in local currency.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n4. The Executing Agency for the component will be the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The\nImplementing Agency will be the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC)\nwithin  MOA.  BADC  has  implemented  many  post-flood  agricultural  rehabilitation  projects\nsupported by the Government and development partners. The performance of BADC in those\nprojects has been found satisfactory. It is considered  BADC is considered to be capable of\nimplementing the component successfully with support from MOA.\nE. Retroactive Financing\n5. To utilize the ensuing rabi and boro cropping season from November 2000 to April 2001,\nretroactive financing will be essential.\nF. Implementation Schedule\n6. It is expected that Part F of the Project will be implemented over six months from\nNovember 2000 to April 2001.", "56\nAppendix 8\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\nSubproject Foreign Local Total\nCurrency Currency\n1.

Background\n1. The Project will restore and rehabilitate public and community infrastructure facilities in\nsix districts of southwest Bangladesh that were damaged by the recent flood, and restore\nsocioeconomic conditions of flood victims by providing of microcredit.  The project area is mostly\npoor and poverty levels are very high. The Project will enable the restoration of social and\neconomic activities of these six districts, and create opportunities for employment or income-\ngeneration, particularly for poor men and women through labor-intensive activities.\nB. The Project Area\n2. The project area is located in the southwestern region of Bangladesh, and comprises\nseven districts: Chuadanga, Jessore, Jhenidah, Kusthia, Magura, Meherpur, and Satkhira. It\ncovers about 11,103 square kilometers (km2) of mixed use land, and has a population of\napproximately 8 million. The total affected area is 3,239 km2 with population of 2 million-3 million\npeople. The affected areas have not experienced flooding for the last 60 years. Poor rural and\nurban infrastructures and poor living conditions (i.e., mud houses) characterize the area.\n3. Due to the heavy rainfall in West Bengal State, water flows from the upper catchment\nareas of India, and heavy rainfall in southwestern Bangladesh, the project area was flooded to\nan average depth of 1.8 to 3.0 meters within a few days. About 80-90 percent of mud houses in\nthe area were damaged. In Satkhira, at least 500,000 people were rendered homeless as the\nunprecedented floods destroyed some 68,000 houses completely and some 47,000 houses\npartially. Over 600,000 people in this district alone took shelter in schools, colleges, madrasahs,\nand other public places.\n4. Most of social infrastructure facilities such as schools and health centers have not\nsurvived the floods and will need to be reconstructed. A large number of tube wells have been\ninundated and most will likely need to be resunk. Damage to crops and infrastructure was\nsubstantial. The standing aman rice (harvest due in November) and summer vegetable and fruit\ncrops were seriously affected by the flood. The damage to rural roads and embankments is\nsubstantial. While the damage to national and regional highways is less severe, resources will\nhave to be spent on reconstructing culverts and bridges, particularly at places where the roads\nhad to be cut or were breached by floodwaters.\nC. Methodology\n5. During appraisal, an in-depth needs assessment was fielded involving consultations with\nkey  stakeholders  in  six  districts  that  included  union  parishad  members,  schoolteachers,\nnongovernment  agencies  (NGO)  representatives,  farmers,  shop  owners,  landowners,  and\npeople who were most adversely affected by the floods in the project area. Consultations and a\nseries of meetings were conducted with key stakeholders including international and national\nNGOs, government officials, and assistance agencies working in the field.\n6. Together  with  stakeholders,  the  needs  assessment  team  identified  the  needs  and\ndemands of communities; magnitude of socioeconomic impacts; types of programs in place to\nserve  poor  and  marginalized  groups,  including  the  role  of  Government;  role  of  local\norganizations  in  supporting  poor  flood  victims;  and  delivery  mechanisms  for  a  social", "60\nAppendix 10, page 2\nrehabilitation fund (SRF).  NGOs, local community leaders, and local government staff also\nprovided inputs to the proposed design of the SRF to be funded under the Project, and criteria\nfor selection of intermediary agencies.\nD. Poverty Profile\n1. National Levels\n7. Nearly 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s population of 130 million people live in rural areas.\nThe  most  recent  countrywide  evidence  on  the  poverty  status1  shows  that  36  percent  of\nBangladesh\u2019s population are very poor and 53 percent poor.2 The incidence of poverty has\ndeclined since 1991-1992 as measured by both the lower and upper poverty lines. However, the\ndrop in poverty was larger in urban than rural areas.  For the decade from 1985 through 1995,\nrural poverty has remained much higher than urban poverty as measured with both the lower\nand upper lines. In Bangladesh, poverty can be regarded as both a state of deprivation as well\nas a state of vulnerability. The rapid population growth rate, at about 2 percent annually, is\ncontributing to increasing landlessness; in 1995/96, nearly half of all rural households were\nreported as being landless or near-landless, owning less than 0.2 hectare; 17 percent of these\nhouseholds were reported as being completely landless.\n8. While poverty is best measured by comparing per capita consumption to a poverty line,\nother dimensions of well-being are not captured by such measures.  Women in Bangladesh lack\naccess to health and education, and have a lower life expectancy than men at birth. Rural\nhouseholds headed by women had a higher probability of being among the very poor than\nhouseholds headed by men (45 percent compared with 39 percent). The headcount ratios for\npoor  households  were  virtually  identical  for  households  headed  by  females  and  males.\nBecause households headed by females had smaller families and per capita consumption data\nwas used as a welfare indicator, poverty among smaller families was underestimated compared\nwith larger families, and in households headed by women3. If the distribution of consumption\nwithin households favors men, poverty among women is likely to be higher still.\n9. In  Bangladesh,  the  burden  of  poverty  falls  disproportionately  on  women.  The  most\ndisadvantaged women are those heading or managing households, about 15 percent of all\nhouseholds.  On average, households headed by females earn only 55 percent of the earnings\nof the national average households.  About 96 percent of these households are living below the\npoverty line, while 33 percent are living below the lower poverty line and thus experience\nchronic of food shortages.\n10. Poor  Bangladeshis  have  little  access  to  resources.  In  rural  areas,  poor  people,\nparticularly women, generally access financial resources through nonbank sources, such as\nmicrocredit programs of NGOs and other noninstitutional lending sources. The Grameen Bank\nand some NGO credit programs, such as Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), Bangladesh\nRural Advancement Committee (BRAC), and Proshika provide loans to poor people and target\n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 1998.

Dhaka.", "61\nAppendix 10, page 3\nwomen specifically.  Loans taken by poor people often are to support economic activities, but\noften are also taken for consumption and household purposes in times of distress.\n2. Poverty in Project Area\n11. Prior to the floods, the level of poverty in the southwest region was lower than in other\nparts of Bangladesh. With massive income erosion and complete loss of physical assets, the\naffected areas now face abject poverty. The prevalence of poverty among landless households\nand households headed by women is particularly high. The estimated number of vulnerable\ngroups (such as children under 5 years age, pregnant mothers, and elderly people) among the\ntotal population is approximately 22 percent.\n12. A rapid poverty assessment was conducted in the project area during appraisal. Most of\nthe people of the project area are involved in agricultural production either directly or indirectly.\nAbout 27 percent of the population in the region are literate. The proportion of literacy among\nmales (67 percent) is more than double the literacy among females (33 percent). In the project\narea, women\u2019s labor is engaged in traditional household works: agriculture, fishing, petty trade,\nand some low-level nonfarm jobs. The lower the status of the families (landless and marginal),\nthe higher the percentage of women involved in activities other than household works.\n13. Persistent  waterlogging  problems  exist  in  many  areas,  creating  inhuman  living\nconditions, spread of diseases, and lack of employment opportunities. The clean water supply\nsituation  is  insufficient  and  latrines  are  scarce.  A  major  concern  is  the  situation  after  the\nrecession  of  floodwaters  when  the  risk  of  epidemics,  particularly  diarrhea  as  well  as  skin\ndiseases, will be high.  Thus, social issues, such as provision of a safety net for affected people,\nparticularly the poor and vulnerable groups, have emerged as major issues.\nD. Project Beneficiaries\n14. Through the rehabilitation of public and community infrastructure, the Project will help\nrestore social and economic activities disrupted by the flood. The Project will reduce flooding\nand waterlogging of agricultural land, benefiting residents and farmers in low-lying flood-prone\nareas. Improved water and sanitation facilities will help reduce risk of health-related problems\nand improved quality of life. Aside from relieving human and societal distress, the Project will\nhave economic benefits that are likely to be substantial although perhaps not quantifiable. The\ncivil works under the Project are expected to provide employment of about 262,500 person-days\nto local skilled and unskilled labor. The Project will help bring the farmlands and in six districts\nback to productivity and allow people to regain employment and to generate incomes of their\nown instead of relying on government emergency assistance.

The  project  component  with  the  greatest  potential  to  impact  on  existing  poverty\nconditions  within  the  project  area  is  the  Socioeconomic  Rehabilitation  Fund  (SRF)  to  be\nimplemented in six districts. Based on the poverty assessment, approximately 45 percent of\npeople who live in these districts are living below the official poverty level.\nE. Needs and Demands for Infrastructure Development\n16. Approximately 80-90 percent of houses in these areas are made from mud, and the\npopulation in the flooded areas appears to be most exposed to the elements. Most of those\nbuildings did not survive the floods and will need to be reconstructed. Damage to crops and\ninfrastructure was substantial. The standing aman rice (harvest due in November) and summer\nvegetable and fruit crops were seriously affected by floods. A large number of tubewells have\nbeen inundated and will need to be rehabilitated. Based on community consultations, the major\ndemand were (i) drainage rehabilitation; (ii) housing; (iii) working capital for on- and off-farm,\nincome-generating  activities;  (iv)  employment;  (v)  rehabilitation  of  rural  and  urban  basic\ninfrastructure facilities, such as roads, schools, tube wells, community health centers, and\nirrigation facilities.\nF. Role of NGOs\n17. Bangladesh is internationally known for its innovative NGOs, which have grown rapidly.\nIn the project area, NGOs play a major role in providing relief programs for flood victims such as", "63\nAppendix 10, page 5\ntemporary shelters, food distribution, health, water supply, and sanitation facilities. Microfinance\nprograms such as those provided by Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC),\nAssociation for Social Advancement (ASA), Proshika, Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF),\nand Grameen Bank are among the best known. In addition to microfinance, NGOs provide skill\ntraining, education, health, family planning, and water supply and sanitation facilities. NGOs are\nalso active in managing common property resources, extending nontraditional agriculture, and\ninitiating income-generating activities. Microfinance programs are effective in fighting poverty.\nThe superior performance of microfinance NGO services offers possibilities of partnership with\nthe Government to provide loans for housing, and working capital for on- and off-farm, income-\ngenerating activities for flood victims, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups.\nG. Project Impact on Women\n18. The various project components will benefit women in a number of ways. Bangladeshi\nwomen have high labor force participation rates, many earn their incomes from agricultural\nwage labor, trading activities in the home or the markets. The Project will benefit women by\nproviding employment opportunities for rehabilitation of public and community infrastructure\nfacilities. The provision of community water and sanitation facilities will benefit women and\nchildren substantially in terms of health and quality of life.\n19. Gender considerations have been built into the design of the Project to ensure equitable\naccess to employment creation and poverty reduction opportunities, as well as to ensure that\nthe  perspective  and  needs  of  the  entire  community  are  reflected  in  the  planning  and\nimplementation process, particularly in the SRF. Furthermore, an important contribution of the\nSRF component will be empowerment of women in the project area. The SRF will incorporate\nparticipatory approaches involving civil society at various stages of the development process,\nfrom planning to implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. The SRF requires that women\nparticipate in a meaningful way both at decision-making levels and as beneficiaries of the labor\nrequired by the Project. As participants, they will represent their respective communities in the\ndecision-making process. This makes them accountable to their respective communities, and\nthey will therefore become public figures. This experience will help empower women, and\npromote their needs in the village.\nH. Impact on Poor Households\n20. Construction activities, which mostly require unskilled labor, will generate direct income-\nearning  opportunities  particularly  for  the  poor.  Over  three  years,  the  Project  will  provide\napproximately 652,500 person-days of employment, which consist of direct labor in civil works\nand production of materials utilized in constructing the works. Poverty targeting will be achieved\nat the village level through community selection, e.g., communities will be able to identify the\nneedy (the very poor) more efficiently than through any objective screening mechanisms.  The\nparticipatory project monitoring and evaluation system to be developed and implemented under\nthe  SRF  component  will  require  each  district  and  village  to  make  plans,  and  monitor  the\nimplementation of that plan, for promoting access of the poor to project benefits.\nI. Community Consultation and Participatory Approaches\n21. The communities that will be directly and indirectly benefited by the project components\nwill play a significant part in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of the Project. The\nbottom-up planning process will be a major feature of the SRF. During the social and poverty", "64\nAppendix 10, page 6\nassessment, discussions were held with a number of relevant stakeholders such as union\nparishad, local NGOs, communities, and particularly poor men and women. The discussions\nhelped to highlight issues faced by the communities.  For instance, to reduce the health risk,\ncommunities must have clean water and sanitation facilities. Participatory approaches will be\nemployed in design, implementation, and monitoring of the Project.\nJ. Performance Project Monitoring System (PPMS)\n22. The specific objectives of PPMS are to identify key criteria and indicators to be used for\nmacro-level  monitoring  of  project  inputs,  outputs,  and  impacts.  The  PPMS  will  enable  the\nExecuting  Agency  and  ADB  to  determine  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  project\nimplementation, to identify constraints, and to compare performance and impact across six\ndistricts. The PPMS will be established to assess the Project\u2019s progress and implementation\nand to measure the impact and outcomes of the Project.  The information obtained will be used\ndirectly to improve development planning and implementation by adjusting delivery mechanisms\nand identifying more appropriate strategies."], "metadata": {"Author": "jm9", "CreationDate": "D:20010125161653Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131111144733+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R307-00rrp.doc"}}
