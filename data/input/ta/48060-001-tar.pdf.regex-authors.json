INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission for Mongolia on 17\u201320 February 2014, the \ngovernment requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) in conducting a national country water security assessment (CWSA). \nThe TA was included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.1 ADB and the \nGovernment of Mongolia agreed on the TA\u2019s scope, impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements,  financing  and  cost  estimates,  and  terms  of  reference.  Multi-stakeholder \ndiscussions were held during a consultation mission from 13 to 15 August 2014. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia has an extreme cool continental climate with long, cold winters. Most of the \nprecipitation falls during the short summers. Spatial variability in rainfall is large.3 Mongolia\u2019s \nannual renewable surface water resources are plentiful, but are scattered over large areas, \nmainly in the northern part of the country. Most water resources are not readily accessible for \nmajor  population  centers,  mining  operations,  and  other  industrial  operations.  As  a  result, \nMongolia has many localized water stress situations. For example, there is high dependence on \ngroundwater  in  the  South  Gobi;  an  increasing  dependence  on  recharged  groundwater  for \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s water supply with potential problems during winter and spring months; and it is \ndifficult and costly to transport resources across the vast country. These potentially large in-\nregion and in-basin deficits constrain Mongolia\u2019s economic and social development.4  \n \n3.   Development in Mongolia has also been greatly influenced by the country\u2019s rapid rate of \nurbanization. By the end of 2008, about 1.66 million people (roughly 60% of the total population) \nwere  living  in  urban  areas  in  Mongolia.  Increased  demand  by  residential  and  commercial \nconsumers for urban services (water supply and sanitation) has outstripped supply, particularly \nin  Ulaanbaatar  and  in  aimag  (province)  centers.  Mongolia\u2019s  fastest-growing  urban  area  is \nUlaanbaatar.  The  continued  growth  of  Ulaanbaatar  in  conjunction  with  increasing  urban \nconsumption is projected to lead to water shortages as early as 2015. In addition, Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \nwater security is challenged by three factors. Industrial pollution is high, particularly due to \ndischarges with high pollution levels (e.g., tanneries). Wastewater treatment is ineffective, with \nno recycling of wastewater. Finally, seasonal variation in Tuul River\u2019s water level results in lower \ngroundwater levels in spring. The threat to water security has become a constraint on economic \ngrowth. \n \n4.  Mongolia is already seeing the impacts of climate change. Natural disasters such as \ndrought, heavy snowfall, flood, and wind storms, and extreme cold and hot temperatures are \nbecoming more and more frequent. The future under a climate change scenario is uncertain, but \nclimate models predict a decrease in river water levels, higher seasonal variations, and a \ndecrease in groundwater levels due to reduced recharge.  \n \n5.  Government policies  are  placing  emphasis  on  the  mining  sector  as  a key  driver  of \nnational  economic  development.  Extensive  water-intensive  mining  activities  are  inducing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 October 2014. \n3  The annual average precipitation amount is around 200 to 220 millimeters, ranging from 38.4 millimeters in some \nparts of the Gobi desert region to about 400 millimeters in some areas in the north.  \n4  Ulaanbaatar obtains around 98% of its water from groundwater. \n ", "2   \nregional  restructuring of  economic  development and  consequently  influencing  demographics \nthroughout  Mongolia,  increasing  environmental  vulnerability,  and heightening  water  security \n(both quality and quantity) risks. Mongolia\u2019s future development rests heavily on its water\u2013\nenergy\u2013food nexus. Moving toward energy security and food security will require a considerable \namount of its scarce water resources. Increasing urbanization and population growth, natural \ndisaster risks, and energy and agricultural development projects may lead to unsustainable \nwater use and conflicts among users. It is imperative to establish proper policies and planning, \nadaptation strategies, and mitigation measures for climate change. Managing Mongolia\u2019s energy \nsecurity problems (particularly for mining and hydropower) and rising demands on food security \nwill make water management even more critical in harnessing socioeconomic development. \n \n6.  The government is putting significant attention on improving its legal and institutional \nframework for integrated water resource management and environmental protection of river \nbasins in Mongolia. The Water Law (2012) serves as an umbrella law for water resources \nmanagement,  providing  a  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM).5 In 2010, Mongolia was divided into 29 river basins to improve water \nresources  management.  Introducing  the  concepts  of  river  basin  councils  and  river  basin \nauthorities  paved  the  way  for  decentralization  and  community  involvement  in  water \nmanagement. The Water Law formally established river basin authorities throughout the country \nstarting  in  2012.6 The  government  also  approved  a  National  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement Plan, under which 13 basin-level IWRM plans were prepared to date.7 However, \nmany institutional challenges remain to be overcome, such as the need for (i) intergovernment \ncoordination; (ii) stronger stakeholder coordination through river basin councils; (iii) better data \ncollection, monitoring, and management (now dispersed and poorly managed); (iv) finances for \neffective execution of water management; and (v) better-trained water management personnel. \nAlthough a number of studies on water resources and water management exist and provide \nsome background information on a few aspects of water resources management and water \nsecurity in Mongolia, there are issues of poor data quality and lack of information in a number of \nkey assessment areas including (i) water intensity in industry, (ii) water related natural disasters, \n(iii) water for energy and energy for water, (iv) environment and ecosystem health, and (v) \ntracking water governance. To address these issues, the government of Mongolia recognizes \nthe need to employ more rigorous and systematic approaches to comprehensively understand \nwater security \n \n7.  The  Asian  Water  Development  Outlook  2013 8  measures  water  security  in  five \ndimensions:  household  water  security,  economic  water  security,  urban  water  security, \nenvironmental  water  security,  and resilience to  water-related  disasters. This five-dimension \nframework provides a good basis for the regional developing member countries to conduct \ncountry water security assessment. \n \n8.  Given rapidly changing growth dynamics and the pressing need to integrate sustainable \ndevelopment planning, ADB and the government have agreed to conduct a CWSA for Mongolia. \nThis assessment will adopt the five-dimension framework which is presented in Asian Water \n                                                \n5  Ministry of Environment and Green Development. 2012. Integrated Water Management National Assessment \nReport. Ulaanbaatar.    \n6  As of 2013, river basin authorities had been established for 23 of the 29 river basins. \n7  Within this new legal and institutional framework, ADB is currently preparing a project to assist the Tuul River Basin \nAuthority with implementation of its IWRM plan. The Proposed Loan for Tuul River Cleanup and Rehabilitation for \nMongolia is under processing and is expected to be approved in 2015. \n8  ADB. 2013. Asian Water Development Outlook. Manila. \n ", "  3 \nDevelopment Outlook. The proposed TA for the CWSA will be used to improve policies and \nstrategies in the water sector, particularly to improve national water security and deal with water \nscarcity. The Mongolia CWSA will also support the preparation of a national water security \nmanagement strategy, and will ensure that ADB\u2019s strategy and programs respond to water \nsecurity challenges in Mongolia and are consistent with Mongolia\u2019s water policy directions. \n   \n9.  Conducting a CWSA for Mongolia is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, \nKnowledge  Management  Directions  and  Action  Plan,  and the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy \n2020.9 It is also in line with ADB\u2019s Mongolia interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132016, \nwhich  supports  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  society  by  promoting \nenvironmentally sustainable development, and in particular aims to help Mongolia adapt to \nimpacts of climate change by supporting the efficient use and sustainable management of \nnatural  resources.10 Furthermore,  outputs  from  the  CWSA  exercise  will  help  contribute  to \nMongolia\u2019s  National  Development  Strategy  of  2007,11 which  contains  specific  environment-\nrelated directions for 2007\u20132021, as well as the 2012 Government Action Program, which \nincludes a number of key priorities related to the natural resources sector.12 \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the TA will be increased water security through improved water \ngovernance  in  Mongolia.  The  expected  outcome  will  be  policy  recommendations  and \ninvestments for strengthening water security approved by the government.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will result in a program for development of sound water management systems \nand greater operational capacity for water management in Mongolia. The TA will produce the \nfollowing outputs: (i) CWSA completed, (ii) proposed program of investments and technical \nassistance prepared, and (iii) CWSA results and stakeholder consultations documented. \n \n12.  Output 1: Country water security assessment completed. Under this output, the TA \nwill produce a CWSA report that will cover (i) a water resources profile; (ii) international best \npractices and implications for Mongolia\u2019s water security management; (iii) a set of water security \ncase  studies  based  on  the  Asian  Water  Development  Outlook  approach,  including  (a) \nhousehold water security (e.g., herder communities), (b) economic water security (e.g., irrigation \nfor agriculture and energy use in South Gobi), (c) urban water security (e.g., Ulaanbaatar), (d) \nenvironmental water security (e.g., Altai Mountains), and (e) resilience to water-related disasters \n(e.g., drought preparedness); the case studies will present existing and potential future water \nsecurity dynamics and present recommendations and strategies for improving national water \nsecurity; and (iv) assessment of water security risks and water management options. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Output 2: Proposed program of investments and technical assistance prepared. \nUnder this output, a draft and final program of proposed investments and TA projects will be \nprepared in consultation with government stakeholders, including the Ministry of Environment \nand Green Development (MEGD), Ministry of Finance, and other related ministries and entities \nsuch as, but not limited to, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Industry and Agriculture, Tuul River \nBasin Authority, Water Supply and Sewerage Authority of Ulaanbaatar City, Water Resources \nGroup, Mongolian National Water Committee, and National Security Council. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Country  water  security  assessment  results  and  stakeholder \nconsultations documented. Under this output, two stakeholder consultation workshops will be \nheld to disseminate and solicit consensus on the results of the CWSA. The CWSA report will be \nsubmitted to MEGD and the National Security Council for endorsement.  \n \n15.  The TA assumes that the government at various levels is committed to the preparation \nand implementation of IWRM plans and that the government will adopt a risk based approach to \nwater management to ensure water security. The realization of the TA\u2019s expected impact may \nbe at risk if the government\u2019s investment is insufficient, and if capacity for water management is \ninadequate. This potential risk will be managed through ongoing dialogue with MEGD and \nongoing consultations with key stakeholders throughout TA preparation and implementation.   \n \n16.  MEGD\u2019s strong leadership, vision, and ownership, demonstrated throughout the ongoing \nrelationship of ADB and Mongolia, will mitigate the possible risks and ensure efficient and \neffective implementation of the TA. It is expected that MEGD and other concerned stakeholders \nwill continue to exhibit strong commitment and a sense of ownership, which will ensure their \nactive  participation  in  the  preparation  of  the  CWSA.  Extensive  consultations  and  planning \nmeetings with involved stakeholders, ranging from officials from MEGD, Ministry of Health, Tuul \nRiver  Basin  Authority,  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority  of  Ulaanbaatar  City,  Water \nResources Group, Mongolian National Water Committee, and National Security Council will \ncontinue to be held to further conceptualize the assistance and how best to add value, help the \ngovernment manage the risk of water scarcity and insecurity, and ensure that all sectors are \nfully aware of the new development approaches and opportunities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.   The TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  facilities,  administrative  and  logistical  support  for \nconsultants, including translation and transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MEGD will be the executing agency, while MEGD\u2019s Green Development Policy and \nPlanning Department will be the implementing agency of the TA. A steering committee chaired \nby MEGD will be established, which may include officials from the National Security Council, \nNational Water Committee, Ministry of Energy and Mining, Ministry of Economic Development, \nMinistry  of  Finance,13 Ministry  of  Industry  and  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of \nConstruction and Urban Development, Water Supply and Sewerage Authority of Ulaanbaatar \n                                                \n13 In the coming months, the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Finance will be merged, subject \nto parliamentary approval. \n ", "  5 \nCity, and others. MEGD will provide dedicated staff to act as focal points for the coordination of \nTA activities. A TA management office will be established in the Green Development Policy and \nPlanning Department with support of the International Cooperation Division of MEGD, to ensure \nday-to-day implementation and management of the TA.  \n \n19.  Procurement under the TA will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). A firm or entity, comprising a team of three \ninternational consultants (12 person-months) and six national consultants (35 person-months), \nwill be engaged to help implement the TA activities. The firm or entity will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime) using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, and \nby inviting simplified technical proposals. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance \nwith the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  15  March  2015  to  15  June  2016.  Under  the \nsupervision of ADB, the executing and implementing agencies and the firm will (i) lead TA \nimplementation, (ii) assemble and support the specialists, and (iii) utilize the firm\u2019s pool of \nnational and/or international expertise, as necessary, to achieve the TA outputs. The ADB team \nwill collaborate closely with MEGD during TA implementation to ensure proper monitoring and \nevaluation  of  results,  and  maintain  progress  on  plans  for  the  CSWA  exercise.  ADB  will \nundertake  intensive  review  and  supervision  by  fielding  missions  at  critical  stages  of  TA \nimplementation\u2014particularly inception, interim, and final missions; and by extending regular \nsupport  from  ADB  headquarters.  TA  progress  will  be  measured  against  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework, the consultants\u2019 terms of reference, and the TA progress reports. TA \nresults will be disseminated through the release of the project reports, TA workshops, and \nmedia releases. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.
