In line with the authority delegated to country directors or heads of divisions to approve \nsmall-scale  technical  assistance  (TA),  we  request  approval  of  the  subject  small-scale  TA \namounting to $225,000 to be financed on a grant basis by Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). This TA will become effective upon approval; such \napproval will be reported to the Board in the Quarterly Summary Report on Small-Scale and \nSupplementary Technical Assistance Projects not exceeding $225,000. \n \nB.  Rationale and Justification \n \n2.  Natural gas is the most important indigenous source of energy in Uzbekistan and is \nregarded as one of the key driving forces of the country\u2019s economy, contributing to 20% of national \nbudget revenues (taxes) and 15% of the national gross domestic product (GDP). Natural gas \ncomprises 85% of the country\u2019s energy mix, and 75% of electricity generated in the country.  \nUzbekistan's aging gas infrastructure and network underinvestment have led to supply shortages, \ninefficiency, high losses, and low reliability. Built more than 50 years ago, the gas transmission \nsystem consists of a complex network of high- and medium-pressure pipelines equipped with \nphysically degraded compressors and lacking any centralized functions to measure, monitor, and \ncontrol supply and demand.  \n \n3.  The absence of periodic maintenance and insufficient capital investments are currently \nresulting  in  technical  losses  of  15%  equivalent  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  gas  export  volumes.  Most \ntransmission facilities have not been tested or inspected for the past 30 years. Without adequate \ncapital investment in transmission modernization, automation and management of a system of \nthis size, gas transportation remains highly underutilized leading to higher maintenance cost, \ngreater operational risks and economic and financial losses. This imperils Uzbekistan\u2019s energy \nsecurity and constrains national economic growth. \n \n4.  To  sustainably  manage  and  efficiently  utilize  its  gas  potential,  the  Government  of \nUzbekistan is aiming at modernizing its gas infrastructure with support from ADB. A project \nconcept paper for an ensuing loan was approved on 28 January 2019 (UZB: Regional Gas \nTransmission Efficiency and Enhancement Project). \n \n5.  The project scope originally comprised: (i) the modernization of two compressor stations \n(at Yangier and Khodjaabad), (ii) the construction of a 95-kilometer pipeline linking Yangier and \nAkhangaran, and (iii) in-line inspection of the Soh-Namangan-Andijan pipeline. In December 2019, \nthe Government of Uzbekistan requested ADB to include two additional components, namely: (i) \nthe  installation  of  a  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system (SCADA),  and  (ii) the \nexpansion of the underground gas storage at Khodjaabad.1 ADB agreed to incorporate these two \ncrucial components to the existing project scope. \n \n6.  This small-scale TA will support the preparation of SCADA system implementation for \nUzbekistan\u2019s gas sector. SCADA is a standard operational practice in gas transportation systems \nand allows real-time assessment of the status of gas transportation infrastructure, including \nnatural gas flow rates, operational pressure, and other technical indicators at any given time and \nlocation of the network. Access to these data is critical to quickly respond to any disruptive \n \n1  The indicative DMF of the ensuing project will be revised to reflect the additional components. \n ", "2 \nchanges in the condition of the gas transportation system, optimize network operation and \nmaximize returns from gas transportation assets through effective system monitoring and control.  \n \n7.  At present, Uzbekistan\u2019s gas sector does not have a SCADA system and operates on \nanalogue equipment. Introducing a modern SCADA system will digitalize network operation and \nallow  for  a  modern  communication  infrastructure  to  deliver  relevant  real-time  data  and \ntransparency on network operating conditions. The addition of SCADA to the project scope is fully \ncompatible and complementary with the planned gas infrastructure modernization project. It is \nexpected to add significant value to the project and capitalize on the modernization effort by \nimproving overall efficiency, profitability and reliability of national gas supply. Any existing SCADA \nstudies in relation to Uzbekistan\u2019s gas sector shall be used to the extent possible. \n \n8.  On 22 January 2019 ADB approved transaction TA facility to prepare several investment \nprojects in electricity and gas subsectors including Regional Gas Transmission Efficiency and \nEnhancement Project.2 Funds under the TA facility have already been allocated for the planned \nprojects. The scope of TA facility did not include preparation of SCADA system since the request \nfor additional scope was submitted to ADB only in December 2019. The proposed small-scale TA \nwill enable fast preparation of SCADA component and its integration to Regional Gas Transmission \nEfficiency and Enhancement Project, for which preparatory works are already at an advanced stage. \nThe small-scale TA modality is an ideal fit considering relatively small size of SCADA component \nand the project processing time schedule. The TA at a glance is in Attachment 1. \n \nC.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.
