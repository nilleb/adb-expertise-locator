During the 2003 country programming mission of the Asian Develoment Bank (ADB), the \nGovernment of Indonesia requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare a water resources \nmanagement project, aimed at improving deteriorated irrigation and water supply facilities in the \nCitarum River basin through an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach. The \nTA Fact-Finding Mission visited Indonesia from 1 to 9 June 2004 to develop the scope of work \nand implementation arrangements with the Government. After discussions with the Government \nofficials, the title of the proposed Project was changed to Integrated Citarum Water Resources \nManagement Project. The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1, and an initial poverty \nand social analysis is in Appendix 2. The TA is included in ADB's 2004 country  assistance \nprogram for Indonesia.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   The Citarum River basin measures over 11,000  square kilometers and the Citarum \nRiver is about 270 kilometers in length. More than 9 million people, including the population in \nthe provincial capital of the west Java, Bandung City, live in the basin. Three large, multipurpose \nreservoirs from upstream to downstream (Saguling, Cirata, and Jatiluhur) in the basin regulate \nthe water flow and are the main source of water supply in Jakarta City, through the West Tarum \nCanal. The canal was constructed in the early 1970s, is 70 kilometers long, and can conduct 27 \ncubic meters (m3) per second of water. Jatiluhur irrigation system covers 240,000 hectares \ndownstream of the Citarum River. The Citarum River can carry about 12.95 billion m3 annually, \nconsisting of 6 billion m3 from the Citarum River and 6.95 billion m3 from its tributaries. Currently, \nmore than 85% of the river water is used for irrigation and the rest is used for domestic and \nindustry water supply. Due to rapid development in the basin and Jakarta City, water shortage is \nexpected in the near future.  \n \n3.  Poor Operation and Maintenance. Perusahaan Umum Jasa Tirta II  (PJT II), a state-\nowned corporation, was established by Government Regulation 94/1999, and is responsible for \n(i) conducting self-funding operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Jatiluhur water resources \nsystems (including irrigation, raw water supply, and hydro power systems); (ii) providing water \nresources services; (iii) collecting from the water users funds for O&M of the Jatiluhur water \nsystems; and (iv) managing the Citarum River basin (conservation, utilization, and flood control \nmitigation). The management function of PJT II is limited to acting as an operator of the system \nwithout having a regulatory function.  \n \n4.  Currently, the water users pay to PJT II only a part of the required O&M cost, because of \nlow water tariff.  According to the Government regulation, PJT II is responsible for the main \ncanal system, while the provincial government is responsible for the secondary canal systems. \nHowever, PJT II is taking the responsibility for O&M of the secondary canals  because the \npredecessor (Jatiluhur Authority) of PJT II had O&M responsibilities since 1970s, which is an \nadditional financial burden on PJT II. Due to the shortage of O&M funds, PJT II cannot operate \nand maintain the facilities properly. The West Tarum Canal supplies 80% of water required in \nJakarta and its surrounding cities from the Jatiluhur Reservoir, but the canal\u2019s condition has \ndeteriorated rapidly. In 2002, water supply through the West Tarum Canal was completely \nsuspended for 10 days  because  part  of  its  foundation  collapsed  near  Jakarta  City. The \nrestoration work was carried out by the special working team organized and financed by the \ncentral Government. The current capacity of the canal is insufficient to deliver the water that will \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 21 June 2004.  ", "2    \nbe needed in the area by 2010, and, unless additional water supply is ensured, the domestic \nwater supply will be critically short in Bekasi, Bogor, Jakarta, and Tangerang cities. \n \n5.  The cropping intensity mainly for rice in the lower reaches of the Jatiluhur  irrigation \nsystem has decreased by 25% in recent years due to the shortage of irrigation water caused by \nthe degradation of the main and the secondary canals. Irrigation facilities covering the service \narea of about 145,000 hectares must be rehabilitated. Overall, the water delivery from the \nJatiluhur system is inefficient due to (i) seepage from the canals,2 (ii) evaporation loss, and (iii) \ndelivery loss. The major reason for the canal\u2019s degradation is inadequate O&M resulting from \nshortage of funds.    \n \n6.  Lack  of  Coordination  Mechanisms.  The  West  Java  Provincial  Water  Resources \nManagement (PSDA) Unit is responsible for (i) formulation of provincial policies and local \ngovernment  regulations  related  to  water  resources;  (ii)  technical  recommendations  to  the \ngovernor regarding any water resources use permits; (iii) implementation of water resources \nmanagement actions funded by the West Java provincial government; and (iv) comanagement \nwith Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR)  of construction and  maintenance of \nirrigation, flood control, and raw water supply infrastructures. Citarum Balai PSDA under the \nprovincial  government  is  responsible  for  (i)  implementing  a  regulatory  function  within  the \nCitarum River basin by the order of the West Java PSDA, and (ii) implementing water resources \nmanagement and O&M works for the rivers and water resources infrastructures for the Citarum \nRiver tributaries.   \n \n7.  A new water resources law (7/2004) was approved by the Parliament and enforced in \nearly  2004.  As  stipulated  in  the  new  law,  establishment  of  national  and  provincial  water \nresources councils is mandatory, but the establishment of district/city and river basin councils is \nbased  on  local  conditions.  Provincial  water  resources  councils  are  responsible  for  (i) \ncoordination and policy formulation for provincial water resources issues, (ii) monitoring and \nevaluation of implementation of policy at the provincial level, (iii) provision of recommendations \non  policy  and  any  other  measures  and  actions  related  to  the  governor,  and  (iv)  conflict \nresolution and mediation on provincial water resources issues or issues brought up by the local \ngovernment. However, water resources councils are not functioning yet, since the implementing \nrules and regulations for the new water resources law (7/2004) are still being prepared. \n \n8.  Environmental Degradation. The environment upstream of the Citarum  River basin \nhas severe problems related to soil erosion, heavy sedimentation, poor water quality and heavy \npollution loads, improper disposal of garbage and other solid waste, water shortage in the dry \nseason, flooding in the rainy season, over extraction of groundwater, land subsidence, effluent \nfrom factories, and improper land use.    \n \n9.  The pollution of surface water upstream  of the Saguling  Reservoir3 has reached an \nalarming level. The concentrations of organic pollutant, pathogenic bacteria, dissolved oxygen, \nammonia, and some heavy metals exceed the water quality standards, especially in the dry \nseason. The Saguling Reservoir has a natural self-purification capacity, but many signs (e.g., \ndead fish floating on the water surface) indicate the  reservoir\u2019s self-purification capacity  has \nbeen exceeded.  \n \n                                                 \n2  Most parts of the canal are unlined.  \n3  The Saguling Reservoir is one of three large reservoirs in the Citarum River, and is downstream of Bandung City.  ", "  3\n10.  There are no proper mechanisms to restrict land use and to control the development \nactivities in watershed area. According to the new water resources law (7/2004), water-related \nmatters in  the watershed area are under the jurisdiction of DGWR. However, coordination \nmechanisms between local governments and DGWR are still weak. DGWR does not have the \nauthority to restrict development to maintain the watershed area adequately as a water source.  \n \n11.  Lessons Learned. A substantial amount of money has been invested in infrastructure \ndevelopment in the Citarum River basin without consultation with civil society, water users, and \npeople living in upper watershed areas. Heavy reliance on infrastructure development has led to \ncostly solutions. Cheaper and more sustainable solutions could  have  been  found through \npromoting  upstream-downstream  cooperation  in  integrated  river  basin  management; \nstrengthening local governance capacity for land-use planning and management; and helping \npeople,  industry,  and  commerce  to  make  better  informed  decisions  about  location  and \narrangement of their homes and businesses so they are less vulnerable to the effects of flood, \nlandslides, and timber felling.    \n \n12.  Projects attempting to  tackle several issues with many executing agencies through a \nnumber  of  components  have  often  been  unsuccessful.  Lack  of  coordination  among  the \nexecuting  agencies  hampers  implementation.  A  comprehensive  solution  requires  the \ninvolvement of many government agencies and staff to tackle complicated rules and regulations. \nThus, a project is more likely to be successful if it is sharply focused to resolve issues and has \nfew executing agencies so they can develop a strong sense of \u201cownership\u201d.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  prepare  the  Integrated  Citarum  Water  Resources \nManagement  Project.  The  proposed  Project  will  promote  integrated  water  resources  and \nenvironmental management within the Citarum River basin, addressing water conservation and \nuse, mitigation of impacts, and covering watershed management, agriculture, water supply, and \nenergy, for the benefit of all water users in the river basin. \n \n14.  The TA will assist the Government to (i) update the IWRM plan for the Citarum River \nbasin; (ii) strengthen the institutional capacity for IWRM; (iii) review the Government policy on \nraw water tariff and on O&M of water supply system by PJT II, and recommend the appropriate \nlevel of raw water tariff with future responsibility of PJT II; (iv) prepare a regulatory framework on \nIWRM, including roles and responsibilities of stakeholders; and (v) formulate an IWRM project \nfor the Citarum River basin, for possible funding by ADB. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.   The TA will comprise studies to (i) provide an overview of the Government's water \nresources  management  strategies,  priorities,  and  investment  plans;  (ii)  assess  the \ncompleteness and adequacy of the existing water resources management plan for the basin, \nbased on technical, institutional, environmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant \nfactors;  (iii)  formulate  recommendations,  as  appropriate,  for  adjusting  the  plan,  and  for \ninstitutional  strengthening,  improvement  of  coordination,  legislative  reforms,  financing,  cost \nrecovery, and justification of proposed works; (iv) assess institutional reform needs  for river \nbasin management as required under the water resources law (7/2004); and (v) assess the \nsteps required to implement IWRM principles and processes, such as conjunctive use of surface ", "4    \nand groundwater, and water use and polluters pay principles. The outcome of the study will be a \ntool for policy dialogue during processing of the loan for the Project. \n \n16.  Considering the environmental  degradation in the basin, the study will also examine \nmeasures to integrate sound environmental management and increased social awareness into \nthe planning, design, and implementation of water resources management, and coordination of \nactivities between upstream and downstream societies, including resources transfer among \nstakeholders. The role of civil society in IWRM will also be reviewed and identified. \n \n17.  In the first phase of  4 months, the consultants will work closely with the National \nPlanning Agency (BAPPENAS) and the relevant agencies  concerned to update the current \nCitarum Water Resource Management Plan, determine appropriate institutional setting for the \nplan and review and assess lessons from similar past and on-going projects financed by ADB \nand other external  agencies. The consultant team will identify a prioritized list of investment \nsubprojects for the basin. After the stakeholder analysis in the basin, the beneficiaries will be \nconsulted via meetings with local government officials to discuss the investment plan.  \n \n18.  Subject to a satisfactory conclusion of the first phase, further studies will be under taken \nfor  the  priority  subprojects,  with  detailed  scope  of  work,  cost  estimates,  implementation \narrangements, initial environmental assessments, and resettlement plans, if necessary. A 1-day \nstakeholder workshop to discuss the draft final report will be held right after the submission of \nthe draft final report. The consultants will also prepare the documents  for clearance by the \nIndonesian Government in accordance with Ministerial Decree 35/2003. The consultants  will \nanalyze the local  governments and PJT II\u2019s abilities to be able to afford to implement the \nproposed Project.4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total TA cost is estimated at $1.26 million equivalent of which $543,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $717,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1.00 million equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $457,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will provide the remaining local currency cost of $260,000 \nequivalent  through  the  provision  of  experienced  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  data, \nadministrative and clerical services, and communications. Detailed cost estimates are provided \nin Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented in two phases over a period of 12 months. The consultants \nwill commence field work in January 2005 and complete  their work in December 2005.  The \nExecuting Agency for the TA at the national level will be DGWR. Although the ensuing Project \nwill be nationally coordinated, it will be implemented at decentralized levels of administration, \nwith most of the planning, implementation, and capacity-building efforts taking place at the local \nlevel in accordance with Indonesia's policy on regional administration (Republic Law 22/1999). \nClose  coordination  and  effective  linkages  will  need  to  be  established  between  national, \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

A TA  coordination committee will be established to facilitate  interagency coordination \nand review the progress and outputs of the TA. The committee will be chaired by a senior officer \nwithin BAPPENAS, and  will comprise senior representatives from DGWR; the ministries of \nagriculture, environment, finance, forestry, and home affairs; West Java provincial government; \nPJT II; and  the Perusahaan Listrik Negara.5  \n \n22.  A total of 78 person-months of consulting services (20 person-months of international \nconsultants  and  58  person-months  of  domestic  consultants)  will  be engaged through an \ninternational consulting firm, which will also have domestic consultants associated with it. The \nteam leader, an international consultant, will work full-time in Indonesia for the duration of the \nTA  study.  Expertise  will  be  required  in  water  resources  planning,  integrated  river  basin \nmanagement, hydrology, hydraulic structure engineering and irrigation, sociology, rural income \ngeneration,  agriculture,  land  and  forest  management  and  spatial  planning,  community \nparticipation and institutional strengthening, environment, and economy.  The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 4. The consultants will be engaged in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Simplified technical proposals \nwill be evaluated using the quality- and cost-based selection method for the consulting firm. \nEquipment will be procured in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB, and retained \nby DGWR upon TA completion.  \n \n23.  The final report will cover the project rationale; objectives; scope; detailed cost estimate; \norganization,  implementation,  and  management  arrangements;  socioeconomic  and \nenvironmental aspects; policy recommendations; and a proposal for impact monitoring and \nevaluation. The main report will follow the format of ADB's report and recommendation of the \nPresident,6 and will include detailed appendixes covering the consultants\u2019 work and analyses. \nThe appendixes will include the project framework, sector and subsector analysis, summary of \nexternal assistance, cost estimates and financing plan, implementation schedule, proposed \nproject  organization  chart,  financial  and  economic  analysis,  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy,  indigenous  people's  development  plan,  initial  environmental  examination,  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation framework, outline terms of reference for consultant services, and \nlessons learned from previous water resources  development projects in Indonesia and from \nADB-financed projects in other countries. The report will include  a map of the project area \nshowing the location of proposed project sites. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia  for  preparing  the  Integrated  Citarum  Water  Resources \nManagement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n5  State electricity enterprise that owns two reservoirs (Cirata and Sagulin) in the Citarum River.  \n6  Prepared in accordance with Appendix 8 of ADB. 2002.

In accordance with ADB's environmental policy, the consultants will prepare  an initial \nenvironmental examination and/or environmental impact assessment, if warranted,  following \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The environmental assessments should \nidentify  all  positive  and  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts.  The  consultants  will \nrecommend measures (including changes in the design) to eliminate, offset, or reduce adverse \nimpacts to an acceptable limit. Wherever feasible, the consultants will identify complementary \nworks to enhance the positive environmental impacts of proposed works. Costs and benefits of \nall such measures and complementary works will be estimated.  \n \n15.  A  draft  environmental  management  plan  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject,  to \ndescribe the procedures for environmental management and monitoring, including institutional \narrangements; tasks and implementation schedules; estimated costs; reporting arrangements \nand schedules; and any special measures, such as training and public involvement activities. \nThe plans will be finalized during the detailed design phase. \n \n16.  The consultants will analyze local governments\u2019 capability to fund their contribution to \nthe proposed  Project, and their  sources of funds. The analyses should follow the rules and \nregulations  of  the  government  financing  policy  for  local  governments  (Ministerial  Decree \n35/2003).  The  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects Financed by ADB should be used for the analysis. \n \n17.  The consultants will analyze the economic benefits and costs and will calculate the \neconomic internal rate of return, perform sensitivity and risk analyses, and calculate switching \nvalues for each subproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Economic Analysis of \nProjects  and  Economic  Analysis  of  Environmental  Impacts  of  Development  Projects.  The \nCOSTAB software program should be used to estimate the project cost. The consultants will \nalso examine the distribution of project costs and benefits, in financial and economic terms, \nallocated to the various stakeholders, and estimate the distribution of project effects on the poor \nto determine their poverty impact, as outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact \nAssessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n \n2.  Formulation of the Project \n18.  The consultants will  formulate a water resources management project in the  Citarum \nRiver basin.
