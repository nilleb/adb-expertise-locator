INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in \nconducting the midterm review of the 13th Five-Year Plan (13th plan) and the preparation of the \n14th Five-Year Plan (14th plan).1 This is a continuation of the support that the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) provided to the 12th and 13th plans. The TA is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2018\u20132020 for the PRC.2 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the NDRC agreed on (i) the objective of the \nstudy, which is to help the PRC achieve higher quality growth to address the people's ever-\ngrowing needs for a better life; (ii) the key areas to be covered\u2014people-centered urbanization, \ndemographic transition, and ecological civilization; and (iii) the major milestones\u2014submission of \nthe draft midterm review in June 2018 and provision of strategic recommendations for the 14th \nplan in June 2019.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The economic performance of the PRC since 1978 has been impressive. Gross domestic \nproduct growth has averaged about 9.6% per year and per capita income has increased by a \nfactor of 8.5. Rapid economic growth has led to significant improvements in human well-being \nand quality of life. During 1978\u20132016, the PRC\u2019s rural poverty headcount ratio declined from \n97.5% to 4.5%,3 life expectancy at birth increased from 67 to 73 years, and child mortality declined \nfrom 65 deaths per 1,000 live births to 18 per 1,000. \n \n4.  Historically, the PRC has been very successful in achieving its income-based policy \ntargets. However, robust economic growth has come at a cost, notably environmental degradation \nand pollution, uneven distribution of development benefits leading to inequality, and a variety of \nsocial challenges associated with regional and rural\u2013urban disparities and an aging population. \nAccordingly, since 2002, the PRC has been progressively shifting from a singular focus on \neconomic  growth  to  a  broader  concept  of  quality  development,  encompassing  social \ninclusiveness (\u201charmonious society\u201d) and environmental sustainability (\u201cecological civilization\u201d). \nThe government reinforced this trend in the policies of the 13th plan and more recently in the \nreport of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nwhich emphasized a new strategic goal to foster the \u201cwell-being\u201d (mei hao sheng huo) of the \npeople. This will be a top priority for the government in the coming years. \n \n5.  The PRC has a long tradition of formulating five-year plans to address the country\u2019s \ndevelopment challenges and promote social and economic development. The plans lay out the \nstrategic  objectives  of the  country,  establish the  government\u2019s  work  priorities,  and  provide \nguidance for market activities. Since the founding of the PRC, the government has formulated 13 \nfive-year plans, each of which has had a significant impact on the country\u2019s development. ADB \nprovided  strategic  advice  through  TA  projects  for  both  the  12th  and  13th  plans.  The \nimplementation of the 13th plan is ongoing and close to midterm. The government plans to start \nthe midterm review of the 13th plan in June 2018. Then, drawing on the review\u2019s findings and \nconclusions, it intends to start preparing the 14th plan, which will cover 2021\u20132025. This will be a \ncritical period for the PRC as it aims to move beyond the current goal of a \u201cmoderately prosperous\u201d \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 April 2018. \n2 ADB. 2018.

ADB recognizes this member as the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n ", "2 \nsociety  and  transition  toward  a  high-income  economy  and  a  modern  society  focused  on \ndeveloping the broader well-being of the population. \n \n6.  The NDRC and ADB jointly identified and selected three substudies for the TA that are \nhighly relevant to the broader well-being of the population. \n(i)  People-centered and environmentally sustainable urbanization. The substudy \nwill focus on issues in these areas: (a) low-carbon and climate-resilient urban \ndevelopment;  (b)  city-cluster  and  urban\u2013rural  development  cooperation  and \npartnerships; and (c) social inclusion, covering issues of the social protection \ndesign and accessibility to social protection benefits and basic public services, \nmaking cities healthier, and the migrant-related aspects of these challenges. \n(ii)  Demographic transition. The substudy will cover the following issues: (a) trends \nand characteristics of demographic transition; (b) family planning policies and \nservices, including the two-child policy, reproductive health for mothers, and others \nthat respond to the needs of families following the policies; (c) health and education \nservices for infants and young children; (d) and other salient demographic issues \nincluding  the  skewed  birth  ratio,  regional  and  urban\u2013rural  distributions  of \npopulation, and migration. \n(iii)  Ecological civilization. The substudy will build on past and ongoing ADB work, \nand  international  best  practices  to  recommend  necessary  policy  reforms  for \nenvironmental protection (air, water, and soil pollution control), ecosystem and \nnatural resources management, and environmental regulation and administration. \n \n7.   Each of the substudies will consider three dimensions of the policy challenge in their \nrespective areas\u2014governance and institutional reforms, financial mechanisms and resources, \nand economic instruments and incentives. \n \n8.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. During the first phase, the project team will \nconduct a midterm review of the 13th plan in several key areas. Through this review, the team \nwill assess progress against the objectives of the 13th plan on the effectiveness of the policy \nchanges and the institutional and/or legal reforms implemented, and the remaining challenges to \nachieving the 13th plan\u2019s goals, including those posed by domestic and global socioeconomic \ntrends. \n \n9.  The second phase of the TA will build on the findings and conclusions of the midterm \nreview and carry out research in the three selected areas to provide inputs for the preparation of \nthe 14th plan. The project team will draw on international experience in formulating its analysis \nand recommendations. The proposed reforms will be sequenced and linked to a central theme of \ntransitioning to higher quality development in the pursuit of national well-being. To this end, as \npart of the second phase, the team will develop an overarching central theme for the study that \nwill be discussed and agreed upon once the government\u2019s priorities for the 14th plan are more \nfirmly established. The project team will prepare an overview report that will summarize the \nfindings, conclusions, and policy recommendations under the overarching central theme. \n \n10.  To facilitate the transition from the midterm review of the 13th plan to the initial research \nfor the 14th plan, and to better define the overarching central theme for the study, the government \nand ADB agree to convene a high-level academic conference in the second half of 2018. The \nconference will involve senior PRC government officials, eminent international experts, and \ncelebrated national specialists. These participants will (i) comment on the midterm review of the \n13th Plan, (ii) discuss the latest thinking on new models of progress and how the PRC may apply \nthese to its long term-strategy, and (iii) some of the international and national experts will be \n   ", "3 \ncommissioned to write a series of papers for the conference that could provide the intellectual \nunderpinnings for the study for the 14th plan.4 The conference would aim to draw experts from \nthe PRC, ADB, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, \nthe United States, and others. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: progress towards well-being (mei hao sheng \nhuo) goal improved.5 The TA will contribute to the following outcome: policy and regulatory \nenvironment to support balanced and sustainable development improved.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n12.  Output 1: One main report and three subreports for each phase prepared.  The TA \nproject team will provide two sets of reports. The first set will be the 13th plan midterm review \nreport on the three selected areas. ADB will submit the draft midterm review report to the NDRC \nin June 2018 and its final version in September 2018. The second set of reports will consist of a \ncomprehensive overview report and three subreports with policy recommendations for the 14th \nplan on the selected areas. ADB will submit the draft report to the NDRC in June 2019 and the \nfinal report in October 2019. The second phase of the TA will seek to build on the outcome of the \nreview workshops of the first phase and the high-level conference to prepare the final study \ncontaining the recommendations for the 14th plan. This is likely to require further research and \nengagement with domestic academic institutions.  \n \n13.  Output  2:  Awareness  of  balanced  and  sustainable  development  among \nstakeholders enhanced. The TA will start with a series of workshops that will provide inputs into \ntwo products: (i) an interim set of reports that will provide inputs into the midterm review of the \n13th plan (June 2018); and (ii) a high-level academic conference on the central theme of the \nPRC\u2019s transition to a focus on well-being and higher quality of development (August 2018).  At \nleast 150 participants (of which at least 30% are women) will attend the above-mentioned \nworkshops  and  conference  with  increased  understanding  on  balanced  and  sustainable \ndevelopment including gender equality. The final versions of the two sets of reports will be printed \nfor distribution in the conferences and dissemination activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The value of government \ncontribution is estimated to account for 14% of the total TA cost. \n                                                \n4 This model was used in the 2010 Cairncross Foundation study \u201cMedium and Long-Term Development and \nTransformation of the Chinese Economy\u201d headed by Edwin Lim and Michael Spence. \n5 Communist Party of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2017.
