The  country  strategy  and  program1 (CSP)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nincludes  Capacity  Building  in  Water  Resources  in  a  Decentralized  Environment  technical \nassistance (TA).2 In March 2005, the Government of Indonesia (the Government) requested \nADB to provide specific support for capacity building in the water resources sector to target \n(i) strengthening  the  capacity  for  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM); \n(ii) implementation of the new Water Law No. 7, 2004; (iii) follow-up on recommendations from \nthe Capacity Building Project in the Water Resources Sector (CBWRS);3 and (iv) building the \ncapacity of local government and local stakeholders under the recent policy of decentralization.   \n \n2.  From 6 to 9 November 2007, ADB jointly hosted water financing program conference \nwith the National Planning Development Agency (BAPPENAS) and Ministry of Public Works to \nboost  water  investments.  The  conference  conclusions  emphasized  the  importance  of \nsignificantly increasing water sector infrastructure investment in Indonesia. The Government \nagain requested increased ADB financing and a higher level of TA support to capacity building \ndevelopment programs. \n \n3.  In November 2007, at the invitation of the Government, an ADB fact-finding mission \nvisited Indonesia for consultations with the key water resources line agencies and sectoral \nstakeholders.  Based  on  these  consultations,  the  TA  was  formulated.4 The  Government \nconfirmed its concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \nand  costs  and  financing  arrangements  of  the  proposed  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Indonesia has abundant rainfall, resulting in some 3,100 billion cubic meters (m3) annual \nrunoff or about 14,000 m3/person. However, countrywide averages misrepresent the severe \nwater  stresses  found  in  Java,  which  is  home  to  120  million  people  (60%  of  Indonesia\u2019s \npopulation, 83% of the industrial turnover, and 60% of rice production), where water availability \nis only 1,400 m3/person and under 500 m3/person in a number of key river basins. Java\u2019s urban \npopulation will grow by 35 million\u201340 million by 2020, putting further stress on the environment \nand water services. In 2004, the United Nations reported that national access to safe water was \nestimated at 74% (urban 89%, rural 64%) and sanitation access 59% (urban 74%, rural 52%). \nHowever, Indonesia is unlikely to meet Millennium Development Goal targets, and is falling \nbehind Southeast Asian water services delivery norms. \n \n5.  The Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) in the Ministry of Public Works is \nresponsible for overall sector policy guidance, and provides national level management and \nimplementation functions in the water resources sector. Independent water resources agencies \n(WRAs) provide services within the 40 provincial governments; a further 350 district level WRAs \nexist  within  decentralized  local  government  administrations.  In  addition,  133  hydrologically \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009): Republic of Indonesia. Manila. The CSP details a series \nof capacity building activities, including a larger water resources \u201ccluster\u201d technical assistance commencing in \n2009. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 27 November 2006. \n3  ADB. 1994. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic  of Indonesia for the Capacity Building Project in the Water Resources Sector. Manila. \n4  The proposed TA focuses on capacity development for basin water and irrigation services as part of ADB\u2019s water \nfinancing program.  \n ", "2   \ndefined river basin organizations (RBOs) provide development and asset management services \nfor  in-stream  water  resources  management  in  river  basin  territories.  Subsector  legislation5 \n(covering irrigation, rivers, swamps, coastal management, reservoirs, etc.) following Water Law \nNo.  7  defines  the  roles  of  these  organizations.  This  legislation  takes  into  account  recent \ndecentralization  policies  which  define,  in  global  terms,  the  roles  of  the  different  levels  of \ngovernment and their fiscal responsibilities. To date, institutional assessments and diagnostics \nanalysis of WRAs have not been undertaken in a systematic, rigorous, and comprehensive way \nto determine the effect of decentralization and water sector reforms on WRA capacity to deliver \non their current responsibilities as mandated by law.  \n \n6.  When analyzing current capacity development issues in the Indonesian water sector, it is \nimportant to consider these recent legislative changes. Administrative decentralization reform \n(Regional Autonomy Act No. 22, 1999, updated by Law No. 33, 2005); fiscal decentralization \n(Regional Fiscal Autonomy Act No. 25, 1999, updated by Law No. 34, 2005);6 and water sector \nreforms (Water Law No. 7, 2004) are mutually reinforcing both in concept and timing. They \nprovide  an  excellent  opportunity  for  improved  water  resources  management  in  the  new \ndecentralized environment. The water resources sector is gradually evolving from a highly \ncentralized infrastructure development focus to a partially decentralized service delivery model. \nInstitutional reform is ongoing. While the current labyrinth of WRA organizations remains is in its \ninfancy, efforts by central and provincial governments to provide guidance and clarity have \nintensified since the issuance of the recent Water Law. Current efforts\u2014focusing on role sharing \nbetween  different  levels  of  government  agencies,  developing  interagency  cooperation  and \ncoordination, defining the roles of civil society organizations (CSOs), and elucidation of sector \nvis-\u00e0-vis  geographic  water  resources  management  models\u2014provide  a  timely  window  of \nopportunity to support the Government in its capacity development efforts.  \n \n7.  Indonesia\u2019s  national  water  resources  policy  takes  a  holistic  IWRM  approach  to \nsustainable water resources management. The Medium Term Development Plan, 2004\u20132009, \naims to address capacity constraints in the water resources sector, with a focus on capacity \nbuilding. The water resources sector has been a major area of ADB assistance to Indonesia, \ntotaling over $1.5 billion in loans and TA grants.7 Two key lessons from the ADB-funded CBWRS \nare that (i) the success of capacity building activities is highly dependent on strong commitment \nfrom the target individuals, managers and the involved institutions, the design stage of capacity \nbuilding programs therefore need to allow sufficient time for adequate stakeholder participation; \nand  (ii) capacity  building  programs  are  long-term  commitments.  ADB  has  recently  gained \nvaluable experience in addressing decentralization and providing capacity support to regional \ngovernments  in  Indonesia  through  the  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralization \nProject (SCBDP).8 This project was designed to develop institutional capacity to (i) deliver \nefficient public services in accordance with minimum service standards, (ii) maintain essential \npublicly managed facilities, and (iii) promote equitable economic development. Lessons from the \nSCBDP will be applied to diagnostic assessments of WRAs operating in the decentralized \nenvironment. \n                                                 \n5  While some of this legislation has been passed, a number of regulations remain in draft form. \n6  Indonesian decentralization is one of the largest undertaken in recent times. It is now widely acknowledged that the \nspeed, magnitude, and complexities of the decentralization were not commensurate with regional government \ncapacities and that the provision of essential services has been negatively effected and governance reduced. \n7  Of 48 agriculture and natural resources projects approved since 1990, 34 were for agriculture (including fisheries) \nand  14  were  oriented  toward  natural  resources  management.  Project  completion  reports  are  available  for \n17 projects, of which over 90% were rated either \u201csuccessful\u201d or \u201cpartly successful\u201d.  \n8  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic  of Indonesia for the Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization. Manila.   ", "  3\n \n8.  In 2007, ADB provided TA to DGWR for pilot testing a diagnostic analysis approach \nwithin Citarum River Basin Organization (Appendix 2). Outputs confirmed the need to (i) clarify \nthe  mandate  and  specific  responsibilities  of  the  organization,  including  role-sharing \narrangements  with  other  WRAs;  (ii)  strengthen  management  and  leadership  skills; \n(iii) strengthen  staff  capacities  in  nonengineering  disciplines;  (iv)  develop  networking  with \nregional WRAs and CSOs; and (v) provide more budget for routine operations. An overriding \nlesson was that while many officials (regional planners and policy makers, local WRA managers, \nand central Government) talk of capacity building, a basic understanding of the real capacity \ngaps is missing and capacity strengthening plans have not been adequately prepared. Further \nuse of the diagnostic process on a wider group of RBOs and regional WRAs will provide central \noversight agencies with a better overall picture of nationwide water sector capacity constraints \nin the decentralized environment.  \n \n9.  The CBWRS was intended to be the first of a series of interventions to address the \ncapacity  concerns  of  the  water  resources  sector  and initiate  a long-term  capacity  building \nprocess (footnote 3). The capacity building road is long, and the CBWRS was the first broad \nattempt to assist the Government to build effective multi-stakeholder water resources capacity \nat various levels of government. The TA will highlight post-Water Law capacity gaps in a \nnumber  of  RBOs  and  WRAs  to  provide  a  better  understanding  of  current  sector  capacity \nconstraints. Based on this understanding, it will prepare preliminary designs for a longer-term \ncapacity  development  strategy  and  support  program  to  continue  the  long-term  partnership \nbetween ADB and the Government in the water sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be to contribute to the environmental sustainability of natural \nresources in Indonesia. The primary outcome of the TA will be improved governance and water \nresources management among decentralized water resources stakeholders (Appendix 1).   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will build on previous and ongoing ADB/government capacity building initiatives \nand support, and it will complement ongoing and proposed ADB loans in the water resources \nsector.9 It will support BAPPENAS and DGWR in the development of national capacity building \nprocesses for the water sector by facilitating these organizations to lead: (i) phase 1, pilot \ntesting  of  participatory  capacity  development  action  plans  (CDAPs);  and  (ii)  phase  2, \ndevelopment of a countrywide capacity building strategy. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9 The lending pipeline of projects includes the Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management Investment \nProgram and Flood Management in Selected River Basins Project. The ongoing Participatory Irrigation Sector \nProject (ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Participatory Irrigation Sector Project. Manila.) supports a participatory \napproach  to  management  of  irrigation  and  water  resources  in  a  decentralized  administrative  and  fiscal \nenvironment. The Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project (ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Grant to the Republic  of Indonesia for the Earthquake \nand  Tsunami  Emergency  Support  Project.  Manila.)  irrigation  component  supports  rehabilitation  of  irrigation \nschemes over a total service area of about 70,000 hectares. \n ", "4   \n(1)  Phase 1: Pilot Testing of Capacity Development Action Plans \n   \n12.  The TA will review experience gained from recent capacity development initiatives with \nCSOs,  WRAs,  and  regional  governments.  Building  on  these  experiences,  it  will  pilot  test \ncapacity development performance assessments and diagnostic analysis techniques in five \nRBOs; eight provincial WRAs, and sixteen district WRAs.10 The output of phase 1 will be \nCDAPs for the selected regional water resource organizations. \n  \n13.  In phase 1, the TA will develop the capacity of the selected regional WRAs to prepare \nCDAPs. Capacity building support to water sector stakeholders will include (i) the provision of \ntechnical support and targeted training to WRAs and CSOs; (ii) studies and working group \nproblem analysis, and the development of capacity development process skills; (iii) expanding \npublic  awareness  in  IWRM;  (iv)  increasing  private  and  civil  society  involvement  in  IWRM; \n(v) undertaking peer reviews of CDAPs across WRAs; and (vi) preparing guidelines for the \nproduction of further CDAPs, based on experience gained during the pilot testing exercise. \n \n(2)  Phase  2:  Prepare  a  Capacity  Building  Strategy  for  RBOs  and  Regional \nWRAs  \n \n14.  Building on phase 1 outputs, phase 2 will prepare an initial assessment of countrywide \ncapacity development needs for RBOs and WRAs (para. 4). This will include analysis of (i) the \nCDAPs prepared under phase 1, comparing the results of  these assessments to other studies \non the capacity of regional WRAs; (ii) staff and logistical resource requirements for model \nrepresentative RBOs and WRAs; (iii) nationwide estimates of the number of model RBOs and \nWRAs required to manage the water sector in the decentralized environment; and (iv) the \noverall  capacity  gap  for  RBOs  and  WRAs  extrapolated  to  estimate  countrywide  long-term \ncapacity development requirements. Based on this analysis, and assessments of appropriate \ncapacity support mechanisms, a capacity building strategy for RBOs and regional WRAs will be \nprepared.  \n \n15.  The TA will support working groups (para. 18) to enable inclusive processes in the \nformulation of the strategy and to facilitate a better understanding in the oversight agencies of \nreal capacity constraints in the sector. It will also support the preparation of the capacity building \nwater resources sector cluster TA proposed in the CSP. \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will make \navailable a grant of $850,000 and the Government will provide $75,000 for the proposed TA \ntotal of $925,000. Government input will comprise in-kind contributions for counterpart staff and \noffice  accommodation  for  the  project  team;  and  DGWR  will  provide  partial  funding  for \ncounterpart staff and logistics, a subregional workshop in 2008, and a quarterly workshop in \n2009. DGWR will ensure that the 2009 annual work programs for the Participatory Irrigation \nSector Project (PISP) and other relevant programs include activities supporting implementation \nof CDAPs. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n10  The six provinces covered by the ongoing PISP, plus the provinces of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam and North \nSumatra.  ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months  from  the  date  of  TA  approval  and \nconcurrence of the Government. DGWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will \ncoordinate activities with ADB on behalf of the Implementing Agencies (BAPPENAS, DGWR, \nand WRAs). ADB will mobilize a team of consultants (15 person-months international and \n85 person-months  national)  to  support  implementation  of  the  TA.  The  consultants  will  be \nengaged by ADB using individual recruitment and quality-based selection11 for the firm, with the \nbiodata technical proposal, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference, together with an indicative list of \nconsultants, are in Appendix 4. Any equipment purchased through consultant contracts will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and transferred to DGWR at the end of the TA. \n \n18.  The  TA  will  be  led  by  a  national  consulting  firm,  forming  an  association  with \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  firm  will  be  supported  by  individually  recruited \noversight and specialist consultants. The proposed services allow for a number of \u201con call\u201d \nexperts  (national  and/or  international)  to  assist  in  enhancing  knowledge  and  strengthening \nindividuals/ organizations in the sector. The Government and CSO working groups will be \nestablished as a forum for debate and dialogue. Quarterly coordination workshops will be held \nto share the development of the TA outputs, and ensure project outcomes are disseminated \nefficiently through line agencies and stakeholders. Tripartite meetings will be held at least three \ntimes: at the end of the inception phase, after 6 months, and at TA completion. In addition to the \nconsultant\u2019s  routine  progress  reports,  working  group  meetings  will  provide  a  vehicle  for \ndissemination of TA outputs, together with a final TA workshop. \n   \n19.  The Implementing Agencies will establish effective mechanisms to engage with civil \nsociety  to  ensure  stakeholder  participation  in  the  development  of  CDAPs.  To  support  the \nprocess, the TA will use working groups and peer review processes in addition to traditional \nconsulting services and NGO facilitation activities.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for Capacity Building in Water Resources in a Decentralized \nEnvironment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n11 Quality-based selection is appropriate as the TA demands high quality services to ensure that the downstream \ncapacity  building  impacts  requested  by  the  Government  and  required  to  support  significant  ongoing  ADB \noperations in Indonesia, are delivered.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nContribute to environmental  By 2012, results based  Annual budgets and reporting  \u2022  Appropriate resources are \nsustainability  management introduced  systems (WRAs and regional  available to implement \n  as part of capacity  planning agencies)   CDAP. \ndevelopment program  \u2022  Process-driven capacity \nthroughout PISP districts  development approach is \nand Java water resources  adopted by committed \nservices  management. \n    \nRisks \n\u2022  National agencies fail to \nengage all stakeholders \nadequately. \n\u2022  Recentralization is adopted. \n\u2022  Staff resources and \nbudgets are insufficient to \nmeet roles and \nresponsibilities. \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved governance and  By 2010, routine process- Annual budgets and reporting  \u2022  All appropriate stakeholder \nwater resources  driven capacity  systems (WRAs and regional  groups engage with \nmanagement among  development programs  planning agencies)  capacity development \ndecentralized water  supported under the  initiatives. \nresources stakeholders  Government\u2019s budget in   \nTA provinces by   Risk \ncommitted managers  \u2022  Resources are not \n  allocated to capacity \nBy 2010, effective multi- development activities. \nstakeholder   \nrepresentation on river \nbasin councils throughout \nJava \n \nBy 2012, PISP districts \nare implementing district \nirrigation management \nplans with adequately \nfunded capacity \ndevelopment strategies \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

Capacity Development \n \n1.  Capacity Development Process1 \n1.  The capacity development process has three essential phases: \n \n(i)  Performance  analysis.  Identifying  performance  gaps  that  the  organization \nwishes to address. \n(ii)  Capacity  diagnostic  analysis.  Identifying  the  factors  leading  to  the \norganization\u2019s gaps. \n(iii)  Strategy development. Based on the diagnostic analysis, developing strategies \nto address factors that constrain capacity. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) evaluations of a number of capacity development \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  projects  indicate  that  such  a  systematic  capacity  development \nprocess is often not followed because of (i) development partners\u2019 bias toward pre-favored \ninterventions (e.g., training, scholarships, technology transfer, equipment purchase, etc.); and \n(ii) lack of capacity development capability of consulting firms working on capacity development \nprograms.  Capacity  development  investments  will  not  be  optimum  unless  there  is  holistic, \nsystematic, and rigorous prior analysis of capacity led by and involving key stakeholders in the \norganization.  \n \n3.  The capacity development process (strategies, pace, and sequencing) must be led by \nthe organization, with facilitation from outside (consultants) where assistance is needed. The \nconsultant  facilitator  can  provide  a  road  map,  help  avoid  barriers,  provide  monitoring  and \nfeedback, and support experience from lessons from similar experiences. Training and using \npeer reviewers from similar organizations can be cost-effective and add learning to the process. \nInternal  ownership,  fostered  from  leading  and  participating  in  performance  and  diagnostic \nanalyses, will lead to sustainability.  \n \n2.  Performance Analysis \n4.  Capacity development was defined by the United Nations Development Programme in \n1997 as  \n \nThe process by which individuals, groups, organizations, institutions and \nsocieties increase their abilities: to perform functions solve problems and \nachieve objectives; to understand and deal with their development need \nin a broader context and in a sustainable manner.  \n \n5.  Performance analysis is the first step in a capacity development intervention: \n \n(i)  What is the assigned mandate?  \n(ii)  Are  expected  results  clear  (outputs-products,  services,  deliverables,  and \noutcomes-benefits achieved, impacts)? \n(iii)  What is the level of performance (service quality and quantity)? \n                                                 \n1 The conceptual framework for capacity development and diagnostics will be reviewed and updated during the \ninception phase of the technical assistance (TA). ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n(iv)  Are there performance gaps? \n \n6.  There is a tendency not to ask these questions. However, in the drive to introduce \nresults based management and routine performance analysis in Indonesia, such questions are \nbecoming more common. Arguably, the most crucial step in the capacity development process \nis  defining  a  results  framework,  establishing  performance  monitoring,  and  developing \ninformation systems to obtain and monitor results for future organizational improvements.  \n \n3.  Capacity Diagnostic Analysis \n7.  The diagnostic process is not complex. It involves assessing why performance gaps \nexist  and  the  analysis  can  only  be  carried  out  effectively  from  within  an  organization.  A \nparticipatory, interactive approach to the analysis is required, with skilled process expertise \nassisting  managers  and  staff.  A  cause-effect  tree  analysis  is  a  practical,  effective,  and \nrecommended technique.  \n \n4.  Strategy Development \n8.  There  is  no  standard  strategy,  proven  design,  or  standard  template  for  successful \ncapacity development. However, there are well-grounded principles and a broad road map \n(Figure A2). If carefully followed, these will increase the chances of implementing a sound, \nefficient, and sustainable capacity development strategy.  \n \nFigure A2: Capacity Development Road Map \n \n \nInternally led, long term, holistic, process approach \nC\no Results Framework \nn Organizational    \ns Focus  Performance Gaps \nu\n \nl\nt Diagnostic Analysis \na Client led internal \n \nn\nfocus\nt\nS\nu\np Management \np\ncommitment \nCD Strategy \no\nr\nt\nCD= capacity development \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n ", " 10  Appendix 2 \n \nB.  Capacity Development Action Plans  \n1.  Preparation Process \n9.  Capacity development action plans (CDAPs) for water resources management will help \ngovernments define their capacity building strategy, detailed programs, and required funding. \nThe main elements of a CDAP are (i) framework (capacity development policy, water resources \nprogram  strategy,  and  planning  performance  targets);  (ii)  institutional  strengthening \n(organizational,  legal,  and  regulatory  environment  for  improved  governance);  (iii)  human \nresources management (systems and methods); (iv) human resources development (training \nand  education);  (v)  financing,  budgeting,  and  planning  (sustainable  systems);  and \n(vi) implementation and monitoring mechanisms. \n \n10.  A CDAP must cover a sufficiently long period of implementation to deliver meaningful \nbenefits. It will be designed as a medium-term action plan, broken down into annual action \nagendas and investment and recurrent budgets. The process of CDAP formulation, as adopted \nunder the Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization Project (SCBDP)2, is summarized \nas follows.  \n(i)  Needs assessment and diagnostic analysis. The local CDAP team will (a) \nmap  out  existing  capacity  problems  and  priority  actions,  and  (b)  develop \nstrategies in six main areas referred to in para. 11 and on gender. This is done \nthrough  intensive  consultation  between  various  agencies,  civil  society \norganizations (CSOs), and consumers; and is observed by the media. \n(ii)  Drafting of relevant components (strategy development) of the CDAP. This \nincludes  scheduling  short-  and  medium-term  measures  and  the  provision  of \ntechnical backstopping. \n(iii)  Present the draft CDAP for consultation among relevant agencies at district level. \n(iv)  Develop the CDAP budget through consultation between the CDAP team, local \nfinancial agency, and local parliament budgetary commission\u2014identifying local \nand external budgetary contributions. \n(v)  The draft CDAP is reviewed by the support team at national level.  \n(vi)  The CDAP is legalized by local parliament as part of the regional strategic plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

Capacity building needs assessments for local governments and legislatures3, carried \nout between November 1999 and October 2000, concluded that a capacity building strategy to \nimplement  the  current  decentralization  policy  in  Indonesia  should  start  with  seven  major \nelements. \n \n(i)  Improvement of the central Government\u2019s information and dissemination strategy. \n(ii)  Preparation of a non-prescriptive \u201cpositive list\u201d of local government functions. \n(iii)  Preparation of model regional regulations in key policy areas to ease the burden \nof the regions to put in place a multitude of new regulations within a very short \nperiod of time. \n(iv)  Review of sectoral regulations to ensure that the sectoral regulatory framework is \nin accordance with laws no. 22 and 25, 1999, and their implementing regulations. \n(v)  Clarification of the mechanism of transferring central government civil servants to \nthe regions and of the arrangements to merge central government institutions \nwith regional government institutions. \n(vi)  Improvement of coordination between central government agencies involved in \nthe decentralization policy.  \n(vii)  Focus on demand-driven capacity building programs that central government \nagencies can support with a mix of tools and instruments.  \n \n12.  This assessment resulted in a national capacity building framework that emphasizes the \nneed for involvement of the public and private sector. It also recommends eight policy clusters \nfor government action and external support: (i) regulatory framework, (ii) institutional reform \nmeasures,  (iii)  human  resources  management,  (iv)  regional  financial  management,  (v) \nstrengthening civil society and regional parliaments, (vi) participatory regional planning, (vii) \nlocal  economic  development,  and  (viii)  managing  the  transition  period.  In  addition,  it \nrecommends interventions at the system, institutional, and individual levels. \n \n2.  Capacity Development in Water Resources \n13.  Lessons  from  recent  project  completion  report  and  project  performance  evaluation \nreport4 reviews of the CBWRS project include the following. \n(i)  In-depth  understanding  of  organization  characteristics,  strengths,  and \nweaknesses leads to a more tailored approach to the activity design and program \ndistribution. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n ", " 12  Appendix 2 \n(ii)  The use of centralized projects to support capacity building activities in local \ngovernment  can  be  effective,  but  implementing  arrangements  and  fund  flow \nmechanisms should be carefully designed in a participatory manner. \n(iii)  Classical training has limited application. A varied form of on-the-job training for \ntrainees is generally more beneficial and better value, although it is more time-\nconsuming and expensive, and requires skilled delivery.  \n(iv)  Introduction of new management systems (e.g., results oriented management) \nshould be carefully combined or integrated to enhance existing planning and \nmanagement systems and local wisdom. Often, new techniques can best be \nsimply used to enhance and develop existing practices since poor translation of \nnew ideas can cause suspicion and nonacceptance.  \n(v)  Public  awareness  campaigns  have  proved  to  be  successful,  low-cost,  large \nimpact initiatives. \n(vi)  The ability of projects to adjust when challenged by external factors is important \nto increase project impact. Close monitoring and flexibility by the Government \nand ADB optimizes use of project resources. \n(vii)   As part of a holistic approach to capacity building, careful consideration should \nbe given to increasing outsourcing of activities and strengthening the capacity of \nlocal  consulting  nongovernment  and  CSOs  (nongovernment  organizations, \nuniversities, etc.). \n(viii)  Capacity building projects often focus on easy-to-monitor activities and outputs \n(training days, equipment purchase) rather than less tangible outcomes (quality \nof hydrological databases, implementation of effective river basin management) \nwhich reflect increased capacity. There is a need to continue to search for, and \nfocus on, the real impact indicators. \n(ix)  The success of capacity building is highly dependent on strong commitment from \nthe  target  individuals,  managers,  and  institutions.  Stakeholder  ownership  is \nessential during project design, with the understanding that capacity building \nprograms are long-term commitments. \n \n14.  Specific follow-up actions agreed between ADB and the Government during post-project \nevaluations of the CBWRS included the following: (i) developing systems for improved access to  \nknowledge-based systems; (ii) the requirements for further development of human resources \nmanagement, including manpower planning, performance appraisals, promotion, and incentives \nmanagement will be assessed; (iii) central government funding to the water resources master\u2019s \nprogram  will  continue  in  accordance  with  needs-based  assessments;  (iv)  ADB  and  the \nDirectorate  General  of  Water  Resources  (DGWR)  will  jointly  review  the  Water  Resources \nDevelopment Center activities included in the recently signed Participatory Irrigation Sector \nProject5,  and  adjust  activities  to  take  into  account  lessons  from  the  CBWRS  and  current \nrequirements of the Water Resources Data Center, if appropriate; (v) increased training and \nsupport for hydrological data collection, data processing, and management information systems \nshould be provided to provincial water resources services; and (vi) ADB should remain an \nengaged and supportive partner to the Government\u2019s continued efforts to raise capacity in the \nwater resources sector. ADB and the Government should carefully review the need for follow-up \nprograms and capacity building needs on all ongoing projects during routine portfolio reviews. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.
