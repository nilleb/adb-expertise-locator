THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \nA.  Analysis of Key Issues \n1.  Financial inclusion continues to be on the world\u2019s development goals agenda with an \nestimated 1.7 billion people globally still without an account either with a financial institution or \nthrough a mobile money provider.1 Most of these are from developing economies, such as \nBangladesh, India, Indonesia and Pakistan. While progress has been made in reducing the \nunbanked population number, there is a persistent gender gap in women\u2019s access to even basic \naccounts in the financial system, with 56% remaining unbanked (footnote 1). Increased access to \nfinancial services and products requires a more gender inclusive financial system that addresses \nthe specific demand- and supply-side barriers women and women\u2019s businesses face. 2 \n \n2.  Many financial institutions (FIs) in developing economies often do not have a specific focus \nor understanding of the market challenges and potential for underserved customer segments, \nsuch as women borrowers.3 Moreover, incentives to reach this target group are often absent. \nTherefore, many FIs do not actively target women and women\u2019s businesses and consequently, \naffordable products and services remain out of reach in ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs).  \n \n3.  The emergence and spread of the corona virus disease (COVID-19) will exacerbate \nbarriers to finance for women borrowers. Emerging evidence suggests that in lower- and low-\nincome countries, lost income will result in an increase in relative poverty for informal workers and \ntheir families and that compared to men\u2019s lives, women\u2019s economic and productive lives are \ndisproportionately and differently affected.4 The hardest hit sectors include retail trade and service \nindustries such as street vending and domestic work-typically low-wage jobs that rely on in-person \nconnections and often carried out by women.5 Small women\u2019s businesses have lost their incomes \nand often do not have necessary cash reserves to survive for a longer period or face barriers to \naccess finance to adapt their business models to the \u201cnew normal\u201d environment. A survey on the \nimpact of COVID-19 on women\u2019s businesses in Papua New Guinea (PNG) has for example found \nthat 40.9% of smaller or semi-formal businesses have reported a temporary halt in operations. 6 \n \n4.  COVID-19 has also reinforced the crucial importance of a digital economy, i.e. to change \nbusiness models into digital business models and to integrate digital channels into how financial \nservice providers or businesses engage with customers. It is expected that by 2025, digital \nfinancial services will give the world a $3.7 trillion (or 6%) GDP boost, creating 95 million new \njobs, $2.1 trillion in new credit, and $4.2 trillion in new deposits.7 Albeit the study is from 2016, the \nfindings are still relevant and COVID-19 is expected to accelerate the efforts for the digital \ntransformation. 8 \n \n \n1  World Bank, Global Findex 2017. \n2  Women\u2019s businesses can comprise micro- small and medium women-owned or women-managed businesses and \nin line with respective country definitions, if available. \n3  Financial institutions in this context are banks and non-bank financial institutions including microfinance institutions, \nhousing finance, and insurance companies, for instance. \n4  UN Women 2020, Policy Brief: The Impact of COVID-19 on Women, 9 April 2020. \n5  Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), #3 Social Protection Responses to Covid-\n19, 2020. \n6  CIBE 2020.

COVID-19 A digital technology agenda driving an accelerated transition to the new normal. June 2020 \n ", "2 \n5.  ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations have supported financial inclusion of women through its \nvarious instruments and programs with a good track record. This includes credit lines to FIs \nonlending to individual women borrowers and/or women entrepreneurs. ADB has also provided \nequity  to  support  FIs  that  are  financing  women,  such  as  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs). \nTechnical assistance has been used to develop products for women borrowers, expand financial \nliteracy training, fund marketing campaigns geared at potential women borrowers, and create and \nenhance digital finance solutions that will better serve women borrowers, for instance. Such \ntransactions have defined gender targets that support women\u2019s access to finance with additional \nfeatures in certain transactions supporting geographic regions where women are particularly \nunderserved. Through ADB\u2019s Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program, ADB \nprovides guarantees to partner FIs\u2019 local currency loans to MFIs, which expands access to finance \nfor the lower-income populations in DMCs, mostly in rural areas and women. As of end September \n2020, ADB has facilitated over $1.36 billion in financing through the program, reaching 7 million \nborrowers of whom 98% are women.  \n \n6.  The  proposed technical  assistance  builds  on and  expands  ADB\u2019s  gender  initiatives \nthrough FIs. The TA will fund the development of an online platform, which is expected to increase \ngender-responsive financing and provide innovative digital solutions to address the changing \nbusiness environment. To help reduce barriers for women and women\u2019s businesses to access \nfinance concerted efforts in dissemination of best practices and results and continued support to \npartner FIs and women\u2019s businesses is necessary.9 The \u201cWomen\u2019s Financing Marketplace\u201d (or \nthe Marketplace) is also expected to create more visibility on partnerships, such as with the \nWomen\u2019s Entrepreneur Finance Initiative (We-Fi) which supports ADB\u2019s innovative activities for \nimproving access to finance to women businesses in Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam and also \nfinances specific activities under the TA.  \n \n7.  As mentioned, the need for a digital ecosystem has become even more crucial with the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The Marketplace will, therefore, be innovative in its work and take a digital \napproach for interaction and engagement as it will, among others, engage also through social \nmedia channels to build a subscriber and follower list and facilitate the engagement of an online \ncommunity through linkages and resources on content relevant for the FIs and their female \nborrowers.10  \n \n8.   As  a  starting  point,  the  platform  will  have  various  case  studies  or  other  type  of \ncommunications aggregating in one location the work that has been done through ADB for FIs \nonlending to women, including through TAs. The Marketplace will further; (i) provide support and \ncapacity building to FIs through digital toolkits, webinars and online support; and (ii) support \nidentification and development of cutting-edge technologies, such as for example alternative \ngender-responsive credit scoring models11, through crowd sourcing technologies and digital \nsandbox programs, which will be piloted in one or two countries first (Papua New Guinea has \nbeen identified as the first).  \n \nB.  Justification for Cluster Modality \n \n9.  As the Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace is a new initiative, there are no funds attached to \nit which would provide for the initial IT infrastructure set-up and maintenance of the site. A \nseparate transaction technical assistance cluster (TA) is proposed. The TA adopts a cluster \n \n9  Barriers are for example limited financial literacy, insufficient credit history, lack of collateral. \n10  For example, content on women\u2019s businesses and sustainability/green lending. \n11  A gender-responsive credit scoring model would consider also women specific data or behavior for the algorithms. \n ", "3 \nmodality for four reasons: (i) it provides an opportunity to develop the Marketplace on a small \nscale and expand gradually without tying down the entire projected TA resource requirements at \nthe outset; (ii) it allows the TA to be more flexible and responsive to the needs of FIs and women\u2019s \nbusinesses by adding features, tools, and linkages; (iii) it facilitates a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach by \nworking with other departments or available funding sources for development of support products \nwithout having to use the TA resources, and (iv) it is more efficient than processing individual \nstandalone TAs each year. Staff engaged in the Marketplace will, for example, work with ADB\u2019s \nInformation  Technology  Department  (ITD)  for  innovation  challenges  and  digital  sandbox \nprograms to identify digital solutions to improve FIs\u2019 financial service delivery channels.12 Related \nto this, funds from the WAVES program will be used for activities in the Pacific.13 \n \n10.  The proposed TA is designed to support (i) the design, set-up, and maintenance of the \nMarketplace; (ii) aggregation and dissemination of products, results, best practice examples on \ngender financing within ADB and to a broader audience; (iii) support for the implementation of \nhackathons and digital sandboxes together with ITD on innovations for digital financial service \ndelivery; (iv) capacity building for FIs to improve their gender-responsive financing efforts, and \nwomen\u2019s businesses to sustainably grow their businesses, as needed; (v) linkages to other \nprograms and initiatives on enabling access to finance for women, internal and external to ADB14; \nand (vi) fostering a community platform.. Further details on the subprojects are provided in Annex \n2. The TA will be regional in nature as it will support FIs, as well as women\u2019s businesses in all of \nADB\u2019s DMCs. The TA will have various subprojects. After completion of subproject 1, a review \nwill take place before the Marketplace will be expanded with additional features according to the \nfeedback from FIs and other partners.15 \n \n11.  The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities including (i) addressing \nremaining poverties and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; and \n(iii) promoting rural development and food security.16 The expansion of access to finance for low \nincome women supports ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Priority 2 on Gender Equality.17 Inclusive \nfinance is also one of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan which was re-\naffirmed in its 2016 review.18  \n \nC.  Outcome and Outputs \n12.  Overall outcome. The TA will have the following overall outcome: sustainable financial \ninclusion for women and women\u2019s businesses increased. Through a combination of different \nsupport mechanisms and digital tools for financial institutions19, women and women\u2019s businesses \nwill receive more financing to sustainably grow their business and become more resilient. TA \nsubprojects will generally deliver all or some of the following outputs, as to be specified by each \ntransaction TA subproject proposal. \n \n13.  Output 1: Finalized design, set-up, and maintenance of the Women\u2019s Financing \nMarketplace (Subprojects 1 and 4). The TA will support design of the Marketplace. This will \n \n12  ADB.

Output 2: Innovative technologies designed to support digital gender-responsive \necosystems (Subproject 2). The TA will e.g. support FIs (footnote 3) in the identification and \ndevelopment of cutting-edge technology solutions for digital, gender- responsive financial service \ndelivery in a safe environment with a potential to commercially pilot such solutions. The support \nwill, among others, be carried out with ITD using crowd sourcing technology or digital sandboxes \n(footnote 12).  \n \n15.  Output  3:  Capacity  building  to  financial  institutions  and  women\u2019s  businesses \nconducted (Subproject 3). The TA will support capacity building of FIs (on areas to be defined) \nand women\u2019s businesses on improving the viability of their businesses.  \n \nD.  Cost and Indicative Financing \n16.  The TA is expected not to exceed $2,500,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nmultiple donors, including but not limited to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF), \nWe-Fi, and other donors\u2019 contributions. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will \nbe presented in each TA subproject proposal submitted for approval. ADB will seek cost-matching \nfrom its client as much as possible. \n \n17.  The first subproject is estimated to cost $600,000 and financing of subsequent subprojects \nis subject to availability of TA funds or other co-financing sources. The funds will cover website \ndevelopment, IT infrastructure (as necessary), one or two commercial pilots, preparation of \ntraining  and  capacity  building  materials,  remuneration,  travel,  and  per  diem  for \ninternational/national  consultants;  conference-related  or  seminar  expenditures;  and \nmiscellaneous expenses.20  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will administer the TA and its Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s, Financial \nInstitutions Division will implement the cluster TA and each subproject. Disbursement under the \ncluster TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2020,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  \nJanuary 2021\u2013 December 2024. Each TA subproject proposal will be submitted for approval to \nDirector General, PSOD, in accordance with the business process for transaction TA cluster \nprocessing. Subproject activities will start only after approval.  \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  DECEMBER 2020 \u2013 DECEMBER 2024 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  ADB \n \n20  If ADB staff is used as resource personnel, travel related expenses will be charged to the TA. \n ", "5 \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementing agencies  Private Sector Operations Department, Financial Institutions Division  \nKey Consultants for  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by  \nsubproject 1   Design and Social  Individual Consultant  ADB, subproject 1 \n(consultants for  Media Consultant  Selection Method \nsubsequent subprojects  Business Development  Individual Consultant  ADB, subproject 1 \nwill be defined according  and Content Manager  Selection Method \nto demand)  Digital Content Curator  Individual Consultant  ADB, subproject 1 \n  Selection Method \nWebsite Layout and  Shopping/RFQ  ADB, subproject 1 \nGraphic design   Procedure \nProject Coordinator  Individual Consultant  ADB, subproject 1 \nSelection Method \nAdvance contracting and  Use of advance contracting or retroactive financing will be specified in \nretroactive financing  each subproject proposal, if necessary.
