A  review  of  its \nenvironmental implications indicates that several actions included in \nthe policy framework of this subprogram are likely to have positive \nenvironmental  impact.  Enhancement  measures  have  been \ndeveloped  to  optimize  this  positive  impact.  No  action  has  been \nidentified as likely to have a negative environmental impact. \n   \nProgram Description  The proposed program cluster will help the Government of Viet Nam \ncarry  out  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation of the poverty reduction program embedded in the \nSocioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. To this end, \nSIPRP V will provide parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s poverty \nreduction support credits (PRSCs) 7\u20139 within the framework of the \nPRSC process.  \n \nSubprogram  1  will  provide  parallel  financing  with  PRSC  7  and \nsupport actions included in its policy matrix. The Government, the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  and  other \ndevelopment agencies participating in the PRSC process agreed on \nthe policy matrix for PRSC 7 after a series of consultations in 2007 \nand  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  The  policy  matrix  is  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda and includes a wide spectrum of policy \nactions in business development, social inclusion, natural resource \nmanagement, and governance. Subprogram 1 will focus on those \nactions  in  the  policy  matrix  for  PRSC  7  that  complement  policy \nactions supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam or are \notherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in this country.  \n   \nRationale  Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction over \nthe last 15 years by carrying out a broad range of policy reforms to \nfoster  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth  and strengthen \nsocial protection. Since 2002, an increasing number of multilateral \nand bilateral development agencies have supported these reforms \nthrough the World Bank\u2013led PRSC process. \n \nThe PRSC process comprises several closely related activities jointly \nundertaken each year by participating development agencies to help \n ", "ii   \nthe Government carry out policy reforms needed for the successful \nimplementation  of  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  process \ninvolves  the  preparation  of  Viet  Nam  development  reports  by \nparticipating  agencies,  consultations  on  the  policy  matrices  for \nPRSCs among participating agencies and between these agencies \nand the Government, and general budget support (in the form of \ngrants and concessional loans) to Viet Nam by participating agencies \nto cover some of the costs of the policy reforms to the budget. The \nWorld  Bank  coordinates  PRSC  activities  for  the  participating \ndevelopment agencies. \n \nADB joined the PRSC process in 2003 and has taken part in all \nPRSC  activities  since  then.  In  2004\u20132007,  ADB  approved  four \nsingle-tranche  standard  program  loans  (one  loan  every  year)  to \nViet Nam to support, through the PRSC process, the implementation \nof  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  programs.  SIPRPs  I\u2013III \nprovided  parallel  financing  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSCs 3\u20135, \nrespectively, in support of the implementation of the Government\u2019s \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy 2002\u20132010. \nSIPRP IV provided parallel financing with PRSC 6 in support of the \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. \n \nWith SIPRP V, ADB will stay involved in the PRSC process through \n2010,  that  is,  until  the  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  is \ncompleted. This will enable ADB to promote, with relatively modest \nfinancing, a wide spectrum of policy reforms that are essential for the \nsuccessful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. Consequently, the \nproposed  program  cluster  will  help  ADB  achieve  the  strategic \nobjective  of  its  country  strategy  and  program  2007\u20132010  for \nViet Nam, which is to help the Government reduce the poverty rate \nto  10%\u201311%  by  2010  through  the  successful  implementation  of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \nFurthermore,  continued  participation  in  the  PRCS  process  will \nprovide  ADB  with  another  means  of  coordinating  its  activities  in \nViet Nam with those of other development agencies. SIPRP V will \nhelp  ADB  fulfill  its  obligations  under  the  Rome  Declaration  on \nHarmonization (2003), the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness \n(2005), and the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness (2005).  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The intended impact of SIPRP V is a continued reduction in poverty \nin Viet Nam in 2008\u20132010 and beyond. Its expected outcome is the \nsuccessful implementation of the Government\u2019s SEDP 2006\u20132010, \nwhich will not only reduce poverty in 2006\u20132010 but also improve \nViet  Nam\u2019s  economic  competitiveness  and  strengthen  the \nfoundations for sustainable and inclusive growth and a continued \nreduction in poverty beyond 2010. \n   \nCost Estimates  Some of the actions that are included in the policy framework of \nsubprogram 1 of SIPRP V entail substantial costs to Viet Nam\u2019s state \nbudget. The actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 are \n ", "  iii \nestimated to cost the state budget $450 million in 2008 and 2009.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  World  Bank  has  already  approved  PRSC  7  amounting  to \n$150 million  from  the  International  Development  Association.  A \ndozen  other  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC \nprocess  (including  ADB)  are  expected  to  provide  grants  or \nconcessional  loans  totaling  about  $200  million  in  cofinancing  or \nparallel financing with PRSC 7. The remaining costs to the budget of \nthe actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 will be covered \nby the Government. \n   \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nTerms  Drawing  Rights  16,439,000  be  provided  for  subprogram  1  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% during the amortization period; and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The loan \nproceeds may be used to finance eligible imports incurred within \n180 days before the date of loan effectiveness.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The loan will be fully utilized by 31 December 2009. \n   \nDisbursement  All actions included in the policy framework of subprogram 1 have \nbeen completed. Therefore, the proposed loan will be disbursed in a \nsingle tranche once the loan is declared effective. \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports financed from other bilateral and multilateral sources. As \nprovided in ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans (1998), the proceeds of \nthe  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of \nViet Nam as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will \nbe required provided that the value of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus \nimports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance is at least equal \nto the amount of the loan to be disbursed. The Government will \ncertify its compliance with this formula with its withdrawal request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be \nrequired. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. As such, \nthe procedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the \nuse of counterpart funds, are felt to be satisfactory. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will be the Executing Agency for \nthe proposed program cluster. SBV hosts the PRSC coordination \nunit,  which  facilitates  interactions  between  the  Government  and \ndevelopment agencies within the framework of the PRSC process. \nSBV was also the Executing Agency for SIPRPs I\u2013IV. \n   \n ", "iv   \nLoans for  A loan for subprogram 2 will be proposed to the Board of Directors in \nSubprograms 2 and 3  2009 and a loan for subprogram 3 will be proposed in 2010 after the \npolicy  actions  to  be  covered  by  the  subprogram  concerned  are \ncompleted. Tentatively, the amounts (in US dollars) and the terms of \nthese loans will be the same as those of the proposed loan for \nsubprogram 1. Hence, the tentative total amount of the proposed \nprogram cluster will be $75.0 million.  \n   \nProgram Benefits and  The policy reforms that the proposed program cluster will advance \nBeneficiaries  will yield considerable economic benefits to Viet Nam. They will raise \nthe living standards of the Vietnamese people and reduce poverty by \nfostering  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive \neconomic growth. The policy reforms in the area of social inclusion \nwill be particularly beneficial to the poor and the near-poor.  \n \nThe policy reforms supported by SIPRP V will also increase budget \nrevenue  by  expanding  the  tax  base,  and  will  reduce  budget \nexpenditure  by  improving  public  finance  management.  Over  the \nmedium  term,  the  financial  benefits  of  these  reforms  to  the \nGovernment are likely to exceed their costs (including interest to be \npaid on loans received from various development agencies within the \nframework of the PRSC process). \n   \nAssumptions and  The  proposed  program  cluster  will  support  policy  actions  that \nRisks   constitute critical steps in policy reforms needed for the successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and are particularly relevant to \nADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam. The reforms, however, must be fully \ncarried out if SEDP 2006\u20132010 is to be successfully implemented. \nTherefore, it is assumed that, after completing the policy actions \ncovered by SIPRP V and the other actions included in the policy \nmatrices for PRSCs 7\u20139, the Government will follow through with the \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP \n2006\u20132010 on its own or with the support of development agencies \nunder  other  projects.  It  is  further  assumed  that  the  investment \nprojects that are included in SEDP 2006\u20132010 and necessary for \nattaining its targets and goals will be implemented on schedule.  \n \nThese assumptions are based on the Government\u2019s commitment to \ncarry out the policy reforms and implement the investment projects \nthat are needed to achieve the targets and goals of SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010.  Furthermore,  the  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the \nsuccessful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 are now or will be \nsupported by ADB through other policy-based loans to Viet Nam and \nby  other  development  agencies  both  within  and  outside  the \nframework of the PRSC process. \n \nThere is a risk that inflation, which accelerated markedly  in late 2007 \nand early 2008, will stay high long enough to preclude the successful \nimplementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  and,  in  particular,  the \nachievement of its poverty reduction target. There is also a risk that \nthe ongoing global financial crisis and economic slowdown combined \n ", "  v \nwith the macroeconomic stabilization measures taken recently by the \nGovernment will slacken growth in Viet Nam to a degree that will \nrender some targets and goals of SEDP 2006\u20132010 (including the \npoverty reduction target) impossible to attain. \n \nHowever, the macroeconomic situation in Viet Nam has started to \nimprove.  Monthly  inflation  decelerated  significantly  in  June\u2013\nSeptember 2008, and there was deflation in October 2008. As a \nresult, year-on-year inflation fell in September\u2013October 2008. At the \nsame  time,  economic  growth  slowed  down  only  moderately  and \nstayed quite high by international standards. Moreover, Viet Nam\u2019s \neconomic prospects in the medium to long term remain good. Hence, \nthe risks that SEDP 2006\u20132010 will not be successfully implemented \nand the expected outcome of the proposed program cluster will not \nbe attained are rather small. \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Support for the Implementation of \nthe Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V, comprising three subprograms, and (ii) a proposed \nloan for subprogram 1 of the SIPRP V. The design and monitoring framework for the proposed \nprogram cluster is in Appendix 1. \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has been one of the fastest growing in Asia in the last two decades. \nGrowth was particularly strong in the last several years, with real gross domestic product (GDP) \nincreasing by 8.1% yearly on average in 2003\u20132007. In 2007, real GDP grew by 8.5%, the \nhighest rate since 1996. GDP per capita at current prices rose from $441 in 2002 to $818 in \n2007, and GDP per capita in dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP) from $1,649 to $2,587. \n \n3.  In  recent  years,  however,  growth  of  aggregate  demand  has  outpaced  growth  of \naggregate supply. While expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and extensive borrowing \nand spending by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have fueled the growth of aggregate demand, \nthe growth of aggregate supply has been constrained by infrastructure bottlenecks, relatively \nlow efficiency of public investment, and increasingly acute shortages of skilled labor. As a result, \ninternal and external macroeconomic imbalances have emerged.  \n \n4.  On the domestic side, average annual inflation jumped from 1.8% in 1999\u20132003 to 7.9% \nin 2004\u20132007. Inflation was quite high in late 2007 and the first half of 2008, with food prices \nrising particularly fast. In June 2008, the consumer price index was 26.8% higher than in \nJune 2007, and the index of food items (with a combined weight of almost 43% in the consumer \nprice index) was 45.6% higher. Period-average inflation reached 20.3% in January\u2013June 2008. \nThe high inflation was not only due to the excessively rapid growth in aggregate demand in \n2007, but also due to increases in world commodity prices (especially energy and food prices) in \n2007 and the first half of 2008 and the supply-side shocks of late 2007 and early 2008 (including \nthe outbreak of pig and poultry epidemics, unusually harsh winter in the northern provinces, and \nfloods in the central provinces). \n \n5.  In the external sector, the current account balance turned from a surplus in 1999\u20132001 \nto a deficit in 2002\u20132007 and the first half of 2008. Moreover, the current account deficit \nwidened from 0.4% of GDP in 2006 to 9.6% of GDP in 2007 and about 23% of GDP in January\u2013\nJune 2008. Exports grew fast, but imports grew even faster, resulting in sharp increases in the \ntrade deficit. At the same time, inflows of foreign capital, especially foreign direct investment, \nremained strong. Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in early 2007 \nmade its policy framework more predictable and the country more attractive to foreign investors. \nNet foreign direct investment inflows, which ranged between $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion in \n2003\u20132006,  surged  to  $6.6  billion  in  2007  and  $4.2 billion  in  the  first  6  months  of  2008. \nConsequently, the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus in both 2007 and the first half \nof 2008. Gross official international reserves almost doubled from $11.5 billion at the end of \n2006 to an estimated $21.4 billion at the end of June 2008.  \n \n6.  In response to accelerating inflation and the ballooning current account deficit, in April \n2008 the Government changed its top policy priority from maintaining high growth rates to \n ", "2   \ncurbing inflation and the trade deficit. In January\u2013June 2007, it took a range of measures to \nachieve these objectives. In particular, it tightened monetary and fiscal policies and its control \nover investments by SOEs. The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) raised the reserve requirements \nfor  banks  and  the  policy  interest  rates.  While  budgetary  expenditure  on  targeted  social \nassistance programs increased, administrative and capital expenditures were cut substantially. \nInvestments by SOEs (especially in noncore businesses) were curtailed.  \n \n7.  There are signs that these measures are restraining the growth of aggregate demand \nand reducing the macroeconomic imbalances. Money supply, which expanded by 46.1% in \n2007,  grew  at  an  annualized  rate  of  8.5%  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  The  balance  of  the \nconsolidated budget turned from a deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.3% of GDP \nin January\u2013September 2008. Year-on-year GDP growth moderated to 6.5% in the first 9 months \nof 2008. Monthly inflation fell from 3.9% in May 2008 to 0.2% in September 2008, and there was \n0.2% deflation in October 2008. Food prices stabilized by September 2008 and fell by 0.4% in \nOctober 2008. Year-on-year inflation dropped from 28.3% in August 2008 to 26.7% in October \n2008. The monthly trade deficit narrowed from $3.2 billion in March 2008 to less than $1.0 \nbillion in June\u2013October 2008. In a sign of continued optimism among foreign investors about \nViet  Nam\u2019s  medium-term  economic  prospects,  new  foreign  direct  investment  commitments \nsurged to $59.3 billion in January\u2013October 2008 from $21.3 billion in all of 2007. \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n1.  Recent Progress in Poverty Reduction \n8.  Viet Nam has reduced poverty dramatically over the last 15\u201320 years (Appendix 2). \nAccording to the most recent available household survey data, the poverty rate (based on the \ncost of a consumption basket allowing for a daily intake of 2,100 calories per person and some \nnonfood expenditure) dropped from 58.1% in 1993 to 16.0% in 2006.1 The food poverty rate fell \nfrom 24.9% to 6.7% over the same period, while the poverty gap narrowed from 18.5% to \n3.8%.2  \n \n9.  Measures of poverty not based on household survey data point to declines of similar \nmagnitudes in poverty, even though they give different levels of poverty. In particular, the \nproportion of people living on less than $1.0 (at PPP) per day dropped from 50.8% of the total \npopulation in 1990 to 4.0% in 2007, and the proportion living on less than $2.0 (at PPP) per day \nfell from 87.0% to 32.9%.3 The poverty rate based on the methodology of the Ministry of Labor, \nInvalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) fell from 22.0% in 2005 to an estimated 14.7% in 2007.4  \n \n                                                \n1  World Bank. 2007. Vietnam Development Report 2008: Social Protection. Joint donor report to the Vietnam \nConsultative Group Meeting, Hanoi, 6\u20137 December 2007. \n2   The food poverty rate is the proportion of people whose total expenditure would not be enough for a daily intake of \n2,100 calories even if it were entirely allocated to food. The poverty gap is the difference between the poverty line \nand the average expenditure of the poor expressed as a percentage of the former. \n3   World Bank. 2008. East Asia: Testing Times Ahead. Washington, DC. \n4  The poverty rate based on the methodology of the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) \nmeasures the proportion of people living below the official poverty line, which is D260,000 per person in urban \nareas and D200,000 per person in rural areas. Households below the poverty line are identified by local officials of \nMOLISA through a combination of their personal knowledge, survey techniques, and village discussions.  \n \n ", "  3 \n10.  Accordingly, Viet Nam has made good progress toward the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). It has already achieved four MDG targets and is likely to attain another four \nahead of time. Besides the targets related to extreme poverty and hunger, Viet Nam has \nachieved the targets concerning the gender gap in primary and secondary education and the \nincidence of malaria and other diseases. It has not yet attained but is likely to achieve the \ntargets relating to the completion of primary schooling by boys and girls, under-five mortality, \nmaternal mortality, and the spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n11.  A  combination  of  robust  economic  growth  and  more  efficient  social  protection  has \nenabled Viet Nam to make such great strides in poverty reduction. Economic growth has \ncreated new jobs, raised incomes, and lifted millions of people out of poverty. But economic \ngrowth alone would not have enabled Viet Nam to reduce poverty as much as it has done. Many \nof those who have not benefited directly from economic growth (often for reasons beyond their \ncontrol) have been lifted out of poverty or prevented from falling into poverty because more \nresources have become available for social protection (thanks to the robust economic growth) \nand social protection has become significantly more efficient.  \n2.  Poverty Reduction Support Credit Process \n12.  The main reason why Viet Nam has been able to sustain strong economic growth for a \nlong time and to improve the efficiency of social protection significantly is that, since launching \nthe Doi Moi program in 1986, the country has carried out a broad range of policy reforms \nfostering  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth  and  making  social  protection  more \ntargeted. In particular, Viet Nam has been undertaking gradual transition from a command to a \nmarket economy, and from a social protection system that relies heavily on price subsidies to a \nsystem based on targeted programs. It has also continuously strengthened natural resource \nmanagement and improved governance. Since 2002, more and more multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment  agencies have  supported these reforms through  the World  Bank\u2013led  poverty \nreduction support credit (PRSC) process.  \n \n13.  The PRSC process comprises several closely related activities jointly undertaken each \nyear by participating development agencies to help the Government carry out the policy reforms \nneeded  for  the  successful  implementation  of  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  process \ninvolves  the  preparation  of  Viet  Nam  development  reports  by  participating  agencies, \nconsultations on the policy matrices for the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs among participating agencies \nand between these agencies and the Government, and general budget support (in the form of \ngrants and concessional loans) to Viet Nam by participating agencies to cover some of the \nadjustment costs of the policy reforms to the budget. The World Bank coordinates PRSC \nactivities for the participating development agencies. \n  \n14.  While the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy largely determines its reform agenda, \nthe Viet Nam development reports translate this agenda into specific policy actions. Because a \nsustained reduction in poverty requires continued and balanced progress in a wide range of \npolicy reforms, the Government has an extensive reform agenda and the Viet Nam development \nreports specify numerous policy actions in many different areas.  \n \n15.  Some of these actions are included in the policy matrices for PRSCs. During the year \nbefore that of the expected approval of a particular PRSC by the World Bank, the participating \ndevelopment agencies agree among themselves and the Government on an initial list of actions \nto be included in the policy matrix for the PRSC. At the start of the year when the PRSC is to be \n ", "4   \napproved by the World Bank, the agencies hold joint consultations with the Government on the \nstatus of the policy actions on the initial list. When the World Bank undertakes the appraisal and \nthe negotiations for the PRSC (usually in May of the year when the PRSC is expected to be \napproved), the agencies and the Government agree on the final list of policy actions for that \nPRSC. Some actions that were included in the initial list are modified or dropped at this stage, in \nview of their status and likelihood of being completed before the World Bank\u2019s Executive Board \ndeliberates on the PRSC.  \n \n16.  Actions in all key reform areas are usually included in the policy matrices for PRSCs to \nhelp the Government make balanced progress in reforms across various areas and fully carry \nout its reform agenda. Therefore, the policy matrices for PRSCs tend to be fairly broad in scope \nand  to  closely  match  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  This  makes  the  PRSC  process \nattractive to a large number of development agencies (focusing on different areas of policy \nreforms) and contributes to the strong government ownership of the actions included in the \npolicy matrices for PRSCs.  \n \n17.  At the same time, the good-practice principle of criticality in development policy lending \nby  the World  Bank  guides  the  selection  of  policy  actions  within  a  particular  reform  area. \nAccording to this principle, only those actions that are critical to the achievement of results \nshould be made conditions for disbursement.5 Therefore, the policy matrices for PRSCs include \nonly those actions that the participating development agencies and the Government consider to \nbe critical steps in the reform process in the area concerned and for which the Government \nneeds the combined support of many development agencies. The Government follows through \nwith the reform process on its own or with the support of development agencies under other \nprojects. This approach helps keep the policy matrices for PRSCs manageable despite their \nbroad scope. But it also limits the continuity of actions included in the policy matrices for various \nPRSCs. \n \n18.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) joined the PRSC process in 2003 and has taken \npart  in  all  PRSC  activities  since  then.  In  2004,  ADB  approved  SIPRP  I,  a  single-tranche \nstandard program loan of $6.4 million. SIPRP I provided parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s \nPRSC  3  in  support  of  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) 2002\u20132006. SIPRP II and SIPRP III ($15 million \neach) were approved in 2005 and 2006 and provided parallel financing with PRSC 4 and PRSC \n5, respectively. Like SIPRP I, SIPRP II and SIPRP III were single-tranche standard program \nloans, which supported the implementation of CPRGS 2002\u20132006. With support from ADB, the \nWorld Bank, and other development agencies through the PRSC process, the policy reforms \nneeded for the successful implementation of CPRGS 2002\u20132006 were carried out and most of \nthe CPRGS goals were achieved.6 \n3.  Socioeconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 \n19.  SEDP 2006\u20132010 was adopted by the Government in 2006. Unlike previous SEDPs, it \nwas prepared in an open and participatory manner involving extensive consultations with civil \nsociety,  businesses,  and  development  agencies,  and  is  oriented  more  toward  attaining \n                                                \n5  World Bank. 2005.

Its targets include a reduction in the poverty rate (based on MOLISA\u2019s methodology) \nfrom 22% in 2005 to 10%\u201311% in 2010. SEDP 2006\u20132010 also aspires to strengthen the \nfoundations  for  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive  economic  growth  and  a \ncontinued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. It provides for a broad range of policy reforms and \na large number of investment projects aimed at achieving its targets and goals. The joint \nInternational Development Association (IDA)\u2013International Monetary Fund staff advisory note of \n5 December 2006 on Viet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy concluded that SEDP 2006\u20132010 \nhas the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to lead to economic growth and \npoverty reduction.7 \n \n20.  Since late 2006, the PRSC process has supported the policy reforms needed for the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  In  2007,  about  a  dozen  multilateral  and \nbilateral development agencies, including ADB, provided general budget support to Viet Nam \nwithin the framework of the PRSC process to help the Government keep these reforms on track \nin 2007. In particular, the World Bank approved PRSC 6 amounting to $175 million from IDA in \nJune 2007, and ADB approved the $15.0-million SIPRP IV (another single-tranche standard \nprogram loan) for this purpose in October 2007.  \n \n21.  Significant progress was made in 2007 toward achieving the outcome of SIPRP IV and \nthe targets of SEDP 2006\u20132010. The poverty rate based on the MOLISA\u2019s methodology fell \nfrom 22.0% in 2005 to 14.7% in 2007. The ratio of merchandise exports to GDP increased from \n63% in 2005 to about 70% in 2007, exceeding the SIPRP IV outcome performance target of \n65% in 2010. The share of the domestic private sector in total investment reached 41%, well \nabove the 34% in 2006 and the SIPRP IV target of 35% in 2010. The proportion of underweight \nchildren in 2007 was estimated at 22.3%, compared with 25.0% in 2005 and the SIPRP IV \ntarget of less than 22.0% in 2010. About 71% of the rural population had access to clean water \nin 2007, compared with 62% in 2005 and the SIPRP IV target of 75% in 2010.  \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges in Poverty Reduction \n22.  Despite the tremendous strides Viet Nam has made in eradicating poverty over the last \n15 years, much remains to be done. First, the absolute number of poor people is still quite large, \nalthough their share of the total population has been drastically reduced. In 2006, 5.7 million \npeople suffered from hunger. In 2007, 3.4 million people survived on less than $1.0 (at PPP) per \nday and 28.1 million people lived on less than $2.0 (at PPP) per day (footnote 3). \n \n23.  Second, the incidence of poverty is still fairly high in the rural areas and among ethnic \nminorities, even though it has been decreasing faster than in urban areas and among the ethnic \nmajority. In 2006, the poverty rate was 20.4% in rural areas (compared with 3.9% in urban \nareas) and 52.2% among ethnic minorities (compared with 10.2% among the Kinh and Chinese \nmajority) (footnote 1). The rural areas accounted for 73.3% of the total population but 93.6% of \nthe poor. Ethnic minorities made up only 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the poor.8 \n \n                                                \n7  IMF and IDA. 2006.

Third, the rural poor and poor ethnic minority people not only account for relatively large \nproportions of their respective population groups, but also have significantly lower average \nincomes than the urban poor and poor ethnic majority people, respectively. In 2006, the poverty \ngap was 4.9% in the rural areas and 15.4% among ethnic minorities, compared with 3.2% in the \nurban areas and 2.0% among the Kinh and Chinese majority (footnote 1). \n \n25.  Fourth, the incidence of poverty varies significantly across regions. It is fairly low in the \nSoutheast, Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, and South Central Coast, but quite high in the \nNorthern Mountains (especially the Northwest Mountains), North Central Coast, and Central \nHighlands. In 2006, the poverty rate was 30.2% in the Northern Mountains (49.0% in the \nNorthwest Mountains), 29.1% in the North Central Coast, and 28.6% in the Central Highlands, \ncompared with 5.8% in the Southeast and 8.8% in the Red River Delta.  \n \n26.  Fifth, the vulnerability of the population to poverty is rather high, especially in the urban \nareas. The large difference between the proportion of the population living on less than $2.0 (at \nPPP) a day (32.9% in 2007) and the share of the population living on less than $1.0 (at PPP) a \nday (4.0% in 2007) suggests that the near-poor account for a substantial proportion of the \npopulation. A relatively small external or internal shock and a moderate deterioration in the \neconomic situation can push many of these people into poverty. \n \n27.  Finally,  some  negative  trends  in  poverty  have  emerged  recently.  According  to  the \nhousehold survey data, urban poverty increased somewhat between 2004 and 2006, with the \npoverty rate rising from 3.6% in 2004 to 3.9% in 2006 and the food poverty rate increasing from \n0.8% to 1.2%. Anecdotal evidence suggests that poverty increased further in the urban areas in \n2007 and the first half of 2008 because of high inflation and in particular soaring food prices.9 \n2.  Opportunities Afforded by the Poverty Reduction Support Credit Process \n28.  To meet the remaining challenges of poverty reduction, Viet Nam needs, among other \nthings, to press ahead with the policy reforms that address the structural causes of high inflation \n(such as the relatively low efficiency of public investment and supply-side rigidities), further \nincrease the efficiency of social protection, and foster environmentally sustainable and socially \ninclusive economic growth over the medium term. Some of these reforms are, however, quite \ncomplex. Besides, their costs to the economy as a whole and to the state budget in particular \nare  likely  to  exceed  their  benefits  in  the  short  term.  They  are  therefore  likely  to  put  a \nconsiderable burden on the state budget in the short term. Moreover, they are likely to result in \nnet losses to some economic actors even over the long term. Consequently, some of these \nreforms are likely to meet with resistance from potential losers.  \n \n29.  Strong support from development partners, through the PRSC process, can help the \nGovernment  carry  out  these  reforms.  In  2006,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Network  on \nDevelopment Evaluation of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development, several development agencies and governments \ncommissioned an evaluation study of partnership general budget support (PGBS) operations in \nseven developing countries, including Viet Nam. The study looked into the relevance, efficiency, \nand effectiveness of PGBS (involving several development agencies and the government), such \n                                                \n9  According to one estimate, a 10% rise in food prices in Viet Nam reduces the poverty rate in rural areas by 0.98 \npercentage points, but increases the poverty rate in urban areas by 0.53 percentage points (Vu, Linh, and Paul \nGlewwe. 2008. Impacts of Rising Food Prices on Poverty and Welfare in Vietnam. Paper commissioned by the \nWorld Bank). \n ", "  7 \nas the PRSC process in Viet Nam, and found it to be an efficient, effective, and sustainable way \nof supporting national poverty reduction strategies. PGBS can significantly affect policies and \npolicy processes through financial empowerment, stronger incentives within government, and \nbetter coherence and coordination among international partners. In the countries covered by the \nstudy, PGBS has reinforced collaboration between governments and development agencies \nand improved harmonization of official development assistance. It has helped make public \nfinance  management  more  comprehensive  and  transparent,  increased  pro-poor  public \nexpenditures, and resulted in large savings to the government in transaction costs. The PRSC \nprocess in Viet Nam has had a strong positive impact on policy reforms. It is a successful \nexample of government\u2013donor collaboration, of learning from experience, and of objectives \nmet.10  \n \n30.  Indeed, the PRSC process has been a driving force of policy reforms in Viet Nam in \nrecent years. The Government has ably used the involvement of a large number of development \nagencies (including ADB) in the process to overcome domestic resistance to policy reforms. To \ndeal with such resistance, government agencies advocating certain reform measures have often \nproposed the inclusion of these measures in the policy matrices for the PRSCs.  \n \n31.  According to the World Bank\u2019s report on the implementation and results of PRSCs 1\u20135, \nthe first phase of the PRSC process in Viet Nam (which involved PRSCs 1\u20135 and supported the \nimplementation of CPRGS 2002\u20132006) contributed to the significant progress achieved by the \ncountry  in  transition  to  a  market  economy,  social  inclusion,  and  the  building  of  modern \ngovernance. The PRSC process had a direct influence on the adoption of policy actions that \nwere conducive to higher economic growth and poverty reduction, and helped spread market \nmechanisms, create wage employment, and improve the delivery of public services. The annual \nPRSC cycle with tight deadlines increased incentives to complete key policy actions on time. In \naddition, the PRSC process helped the Government strengthen its capacity to conduct cross-\nsector  policy  dialogue  and  deliver  results  on  time.  Consultations  with  a  large  number  of \ndevelopment  agencies  within  the  framework  of  the  PRSC  process  demonstrated  the \nGovernment the benefits of an open dialogue on key issues and made it more receptive to \nsharing  its  draft  documents  at  an  early  stage  and  eliciting  feedback  from  the  relevant \nstakeholders.11 \n \n32.  According to stakeholder consultations that were held in 2006 as part of an independent \nevaluation of the first phase of the PRSC process, the process was beneficial to policy reforms \nin Viet Nam. The policy dialogue within the framework of the PRSC process was emphasized by \nboth the Government and the participating development agencies as a major benefit of the \nprocess. The Government valued the ideas offered by the development agencies on the design \nand  implementation  of  policy  reforms,  while  the  development  agencies  gained  a  broader \nunderstanding of the direction of the reform process and government thinking. Other PRSC \nbenefits stemmed not only from improving the quality of policies but also from locking in the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  specific  reforms  and  speeding  up  their  implementation.  The \ngeneral budget support provided by participating agencies to Viet Nam within the framework of \n                                                \n10 International Development Department and Associates. 2006.

Rationale for Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction \nProgram V  \n33.  ADB has made a commitment to remain involved in the PRSC process in Viet Nam at \nleast through 2010. Three more SIPRP loans are included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram 2007\u20132010 and country operations business plan 2008\u20132010 for Viet Nam.13 All of \nthem are envisaged as single-tranche standard program loans similar to SIPRPs I\u2013IV. SIPRP V \n(envisaged as a single-tranche standard program loan and included in the 2008 indicative \npipeline) is to provide parallel financing with PRSC 7; SIPRP VI (in the 2009 indicative pipeline), \nwith PRSC 8; and SIPRP VII (2010 indicative pipeline), with PRSC 9. \n \n34.  Combining these three single-tranche operations into a program cluster entitled SIPRP V \nand  comprising  three  chronologically  ordered  subprograms  is  proposed  for  a  number  of \nreasons. First, SIPRPs V\u2013VII are to provide parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs in \nsupport of the implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. More specifically, they are to help the \nGovernment carry out policy reforms that are needed for the successful implementation of \nSEDP  2006\u20132010  but  will  take  several  years  to  complete.  A  program  cluster  with \nchronologically ordered subprograms is more suited to such reforms than a series of standard \nprogram loans each supporting a 1-year program. At the same time, a program cluster permits \nmore flexibility than a multitranche standard program loan in adjusting the policy framework, if \nneeded, to ensure its full consistency with the policy matrices for future PRSCs. \n \n35.  Second,  combining  SIPRPs  V\u2013VI  into  one  program  cluster  will  reaffirm  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment  to  stay  involved  in  the  PRSC  process  through  2010  and  strengthen  ADB\u2019s \npartnership with the Government and other development agencies participating in the PRSC \nprocess. SIPRP V will build on SIPRP IV and help the Government carry out policy reforms \nneeded for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. Subprogram 1 will provide \nparallel financing with PRSC 7, subprogram 2 with PRSC 8, and subprogram 3 with PRSC 9.  \n \n36.  Third, combining SIPRPs V\u2013VII into one program cluster will make more predictable the \namounts of general budget support to be provided by ADB to Viet Nam within the framework of \nthe PRSC process. Medium-term budget planning and external debt management will therefore \nbe easier for the Government.  \n \n37.  Finally, combining SIPRPs V\u2013VII into a program cluster will save staff resources for \nADB. SIPRP V will require less staff time to process than three separate SIPRP loans, primarily \nbecause only one concept paper on the entire program cluster will need to be prepared instead \nof three. Similarly, only one program completion report (PCR) on the entire SIPRP V will need to \nbe prepared after the completion of subprogram 3. The Government\u2019s final report to the National \nAssembly on the implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 can be used in evaluating SIPRP V since \nthe performance targets and indicators of SIPRP V are aligned with those of SEDP 2006\u20132010, \nand SEDP 2006\u20132010 will have been implemented by the time the PCR on SIPRP V is to be \nprepared. \n                                                \n12  Bartholomew, Ann, and Catherine Dom. 2006.

Hence,  combining  SIPRPs  V\u2013VII  into  a  program  cluster  is  consistent  with  the \nrecommendations of the PCR on SIPRP III and the aforementioned evaluation study on general \nbudget support. The PCR on SIPRP III, noting the substantial staff time required to process \nSIPRP loans, recommended the streamlining and simplification of the process.14 The evaluation \nstudy on general budget support concluded that development agencies embarking on PGBS \nshould  be  prepared  for  a  lengthy  engagement.  It  recommended  development  agencies \nproviding such support to Viet Nam within the framework of the PRSC process to make long-\nterm (3\u20135 years) funding commitments and provide schedules of disbursements.  \n \n39.  Unlike SIPRPs I\u2013IV, whose policy matrices were identical to those of the corresponding \nPRSCs, the proposed program cluster will be centered on those actions in the policy matrices \nfor PRSCs 7\u20139 that complement policy actions supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to \nViet Nam or are otherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in the country. SIPRP V will thus be \nmore congruent with ADB\u2019s other operations in Viet Nam.  \n \n40.  With SIPRP V, ADB will stay involved in the PRSC process through 2010, that is, until \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 is fully implemented (Figure 1). ADB can therefore promote, with relatively \nmodest  financing,  a  wide  range  of  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.15 Consequently, the proposed program cluster will help \nADB achieve the objective of its country strategy and program 2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam, which \nis to help the Government reduce the poverty rate to 10%\u201311% by 2010. \n \n41.  Furthermore, continued participation in the PRCS process will provide ADB with another \nmeans of coordinating its activities in Viet Nam with those of other development agencies. \nSIPRP V will help ADB fulfill its obligations under the Rome Declaration on Harmonization \n(2003), the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), and the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid \nEffectiveness (2005). \n                                                \n14  ADB. 2007.

The intended impact of SIPRP V is a continued reduction in poverty in Viet Nam in \n2008\u20132010  and  beyond.  Its  expected  outcome  is  the  successful  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  To  this  end,  the  proposed  program  cluster  will  help  the \nGovernment carry out the policy reforms that are needed for the successful implementation of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 by supporting the policy actions that are critical steps in carrying out the \nreforms  and  are  particularly  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Viet  Nam.  The  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 will not only reduce poverty during 2006\u20132010 but will also \nincrease Viet Nam\u2019s economic competitiveness and strengthen the foundations for sustainable \nand inclusive growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. The Government\u2019s \nDevelopment Policy Letter is in Appendix 3. \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n43.  The Vietnam Development Report 2007 provides the analytical basis for the second \nphase of the PRSC process (which involves the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs 6\u20139 and supports the \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010) and the proposed program cluster. The report was jointly \nprepared by 16 development agencies, including ADB, in 2006. It analyzes the medium-term \ndevelopment  challenges  facing  Viet  Nam  and  reviews  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  for \novercoming these challenges, as set out in SEDP 2006\u20132010.16 It also identifies the policy \nreforms that are needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and proposes \nspecific policy actions to advance these reforms.  \n \n44.  The policy actions proposed by the Vietnam Development Report 2007 fall into the \nfollowing four broad reform areas: \n \n(i)  Business  development.  Equitizing  or  restructuring  SOEs,  developing  the \nfinancial and private sectors, improving the quality of infrastructure services, and \ndeepening Viet Nam\u2019s integration into the global economy.  \n(ii)  Social inclusion. Improving the quality of health care and education and access \nto these services, strengthening social protection, and promoting gender equality.  \n(iii)  National  resource  management.  Strengthening  the  management  of  natural \nresources  (including  water,  land,  and  forests)  and  the  protection  of  the \nenvironment.  \n(iv)  Governance.  Improving  planning  processes,  strengthening  public  financial \nmanagement and pubic administration, reducing corruption, and improving legal \ntransparency and accessibility.  \n \n45.  Some of the actions proposed in the Vietnam Development Report 2007 were included \nin the policy matrices for PRSC 6 and SIPRP IV. The remaining actions served as a starting \npoint in the selection of actions to be included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7.  \n \n                                                \n16 World Bank. 2006. Vietnam Development Report 2007: Aiming High. Joint donor report to the Vietnam Consultative \nGroup Meeting, Hanoi, 14\u201315 December 2006. \n ", "12 \n46.  The initial list of policy actions for PRSC 7 was discussed and agreed on in 2007 by the \ndevelopment agencies participating in the PRSC process and the Government.17 In January\u2013\nMarch 2008, the development agencies held two rounds of consultations with the Government \non the status of that initial list. On the basis of those discussions, the list was slightly modified. \nWhen the World Bank conducted the appraisal and the negotiations for PRSC 7 in May 2008, \nthe development agencies and the Government agreed on the final list of 38 policy actions, \ndown from the original 61.18 ADB took part in all of these consultations and provided substantive \ninputs to the policy matrix for PRSC 7.  \n \n47.  The actions covered by subprogram 1 of the proposed program cluster were selected, \nthrough consultation among various units of ADB and with the Government, from the final list of \nactions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7. The tentative policy actions for subprograms 2 \nand 3 were drawn from the tentative list of policy actions for PRSCs 8\u20139. Only those actions that \ncomplemented policy actions supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam and did not \nduplicate those actions, or were otherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam, were \nselected. All actions selected for subprogram 1 were completed by October 2008. The following \nis a brief description of these actions and their relationships with the tentative actions under \nsubprograms 2 and 3 and ADB\u2019s other operations in Viet Nam.19  \n1.  Business Development \n48.  Action 1: Assess the scope and nature of lending and other transactions among \naffiliated parties within economic groups and general corporations. There is concern that \nthe involvement of large SOEs in the financial sector, through their control of commercial banks \nand other financial institutions, could undermine the efficient allocation of capital and be a \nsource of instability in the medium term. Investments by large SOEs in real estate and the stock \nmarket probably fueled the recent stock market and real estate bubbles. As a first step toward \nregulating these activities, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has assessed the scope of related \nlending and related party transactions and their implications for economic stability and overall \nefficiency. MOF reviewed outside investments by economic groups and general corporations, \nassessed the conditions under which they borrow from the banks they have invested in, and \nevaluated the extent and pricing of sales among affiliates.20 This assessment will be useful in \ndesigning the SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Facility, a program loan in ADB\u2019s 2009 \nindicative lending pipeline for Viet Nam that is intended to facilitate the reform of SOEs and \nimprove corporate governance at these enterprises. \n \n                                                \n17 The experience with previous PRSCs showed that policy reforms tend to make slower progress in areas where   \npolitical will is limited, institutional responsibilities overlap, or analysis is insufficient. This finding was taken into \naccount when the initial list of policy actions for PRSC 7 was drawn up. An action, though deemed relatively \nambitious, was included in the list if the political will to carry it out was believed to be strong and the action was \nsupported by sound analysis and fell within the area of responsibility of a single government agency. If political will \nfor the action was deemed to be limited or the analytical basis was weak or the action was a responsibility held in \ncommon by several government agencies, a less ambitious alternative was chosen. \n18  The final list of actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 is in Appendix 4.  \n19 The policy matrix and the objective tree for SIPRP V, which are given in Appendix 5, show graphically how the \npolicy actions covered by subprogram 1 and the tentative policy actions under subprograms 2 and 3 are \ninterrelated and how they will contribute to the outputs, outcome and impact of SIPRP V. The status of the actions \ncovered by subprogram 1 is described in Appendix 6.   \n20  World Bank. 2008. International Development Association Program Document for a Proposed Credit in the Amount \nof SDR92.1 Million (US$150.0 Million Equivalent) to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for a Seventh Poverty \nReduction Support Operation. Washington, DC (Report No. 42896-VN). \n ", "  13 \n49.  The assessment will also be useful in carrying out action 1 (strengthen the financial \nmanagement  of  SOEs  and  their  investment  in  other  entities,  defining  the  level  of  such \ninvestments) under subprograms 2 and 3. Action 1 under subprogram 1 and actions 1 and 2 \n(transfer state ownership rights in equitized SOEs to the State Capital Investment Corporation) \nunder subprograms 2 and 3 will help equitize or restructure SOEs, thereby contributing to \nbusiness development and the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n50.  Action  2:  Approve  equitization  plans,  allowing  the  participation  of  strategic \ninvestors, for two state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and complete the equitization \nof one of them. The equitization of SOCBs is an important part of market-oriented reforms in \nViet Nam. By Prime Minister\u2019s Decisions 1289/QD-TTg of 26 September 2007 and 313/QD-TTg \nof  24  March  2008,  the  Government  approved  the  equitization  plans  for  Vietcombank  and \nMekong Housing Bank, respectively. Both plans provide for an initial public offering and the first \ngeneral meeting of shareholders.  \n \n51.  The equitization of Vietcombank has essentially been completed. The bank held an \ninitial public offering in December 2007 and its first general meeting of shareholders in April \n2008. However, the sale of the bank\u2019s shares to strategic investors and its listing on a stock \nexchange have been postponed in view of unfavorable market conditions. \n \n52.  Action  3:  Issue  a  road  map  to  ehnace  bank  supervision,  including  off-site \nsupervision and risk management tools. Viet Nam\u2019s banking system has expanded rapidly \nsince the 1990s, both in number of banks and in size of credit portfolio. Numerous joint-stock \nbanks with relatively small capital have been established and have quickly built up their credit \nportfolios, often with inadequate regard for quality. SOCB lending to SOEs has been extensive \nbut not always commercially viable. Many banks have excessive exposure to the stock and real \nestate markets. Now that stock prices have fallen from their record highs in 2007, the real estate \nmarket has cooled, interest rates have risen, and economic growth is slowing down, serious \nvulnerabilities have emerged in the banking system. Although reliable data on nonperforming \nloans are not available, one can assume with a reasonable degreee of confidence that the \nshare of these loans in banks\u2019 portfolios has increased significantly in the last several months \nand is likely to increase further in the months ahead. It is therefore particularly encouraging that, \non 24 August 2007, the SBV governor issued Decision 1976/QD-NHNN approving a proposal \nfor  the  organizational  and  operational  reform  of  banking  supervision,  including  off-site \nsupervision and risk management tools. The proposal is in effect a road map for strengthening \nrisk management at commercial banks and their prudential supervision by SBV. On 31 January \n2008, SBV adopted Plan 1094/KH-NHNN implementing this proposal. \n \n53.  Action 3 (complete the equitization of four SOCBs, with the participation of strategic \ninvestors) under subprograms 2 and 3 will be a continuation of action 1 under subprogram 1. \nThese two actions\u2014together with action 4 (certify the internal credit rating system of all banks \nand approve inspection manuals) and action 5 (prepare a revised law on the central bank \nfocusing its mandate on, and enhancing its autonomy in regard to, monetary policy and financial \nsector stability) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will complement policy actions and reforms under \nsubprogram 1 of the Third Financial Sector Program Loan (approved in November 2007)21 and \nthe technical assistance (TA) for Support for Developing Capital Markets and Building Capacity \n                                                \n21  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "14 \nin  the  Financial  Sector  (approved  in  June  2008).22 The  actions  will  contribute to  business \ndevelopment and poverty reduction through a sound banking system and a better-developed \nfinancial sector.  \n \n54.  Action 4: Rationalize incentives related to the enterprise income tax and simplify \ntax procedures for household businesses. Household businesses in Viet Nam now pay the \ncorporate income tax (CIT). In November 2007, the National Assembly passed the Law on \nPersonal Income Tax, under which income from household businesses can be declared and \ntaxed as individual income. The law also unified the tax rates for Vietnamese and foreigners and \nreduced the maximum rate from 40% to 35%. As regards the CIT, in November 2007, MOF \nissued Circular 134/2007/TT-BTC with a positive list (deductible items) and a negative list \n(nondeductible items). The revised Law on Corporate Income Tax, lowering the base rate of the \nCIT from 28% to 25% and imposing time restrictions on many exemptions and preferential rates, \nwas passed by the National Assembly in June 2008 and is to take effect on 1 January 2009. \n \n55.  Action 5: Raise the cap on shareholdings by a single foreign investor in unlisted \ncompanies. Restrictions on foreign ownership of local companies present a serious barrier to \ninflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment into Viet Nam. There is a 49% ceiling on foreign \nownership of listed nonfinancial companies. There is also a 15% cap on the share of a single \nstrategic foreign investor in the capital of a local joint-stock bank; this cap can be raised to 20% \nby  Prime  Minister\u2019s  decision,  depending  on  the  case.  But  while  a  single  strategic  foreign \ninvestor may hold up to 20% of the shares of a local joint-stock bank, the combined share of all \nforeign investors cannot exceed 30%. Until recently, the share of foreign investors in the capital \nof many other types of companies, including equitized but still unlisted SOEs, could not exceed \n30%. The Government\u2019s Decree 139/2007/ND-CP of September 2007 on the implementation of \nthe  Enterprise  Law  effectively  abolished  the  30%  cap  on  foreign  ownership  of  unlisted \ncompanies (other than those that are subject to sector-specific restrictions on private or foreign \nownership). \n \n56.  Actions  4  and  5  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  6  (establish  a  national \nbusiness registry with a unique number for business, tax, statistics, and seal agencies), action 7 \n(adopt guidelines to govern the operations of the Viet Nam Competition Council), and action 8 \n(revise the legal framework for the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and enable \nbetter links with large-scale industries) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will complement actions \nand  initiatives  supported  by  subprogram  2  of  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  (SME) \nDevelopment Program Loan (approved in December 2006)23 and phase 2 of the TA for Making \nMarkets Work Better for the Poor (approved in February 2008).24 The actions will contribute to \nbusiness development and the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 by promoting \nprivate sector development.  \n \n57.  Action  6:  Separate  power  transmission  and  generation  assets  and  regroup \ntransmission assets under a single National Power Transmission Corporation. The rapidly \ngrowing demand for electricity is among the most pressing infrastructure challenges facing \nViet Nam. To ensure that electricity prices stay affordable while attracting private investment \n                                                \n22  ADB. 2008.

In a crucial step toward \nthe  creation  of  such  a  market,  power  transmission  and  generation  assets  were  recently \nseparated  and  transmission  assets  grouped  under  the  National  Power  Transmission \nCorporation,  which  started  operating  on  1  July  2008. The  company  is  responsible for the \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of Viet Nam\u2019s power transmission network comprising \n220 kilovolt (kV) and 500 kV lines and substations. The separation of power transmission and \ngeneration assets and the establishment of the National Power Transmission Corporation have \npaved the way for the consolidation and equitization of generation assets and the creation of a \nwholesale market for electricity. \n \n58.  Action  6  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  9  (adopt  a  pricing  system  for \nelectricity from renewable energy and provide incentives for the procurement of energy-efficient \nequipment by the Government) and action 10 (adopt user charges designed to better manage \ndemand for infrastructure services) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will help improve the quality of \ninfrastructure services. The actions will complement ADB\u2019s numerous ongoing and planned \nenergy and other infrastructure projects in Viet Nam and contribute to business development, \neconomic growth, and poverty reduction.  \n \n59.  Action 11 (complete the legal framework enabling the improved provision of logistics \nservices, including multimodal transport) and action 12 (issue a time-bound action plan for the \nimplementation of commitments to the WTO) under subprograms 2 and 3 will help Viet Nam \nintegrate itself more deeply with the global economy, expand trade, reap the benefits of WTO \nmembership, and mitigate its adverse effects. The actions will thereby contribute to business \ndevelopment and the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. \n2.  Social Inclusion \n60.  Action 7: Increase the health insurance premium paid on behalf of the poor and \npartially  subsidize  the  near-poor.  In  October  2002,  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision \n139/2002/QD-TTg introduced a government contribution of D50,000 per person per year toward \nhealth insurance of the poor. The amount of the contribution was raised to D60,000 in 2006, \nD80,000  in  2007,  and  D130,000  in  2008.  The  Government  is  now  considering  setting  its \ncontribution at 3.0% of the minimum wage; this will increase the amount of the contribution \nfurther  (given  the  current  minimum  wage  of  D540,000  per  month).  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nDecision 289/2008/QD-TTg of March 2008 allowed the near-poor to join the voluntary health \ninsurance  program,  with  the  Government  contributing  50%  of  their  insurance  premium.  In \nSeptember 2008, the Ministry of Health and MOF issued interministerial circular 10/2008/TTLT-\nBYT-BTC,  which  specified  the mechanism for the Government\u2019s  50%  contribution  towards \nhealth insurance of the near-poor. \n \n61.  Action  7  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  13  (adopt  standards  for  the \ncertification of health care practitioners and the classification of private health facilities) and \naction  14  (establish  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks  for  the  monitoring  of  the \nperformance of health care providers) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will improve the quality of \nhealth  care  services  and  access  to  such  services.  The  actions  will  complement  the  ADB \nprojects Health Care in the Central Highlands (approved in January 2004 and intended to \nimprove the availability of good-quality health care services in five provinces in the Central \nHighlands)25 and Health Care in the South Central Coast Region (approved on 7 November \n                                                \n25  ADB. 2004.

The actions will \nalso improve starting conditions for the Secondary Education Sector Development Program \n(which is in the indicative pipeline for 2009 and is intended to improve secondary education \nlearning  outcomes).  Action  7  under  subprogram  1  as  well  as  actions  13\u201316  under \nsubprograms 2 and 3 will contribute to the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 by \nmaking economic growth more socially inclusive.  \n3.  Natural Resource Management \n63.  Action  8:  Allocate  institutional  responsibilities  for  integrated  river  basin \nmanagement. Until recently, river basin management was carried out by both the Ministry of \nNatural  Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE)  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment  (MARD).  This  arrangement  significantly  complicated  integrated  river  basin \nmanagement  and  compromised  its  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  In  January  2008,  the \nGovernment issued Decree 01/2008/ND-CP spelling out the functions and tasks of MARD. \nRiver  basin  management  was  not  among  the  functions.  On  the  other  hand, \nDecree 25/2008/ND-CP, issued by the Government in March 2008, listed integrated river basin \nmanagement  among  the  key  functions  of  MONRE  and  authorized  the  latter  to  represent \nViet Nam in the Mekong River Council. \n \n64.  Action 8 implemented a key recommendation of the draft final report of the Water Sector \nReview Project,27 an ongoing TA project. By doing so, it settled a policy issue that adversely \naffected many water management projects of ADB, including Central Region Water Resources \n(approved  in  December  2005  and  aimed  at  strengthening  irrigation  management  in  six \nprovinces in the central region of Viet Nam)28 and Central Region Small and Medium Town \nDevelopment (approved in November 2006 and intended to improve water supply services in \neight small and medium-sized towns in the central region).29  \n \n65.  Action  8  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  17  (restructure  irrigation \nmanagement  companies  to  improve  their  service  orientation  and  financial  viability)  and \naction 18 (develop a unified national sanitation strategy and encourage greater participation by \ncommunes and the private sector in sanitation) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will improve the \nmanagement of water resources. Action 19 (approve a national target program for adapting to \nthe  climate  change  and  allocate  institutional  responsibilities  for  its  implementation)  and \naction 20 (establish national and regional pollution monitoring systems to enable results-based \nenvironmental planning) will enhance environmental protection. All these actions will contribute \nto the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 by strengthening management of natural \nresources.  \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2008.

As part of the modernization of planning processes in \nViet Nam, further progress has recently been made in developing a monitoring framework for \nSEDPs. In May 2007, the Ministry of Planning and Investment approved, through Decision \n555/2007/QD-BKH, a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework for SEDP 2006\u20132010. \nThe framework specifies the monitoring indicators and the agencies responsible for reporting on \nindividual indicators. ADB assisted the ministry in developing the framework through the TA \nproject Results-Based Monitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth (approved in July 2005).30   \n \n67.  Action 9 under subprogram 1\u2014together with action 21 (establish a legal framework for \nstrengthening urban planning and urban infrastructure management) and action 22 (integrate \nsector policies and national target programs at the commune level, emphasizing participation at \nall stages) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will help improve planning processes. The actions will \ncontribute to the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 by improving governance.  \n \n68.  Action 10: Issue regulations on the contents and timing of disclosure of State \nAudit of Viet Nam (SAV) reports, including reports on audits of individual entities. SAV \nwas established in 2004 as an independent institution reporting to the National Assembly, which \nwas  empowered  to  appoint  and  dismiss  the  Auditor  General.  In  July  2007,  SAV  issued \nDecision 03/2007/QD-KTNN  mandating  the  disclosure  of  its  audit  findings  and \nrecommendations. Three types of SAV documents must be disclosed: (i) annual audit reports, \n(ii) reports on the implementation of audit conclusions and recommendations, (iii) and the audit \nreports  and  the  audit  minutes  pertaining  to  audits  of  individual  entities.  This  regulation \nadequately defines the responsibilities for disclosure, the reports to be disclosed, and the timing \nand means of disclosure. Since the issuance of the decision, SAV\u2019s audit reports have been \ndistributed to members of the National Assembly, press conferences have been held on the \nconclusions and recommendations of several of the reports, and various individual audits have \nbeen posted on SAV\u2019s website. \n \n69.  Action  10  under  subprogram  10\u2014together  with  action  23  (formulate  a  public  debt \nmanagement law consolidating the management of domestic and external debt) and action 24 \n(adopt public sector financial reporting standards in line with international standards) under \nsubprograms  2  and  3\u2014will  help  improve  governance  and  contribute  to  the  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 by strengthening public financial management. The actions \nwill complement the activities under the aforementioned TA projects Support for Developing \nCapital Markets and Building Capacity in the Financial Sector (footnote 22) and Results-Based \nMonitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth (footnote 30), as well as the TA project Supporting \nFinancial Management Decentralization (approved in December 2007).31  \n \n70.  Action 11: Extend the \u201cone-stop shop\u201d (OSS) mechanism to all ministries and \nagencies and introduce an interlinked OSS mechanism to further simplify administrative \nprocedures. As part of the Government\u2019s efforts to simplify administrative procedures and \nimprove  the  business  environment,  the  Prime  Minister  in  June  2007  issued  Decision \n93/2007/QD-TTg requiring all local public service agencies to introduce an OSS mechanism or \nan interagency OSS mechanism.

These actions will \ncomplement the activities under the TA project Supporting Civil Service Reform (approved in \nAugust 2008 and expected to develop an integrated civil service reform policy framework).32 \nAction 11 under subprogram 11 will also help improve the business environment in Viet Nam \nand thus complement policy actions and initiatives supported by subprogram 2 of the SME \nDevelopment Program Loan (footnote 23) and phase 2 of the TA for Making Markets Work \nBetter for the Poor (footnote 24). \n \n72.  Action  12:  Implement  the  asset  declaration  requirement  in  regard  to  senior \nofficials  and  their  immediate  families,  with  penalties  for  noncompliance.  The  asset \ndeclaration requirement was introduced by the Anti-Corruption Law of 2006 and regulated \nthrough Decree 37/2007/ND-CP of 9 March 2007, which laid down disciplinary measures for \nnoncompliance. To implement the law and the decree, the Government Inspectorate issued \nCircular 2442/TT-TTCP of 13 November 2007 providing detailed practical guidelines for the \ndeclaration process, and Official Letter 533/CCTN-TTCP of 2 April 2008 setting out a standard \ntemplate for reporting by ministries, agencies, and provinces. Extensive training was conducted \nat the end of 2007 and government employees were asked to submit their asset declarations by \nFebruary 2008. Compliance has been high. Verification is based on denunciations. Action 12 \nunder  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  27  (prepare  a  revised  press  law  to  encourage \naccurate,  objective,  and  responsible  reporting  on  corruption)  and  action  28  (adopt  a \ncomprehensive anticorruption strategy) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will help reduce corruption \nand improve governance. \nC.  Important Features \n73.  As  indicated  above,  the  proposed  program  cluster  will,  in  some  respects,  be  a \ncontinuation  of  SIPRPs  I\u2013IV.  Like  the  latter,  it  will  support  the  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction program by providing parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s \nPRSCs. It will build on SIPRP IV to help the Government carry out policy reforms needed for the \nsuccessful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n74.  Unlike SIPRPs I\u2013IV, however, SIPRP V will take the program cluster approach. Its \nimplementation period (3 years) will be shorter than the usual implementation period of program \nclusters (4\u20137 years). The program cluster approach is nonetheless warranted because all three \nsubprograms  of  SIPRP  V  will  support\u2014within  the  framework  of  the  PRSC  process\u2014the \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n75.  Subprogram 1 will provide parallel financing with PRSC 7, which was approved by the \nWorld Bank on 25 June 2008. The Government, the World Bank, ADB, and other development \nagencies participating in the PRSC process agreed on the policy matrix for PRSC 7 through a \nseries of consultations held in 2007 and the first half of 2008. The matrix encompasses a wide \n                                                \n32 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Supporting Civil Service Reform. Manila. \n ", "  19 \nrange  of  policy  actions  in  business  development,  social  inclusion,  natural  resource \nmanagement, and governance.  \n \n76.  Subprogram 1 will include only those actions in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 that are \nparticularly relevant to ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam. These actions were chosen through \nconsultations  among  various  units  of  ADB  and  with  the  Government.  All  of  them  were \ncompleted by October 2008. Therefore, loan effectiveness will be the only condition for the \nrelease of the loan tranche for subprogram 1. \n \n77.  Likewise, loans for subprograms 2 and 3 will be proposed to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \nafter  the  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs  8  and  9  and  covered  by \nsubprograms 2 and 3, respectively, of SIPRP V are completed. This means that when the Board \nof Directors deliberates on subprograms 2 and 3 of SIPRP V, there will be no pending policy \nactions under the subprogram concerned. Loan effectiveness will be the only condition for the \ntranche release. \n \n78.  The design of the proposed program cluster takes into account the findings of the 2001 \nand 2007 studies on program lending of the Operations Evaluation Department. The 2001 study \nexpressed concerns about the complicated policy matrices and the excessive use of conditions \nthat adversely affect program performance.33 The 2007 study identified factors affecting the \nrelevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of the impact, outcomes, and outputs of program loans. \nThe factors that promote the achievement of the desired results and are within ADB\u2019s control \nare (i) consistency of reform outcomes with the government reform agenda and priorities, \n(ii) sufficient analysis and dialogue, and (iii) focused and manageable conditions that were acted \nupon before program start-up. The factors that impede the achievement of the desired results \nbut are within ADB\u2019s control are (i) overly complex designs with too many tranche release \nconditions  specified  in the  policy  matrix,  and (ii)  deferment  of  conditions  to  later tranches \n(footnote 15). \n \n79.  Although SIPRP V will cover only those actions in the policy matrices for PRSCs 7\u20139 \nthat are particularly relevant to ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam, it will still have a fairly broad \nscope. The reason is that, as mentioned above, a sustained reduction in poverty requires \ncontinued and balanced progress in policy reforms in many areas. Consequently, the policy \nmatrix for PRSC 7 includes, and the policy matrices for PRSCs 8 and 9 are likely to include, \nactions in many different areas. Besides, ADB is active in many sectors in Viet Nam, and policy \nreforms in these sectors are of particular relevance to its operations. \n \n80.  At the same time, there will be only limited continuity in the policy actions supported by \nthe various subprograms of SIPRP V. This is because the policy matrix for PRSC 7 includes \nonly  those  actions  that  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC  process  and  the \nGovernment considered to be critical steps in the reform process in particular areas in 2007 and \nthe first half of 2008 and for which the Government needed the combined support of many \ndevelopment agencies. Actions for PRSCs 8 and 9 will be selected on the basis of the same \ncriteria and will not necessarily continue actions included in the policy matrix for the previous \nPRSC.  \n                                                \n33  ADB. 2001. Special Evaluation Study on Program Lending. Manila. http://www.adb.org/Documents/PERs/sst-stu-\n2001-16/ses-program-lending.asp \n ", "20 \nD.  Financing Plan \n81.  Some of the actions included in the subprogram 1 of SIPRP V entail substantial costs to \nViet Nam\u2019s state budget. So do some of the actions that are part of the policy matrix for PRSC 7 \nbut are not covered by subprogram 1 of the proposed program cluster. For example, the \nincrease in the health insurance premium paid on behalf of  the poor and the partial subsidies to \nthe near-poor will cost the budget an estimated $47 million in 2008 and about $130 million in \n2009. The total cost to the state budget in 2008 and 2009 of the actions included in the policy \nmatrix for PRSC 7 is estimated at $450 million.  \n \n82.  It is proposed that a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n16,439,000 be provided for subprogram 1 of SIPRP V from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \nThe loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of \n1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% during the amortization period; and other terms and \nconditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The World Bank has already approved PRSC 7 in \nthe  amount  of  $150  million  from  IDA  and  more  than  10  other  development  agencies  are \nexpected to provide grants or concessional loans totaling about $175 million as cofinancing or \nparallel financing with PRSC 7 (Appendix 7). The remaining cost to the budget of the actions \nincluded in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 will be covered by the Government of Viet Nam. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Executing Agency \n83.  SBV will be the Executing Agency for the proposed program cluster and have the overall \nresponsibility for the implementation of all its subprograms. SBV hosts the PRSC coordination \nunit, which facilitates interactions between the Government and development agencies within \nthe framework of the PRSC process. SBV was also the Executing Agency for SIPRPs I\u2013IV.  \n \n84.  The government agencies represented at the National Steering Committee on the PRSC \nprocess  will  be  implementing  agencies  for  the  proposed  program  cluster.34 They  will  be \nresponsible for carrying out the actions included in the policy matrix of the program cluster and \nwill provide updates on the status of these actions to the PRSC coordination unit of SBV. \n2.  Implementation Period \n85.  The  proposed  program  cluster  will  be  implemented  from  1  January  2009  to \n31 December 2011. Subprogram 1 will be implemented from 1 January to 31 December 2009, \nsubprogram 2 from 1 January to 31 December 2010, and subprogram 3 from 1 January to \n31 December 2011.  \n3.  Disbursement and Procurement \n86.  Since all actions included in subprogram 1 have been completed the proposed loan will \nbe disbursed in a single tranche when the loan is declared effective. The loan proceeds will be \nused to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \n                                                \n34 The National Steering Committee on the PRSC process was set up in May 2002. It consists of representative of \ngovernment agencies responsible for policies and sectors covered by the PRSC process. The deputy prime \nminister in charge of economic reforms chairs the Committee, and a deputy governor of SBV is its standing vice \nchairperson.     \n ", "  21 \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  the  ineligible  items  listed  in \nAppendix 8 and imports financed from other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \n87.  As provided in ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and requirements for program \nloans,35 the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as the \nBorrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, provided that the value of \nViet Nam\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is at least equal to the amount of \nthe loan to be disbursed. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with its \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy \nof the Borrower\u2019s certification. As such, the procedures for procurement and disbursement of \nfunds, and the use of counterpart funds, are felt to be satisfactory. \n4.  Anticorruption \n88.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to SIPRP V. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the relevant loan regulations.  \n \n89.  The  Government  has  taken  an  active  approach  to  fighting  corruption,  and  recently \nadopted  several  legal  documents  against  corruption,  including  the  Anti-Corruption  Law.  A \nnational steering committee against corruption, headed by the Prime Minister, has been set up. \nThe committee, which has the power to suspend officials suspected of wrongdoing, is already \nengaged in several high-profile investigations. Substantial funds have been allocated from the \nstate budget to anticorruption activities, and results of investigations into corruption overseen by \nthe Government Inspectorate have been disclosed. \n5.  Loans for Subprograms 2 and 3 \n90.  After the development agencies participating in the PRSC process and the Government \nagree on the final list of policy actions for PRSC 8, the actions to be covered by subprogram 2 \nof SIPRP V will be separated from those to be covered by subprogram 3. If necessary, the \nactions under subprogram 2 will be adjusted and made fully consistent with the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8. A loan for subprogram 2 will be proposed to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2009 after the \npolicy actions to be covered by this subprogram are completed. After the development agencies \nparticipating in the PRSC process and the Government agree on the final list of policy actions \nfor PRSC 9, the policy actions under subprogram 3 will be adjusted, if needed, to ensure their \nfull consistency with the policy matrix for PRSC 9. A loan for subprogram 3 will be proposed to \nthe Board of Directors in 2010 after the policy actions to be covered by this subprogram are \ncompleted.  \n \n91.  The tentative amounts and terms of the loans for subprograms 2 and 3 will be the same \nas those of the loan for subprogram 1. Hence, the tentative total amount of the proposed \nprogram  cluster  will  be  $75.0  million. The  loans for  subprograms  2 and  3 (including  their \namounts and terms) are, however, subject to separate approval by the Board of Directors. \n                                                \n35  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "22 \n6.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n92.  Progress in the implementation of SIPRP V will be assessed in 2009 and 2010 in \nconjunction  with  the  processing  of  loans  for  its  subprograms  2  and  3,  respectively.  The \nassessments will be included in the loan documents for subprograms 2 and 3. A PCR for the \nentire program cluster will be prepared after the completion of subprogram 3.  \n \n93.  Data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of SIPRP V will be obtained from (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s annual reports to the National Assembly on the implementation of SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010,  (ii)  electronic  and  paper  publications  of  the  relevant  government  agencies,  (iii) the \nrelevant  government  agencies  through  the  PRSC  coordination  unit  of  SBV,  and (iv)  other \nsources indicated in the design and monitoring framework.  \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Benefits \n94.  The policy reforms that the proposed program cluster will support will yield considerable \neconomic benefits to Viet Nam and substantial financial benefits to the Government. They will \nraise the living standards of the Vietnamese people by fostering environmentally sustainable \nand socially inclusive economic growth. The reforms will also increase budget revenue by \nexpanding  the  tax  base,  and  reduce  budget  expenditure  by  improving  public  financial \nmanagement. Over the medium term, the financial benefits of these reforms to the Government \nare likely to exceed their costs (including interest to be paid on loans received from various \ndevelopment agencies within the framework of the PRSC process). \nB.  Social Impact \n95.  A detailed poverty and social impact assessment of subprogram 1 of SIPRP V has been \nprepared in accordance with (i) ADB\u2019s Operations Manual section on the incorporation of social \ndimensions into ADB operations,36 and (ii) the handbook on social analysis issued in November \n2007 by ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department and Strategy and Policy \nDepartment. In particular, the social implications of the actions covered by the subprogram \n(including their indigenous people, involuntary resettlement, and gender implications) have been \nreviewed. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is given in Appendix 9. \n \n96.  The  conclusion  is  that  the  policy  actions  included  in  the  policy  framework  for \nsubprogram 1 of SIPRP V will have significant social effects. In particular, they will help reduce \npoverty in Viet Nam not only by fostering environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive \neconomic growth, but also by increasing social assistance to the poor and the near-poor. The \npoor will directly benefit from the increases in the health insurance premium paid on their behalf \nby the Government. The near-poor will directly benefit from government subsidies for their \nhealth insurance premiums. Ethnic minorities will benefit more than the ethnic majority from the \nactions  included  in  the  policy  framework  of  subprogram  1  because  poverty  incidence  is \nsignificantly higher among ethnic minorities than among the ethnic majority. Yet, none of the \nactions included in the policy framework of subprogram 1 is centered on ethnic minorities or has \nan  adverse  impact  on  ethnic  minorities.  The  subprogram  has  therefore  been  assigned  to \nindigenous people category C.  \n                                                \n36  ADB. 2007. Operations Manual. Section C3: Incorporation of Social Dimensions into ADB Operations. Manila \n(25 April). \n ", "  23 \n \n97.  The proposed program cluster will not have an investment component and the actions \nincluded in the policy framework of its subprogram 1 will not cause any involuntary resettlement. \nTherefore, the subprogram has been assigned to involuntary resettlement category C. It has no \nsignificant gender implication.  \nC.  Environmental Impact \n98.  Subprogram  1  of  SIPRP  V  has  been  assigned  to  environmental  category  C.  Its \nenvironmental implications have been reviewed and a matrix of potential environmental impact \nhas been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental policy. The matrix is in Appendix 9. \n \n99.  The review of the environmental implications of subprogram 1 concluded that several of \nthe actions included in the policy framework for this subprogram are likely to have at least minor \npositive  environmental  impact.  The  policy  action  related  to  the  clarification  of  institutional \nresponsibilities for integrated river basin management, for one, is likely to have a major positive \nimpact,  while  the  policy  actions  concerning  the  management  of  power  transmission \ninfrastructure  and  the  improvement  of  SEDP  monitoring  systems  are  likely  to  have  minor \npositive  impact.  Enhancement  measures  have  been  developed  to  optimize  the  expected \npositive impact. No action has been identified as likely to have a negative environmental impact. \nAccordingly,  no  further  environmental  assessment  of  subprogram  1  is  warranted  and  no \nenvironmental impact assessment is required. \n \n100.  A preliminary analysis of the potential cumulative environmental impact of the policy \nactions to be supported by subprogram 1 and the tentative policy actions to be supported by \nsubprograms 2 and 3 concluded that the impact is likely to be positive. The environmental \nimplications of subprograms 2 and 3 will be assessed in detail in 2009 and 2010, respectively, \nafter the policy matrices for PRSC 8 and 9 are finalized and the policy actions to be supported \nby subprograms 2 and 3 of SIPRP V are confirmed.  \nD.  Assumptions and Risks \n101.  The proposed program cluster will support policy actions that constitute critical steps in \nthe policy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and are \nparticularly relevant to ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam. The reforms, however, need to be fully \ncarried out if SEDP 2006\u20132010 is to be successfully implemented. Therefore, it is assumed that, \nafter completing the policy actions covered by SIPRP V and the other actions included in the \npolicy matrices for the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs 7\u20139, the Government will follow through with the \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 on its own or with \nthe  support  of  development  agencies  under  other  projects.  It  is  further  assumed  that  the \ninvestment projects that are included in SEDP 2006\u20132010 and necessary for attaining its targets \nand goals will be implemented on schedule.  \n \n102.  These assumptions are based on the Government\u2019s commitment to carry out the policy \nreforms and implement the investment projects that are needed to achieve the targets and goals \nof  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Furthermore,  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  are  now  or  will  be  supported  by  ADB  through  other \npolicy-based loans to Viet Nam (such as the financial sector program loans and the small and \nmedium-sized enterprise development loans) and by other development agencies both within \nand outside the framework of the PRSC process. \n \n ", "24 \n103.  There is a risk that high inflation will persist long enough to preclude the successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and, in particular, the achievement of its poverty reduction \ntarget. There is also a risk that the ongoing global financial crisis and economic slowdown \ncombined with the macroeconomic stabilization measures recently taken by the Government will \nslacken growth in Viet Nam to a degree that will render some of the targets and goals of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 (including the target related to the poverty rate) impossible to attain. \n \n104.  However, as mentioned above, the macroeconomic situation in Viet Nam has started to \nimprove. Monthly inflation decelerated significantly in June\u2013September 2008, and there was \ndeflation in October 2008. As a result, year-on-year inflation fell in September-October 2008. At \nthe same time, economic growth slowed down only moderately and remained quite high by \ninternational  standards.  In  the  baseline  scenario  of  the  Asian  Development  Outlook  2008 \nUpdate, real GDP is projected to grow by 6.5% in 2007 and 6.0% in 2008. Period-average \ninflation is forecast to decline from 25.0% in 2008 to 17.5% in 2009.37 Moreover, Viet Nam\u2019s \nmedium- to long-term economic prospects remain good. Hence, the risks that SEDP 2006\u20132010 \nwill not be successfully implemented and the expected outcome of the proposed program \ncluster will not be attained are rather small. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n105.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The actions included in the policy framework of subprogram 1 of SIPRP V and \nspecified in the Development Policy Letter will continue to be in effect during the \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010; and \n(ii)  Adequate and timely counterpart funds for carrying out these actions will be \nmade available. \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n106.  I am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and loan would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the program cluster to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Support for the \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program V; and \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,439,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of the Support for the \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program V from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n14 November 2008 \n                                                \n37  ADB. 2008.

Poverty Reduction in Viet Nam \n1.  Viet Nam\u2019s performance in poverty reduction over the past two decades has been \nremarkable. The country\u2019s overall poverty rate\u2014the proportion of the population living below the \nofficial poverty line\u2014has been on a sustained downward trend, from 58% in 1993 to 16% in \n2006, as measured by the Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey (Table A2.1).1 Much of \nthis success is attributed to the Government\u2019s ability to take advantage of sustained high \neconomic growth rates. \n \n2.  Growth has been particularly strong in the last several years, with real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) increasing by an average annual rate of 8% in 2003\u20132007. In 2007, GDP grew \nby 8.5%, the highest rate since 1996. GDP per capita at current prices increased from $441 in \n2002 to $818 in 2007, while GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars rose from \n$1,649 to $2,587. Inequality, as measured by the Gini index, has increased modestly, from 0.33 \nin 1993 to 0.42 in 2004 and 2006. At the same time, there have been significant improvements \nin social indicators, from increasing net enrollment rates to expanded health insurance coverage \nand improved access to electricity, clean water, and sanitation. These indicators, coupled with \nthe possession of durable goods, reflect significant improvements in people\u2019s standards of living. \nThe overall result is that about 35 million people have been able to escape from poverty over \n1993\u20131996. In 2006, about 13.4 million people out of the total population of about 84.2 million \nremained poor. Rapid inflation since 2007 is a cause for concern, and may reverse some of the \ngains made in poverty reduction particularly in urban areas. \n \nTable A2.1: Poverty Reduction in Viet Nam, 1993\u20132006 \n \nPopulation group  1993  1998  2002  2004  2006 \nPoverty rate (%)  58.1   37.4   28.9   19.5   16.0 \n  Urban   25.1   9.2   6.6   3.6   3.9 \n  Rural   66.4   45.5   35.6   25.0   20.4 \n  Kinh and Chinese   53.9   31.1   23.1   13.5   10.3 \n  Ethnic minorities   86.4   75.2   69.3   60.7   52.3 \nFood poverty rate (%)  24.9   15.0   10.9   7.4   6.7 \n  Urban   7.9   2.5   1.9   0.8   1.2 \n  Rural   29.1   18.6   13.6   9.7   8.7 \n  Kinh and Chinese   20.8   10.6   6.5   3.5   3.2 \n  Ethnic minorities   52.0   41.8   41.5   34.2   29.2 \nPoverty gap (%)  18.5   9.5   6.9   4.7   3.8 \n  Urban   6.4   1.7   1.3   0.7   3.2 \n  Rural   21.5   11.8   8.7   6.1   4.9 \n  Kinh and Chinese   16.0   7.1   4.7   2.6   2.0 \n  Ethnic minorities  34.7   24.2   22.8   19.2   15.4 \nSource: World Bank. 2007.

Food Poverty and the Poverty Gap. The food poverty rate (the proportion of people \nwhose total expenditure would not suffice for a daily intake of 2,100 calories even if it were \nentirely allocated to food) fell from 25% in 1993 to 7% in 2006. While falling rapidly, food poverty \nstill affects nearly 9% of rural households, and a full 29% of ethnic minority households. But it \nshould be noted that the poverty gap is closing; poor people across all population groups are \nmoving closer to the poverty line. The poverty gap\u2014the average distance from the poverty line, \nsometimes also called the depth of poverty\u2014fell from 6.9% in 2002 to 3.8% in 2006.2 For ethnic \nminorities, the poverty gap in 2006 was similar to that of the Kinh and Chinese majority 13 years \nearlier, in 1993. \n \n4.  Regional Disparities. Though the nationwide progress is undeniable, a look beyond \nnational averages is required to gain a more complete understanding of the poverty picture in \nViet Nam. There are significant disparities across regions (Table A2.2). The three regions with \nthe highest poverty rate in 2006, well above the national average of 16%, were the Northern \nMountains (30.2%), the North Central Coast (29.1%), and the Central Highlands (28%). The \nthree least-poor regions in 2006, where the poverty rate was significantly below the national \naverage,  were  the  Southeast  (5.8%),  the  Red  River  Delta  (8.8%),  and  the  Mekong  Delta \n(10.3%). But even in these relatively better-off areas there are persistent pockets of poverty. \n \nTable A2.2: Poverty in Viet Nam by Region, 1993\u20132006 \n(%) \nRegion  1993  1998  2002  2004  2006 \nNorthern Mountains   81.5   64.2   43.9   35.4   30.2 \nNortheast       38.4   29.4   25.0 \nNorthwest      68.0   58.6   49.0 \nRed River Delta   62.7   29.3   22.4   12.1   8.8 \nNorth Central Coast   74.5   48.1   43.9   31.9   29.1 \nSouth Central Coast   47.2   34.5   25.2   19.0   12.6 \nCentral Highlands   70.0   52.4   51.8   33.1   28.6 \nSoutheast   37.0   12.2   10.6   5.4   5.8 \nMekong Delta   47.1   36.9   23.4   15.9   10.3 \nViet Nam   58.1   37.4   28.9   19.5   16.0 \nSource: World Bank. 2007.

There  are  also  major  differences  between  urban  and  rural  poverty.  Viet  Nam  is \nurbanizing, but in 2006 the population was still about three-quarters rural. The rural poverty rate, \nat 20.4%, is substantially higher than the urban poverty rate of 3.9%, and the rural poor made \nup more than 93% of the country\u2019s poor people (Table A2.3). Farmers are the vast majority of \nthe rural population, and the poverty rate is much higher among rice farmers (23.4%) than \namong non-rice farmers (7.5%). While the urban poverty rate is very low, the 2006 data indicate \nthat it is increasing. As it is the first time in many years that poverty has been shown to be \nincreasing, it is important to assess the causes. The analysis in the Vietnam Development \nReport 2008 points to increasingly higher prices in the cities as a plausible explanation, citing a \nboom in real estate prices, which has increased the cost of retail trade and other services in the \n                                                \n2  World Bank. 2007.

Therefore, even basic staples can cost significantly more than in rural areas. \nHigher prices in urban areas can result in lower living standards for those whose earnings do \nnot grow accordingly and could push the near-poor into poverty. It must be noted that the rising \nurban poverty measured in 2006 was likely to have been worsened by the high inflation in 2007 \nand 2008. \n \nTable A2.3: Distribution of Poverty in Viet Nam, 2006 \n(%) \nShare of  Poverty  Poverty  Contribution to \nPopulation group  Population  Rate  Gap  Total Poverty \nTotal population  100.0  16.0  3.8  100.0 \n  Rural   73.3   20.4   4.9   93.6 \n  Urban   26.7   3.9   0.8   6.4 \nKinh and Hoa   86.5   10.2   2.0   55.6 \nEthnic minorities   13.5   52.2   15.4   44.4 \nNonfarmers   29.0   5.0   1.1   9.1 \nFarmers   71.0   20.4   4.9   90.9 \nSource: World Bank. 2008.

Poverty and Ethnic Minorities. Viet Nam\u2019s impressive growth story has unfortunately \nnot benefited all population groups equally. Ethnic minorities\u201453 officially recognized groups\u2014 \ncompose about 13.5% of the Vietnamese population. Minorities, with an average poverty rate of \n52.2% in 2006, are significantly worse off than the majority Kinh. By comparison, the poverty \nrate among the Kinh and Chinese was just 10.3%. With the exception of the Chinese and the \nKhmer and Cham, the remaining 50 ethnic groups mostly reside in remote, mountainous rural \nareas and are economically and socially disadvantaged across a range of dimensions. The \nmembers of ethnic minority groups are more than four times as likely to be poor than the Kinh \nand Hoa, and are also more likely to be malnourished, illiterate, and suffering from poor health. \nAccording to the 2004 Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey, less than one-third (29%) \nof all ethnic minority adults aged 18 and older had completed lower secondary education. \nPhysical access to social services in challenging mountainous terrain is a major constraint. \nEthnic minority children who are able to attend secondary school are faced with a major barrier \nto academic achievement in limited proficiency in the Vietnamese language. Poorly equipped \nschools, limited teacher supply, and teaching methods that fail to respond to the needs of \nnonnative  speakers  can  perpetuate  social  exclusion  and  isolation.  Despite  composing  a \nrelatively small share of the national population, minorities accounted for about 44% of the poor \nin 2006. Some government agencies forecast an increase in the number of the ethnic minority \npoor, to more than half of Viet Nam\u2019s poor population by 2010.3  \n \n7.  Most analyses of ethnic minority poverty in Viet Nam have compared two populations\u2014\nthe majority (Kinh and Chinese) and ethnic minorities (an aggregation of all other ethnic groups). \nHowever, ethnic minorities are in fact a heterogeneous group. Statistically representative data \n                                                \n3  Baulch, Bob. 2008. The Economic Development of Ethnic Minorities in Vietnam. Institute of Development Studies \nPolicy Brief.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \nare not available for all, given the very small numbers belonging to some groups, but recent \nresearch to distinguish between seven subgroups provides a sharper picture and allows a more \ndetailed assessment of their differences (footnote 3). The Vietnam Development Report 2008 \nfinds that ethnic minority groups based in the lowlands (Khmer and Cham) have seen dramatic \nrates of poverty reduction. Valley-dwelling rice farmers in the Northern Mountains (Tay, Thai, \nMuong and Nung) have also fared relatively better in terms of poverty reduction. But other \nminorities in the Northern Mountains, the Central Highlands, and the South and North Central \nCoasts remain extremely poor. The lack of progress for these groups tends to be hidden by the \nmore rapid improvements among the larger ethnic minority groups. For example, the overall \npoverty rate in the Central Highlands fell by a full 23 percentage points between 2002 and 2006. \nHowever, the disaggregated data suggest that there has been almost no movement in living \nstandards for minority groups in that region (including the Jarai, E-de, Ba Na, and Xo Dang). \n \n8.  Poverty Measurement. Two different poverty measurement methodologies are applied \nin Viet Nam\u2014one by the General Statistics Office of Viet Nam (GSO) and a second by the \nMinistry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA). The GSO implements the Viet Nam \nHousehold Living Standards Survey, an international standard living standards survey. The \npoverty rate is the percentage of the population that cannot afford a consumption basket that \ncomprises food and nonfood items, with food expenditure being high enough to secure 2,100 \ncalories per day for each household member. The food poverty rate is the proportion of the \npopulation that is too poor to afford the food part of the consumption basket, even if they did not \npurchase any nonfood items. The cost of the consumption basket (food plus nonfood) is referred \nto as the poverty line. The survey measures household expenditure.  \n \n9.  The MOLISA methodology is based on household income. In the 1990s MOLISA defined \nthe national poverty line as the income equivalent needed to buy 15, 20, and 25 kilograms of \nrice per person per month for mountainous, rural, and urban areas, respectively. In a 2005 \nmethodology revision, MOLISA increased the poverty line from D150,000 to D260,000 per \nperson per month for urban areas and from D100,000 to D200,000 for rural areas (including \nmountainous and remote areas).4 Under certain conditions, province and city administrations \nare authorized to raise the poverty line to allow more households to qualify for poverty programs. \nAfter revising the definition of the poverty line in 2005, MOLISA estimated that 26% of the \npopulation was classified as poor at the end of 2005, nearly twice the percentage under the \nearlier definition. This estimate fell to 18.7% of households in 2006, and 14.8% in 2007. The \nMOLISA approach to poverty assessment is more \u201cbottom\u2013up,\u201d as its local offices identify poor \nhouseholds consultation with villagers. The Vietnam Development Report 2008 assesses the \nGSO and MOLISA methods as essentially complementary, as the GSO metric is more reliable \nat aggregate levels while the MOLISA metric is better at the commune level. \n \n10.  International  Poverty  Lines. It is not surprising that poverty measured against the \ninternational  poverty  lines  of  $1-a-day  and  $2-a-day  in  1993  PPP  dollars  has  also  fallen \ndramatically in Viet Nam (Table A2.4). From more than half of the population in 1990, the \n$1-a-day poverty rate fell to just 4% of the population in 2007. It is generally accepted that \npoverty measured in this way is more of a tool for international comparisons over time rather \nthan current national policy-making or targeting, as the present value of $1 in 1993 PPP terms is \nextremely low. However, a look at the $2-a-day poverty head count sheds light on vulnerability \nto  poverty.  In  2006,  more  than  one-third  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  population  (36.3%)  fell  below  the \n$2-a-day  poverty  line.  Recalling  the  official  national  poverty  rate  of  16%,  the  significant \n                                                \n4  Under certain circumstances, provinces and cities are authorized to raise the poverty line to allow more households \nto qualify for poverty programs. \n ", "34  Appendix 2   \ndifference between the two indicates that a large share of the population subsists on the lower \nside of the income distribution, and is thus particularly vulnerable to falling into poverty.  \n \nTable A2.4: $1-a-Day and $2-a-Day Poverty in Viet Nam, 1990\u20132007 \n \n$1-a-Day    $2-a-Day \nPoverty  Poverty  Poverty  Poverty  Total \nRate  Magnitude   Rate  Magnitude  Population \nYear  (%)  (million)  (%)  (million)  (million) \n1990    50.8    33.6    87.0    57.6    66.2 \n1996    23.6    17.3    69.4    50.8    73.2 \n1999    16.9    13.0    65.9    50.5    76.6 \n2002    13.6    10.9    58.2    46.4    79.7 \n2004    7.8    6.4    43.9    36.0    82.0 \n2007    4.0    3.4    32.9    28.1    85.3 \nNote: The World Bank sets the international poverty lines at $1.08 and $2.15 per person per \nday (1993 purchasing power parity dollars) for all countries.

According to the most recent progress report for Asia \nand the Pacific, Viet Nam is an early achiever for most of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs).5 Early  MDG  achievement  is reported for the  targets  of reducing  poverty  and  the \nincidence of underweight children, achieving gender equality at the secondary level, reducing \nthe under-five mortality and infant mortality rates, reducing the tuberculosis prevalence rate and \ndeath rate, maintaining forest cover and protected areas, and increasing access to clean water \nin urban and rural areas and sanitation in urban areas (Table A2.5). The rate of progress toward \nthe rural sanitation target is considered on track, as is the primary cohort survival rate (e.g., the \nproportion of children starting grade 1 that reach grade 5). The less-encouraging news is that \nViet  Nam  is  making  only  slow  progress  on  gender  equality  at  the  primary  level.  Offtrack \nMDGs\u2014where there is either no progress or regression\u2014include the targets related to primary \nenrollment and primary completion rates, gender equality at the tertiary level, HIV prevalence, \nand carbon dioxide emissions. Viet Nam is commendable for its development of additional goals, \nbeyond the MDGs, as part of the process of developing their national development targets. The \nViet Nam Development Goals (VDGs) are the local version of the MDGs and are, in a sense, \nmore ambitious.  \n \n                                                \n5  UN ESCAP, ADB, UNDP. 2007.

Policy Framework for Poverty Reduction  \n \n12.  Robust economic growth has been the key driver of poverty reduction in Viet Nam, but \ngovernment policies and targeted programs have played a major role in making that growth \npro-poor. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is embedded in the Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010.  \n \n13.  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010.  The  National  Assembly  approved \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 in 2006. Unlike previous plans, SEDP 2006\u20132010 was prepared in an open \nand participatory manner involving extensive consultations with civil society, businesses, and \ndevelopment agencies. It is oriented more toward attaining development outcomes (including \npoverty reduction) and less toward achieving production targets. The SEDP has a strong results \norientation, with performance indicators that include the VDGs and the MDGs. Its goals include \n ", "36  Appendix 2   \naverage annual real GDP growth of at least 7.5% and a reduction in the poverty rate to 10%\u2013\n11% in 2010 (from 22% in 2005). SEDP 2006\u20132010 sets out desired development outcomes \nand the policy reforms needed to attain them. It relies on analysis rather than administrative \nreporting to substantiate its recommendations and includes a framework for monitoring progress. \nThe SEDP identifies appropriate policies and aligns resources with those policies, which fall into \nthree main pillars: (i) business development, (ii) inclusive growth, and (iii) natural resource \nmanagement. Governance and institutional development is a crosscutting theme to deliver in \nthe three pillars. The joint International Development Association\u2013International Monetary Fund \nstaff advisory note on Viet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy dated 5 December 2006 concludes \nthat SEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to lead \nto economic growth and poverty reduction.6 \n \n14.  The SEDP\u2019s overarching goal statement is supported by eight core task areas, of which \nthe  sixth  pertains  particularly  to  poverty  reduction  and  social  development:  \u201crealize  social \nprogress, equity, and gender equality; create jobs, encourage wealth creation through legitimate \nchannels, reduce poverty and alleviate hunger, develop the social security system and prevent \nsocial  problems.\u201d7 Unlike  the  previous  plan  (SEDP  2001\u20132005),  this  one  clearly  defines \ndevelopment targets, identifies appropriate policies, and aligns resources with those policies. \nThe stated goals in the area of \u201csocial affairs\u201d are to continue on a path toward achieving the \nMDGs, as follows:  \n \n(i)  Universal lower secondary education is achieved. By 2010 tertiary education is \nprovided to 200 per 10,000 people. Trained labor rate reaches 40% of total social \nlabor. \n(ii)  All households in need have access to housing at 14\u201315 square meters per \ncapita, telephone density reaches 35 sets per 100 people, Internet subscriptions \nare 12.6 per 100 people, Internet users are 48% of the population, with expanded \nuse of information technology. \n(iii)  The  population  growth  rate  is  low  at  1.14%,  population  does  not  exceed \n88.4 million, and the urban population is about 26.4 million. \n(iv)  Jobs are created for more than 8 million laborers, meaning an average of 1.6 \nmillion jobs per year. Vocational training is offered to 7.5 million people, of whom \n25%\u201330% receive long-term training. The urban unemployment rate stays below \n5%. \n(v)  The agricultural labor force is reduced to 50% of the population. \n(vi)  Average life expectancy is 72 years. \n(vii)  Maternal mortality is reduced to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, the number \nof  doctors  reaches  7  per  100,000  people,  and  pharmacists  with  university \ndegrees reach 1\u20131.2 per 10,000, with hospital beds at 26.3 per 10,000 people. \n(viii)  Food poverty is eliminated, and the poverty rate is reduced to 10%\u201311% by 2010.  \n \n15.  This SEDP makes stronger references to participatory and inclusive approaches than \nprevious plans, following on the CPGRS which stated that poverty reduction enables poor \ncommunities  to  take  initiative,  and  encouraged  self-help  efforts.  The  CPRGS  set  out  the \nGovernment\u2019s intent to involve civil society and community organizations at the local level to \nimprove the participation of the poor in the development process. SEDP 2006\u20132010 includes \n                                                \n6  IMF and IDA. 2006.

Social Protection and Targeted Programs for Poverty Reduction \n16.  The SEDP recognizes that social protection and targeted programs for poverty reduction \nare required for inclusive growth. Social protection expands opportunities, enhances equity, and \nprotects  against  risks  and  shocks.  Targeted  programs  focus  on  particularly  disadvantaged \ngroups and geographic areas. \n \n17.  Viet Nam fares reasonably well in comparison with the 30 other countries in Asia and the \nPacific according to ADB\u2019s social protection index (SPI).9 The SPI values range from a low of \n0.01 (Papua New Guinea) to a high of 0.96 (Japan). Viet Nam\u2019s SPI of 0.38 ranks the country at \n13 out of 31, just below Nauru but above Malaysia. The SPI is a composite index based on four \nsocial protection summary indicators. Expenditure measures total expenditure on all social \nprotection  programs  as  a  share  of  GDP  (0.041  in  Viet  Nam).  Coverage  measures  the \nbeneficiaries of targeted social protection as a share of the reference population group, i.e., the \nelderly,  the  disabled,  the  unemployed,  etc.  (0.40).  Distribution  calculates  the  number  of \nbeneficiaries who are poor as a share of the poor population, or efficiency of poverty targeting \n(0.71). Impact is the average social protection expenditure for each poor person as a share of \nthe national poverty line (0.17). Viet Nam falls into the group of countries with an average SPI \nranking (the all-Asia average is 0.36). The policy priority for countries with average SPIs is likely \nto  be  improving  the  efficiency,  functioning,  and  targeting  of  current  programs.  The  social \nprotection summary indicator for impact, at 17%, is lower than the average of 23% for Asia. \n \n18.  Social  Safety  Nets.  Social  safety  net  programs  (e.g.,  social  assistance  and  child \nprotection) account for 29% of Viet Nam\u2019s total social protection expenditure (27.4% and 1.6% \nrespectively). The target group coverage ratios are 64.6% of the poor, 100% of the disabled, \nand 62.4% of targeted children. Viet Nam\u2019s overall social protection summary indicator for \ncoverage,  at  0.40,  is  high;  only  eight  other  countries  have  values  higher  than  this.  In  a \ndecentralized country like Viet Nam, the amount of budgetary resources at the local level has a \nmajor influence on the ability to implement social policy, deliver social services, and provide \nsafety nets. According to the Vietnam Development Report 2008, powerful allocation norms \nhave been set up to transfer resources from richer to poorer provinces (on a scale much larger \nthan similar efforts in richer countries) but there has been less progress in the allocation of \nprovincial  resources  to  districts,  communes,  and  below.  In  general,  programs  targeted  to \nspecific households are of mixed quality. Some have considerable impact but others are less \neffective. \n \n19.  Labor  Market  Programs. The  SPI  assessment  of  social  protection  expenditure  by \ncategory of program shows that only 7.7% of the total goes toward labor market programs \n                                                \n8 The  Grassroots  Democracy  Decree  79  (2003)  institutionalizes  the  participation  of  local  communities  and \ncommunity-based organizations in development activities. A UNDP assessment finds that Viet Nam\u2019s legal \nframework for facilitating participation and consultation is well-developed, but that local people\u2019s knowledge of and \naccess to the \u201cthe legal framework\u201d is limited and consequently tends to be interpreted by officials at their own \ndiscretion. http://www.un.org.vn/undp/projects/vie02007/News2005/project_supports_undp_assessment.htm \n9  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "38  Appendix 2   \n(direct  employment  generation,  labor  exchanges  and  other  employment  services,  skills \ndevelopment and training, and the development of labor legislation) in Viet Nam. \n \n20.  Each of the country\u2019s 64 provinces has a vocational training center under the local \ndepartment  of  labor,  invalids,  and  social  affairs.  The  Government  implements  a  National \nTargeted Program on Job Generation and provides credit through the National Fund for Job \nCreation and the Social Policy Bank. The vocational training system is being strengthened and \ndiversified  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  labor  market.  The  Government  does  not  provide \nunemployment insurance, but it does give (i) allowances for early retirement; (ii) access to credit \nfor opening new business after retirement; and (iii) free vocational training for the poor in \ngovernment-run vocational training centers. In the ADB SPI analysis of target group coverage \nratios, only 9.4% of the unemployed and underemployed are covered by social protection \nprograms. \n \n21.  Viet Nam introduced a minimum wage for foreign-invested companies in 1990 and for \ndomestic enterprises in 1993. The former varies by region; the latter is uniform throughout the \ncountry. The ratio between minimum and average wages in domestic enterprises has increased \nmoderately,  from  25%  in  1998  to  32%  in  2006,  but  minimum  wages  applying  to  foreign \ncompanies remain substantially higher. The margin varies from more than 50% to more than \n90% depending on the region. This is incompatible with the national treatment principle of the \nWorld Trade Organization. Viet Nam thus needs to unify the minimum wage, and this will mean \nincreasing the domestic enterprise minimum wage. This may affect employment creation and \nformalization.  \n \n22.  Old-Age Pensions. Before doi moi Viet Nam only had an old-age pension program for \ncivil servants and workers in state-owned enterprises. Coverage was extended in 1993 to \ndomestic  and  foreign  private  enterprises  on  a  contributory  basis.  These  programs  are \nadministered by Viet Nam Social Security (VSS). There is also a noncontributory scheme for \npeople over 85 who lack resources (administered by MOLISA). The system is now undergoing \nmajor and rapid reform. The first Social Insurance Law was passed in 2006, with various \nelements being implemented over 2007\u20132009. The aim is to expand coverage and ensure \nfinancial sustainability. Along with a voluntary pension program for informal sector workers, the \ncompulsory program applies to all Vietnamese working in any enterprise provided they have at \nleast a 3-month contract. To receive a pension, participants must contribute for 20 years. The \nminimum pension is set equal to the minimum wage; the maximum is 75% of the average salary. \nRetirement age is relatively low at 55 for women and 60 for men. The main difference between \nthe voluntary and the compulsory programs is that under the voluntary scheme there is no \nceiling on contributions and no minimum pension. \n \n23.  Participation in the compulsory scheme is growing steadily from its low base, with about \n8  million  active  contributors  in  2007  (18%  of  the  labor  force  and  54%  of  employment  in \nstate-owned enterprises, foreign companies, and private domestic firms). In 2007 there were \nabout 1.9 million pensioners, about 25% of the population aged 60 and above. But almost half \nof pension spending went to the richest two quintiles, with only 2% to the poorest\u2014the pension \nsystem is thus not pro-poor. Whether the national voluntary pension program for the informal \nsector will attract many members is not yet clear. The largest voluntary pension scheme in \nViet Nam operates in the province of Nghe An, with about 85,000 participants in 2007. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \n24.  Targeted Programs for Poverty Reduction.10 Viet Nam implements a host of targeted \nprograms to reach the most disadvantaged. Some provide cash support to particular vulnerable \ngroups; others deliver other forms of targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups or regions. \nThe pricing of utilities such as water can also be based on different groups\u2019 ability to pay. Cash \ntransfers  are  paid  out  by  social  guarantee  funds,  which  provide  regular  relief  to  defined \nvulnerable groups and to war veterans and war invalids. Subsidies are provided through the \nNational Targeted Program for Poverty Reduction (NTPPR), formerly the Hunger Eradication \nand  Poverty  Reduction  Program.  Development  assistance  to  poor  communes  is  managed \nthrough program 135 (program for socioeconomic development in communes facing extreme \nhardship in ethnic minority and mountainous areas), whereas program 132 and program 134 \nseek to support ethnic minorities with agricultural and residential land, housing, and water \nsupply. These initiatives differ not only in the nature of the benefits they provide, but also in the \ntargeting techniques they apply to identify beneficiaries. \n \n25.  Activities  under  the  NTPPR  2006\u20132010  fall  into  three  areas:  (i)  development  of \nproductive activities of the poor, (ii) provision of access to basic services, and (iii) capacity \ndevelopment and monitoring. The first area includes the largest single component of the NTPPR, \nthe provision of preferential credit. The second area focuses on health care, education, housing, \nwater supply, and legal aid. A total of D43.5 trillion has been allocated to this program over a \n5-year period, with 60% going to the provision of preferential credit. The central budget covers \n29% of the envelope, with local governments and local communities expected to contribute a \nfurther 5% and 6%, respectively. \n \n26.  The  NTPPR,  like  its  predecessor  (the  Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction \nProgram 2001\u20132005), targets households that have been identified as poor using the MOLISA \nmethodology. In practice, whether household income is above or below the threshold is decided \nthrough a combination of surveys and community discussions. Program 135 is geographically \ntargeted. The first phase of the program allocated D700 million per year to identified communes. \nPoverty maps show that the communes targeted by program 135 were generally those with \nhigher poverty rates. Targeting issues arise at lower levels, as resource allocation may favor \nwealthier villages within a commune and not everyone in a village is necessarily poor. The \nsecond phase of program 135 (2006\u20132010) is tackling these issues by requiring the inclusion of \nboth poorer villages within the poorest \u201czone III\u201d communes and the poorest villages in the \nless-poor \u201czone II\u201d communes. \n \n27.  The overall number of beneficiaries from targeted programs is not easy to estimate. In \nthe case of the Social Guarantee Fund for Regular Relief, it has increased more than threefold \nover the first part of the decade. The number of beneficiaries has risen in all categories. Yet, \nregular relief in the form of monthly cash transfers to vulnerable groups still covers only a small \nfraction (about 0.5%) of the Vietnamese population. Although funding has increased, reaching \nD750 billion in 2007, it remains an important constraint. The resources supporting these cash \ntransfers come from a combination of national and local sources, with their amount varying \nwidely across the country. \n                                                \n10 This discussion is summarized from World Bank. 2007. Vietnam Development Report 2008: Social Protection. Joint \ndonor report to the Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting, Hanoi, 6\u20137 December 2007 (Chapter 7: Targeted \nPrograms). \n ", "40  Appendix 2   \nD.  Challenges in Poverty Reduction \n28.  Persistent  Pockets  of  Poverty.  Though  the  overall  poverty  reduction  picture  is \nimpressive, there are still about 13.4 million people living in poverty in Viet Nam, with 5\u20136 million \nexperiencing food poverty. It is important to focus on those places and populations where \npoverty persists, and to understand the reasons why they are not benefiting from economic \ngrowth like the majority of the population. Ethnic minorities are at a major disadvantage, and, \nwhile some of the targeted programs work well, much more remains to be done. \n \n29.  Rising Urban Poverty. Certainly poverty remains an overwhelmingly rural phenomenon. \nBut the figures for 2006 suggest that economic growth alone may not be sufficient to deal with \npoverty in urban areas. The major cities of Viet Nam have been booming for many years, but \nurban poverty appears to have stabilized, if not increased, from 2004 to 2006. Statistical issues \nnotwithstanding,11 any  increase  raises  questions  in  a  country  where  poverty  has  fallen \nconsistently  and  rapidly  over  the  past  13  years.  Understanding  why  this  is  so  particularly \nimportant for adjusting social protection policies in a period of rapid urbanization (footnote 2). \n \n30.  High Vulnerability to Poverty. From the large difference between the $1-a-day and the \n$2-a-day poverty rate (4% and 33% in 2007, respectively) it is clear that many Vietnamese can \nbe considered near-poor, and thus particularly vulnerable to falling into poverty in the face of \nshocks. Global macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated since the second half of 2007. In \naddition to a slowdown in industrial countries, there is considerable uncertainty in financial \nmarkets and a surge in the world prices of commodities. Increases in the international prices of \nrice and oil are of particular concern. Latent inflationary pressures can remain, adding to the \nnegative social impact of recent higher prices.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nViet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is embedded in the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. \nIts development goals (the country\u2019s version of the Millennium Development Goals), the key targets pursued by the \nSEDP, include eliminating food poverty and reducing the poverty rate to 10%\u201311% by 2010. The SEDP also \nidentifies appropriate policies and aligns resources with those policies, which are concerned with (i) promoting \ngrowth and transition to a market economy, (ii) reducing poverty and ensuring social inclusion, (iii) managing the \nenvironment and natural resources, and (iv) building institutions to support the strategy. The joint International \nDevelopment Association\u2013International Monetary Fund staff advisory note of December 2006 concluded that \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to lead to economic growth and \npoverty reduction. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam supports the implementation of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010. \n \nThe SEDP policies, however, are considered remarkably broad and must be prioritized and sequenced. Measures \nmust be selected within each of the pillars and attention must be paid to the content of the most important ones. The \nWorld Bank\u2019s poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs) are multisector instruments well suited to satisfying these \nrequirements. The first PRSC cycle provided effective support for policy reforms, according to several independent \nevaluations. The second PRSC cycle, starting with PRSC 6 in 2007, will support the implementation of SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010. Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V will be ADB\u2019s fifth policy-based \nlending operation in Viet Nam and will provide parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s PRSC 7. PRSC 7 identifies \npolicy areas in SEDP 2006\u20132010 and other key documents and strategies and classifies them into four pillars: \n(i) business development, (ii) social inclusion, (iii) natural resources management, and (iv) governance. Unlike \nSIPRPs I\u2013IV, which were all single-tranche standard program loans, SIPRP V will take the program cluster \napproach. It will consist of three chronologically ordered subprograms, which will help the Government carry out the \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 in 2008\u20132010.  \n \nSIPRP V will directly contribute to poverty reduction by supporting the implementation of policy actions that will \nincrease social assistance to the poor and the near-poor. The poor will directly benefit from the increase in the \nGovernment\u2019s contribution to their health insurance premiums and from participation in the voluntary pension \nprogram. The near-poor will directly benefit from government subsidies for their health insurance premiums. As \nrobust economic growth has been the key driver of poverty reduction in Viet Nam, SIPRP V would indirectly reduce \npoverty by supporting other policy actions that ensure high and sustainable economic growth. These policy reforms \nwill raise the living standards of the Vietnamese people by fostering environmentally sustainable and socially \ninclusive economic growth, increase budget revenue by expanding the tax base, and reduce budget expenditure by \nimproving public financial management. Ethnic minorities will benefit more than the ethnic majority from these \nactions because the poverty rate is significantly higher among ethnic minorities than among the ethnic majority.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                             Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nKey Issues  \nSIPRP V supports the implementation of policy reforms in (i) business development, (ii) social inclusion, (iii) natural \nresources management, and (iv) governance. The policy reforms will affect the economy as a whole. The SIPRP V \nactivities do not focus on specific households, on sectors or subsectors that directly support the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), or on key constraints on poverty reduction in specific geographic areas. \nInstead, they will generally improve the enabling policy and institutional environment for pro-poor growth, social \ndevelopment, and good governance, thereby indirectly reducing poverty. Therefore, SIPRP V is classified as a \ngeneral intervention.  \n \nThe policy reforms supported by SIPRP V belong to the sector of law, economic management, and public policy, in \nthe  three  key  thematic  areas  of  (i)  sustainable  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  and \n ", "    Appendix 9  57 \n(iii) governance. SIPRP V supports the implementation of 12 specific policy actions in all four pillars of PRSC 7. \nGenerally, the sector support provided by SIPRP V will lead to poverty reduction by promoting (i) business \ndevelopment and wider availability of economic opportunities for the poor and near-poor; (ii) a reduction in the \nhealth, economic, and environmental vulnerabilities of the poor and other excluded groups; and (iii) an increase in \ngovernment accountability in the use of public resources and the management of SEDP targets. \n \nViet Nam\u2019s overall poverty rate has been on a sustained downward trend in the last two decades. The overall \npoverty rate dropped from 58.1% in 1993 to 28.9% in 2002, and to 16% in 2006. Still, about 13.4 million people live \nin poverty in Viet Nam, and 5\u20136 million experience food poverty. As the large difference between $1-a-day and \n$2-a-day poverty (4% and 33% in 2007, respectively) makes clear, many Vietnamese can be considered near-poor, \nand thus particularly vulnerable to falling into poverty in the face of shocks. The disparities in poverty across \nregions, areas, and ethnics remain significant. In 2006, the three poorest regions had poverty rates of 28%\u201331%, \nmuch higher than the 5%\u201311% in the three least-poor regions. The rural poverty rate, at 20.4%, is substantially \nhigher than the urban poverty rate of 3.9%. Ethnic minorities, with an average poverty rate of 52.2%, are \nsignificantly worse off than the majority Kinh, with a poverty rate of 10.3%.  \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  impressive  economic  growth  has  unfortunately  not  benefited  all  population  groups  equally.  The \nminorities accounted for about 44% of the poor in 2006 and will constitute more than half of Viet Nam\u2019s poor \npopulation by 2010. Ethnic minorities are at a major disadvantage, and their poverty persists. Almost all the ethnic \nminorities reside in remote, mountainous rural areas and are economically and socially disadvantaged across a \nrange of dimensions. The members of ethnic minority groups are more likely to be malnourished, illiterate, and \nsuffering from poor health. Physical access to social services in challenging mountainous terrain is a major \nconstraint. Poorly equipped schools, limited supply of teachers, and teaching methods that do not respond to the \nneeds of nonnative speakers can perpetuate social exclusion and isolation. Furthermore, the urban poverty rate, \nafter increasing in 2006, is believed to have been worsened in 2007 and 2008 by increasingly higher prices in the \ncities, resulting in lower living standards for those whose earnings do not grow accordingly and pushing the \nnear-poor into poverty. \n \nSocial protection and targeted programs for poverty reduction are required for inclusive growth. Social protection \nexpands opportunities, enhances equity, and protects against risks and shocks. Social protection in Viet Nam takes \nthe form of social safety nets, labor market programs, and old-age pensions. Social safety net programs account for \n29% of Viet Nam\u2019s total social protection expenditure and cover 64.6% of the poor. In general, programs for specific \nhouseholds are of mixed quality, with some having considerable impact but others less effective. Under the National \nTargeted Program on Job Generation, the Government provides credits for job creation and free vocational training \nfor the poor in government-run vocational training centers. The old-age pension includes a voluntary pension \nprogram, whose coverage has been expanded to include informal sector workers, and a compulsory program \napplied to all Vietnamese doing contractual work in any enterprise. The minimum pension is equal to the minimum \nwage; the maximum is 75% of the average salary. However, the attractiveness of the national voluntary pension \nprogram for the informal sector is unclear, while only 2% of the compulsory scheme benefits the poorest.  \n \nViet Nam implements a host of targeted programs to reach the most disadvantaged groups and geographic areas. \nThe National Targeted Program for Poverty Reduction (NTPPR) provides assistance to poor households in three \nareas: (i) development of productive activities for the poor, mainly through preferential credit, (ii) access to basic \nservices  (health  care,  education,  housing,  water  supply  and  legal  aid);  and  (iii)  capacity  development  and \nmonitoring. The second phase of a program for socioeconomic development in communes face with extreme \nhardship in ethnic minority and mountainous areas (program 135) provides development assistance to poor villages \nin the poorest communes, and to the poorest villages in less-poor communes. Programs 132 and 134 support ethnic \nminorities with agricultural and residential land, housing, and water supply. Although there is no estimate of the total \nnumber of beneficiaries of targeted programs, the figure has reportedly risen. \n \nThe Government is aware of the challenges that face it, and has prepared an explicit section on ethnic support in \nSEDP 2006\u20132010. The Government also has preferential and special programs for the poor and special programs \nfor ethnic people in these regions, e.g., the comprehensive Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction Program \n2006\u20132010 and other targeted programs, such as program 135. These programs have generally benefited the poor. \nThe programs could be made more effective through further decentralization, a focus on capacity building, and \nparticipation by the affected people in planning, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nThe specific policy actions supported by SIPRP V will contribute directly as well as indirectly to poverty reduction in \nViet Nam. SIPRP V supports the implementation of policies that will reduce the health and economic risks of the \npoor and the near-poor\u2014the policy of increasing the health insurance premiums for the poor and providing partial \nsubsidies for the near-poor, and the policy of introducing voluntary pension programs for farmers and informal \nsector, allowing the poor to participate. On the other hand, the policy support in business development and \n ", "58  Appendix 9 \ngovernance will have indirect impact on poverty reduction. Particularly, SIPRP V supports a series of policies that \nwill (i) enhance the efficient use of public resources by state economic groups and general corporations, including \nstate-owned commercial banks and state electricity providers; (ii) introduce more competition into the economy by \nraising the cap on shareholdings by single foreign investors; and (iii) stimulate the development of household \nbusinesses through tax reforms. The policies of monitoring SEDP implementation, regulating the disclosure of state \naudit reports, and extending \u201cone-stop shop\u201d (OSS) services to all ministries and agencies are expected to \nstrengthen government accountability and capacity to manage pro-poor growth. \n \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n \nThe policy actions supported by SIPRP V will have both direct and indirect impact on some targeted groups and the \neconomy as a whole over the medium term. First, the operating efficiency of large state-owned enterprises will \nimprove.  Assessing  transactions  among  affiliated  parties  within  economic  groups  and  general  corporations, \napproving and completing the equitization plans of two state-owned commercial banks, and separating power \ntransmission and generation assets will directly affect these state-owned enterprises and banks. These policies are \nexpected to increase the efficient use of public resources and improve the quality of services provided by these \nenterprises. Second, more economic opportunities will be created for the private sector. The policy of raising the cap \non the shareholdings of single foreign investors will directly benefit foreign investors, while the policy of rationalizing \nincentives related to the enterprise income tax and simplifying tax procedures for household businesses will directly \nlead to an expansion in the economic activities of domestic private enterprises and production units. Third, more \nsupporting administrative procedures will be instituted for enterprises as well as people. The policy of extending \nOSS services and introducing interlinked OSS services will further simplify administrative procedures. These \npolicies will benefit a wide range of groups. Fourth, the regulation specifying the content and timing of disclosure of \nState Audit of Viet Nam reports will increase government accountability for the use of public resources. Fifth, \ngovernment capacity to monitor the SEDP 2006\u20132010 targets, including the poverty targets, will be strengthened. \nFinally, the provision of subsidized health insurance and the introduction of voluntary pension programs will reduce \nthe health and economic risks of the poor and the near-poor. \n \nAll the policy actions under SIPRP V will have no adverse impact on vulnerable groups, particularly the poor and the \nnear-poor. on the other hand, these policy actions will have a positive impact on the poor and the near-poor by \n(i) promoting the development of the private sector, especially household businesses, and thus increasing demand \nfor unskilled labor; (ii) making net public transfers to the poor and near-poor through subsidies for health insurance \npremiums; and (iii) facilitating access to public goods and services through more efficient state economic groups \nand general operations, which provide public utilities, especially electricity.   \n \nThe policy actions under SIPRP V will have an indirect rather than a direct impact on the MDGs. These policy \nactions are not directly linked to the MDG targets. However, their implementation will lay the foundation for \nachieving these targets. The policy actions under SIPRP V will address the major structural weaknesses of Viet \nNam\u2019s economy, and therefore make economic growth more sustainable and improve living standards in general.  \n \nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThere may still be around 13.5 million people living in poverty in Viet Nam, with between five and six million being \nfood-poor. People in the rural or mountainous areas are more likely to be poor than those living in urban or lowland \nareas. Overall, the ethnic minorities are still much poorer than the Kinh and Chinese majority. The main constraints \non the ability of the ethnic minorities to lift themselves out of the poverty are poor infrastructure, lack of access to \nsocial services, low educational attainment, and limited land for agriculture production. Furthermore, domestic \nmigrants outside the agriculture sector are very vulnerable to economic shocks.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 9  59 \n  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Summary of the consultation and participation (C&P) process during the program preparation \n \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 makes stronger references to participatory and inclusive approaches than previous plans. It \nexpands the participation and heightens the role of nongovernment organizations and intensifies the participation of \npeople, communities, and civil society in planning, implementation, and monitoring, from central to local levels. \nViet Nam\u2019s development partners have aligned their efforts behind SEDP 2006\u20132010, expressing satisfaction with \nits preparation process and acknowledging it as a credible strategy for fostering economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The SEDP is a comprehensive document dealing with almost every aspect of economic reform. As it \nstrongly  focuses  on  social  inclusion  and  poverty  reduction,  the  SEDP  is  considered  a  tool  of  upstream \nharmonization, giving government and the international community a shared view of what needs to be done.  \n \nThe PRSCs identify policy actions within the SEDP framework. They constitute a platform for continued policy \ndialogue on a broad range of issues with government counterparts and were jointly drawn up by many development \npartners through regular meetings held to reach consensus on how to proceed, discuss ideas and plans with the \nGovernment, and assess progress on economic reform. The new PRSC cycle was prepared on the basis of the \nViet Nam Development Report 2007, Aiming High, which translated the SEDP into a workable set of policy actions, \nwith proper prioritization and sequencing. The new cycle also takes into account the concerns brought up during the \nmidyear consultative group meeting and the Viet Nam Business Forum. In 2007, a series of consultations on PRSC \noperations took place with government officials, elected representatives, civil society, and the private sector. \nPRSC 7 grew out of the existing donor commitments to support Viet Nam\u2019s reform agenda. Fourteen policy areas \nwere chosen and these were discussed over several rounds of technical meetings with 20 line ministries and \ngovernment agencies. \n \n2.  What level of C&P is envisaged during the program implementation and monitoring? \n \n\u2327 Information sharing     \u2327 Consultation    (cid:2) Collaborative decision making      (cid:2) Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?  (cid:2) Yes \u2327 No \n \nThe policy actions of SIPRP V are based on PRSC 7, which is being jointly undertaken by the participating \ndevelopment agencies. As ADB has joined the PRSC process, no further C&P plan is needed. \n \n \nC.  Gender Development \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nOver the last 20 years, Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in reducing gender disparities. Ranked 80th \namong 136 countries on the gender development index, it is one of the Southeast Asian countries that have made \nthe most rapid progress in closing the gender gaps. There are few differences between boys and girls in nutrition \nand school enrollment. The country has virtually achieved universal primary education, is on the way to attaining \nuniversal lower secondary education, has achieved high adult literacy rates for men and women, and has exceeded \nthe target of 30% of postgraduate qualifications going to women. With 83% of women between the ages of 15 and \n60 participating in the labor force, its participation rates for women in economic activities are the highest in the \nworld. The number of women engaged in wage employment has increased, and now accounts for 26% of the \nfemale labor force. Similarly, the gender gap in wages and incomes has declined significantly. Viet Nam also has \nthe highest percentage of women in national parliament in Asia and the Pacific, at around 27% since 2002.  \n \nDespite  the  country\u2019s  impressive  achievements  in  narrowing  gender  gaps,  however,  women  remain  at  a \ndisadvantage compared with men. First, ethnic minority women and girls lag behind ethnic minority men and Kinh \nand Chinese women in access to health, health insurance, education services, and economic opportunities; around \none-fifth of ethnic minority young women have never attended school, ethnic minority girls of school age are more \nlikely than their male counterparts to be working, and 87% of ethnic minority women in rural areas are self-employed \nin agriculture and least likely to be in wage employment. Second, women are overrepresented in agriculture \nself-employment because of poor access to skills training, which limits their ability to apply for some jobs. Third, \nmen benefit more from jobs with decision-making power and that offer higher pay and professional prospects. \nFourth, while the wage gap has narrowed, men still earn more than women. Fifth, men and women contribute equal \ntime to income generation but not to housework. As a result, women work an average of 13 hours a day, compared \nwith only 9 hours for men. Sixth, men\u2019s opportunities to capitalize assets are greater than women\u2019s. Women are less \n ", "60  Appendix 9 \nlikely to have security of land tenure, which would not only give them better access to capital, but would also \nincrease their security in case of divorce or inheritance. Lastly, very few women are represented in leadership \npositions at the central level. Women are almost invisible in leadership positions across most departments and all \nsectors at the local level. \n \n2.  Key Actions \n \nViet Nam has developed a strong legal, policy, and institutional environment to empower women and reduce gender \ngaps. Its Constitution provides for gender equality and SEDP 2006\u20132010 integrates gender equality considerations \nin agriculture, employment, environmental management, health, and education. Viet Nam was one of the first \ncountries to sign and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The \nnew Law on Gender Equality decrees equal rights for women in many areas such as the political arena, economic \nopportunity, labor, employment, education and training, science and technology, health care, culture information and \nsports, and family. This law represents a unified legal framework for addressing gender disparities and increasing \nwomen\u2019s participation in decision making. The Land Law requires the inclusion of the names of both husband and \nwife in all new land use right certificates. The National Strategy for the Advancement of Women to 2010 identifies \npriorities related to gender equality. The National Committee for the Advancement of Women is a high-level \nmultisectoral committee responsible for promoting gender equality. The Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union is a mass \norganization for women that facilitates the implementation of projects and programs at the local level, in addition to \nrepresenting its members in national policy dialogue. \n \nPRSC 7 directly supports women by defining institutional responsibilities for the implementation of the Gender \nEquality Law and the monitoring of gender equality. Although SIPRP V does not include policy actions in the gender \narea, its two policy actions related to health insurance premiums and participation in the voluntary pension program \ndirectly address the health care and economic disadvantages of women, especially among the ethnic minorities. \n \n(cid:2) Gender plan            (cid:2) Other actions/measures              \u2327 No action/measure \n \nIII.

Neither PRSC 7 nor  (cid:2) Resettlement framework \nSIPRP V covers policy areas that directly  \u2327 None \nrelate to resettlement.    \n \nHowever, under previous PRSCs, a \nregulation was issued by the Government to \naddress resettlement. Decision 33 provides \npolicy support for the resettlement of ethnic \nminorities in 2007\u20132010. These policies \ninclude community support (infrastructure \ninvestment, cash subsidies for land \ncompensation, staff) as well as support for \nindividual households (land assignment, \ncash subsidies).  \n \nIn 2006, ADB and the Committee for Ethnic \nMinorities completed a joint situational \nanalysis of resettlement policies in the \nnorthern mountainous areas. This study was \nused in the preparation of PRSCs 6\u20137. \n       \nIndigenous  No Impact   The redesigned program for socioeconomic  (cid:2) Plan \nPeoples  development in communes faced with  (cid:2) Other action \n  extreme hardship in ethnic minority and  (cid:2) Indigenous peoples \nmountainous areas (2006\u20132010), known as  framework \nprogram 135\u2013phase 2, supports  \u2327 No action \n ", "    Appendix 9  61 \nsocioeconomic development in about 1,644   \nof the country\u2019s poorest communes and   \n2,500 of its poorest villages, through a \ncombination of rural infrastructure, \nproduction and livelihood enhancement, and \ninstitutional capacity-building services.  \n \nPRSC 7 covers two policy areas with direct \nimpact on ethnic minority poverty. First, \ntuition fees at the secondary and tertiary \nlevels will be reviewed and made to better \nreflect market conditions, and policies will be \nstrengthened to protect the poor. The \nmeasures to be carried out in this regard \ninclude the application of (i) the lowest fee \nlevel in remote areas, where most of the \nethnic minorities live; (ii) scholarship grants \nof up to 80% of the minimum wage, for \nstudents from poor and ethnic households; \nand (iii) concessional credit for students. \nThe ethnic minorities will directly benefit \nfrom increased financial assistance for \nsecondary and tertiary education. Second, \nthe health insurance premium paid on behalf \nof the poor will be increased and a partial \nsubsidy will be extended to the near-poor. \nEthnic minorities will benefit somewhat more \nthan the rest of the population because the \nproportion of the poor and near-poor is \ngenerally higher among ethnic minorities \nthan among the ethnic majority. Health \ninsurance premiums for the poor increased \nin 2008. Near-poor households receive 50% \nhealth insurance subsidy from the \nGovernment.  \n \nSIPRP V covers assistance for health \ninsurance but not education fees. Therefore, \nit has a direct impact on the ethnic minorities \nonly through subsidized health insurance. \nSIPRP V has an indirect effect on the \nreduction of poverty among ethnic minorities \nby supporting other policy reforms.  \n       \nLabor  No Impact  PRSC 7 and SIPRP V support policy areas   \n\u2327 Employment  that will promote business development and  (cid:2) Plan \nopportunities  generate new job opportunities.

These targeted programs \n ", "62  Appendix 9 \nwill benefit directly poor mountain \ncommunes and villages, and eventually poor \nhouseholds.  \n       \nOther Risks  No Impact  Macroeconomic instability and high inflation  (cid:2) Plan \nand/or  have been main concerns since the start of  (cid:2) Other action \nVulnerabilities  2008.

The \nsituation improved in June and July but is \nstill fragile.

The ongoing \ndevelopment of the system, including the refinement \nof indicators and mechanisms for measurement, will \nresult in an improved knowledge base for \nenvironmental issues. \n10.
