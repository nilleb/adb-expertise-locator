INTRODUCTION \n1.  The public administration institutes in the developing member countries (DMCs) of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) are a potentially powerful indigenous advisory resource to \nstrengthen  governance  and  public  management.  This  advisory  resource  has  the  important \nadvantage of being substantially locally sustainable. The institutes can also potentially be very \npowerful  institutional  change  agents  based  on  their  local  knowledge,  acceptability,  and \ninfluence. The performance of these institutes and schools of public administration, however, \nvaries greatly. Strong indigenous institutes exist in India and Malaysia. In other countries such \nas Afghanistan, Central Asian Republics, East Timor and in the Mekong DMCS, much work is \nstill needed to help such institutions become agents of good governance. \n \n2.  A useful strategy in addressing the need for strengthening such institutions is the use of \nnetworks. The need for networks of professionals and institutions is now at the forefront of \npromoting good governance. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \n(OECD) and the Inter-American Development Bank work with such networks of senior public \nadministration  officials.  This  approach  is  in  many  ways  preferable  to  sole  dependence  on \nwestern expertise. If DMCs could turn to existing Asian networks for assistance, supporting \ncapacity-building efforts would become more relevant and meaningful. Regional institutions well \nexperienced  in  the  Asian  cultural  and  financial  environment  and  related  constraints  could \naddress such needs more effectively. If such institutions were linked through an association, it \nwould then become easier to make demands for services from its membership. ADB is already \nmediating these efforts in a modest way, but should capitalize on the opportunity to address this \nissue. \n \n3.  ADB is positioned uniquely to support the establishment of a regional network of such \ninstitutes  in  Asia.  This  is  also  part  of  ADB's  mandated  role  to  catalyze  greater  regional \ncooperation and exchange of good practices for development. \n \n4.  An example of best practices network is the Network of Institutes and Schools of Public \nAdministration in Central and Eastern Europe (NISPACEE), which was founded with initial \nsupport from the Austrian Government and OECD's Sigma Program1 in 1994 with 15 member \ninstitutions.  NISPACEE  has  proved  that  East-to-East  cooperation  for  building  capacity  in \ntransition economies is a viable alternative to purely West-East collaboration. Today, it is a \nthriving network with over 120 members. \n \n5.  The  Eastern  Regional  Organization  for  Public  Administration  (EROPA)  is  the  only \nexisting regional network of public administration institutes in Asia and the Pacific. It currently \ncomprises only 12 members.2 However, EROPA is an intergovernmental organization catering \nto only a very limited number of institutions of its member governments and unable to provide \nservices envisaged by the proposed network under this technical assistance (TA)3 (para. 20). \nThere are no other regional networks in public administration education and training in Asia and \nthe Pacific. \n \n                                                 \n1  The Sigma program is an OECD program, in existence since 1992, funded mainly by the European Union to \nsupport good governance in the Central and Eastern European Countries. As part of its emphasis on building \nindigenous capacity, one of the Sigma program units focused on civil service and training issues and was \ninstrumental in mobilizing interest and donor resources for the NISPACEE Network. \n2  Members of EROPA are Australia, People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Republic of Korea, \nMalaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 2002. ", "2 \n6.  The International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration (IASIA) is an \ninternational  network  that  was  formally  incorporated  in  1971.  IASIA  has  a  worldwide \nmembership of 200 institutions in 70 countries of which 30 are in 13 Asia and Pacific countries.4 \nWith headquarters in Brussels, it is affiliated with the International Institute of Administrative \nStudies (IIAS). The activities of IASIA members include education and training of administrators \nand managers, and related research, consulting, and publications. IASIA is a clearinghouse for \nregional and national associations throughout the world concerned with public administration \neducation and training. Its worldwide membership provides organizations from various parts of \nthe  world,  having  the  same  concerns,  with  the  opportunity  to  consider  and  advance  their \ninterests from a global perspective. This capacity makes mutual support and assistance more \npossible and helps serve the needs arising from the increasingly international nature of the \nenvironment in which governments and their public services are called on to operate. It also \nfacilitates initiatives that may enhance the institutional and operational effectiveness of member \norganizations and of the public sector internationally. Due to its affiliation with IIAS, IASIA can \nalso make use of research fellows and the extensive reference library of IIAS, thereby providing \na wide array of information. \n \n7.  IASIA  holds  annual  conferences  and  is  supportive  of  regional  associations.  A \npresentation related to launching a possible network for the Asia and Pacific region was made \nat  the  last  IASIA  conference  during  a  session  devoted  to  regional  cooperation.  Potential \nparticipants from the region enthusiastically endorsed the need for such a Network during the \nconference.5  At this meeting, the Korea Institute of Public Administration and the National \nSchool of Administration of the People\u2019s Republic of China argued the need for this network and \nsignaled that they were eager to lead this process together with ADB. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n8.  Governance,  and  more  specifically  public  administration,  has  become  a  priority \ndevelopment concern for most DMCs in the region. It is one of the key strategic objectives of \nADB. External assistance for governance and capacity building to DMCs has generally taken \nthe form of studies, training, placement of advisors, budget support related to conditionalities, \netc.  Most  such  interventions  have  had  difficulty  in  achieving  the  sustained  building  of \ngovernance capacity. It appears necessary to complement them with the building of indigenous \ngovernance advisory capacity and to encourage local solutions to the major deficiencies of \npublic management and the delivery of basic services. \n \n9.  Asia and the Pacific covers a wide geographic range, with countries of varied political \nsystems. Established democracies, monarchies, small island states, and so-called \u201ctransition \neconomies\u201d in the process of changing from a command to a socialist market economy dot the \nlandscape. Most of the countries, except the very small ones including most of the island states \nof  the  Pacific,  have  institutions  dedicated  to  educating  and  training  citizens  in  public \nadministration. Some of these institutions are recent; some are in transition themselves; and a \ncertain number are well-established solid institutions with a proud history, strong administrative \nculture, and reputable teaching. \n \n                                                 \n4  Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, Thailand and Viet \nNam are ADB DMCs with one or more institutional members. \n5  J.

Saldanha. 2002. \u201cBuilding Capacity for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific: A \nProposal to Network Public Administration Schools and Institutes,\u201d Paper presented to the Annual Conference of \nthe International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration, Istanbul, Turkey, 17-20 June. \n ", "    3 \n10.  The Asian crisis of 1997 showed the degree to which the region is vulnerable in its \nmarch towards economic growth and development. The more developed countries also suffered \nfrom this crisis. Lack of good public management and related training may have played a role. \nStrengthening  of  the  public  service  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  is  key  to  growth  because,  as \ncountries  move  more  and  more  towards  degrees  of  liberalized  economies,  the  regulatory \nfunction of government becomes crucial for success.  \n \n11.  In the less developed countries, weaker public administration institutions have limited \nmeans to access consistent and long-term support for reform save for the odd participation in a \ndevelopment project. If one considers geography in the subregions, there are countries where \nmany similarities exist, both historic and systemic. For example, the Central Asian republics are \noften characterized by their Soviet past, overcentralized systems, and degrees of linguistic and \nreligious commonalties. The countries of the Mekong subregion are experimenting with a mixed \npolitical  system,  which  keeps  political  control  within  the  state  apparatus  while  bringing  in \nelements of market. In South Asia, extensive moves are afoot to open economies further, in \npace with emerging economies in East and Southeast Asia such as Malaysia and Thailand. In \neach  subregion,  the  similarities  militate  for  some  degree  of  regional  cooperation  in  public \nadministration education in order to capitalize on regionally available capacity and respond to \nmarket efficiency. There is a need to complement project-based capacity development with the \nbuilding of indigenous governance/public administration advisory capacity, and to encourage \nlocal and regional solutions to the major deficiencies of public administration. \n \n12.  Most aid to such educational and training institutions has taken the technology transfer \napproach. When the aid is bilateral, staff of institutions have been awarded study visits to learn \nthe ways of the aid-providing country. Multilateral aid, when occurring, has simply provided \nmore  choice  in  a  similar  process.  The  net  result  often  has  been  the  transference  of \ninappropriate technologies and public management models, and nonsustainable development \nas the learning, skills, and capacity tend to disappear when an aid agency\u2019s program ends. Little \nattempt  has  been  made  to  tie  the  development  of  public  administration  institutions  to  the \ndevelopment of the civil service and the budget process. There is a need in Asia and the Pacific \nas a region and in its subregions for networking institutions to obtain better synergy, save effort, \nand sustain long-term viability. \n \n13.  It is essential that ADB, as the premier development agency of the region, represent the \nregion and its interests in various regional and global bodies, because such bodies play a \nsignificant role in key development issues. Through association with existing and new networks, \nADB can ensure that the needs and views of the DMCs are adequately publicized, and benefits \nfrom these bodies and networks accrue appropriately to the DMCs. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The long-term goal of the TA is to enhance the capacities of the public administration \ninstitutes of DMCs and their contribution to making government in DMCs more efficient and \neffective. This can be effectively and efficiently achieved through more regional institutes and \nschools of public administration assisting each other with locally tested best practices. \n \n15.  The  immediate  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  put  in  place  a  network  for  the  public \nadministration  institutes  of  DMCs,  particularly  with  regard  to  (i)  identifying  potential  DMC ", "4 \nmembers for this network, (ii) building the network\u2019s ability to provide effective capacity-building \nservices to member institutes on a sustainable basis, (iii) encouraging sharing of expertise and \ngood  practice  among  members  of  the  network,  and  (iv)  identifying  potential  sources  of \nsustainable financing. \n \n16.  Expected outputs are: \n \n(i)  a regionwide public administration forum as a first step to establishing an Asia \nand  Pacific  network  of  public  administration  institutes  and  schools,  and \ndeveloping a related action plan with tangible outputs and outcomes; \n(ii)  implementation  of  the  agreed  upon  action  plan  over  an  18-month  period, \nincluding launching the network; \n(iii)  establishment of a secretariat for the network that will be the catalyst for (a) \nmanaging the network, and (b) disseminating best public administration good \npractices of the region to member institutions; and  \n(iv)  election of a steering group to give strategic direction to the network. \n \n17.  The TA framework is outlined in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  To  launch  the  network,  a  list  of  key  institutions  involved  in  public  administration \neducation, training, and research in DMCs, with emphasis on discerning the more established \nand stronger institutions, will be established. IASIA will help ADB in identifying these institutions. \nDuring this phase a few key institutions may be identified to help start up the network process \nalong with ADB. The final choices will be made by ADB, and the process will be solely led by \nADB. \n \n19.  Interested Institutions will be invited to a regionwide forum to establish the network; \nagree on its mission, structure and operating principles; and select a steering group to produce \nthe by-laws. A secretariat will also be established. These activities will be organized and led by \nADB. \n \n20.  Based on the outcomes of the initial forum, the steering group and secretariat will decide \nwhich of the following activities will be provided to the membership in the first instance, with the \nunderstanding that the network will eventually supply its membership with all or most of these \nactivities: \n \n(i)  hold regional or subregional meetings whenever appropriate, \n(ii)  exchange staff within the region, \n(iii)  exchange students within the region, \n(iv)  host staff from outside the region, \n(v)  hold seminars for staff development (consultation skills), \n(vi)  establish relations with other regional networks, \n(vii)  create working groups to undertake specific research activities, \n(viii)  inform members via a newsletter, \n(ix)  have a publication program, \n(x)  improve relations with external aid agencies, \n(xi)  develop a database of regional resources, \n(xii)  produce an electronic journal, \n(xiii)  raise funds, ", "    5 \n(xiv)  train researchers, and \n(xv)  work on educational/training/consultancy projects. \n \n21.  Sustainability of such a network is very important. Recent experience from NISPACEE \nshows that, with a proactive secretariat, flexible structure and motivated steering committee, it is \npossible to become self-sustainable by attracting external interest while undertaking useful \nresearch  and  training  tasks  on  a  regional  basis.  Once  the  secretariat  is  established  and \nsupported  to  obtain  necessary  funding,  ADB  will  not  make  future  financing  commitments. \nPreliminary contacts suggest a motivated potential membership, but risks exist if the interest \ncannot be mobilized over time into an active network. However, experience with NISPACEE \nindicates that sustainability risks can be substantially minimized. ADB will work with potential aid \nagencies and the network steering committee and secretariat to help obtain necessary funding \nto make the Network sustainable using the NISPACEE experience as model. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n22.  The total cost of the TA is $300,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The TA will be implemented by the Governance and Regional Cooperation Division. Aid \nagencies  and  other  regional  public  administration  networks  will  be  consulted.  Participating \nDMCs\u2019 concurrence with the TA will be obtained on a no-objection basis. \n \n24.  The detailed terms of reference of the TA consultants are in Appendix 3. All consultants \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. The TA \nwill require 8 person-months of international and 18 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices.  IASIA  will  be  directly  selected  (Section  6.13  of  the  Guidelines)  to  carry  out  the \ninternational consulting services. The domestic consultants will be engaged as individuals. \nIASIA will undertake the initial tasks of the TA, in particular the achievement of Output 1 \nidentified in para. 16. IASIA is the only international association of its kind, and has had \nsignificant experience in the establishment of networks for public administration institutions. It is \ntherefore best placed to assist ADB in establishing the database of institutions in the region, \nmaking initial contacts, and managing the regionwide public administration forum as a first step \nto starting up the network. IASIA will also benefit from and rely upon NISPACEE and its \nexperience.   \n \n25.  The TA activity will begin on 1 December 2002 and be completed by 30 November 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Network of Public Administration Institutes of the Asia and Pacific Region, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.
