In line with the Tenth Five-Year Plan\u2019s focus on governance, including the need to \ndecongest  the  courts  and  speed  up  sustainable  delivery  of  and  access  to  justice,  the \nGovernment  of  India  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical \nassistance (TA) in 2003 for a sector and diagnostic study on administration of justice. A TA \nproject on administration of justice was included in ADB\u2019s 2003 Country Strategy and Program \nfor India. An ADB fact-finding mission visited New Delhi in April-May 2003 and had detailed \ndiscussions with the national and Delhi governments, members of the judiciary, and other \nstakeholders on the purpose and output, methodology and key activities, cost estimates and \nfinancing, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA.1 The TA framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Under the Constitution, the Supreme Court is the apex court. The high courts are \nimmediately subordinate to the Supreme Court in terms of judicial function. Among the union \nterritories, only Delhi has a high court. The Constitution does not give the Supreme Court \nadministrative control over the high courts. The high court\u2019s administrative control is vested in \nthe chief justice of the high court, who can delegate such control to a registrar of the high court. \nAdministrative control may, in turn, be delegated within the court registry. Subordinate civil \ncourts  generally  include  district  courts,  city  civil  courts,  and  small-causes  courts.  The \nsubordinate  criminal  courts  generally  include  session  courts  and  courts  of  judicial  and \nmetropolitan magistrates. Special courts and tribunals and quasi-judicial forums also exist.2 \n \n3.  The location and structure of the Delhi courts would enable a state-level analysis of legal \nand judicial sector needs if a sector and  diagnostic study were conducted. First, since the \nSupreme Court and Delhi High Court are close to each other, Supreme Court initiatives\u2019 \ncompatibility with the appellate jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court can be easily examined. \nSecond,  as  the  Delhi  High  Court  has  original  side  jurisdiction,3  examination  of  those \nexperiences for the subordinate judiciary in Delhi is relevant. Third, as key parts of the executive \nbranch of the national and Delhi governments and the Delhi courts are close to each other, they \ncan easily and continuously monitor and review the study. Fourth, as the national and Delhi \ngovernments are close to each other, resource allocation processes for the Delhi courts can be \neasily and comprehensively analyzed.4 Fifth, the analytical expertise and experience of entities \nsuch as the Law Commission of India will also be important for the study. \n \n4.  The national Government, Supreme Court, and Delhi courts have attempted to reduce \ncourt  congestion  and  delays  through  initiatives  ranging  from  introduction  of  information \ntechnology to setting up fast-track courts. However, unlike the Supreme Court,5 high and \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 May 2003. \n2  Special courts include the Central Bureau of Investigation Court. Quasi-judicial forums include the Central \nAdministration Tribunal,  debt recovery tribunals,  Telecom Disputes Settlement Tribunal, and Appellate Tribunal. \n3 Not every high court has original side jurisdiction (meaning the hearing in the first instance of a matter over a \nparticular pecuniary value). \n4 While the salaries and administrative expenses of the Delhi High Court and subordinate courts are a charge on the \nConsolidated Fund of the State, all additional funds have to be voted by the State Assembly and coursed through \nthe Law Department of the State. The national Government also has allocations, such as for the 1,734 fast-track \ncourts, which are administratively allocated by the national DOJ.  \n5 As of 1 November 2002 the Supreme Court had only 24,381 pending cases, down by 80% from 104,936 on 31 \nDecember 1991. ", "2  \nsubordinate courts have a large number of pending cases.6 While neither the Delhi High Court \nnor subordinate courts have the most cases pending, their numbers are substantial.7 While not \nunmanageable, they highlight the need for a sector and diagnostic study to set targets and \nrealistic indicators to reduce delay. The courts, lawyers, and litigants also face the challenge of \nthe magnitude of government litigation. These challenges make the Delhi court system an \nappropriate subject of a sector and diagnostic study. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n5.  The objectives of the TA are to help (i) reduce Delhi court congestion and (ii) develop \nsustainable improvements in delivery of and access to speedy justice. The TA will help the \nnational Government carry out a sector and diagnostic study of the legal and judicial sector, \nfocused on Delhi courts, lawyers, and citizens, to identify needs and measures to reduce court \ncongestion and delays. Such measures will be capable of being pilot-tested and implemented in \nthe Delhi court system.8 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n6.  The TA will comprise an empirical analysis of data collected from the national and Delhi \ngovernments, and the courts; and a review of secondary analyses, surveys, workshops, and \nconsultations under three components. They will build on a review of the overall analysis of \ndomestic initiatives and reports, and comparative international reports from other common-law \njurisdictions; and make recommendations, including procedures and rules, to implement them. \n \n  1.    Part A : Court Systems Modernization  \n \n7.  The component is composed of the following subcomponents:  \n \n(i)   Court Budget System. Improve (a) sources and quantum of court budgets, \nrevenue, and expenditure, including court fees, fines, and earmarked funds, and \n(b)  preparation,  planning,  and  management  of  such  budgets,  revenue,  and \nexpenditure. \n \n(ii)   Court Human Resource System.  (a) Identify administration needs, including \nstaffing, performance, accountability, evaluation, professional court management, \nand training needs of registries and law clerks. (b) Improve case and docket \nmanagement  and  alternate  dispute  resolution.  (c)  Identify  judicial  needs, \nincluding staffing, continuing education, performance, accountability, evaluation, \nbenches, and assignments. \n \n(iii)    Court  Infrastructure  and  Statistical  Management  System.  (a)  Identify \ninformation  technology  needs  and  address  attendant  issues  of  phasing, \n                                                 \n6 As of 31 March 2002 the various high courts had pending cases of 3.55 million, an increase of 30% from 2.65 \nmillion as of 31 December 1993. The subordinate courts had 20.75 million cases pending as of 31 December 2002. \n7 As of 31 December 2002 the Delhi High Court had 91,132 pending cases, and Delhi subordinate courts had \n689,832. \n8 The Delhi courts to be examined under the sector and diagnostic study of the TA will include the Delhi High Court \nand selected Delhi civil and criminal subordinate courts, but not tribunals, and quasi-judicial forums. ", "  3\ncoordination,  and  management.9  (b)  Identify  physical  infrastructure  needs, \nincluding court buildings and physical facilities for witnesses. (c) Identify the \nneeds of a system of retrieval, collection, and reporting of judicial statistics, \nincluding case tracking, record keeping, case assignments, and classification \nunder different court procedures, categories, and groupings. \n \n  2.    Part B : Legal Profession Capacity Building  \n \n8.  This component will examine (i) needs of legal and continuing legal education,10 and (ii) \nneeds related to the governing regulations of the legal profession to provide and maintain \nquality legal services in Delhi.  \n \n  3.    Part C : Public Access to Justice \n \n9.  This  component  will  recommend  ways  to  improve  marginalized  litigants\u2019  access  to \njustice by identifying the needs of (i) public information systems for legal rights, including legal \nliteracy  and  empowerment;  (ii)  institutional  systems  for  public  access  to  courts,  including \nadministrative  procedures  to  review  reduction  of  government  litigation,  performance  of \ngovernment legal services and legal aid services, use of alternate dispute resolution to reduce \ngovernment  litigation,  and  use  of  paralegals;  and  (iii)  procedures  and  rules  required  to \nimplement the recommendations.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n10.  The TA is estimated at $625,000, of which $422,500 is the foreign exchange cost and \n$202,500 equivalent is the local currency cost. The entire foreign exchange cost and $77,500 \nequivalent of the local currency cost will be financed on a grant basis from the Government of \nthe United Kingdom. The Government will provide a total of $125,000 equivalent to finance part \nof the local currency costs to cover counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, and \nother expenses. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The executing agency for the TA will be the Department of Justice (DOJ), Ministry of \nHome Affairs. The national Government through the Ministry  of Law and Justice (MOLJ), in \nconsultation with the chief justice of India and chief justice of the Delhi High Court, will establish \na steering committee of no more than five members to be chaired by a justice of the Supreme \nCourt and including representatives of the Delhi High Court, national and Delhi governments, \nand a distinguished member of the bar to closely monitor, coordinate, undertake stakeholder \nconsultations, and direct as necessary all activities under the TA. The composition of the \nsteering committee will be undertaken in consultation with ADB. DOJ, through the national and \nDelhi governments, the courts, and, where necessary, the steering committee, will ensure that \ncounterpart staff and all data and information are available to consultants to carry out the TA. A \nsenior DOJ official will be designated as project director of an administration of justice unit for \nthe TA. Apart from the unit, at least one senior official from the registry of the Delhi High Court \n                                                 \n9 Phasing involves examination of court facilities, procedures, training, and sequencing that need to accompany the \nintroduction of information technology; coordination, the compatibility of automation, for example, with the Supreme \nCourt;  and  technology  management,  the  most  effective  means  of  automation  and  information  technology \nmanagement. \n10 The legal profession is a source of appointments to the bench for the high and subordinate courts (Article 217, \nConstitution of India; and Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules 1970). ", "4  \nwill be required to help the consultants. ADB and the national Government will implement the \nTA using a participatory approach, conferring with leading legal practitioners, judges, and other \nstakeholders who can and wish to contribute to the sector and diagnostic study.  \n \n12.  All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. \n \n13.  ADB will recruit a team to provide consulting services for a total of 37 person-months: \n14.5  person-months  by  international  consultants  and  22.5  person  months  by  domestic \nconsultants. Expertise required will be in the fields of (i) court statistical and budget systems, (ii) \nprofessional court management and case management, (iii) court infrastructure and information \ntechnology systems management, (iv) judicial and legal education and training, and (v) access \nto  justice.
