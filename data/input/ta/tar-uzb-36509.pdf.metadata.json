The Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan (the Government) requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for assistance to improve woman and child health (WCH) in July \n2002. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission of November 2002 and the joint ADB-World Bank Project \nPreparation  Coordination  Mission  of  January  2003  agreed  with  the  Government  on  the \nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA).1  \n \n2.  The World Bank, active in the health sector in the country since 1998, supports the \nprimary health care (PHC) initiative in selected oblasts through the Health-1 Project (1998\u2013\n2003). Under the Health-2 Project (2004\u20132008), the World Bank plans to extend the PHC \ninitiative to additional oblasts, and support the Government\u2019s health sector reform (HSR) related \nto PHC. However, the World Bank is unable to allocate sufficient resources to support PHC \ninitiatives countrywide, or to address all the emerging health priorities of the Government. \n \n3.  As  PHC  is  the  primary  goal  of  the  Government,  an  integral  part  of  health  service \ndelivery, and an essential link for addressing WCH concerns, ADB and the World Bank agreed \nwith the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop parallel and complementary projects. The parallel \nprojects have a clearly defined geographical and functional split, with the \u201ccore\u201d components of \nboth  projects  to  concentrate  on  WCH  through  PHC.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  proposed  WCH \ndevelopment project will address the strengthening of first referral networks for WCH, and take \nthe lead in WCH-related HSR initiatives. (Appendix 1 includes the project framework). Given \nthat ADB and the World Bank have similar preparation timelines and objectives, coordinated \npreparation of the core project elements in 2003 will ensure consistent and complementary \nproject design. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Health, Nutrition, and Population Status. Until the early 1990s, health indicators for \nwomen and children in Uzbekistan were relatively better than in other Central Asian republics. \nHowever, deteriorating health-indicators lead to concerns that Uzbekistan may not reach the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).2  For  example,  the  officially  estimated  maternal \nmortality ratio (MMR) of 34 per 100,000 live births in 20003 has not improved since 1994. In \naddition,  oblasts  report  wide  disparities  in  MMR.  Despite  many  antenatal  care  visits  and \nhospital-based deliveries, the foremost causes of maternal deaths are pregnancy complications, \nmost of which are preventable. Although, the officially reported infant mortality rate (IMR) shows \na declining trend since 1992, reaching about 19 per 1,000 live births by 2000,4 the estimation \ntechniques are inconsistent with international definition. Further, effort will be required to sustain \nthe momentum of decline, as almost 50% of infant deaths occur in the neonatal stage, and \nsuggest  attention  for  maternal  and  perinatal  care.  Malnutrition  (19%  underweight)  among \nchildren under 5 is high and above the subregional average, with rates in the lower income \nquintile at least twice that in the upper income quintile. In addition, despite high immunization \ncoverage, the country reports increasing incidences of communicable diseases. With a total \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in November 2002. \n2  MDGs: Maternal mortality ratio, child mortality rate, births attended by skilled professionals, child malnutrition. \n3  Source: Government of Uzbekistan. A study estimated MMR as 60 per 100,000 live births in 1995. \n4  Source: Government of Uzbekistan. The IMR may not compare to international standards given the definition of \nlive birth or perinatal mortality used in the country. The Demographic Health Survey in 1996 placed IMR at 44 per \n1,000 live births, and the Multi-cluster Integrated Survey in 2000 reported IMR at 52 per 1,000 live births. A second \nDemographic Health Survey, conducted in 2002, will produce results that are more recent in 2003. \n ", "2  \nfertility rate of 2.4 births per woman, total population of 24.8 million in 2001, and almost 38% of \nthe population under the age of 15 years, the country will be faced by a high demand for health \ncare among children and women in the coming several years.  \n \n5.  General revenues are the main source of financing Government health expenditures. \nAfter independence, in addition to overall decline in the gross domestic product (GDP), public \nsector resources for health declined from 4.6% to 3.4% of GDP (1990\u20131998).5 Private sector \nhealth expenditure share increased, (ranging between 0.3% and 1.6% of GDP), and contributed \nto 15% (1998) of total health expenditures. Of total government expenditures, 10% are allocated \nfor health;6 and although the share of recurrent expenditure is high, personnel remuneration \nshare in the budget has almost doubled since 1995.7 Resources are allocated based on inputs, \nsuch as beds, population, and staff. While, central level retains funds for tertiary and specialized \nfacilities, districts are responsible for investment and maintenance of lower-level facilities. \n \n6.  The Government introduced the HSR program in 1996, with concentrated efforts toward \nimproving PHC for the rural population. In 1998, the Government adopted a comprehensive \nreform agenda to improve equity in access to quality and affordable health care. The specific \nagenda for WCH included (i) improving PHC services for WCH, (ii) integrating WCH facilities, \n(iii) implementing a safe motherhood initiative, (iv) establishing WCH screening and diagnostic \ncenters, (v) setting up medical genetics centers for WCH, and (vi) restructuring and improving \nthe quality of pediatric services. In 2002, the Government endorsed a series of long-term state \nprograms  for  WCH,  such  as  integrated  management  of  childhood  illnesses,  the  safe \nmotherhood initiative, promotion of breastfeeding, micronutrient deficiency control (primarily iron \nand iodine), and family planning. This has been a step in the right direction; however, many of \nthe  programs  are  not  widely  distributed  in  the  country,  are  insufficiently  integrated  or \ninadequately budgeted for, and are supported solely by international agencies. Overall, the \ncountry is making some progress in improving WCH, although continued effort is required to \naccelerate the reform. \n \n7.  Health  Service  Delivery.  The  Government  promotes  WCH  through  PHC.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  rationalization  program  proposed  collapsing  the  vertical  eight-tiered  health \ninfrastructure into a three-tier system of primary-, secondary-, and tertiary-level facilities by \n2005. The reform was initiated by integrating the three lower level rural facilities8 into one PHC \nfacility, the rural doctoral point (SVP). However, the SVP program is not countrywide, primarily \nbecause  of  slow  construction  and  rehabilitation,  inadequate  equipment  and  supplies,  and \noutdated PHC staff retraining programs. The SVPs offer preventive and basic curative care for \nthe population; however, availability and quality of services varies. The program on integrated \nmanagement of childhood illnesses is not offered widely. In addition, although, certain aspects \nof reproductive health, such as antenatal care and family planning services are integrated, other \naspects, such as delivery and perinatal care, are not integrated in the reformed PHC program.  \n \n8.  The Government supports the rationalization and integration of WCH facilities. Little \nrationalization  has  however  taken  place  beyond  first  level  of  outpatient  care  under  PHC. \nCurrently,  WCH  services  are  fragmented  and  particularly  limited  at  the  SVP\u2014most  WCH \nservices are now offered at hospital levels. Central district (rayon) hospitals, which are an \nintegral  part  of  the  PHC  network,  offer  specialized  ambulatory  care,  and  maternity  wards. \n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 2002. Uzbekistan, Living Standards Assessment: Health, Nutrition, and Population. Washington, DC. \n6  European Observatory, 2000. \n7 Government of Uzbekistan, 2001. \n8  In larger oblasts, where access is more difficult, some lower level facilities have been retained. \n ", "3 \nDelivery hospitals, which are for maternal care, offer services for normal deliveries, but little \nscope for care of complicated deliveries and high-risk neonates, and limited exposure to safe \nmotherhood  and  baby  friendly  hospital  initiatives.  In  addition,  standards,  guidelines,  and \nprotocols of service delivery are not fully developed. The oblast or next referral hospitals, \ntherefore accommodate delivery complications, although referral protocols remain weak. WCH \nrationalization and a WCH service integration plan are needed within a wider health systems \nframework. \n \n9.  The  country  lacks  appropriate  hematology9  and  laboratory  services.  There  is  little \npossibility to provide blood transfusion in emergencies such as pregnancy-related hemorrhage \nor  severe  anemia.  Screening  of  transfusion-transmissible  infectious  diseases  is  far  from \nsystematic, and preparation of blood product is weak. The stock of blood available at the \nnational level is low. No strategic plan for hematology currently exists. Further direction is \nrequired on the needs for hematology and laboratory services for WCH. \n \n10.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  the  skills  of  specialists  (obstetricians, \ngynecologists,  and  pediatricians),  general  practitioners  (GPs),  nurses,  and  midwives. \nConsequently, a new curriculum was approved for GP undergraduate education, and a program \nwas developed for retraining SVP doctors as GPs.10 In addition, recent efforts have introduced \nretraining of GPs on safe motherhood and prenatal care.11 Nurses play a critical role in WCH \nand in PHC; however, the nursing profession holds a low status in society and its roles are not \nwell  defined.  Although  the  Government  has  plans  to  improve  higher  education  for  nurse \nspecialists, little or no emphasis has been given for training of general or family nurses for \nPHC12 and WCH. Obstetricians and pediatricians are not trained in the modern curriculum of \ninternational standards, and therefore, often use outdated procedures and protocols. \n \n11.  The key bilateral funding agencies involved in the health sector are the United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  primarily  through  the  regional  project \nZdravPlus, Project Hope, and humanitarian assistance; Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA); the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID); and Germany\u2019s \nKreditanstalt  f\u03cbr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW).  Multilateral  agencies  include  the  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, United Nations Population Fund, World Bank, and World Health Organization. \n \n12.  Uzbekistan is falling behind in achieving the MDGs, especially in reducing infant and \nmaternal  mortality.  Complications  of  pregnancy  and  childbirth,  most  of  which  are  easily \npreventable, are the leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age. A \nconsiderable burden of disease among children below age 5 is attributable to conditions directly \nassociated with poor maternal health and nutrition, and quality and management of pregnancy, \ndelivery, and newborn care. The health care needs can be provided by PHC, and by a strong \nreferral network. The adequate financing of such interventions requires public sector support. \nTargeting interventions on the health care of the poor could therefore have substantial beneficial \neffect, and help the country achieve the MDGs.  \n                                                 \n9  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (United States of America) assessed hematology and blood \ntransfusion services in Uzbekistan in 2001.  \n10  United Kingdom Department for International Development and Health-1 introduced a retraining program for GP in \na few oblasts. While efforts are expected to continue under Health-2, specific training for WCH issues needs to be \nintegrated in the GP training program. \n11  Project Hope will develop training materials and train trainers in their project sites, targeting obstetricians and \ngynecologists at district and oblast hospitals. The curriculum is on safe motherhood and prenatal care training. \n12  DFID and Health-1 introduced a patronage nurses short retraining program with limited coverage. Patronage \nnurses conduct systematic home visits. Recently, ZdravPlus initiated a patronage nurses retraining program in \nFergana oblast with basic training on prevention, counseling, and initial patient assessment at the community level. \n ", "4  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  One of the health sector goals of Uzbekistan is to achieve the MDGs of reduced infant \nand maternal mortality. This proposed Project therefore aims to support the Government\u2019s HSR \nstrategy for WCH. The Project\u2019s overall objective is to improve the equity in access to quality \nand cost-effective WCH services. The Project will assist the Government in refining the WCH \npolicy, and in implementing the most cost-effective and comprehensive strategic programs that \nwill have the largest impact on the target population. On the health service delivery level, the \nProject will support the Government\u2019s PHC program, support the existing SVP model, and assist \nthe Government to develop and implement a district-level model to strengthen PHC referral link \nfor WCH care in selected13 oblasts, with a rural and poverty focus (Appendix 2). The Project \nspecific  objectives  include  (i)  improved  quality  of  cost-effective  PHC  interventions,  (ii) \nstrengthened essential WCH referral mechanisms, and (iii) improved efficiency in health service \ndelivery. The TA will assist MOH in (i) strengthening WCH policy direction, (ii) adopting cost-\neffective health interventions, (iii) rationalizing and integrating the WCH delivery system, and (iv) \nbuilding its capacity for effective management and efficient service delivery.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n14.  The TA has three components: (i) situation analyses; (ii) definition of program objectives, \nstrategies, and interventions; and (iii) preparation of a project design and implementation plan. \nThe  TA  will  be  based  on  discussions,  reviews,  observational  evaluation,  qualitative \nassessments, and secondary data analyses. The TA outputs will be one comprehensive project \ndocument and several technical reports and workshops.  \n \n15.  Situation analyses will include (i) a review of the current WCH policy framework followed \nby the Government; (ii) a needs-assessment for WCH, including health, nutrition, and social and \npoverty status; and (iii) an assessment of the current WCH delivery system, including facilities, \nservices, human resources, training, laboratory, hematology, and referral capabilities.  \n \n16.  The definition of program objectives, strategies, and interventions will include (i) plan of \na  refinement  of  the  WCH  policy,  and  cost-effective  interventions;  (ii)  identification  of  the \nappropriate  WCH  health  delivery  system  (public,  private,  and  community-based),  and  a \nrestructuring and rationalization plan for the public sector; (iii) identification of specific training \nneeds  and  facilities  for  appropriate  WCH  personnel,  including  nurses  and  midwives;  (iv) \nidentification of support services for WCH, including hematology and laboratory; (v) facilitation of \nan effective management information and financing system design; and (vi) development of \nWCH quality control protocols and evidence-based practice guidelines. \n \n17.  The  preparation  of  project  design  and  implementation  plan  will  encompass  (i)  an \neconomic analysis for an appropriate project, an estimation of the cost-needs for WCH care, \nand assessment of budgetary allocation and financial sustainability; (ii) a plan for health facility \nmapping, procurement procedures, and strengthening of implementation; and (iii) a project \nfeasibility report with costs, management structures, monitoring and evaluation systems, and \nimplementation arrangements. \n                                                 \n13  The Project sites will be selected using the following criteria: (i) poverty profile, (ii) relatively poorer maternal \nmortality, (iii) relatively poorer infant mortality, (iv) ADB water project to bring in the complimentary aspects of water \nand health, and (v) activities of other international agencies. Oblasts of focus are tentatively identified as Bukhara, \nKarakalpakstan, Khorezm, and possibly Kashkadarya. \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $769,000 equivalent, of which $426,000 is the \nforeign exchange and $343,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 (65%) equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nof $426,000 and $74,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB \non a grant basis through the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $269,000 (35%), \nthrough  the  provision  of  office  space,  furniture,  counterparts,  and  workshop  facilities.  The \nGovernment has been advised that the approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan of the TA are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will commence in July 2003, and will complete over a period of 6 months in \nDecember 2003. MOH is the Executing Agency. For project preparation, a steering committee \nwill be established to oversee the preparation of the parallel World Bank and ADB health \nprojects. In addition, several working groups are being established, comprising members from \nkey ministries, and international development agencies. Terms of reference are being prepared \nfor the working groups that will prepare working papers on issues and concerns for the Project. \nTo ensure clear coordination during preparation of the World Bank and ADB health projects, an \nADB  TA  administrative  unit  will  be  established  adjacent  to  the  Health-1  Central  Project \nImplementation Bureau (CPIB).  \n \n20.  A team of international (for 13 person-months) and domestic (for 18 person-months) \nconsultants will implement all TA components. The consultants will work closely with ADB, the \nGovernment, the World Bank team preparing Health-2, and with other international development \nagencies.  ADB  will  select  one  local  individual  consultant,  a  social  sector  specialist  (TA \ncoordinator),  for  longer-term  presence,  networking,  and  continuity  in  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment. Another local consultant will be selected for the poverty and social assessment. In \naddition,  ADB  will  engage  a  team  of  consultants  through  an  international  consulting  firm \nfollowing the simplified technical proposal, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, and other arrangements for the selection of the domestic consultants. A quality-\nbased  selection  method  will  be  used,  since  the  TA  will  engage  in  policy  analysis  and \ndevelopment. The consultants with international experience will include the following expertise: \nTA team leader, maternal health care, child health care, human resource development for \nnursing, hematology and laboratory, health economics, and health management information \nsystems. Appendix 4 provides the terms of reference for the consultants. During the TA, the \nteam  will  facilitate  and  coordinate  a  series  of  technical  reports,  secondary  data  analyses, \nreviews, assessments, and qualitative and observational analyses. An inception workshop will \nbe held 2\u20133 weeks after the start of the TA. A midterm report will be presented at a workshop \nabout 6\u20138 weeks from the inception workshop. The draft final report will be technical and \navailable 2 weeks before a final consensus workshop at the end of the TA. The draft final report \nwill be revised, based on comments by the Government, ADB, and the World Bank.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for preparing the Woman and Child Health Development Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nSector Goals       \n\u2022  Millennium  \u2022  MDG: reduce the maternal  \u2022  Household surveys. \nDevelopment Goals  mortality ratio (MMR) by  \u2022  Population census. \n(MDGs): improved  75% in 1990\u20132015; Project  \u2022  Vital registration \nhealth status of  goal: reduce MMR by 40%  statistics. \nwomen and children.  in 2004\u20132009 in project   \n \nsites (MMR=33 in 1991; 34 \n \nin 2000).  \n \n\u2022  MDG: reduce infant \n \nmortality rate (IMR) by 66% \n \nin 1990\u20132015; Project \n \n  goal: reduce IMR by 20% \n  in 2004\u20132009 in project \n  sites (IMR=35 in 1991; 19 \n  in 2000). \n  \u2022  MDG: reduce under 5 \n  mortality rate (U5MR) by \n  66% in 1990\u20132015; Project \n  goal: reduce U5MR by 20% \n  in 2004\u20132009 in project \n \nsites (U5MR=48 in 1991; \n \n35 in 2000). \n \n \n \n\u2022  Improved share for primary \n\u2022  Health Sector Reform \nhealth care (PHC) versus \nGoal: improved \nnon-PHC in Government \nefficiency of health \n(nonsalary recurrent) \nservice delivery. \nexpenditures. \nPurpose/Objective       \n\u2022  Improved equity and  \u2022  Reduced fatality from  \u2022  Household surveys.    \u2022  The Government is \nefficiency to quality  hemorrhage.  \u2022  Facility-based health  committed to improving \nand cost-effective  \u2022  Reduced percent low birth  information system.

A social and poverty assessment will be conducted during project preparation. \nIn Uzbekistan, overall, 27% of the population lives below poverty line, with almost 69% of the poor living in rural \nareas. Past data are not comparable, but the 1996 household poverty incidence is estimated at 21%. The southern \nregion, Kashkadarya and Sukhandarya, reported the worst poverty incidence, followed by the northern region, \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm; together these regions comprise 28% of the country\u2019s population, but over 55% of the \nshare of poor and extreme poor. Kashkadarya oblast reported the worst incidence of poverty and extreme poverty in \nthe country.  \nSome health indicators are influenced by poverty. Poorer income groups are less likely to seek health care. \nWhereas almost 55% individuals in the highest income quartile sought health care, only 44% in the lowest income \nquartile sought health care. The higher income groups are more likely to use secondary/tertiary health facilities \nrelative to the lower income groups, which rely more on outpatient centers and clinics. Individuals from the lowest \nincome groups rely most heavily on primary health care (PHC) facilities. The higher income groups are 30\u201350% more \nlikely to go to the central rayon- polyclinic or hospital or the city- polyclinic or hospital, are more likely to be admitted \nto hospitals, and have longer hospital stays. (Family Income and Expenditure Survey, 1996; World Bank. 2002. \nUzbekistan, Living Standards Assessment: Health, Nutrition, and Population. Washington, DC; Cashin, C. 2001. \nAccess to Health Care in Rural Ferghana Oblast, Uzbekistan. Study prepared by ZdravPlus, USAID, Tashkent). \nThe Project will have a poverty intervention focus. The project sites will be selected using the following criteria: (i) \npoverty profile, (ii) poor maternal mortality and high-risk indicators, (iii) poor infant mortality and high-risk indicators, \n(iv) ADB water project to bring in the complementary aspects of water and health, and (v) activities of other \ninternational agencies. Based on these selection criteria, the oblasts of focus have tentatively been identified as \nBukhara, Karakalpakstan, Khorezm, and possibly Kashkadarya.  \nC.  Participation Process          Participation Strategy Required: Yes.   \nStakeholder analysis:                                                                                          \nProject preparation will include a social and poverty assessment, and a participatory beneficiary and stakeholder \nanalysis, to include the concerns of local authorities, the Mahallah Fund (nongovernmental organization providing \nsocial assistance to communities), community-based organizations, women\u2019s groups, and citizens, and prepare an \nimplementation plan to support capacity building during project implementation.  \nD.  Potential Issues \n  Significant,     \nSubject  Not Significant,  Strategy to  Plan \nUncertain, None  Address Issues  Required \nGender  Not foreseen  Not required.    No \nThe project will (i) focus on women and children\u2019s health care, \n(ii) target in areas with relatively low maternal mortality ratio \n(MMR), (iii) have a human development focus, and (iv) help \ndevelop nurses and midwives. Gender differentials in health \n ", "Appendix 2  9 \noutcome are not significant in the country.   \n Women\u2019s  overall  health  conditions  in  Uzbekistan  are \nrelatively better than in other Central Asian countries. However, \nsince 1994, Uzbekistan has not seen much improvement in its \nMMR. In addition, in-country differentials are noted. MMR in \nBukhara oblast is twice the national average. Anemia among \npregnant  women  is  highest  in  Karakalpakstan  oblast.  In \naddition, pregnant women from rural areas are less likely to \nvisit doctors than nurses, than are women from urban areas.   \nAffordability  Not foreseen  To be assessed in social and poverty analyses.  No \nThe Project will (i) target on the poorer oblasts; (ii) have a \nhuman development focus; (iii) support health financing and \nmanagement reforms; and (iv) assist the Government in health \npersonnel  career  development,  including  incentives  for \nimproving performance of health service providers.  \nGenerally, PHC services have no formal fees at health \nfacilities in the public sector. However, informal payment for \nhealth care is prevalent in Uzbekistan. One household survey \nsuggested that 11\u201330% of those seeking medical consultation \npaid for the services. The poor paid more frequently, as 70% of \nthose among the lowest income quintile paid for health care. In \naddition, according to a household-based study, the poorest \nincome quintile reported spending about 22% of household \nconsumption on health care. (World Bank. 2002. Uzbekistan \nLiving  Standards  Assessment:  Health,  Nutrition,  and \nPopulation. Washington, DC).  \nIndigenous   Not foreseen  To be assessed in social and poverty analyses.   No \nPeople  The  ethnic  minority  groups  generally  have  better  living \nstandards than the Uzbek population. Some differentials in \nhealth outcomes are noted, a result of behavioral differences.  \nLabor  None  Not required.  No \nResettlement  None  Not required.
