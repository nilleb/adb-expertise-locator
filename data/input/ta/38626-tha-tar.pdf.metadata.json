The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved technical assistance (TA) for Capacity \nBuilding  for  Pollution  Taxation  and  Resource  Mobilization  for  Environment  and  Natural \nResource  Sectors.1  The  main  objective  of  the  TA  was  to  identify  and  adapt  suitable \nenvironmental tax policy instruments for Thailand using economic principles and international \nexperience.  This  project  achieved  its  objectives  of  reviewing  international  experience  in \nenvironmental taxation and identifying the fiscal and taxation policy options available to the \nGovernment for dealing with environmental sector. It recommended a framework for pollution \ntaxation in Thailand. The TA report also highlighted the (i) need to further study the roles of \nnational  and  local  levels  of  government  and  line  ministries  pertaining  to  the  design  and \nimplementation of pollution taxation instruments, (ii) appropriate and effective management of \nrevenues collected from such instruments, and (iii) institutional links between taxation and \nrevenue management responsibilities in the context of pollution taxation. \n \n2.  The Government requested a second phase of the project to develop a pollution taxation \nact and detailed enforcement plan, using the outputs of the previous TA. A fact-finding mission \nwas launched 25\u201327 April 2005 and met officials from the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) of the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), Office of Natural Resources Policy and Planning of the Ministry of \nNatural Resources and Environment, and MOF\u2019s Excise Department to discuss and agree on \nproject  concept  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  Government  and  ADB  signed  a \nmemorandum of understanding on 27 June 2005 on the project scope, including the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements. The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Rapid economic growth in recent decades has had adverse environmental impacts in \nThailand, resulting in the unsustainable use of natural resources. Declining water quality and \nquantity, increasing air pollution and associated health problems in urban areas, increasing \nquantities of solid and hazardous waste, degrading coastal zone resources, and reduced forest \ncover indicate the stress on the environment and natural resource base. The annual economic \ncost  of  environmental  degradation  in  Thailand  is  estimated  at  $5  billion\u2013$10 billion.3 \nEnvironmental costs are also reflected in the diminished well-being of the Thai people. For \nexample, air pollution in Bangkok is estimated to cause thousands of premature deaths each \nyear, several million cases of sickness, and costs4 up to 10% of Bangkok residents\u2019 annual \nincome. It has been estimated that urban households without access to safe drinking water \nspend up to 10% of their income to access safe drinking water. The economic benefits of \nimproving urban sanitation and reducing water pollution have been estimated at $9 billion per \nyear.5 \n \n4.   MOF has been examining the possibility of introducing pollution taxation in Thailand, in \nresponse to the negative environmental consequences of economic development. This initiative \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.

The \nGovernment  has  strongly  emphasized  that  both  public  and  private  sectors  should  be \naccountable for the social costs of environmental degradation caused by their activities.   \n \n5.  MOF is currently committed to four strategic objectives in its cabinet-approved four-year \nministerial strategy (FY2005\u2013FY2008).6 One of these objectives is to promote a knowledge-\nbased society, strengthen community ties, and promote a good environment. MOF is intently \nexamining its role in enabling greater use of various economic instruments (i.e., taxes, fees, and \nsurcharges) to enhance environmental management in Thailand. In general, MOF agrees with \nthe polluter-pays and user-pays principles in which polluters are responsible for the cost of \nenvironmental degradation, and users pay for environmental services.  \n \n6.  Existing laws and regulations are inadequate in promoting environmentally responsible \nbehavior by polluters or dealing effectively with other environmental problems. At present, policy \nmeasures  for  environmental  management  in  Thailand  mainly  represent  the  command-and-\ncontrol  approaches.  Under  the  existing  command  and  control  system,  environmental \nmanagement is undertaken as authorized by  various laws such as the Enhancement and \nConservation of National Environmental Quality Act (1992), Thai Water Way Act (1913), The \nRoyal Irrigation Act (1942), Public Health Act (1992), and Public Cleansing and Orderliness Act \n(1992).  In  some  instances,  the  Excise  Tax  Act  (1992)  has  also  been  used  to  support \nenvironmental protection despite limitations. The Government has set up environmental quality, \nemission,  and  performance  standards  under  existing  policies.  The  policy  and  regulatory \nframework relies on fines and penalties to ensure compliance. The effectiveness of monitoring \nand enforcement\u2014a prerequisite for the success of the current approach\u2014is generally low.   \n \n7.  Technological restrictions and uniform standards restrict polluting entities from finding \ncost-effective  methods  for  pollution  abatement.  Economic  instruments  such  as  pollution \ntaxation\u2014unlike standards\u2014provide incentives for polluters to change their behavior, and invest \nin and explore technological improvements that reduce the cost of pollution control. Pollution \ntaxation  generates  revenue  that  can  be  earmarked,  under  suitable  circumstances,  for \ninvestment in environmental improvement. Moreover, pollution taxation can be used as a policy \ntool  for  (i)  improving  the  quality  of  environment  and  natural  resources  and  redressing \nenvironmental  degradation,  (ii)  promoting  sustainable  use  of  limited  and  scarce  natural \nresources, and (iii) encouraging local authorities to undertake increasing responsibility for local-\nlevel environment management.   \n \n8.  Pollution taxation principles can be designed to facilitate the implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s administrative and fiscal decentralization plans and support the national agenda \nin  achieving  sustainable  development.  Since  February  2004,  ADB  has  provided  technical \nassistance to MOF to develop a pollution taxation policy framework. This capacity building \nproject  identified  suitable  pollution  taxation  instruments  for  environmental  management  in \nThailand (Appendix 2). Further legal, institutional, organizational, and economic analyses are \nrequired  to  develop  a  pollution  taxation  act  and  enforcement  framework  for  implementing \npollution  taxation.  Therefore,  this  TA  will  develop  the  legal  framework  and  enforcement \nmechanism for pollution taxation.  \n \n                                                 \n6 Ministry of Finance.  Available: http://strategy.mof.go.th. ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s major impact will be reduced pollution in key sectors such as energy, industry, \nwastewater, solid waste, transport, and tourism. It will also promote sustainable use of natural \nresources such as water, land, forest, coastal resources, and mineral resources through the \napplication of appropriate user-fees. The TA will increase government tax revenues, part of \nwhich will be earmarked for investment in environmental improvements in selected sectors on a \npriority basis.  \n \n10.  The  TA\u2019s  purpose  is  to  develop  an  enabling  legal  and  enforcement  framework  for \nimplementing a pollution taxation policy to enhance the overall condition of the environment and \nensure sustainable use of natural resources for further economic development in Thailand. It will \nalso resolve the issue of decentralizing administrative responsibilities from central to provincial \nauthorities, with respect to pollution taxation. The TA will rationalize and harmonize existing \nlegal instruments, which are scattered among a number of government agencies, to ensure \neffective implementation of the pollution taxation policy in Thailand.  \n \n11.  The major outputs of the TA are (i) documented legal principles of pollution taxation; \n(ii) power  devolution  principles;  (iii)  tax  revenue  management  principles;  (iv)  institutional \nresponsibilities; (v) monitoring requirements; and (vi) rationalized pollution taxation policies, \nplans, and implementation arrangements. These outputs will be used to draft the pollution \ntaxation  act  for  Thailand.  An  additional  TA  output  is  the  built  capacity7  on  (i)  selecting \nappropriate taxation instruments; (ii) determining appropriate tax rates, and (iii) implementing \nand administrating tax policy, revenue management, and allocation of tax revenue on a priority \nbasis for investments in environment improvement and pollution abatement, within relevant \ngovernment agencies. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will undertake legal, institutional, organizational, and further economic analyses \nto develop a feasible pollution taxation plan for key sectors of the Thai economy. Its major focus \nwill be on drafting a pollution taxation act, and developing an enforcement plan and institutional \narrangements. This requires the translation of economic principles recommended in phase I to \nlegal principles, taking into account the (i) role of national and local levels of government, as \nwell  as  line  ministries,  pertaining  to  the  design  and  implementation  of  pollution  taxation \ninstruments;  (ii)  appropriate  and  effective  management  of  revenues  collected  from  such \ninstruments to ensure adequate investment in priority areas for environmental improvements; \n(iii) institutional links between taxation and revenue management responsibilities in the context \nof  pollution  taxation  and  investments  in  environmental  improvements;  (iv)  principles  and \nguidelines for a performance-based revenue allocation; and (v) monitoring requirements to \nensure fiscal discipline in the use of pollution taxation revenue.  Insofar as feasible, these \nprinciples should be based on a review of existing legal and institutional frameworks for pollution \ntaxation  in  countries  such  as  Australia,  Denmark,  Japan,  and  United  States,  which  have \nsuccessfully implemented pollution taxation policies.  \n \n                                                 \n7 The international and national consultant of the TA will provide on-the-job training for the relevant government \nofficers on the design and implementation of pollution taxes.  ", "4     \n13.  The  TA  will  develop  a  detailed  enforcement  plan  for  the  successful  introduction  of \npollution taxation in Thailand. It will identify the best tax instruments, appropriate tax rates, and \nadministrative approaches for selected key environmental sectors, including solid waste, water, \nand energy. The capacity of the relevant line agencies will be built to undertake similar activities \nin other sectors. \n \n14.  The current system of tax collection is scattered among many agencies and does not \nadequately address environmental concerns. The TA will develop a plan for rationalizing and \nharmonizing existing pollution taxation policies, plans, and implementation instruments. The TA \nwill  identify  acceptable  benchmark  and  key  performance  indicators  of  the  pollution  tax \nadministration  to  ensure  effective  tax  collection  and  revenue  management.  The  TA  will \nundertake institutional gap analysis to recommend how to enhance the capacity of relevant \ninstitutions for effective implementation and administration of pollution taxation.    \n \n15.   The TA will use a participatory and consultative approach in designing the pollution \ntaxation act, enforcement plan, and institutional arrangements. The consultation process will \nfocus  on  the  (i)  pollution  taxation  framework  proposed  in  phase  I,  (ii)  institutional  and \nadministrative pollution taxation issues, (iii) pollution tax administration capacity building needs \nof national and local governments, and (iv) devolution of pollution taxation power from national \nto local authorities. Consultation findings will be incorporated to the pollution taxation act and \nenforcement plan to develop an effective plan for pollution tax administration\u2014acceptable to the \nGovernment, public, and other stakeholders. Four consultation workshops will be held, at least \ntwo  of  which  will  be  outside  Bangkok.  In  addition,  a  number  of  local  study  tours  will  be \nundertaken to understand pollution taxation and implementation issues in local government. \n \n16.  Project impacts and outcomes depend on the Parliament of Thailand\u2019s approval of the \ndraft pollution taxation act. One of the possible risks of the proposed project is lack of support \nfor pollution taxation among the business community, which generally believes that pollution \ntaxation  will  make  their  business  less  competitive.  These  two  risks  can  be  minimized  by \nadopting a participatory, consultative, and transparent approach to developing the pollution \ntaxation act. Another risk is the lack of specific data to assess appropriate tax rates\u2014to ensure \nthat tax rate is too high and it becomes an extra burden on business or tax rate is too low to \nchange the behavior of polluters so that pollution abatement will be insufficient. If the necessary \ndata is not available, benefit transfer or other methods will be used to determine appropriate tax \nrates.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $322,000 equivalent, of which $118,500 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $203,500 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $225,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$106,500 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent  to  $97,000,  through  provision  of  office  accommodation,  equipment,  legal  and \neconomic staff, and local communication. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MOF will serve as the Executing Agency and FPO will be the Implementing Agency. \nMOF will supervise implementation of the TA and coordinate with ADB to ensure high-quality \noutput.  The  FPO  director  will  bear  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation  on  the ", "5 \nGovernment side. A full-time administrative staff will be appointed to implement the project. A \nproject office will be established within the FPO office. The FPO director will be responsible for \nsubmission of biannual progress reports to ADB, prepared by the project team leader. FPO will \nprovide  legal  and  economic  staff  to  work  in  collaboration  with  the  consultant  as  well  as \nequipment, local travel, and communication facilities. An ADB officer will undertake at least \nthree reviews\u2014at inception, midterm, and the final stage of the project. The midterm review will \nbe undertaken through a review mission and the other two reviews will be carried out using \nelectronic media and written review reports. Relevant project documents will also be subjected \nto review by a technical advisory committee, including staff from the Environment and Social \nSafeguard Division of ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department, the Office of \nthe General Counsel, and MOF. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months beginning November 2005. The proposed \nproject requires the input of 6.7 person-months of international consultants and 12.4 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants, workshops and seminars, local study tours, counterpart staff \nsupport, office space, communication facilities, and equipment. Consultants will be recruited on \nan individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nWorkshops  and  seminars  will  be  conducted  to  present  the  pollution  taxation  approach  to \nstakeholders and receive feedback. Study tours will examine institutional gaps, enforcement \nproblems,  and  other  related  issues  at  the  provincial  level\u2014to  understand  the  feasibility  of \ndevolution of pollution control responsibility.

The  Government  of  Thailand  has  been  reviewing  its  tax  and  subsidy  structures  to \nimprove the performance of the environment and natural resources sectors, with the objectives \nof  enhanced  environmental  management  and  increased  tax  revenues.  The  Government \nrequested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance for an advisory technical assistance (TA) \nto develop a pollution taxation framework to fulfill these objectives. In response to this request, \nADB  granted  small-scale  TA  of  $60,000  for  Capacity  Building  for  Pollution  Taxation  and \nResource Mobilization for Environment and Natural Resource Sectors.1 The main objectives of \nthis TA were to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and relevant line \nagencies to (i) design and implement a pollution taxation policy plan, and (ii) mobilize and \nallocate resources to improve the management of Thailand\u2019s environment and natural resources \nsectors. \n \n2.  The TA undertook (i) a review of global, regional, and Thai experiences in applying \neconomic  instruments  for  environmental  management  and  the  sustainable  use  of  natural \nresources; (ii) a review of centralized and decentralized pollution taxation policy development \nand  implementation;  (iii)  diagnostic  assessment  of  rationalization/harmonization  of  existing \nnational pollution taxation policies, plans, and implementation instruments focusing on pollution \ntaxation  in  the  environment,  water  resources,  industry,  and  energy  sectors;  and \n(iv) identification,  refinement,  and  prioritization  of  suitable  national  pollution  taxation  policy \noptions and instruments. Thus, the TA developed broader economic principles and guidelines \nfor a pollution taxation policy in Thailand. \n \n3.  The TA undertook the necessary groundwork to implement a pollution taxation policy \nboth at national and decentralized local levels in Thailand. However, its attempt to develop a \nroad map for implementation of pollution taxation and examine the legal implications of the \nproposed pollution taxation policy had limited success\u2014mainly due to limited resources. In \naddition to the development of broader economic principles for pollution taxation, the TA built \nconfidence  within  MOF  for  ADB  assistance  to  Thailand  for  the  environment  and  natural \nresources sectors. In this context, the Government seeks further assistance to proceed with \ndrafting a pollution taxation act. Phase II of the project will undertake the necessary legal, \ninstitutional, organizational, and further economic analyses to develop the pollution taxation act. \nIt  will  also  build  the  capacity  necessary  within  line  agencies  and  undertake  stakeholder \nconsultations to ensure broader acceptance of the pollution taxation policy. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.
