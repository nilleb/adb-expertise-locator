INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Indonesia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to\nprovide  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  develop  a  TA  loan  for  local\ngovernments and local government enterprises to finance consultancy services for soliciting\nprivate sector participation (PSP) in urban infrastructure projects. ADB fielded a TA fact-finding\nmission to Jakarta, Medan, Yogjakarta, and Mataram in August 2001 to formulate the TA.1 The\nmission  included  discussions  with  representatives  of  the  central  Government,  local\ngovernments,  associations  of  local  governments  and  water  enterprises,  external  support\nagencies,  state  banks,  and  consultants  working  in  the  urban  infrastructure  sector.  The\nobjectives, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms\nof  reference  for  the  TA  were  agreed  with  the  Government,  and  a  memorandum  of\nunderstanding was signed. The preliminary project framework reflecting goals and purposes of\nthe proposed TA loan project is attached as Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In 1999 the Government passed legislation to support regional autonomy. These laws\ncame into effect on 1 January 2001. Law 22/1999 on Regional Governance and Law 25/1999\non  Fiscal  Balance  Between  the  Central  Government  and  the  Regions  devolved  the\nresponsibility for local infrastructure and service provision to local governments. At the same\ntime  the  level  of  direct  central  Government  support  was  reduced.  While  implementing\nregulations and guidelines have not yet been fully developed, local governments are now in\ncharge of planning, financing, and managing their own investment and service priorities. The\nbacklog in the delivery of urban infrastructure and services is substantial, and the demand\ncontinues to grow rapidly. However, local governments lack the capacity and the financial\nresources to manage all these responsibilities.\n3. Improving urban infrastructure and services is a priority development objective of the\nGovernment as expressed in the National Development Plan (PROPENAS). Due to budgetary\nconstraints,  the  Government  is  promoting  PSP  in  the  infrastructure  sector  to  address  the\nbacklog of investments, relieve pressure on public funds, free budget resources for social and\nenvironmental projects that can not achieve cost-recovery, and increase the efficiency of local\nservice delivery. For these same reasons, local governments wish to supplement financing\nsources  for  much  needed  infrastructure  investments  by  attracting  private  sector  capital.\nAttracting  private  sector  finance  at  the  local  government  level  requires  well-prepared  and\ncompetitively bid projects, including quality advisory inputs and extensive consultation with\nstakeholder groups. The Government has requested ADB assistance in responding to these\nissues.\n4. A number of ADB- and World Bank-sponsored TAs and ADB urban sector loans have\nassisted local governments to prepare and tender limited PSP projects in the water supply and\nwaste sector with sovereign loan proceeds passed on to local governments on a grant basis.2 At\nthe same time, requiring repayment of bid costs from the winning private sector bidder has\nbecome increasingly common and financing of PSP project preparation on a grant basis should\n                  \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 16 June 2001.\n2  (i) TA 2837-INO: Capacity Building for Private Sector Participation in Urban Development, for $850,000, approved\non 29 July 1997; (ii) World Bank TA: TAP4I (iii) Loan 1383-INO: Sumatra Urban Development Sector Project, for\n$122 million, approved on 26 September 1995; (iv) Loan 1384-INO: West Java Urban Development Sector Project,\nfor $63 million, approved on 26 September 1995; (v) Loan 1587: Metropolitan Bogor, Tangerang & Bekasi Urban\nDevelopment Sector Project, for $52.1 million, approved on 19 December 1996.", "2\nbe  phased  out  where  such  practice  is  feasible.  The  PSP  Development  Facility  for  Urban\nInfrastructure  (the  Facility)  will  be  structured  as  a  revolving  credit  facility  for  TA  to  local\ngovernments for soliciting PSP projects, including the preparation of feasibility studies and\ntender documents, as well as bid process and negotiation assistance. The end-borrowers of the\nproceeds from the Facility will be the beneficiary local governments with the winning bidder of\nthe PSP project as the primary repayment source.\n5. It is presently envisaged that, if a PSP bid fails, repayment would come from the local\ngovernments, in order to create ownership for the PSP bid. This will be further explored during\nthe TA. The Facility will therefore focus on creditworthy local governments and the concept of a\ngrant-intercept mechanism will be explored as collateral to mitigate local government credit risk.\nUnder its present policy, the Government does not guarantee local government borrowings, and\ngovernment regulation 107/2000 puts restrictions on local government borrowing. However, the\nGovernment supports the development of a local government credit market and is amending the\nregulation to facilitate broader access to loan financing.\n6. In the past, the main conduits for channeling external assistance to local governments\nwere direct on-lending mechanisms from the Ministry of Finance, such as the subsidiary loan\nagreement  and  the  regional  development  account.  Such  mechanisms  are  unlikely  to  be\ncontinued as their performance is unsatisfactory.3 For that reason, financial intermediaries such\nas state banks, with a sovereign guarantee, are expected to play a catalytic role in channeling\nADB funds such as the TA loan to local governments and supporting access to capital markets\nfor urban infrastructure. Regarding the funds channeling mechanism, the proposed project will\nsubstantially draw from the reports under previous ADB projects exploring this topic.4 Two state\nbanks have expressed interest in the project, which will represent an entry to municipal finance\nand a nucleus to the development of a municipal credit market. Consideration will be given to a\nfuture credit line for PSP projects.\n7. Supporting  the  decentralization  and  regional  development  process,  the  Facility  will\nprovide a sustainable mechanism for facilitating PSP in the provision of infrastructure at the\nlocal government level. It will promote good governance by helping to ensure a transparent and\ncompetitive process in soliciting PSP in urban infrastructure and to produce greater efficiencies\nand better services for consumers. Lessons learned from the development of PSP projects such\nas the Pekanbaru Water Concession and the Depok Waste Concession will be considered for\nprojects to be prepared under the TA loan. The Facility will directly benefit the poor through the\nprovision  of  basic  services  in  creditworthy  local  governments  and  indirectly  by  releasing\nGovernment budget resources for the poorer local governments.\n8. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Indonesia5 and Private Sector Development\nStrategy6 support the Government\u2019s priorities to encourage PSP in infrastructure based on a\nsound regulatory framework. In this regard, the proposed TA loan will be complemented by\nADB\u2019s TA 3761-INO,7 which will develop a regulatory framework for the water supply sector.\n                  \n3  See report Indonesia: The Regional Development Account and Alternatives for Financing Urban Infrastructure\nunder Loan 1501-INO: Regional Development Account\n4 Loan 1501-INO: Regional Development Account and Loan, for $50 million, approved on 5 December 1996; and\nLoan 1729-PHI: LGU Private Infrastructure Project Development Facility, for $3 million, approved on 20 December\n1999.\n5 ADB. 2001.

To  support  transparent  and  competitive  tendering,  the  Government  introduced\nPresidential Decree 7/1998 for procurement of PSP projects. This regulation does not account\nfor regional autonomy. In addition, the central Government\u2019s handling of PSP guidance should\nbe optimized. The Government is aware of this problem, which will be addressed by ADB\u2019s TA\n3720-INO.13 To regain investor confidence, the Government has set up an interdepartmental\nCommittee for Acceleration of Infrastructure Development, which is preparing an infrastructure\nlaw that will review, upgrade, and combine the provisions of Presidential Decrees 7/1998 and\n18/2000 (for public sector procurement). For the interim period, within a period of six months the\nGovernment  will  introduce  revisions  of  Presidential  Decree  7/1998  to  remedy  the  current\nshortcomings.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n10. The TA will help formulate, design, and prepare a TA loan project for local governments\nto finance consultancy services for soliciting and managing PSP in urban infrastructure projects.\nThe goal of the PSP Development Facility for Urban Infrastructure (the Facility) is to increase\nPSP  in  the  provision  of  urban  infrastructure  investments  and  services;  promote  good\ngovernance, competition, and transparency in the selection of project sponsors; and develop a\nlocal government credit market.\nB.  Scope\n11. The  TA  will  comprise  five  components.  The  first  component  will  assess  the  local\ngovernment  finance  system,  including  the  supply  to,  demand  for,  and  constraints  to  local\ngovernment borrowing and to PSP in urban infrastructure projects. The Government\u2019s future\nplans to support local government finance will be reviewed and the types of local governments\nand infrastructure to be considered under the TA loan will be fine tuned. The second component\nwill include a review and assessment of alternative funds channeling mechanisms and the\nidentification  of  a  suitable  intermediary  and  institutional  arrangements  for  the  Facility.  A\nworkshop will be conducted to solicit consensus on the option. The third component comprises\na detailed analysis of the selected intermediary. The fourth component will design and develop\nthe  detailed  modalities  of  the  Facility,  including  risk  assessment,  terms  and  conditions  of\nsubloans, and lending procedures. Implementation will be facilitated through identification of\nobstacles  and  remedial  actions,  and  the  project  will  be  promoted  through  five  regional\n                  \n8 TA 3178-INO: Capacity Building for Setting Up District-Level Financial and Budgetary Systems, for $460,000,\napproved on 25 March 1999; and TA 3326-INO: Urban Sector Development in a Decentralizing Environment, for\n$600,000, approved on 8 December 1999.\n9 World Bank: TAP4I and Urban Policy Reform\n10TA 3782-INO: Reform of Water Enterprises, for $750,000, approved on 29 November 2001.\n11TA 3777-INO: Fiscal Decentralization, for $500,000, approved on 19 November 2001.\n12Proposed Loan-INO: Building Local Government Capacity for Decentralization.\n13TA 3720-INO: Strengthening Procurement Policies, Legal Frameworks, and Institutions, for $500,000, approved on\n19 September 2001.", "4\nworkshops. Under the fifth component the consultant will identify and deliver systems and\nprograms needed for ease of implementation of the Facility.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising $515,000 in\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $235,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide\n$600,000  to  meet  all  foreign  exchange  requirements  and  $85,000  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support\nFacility,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of\nSettlement  and  Regional  Infrastructure,  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  costs\namounting to $150,000 equivalent, which will cover counterpart staff remuneration, per diem\nand travel, part of six stakeholder consultation and dissemination workshops, and office space.\nDetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are attached as Appendix 2. The Government\nhas been informed that the approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing\nproject.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Agency for Construction and Investment\nDevelopment of the Ministry of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure, represented by the\nCenter  for  Infrastructure  Investment  Development  (CIID).  CIID  will  establish  a  project\nmanagement unit (PMU) that will be responsible for organizing the technical and administrative\naspects of the TA. The PMU will include clearly identified, suitably qualified, and experienced\ncounterpart staff, supplemented, if necessary, by personnel from relevant line ministries, to work\nalongside the TA consultants, including staff covering competencies in banking and financial\ninstitutions, municipal finance (including credit and governance rating), law, and PSP in urban\ninfrastructure projects. Counterpart staff will work full time (at least three staff) and part time\nunder the overall direction of the head of the PMU. The PMU will include at least one senior\nstaff member from CIID. The TA consultants will provide full support to the head of the PMU and\nwill work in close collaboration with the counterpart team. The Government\u2019s interdepartmental\nCommittee for Acceleration of Infrastructure Development, including the Ministry of Finance, will\nsupport the implementation of the TA.\n14. The TA will be carried out by a firm of consultants. The TA will require approximately 12\nperson-months of international and 20 person-months of domestic consulting services, with\nexpertise  in  banking  and  financial  institutions,  municipal  finance  (including  credit  and\ngovernance  rating),  project  finance,  law,  and  PSP  in  urban  infrastructure  projects.  The\nGovernment has requested advanced action for the engagement of consultants. Using the\nsimplified technical proposal format, the consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  or  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nengagement of domestic consultants. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. To facilitate the TA implementation, CIID will provide logistical\nsupport for the consultants, including adequately furnished office space within CIID, and access\nto communications facilities. The consultants will be based in Jakarta and will be expected to\ntravel as necessary to the regions, particularly during the period of stakeholder consultations.\nOutline terms of reference for the consultants are included in Appendix 3.\n15. The TA is expected to commence in March 2002, be implemented over six months, and\nbe completed in September 2002. The consultants will produce (i) an inception report within 3\nweeks of TA commencement; (ii) an interim report 8 weeks after commencement; (iii) a draft", "5\nfinal report containing a draft project 19 weeks after commencement; (iv) a final report within 2\nweeks of receiving comments on the draft final report.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of\nIndonesia, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of preparing\nthe  Private  Sector  Participation  Development  Facility  for  Urban  Infrastructure  Project,  and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.", "6 Appendix 1\nPRELIMINARY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN PROJECT FRAMEWORK\nPerformance Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions\nDesign Summary Indicators/Targets And Risks\nGoal\n\u2022  Increase private sector \u2022  Attract more private \u2022  National statistics \u2022  Political stability and\nparticipation in the sector capital for \u2022  Government economic recovery\nprovision of urban urban infrastructure departmental records on uncertain\ninfrastructure and service provision private sector \u2022  Continued Government\ninvestments and \u2022  Increased number of participation activity; support for regional\nservices competitively bid number of competitively autonomy and private\n\u2022  Promote good projects with private bid projects with private sector participation in urban\ngovernance, sector participation sector participation infrastructure\ncompetition, and \u2022  Increased number of \u2022  Size and performance of \u2022  Return of investor\ntransparency in the local government municipal lending confidence\nselection of private regulations for private portfolio\nproject sponsors sector participation in\n\u2022  Develop a municipal line with revised\ncredit market Presidential Decree 7\n\u2022  Increased access for\nlocal governments to\nlong-term financing\nPurpose\n\u2022  Facilitate access to \u2022  Local governments \u2022  Technical assistance \u2022  Local government\nfinance for local preparing, bidding, (TA) / loan progress borrowing ability and\ngovernments to negotiating, and reports capacity\nprepare and tender managing private \u2022  Review missions \u2022  Limited experience with\nsuitable urban sector projects \u2022  Project completion/TA private sector participation\ninfrastructure projects \u2022  Familiarity of financial loan completion report projects\nfor private sector intermediaries such\n\u2022  Resistance to open bidding\nparticipation state banks in local\n\u2022  Enhance competence government credit procedures\nof financial and governance \u2022  Limited interest by the\nintermediaries such as assessment and private sector\nstate banks in rating\nmunicipal finance\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 1)", "7 Appendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.
