INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  South\u2013South cooperation is an essential aspect of interregional cooperation as stronger \neconomic links between developing regions, such as between Asia and the Pacific and Latin \nAmerica, are providing opportunities for these regions to learn and benefit from each other\u2019s \npolicy  lessons  and  experiences.  Such  interregional  cooperation  can  also  help  developing \ncountries attain sustainable and inclusive economic growth amid the dwindling bilateral aid \nprograms  of  developed  countries,  and  has  contributed  to  the  formulation  of  effective  and \nefficient  solutions  to  some  common  development  challenges  within  and  across  regions.1 \nCultivating this type of cooperation is also in line with the post-2015 development agenda,2 \nwhich aims to address global development challenges by enhancing trade and financial links, \nmitigating  financial  vulnerabilities,  and  managing  regional  public  goods.  This  technical \nassistance (TA) aims to foster greater research collaboration and knowledge sharing between \nAsia and the Pacific and Latin America on policy issues integral to the regions\u2019 growth and \ndevelopment (paras. 4\u20137). \n \n2.  The TA supports regional cooperation and integration (RCI), a core area under Strategy \n2020 and elaborated in the RCI strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).3 The strategy \nrecognizes the importance of creating innovative regional knowledge and solutions to address \nthe regions\u2019  development  issues. The  innovation  will  manifest  through  (i)  collective  action, \ncooperation, and knowledge sharing to help Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America understand the \nrelationship between their economic and development policies; and (ii) the crowdsourcing of \nnew ideas. The TA will strengthen the knowledge platform for ADB\u2019s RCI strategy by drawing \nout the connections between the three thematic areas of this TA (paras. 4\u20137). It supports the \nrole of regional development banks, such as ADB and the Inter-American Development Bank \n(IADB), to collaborate and share their regional perspective on key development issues. The TA \nsupports national and regional growth strategies of Asian countries and ADB operations and \naims to instill the findings and lessons into ADB\u2019s country partnership and regional cooperation \nstrategies. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The TA  will  focus on  the following:  (i)  strengthening  developing  member countries\u2019 \n(DMCs) understanding of the drivers of various types of foreign direct investment (FDI) and their \nimpact  on  growth  and  development,  including  the  effectiveness  of  international  trade  and \ninvestment  agreements;  (ii)  deepening  DMCs\u2019  assessment  of  financial  interconnectedness, \nspillover, and risk management; and (iii) exploring how regional and interregional cooperation \npolicies can be used to manage regional public goods.5  \n \n                                                \n1  The international community has recognized that cooperation between developing countries is critical in fostering \nknowledge sharing and collaborative policy work, and has launched various initiatives to encourage more of these \npartnerships. An important initiative is the adoption in 1978 of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and \nImplementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries as it encouraged developing countries to assist \none another to achieve equitable partnerships in global development. In 2008, the international community \nendorsed  the  Accra  Agenda  for  Action  to  accelerate  the  implementation  of  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid \nEffectiveness. A joint knowledge work by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Inter-American Development Bank \n(IADB), and ADB Institute (2012)\u2014titled Shaping the Future of the Asia\u2013Latin America and the Caribbean \nRelationship\u2014was a well-received synopsis of potential cooperation between the regions, and highlighted many of \nthe issues this regional TA seeks to revisit and address amid a weak global economy. \n2  United Nations Development Group. 2014.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 July 2016. \n5  ADB and IADB identified and agreed on these issues during teleconferences held in March 2016. \n ", "2 \n4.  Foreign direct investment, international investment agreements, and economic \ngrowth. Countries in Asia and the Pacific and Latin America are facing economic and trade \ngrowth slowdown and persistent income disparity. FDI allows countries to link to regional and \nglobal value chains, facilitating trade and regional integration and contributing to economic \ngrowth  through  better  international  resource  mobilization  and  increased  productivity  and \ntechnological spillovers. FDI helps reduce poverty through job creation, wage increases, gender \nempowerment, and better working conditions. However, the empirical evidence on the impact of \nFDI on the recipient economy is mixed and depends on the country, time coverage, and the \nsector and industry-specific contexts. Given the growing trend of outward FDI from emerging \neconomies such as the People\u2019s Republic of China and India,6 understanding the impact and \ndrivers of FDI between developing countries is of policy relevance. Developing economies with \na poor institutional quality and business environment may find it easier to attract FDI from \ncountries with a smaller cultural and institutional distance, while also deriving greater spillovers.7 \nIn this context, opportunities for interregional FDI between Asia  and the Pacific  and Latin \nAmerica  have  not  been  fully  explored.8 Both  regions  can  benefit  from  an  increase  and \ndiversification of interregional investment flows due to complementary comparative advantages \nand resources. \n \n5.  International investment agreements (IIAs) aim to promote FDI by creating a business \nclimate favorable to foreign investors. The rise of bilateral and multilateral IIAs in developing \ncountries points to a wave of investment cooperation between developing countries. There have \nbeen policy discussions among developing economies to facilitate an information exchange on \ntrade and investment agreements and relevant data sets on cooperation between developing \ncountries via a web-based exchange platform such as the Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) \nExchange.  A  key  question  is  whether  IIAs,  which  form  the  substance  of  the  investment \nenvironment, help improve market access and increase FDI. So far, theoretical and empirical \nstudies have shown mixed results, due to the (i) diverse range of IIAs, from bilateral investment \ntreaties (BITs) to investment chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs); (ii) lack of data on and \nunderstanding of different country-specific provisions in the BITs or FTAs; and (iii) difficulty in \ndisentangling external factors that shape BITs or FTA investment chapters from the changing \ninvestment environment. From a policy perspective, there is a need to adopt a new approach to \nunbundle the investment chapters of FTAs and investment treaties into their specific provisions, \nand  explore  the  heterogeneity  of  domestic  and  international  contexts  to  understand  more \neffective developing country IIAs to promote FDI. \n \n6.  Financial integration, challenges, and opportunities. The Asian financial market is \nmore integrated globally than regionally. Cross-border financial flows have been rising rapidly, \ncreating  the  mechanism  for  greater  financial  connectivity.  Intra-Asian  equity  flows  have \nincreased to about a quarter of the region\u2019s total flows, although they have also been fluctuating \nlargely, in tandem with the increased volatility in global equity markets. In the debt markets, \nintra-Asian investments continue to grow, although the level remains small (16%). Financial \ninterconnectedness matters because it can be a channel for contagion.9 For instance, United \n                                                \n6  Outward FDI from emerging Asia surpassed inward FDI in 2014.

Similarly, \nmultinationals from Latin America have yet to adequately link to Asian production networks and value chains. ADB, \nIADB, and ADB Institute. 2012. Shaping the Future of the Asia\u2013Latin America and the Caribbean Relationship. \nManila. \n9  Financial connectivity can also be monitored by the network of credit exposures, trading links, and dependencies \nbetween financial institutions. To date, Asia and the Pacific and Latin America have used a number of instruments \nto foster greater financial stability. \n ", "3 \nStates investors dominate equity investments while European investors lead debt markets. This \nsuggests financial shocks in advanced economies could trigger greater financial volatility in Asia \nand the Pacific. Given these trends, developing economies need to further strengthen their \ndomestic investor base, attract more stable intra-regional flows, and enhance financial stability. \nCooperation between developing countries could facilitate discussions on regional cooperation \npolicies and initiatives that could insulate Asia and the Pacific from greater financial volatility and \nprotect its economy from financial spillover and contagion costs. This TA would provide for an \nexchange of lessons and experience in this area. \n \n7.  Managing regional public goods. Public goods such as clean air are non-excludable \nand non-rivalrous, which mean they can be consumed by anyone. But consumption does not \nreduce the public goods\u2019 benefit to others. As a result, the market underprovides public goods \nbecause potential suppliers are deterred by the inability to profit from their efforts. Public sector \nintervention creates appropriate policies and ensures an adequate supply of public goods. \nDemand for greater regional public goods will likely increase as the region becomes more \nintegrated. But increasing regional integration and macroeconomic interdependence in Asia and \nthe Pacific brings unintended consequences, such as the spread of diseases and cross-border \ncrime.10 Delivering regional public goods, meanwhile, comes with problems such as the lack of \n(i) spillover and/or benefit for major suppliers, (ii) lead countries, and (iii) interest, in part due to \napathy and the perceived lack of influence in international forums where different regional public \ngoods are discussed. Increasing interregional cooperation between Asia and the Pacific and \nLatin America might have similar unintended consequences, but it can also create opportunities, \nsynergies, and a broader policy dialogue in dealing more effectively with health, climate change, \nand regional infrastructure and services. It would also allow both regions to learn from and \nleverage their respective intra-regional integration experiences. Existing regional institutions can \nplay supportive roles in this aspect.11 In this regard, a cooperative mechanism for knowledge \nsharing between ADB and IADB will allow for a useful pooling of expertise. \n \n8.  This TA aims to support research collaboration between ADB and IADB on a series of \ncomparative studies to extract the lessons and experiences from each region  and identify \npotential policy implications. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  will  be  increased  cooperation  between  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  Latin \nAmerica. This cooperation will cover trade, financial integration and stability, and the promotion \nand better management of regional public goods for inclusive and sustainable growth in DMCs \nin Asia and the Pacific and Latin America. The outcome will be increased effectiveness and \nquality of policy development through knowledge sharing, policy dialogue, and coordination \nbetween Asia and the Pacific and Latin America. \n \n                                                \n10  World Economic Forum. 2016.

More regular contact and coordination is needed \namong these regional institutions to identify potential regional public goods and join forces to support those already \nidentified by member countries. As an example, there is growing collaboration between IADB and ADB to intensify \ncooperation between Asia and the Pacific and Latin America. IADB and ADB. 2002.

The  TA  will  conduct  research,  knowledge  sharing  workshops,  and  database \ndevelopment to improve the effectiveness and quality of policy making in Asia and the Pacific \nand Latin America on enhancing trade and FDI, strengthening regional financial stability, and \nmanaging regional public goods. \n \n11.  Research. To expand policy makers\u2019 understanding of national and regional drivers and \nimpacts of FDI flows between developing countries, the TA will produce background papers and \nreports that employ applied econometric methodology to examine the pull-and-push factors that \ndrive FDI flows. In particular, richer and more granular data on FDI will be employed. The TA \nwill systematically examine how BIT provisions and FTA investment chapters can affect FDI \nflows. It will also identify the impacts of various investment provisions in BITs and FTAs through \na new and more comprehensive database. The country and time coverage of the FTA database \nin ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center will be expanded, and a more comprehensive and \nsystematic coding of the provisions will be carried out in collaboration with IADB. \n \n12.  In collaboration with IADB, the TA will carry out studies to (i) enhance the comparative \nunderstanding of financial  vulnerability, contagion, and interconnectedness; and (ii) explore \nways to further strengthen financial development and stability, attracting more stable intra-\nregional flows of various sources. The TA will help facilitate the discussions on systemic links \nand  increase  understanding  of  the  complexity  of  financial  markets  and  the  potential  for \ndisruptions to spread swiftly across markets and borders. The importance of assessing the \nsystemic implications of financial interconnectedness will be recognized. The TA will pursue \npolicy  considerations  by  case  studies  and  empirical  analyses  of  policy  measures  for  the \neconomic and financial resilience of developing Asia. \n \n13.  The TA will explore various modalities of managing regional public goods in Asia and the \nPacific and Latin America to understand policy implications for the region.  Regional public \ngoods in areas such as regional health, climate change, and regional infrastructure and services \nwill be assessed in terms of regional cooperation and issues. Doing so will create synergy with \nnational and/or subregional work led by ADB regional departments and thematic groups. The \nTA will also organize seminars to disseminate the results of background papers and to discuss \nthe issues discussed in paras. 4\u20137 with IADB and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) \npolicy makers. \n \n14.  The TA will produce three thematic policy reports detailing (i) recommendations to APEC \npolicy makers based on FDI comparative studies and background papers; (ii) challenges and \nopportunities from financial integration, including financial connectivity and vulnerabilities; and \n(iii) ways to manage regional public goods. \n \n15.  Knowledge sharing workshops. At least three knowledge sharing workshops will be \norganized to disseminate the research findings on each of the three themes (paras. 4\u20137), \nsupporting regional policy forums such as APEC events and to discuss policy implications with \npolicy makers. \n \n16.  Database development. To harness the benefits of the TA for both regions, the TA will \nexplore ways to promote and share relevant information and exchange data on international \ntrade and investment agreements via an exchange platform such as the RTA Exchange\u2014a \nvirtual portal coordinated by IADB where users can access data, news, and analysis\u2014and \nconnect and share information related to RTAs. A database on BITs and FTA investments \nchapters will also be developed. \n \n ", "5 \n17.  A key risk is that limited data and/or poor data quality could deliver inconclusive results. \nTo address this, ADB has consulted closely with IADB and APEC with respect to the ideas \nbehind  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Division  (ERCI)  is  currently \ncoordinating with experts in the field to ensure limited data and/or poor data quality will not \nhamper the efforts under the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency for  the TA and  ADB\u2019s  Economic Research  and \nRegional Cooperation Department will be the implementing agency. ADB will coordinate with \nIADB, which will implement a similar TA project for Latin America, to build synergies and foster \nextra-regional sharing of knowledge and experience.12 ADB will also work with research centers \nof excellence such as the University of South Wales, the Hong Kong University of Science and \nTechnology, and the National University of Singapore. The Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation  Department  will  coordinate  closely  with  ADB  operations  units  (regional \ndepartments and resident mission offices) and the Strategy and Policy Department to ensure \nthat  benefits  from  the  TA  are  maximized.  In  particular,  ERCI  will  undertake  this  TA  in \ncoordination with similar IADB efforts to look at how FDIs, IIAs, financial interconnectedness \nand vulnerability, and managing regional public goods can enhance sustainable and inclusive \ngrowth in Asia and the Pacific and Latin America. By cooperating with IADB, ERCI\u2014through this \nTA\u2014will facilitate knowledge sharing of and learning from regional perspectives relevant to \ndeveloping countries in Asia and the Pacific and Latin America. The project will be implemented \nfrom October 2016 to September 2018. \n \n20.  The TA will require 24 person-months of international consulting services, 38 person-\nmonths of national consulting services, and 120 person-days of resource persons\u2019 participation. \nADB will hire consultants and resource persons individually following its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The scope of work and outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Procurement of equipment will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).   A team \nfor contract administration will be set up within ERCI to ensure smooth administration, manage \nconsultants, and consolidate their output. \n \n21.  ADB  will  conduct  workshops,  local  training  events,  seminars,  and  conferences  in \nconjunction with some APEC meetings, to present and discuss the key findings of background \npapers that will be commissioned under this TA. ADB staff will participate as resource persons \nin some of these workshops. All disbursements under the TA will be made following ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing Research Alliance and South\u2013South Development Policy Cooperation Between Asia \nand the Pacific and Latin America, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n12 ADB will cover activities under this TA in its DMCs.
