I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Road Connectivity Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  improve  connectivity  between  the  expressway  and  local  transport \nnetworks in the southern region.2 Capacity will be improved on 33 kilometers (km) of national \nhighways linking three expressway interchanges, and the capacity of the Road Development \nAuthority (RDA) will be enhanced in planning the expressway connectivity improvement and \nensuring project implementation readiness.  By amplifying the benefits of the country\u2019s first \nexpressway network, the project will contribute to one of the Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s key \ndevelopment goals, which is to develop the country into a regional trading center between the \nEast and West. It will also improve access to economic opportunities, as well as basic social, \nhealth, and education facilities. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  After the end of its three decades of civil conflict in May 2009, Sri Lanka achieved  \neconomic growth exceeding 8% annually in 2010 and 2011. The economy slowed to 6.4% in \n2012 due to weak external demand, drought, and floods, but it is expected to edge up in 2013 \nand 2014.3 Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic location at the crossroads of regional maritime trading routes \nhas contributed to its growth. The transport sector contributed 12% of the country\u2019s gross \ndomestic  product  in  2011,  which  compares  to  7.9%  in  2005.  To fully  utilize  the  country\u2019s \nstrategic location in the trading routes, the government has focused on developing five strategic \nglobal hubs (aviation, naval, knowledge, commerce, and energy).4 Public investments are being \nmade  to  developing  several  mega-infrastructures,  including  Colombo  seaport,  Katunayake \nairport, Hambantota seaport, Hambantota airport, and an expressway network connecting the \ninternational trading facilities.  \n \n4.  The  government  envisages  Western  Province,  with  its  rich  natural  and  human \nresources,  as  a  regional  center  hub  and  Southern  Province  as  a  strategic  area  on  the \ninternational trading corridor complementary to Western Province. Western Province drives the \ncountry\u2019s economy, contributing more than 45% of national gross domestic product in 2010. It is \nalso the most densely populated province in Sri Lanka and has the highest vehicle ownership \nrate. Southern Province, with the  second-highest vehicle ownership rate in the country, is \nclosely integrated with Western Province through physical and economic connections. With the \nfunction of international hub being developed in Colombo and Hambantota of Western and \nSouthern  provinces,  respectively,  the  country\u2019s  future  sustainable  growth  demands  an \nintegrated inland transport system (and particularly in the southern region) to efficiently move \npeople and goods. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Road Project Preparatory Facility, funded by ADB, was utilized to undertake project preparatory activities, \nincluding preparation of detailed design and bidding documents.

Road transport \naccounts  for  95%  of  passenger-kilometers  and  98%  of  freight  ton-kilometers.  With  its \ncomprehensive road network comprising about 96 km of expressway, 11,922 km of national \nroads, 15,975 km of provincial roads, and 80,000 km of local roads, the country\u2019s population \nand centers of economic activity are well covered. The average vehicle ownership rate for Sri \nLanka is estimated at about 152 vehicles per 1,000 persons in 2011 after average annual \ngrowth of 11.4% since 2007. It is estimated that to maintain the current levels of transport \nservices, road capacity would need to be doubled every 8\u201310 years.  \n \n6.  The transport sector\u2019s most significant accomplishment in connecting the international \ntrading facilities was the commissioning of the Southern Expressway on 27 November 2011. \nThe Southern Transport Development Project laid the foundations for modernizing the country\u2019s \ntransport sector by completing a 96 km expressway, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka.5  After the \nexpressway was opened, the travel time between Kottawa of Western Province and Galle of \nSouthern  Province  was  reduced  from  5  hours  to  1.5  hours.  Aside  from  the  Southern \nExpressway, three additional projects in the southern region are ongoing to further develop the \nexpressway network: (i) Outer Circular Highway, (ii) Colombo\u2013Katunayake Expressway, and (iii) \nPinnaduwa\u2013Godagama Expressway. In the long term, the government plans gradually to extend \nthe expressway network toward the northern and eastern regions so that a trunk road network \nwill be established comprising well-connected expressways and national roads.6 \n \n7.  With the insertion of an expressway network and expansion of major trading facilities, a \nnumber of challenges are emerging for the road transport system. The access routes to the \nSouthern Expressway are usually congested. The roads connecting to the interchanges do not \nhave sufficient capacity to absorb and distribute the expressway traffic throughput. This problem \nwill be exacerbated when the three new expressway sections are completed. The investment \ninto improving the capacity of access routes remains inadequate because (i) the road sector \ncompetes for budget allocation with such other sectors as education, social, and health; and (ii) \nthe fund-raising is inadequate in both the public and private sectors. Even with sufficient budget, \nthe utilization would be less than optimal due to outdated design and construction technologies.  \n \n8.   Limited capacity of road agencies for developing and managing the road sector assets \nis another cause of the connectivity problem. First, connectivity needs were not fully envisaged \nat the time of planning the expressway network. An integrated plan to ensure connectivity \nbetween the expressway and local transport networks was not adequately prepared. Second, \nthe design standards and procedures have not been updated to address the requirements of \ntraffic flow in expressway interchange areas and populated areas, as well as to incorporate \nmeasures  on  climate  change  adaptation,  maintenance,  and  road  safety.  Third,  the  traffic \nmanagement on routes with heavy traffic is not effective. Finally, the road safety policies and \nregulations need to be enforced in their engineering and nonengineering aspects. \n \n9.  To address road connectivity challenges in the southern region, the flows of passengers \nand  freight  need  to  be  facilitated  in  an  efficient  and  cost-effective  manner.  This  requires \nimmediate  actions  on two  aspects:  (i)  improving the  capacity  of  the access  routes  to the \nexpressway  network,  and  (ii)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  road  agencies  in  developing  and \nmanaging the road sector assets by preparing a long-term connectivity improvement plan that \n                                                \n5  ADB. 1999.

To implement the actions, the government is working in parallel with a \nnumber of development partners, including the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the \nWorld Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China, the China Development Bank, and ADB.7 The \ngovernment in particular requested ADB to provide loans to finance the proposed Southern \nRoad Connectivity Project to be implemented by RDA. \n \n10.  ADB and the government agreed in the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 that \nADB\u2019s assistance in the transport sector will contribute to the sector outcome of improving \nnationwide connectivity for the movement of people and goods.8 ADB is financing four road \nprojects to achieve this outcome, but most of these are in the northern and eastern regions.9 \nAlthough not included in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014,10 the proposed \nproject will complement the ongoing projects in supporting the sector outcome. Its objective is \nalso fully in line with the government\u2019s sector strategy to establish a modern transport system \nthat will accelerate economic growth while reducing travel time and cost and improving safety. \nIn the future, ADB\u2019s assistance will focus on (i) relieving traffic congestion in the urban areas \nand on the trunk roads, (ii) improving basic connectivity for the lagging regions and for important \nlinks,  and  (iii)  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  road  maintenance  scheme  at  national  and \nprovincial levels. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be an efficient road transport in the southern region. The \noutcome will be improved connectivity between the expressway network and the local transport \nnetwork in the southern region.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project will deliver two outputs: (i) improved capacity for about 33.5 km of key \nnational highways linking the expressway network in the southern region, and (ii) enhanced \ncapacity  of  RDA  in  planning  expressway  connectivity  improvement  and  in  ensuring \nimplementation readiness. The outputs will be achieved through:  \n(i)  National  highway  improvement.  This  will  improve  five  priority  national \nhighways  providing  connectivity  to  three  interchanges  of  the  Southern \nExpressway:  (a)  B295  (2.5  km,  Moratuwa\u2013Piliyandala),  (b)  B389  (2.1  km, \nRatmalana\u2013Mirihana), (c) B157 (12.4 km, Southern Expressway\u2013Matugama), (d) \nA004  (2.1  km,  Kirulapona\u2013Homagama),  and  (e)  B084  (14.4  km,  Kesbawa\u2013\nPokunuwita). The priority highways were selected according to the current road \ncondition and capacity, travel demands, and readiness for improvement. \n                                                \n7  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  ADB. 2011.

This  will  be \nimplemented  by  assisting  RDA  in  developing  a  long-term  expressway \nconnectivity  improvement  plan. The  preparation  of  such  plan  will  involve  (a) \nscreening  the  national  highways  linking  the  expressway  network  for  the \nimprovement needs; (b) programming the future projects for feasibility study, \ndetailed engineering, land acquisition and resettlement, and procurement of civil \nworks; (c) carrying out feasibility study for about 250 km of national highways; (d) \nundertaking detailed engineering for about 200 km of national highways; (e) \nassisting to improve the design standards and construction technology; and (f) \ndelivering training programs on planning methodology, design standards, and \nconstruction technology. \n \nD.

Interest during construction for ADB loans has been computed at the 5-\nyear forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.5% per annum for the ordinary capital resources loan \nand of 2.0% per annum for the loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. Commitment charges for the ordinary \ncapital resources loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $70  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance civil works and consulting services for output 1 (national highway \nimprovement),  and a  loan  of  SDR3,329,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources to  help \nfinance the consulting services for output 2 (RDA capacity enhancement). The government will \nfinance taxes, duties, road maintenance, and land acquisition and resettlement of about $25 \nmillion. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n15.  The loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will have a 26-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; straight-line, commitment-linked repayment; an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized into the loan); and such other terms and conditions to be agreed \nin the draft loan and project agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 15.75 \nyears and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n18.  The engineering design has been carried out for all project roads based on site condition \nsurveys and field investigations. The required improvement works are optimized for economy \nand  construction  efficiency  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  and  national  design \nstandards. The construction method will utilize proven technology  using standard materials \ncompatible with local conditions. All civil works contracts will also include 5-year performance-\nbased  maintenance  to  secure  maintenance  and  promote  private  sector  development.  The \nproject roads have been assessed for climate vulnerability according to the National Climate \nChange Adaptation Strategy for Sri Lanka.12 Key risks assessed include (i) shifting of climate \nzones, (ii) floods, (iii) landslides, (iv) rise in sea level, and (v) drought exposure. The design of \nthe project roads includes provisions for embankment rising and drainage enhancement. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  Economic viability. The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB \nguidelines.13 The principal benefits calculated are savings in vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime.14 The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 18.3%. Sensitivity analysis \nindicates that the project has an EIRR above 12% even with adverse variation in costs and \nbenefit streams. Therefore, the proposed improvements are economically viable. In addition to \nthe quantified benefits, the project will bring significant benefits to overall regional development. \nOpening of the Southern Expressway has significantly reduced travel times along the corridor. \nThe  improvement  of  project  road  sections,  which  provide  connectivity  to  the  Southern \nExpressway,  will  enhance  overall  network  connectivity  of  the  southern  region.  Industrial \ndevelopment will also benefit from the improved national roads, because the investment climate \nwill be upgraded by better connectivity to the supply sources and markets outside the region. \nWhile such benefits are not quantified, these are the envisaged impacts of the project in relation \nto economic development and poverty reduction. \n \n20.  Financial sustainability. The unit cost related to operation and maintenance of the \nproject roads will decrease after construction because the road condition will be improved. In \nthe long term, the required operation and maintenance costs for project roads represent only a \nvery small proportion of the budget allocation (about 0.3% of the RDA maintenance budget in \n2012). In view of recent trends, an adequate budget allocation is expected. The government has \nearmarked a budget amount for 5 years of performance-based maintenance, which covers both \nroutine  and  periodic  maintenance.  It  is  reasonable  to  expect  the  project  to  be  financially \nsustainable. \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  Policy and legal. RDA, the implementing agency, is responsible for development and \nmaintenance of the national highway network. RDA was established as a statutory authority with \na separate legal personality by the Road Development Authority Act in 1981. RDA\u2019s chairperson \nreports to the secretary of the Ministry of Ports and Highways (MOPH). \n \n                                                \n12 Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Ministry  of  Environment,  Climate  Change  Secretariat.

Manila. \n14 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n22.  Institutional capacity. MOPH and RDA have sufficient capacity, past experience, and \ninstitutional  strength  for  procuring  the  civil  works,  selecting  consultants,  administering  the \ncontracts, and managing the overall project implementation.  \n \n23.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was carried out for RDA. \nRDA has prior and ongoing experience of implementing ADB-funded projects. It has satisfactory \ncapacity in project financial accounting and  in ADB disbursement procedures. RDA has a \ndedicated project accounting and finance team with suitably qualified accountants. RDA will \nestablish and maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources \nreceived and expenditures made for the project, thus ensuring an adequate audit trail. The \ngovernment\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department will annually audit the project accounts and related \nfinancial statements in accordance with international auditing standards.  \n \n24.  Procurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines. The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended from time to time), the Declaration of \nAsset  and  Liabilities  Act,  No.  1  of  1975,  and  the  Permanent  Commission  to  Investigate \nAllegations of Bribery and Corruption Act, No. 19 of 1994 provide a legal basis to deal with \nbribery  and  corruption.  The  auditor  general  monitors  procurement  by  the  agencies,  giving \nspecial attention to procedural propriety in procurement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOPH, and RDA.  \n \n25.  The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  Poverty reduction and social impact. It is estimated that 1.1 million residents in the \nproject areas are direct beneficiaries while the 4.6 million residents in three districts (Colombo, \nKalutara, and Galle) that the Southern Expressway spans are indirect beneficiaries. During \nfocus group discussions held with both men and women, most respondents stated that the \nproposed road rehabilitation and upgrading will help create new economic and employment \nopportunities by improving links to markets, production centers, and other areas with economic \nopportunities. Access to public and social service facilities such as government agencies, health \ncenters, and schools will also be improved. The project will have a short-term impact on poverty \nreduction, as the rural poor in project-impacted areas will be employed for construction. These \nwill increase livelihood opportunities for those who now depend largely on occasional, uncertain \nemployment. The contracts for civil works will include measures to ensure safe and healthy \nworking environments for both men and women laborers. The contractors will be required to \nimplement appropriate measures with respect to equal pay for equal work for men and women, \nhealth and safety at construction sites and labor camps, and an awareness program for workers \non prevention of sexually transmitted infections.15 \n \n27.  Gender.  The  country  now  ranks  midway  on  the  United  Nations  Gender-related \nDevelopment Index. Nationwide, the adult literacy rate for females is 89.3% as compared to \n94.5% for males. Women in project areas typically participate in household activities and some \nare frequent road users for the likes of transporting children to school and visiting markets. \nDuring  consultations,  women  indicated  that  improved  road  conditions  and  connectivity  will \nprovide better access to health services, higher levels of education, economic opportunities, and \nsocial interactions. Time savings due to enhanced road conditions increase the likelihood of \n                                                \n15 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nmore time being spent on productive activities, health care, and self-development. The project \nwill aim to employ 15% women in road maintenance activities. It will provide employment skills \ndevelopment while enhancing personal financial management capacity for all women employed \nin civil works.16 No adverse impact on women due to the project is envisaged.  \n \n28.  A gender action plan has been prepared for the project in order to (i) maximize women\u2019s \naccess to project benefits such as by integrating features accommodative to the elderly, women, \nchildren,  and  the  disabled  into  road  design,  including  paved  and  raised  sidewalks,  paved \nshoulders,  and  road  safety  features;  (ii)  provide  opportunities  to  increase  women\u2019s  skills, \nincomes, and participation in decision making; and (iii) minimize social vulnerability. Practical \nand implementable gender mainstreaming activities have been incorporated into the project.17 \n \n29.  HIV/AIDS.  Sri  Lanka  is  recorded  to  have  a  low  HIV  prevalence  rate,  although  the \nnumber of reported cases has grown over the years. That is due in part to improved access to \ntesting facilities. Countrywide responses have included establishment of the National STD and \nAIDS  Control  Program,  which  helps  to  refurbish  health  clinics  and  establish  outreach  and \nawareness programs. The project has incorporated measures to mitigate HIV/AIDS risks by \nundertaking an awareness program for contractors at construction sites and for project-affected \ncommunities  at  prominent  village  locations.  Awareness-raising  activities  for  project-affected \npersons will be conducted separately for men and women in order to address gender-specific \nissues.  \n \n30.  Human trafficking. Respondents during the social impact assessment did not identify \nhuman trafficking as a significant issue in the project area, although improved road connectivity \nmay trigger movement away from the project area to other parts of the country. Civil works \ncontractors are anticipated to source laborers locally and will not require migrant workers. \nAffected communities will be provided with awareness training on human trafficking. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n1.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n \n31.  The project is categorized as category A in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). All five project roads will be widened, which will create significant impact. Due \nto the linear nature of that impact, the majority of affected households will lose not more than \n10% of their productive assets. Some commercial structures will need to be demolished since \nvarious stretches of the project roads traverse urban areas. Impact has been mitigated where \npossible by reducing the width of the shoulder. Three resettlement plans have been prepared \nfor anticipated land acquisitions, and two due diligence processes regarding land acquisition \nhave been undertaken to verify previous acquisitions by the government. All these have been \ncompleted in accordance with government regulations.18 For the three roads requiring land \nacquisition, it is estimated that 2,188 households including 9,641 persons will be affected. About \n488 households comprising approximately 2,150 persons will experience significant impact. \nAssistance will be in place to restore livelihoods to the same or better conditions compared with \nlivelihood conditions at the pre-project level. For the two roads where the government has \nalready  acquired  land,  due  diligence  identified  15  households  due  interest  payments.  The \ngovernment has allocated funds and these payments will be made prior to project approval. Civil \n                                                \n16 Women\u2019s participation in civil works for the ongoing ADB-funded National Highways Sector Project is between 6% \nand 10%.  \n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Resettlement plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nworks may proceed after compensation and assistance have been fully paid. Resettlement \nplans were prepared and disclosed on ADB website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009),  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1950,  and  the \nNational Involuntary Resettlement Policy introduced in 2001. The project management unit has \nan experienced team implementing the resettlement plans and will be supported by the RDA\u2019s \nEnvironment and Social Division. The project is not expected to have impacts on indigenous \npeoples and is therefore designated Category C. \n \n2.  Environment  \n \n32.  The  project  scope  includes  improvement  of  existing  roads  to  two-lane  or  four-lane \nstandard. The roads are located in urban, suburban, and agricultural areas for most of their \nlengths  with  minimal  forests  or  natural  habitat  areas.  None  fall  within  protected  or \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. The project is therefore classified category B in accordance \nwith  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Road-specific  initial  environmental  examination \nreports, including environmental management plans, have been prepared and disclosed on the \nADB  website.  Anticipated  impacts  under  the  project,  which  are  mostly  restricted  to  the \nconstruction  stage,  comprise  typical  impacts  associated  with  road  construction,  such  as \ngeneration of dust, noise, and construction waste; temporary disruption of traffic; soil erosion \nfrom exposed surfaces; siltation of water bodies; and drainage issues. These can be managed \nby adopting suitable mitigation measures described in the initial environmental examination and \nroad-specific  environmental  management  plans  and  monitored  through  the  environmental \nmonitoring plan. Both environmental management and monitoring plans, along with specific \nclearance requirements of the Central Environmental Authority for each road, will be included \ninto the bidding documents for civil works. Local communities and relevant stakeholders have \nbeen  consulted  during project  preparation,  and  a grievance  redress mechanism  has  been \nestablished to address concerns during project implementation. Financial and human resources \nnecessary for redressing grievances will be covered under the project.19 \n \n33.  The  project  management  units  under  RDA  are  responsible  for  ensuring  proper \nimplementation of the environmental management and monitoring plans. The Environmental \nand Social Division under RDA will provide technical guidance and support to the  project \nmanagement unit in monitoring environmental compliance by the contractors. Additional support \nfor  day-to-day,  site-level  monitoring  and  reporting  will  be  provided  by  the  supervision \nconsultant\u2019s  team,  which  includes  an  environmental  specialist.  Any  updates  to  the \nenvironmental management plan (if required) will be made by the environmental specialist \nunder the supervision consultants and reviewed and approved by the Environmental and Social \nDivision. Annual environmental monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB for \ndisclosure on the ADB website in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. An \ninitial coordination cum training workshop will be organized by the project management units \nwith technical support from the Environmental and Social Division. This will be conducted for the \ncontractors and supervision consultants  before commencing construction works in order to \nagree on modalities for implementing the environmental management and monitoring plans and \nto carry out necessary monitoring and reporting activities. \n \n                                                \n19 Initial environmental examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The  overall  risk  assessment  is  medium  without  mitigation  and  low  with  mitigation. \nIntegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.20  \n \n35.  The key risk is of frequent implementation delay due to the need to prepare detailed \nengineering design and to prolonged land acquisition and resettlement. To mitigate this risk, \ndetailed  design  and  bidding  documents  have  been  prepared  in  advance  to  assist  the \ngovernment  in  implementing  advance  actions  such  as  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and \nprocurement so as to award the first contract shortly after loan effectiveness.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n36.  The government and the MOPH have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n37.  The government and the MOPH have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $70,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nSouthern Road Connectivity Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 26 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR3,329,000 to the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Road Connectivity Project, from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per \nannum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n30 August 2013 \n                                                \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines*  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  By 2020:    Assumptions \nEfficient road  Average travel cost on  Government\u2019s \nSurvey of RDA \ntransport in the  national highways linking  development strategy \nsouthern region  the expressway network  effectively coordinated \nreduced by 20% from 2012  with road sector \nrate  investment \nOne road project with high  Report of the Ministry of  Ongoing and planned \nimplementation readiness  Finance  projects implemented \napproved to improve  as scheduled \nexpressway connectivity \nOutcome  By 2018:    Assumptions \nImproved road  Travel time on project  Project performance  Public transport system \nconnectivity between  roads reduced by an  monitoring system of  in Metro Colombo area \nthe expressway  average 20%  RDA  is improved adequately \nnetwork and the local  by government and \nSurvey of RDA \ntransport network in  relevant development \nthe southern region     partners \nAccident rate on project  Report of traffic police  Government, private \nroads reduced by 10%  financiers, and \nfrom 2011 rate  development partners \nprovide resources to \nMovement of people and  Survey of RDA \ntransport sector \ngoods on project roads \nincreased by 15% from \n2012 rate \nOutputs  By 2018:    Assumption \n1.
