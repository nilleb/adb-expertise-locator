INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Lao People\u2018s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to \nsupport preparation of a human resource development (HRD) strategy, including the required \nanalytical  work.1 HRD  is  a  top  priority  for  socioeconomic  development  as  reflected  in \ngovernment policy and plans. In this regard, the government is planning to prepare an up-to-\ndate and evidence-based HRD strategy to help meet national development priorities that include \nreducing poverty, accelerating the achievement of Millennium Development Goal targets, and \nmoving out of least-developed country status by 2020. The TA is included in ADB\u2018s country \noperations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for the Lao PDR, as a firm 2012 policy and advisory TA \n(formerly entitled Education Reform Support Facility).2 During the 1\u20135 October 2012 fact-finding \nmission, the government and ADB agreed on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost estimates and financing plan, and terms of reference for consultants. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The long-term development agenda of the Lao PDR is to achieve a market-oriented \nopen  economy  and  orient  the  country  to  industrialization  and  modernization.  Development \npriorities include support for economic growth and reduction of poverty and inequality. However, \nthe government faces several development challenges. More than 75% of workers continue to \nbe engaged in agriculture, suggesting that economic growth has not created jobs in industries \nand services. With a human development index of 0.524, the country ranks 138th out of 187 \ncountries.3 Labor productivity in agriculture is far less than in nonagriculture sectors. In particular, \nthe lack of skilled human resources and low worker productivity are binding constraints to \neconomic growth and diversification. The labor force does not meet the requirements of the \ngrowing economy. The general population has an average education of about 4 years; this is \neven lower among ethnic groups and women. Education and training systems need to be more \nclosely  linked  to  enterprises  and  businesses.4 Strengthening  HRD  is  essential  to  poverty \nreduction, service delivery improvement, and economic development.  \n \n3.  Three challenges influence the development and utilization of human resources in the \nLao PDR. First, the population is projected to increase by 25.0% by 2030, from 6.2 million in \n2010 to 7.8 million in 2030, growing at an annual rate of 0.9%\u20131.5%. The population growth will \nbe accompanied by a shift in the population age structure with the working age population (15\u2013\n64 years old) increasing: on average, every year until 2022, 92,000 people will join the working-\nage population. Second, the Lao PDR is experiencing significant in- and out-migration, with \nlabor exports being primarily unskilled, and imports being primarily skilled or semiskilled workers. \nWith an integrated Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic community in \n2015, movement of skilled labor is anticipated to increase.5 This would give the Lao PDR\u2018s labor \n                                                \n1 The Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) prepared the concept paper for the HRD strategy, which was \npresented at the National Education Reform Committee on 12\u201313 January 2012 and submitted to ADB\u2018s contact \nmission during 31 January\u20133 February 2012.

This would put greater \npressure on local workers to compete. Third, the pattern of economic growth in the Lao PDR will \nresult in large sectoral shifts\u2014a shift from agriculture to nonagriculture, such as industry and \nservice\u2014while improving agricultural productivity; and from rural to urban areas, where the \nyounger generation, in particular, will seek jobs. \n \n4.  The government\u2017s first HRD strategy in 2000 identified socioeconomic development \ngoals, and overall human development targets for 2001\u20132020.6 While the strategy included \nefforts to strengthen the country\u2018s human resources, the present and future socioeconomic \ndevelopment priorities and needs have not been met. The strategy was not adequately informed \nby analytical work and resulted in unrealistic HRD targets. To date, no systematic assessment \nof the strategy has been completed; its underlying assumptions and issues are no longer valid. \nThe scope for improving policy coherence, strengthening institutional coordination, avoiding \nduplication and fragmentation, and optimizing the use of resources is considerable. The HRD \nstrategy  needs  to  be  updated  to  address future  challenges.  However,  the  capacity  of the \nMinistry of Education and Sports (MOES), which is mandated to prepare the new HRD strategy, \nis inadequate to prepare and disseminate a new strategy. It needs to be strengthened in terms \nof  managing  the  process  of  preparing  and  disseminating  a  new  HRD  strategy,  including \ncoordination and liaison with key ministries and development partners concerned with HRD. \n \n5.  Development of the HRD strategy requires an integrated and multifaceted understanding \nof eight factors: (i) population and demographics; (ii) national socioeconomic development and \nits regional links; (iii) current and future labor market issues, including migration factors and \nreview of labor laws; (iv) income distribution and poverty reduction; (v) human development \n(including gender and ethnicity gaps); (vi) constraints in skills development at all levels of \neducation; (vii) assessment of the institutional capacity of stakeholders; and (viii) potential public \nand private partnerships in HRD. However, most of these factors are not sufficiently integrated. \nInstead, each tends to be confined in its own separate field under the purview of different \ninstitutions with specific budgets and other resource constraints. The fact that these factors are \nnot harmonized and integrated into the national development agenda provides a compelling \nrationale to update and reformulate the HRD strategy. \n \n6.  The importance of HRD for socioeconomic development is highlighted in the most recent \npolicy of the Lao People\u2018s Revolutionary Party. In 2011, the party adopted a slogan of four \n\u2015breakthroughs,\u2016  including  a  \u2015breakthrough  in  HRD\u2016  by  creating  dynamic  higher-quality \neducation  and  developing  skilled  labor  and  technicians.7 This  requires  improvements  in \nknowledge, skills, and capacity of all citizens, and a qualified workforce to meet the demands of \nnational socioeconomic development. The Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan \n(NSEDP), 2011\u20132015 aims to achieve at least 8% economic growth, diversify and deepen \neconomic activities, significantly improve human capital, increase labor productivity, and reach \nout to marginalized and vulnerable groups of the population. HRD is one of the seven strategic \ndirections  in  the  seventh  NSEDP,  and  is  also  one  of  seven  strategic  goals  in  the  Lao \nSocioeconomic Development Plan for 2020, especially to improve the quality and relevance of \n                                                \n6  Government of the Lao People\u2018s Democratic Republic. 2000. Human Resource Development Strategy 2020. \nVientiane (in Lao language). \n7  Another three breakthrough slogans are (i) \u2015breakthrough in imagination,\u2016 by turning from central-oriented to \nmarket-oriented under management of the government; (ii) \u2015breakthrough in regime and administrative rules,\u2016 by \nmaking the administration and public services more effective and transparent; and (iii) \u2015breakthrough in poverty \nreduction,\u2016 by mobilizing funds and implementing special policy. See Government of the Lao People\u2018s Democratic \nRepublic. 2011. Report of the 8th Party Central Committee to the IXth Congress. Vientiane. \n ", "  3 \nskills of the labor force. While HRD is a crosscutting theme of national development, policy \ncoherence and institutional coordination to support HRD are lacking. The preparation of the new \nHRD strategy will guide HRD dimensions in the eighth NSEDP for 2016\u20132020, to be prepared \nby the government. \n \n7.  The formulation of the HRD strategy is consistent with the overarching objective of \nADB\u2018s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  the  Lao  PDR,  which  aims  to  promote \ninclusive and sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.8 The TA will complement \nmeasures to improve human capital by addressing persistent gaps in education access, quality, \nrelevance,  and  low  efficiency  as  reflected  in  the  Lao  PDR  education  sector  assessment, \nstrategy, and road map.9 ADB is currently providing support to secondary education, technical \nand  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET),  and  higher  education.10 Thus,  ADB  is  well \npositioned to support government efforts in preparing the HRD strategy and facilitate dialogue \namong development partners. The HRD strategy of the Lao PDR will be linked to the Greater \nMekong Subregion HRD Strategic Framework and Action Plan, 2013\u20132017.11 \n \n8.  Gaps in various HRD-related studies and surveys need to be addressed to provide a \ncomprehensive analysis for the new HRD strategy.12 In particular, the World Bank prepares the \nLao HRD report,13 using the household survey of skills toward employment and productivity \n(STEP) which will provide a baseline skills profile in preparing the eighth NSEDP.14  Because \nthe survey focuses on urban and rural households with road access, data from rural households \nin remote areas are also needed. The World Bank is also supporting a similar survey for firms, \nfocusing on the specific skills and knowledge needed by employers. This survey will not collect \ninformation related to central and provincial government needs. A skills demand and supply \nforecast study is also needed using more systematic and reliable methodology to forecast \ndemand and supply of skills.  \n \n9.  For education and the labor market, the World Bank is supporting a tracer study of TVET \ngraduates, while ADB is supporting a tracer study of higher education graduates.15 The World \nBank is also supporting an institutional analysis of TVET and higher education institutions, and \noutgoing and incoming migration study. ADB is expected to support a within-country migration \nstudy. \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

The impact will be strengthened human resources to support national socioeconomic \ndevelopment priorities. The outcome will be an endorsed national HRD strategy. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA has four outputs. \n \n12.  Output  1:  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports  management  and  coordination \ncapacity  strengthened.  The  TA  will  support  MOES  in  managing  the  preparation  and \ndissemination of the HRD strategy, including coordinating and liaising with key ministries and \ndevelopment  partners  such  as  ADB,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development, \nGerman development cooperation through GIZ (German Agency for International Cooperation), \nthe International Labour Organization, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the United \nNations Development Programme, and the World Bank. The TA will map out and review HRD \nstudies and surveys to identify needs and measures to address them, including an assessment \nof the 2000 HRD strategy. \n \n13.  Output 2: Human resource development studies and surveys completed. The TA \nwill support selected HRD studies and surveys related to education and skills development, \nfilling gaps in existing and planned HRD studies and surveys, and complementing the work \nsupported by the World Bank\u2018s Lao HRD report (footnote 13). Support will include (i) STEP skills \nhousehold survey targeting rural households in remote areas, (ii) public sector survey focusing \non the government\u2018s central and provincial personnel skill needs, (iii) skills demand and supply \nforecast study, and (iv) labor migration study focusing on within-country migration. \n \n14.  Output 3: Human resource development strategic framework developed. The TA \nwill help develop an integrated HRD strategic framework to (i) guide the achievement of a more \ncohesive education and training sector, and (ii) improve linkages between the supply side \n(education and life-long learning) and the demand side (utilization) of HRD. The HRD strategic \nframework will include multisectoral strategic thrusts; the TA will support the development of \nseveral strategic thrusts in the education and training sector.  \n \n15.  Output 4: Human resource development action plan completed. The TA will help \ndevelop the HRD action plan comprising the elements of organization, legislation, information \ndissemination and communication, indicative cost and financing requirements, and monitoring \nand  evaluation  mechanism.  The  HRD  action  plan  will  be  aligned  with  the  HRD  strategic \nframework and strategic thrusts, covering the same period (2016\u20132020) as the eighth NSEDP. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $900,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2018s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, remuneration of counterpart staff, \nutilities, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency; MOES will be the implementing agency. A national \nsteering committee for HRD strategy, to be chaired by the minister of education and sports, and \ncomprising vice ministers from key ministries and deputy provincial governors, will oversee TA \nimplementation.16 It will provide policy and program directions to ensure effective coordination \namong ministries and agencies, development partners, and other stakeholders; and will endorse \nthe national HRD strategy. A national coordination committee for HRD strategy, to be chaired by \nthe MOES vice minister, will coordinate the TA work with ADB, the consultant team, regional \nand  local  research  institutes,  development  partners,  and  other  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned; and be the focal point for selecting studies and surveys to be supported by ADB and \nother development partners. MOES, through its Department of Planning, will serve as the \nsecretariat  of  the  national  coordination  committee  for  HRD  strategy.  The  TA  outputs  and \nactivities will be planned and delivered in a participative and inclusive manner to ensure broad-\nbased ownership and support as well as sustainability of TA benefits. \n \n18.  ADB will engage an international consultant (about 12 person-months) and a national \nconsultant (about 18 person-months) individually in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  They will have expertise in project \nmanagement and coordination, HRD strategy formulation, and HRD action plan preparation and \ndissemination. Based on experience, track record, and involvement in key HRD-related ongoing \nstudies such as STEP skills surveys and public sector surveys, ADB will engage Indochina \nResearch Lao (IRL),17 a local research institute, using single-source selection in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. It will also engage a regional research institute \nusing  consultants\u2018  qualifications  method  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants, to conduct studies on forecasts of demand and supply of skilled workers, and on \nthe comparative advantage for the country\u2018s labor force. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2018s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA will be implemented from January 2013 to December 2014. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2018s Democratic Republic for Support for the Human Resource \nDevelopment Strategy, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n16  The national steering committee and the national coordination committee will be created by a prime ministerial \ndecree which is anticipated to be passed in early 2013. Unless and until the prime ministerial decree is approved, \nthe existing National Education Reform Committee will be the steering committee, and the existing Technical \nWorking Group for the Preparation of the HRD Strategy will coordinate the work.  \n17 IRL is a social research company engaged in conducting the World Bank STEP skills surveys. ADB and the World \nBank will use the same sampling methodology and survey tools in conducting HRD-related studies and surveys to \nensure the validity and consistency of findings. IRL is the only firm in the country with experience in STEP skills \nsurveys. The cost for HRD studies and surveys to be managed by IRL is not expected to exceed $100,000.
