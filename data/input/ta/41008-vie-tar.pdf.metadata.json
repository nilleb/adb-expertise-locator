INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Viet Nam's offshore natural gas reserves are estimated at 400 billion cubic meters (m3). \nGas production in 2005 was 6.5 billion m3 and is expected to reach 15 billion m3 by 2010. \nCurrently, production is concentrated in the Nam Con Son basin off the southeast coast, with \nmost of the gas produced being used to generate power in the Ba Ria and Phu My thermal \npower plants. \n \n2.  From 2009 to 2012, the Government of Viet Nam will commission four power plants at \nthe O Mon power complex1 with a total installed capacity of 2,760 megawatts (MW).2 O Mon I \npower  plant  (600  MW)  is  under  construction  with  assistance  from  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC). O Mon III (660 MW) power plant is being developed by \nElectricity of Viet Nam (EVN), for which international competitive bidding began in October 2006. \nEVN is now undertaking technical evaluation of the bids and the contract is expected to be \nawarded in May 2007. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting EVN in developing O \nMon IV power plant and also with the preparation for competitive bidding of O Mon II power \nplant  to  the  private  sector.  All  four  power  plants  will  ultimately  be  operating  as  gas-fired \ncombined-cycle power plants, subject to availability of gas. O Mon I and O Mon III will initially \noperate using fuel oil and will convert to gas once it is available. The commissioning of these \npower  plants  has  created  a  demand  for  4.3  billion  m3  of  gas  per  year  and  justifies  the \nconstruction  of  a  pipeline  to  transport  gas  from  an  offshore  field  being  developed  by  a \nconsortium of international oil companies led by Chevron3 of the United States. The pipeline, \nwhich will have both offshore (278 kilometers [km]) and onshore (103 km) sections, is to be in \nplace by end-2010 to meet the tight commissioning schedule of the power plants. \n \n3.  Given  the  situation,  the  Government  has  requested  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA) from ADB to prepare the Support for the Public-Private Development of the O \nMon Gas Pipeline Project. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam from 4 to 8 December \n2006 and held discussions with PetroVietnam (PV), Ministry of Industry (MOI),  Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, State Bank of Viet Nam, and Chevron. The Mission reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  cost  estimates,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Viet Nam's gross domestic product has grown at 7.5% per annum over the last 5 years \nand is envisaged to grow at about 8% per annum during 2006\u20132010. This will result in an \nelectricity  demand  growth  of  about  15%  per  annum.  The  Government's  current  Power \nDevelopment Master Plan projects electricity demand to grow at 16% per annum during 2006 to \n2010, slowing down to 11% per annum during 2011\u20132015 and then at 9% per annum toward \n2025. To meet this increase in demand, about 30,000 MW of new generating capacity is \nrequired from 2006 to 2015.5 \n                                                 \n1  The O Mon power complex is located in O Mon district of Can Tho province, about 200 km southwest of Ho Chi \nMinh City. \n2  O Mon I unit 1 (300 megawatts [MW]) is scheduled for commissioning in 2009 and unit 2 (300 MW) will be \ncommissioned in 2011; O Mon II (750 MW) will be commissioned in 2012, O Mon III (660 MW) in 2009, and O Mon \nIV (750 MW) in 2011. \n3  Chevron owns 42.38%; Mitsui Vietnam Petroleum, 25.62%; PetroVietnam Exploration & Production, 23.50%; and \nPTT Exploration, 8.5%. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 January 2007.  \n5  As of 31 December 2006, almost 14,600 MW of installed generating capacity are at various stages of construction \nor investment decisions have been made. The total comprises 6,200 MW generated from hydropower, 2,800 MW \nfrom gas power, and 5,600 MW from coal-fired power. \n ", "2   \n5.  At  present,  Viet  Nam's  power  system  is  heavily  dependent  on  hydropower,  which \naccounts for almost 40% of the total generating capacity. During the dry season, power from \nhydro plants decreases significantly due to low water levels in the reservoirs. Consequently, \npower shortages occurred during the dry season in the last 3 years. To rectify the imbalance \nbetween hydro and thermal power generation, an increase in the thermal power generating \ncapacity is essential. Half of the planned generation capacity additions (15,000 MW) will be \nthermal-based (to diversify away from hydropower). Of that volume, 8,000 MW will be generated \nwith gas, for which the O Mon power complex will account for 2,760 MW.  Among other benefits, \nthe use of gas for generating power will substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \ncompared with other fuel alternatives (coal and fuel oil for example). \n \n6.  PV is responsible for all activities related to the oil and gas industry in Viet Nam, from \nupstream  production  of  oil  and  gas  to  downstream  activities,  such  as  transportation  and \ndistribution. At present, PV has production sharing contracts with a number of international oil \ncompanies operating in several offshore oil fields. These oil fields also produce associated gas. \nThe field from which the O Mon power complex will receive gas is estimated to have sufficient \nreserves to provide gas for more than 25 years. \n \n7.  PV, in joint venture with foreign partners, is already operating two gas pipelines. The first \nis the 400 km Nam Con Son pipeline that transports gas to the Phu My power complex.6 The \nsecond pipeline transports associated gas from the White Tiger field to Baria Vung Tau.  PV is \nnow constructing in the southwest a third pipeline (280 km) that will supply gas to the Ca Mau \npower and fertilizer complex.  PV has been operating gas pipelines for the past 5 years and has \ngained considerable operational experience.  \n \n8.  A significant contribution from the O Mon gas pipeline will be the generation of electricity \nfrom a cleaner energy source by using domestic natural gas. In the absence of the gas pipeline \nproject,  the  O  Mon  power  plants  would  use  coal  or  fuel  oil,  which  would  have  serious \nimplications for GHG emissions. In addition to serving the O Mon power complex, the proposed \npipeline will provide gas for the Tra Noc power plant (Can Tho city) and other industrial gas \nconsumers in the vicinity. Together with the existing gas pipelines, the O Mon pipeline will play \nan important role in meeting the growing gas demand in southern Viet Nam. \n \n9.  The O Mon power complex is a potential project for the clean development mechanism \n(CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. The CDM is a market-based financial instrument that assists \ndeveloping countries to achieve sustainable development and industrialized countries to meet \ntheir  emission  reduction  targets.  The  difference  in  GHG  emissions  between  the  baseline \n(without the project) scenario and the project scenario will generate certified emission reduction \nunits that can be used by industrialized countries to comply with their commitments under the \nKyoto Protocol. These emission reductions could also be used to meet other commitments \nsubsequently adopted outside the Kyoto Protocol. \n \n10.  Before  construction  of  the  pipeline  starts,  PV  must  first  reach  agreement  with  the \nGovernment on (i) gas price and volume of off-take by EVN, (ii) the structure of the pipeline's \nownership  and  operation,  (iii)  economic  and  financial  viability  of  the  pipeline,  (iv)  pipeline \nspecification  and  routing,  (v)  its  social  and  environmental  impacts,  and  (vi)  operation  and \nmaintenance  procedures.  The  feasibility  study  prepared  for  the  pipeline  covered  project \neconomics, and financial and technology aspects, but did not investigate in depth possible \nownership structures of the pipeline; nor did it evaluate the environmental and social aspects of \nthe project. To address the gaps, the Government requested ADB to assist in conducting  due \ndiligence to confirm the project's viability, verify the project cost estimates, develop possible \n                                                 \n6  ADB's private sector department provided financing for Phu My 2 and Phu My 2.3. The Phu My power complex has \na total installed generating capacity of 2,000 MW and uses natural gas as fuel. \n ", "  3\npipeline ownership structures, and prepare the necessary safeguard documents for a possible \ninvestment loan. \n \n11.  Past experience demonstrates that ADB support has been a catalyst in fostering public-\nprivate cooperation in Viet Nam\u2019s power sector. PV has also been working for a long time with \nprivate sector developers in the offshore gas fields. With expanding operations in the oil and gas \nsector, public-private partnerships are becoming even more important. The proposed TA would \nfurther strengthen PV's capacity to work effectively with foreign partners. It would also facilitate \nnegotiations on the pipeline ownership and reduce the risk of such negotiations not producing \nan effective result. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The main impact of the TA will be the availability of reasonably priced domestic natural \ngas for generating power at the O Mon power complex. That will be achieved by constructing a \n381 km pipeline to transport gas from an offshore field to be developed by international oil \ncompanies led by Chevron. This project will help Viet Nam secure a more balanced power \ngeneration  mix  (increasing  the  share  of  power  generation  by  gas  and  reducing  that  by \nhydropower), thus ensuring a more reliable electricity supply especially during dry season. In \naddition, the TA will assist PV with developing environmental and safety good practices in off-\nshore  gas  production,  transportation,  and  operation.  The  TA  will  support  public-private \npartnerships  by  examining  various  ownership  structures  for  the  pipeline.  The  TA  will  also \ncontribute to lowering GHG emissions from the power sector in Viet Nam. Without the gas \npipeline and the natural gas supply, the sector would generate electricity using more carbon- \nintensive fuels in less efficient power plants. Overall the far-reaching impact of the TA will be \nmeeting  the  increasing  electricity  demand  that  fuels  economic  growth  in  an  economically \nefficient  and,  locally  as  well  as  globally,  environment-friendly  manner  by  utilizing  domestic \nenergy resources. The ultimate outcome of the TA will be a successful investment decision to \nconstruct the gas pipeline based on a full and comprehensive assessment (technical, financial, \neconomic, social, and environmental) of the proposed project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will conduct a full assessment of the proposed pipeline project and propose \nmeasures to ensure that the project meets ADB's economic and financial viability criteria and \nsafeguard policies. Specifically, the TA will (i) review the gas pipeline\u2019s feasibility study to \ndetermine if the project is technically, economically, and financially viable; (ii) determine the \nleast cost and environmentally and socially suitable option for the pipeline route; (iii) review \nengineering  designs  and  develop  procurement  packages;  (iv)  determine  the  extent  of \nunexploded ordnance (UXO) in the selected alignment (both onshore and offshore); (v) assess \nresources needed to undertake UXO clearance in the project area and draft broad terms of \nreference for such work; (vi) review financing options for the pipeline that has been proposed in \nthe original feasibility study including possible public-private partnerships, and recommend an \nappropriate ownership structure; (vii) assess PV's capacity to operate the pipeline and the need \nto further develop such capacity; (viii) determine the scope of work of  consulting services for \nconstruction supervision and develop broad terms of reference for such services; (ix) prepare a \ndetailed resettlement and compensation plan based on the selected pipeline routing including \naccess roads and other associated facilities; (x) estimate the likely  reductions in GHG emission; \nevaluate and develop the potential downstream power projects for certified emission reductions \nand develop these under the CDM; and (xi) prepare an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nreport, a summary EIA (SEIA) report, and a costed environment management plan. The TA will \n ", "4   \nalso assess any possible impacts on the indigenous and ethnic minorities in the project area \nand prepare an ethnic minority development plan, if necessary. \n \n14.  ADB will use the final TA outputs in considering the provision of a loan to PV for \nconstruction of the pipeline. PV will use the TA findings in finalizing its feasibility study to be \nsubmitted to the Government for approval. \n \n15.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environment Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), the TA will conduct an EIA and prepare an EIA report, an environment \nmanagement plan, and SEIA.7 Public consultation will be carried out during the preparation of \nthe EIA and the SEIA report.  \n \n16.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies in Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995), Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and Gender and Development (1998), the TA will \nassess the resettlement and other impacts arising from the construction of the pipeline and \ninclude these impacts and remedial measures into the resettlement plan. The summary initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,095,000. The Government has requested that \nADB provide $975,000 to cover most of the TA cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Viet Nam will \nprovide counterpart staff, office space and facilities, technical feasibility studies, environmental \nreports, and support services. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 3. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be PV and the Implementing Agency (IA) will \nbe the O Mon Gas Pipeline Management Board (OGPMB). The TA will require about 29 \nperson\u2013months of international and 25 person-months of national consulting services. Individual \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2006, as amended from time to time). The consultants will be working in close collaboration \nwith each other and under the direct supervision of Infrastructure Division of the Southeast Asia \nDepartment (SEID). The staff responsible for the TA will discuss the terms of reference (TOR) in \ndetail with the consultants, explain their respective outputs, and monitor their progress to ensure \nthe delivery of cohesive and comprehensive outputs that address all issues and are adequate \nfor processing a subsequent investment loan. The TA will be implemented over 6 months \nstarting in late March 2007 and ending in August 2007. The outline TOR for the consultants are \nin  Appendix  4,  while  the  detailed  TOR  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  Purchase  of \nequipment will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from \ntime to time) and equipment procured will be handed over to the Government at TA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The  President,  acting  under  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $975,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Support for the Public-Private Development of \nthe O Mon Gas Pipeline Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n7  In preparing the safeguard documents, geotechnical and social surveys may be undertaken. Drilling to take core \nsoil samples and test groundwater for contamination will be undertaken.

Viet Nam\u2019s success in bringing down the \npercentage of the population below the poverty line from 70 in 1990 to 27 in 2005 is based on rapid but equitable \neconomic growth recorded during that period. The availability of cheap and reliable electricity generated from \nindigenous sources is an essential requirement for sustaining economic growth and maintaining the international \ncompetitiveness of the Vietnamese economy as it makes the transition from an agriculture-based to an industrialized \neconomy. For example, during the period 2000\u20132005, electricity consumption grew at almost 15%, contributing to 7.5 \n% growth of the gross domestic product. Viet Nam has also put emphasis on creating nonfarm employment \nopportunities for its rural population by providing rural infrastructure including access to electricity.
