However, it must also meet the need for a significant \nprogram of capacity building1 if the initiatives are to achieve all their  intended benefits.  This \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  was  proposed  to  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  and \nendorsed in February 2004.  From 20\u201330 April 2004, the ADB Fact-Finding  Mission  visited \nThailand to formulate the TA, and Cambodia on 3 May 2004. In Cambodia, the Mission was \nassured of the Government\u2019s concurrence with the goal, purpose and outputs, methodology and \nkey activities, cost and financing, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nTA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Tonle Sap ecosystem3 is (i) the main source of animal protein for much of the \npopulation of Cambodia, owing to the productive fisheries of the Tonle Sap Lake; (ii) a direct \nand irreplaceable source of livelihoods for more than 1 million people living on and around the \nTonle Sap Lake; (iii) a seasonal breeding and nursery ground and forage area for fish that \nsubsequently  migrate  to  the  Mekong  River;  and  (iv)  an  environmental  hotspot  of  global \nsignificance. The Tonle Sap basin is home to 32% of Cambodia's total population. It covers 38% \nof Cambodia's total land area. It is also a reservoir from which water drains, in the dry season, \nto  control  salinity  intrusion  and  conserve  mangrove  in  the  Mekong  delta.  However,  high \npopulation growth is increasing the number of people to feed and consumptive use of the Tonle \nSap basin\u2019s resources is intense. Threats to the Tonle Sap Lake include over-exploitation of \nfisheries and wildlife resources, encroachment during the dry season, and cutting of the flooded \nforest. In the watersheds, degradation of natural vegetation is destroying habitats and results in \ndeterioration of water and soil quality and increased siltation rates. Despite the inherent richness \nof the lake, most indicators of poverty in the basin are worse than those of the national \npopulation as a whole. King Norodom Sihanouk has warned that Cambodia faces environmental \ndisaster if the Tonle Sap ecosystem is degraded further. \n \n3.  In line with the  National Poverty Reduction Strategy, 2003\u20132005 and the program \nformalized in the poverty partnership agreement between the Government of Cambodia and \nADB,4 the country strategy and program, 2005\u20132007 for Cambodia will highlight the Tonle Sap \nbasin. In July 2003, in support of the country strategy and program, the Tonle Sap Basin \nStrategy was formulated.5 The suite of loans and TAs that will execute it, known as the Tonle \nSap Initiative (TSI), makes demands on the human and social capital of many stakeholders, \nincluding  line  agencies,  local  government  bodies,  communities,  research  institutes, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other elements of civil society. However, human and \nsocial capital had been diminished by 25 years of strife. A multi-year, integrating instrument is \n                                                 \n1  Capacity building is development of the abilities of individuals, groups, and organizations to complete critical tasks \neffectively and efficiently on a sustainable basis. It is the process of assisting such entities to identify and address \nissues and gain the insights, knowledge, and experience needed to solve problems and implement change. To be \nmeaningful in the long term, capacity building is best done as part of a process, rather than as an end in itself. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 February 2004. \n3  The Tonle Sap ecosystem is the permanent core area of the Tonle Sap Lake and the surrounding floodplain, within \nthe boundaries constituted by the upper flood lines. It includes the Tonle Sap River, its branches, and floodplain. \n4  The agreement requires that the partners develop a strategy for the Tonle Sap region, concentrating on improving \nthe sustainability of its ecosystems. \n5  ADB. 2003. Fighting Poverty in Cambodia: The Tonle Sap Basin Strategy. Manila. The development objectives of \nthe Tonle Sap Basin Strategy are to foster, promote, and facilitate (i) pro-poor, sustainable economic growth; (ii) \naccess to assets; and (iii) management of natural resources and the environment. \n ", "2 \nneeded that builds skills and awareness, networks knowledge, and strengthens partnerships in \nand beyond Cambodia to generate ever-higher returns from the TSI. \n \n4.  ADB wishes to draw on the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) to support the TSI.  In \nJune 2002, to make possible poverty reduction in the face of limited capacity, ADB and AIT \nestablished  a  networking  arrangement.6  The  arrangement  aims  to  (i)  provide  AIT  with \nopportunities to disseminate its expertise, and (ii) augment ADB's access to know-how so that \nADB may use, or enable its developing member countries to use, resources better to meet the \noverarching goal of poverty reduction. Networking activities include (i) sharing information; (ii) \ncommissioning of studies and surveys; (iii) organizing joint activities; (iv) undertaking capacity \nbuilding activities for officials of developing member countries of ADB and staff of ADB; and (v) \nextending operational assistance to ADB activities as mutually agreed. The focal areas of the \nnetworking  arrangement  cover  rural  livelihoods,  natural  resources  and  the  environment, \ninformation technology, water resources, energy, and gender. The networking arrangement can \nassist the TSI.7 The TA makes no major assumptions and presents no major risks. The \nsustainability of the TA is not an issue: it is not coterminous with the networking arrangement, \nwhich  is  not  finance-driven.  Opportunities  for  scaling  up  and  systemic  impact  are  also \nconsiderable by virtue of the TA's association with the TSI. The TA will be the first substantive \ncollaboration between ADB and AIT under the arrangement. It will complement and expand the \nPhnom  Penh  Plan  for  Development  Management.8  Even  so,  acquisition,  absorption,  and \napplication  of  knowledge  take  time:  continuing  assistance  beyond  TA  completion will be \nworthwhile, building on successes and lessons learned. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n5.  The goal of the TA is sustainable management and conservation of natural resources \nand biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. Its purpose is to build at national, provincial, and local \nlevels capacity to manage, engage in, and support the TSI. Three accomplishments will achieve \nthe  TA's  purpose:  skills  and  awareness  will  be  built,  knowledge  will  be  networked,  and \npartnerships will be strengthened. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  Building Skills and Awareness. To accomplish this output, key activities will (i) review \nthe TSI; (ii) identify a reasonable cross-section of the stakeholders involved in it; (iii) ascertain \nthe deficiencies in skills and awareness that limit their ability to fulfill agreed or potential roles; \n(iv) design and deliver, with the backing of AIT Extension,9 educational products and services \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Networking with the Asian Institute of Technology. Manila. \n7  The Tonle Sap Basin Strategy emphasizes resource cooperation because of the Tonle Sap Lake's  regional \nimportance. AIT's multidisciplinary and multinational nature lends itself to the regional reach of the TSI; its proximity \nto Cambodia is another advantage. \n8  The Phnom Penh Plan is a new human resource development initiative under the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) economic cooperation program. It will train officials from the six participating countries in strategic planning, \nproject management, community mobilization, and other skills central to development management and good \ngovernance. \n9  AIT Extension provides continuing education to meet professional development needs. Its areas of expertise are in \n(i) rural livelihoods; (ii) natural resources and the environment; (iii) management; (iv) information technology; (v) \neducation; and (vi) infrastructure. \n ", "    3 \nand add to national capacity to do so by training of trainers;10 (v) monitor the efficiency and \neffectiveness of skills and awareness building based on an agreed monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E) system, including general and specific indicators; and (vi) feed the results of M&E back \ninto the process for provision of customized educational products and services. Skills and \nawareness building will aim to strengthen the managerial and leadership capacity of core \ngroups of motivated and competent change agents associated with the TSI: they are junior and \nmiddle  government  officers11  and  community  leaders  and  representatives.  (Related \nstakeholders will be included if practicable.) Skills and awareness will be built through the \nmedium of four training programs of about 3 days each, to be delivered 70 times12 in all in \nPhnom Penh and in the provinces of the Tonle Sap basin. The training programs will be based \non AIT Extension\u2019s existing programs in  management of rural poverty alleviation projects, \nenvironmental and natural resources planning and management,13 effective rural leadership, \nand participation in government and civil society. The subject matter of these training programs \nbest matches the immediate generic issues faced by the TSI. Wherever possible, the training \nprograms will build on existing skills and include TSI case studies. They will also underscore the \nimportance of gender considerations. \n \n 7.  Networking Knowledge. To accomplish this output, key activities will establish, equip, \nand operate a Tonle Sap office in AIT. The office will be housed in the cell associated with the \nnetworking arrangement to promote the purposes of that TA and to build synergies. These \nfacilities include office space, filing and storage systems, and office equipment. The Tonle Sap \noffice will be a clearinghouse of information about the Tonle Sap basin and, where relevant, the \nMekong  River  basin.  Personnel  now  working  in  the  cell  associated  with  the  networking \narrangement  will  staff  the  office.  The  repository,  the  Tonle  Sap  database,  will  be \nmultidisciplinary, gathered from within and outside Cambodia, and updated regularly,14 and will \nbe open to all, including students and  professionals researching or working for  sustainable \nmanagement and conservation of natural resources and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. In \nparticular, for AIT, the office will facilitate formulation of customized educational products and \nservices for skills and awareness building tuned to the particular circumstances of the Tonle \nSap basin. It may also open up other opportunities for AIT to assist the TSI. For ADB, it will \nprovide inputs to decision-making on related loans and TAs and associated partnerships. \n \n                                                 \n10 Training of 20 trainers over 2 weeks in AIT and their involvement in skills and awareness building would allow \ndelivery of  the four training programs in the Khmer language and enable wider coverage during and after TA \nimplementation. \n11 So far, the larger line agencies associated with the TSI include the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; \nthe Ministry of Economy and Finance; the Ministry of Environment; the Ministry of Interior; the Ministry of Land \nManagement, Urban Planning, and Construction; the Ministry of Public Works and Transport; the Ministry of Rural \nDevelopment; and the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology. \n12 The estimate of 70 deliveries assumes 30% of deliveries by AIT and 70% by the trained trainers. \n13 This training program will also be designed in part on lessons from ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Promoting \nEffective Water Management Policies and Practices (Phase 3). Manila, under which a pilot and demonstration \nactivity for Developing and Testing Environmental Education and Awareness Methodologies and Tools was \napproved in February 2004. \n14 The database will comprise publications, project documents, technical papers, and conference proceedings and \nreports. ADB and AIT will contribute much of this data. Other data can be procured through subscriptions to \njournals and newspapers, periodic Internet searches, agency mailing lists, and library networks. Data stored \nelectronically will be accessible in distilled form through the Internet, with links to existing and prospective \ndatabases. The latter include the  Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve Environmental Information Database to be \nestablished under  ADB. 2002.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Environmental \nManagement Project. Manila. \n ", "4 \n8.  Strengthening Partnerships.  To accomplish this output, key activities will (i) review \nADB's collaborative arrangements under the TSI; (ii) identify  opportunities to strengthen and \nadd to them; (iii) enhance channels for structured dialogue informed by the Tonle Sap database; \n(iv) draw an action plan for partnerships; and (v) elaborate TA concept papers to give them \npractical expression. The scope will encompass, but not be limited to, bilateral and multilateral \ninstitutions as well as NGOs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $307,000 and a local currency cost of $283,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $193,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nfrom the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. The Government will finance the balance of the \nlocal currency cost, equivalent to $90,000, through the provision of remuneration and per diem \nof counterpart staff; supply of data, maps, and reports; and administrative support. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, acting through a TSI coordination unit to \nbe established under the TA in ADB's Cambodia Resident Mission.15 TA implementation will \nrequire a TSI coordinator and a deputy for 6 person-months of international and 24 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services, respectively. They will be engaged individually. From \nthe TSI coordination unit, they will provide direction and impetus to TA implementation, network \nactively to drive outputs, monitor overall accomplishments closely on behalf of ADB, and \ngenerally help the TSI. They will have primary expertise in management and institutional \ndevelopment and secondary expertise in knowledge management. They will be familiar with the \ncircumstances  of  the  Tonle  Sap  basin,  such  as  its  poverty-environment  nexus.  The  TSI \ncoordinator will have advanced leadership, managerial, diplomatic, and negotiating skills and a \nhistory of managing for results. The lead provider of services to build skills and awareness will \nbe AIT, which will design, deliver, and direct the educational products and services according to \nAIT\u2019s rules and regulations in consultation with the TSI coordinator and the deputy. AIT is the \nmost  qualified  and  competent  agency  to  act  as  lead  provider  of  services  based  on  its \nexperience, capacity, and commitment and it will be appointed by direct selection. A domestic \nservice provider will be required to manage the logistics of skills and awareness building, ensure \ncorrespondence with cultural dynamics, and facilitate M&E.16 All consulting services required for \nthe TA will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  All \nequipment, goods, and works required for the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. The TA will be implemented over a 2-year period, from September \n2004 to September 2006. An indicative activities and staffing schedule is in Appendix 3. Terms \nof reference, including M&E and reporting requirements, are in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n15 The unit will share the premises of the Learning Resource Center. The Center was set up under the Phnom Penh \nPlan to enable public access to ADB and Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) databases. It will house a library of \nhard texts and electronic files and an Internet facility that will network across the six GMS countries, Phnom Penh \nPlan partners, and development institutions. It will establish and maintain Phnom Penh Plan web site. \n16 VBNK, a Cambodian institute offering training for capacity building and organizational development, will  be \nappointed by direct selection. VBNK is a Khmer language acronym for \u201cTraining Institute for Managers of \nOrganizations Working for the Development of Cambodia.\u201d \n ", "    5 \n11.  Delivering a broad range of skills and awareness building to a wide target audience is \nnot easy. Therefore, an executing committee will be established to facilitate TA implementation, \nreflect stakeholder interests, and publicize the schedules of  training programs. The committee \nwill be chaired by the Council for Agriculture and Rural Development (representing most line \nagencies). The Council is a high-level body established to coordinate ministries, facilitate policy \nformulation and implementation, and harmonize external assistance. The Prime Minister chairs \nit. The committee will include the Cambodia National Mekong Committee (representing the line \nagencies concerned with management of the Mekong River and related natural resources and \nresponsible for basin planning that recognizes the interconnectedness of social, economic, and \nenvironmental factors), the Department of Local Administration within the Ministry of Interior \n(representing  the  interests  of  local  government  and  responsible  for  implementing  the \nGovernment's  decentralization  program),  and  the  NGO  Forum  on  Cambodia  (representing \nNGOs and  acting on behalf of networks such as the  Centre d'Etude et de D\u00e9veloppement \nAgricole Cambodgien and the Fisheries Action Coalition Team). The deputy TSI coordinator will \nact as secretary to the executing committee. The executing committee will meet every 3 \nmonths. \n \n12.  The TA is allied to the networking arrangement, a key objective of which is to broaden \nthe basis of dissemination of information: the TA's deliverables17 will therefore be disseminated \nthrough AIT's and ADB's information networks. In ADB, these include the Tonle Sap Initiative \nBrochure and the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project web site. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nCapacity Building for the Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction Initiative, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n \n

Monitoring Results-Oriented Training \n \n11.  Training (or skills and awareness building) is a necessary but usually not sufficient tool \nto use together with others. For that reason, one should pay attention to the \"why\" of training \nand not just to its \"how\". In a word, training serves to fortify or inculcate the knowledge, skills, \nand  attitudes  that  an  institution  (or  individual)  needs  to  achieve  results.  If  planning  and \nimplementation  of  training  is  focused  on  improving  the  performance  of  an  institution,  the \n                                                 \n4  Likely sources of male and female trainees include the Royal Agricultural University, the Royal University of Phnom \nPenh, the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, and national nongovernment organizations. \n ", "14  Appendix 4   \nlikelihood of achieving intermediate results will be enhanced. To configure an M&E system that \nlinks training to a goal and higher-level result, one should therefore ask the following questions: \n(i)  Higher-level result. What changes in the performance of the institution will \ncontribute to the goal? \n(ii)  Institution-level  results.  What  kind  of  performance  will  be  required  of  the \ninstitution in order for it to attain the higher-level result? \n(iii)  Group-level results. What does an analysis of the human resource capacity of \nthe institution reveal about the performance requirements needed to achieve the \ndesired results? \n(iv)  Training results. What gaps in performance can be addressed by training? \n \n12.  Once these questions have answered, the M&E system can then be configured based \non the illustrative framework outlined in Table A4.1: \n \nTable A4.1: Monitoring Results-Oriented Training \n \nGoal  Higher-Level  Institution- Group-Level  Training \nLogical Chain \nResult  Level Results  Results  Results \nResult  Sustainable  Improved  Improved  Improved trainee  Trainees \nmanagement  performance of  performance of  performance  demonstrate the \nand conservation  institutional  institution  Training is  skills, \nof natural  cluster  applied at the  knowledge, and \nresources and  workplace or in  attitudes \nbiodiversity in  the community  acquired \nthe Tonle Sap \nbasin \nGeneral Indicator  The stakeholders  Capacity to  Capacity to  Training is  Trainees master \ninvolved in the  manage, engage  manage, engage  applied and  new skills and \nTSI are benefited  in, and support  in, and support  shared at the  knowledge and \nas planned  the TSI is built at  the TSI is built at  workplace or in  demonstrate \nthe national,  the institutional  the community  attitudes \nprovincial, and  level \nlocal levels \nSpecific Indicator  TBD  TBD  TBD  TBD  TBD \nTimeline  5\u20138 years  4\u20136 years  2\u20133 years  6 months  Upon completion \nof training \nRole of Training  Component  Indirect plausible  Direct plausible  Directly linked to  Directly linked to \nin Achieving  attribution  link, given critical  link, given critical  training  training \nResult  assumptions  assumptions \nTBD = to be decided, TSI = Tonle Sap Initiative. \n \n2.

Meaningful specific indicators will detail (i) satisfaction levels; (ii) acquisition of new \nskills, knowledge, and attitudes; (iii) application of learning; and (iv) changes in performance. \nThey will permit disaggregation by gender. When configuring the M&E system, however, it will \nbe important to specify also who needs to know such results and how they are to be collected in \na cost-effective way. \n \nF.  Reporting Requirements \n15.  Tonle Sap Initiative Coordinator. The TSI coordinator will produce an inception report \nwithin 2 weeks of the commencement of the TA and a midterm report detailing TA outcomes \nand recommending actions within 12 months of the start of TA implementation. The TSI \ncoordinator will also prepare brief monthly progress notes for review by ADB, AIT, and the \nexecuting committee. These notes, which should not exceed three pages, are intended to keep \nthe parties informed of input-to-output progress and constraints impeding TA implementation. \n \n16.  Deputy Tonle Sap Initiative Coordinator. The deputy TSI coordinator will assist the \nTSI coordinator to meet reporting requirements in the first year of TA implementation. In the \nsecond year of TA implementation, the deputy TSI coordinator will assume full responsibility for \nreporting requirements and produce a draft final report and final report detailing TA outcomes \nwithin 23 months and 24 months, respectively, of the start of TA implementation. The final report \nwill (i) describe TA outputs, the capacity built, and the achievement of targets; (ii) review the \nperformance of AIT, paying particular attention to analysis of background data; appropriateness \nof the approach and methodology; initiative, flexibility, and innovation; design solutions; skills \nand awareness building functions; understanding of procedures; adherence to the terms of \nreference; compliance with the work program; presentation of results; quality of reports; and \ncompetence and conduct of experts; (iii) incorporate feedback from partners; and (iv) identify \nlessons learned and provide recommendations for follow-up actions. \n \n17.  Asian Institute of Technology. AIT will produce (i) a work program for skills and \nawareness building within 2 months of the commencement of the TA, and (ii) individual M&E \nreports upon delivery of each batch of educational products and services. The work program will \ninclude an approach and methodology, an organization chart, a time schedule, a detailed work \nplan, a staffing schedule for delivery of educational products and services, and the biodata of \nthe staffs proposed. It will detail an M&E system. The main text of the work program will be \nlimited to 10 single-sided pages. The biodata will be limited to 5 single-sided pages. AIT will also \nprepare brief progress notes every 2 months for review by ADB, the TSI coordination unit, and \nthe executing committee. These notes, which should not exceed three pages, are intended to \nkeep  the  parties  informed  of  input-to-output  progress  and  constraints  impeding  TA \nimplementation. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20040830082714+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20040816160732Z", "Title": "Tscb--22.doc", "Creator": "Tscb--22.doc - Microsoft Word", "Author": "ADB", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT"}}
