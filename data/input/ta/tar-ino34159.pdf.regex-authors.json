For  the  2002\u20132004  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for  Indonesia,  the \nGovernment requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) \nto  prepare  a  proposed  second  road  rehabilitation  project  (the  Project).  The  Project  is  to \nrehabilitate some of the most deteriorated links of the country road network, to induce economic \ngrowth in order to reduce poverty. The Project will also assist the Government to follow up on its \naction plan for implementing road traffic and transport policies, which was suspended during the \nfinancial crisis and has been resumed now under the ongoing first Road Rehabilitation Sector \nProject (RRSP),1 and strengthen its institutions to facilitate policy implementation. The RRSP is \nprogressing  satisfactorily.  It  is  a  sector  type  loan  that  covers  road  links  requiring  urgent \nrehabilitation in 17 provinces. Given the RRSP is spread over a large number of provinces, only \na limited number of links can be included in each province. The second road rehabilitation \nproject  is  therefore  envisioned  to  be  a  project  type  loan,  targeted  to  rehabilitate  strategic \nnational  routes  in  the  islands  of  Kalimantan  and  Sumatra  only,  which  could  not  be \naccommodated under the RRSP. The Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission) was fielded in May \n2002. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government on the goals, purpose, \nscope, cost, time frame, financing, implementation arrangements, and the terms of reference for \nconsulting services for the TA.2 The preliminary project logical framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The  latest  five-year  plan  (PROPENAS)  for  Indonesia  places  high  priority  on  the \ndevelopment of infrastructure within overarching objectives of national unity, good governance, \neconomic  growth,  and  poverty  alleviation.  The  plan  particularly  stressed  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation of existing facilities as part of infrastructure development. The road rehabilitation \nrequirements remain high in many provinces of Indonesia. The Government has identified Aceh, \nCenter Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, Jambi, Lampung, North Sumatra, Riau, South Kalimantan, \nSouth Sumatra, West Kalimantan, and West Sumatra as priority provinces for intervention in the \ntransport sector in the fiscal years 2002\u20132004. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Policy Issues.  Since 1976, ADB has supported the Government\u2019s efforts to develop the \nroad sector and remove road capacity constraints. ADB assistance is geared to help economic \nrecovery  and  thus  reduce  poverty.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  Asian  economic  crisis,  the \nGovernment  has  been  preoccupied  with  addressing  the  urgent  issues  of  macroeconomic \nstabilization, financial sector restructuring and bank recapitalization, and augmentation of the \nresources  for  social  safety  nets.  In  the  process,  the  road  sector  has  received  insufficient \nbudgetary allocation, and the road network has suffered considerably from lack of adequate \nmaintenance. Vehicle overloading is also contributing to the very poor condition of the road \nnetwork. Approximately 70% of the road pavement damage is caused by about 5-10% of \nvehicles, which are overloaded trucks. \n \n4.  Capacity constraints and accessibility are also problems in many parts of the road \nnetwork. In Kalimantan, in particular, there are heavy volumes of traffic and congestion near the \nurban centers, and road links to remote areas are carrying low traffic volumes but are in urgent \nneed of substantial improvement to avoid economic and social isolation of local economies. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nIndonesia for the Road Rehabilitation Sector Project. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in June 2002. ", "2  \n \n5.  To help sustain economic recovery, the Government is reprioritizing domestic resources \nto rehabilitate and preserve the existing road network, in particular critical road links that support \neconomic activities and serve poor areas. The Government intends to introduce a system of \nroad user charges to increase the sources of funding for road maintenance and rehabilitation. \nMeasures have been also discussed to reduce vehicle overloading. However, the political and \neconomic situation has delayed the implementation of these needed policy reforms.  \n \n6.  The ongoing decentralization process has complicated road preservation and policy \nimplementation. The lack of institutional and financial capacity of local governments to finance \nroad works and implement the Government policies and plans in a number of areas, including \nvehicle overloading, road safety, and vehicle emission controls, is among the major issues \nfaced by the road sector. The impact of decentralization on the budget of local governments and \ntheir ability to contribute to counterpart funding and repay ADB loans is another issue. In the \nabsence of adequate on-lending arrangements, it was agreed that the work under the proposed \nloan will comprise only national roads, which are funded totally by the central Government. \nOnce onlending arrangements are finalized, it will be possible to consider lending to sub-\nnational roads. \n \n7.  Finding solutions to these problems is of great concern to the Government. To improve \nthe situation and address it in a sustainable way, coordination between concerned agencies, \nsuch as the provincial administrations, Directorate General of Regional Infrastructure (DGRI), \nDirectorate General of Land Communications (DGLC), and police is essential.  It also requires a \nmore effective enforcement of the regulations. \n \n8.  The Government is making progress in addressing road policy issues, but it needs \nfurther institutional strengthening and capacity building to achieve its goals. Domestic resources \nare currently insufficient to preserve all major roads that are in urgent need of rehabilitation, and \nthe Government has to rely on external assistance. \n \n9.  ADB  has  coordinated  with  other  funding  agencies  involved  in  the  road  sector,  in \nparticular the World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, to ensure that ADB \nefforts will be complementary with, and not duplicate or overlap, any ongoing or expected \nactivities. \n \n10.  Poverty  Reduction,  Environmental,  and  Social  Issues.  The  road  links  to  be \nrehabilitated present different terrain conditions, and traffic characteristics. Some are high traffic \nvolume links, which are easily economically justifiable; some have low traffic volumes but high \npoverty reduction and developmental impacts or form part of strategic networks, but are more \ndifficult to justify purely on economic grounds. Economic internal rate of return is still the key \ncriterion to govern investment decisions. However, road rehabilitation priority should be based \nnot only on economic return, but also take into account pro-poor benefits such as increased \nattendance at school and better access to health and other social facilities in the served areas. \n \n11.  Environmental conditions vary considerably across the road network. Special attention \nmust be paid to identify environmentally sensitive areas, and environmental criteria should be \ntaken into account in prioritizing road links for rehabilitation. Should any land acquisition and \nresettlement be necessary, the TA consultant will prepare the necessary resettlement plans in \naccordance with the ADB's Handbook on Resettlement, to mitigate the impact. Similarly, the TA \nwill address indigenous people issues, if any, according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n \n   ", "  3\n12.   Technical Issues. The Indonesian integrated road management system (IRMS) and \nstrategic  expenditure  planning  module  (SEPM)  software  model  remain  key  tools,  for  the \nassessment, evaluation, and cost estimate preparation of road works. The TA consultant will \ncarry  out  a  diagnostic  review  to  check  the  consistency  of  data  input  requirements  and \ncorresponding outputs, the model applicability per link, and any adjustments required. The traffic \ndata for low trafficked links also needs to be verified, especially for Kalimantan. Growth rates for \nroad traffic should be differentiated where appropriate by links or at least by province, instead of \napplying a generalized growth rate to all links in IRMS-SEPM, as currently used by DGRI.  \n \n13.  Traffic data is sometimes inconsistent between sources and years, and is difficult to \nreconcile, especially in Kalimantan. For instance, the year 1999 data, where it existed, was \nmore accurate than 2000 data. Time series data should therefore be conducted to cross-check \ndata for individual years. \n \n14.  In  view  of  the  policy,  social,  environmental,  financial,  and  technical  issues  on  the \ntransport sector, the proposed TA will help the Government to address some of these issues \nand prioritize future investment plans.    \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n15.  The TA will assist the Government in formulating an investment project for strategic road \nrehabilitation/upgrading  in  Kalimantan  and  Sumatra  islands.  The  purposes  will  be  to  (i) \nrehabilitate or upgrade high priority links on the national road network to facilitate economic \nrecovery and reduce poverty; and (ii) help revise road traffic and transport policies by reviewing \nthe Government\u2019s Action Plan for Road Traffic and Transport Policies. The TA will assess policy \nimprovements required to support future investments.  \n \n16.  The TA will select priority road links in Kalimantan and Sumatra and prepare feasibility \nstudies of the prioritized road links requiring investment. The TA output will include (i) a program \nof road link rehabilitation and associated activities prepared for subsequent design and funding \nthrough external assistance; (ii) preparation of a transport sector policy component; and (iii) \nterms of reference for consulting services and other documents for preparing future funding. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  From a long list of about 1,900 kilometers (km) of priority and strategic national road \nlinks proposed by the Government, the TA will select about 1,500 km to be rehabilitated under \nthe Project. The proposed rehabilitation works will combine road rehabilitation and upgrading, \nand bridge reconstruction or replacement. The TA will select the road links to be rehabilitated on \nthe basis of a set of criteria developed in consultation with the Government and ADB. The \ncriteria will include technical, economic, environmental, social,  and poverty reduction aspects.   \n \n18.  To  determine  prioritized  road  links,  the  selection  methodology  needs  to  reflect \ncircumstances including areas served by the links and a range of technical, social, economic, \nenvironmental, and traffic characteristics. However, the economic internal rate of return will \nremain the key criterion used in the selection process. IRMS-SEPM inputs and outputs will be \nreviewed using field surveys and adjusted as necessary, in particular data on road conditions, \ncurrent traffic volume, and forecasts. Criteria should be consistent with the ones used in the \n ", "4  \nRRSP,  and adjusted as required based on lessons learned from the RRSP. The proposed links \nwill  be  evaluated  to  determine  the  appropriate  type  of  rehabilitation  works  required.  Initial \nenvironmental  examinations  will  be  conducted  on  all  selected  links  to  identify  critical \nenvironmental  issues,  determine  environmental  category,  and  identify  the  need  for \nenvironmental impact assessments.  An initial poverty and social impact assessment will also \nbe carried out for all selected links.   \n \n19.  Road links proposed under the long list will include (i) portions of the strategic trans \nKalimantan south and Sumatra east coast routes, which are not well connected due to missing \nlinks or deteriorated conditions; and (ii) strategic links of Sumatra west coast. These routes are \nused mainly by heavy vehicles transporting goods and agriculture products across national (and \ninternational) borders, and from local plantations to factories. They also are the main links \nconnecting the provinces and carry relatively large volumes of interprovincial passenger traffic, \nespecially in Sumatra. The current annual average daily traffic ranges between 100 to 5,000 \nvehicles in Kalimantan and 3,000 to 8,000 vehicles in Sumatra. The low traffic on some routes \nin Kalimantan is because some road sections are badly deteriorated. \n   \n20.  The successful implementation of the Government's Action Plan for Road Traffic and \nTransport Policies will be key to the sustainability and long-term development of the road sector.  \nThe TA will specifically identify mechanisms and resources, such as a road fund, for the routine \nmaintenance of the national road network to complement activities undertaken under the RRSP. \nFurthermore, the TA will review and report on other issues such as vehicle overloading, which is \nmore  problematic  in  some  provinces  (e.g.,  Riau)  than  in  others;  road  safety;  and  vehicle \nemissions. It will facilitate policy development and implementation, and help identify equipment \nrequired to assist the Government to implement and enforce the action plan in all provinces, in \nconsonance with the RRSP. The TA will make specific recommendations on the needs for \ncapacity building, to be properly addressed in future assistance proposed for the sector.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.125 million equivalent, of which $697,000 is \nthe foreign exchange cost and $428,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $900,000 equivalent, which is the entire foreign exchange cost \nand about 47% of the local currency cost, or $203,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $225,000  equivalent  in  kind,  through  the \nprovision of counterpart staff, office accommodation, transport in the field, secretarial and office \nsupport,  and  translation  services.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and  proposed  financing \narrangements are in Appendix 2. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  DGRI under the Ministry of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA. However, DGLC should be closely associated to the TA component related \nto road policies. \n \n23.  The TA will require a total of 76 person-months of consulting services (25 person-\nmonths of international and 51 person-months of domestic services). The TA consultants will \nhave expertise in (i) road engineering, (ii) transport and development economics, (iii) road \ntransport policy, (iv) environmental impact analysis, (v) resettlement and social impact analysis, \n   ", "  5\n(vi)  poverty  analysis,  (vii)  traffic  studies,  and  (viii)  institutional  strengthening.  A  team  of \nconsultants from an international consulting firm, in association with domestic consultants, will \nbe engaged by ADB using the simplified technical proposal procedures, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (Quality and Cost Based Selection), and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The proposals \nwill be evaluated on the basis of qualifications and experience of the required experts, one of \nthe main experts being the team leader. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n24.  Suitable counterpart staff from DGRI will be assigned to the day-to-day implementation \nof the TA. DGRI will provide administrative and technical support to the consultants, including \noffice accommodation (suitably furnished and equipped) and communications facilities, and will \nensure that all documents, data, maps, and information relevant to the TA are provided to the \nconsultants in a timely manner. DGRI will, in particular, ensure coordination with DGLC so that \nall documents related to the road policy component are provided in due time to the consultants.  \nAll  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with \narrangements satisfactory to ADB and turned over to DGRI on completion of the TA.  \n \n25.  The TA is expected to commence in February 2003 and be completed in 7 months, by \nthe end of August 2003.  An inception report will be prepared for consideration by ADB and the \nGovernment 1 month after commencement of the TA. An interim report will be prepared within 3 \nmonths of TA commencement, comprising the draft list of road links for funding and highlighting \nkey issues and findings. The draft final report will be submitted at the end of month 5. Tripartite \nmeetings between the Government, ADB, and the TA consultants will be held two weeks after \nsubmission of each of the reports. The final report will be issued before the end of month 7, \nincorporating all comments made by DGRI and ADB.  \n \n26.  The TA consultants will prepare all reports in full coordination with DGRI.  DGRI and \nADB will review and provide comments to the consultants within 2 weeks of submission of the \nreports.  Comments of ADB and DGRI will be taken into account in the work program and \nreflected in subsequent reports.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a \ngrant basis to the Government of Indonesia for Preparing the Second Road Rehabilitation \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nPROJECT LOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \n       \nGoals \n \n1.

Scope of Work \n \n1.  The  feasibility  studies  under  this  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  cover  about  1,900 \nkilometers (km) of roads on Kalimantan and Sumatra (trans Kalimantan south route, Sumatra \neast-coast route, and Sumatra west coast strategic links). The Project is to rehabilitate about \n1,500  km  of  strategic  national  links  (to  be  determined  after  the  necessary  studies  are \ncompleted).  \n \n1.  Work Sequence  \n \n2.  The consultants will achieve the objectives of the TA by adopting a staged approach to \nthe  tasks  and  requirements.  The  consultants  should  refer  to  the  criteria  in  the  Road \nRehabilitation Sector Project (RRSP) and lessons learned from their implementation and other \ndocumentation and reports, as a useful starting point in developing the screening criteria under \nthe TA. All activities under the TA should be conducted in full consultation and involvement of \nthe Executing Agency, the Directorate General of Regional Infrastructure (DGRI). \n \n(i)  Month 1: Developing a methodology to formulate selection criteria based on the \neconomic,  costs  and  environmental  [which  links  would  require  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) report] and social impacts. Initiate field surveys \nof all the road links to verify accuracy of field data on the two islands and prepare \nthe inception report. \n \n(ii)  Month 2: Complete the field and traffic surveys of the proposed links and initial \nscreening  of  the  road  links  following  the  agreed  criteria.  Evaluate  road \nmaintenance needs and risks of illegal logging through proposed road links.  \n \n(iii)  Month 3: Produce a preliminary list of all links by order of priority, including draft \nfirst year program. Prepare a draft scope for the traffic and transport sector \npolicies  component  and  the  interim  report,  to  be  presented  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and DGRI  for approval. \n \n(iv)  Month  4:  Collect  further  data  through  additional  surveys  as  necessary  to \ncomplete the feasibility studies: technical, economic, environmental, social, and \npoverty impact evaluation etc. Develop criteria and perform a baseline survey, in \naccordance with ADB requirements outlined in paragraph 20.  \n \n(v)  Month 5: Finalize the selected road links for rehabilitation under the Project, \ncomplete feasibility studies and identify the program to be implemented in the \nfirst  year,  and  prepare  overall  project  scope  for  the  draft  final  report  to  be \ndiscussed and agreed upon during the last tripartite meeting. \n \n(vi)  Month  6:  Finalize  the  total  road  rehabilitation  program  and  complete  all \nremaining tasks incorporating any comments made during the tripartite meetings, \nand finalizing the reports, including IEE and summary IEE for subprojects for \npresentation to DGRI and ADB. \n \n                                        ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(vii)  Month 7:  Issue the final report.  \n \n2.  TA Outputs \n \n3.  The main outputs of the consultant\u2019s study will comprise: \n \n(i)  a preliminary list of road links resulting from applying the selection criteria, \n \n(ii)  a program of highway link rehabilitation and associated activities prepared for \nsubsequent design and funding under the proposed loan, \n \n(iii)  preparation of a transport sector policy component, and \n \n(iv)  documents and terms of reference (TOR) required for future loan processing and \nimplementation. \n \nB.  Main Tasks \n \n  1.  Task 1\u2014Physical Work Component Comprising Road and Bridge Works  \n \n  a.  Economic Evaluation \n \n4.  The economic evaluation of project components will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB guidelines for economic evaluation. Usual techniques to measure the net economic worth \nof investment are appropriate and the consultants should ensure that all subprojects achieve an \nacceptable economic internal rate of return. The consultants will define the \"with\" and \"without\" \nproject  scenarios  for  the  economic  analysis,  and  the  economic  life  of  each  type  of  road \ninvestment should be determined.  \n \n  5.  Most of the proposed links are on strategic routes and should not require development \nbeyond the existing rights of way. The links and their catchments comprise a wide range of \nphysical,  socioeconomic,  environmental,  and  traffic  characteristics.  The  physical  links  and \nrelated terrain conditions in Kalimantan are substantially different from those in Sumatra. The \nconsultants must reflect such differences in their economic methodologies. \n \n6.   The consultants will review and verify available input data to be used in the integrated \nroad management system (IRMS) and strategic expenditure planning module (SEPM), road \nconditions, traffic volumes, and traffic forecasts. Based on the field surveys, IRMS-SEPM output \nreviews and verifications, the consultants are required to prepare new forecasts for some links, \nupdate (and modify as necessary) the forecasts for the other road links, and conduct additional \neconomic  evaluation  of  links  as  required,  using  models  such  as  Highway  Design  and \nMaintenance Standards Model.  \n \n7.  The methodology will also need to include a means to establish if, and by how much, \ntraffic currently using other modes (river transport, etc.) would transfer to the rehabilitated links. \n \n  b.  Environmental Impacts \n \n8.    Environmental assessment will be  (i) done in  accordance with ADB  guidelines and \ngovernment regulations and the rapid environmental assessment checklist for roads; and (ii) in \ncompliance with the Indonesian national standards of environmental and social assessment.  \n   ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n \n9.  The consultants will (i) prepare screening criteria, methodology, considering subproject \ncost, and cut-off limit and apply them to determine which links require IEE; and (ii) prepare the \nIEEs. The subprojects that are above the established cut-off limit and those that will anticipate \nsignificant environmental impacts will require ADB review. Generally, links that will require IEE \nare those that: (i) pass through protected forests or ecologically sensitive areas; (ii) require land \nacquisition; (iii) involve substantial road rehabilitation work, or (iv) are predicted to give rise to \nnegative environmental impacts. \n \n10.  Environmental evaluation requires review of these aspects for each link, and determining \nmitigation plans where such plans and measures are required.  \n \n  c.  Poverty and Social Analysis and Impacts \n \n11.  The  consultants  will  ensure  that  poverty  issues  and  impacts  avoidance  are  fully \nconsidered in link selection. For this purpose, the consultants will prepare an initial social \nassessment,  indicating  for  each  considered  link,  based  on  the  initial  survey  (i)  land \nacquisition/resettlement  impacts  and  families  and  people  affected;  (ii)  whether  indigenous \npeoples will be affected; and (iii) type of land acquisition/resettlement and indigenous peoples \nplans needed.1 The consultants will also assist DGRI to establish a social development unit to \nbe fully involved in project preparation and implementation. \n \n12.  For all selected links (subprojects), the consultants will (i) carry out investigations for the \npoverty and social analysis (PSA), and (ii) prepare a PSA report based on the ADB's Handbook \non Poverty and Social Analysis and project team requirements to ensure that pro-poor aspects \nare to be fully considered in the prioritization and selection of link roads. Based on existing \nnational, regional, and local statistics, the PSA will, for the project and each subproject, (i) \nprovide a socioeconomic and poverty profile and a stakeholder analysis after conducting a rapid \nparticipatory assessment, and (ii) analyze the relationships between poverty and livelihood, \ntrade, and transport patterns in project areas. The consultant will prepare a study on the \ndevelopment needs of poor communities along the road links to be rehabilitated, especially in \nwest and central Kalimantan. The study, in full consultation with local governments and other \nstakeholders,  will  examine  constraints  to  development  and  poverty  reduction,  recommend \nactivities that could be implemented as part of the project, and provide a preliminary estimate of \nrelated costs. The consultant will calculate the poverty impact ratio of the Project using ADB's \nguidelines. \n \n13.  The  consultants  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples \npolicies and project team requirements in preparing: (i) a compensation policy framework and \nprocedural  guidelines  setting  land  acquisition/resettlement  compensation  provisions  and \nimplementation procedures for the whole project; (ii) a  land acquisition/resettlement plan for \neach  link  for  which  it  is  needed;  and  (iii)  an  indigenous  peoples  policy  framework  and \ndevelopment plan for each link for which it is needed.  \n \n  d.  Technical Aspects \n \n14.  To meet the technical requirements of the study, the consultants will survey all relevant \ntechnical aspects of the proposed program for funding, including:  \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1998. Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. Manila. \n                                        ", "12  Appendix 3 \n(i)   a visual survey of the conditions of road links and bridges, including pavement \nand drainage, road width, right of way, and specific problems of failure; and \n \n(ii)   design  criteria  and  specifications,  including  geometric,  cross  section,  design \nspeed, vertical and horizontal alignment, and subsurface properties. \n \n15.  The consultants will review the existing standards as a basis for technical screening and \ndesign of the first year road links (to be done by others).  \n \n16.  The consultants should cover the following aspects:  \n \n(i)  Propose  civil  work  packages  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nguidelines and considering field conditions; and \n \n(ii)  Recommend  possible  use  of  innovative  technologies  such  as  recycling  of \nasphalt, aging resistant bitumen, and locally available binder materials. \n \n17.  The consultants will prepare the necessary standard documents for implementation of \nthe first year program, including prequalification documents.  \n \n  e.  Risk Analysis \n \n18.  Several risks will be common to many subprojects. However, as the Project comprises a \nnumber of widely differing types of road in differing areas of the country, the consultants should \ninitially identify the major economic and other uncertainties that may reduce each subproject's \nviability. A suitable risk analysis model should be used if appropriate. The consultants will be \nexpected to justify fully the decision to use or not use a model. \n \n19.  The consultants are therefore required to ascertain the economic or related uncertainties \nthat  could  affect  the  Project\u2019s  viability  and  sustainability,  through  a  risk  analysis. \nRecommendations on how to mitigate and allocate the identified risks will be required. \n \n  f.  Baseline Survey Report \n \n20.  Baseline surveys will allow effective monitoring of the Project and assessment of the \nimpact of reducing poverty in the area of influence. For poverty and social impact assessment, \nthe baseline survey criteria may include surveying the number and income levels of people \nserved, degree of rehabilitation/upgrading of the proposed links, and estimated costs of the \nlinks.  The  consultants  will  plan  and  prepare  baseline  surveys  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements, and these will relate to pro-poor benefits (not incorporated in the cost benefit \nanalysis), traffic, environmental, and other relevant indicators. Such indicators (quantifiable and \nnonquantifiable) should include average travel speed and time; vehicle operating costs; district \nincome and employment levels; prices of consumer and producer commodities; daily traffic \nvolumes by traffic type; bus services and frequencies; social, education, and health facilities; \nand health indicators.  \n \n2.  Task II\u2014Traffic and Transport Policy Component \n \n21.  The  TA  will  identify  mechanisms  and  resources  to  reduce  road  deterioration  and \nincrease road revenues, such as establishing a road fund for the routine maintenance of the \nnational road network. Similar activities undertaken or planned by the Government and other \n   ", "  Appendix 3  13 \nagencies will be reviewed and analyzed. The TA will examine the needs for capacity building \nand the recommendations will need to be properly addressed in any future assistance to the \nsector. The TA will facilitate policy development and implementation, help identify equipment to \nhelp implement the proposed policy framework to implement and enforce the action plan in all \nprovinces. \n  \n22.  The review should consider the adequacy of the existing policy framework and assess \nareas including, but not limited to, regulation, reform, and law enforcement; private sector \nparticipation in road transport facilities; and management information systems. The TA will \nreview and report on other policy-related issues such as vehicle overloading, more problematic \nin some provinces (e.g., Riau)  than in others; road safety; and vehicle emissions.  \n \n3.  Task  III\u2014Consultant  Services,  Supervision,  Training,  Capacity  Building,  \nand Loan Processing \n \n23.  The consultants will describe detailed consultant services and appropriate supervision \nand training needs, and identify further TA needed. The consultants will prepare several TORs, \nfollowing discussions with Government and ADB, for future implementation. These will include: \n \n(i)  Consultant  services.  The  consultants  will  prepare  the  TORs  for  the  core \nsupervision team and design consultants, and for the field supervision teams.  \n \n(ii)  Training  and  capacity  building.  The  needs  will  be  identified  through \ndiscussions with relevant Government agencies. The consultants will prepare a  \nproposal for training and capacity building, including project management, road \nand bridge technology, a road maintenance and road safety awareness program. \n \n(iii)  National road database. The consultants will review the exercise of developing \na database of national road network. The TOR should reflect strengths and \nweaknesses of the existing system and proposals for improvements. \n \n(iv)  Other loan processing documents.  The consultants will provide documents \nneeded for processing the ensuing loan, as agreed with ADB. \n \nC.  Reporting Requirements \n \n24.  The  consultants,  in  full  consultation  with  DGRI,  will  prepare  the  required  reports \nincluding IEE and summary IEE (of selected road links) for timely submission. Comments of \nADB and DGRI made will be incorporated in the subsequent reports.  \n \nTable A3: Consultant\u2019s Reports \n \n  Number of Copies \nReport  Government  ADB \nInception  10  5 \nInterim   10  5 \nDraft Final   15  5 \nFinal   15  5 \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                        "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R333-02 (Read-Only) - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021206112507", "Title": "R333-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20021212113936+08'00'"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2002) \n \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Indonesian rupiah (Rp) \nRp1.00 =  $0.00011268 \n$1.00 =  Rp9,227 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  DGLC  \u2013  Directorate General of Land Communications \n  DGRI  \u2013  Directorate General of Regional Infrastructure  \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  IRMS  \u2013  integrated road management system \n  km  \u2013  kilometer \n  PCR  \u2013  project completion report \n  PROPENAS  \u2013  Pembangunan Lima Tahun (five year development plan) \n  PSA  \u2013  Poverty and Social Analysis  \n  RRSP   \u2013  Road Rehabilitation (Sector) Project  \n  SEPM  \u2013  strategic expenditure planning module \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  TOR  \u2013  terms of reference \n \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of: M.
