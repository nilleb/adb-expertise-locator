The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for preparing Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL) III that will \nimprove  access  to  finance  and  provide  a  broader  menu  of  financial  services  and  tailored \nfinancial instruments, backed by an appropriate market infrastructure, for developing a more \ncompetitive, stable, and broad-based financial system. A TA grant of $900,000 for FSPL III is \nincluded in the 2005 assistance program under ADB's 2003 country strategy and program \nupdate for Vietnam (2004\u20132006). The TA will form the basis for the FSPL III scheduled for 2007, \nwhich is the next phase of a medium-term development program that follows on from the \nongoing FSPL II.1 A TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam in July 2005 and had detailed \nconsultations with key stakeholders and the Government. This report reflects findings of the \nMission and understandings reached with the Government on objectives, scope, cost, and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since 1988, Viet Nam has adopted a wide range of reforms in an effort to transform its \neconomy  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-based  system.  In  recent  years,  the  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) has been growing by more than 7% annually and exports by roughly \n20%. The private enterprise sector already plays a significant role in the economy, generating \nover 40% of GDP and employing 30% of the workforce. However, the growth of most private \nenterprises continues  to  be  constrained  by  their  difficulties  in  accessing  finance,  receiving \nrecognition of land titles, and obtaining financial information.  \n \n3.  Financial intermediation is limited in Viet Nam today, and it is accomplished primarily \nthrough bank savings and lending. In an effort to enhance the means of financial intermediation, \nthe Government is undertaking financial and operational restructuring of the banking sector with \nassistance from World Bank and the International Monetary Fund under a poverty reduction and \ngrowth facility and a poverty reduction support credit. To complement this process, ADB is \nassisting  with  FSPL  II,  which  builds  on  the  achievements  of  FSPL  I3  and  supports  the \nGovernment's effort to develop alternative channels of financial intermediation. In implementing \npolicy reforms under FSPL II, the Government has shown strong commitment to carry the \nreform program forward. This momentum needs to continue in order to develop a diversified \nfinancial system for Viet Nam and so that the country\u2019s broad-based economic growth and \nsocioeconomic development objectives, including poverty reduction, can be achieved. The TA \nand the subsequent FSPL III in 2007 should facilitate this process.  \n \n4.  The nonbank sector, which includes leasing, insurance, and securities markets, remains \nsmall and limited in its role within the economy. While the growth potential for these subsectors \nis  excellent,  (the  insurance  subsector,  e.g.,  has  grown  by  an  average  annual  rate  of \napproximately 40% in recent years), its development is constrained by limited institutional and \nhuman capacity. As small and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow, it will be increasingly difficult \nto find means for financing their operations within the current system. There are reports of major \nstate-owned enterprises planning large bond issues, and municipal governments are exploring \nalternatives for funding their infrastructure needs. Thus, development of the nonbank sector, \n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \nCluster to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Financial Sector Program Loan II. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 16 September 2005. \n3  ADB.1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Financial Sector Program Loan I. Manila. ", " 2      \nand, in particular, the bond market, will be critical for such bodies to mobilize resources from the \nmarket and to provide the long-term funds and investment capital largely lacking in Viet Nam. \nDevelopment of these subsectors will also increase competition within the financial sector and \nthus pressure financial institutions\u2014banks in particular\u2014to improve their efficiency. \n \n5.  Until now, very little effort has been made to develop the bond market as an alternative \nmeans of capital formation for corporations. The money market is basically restricted to cash \ntransactions in the interbank market. The market is restrictive, and fragmented regulations \ninconvenience sellers and buyers while discouraging innovations. The Treasury now regularly \nissues directions for issuing treasury bills with maturities of 6 months, 9 months, and 364 days \nthrough the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV). However, much more needs to be done to develop \nthe  interbank  and  money  markets.  The  bond  market  mostly  comprises  Government  dated \nsecurities with 5\u201310 year maturities and with state-owned commercial banks and insurance \ncompanies as buyers. Currently, there are 21 members having exclusive rights in the primary \nmarket, but, unlike primary dealers in many developed markets, they do not necessarily perform \nthe role of market makers. Municipal bond issues have been very rare, and only two corporate \nbond issues are listed so far. Developing a market for bonds, and especially government bonds, \nis considered a top priority in the strategy to 2010 for building a securities market in Viet Nam.  \n \n6.  The insurance sector in Viet Nam has experienced remarkable growth over the past few \nyears. The gross premium grew by 48% in 2003 and 19% in 2004. In 2004, premium revenues \ntotaled D12.4 trillion, representing a penetration rate close to 2% of GDP. Despite impressive \ngrowth in the insurance market and government efforts to improve the regulatory framework and \nsupervisory capacity, there remain significant gaps to address in order to secure the sector\u2019s \nsound development and sustainability, such as to improve accounting and auditing regulations \nand standards, corporate governance, capital requirements, and supervision capacity. \n \n7.  An  accounting  and  auditing  system  is  being  developed  gradually  as  part  of  the \nfundamental infrastructure for building a sound and efficient financial sector. The Vietnamese \nAccounting Law was issued in 2003. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will require assistance to \nstrengthen the accounting standards and audit quality, taking into account the envisaged growth \nand demands of the aforementioned sectors during 2006\u20132010.  \n \n8.  The securities law, drafted under ADB TA 4035-VIE: Capacity Building for the Financial \nSector and Capital Market., is expected to be approved by the first quarter of 2006. Despite its \nhuge potential, the market has just 28 listed enterprises. That number remains too modest in \ncomparison with the number of joint-stock companies and total number of enterprises in Viet \nNam\u2019s economy. With a view to the strategic goal of developing a safe and efficient securities \nmarket to mobilize domestic and foreign capital for economic and social development, the State \nSecurities Commission (SSC) has prioritized a number of tasks and responsibilities. It has \nrequested ADB assistance in certain specified areas that would be consistent with the sector \nstrategy under preparation for 2006\u20132010.  \n \n9.  Leasing remains a small segment in the financial sector, with leased assets amounting \nto D5.4 trillion in 2004. The sector has not been able to meet the funding demand of the growing \nprivate sector. This can be ascribed to an inadequate regulatory framework (especially with \nregard to registering leased contracts and assets), lengthy and costly foreclosure procedures, \nlimited funding sources, the small range of products offered, and low public awareness of \nleasing operations. Some of these impediments are being addressed under FSPL II and the \nSME Development Program. Nevertheless, there remain some gaps.  \n ", "    3   \n10.  Follow-up support is now required for implementing the Law on Bills of Exchange, \ndrafted with assistance provided under ADB TA 4035, and expected to be approved by the end \nof 2005. Also needed is to develop specific bankruptcy decrees and regulations to govern \noperations of the financial and credit institutions, as the provisions existing under the bankruptcy \nlaw are more general and not specifically relevant to the financial sector. Deposit Insurance of \nViet Nam (DIV) needs to map out a new and sustainable long-term development strategy that \nclearly delineates its role and responsibilities to act as an independent agency and build up \nsufficient capacity to effectively function as a sustainable safety net for depositors. \n \n11.  Development of the social security system and housing finance industry\u2014two critical \nsegments of the nonbank sector\u2014are being assisted through two ADB TA projects.4 The \nprogress and outputs under these two projects will be reviewed to ascertain if further ongoing \nreforms should be included under FSPL III in 2007. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The main objectives of the TA are to (i) prepare the proposed FSPL III scheduled for \n2007; and (ii) assist Viet Nam to adopt measures that would lead to broader access to financial \nservices and a more competitive, diversified financial sector that reduces systemic vulnerability \nand meets the economy\u2019s immediate funding needs. The major outputs expected from the TA \nare plans and sequenced road maps to (i) enhance the future level of market-based financial \nintermediation, (ii) enhance the efficiency and reach of financial services and products, and (iii) \nstrengthen key institutions and human resources for the financial sector. \n \n13.  Money  and  Bond  Markets.  The TA will specifically build on available debt market \ndevelopment studies and help formulate a plan and sequenced road map to develop the money \nand debt markets. It will (i) help create a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework and the \nnecessary infrastructure for money and bond markets development; (ii) suggest measures and \nincentives to develop and stimulate an active interbank and money market; (iii) recommend \nmechanisms for establishing a sustainable government bond issuance and marketing strategy \nand a benchmark yield curve; (iv) assist in development of a secondary market for bond trading; \nand (v) suggest measures to facilitate real-time information and price discovery.  \n \n14.  Insurance. Assistance under the insurance component will (i) estimate the growth and \ndemands of the insurance sector for 2006\u20132010 through dialogues with the Government and \ninsurance industry; (ii) specifically support assessing technical and infrastructure requirements \nto set up a supervisory information system within the Insurance Department; (iii) adopt on-site \ninspection procedures and develop skills in reserves and solvency assessment and investment \nregulation;  (iv)  educate  the  industry  on  aspects  of  risk-based  capital  and  transition  to  full \nadoption of risk-based capital; (v) develop accounting standards and a unified chart of accounts \napplicable to insurance companies; and (vi) educate the industry on corporate governance \nconcepts and adoption of best practices in corporate governance of insurance companies, as \nconsidered appropriate. \n \n15.  Capital Markets. The TA will (i) support comprehensive implementation of the Securities \nLaw that has been drafted with ADB assistance and is expected to be approved in early 2006, \n                                                           \n4  ADB. 2003 Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Developing the Social Security System. \nManila.

", " 4      \n(ii) support capacity building for the Securities Training Center; and (iii) help develop a system of \ncriteria for supervising securities companies, fund management companies, etc. These activities \nwill be in line with the strategy developed for the sector for 2006\u20132010. The TA will also support \na diagnostic assessment of areas requiring further assistance and suggest measures to further \nstrengthen the securities market. \n \n16.  Accounting Policy and Standards. The TA will (i) include a review of the existing road \nmap  adopted  by  the  MOF  for  the  accounting  and  auditing  profession  and  suggest \nimprovements, if required, for Viet Nam to be in line with international standards; (ii) help draft a \nlaw on independent auditing and develop regulations needed to control the quality of auditing \npractice in Viet Nam, after ensuring that the required road map is in place and that global \nexperiences in this area are being taken into consideration; (iii) develop uniform accounting \npolicy and standards for commercial banks in line with international standards; and (iv) develop \naccounting standards for insurance companies and related implementation guidelines  \n \n17.  Leasing. This will (i) help identify mechanisms for promoting and supporting the use of \nfinancial and operating leases, including the accounting and tax aspects; (ii) recommend legal \nremedies for recourse on default lease assets; (iii) strengthen SBV in its monitoring of leasing \noperations;  and  (iv)  develop  the  framework  and  procedures  for  the  operation  of  finance \ncompanies. \n18.  Legal Areas of Assistance and DIV. This will include support to implement the Law on \nBills of Exchange (expected to be approved in early 2006) and develop specific decrees and \nregulations on bankruptcy governing the operations of financial and credit institutions within the \nexisting law on bankruptcy. In addition, the TA will support enhancing the legal basis for DIV to \nact  as  an  independent  agency,  helping  to  establish  a  time-bound,  sustainable  long-term \ndevelopment strategy that clearly delineates DIV\u2019s role. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n19.  The TA will help design the FSPL III scheduled for 2007 to enhance market-based \nfinancial intermediation for the private sector along with the efficiency and reach of financial \nservices and products. The consultants will confer in depth with the Government and private \nsector stakeholders to ensure the TA\u2019s outputs are practical within the Vietnamese economic \nand operational environment. Consultations and awareness-raising will be key to producing \noutputs and will include workshops and roundtable discussions as deemed appropriate.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost \nof $785,000 and a local currency cost of $365,000 equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB to provide $900,000 to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $785,000 and $115,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the remaining \n$250,000  equivalent  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  and  other  support  facilities.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n21.  SBV will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA and relevant departments within SBV, \nMOF and SSC will be the Implementing Agencies (IAs). A project steering committee to oversee ", "    5   \nTA implementation will be formed with representatives from the departments, agencies, and \nstakeholders concerned. In addition to office space, the EA and IAs will provide counterpart staff \nand other support services to the consultants. The EA will appoint a project director to assist in \ndaily implementation of the TA. \n \n22.  The  TA  will  require  26.5  person-months  of  international  and  21  person-months  of \ndomestic consultant inputs. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \nConsulting services will be provided by (i) a team of individual international and domestic \nconsultants, and (ii) an international consulting firm. Two individual international experts for 6 \nperson-months in total will be engaged for the insurance and accounting component while an \nindividual international information technology (IT) expert will be engaged for 2.5 person-months \nfor supporting the insurance and the debt market development components in the area of IT \ninfrastructure. Three domestic experts will be engaged for a total of 8 person-months to work \nwith the above-mentioned three international experts.  \n \n23.  The rest of the TA implementation will be contracted out to an international consulting \nfirm  for  18  person-months  for  international  and  13  person-months  for  domestic  consulting \nservices. The international consulting firm will engage a team of international securities market \nexperts for a total of 12 person-months for the debt and securities market component while the \nremaining  6  person-months  will  be  used  for  implementing  the  legal,  leasing,  and  DIV \ncomponents. The consulting contract for the international consulting firm will be allocated with a \nbudget of about $575,000. Quality-based selection procedure will be followed for selecting the \nconsultants, as the assignments entail drafting of key laws and regulations in the financial \nsector,  inadequacies  of  which  will  result  in  high  costs  for  both  the  sector  and  the  whole \neconomy. Short-listed firms will submit simplified technical proposals. All consultants will be \nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants5  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  \n \n24.  The consultants will prepare a detailed work plan before the start of services, which will  \ninclude a timetable for deliverables defined under each component of the TA. The consultants \nengaged are required to submit interim reports within the deadline specified in the work plan \nagreed upon with ADB. Interim reports will be reviewed by the SBV, the IAs, and ADB. Draft \nfinal reports will be submitted within the deadline specified in the work plans after incorporating \nfeedback from SBV, the IAs, and ADB. Study tours will be organized by the consultants to \nJapan, Singapore, or South Korea (any two) to build the capacity of the officials concerned with \ndeveloping the money and debt markets. Tripartite meetings will be held before finalizing the \ndraft final reports. The final report, incorporating comments from SBV, the IAs, and ADB during \nand after the tripartite meetings, should be submitted upon completion of service. The TA is \nexpected to be implemented over a period of 15 months. It is scheduled to commence by the \nend of March 2006 and to be completed by June 2007. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Financial Sector Development Program III and \nhereby reports the action to the Board. \n                                                           \n5  ADB. 2005.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in country \nanalysis? Yes  poverty partnership agreement? Yes \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe financial sector's contribution to poverty reduction in Viet Nam is on both the macro and individual levels. First, \nthe  financial  sector  supports  economic  growth  through  mobilizing  resources  (savings  and  other  sources  for \ninvestments, domestically and internationally). While the basic legal and institutional frameworks generally have been \nestablished in Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector, progress in actually implementing the market-based financial framework is \nstill lacking and needs further improvement. There is little financial intermediation in Vietnam today, and it occurs \nprimarily  through  bank  savings  and  lending.  In  an  effort  to  enhance  means  of  financial  intermediation,  the \nGovernment is undertaking financial and operational restructuring of the banking sector with assistance from World \nBank and the International Monetary Fund under a poverty reduction and growth facility and a poverty reduction \nsupport credit. To complement this process, ADB is assisting with its second Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL \nII), building on achievements of FSPL I and supporting the Government's effort to develop channels of financial \nintermediation that are alternatives to bank savings and lending. In implementing policy reforms under the FSPL II, \nthe Government has shown strong commitment to carry the Program forward. Second, the financial sector also \nfunctions as a channel for allocating resources to the real sector. Currently, many segments of the economy, \nincluding the private sector and especially small and medium-sized enterprises, have difficulties in accessing credit \nand other financial services. This is because of high costs, lack of regional reach, and limited understanding of \nalternative funding sources. Real sector development creates employment opportunities and enables the poor and \nvulnerable to obtain the critical means of lifting themselves out of poverty. The momentum already created needs to \ncontinue in order to help develop a diversified financial system for Viet Nam and so that the country\u2019s broad-based \neconomic growth and socioeconomic development objectives, including poverty reduction, can be achieved. It is \nnecessary to improve access to finance and make available a broader menu of financial services and tailored \nfinancial instruments backed up by appropriate market infrastructure for developing a more competitive, stable, and \nbroad-based financial system. The TA and the subsequent FSPL III in 2007 should facilitate this process.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nThe  technical  assistance  will  prepare  the  proposed  Financial  Sector  Development  Program  Loan  (FSPL)  III, \nscheduled for 2007, and assist Viet Nam to adopt measures that would lead to broader access to financial services \nand a more competitive, diversified financial sector that reduces systemic vulnerability and meets the immediate \nfunding needs of the economy. It would lead to an enhanced level of market-based financial intermediation, \nenhanced efficiency and reach of financial services and products, and strengthened key institutions and human \nresources for the financial sector. Overall, the TA and the subsequent FSPL III will lead to a more balanced and \ncompetitive financial structure, increase income and employment generating activities, reduce income fluctuation for \nindividuals and businesses, and thereby contribute to macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction. \n \nC.   Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis: Yes \n \nRoundtable discussions will be held with State Bank of Viet Nam, Ministry of Finance, State Securities Commission \nand other key stakeholders, including multilateral and bilateral organizations, to ensure participation of stakeholders \nin proposing quality action plans and recommendations. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?
