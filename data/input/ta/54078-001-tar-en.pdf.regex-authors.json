The transaction technical assistance (TA) will provide project preparation and capacity \nbuilding  support  for  the  proposed  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC) \nCorridors 1, 2, and 6 Connector Road (Kyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan) Reconstruction Project.1 The \nensuing project will require a loan of about $200 million, with KazAvtoZhol as the Borrower. The \nproject will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) transport and logistics infrastructure expanded \nto promote global integration, export competitiveness, and economic growth;2 and (ii) regional \nand  national  transport  networks  developed  to  meet  growing  social,  economic,  and  trade \nconnectivity needs.3 The project outcome is the improvement of the road network efficiency, \nsafety and sustainability, which will be achieved through two solutions: a 208 km section of the \nproject road will be reconstructed and upgraded; and the capacity of KazAvtoZhol in road safety, \nprocurement, contract management, and environmental management will be strengthened. The \nTA and project are included in the draft indicative country pipeline and monitoring report for 2022\u2013\n2024, following the request of the government to prioritize the project in February 2021.4 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Context. Kazakhstan is landlocked and bordered to the west and north by the Russian \nFederation, to the east by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and to the south by the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  economy  is  characterized  by  the \ncountry\u2019s vast land area of 2.75 million square kilometers (km), by the availability of and reliance \non natural resources, and by its geostrategic location at the crossroads of international trade \nroutes linking the markets of Europe, the Russian Federation, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand South Asia. Kazakhstan has a significant transit potential in linking these by road and rail, \nand four of the six CAREC corridors pass through its territory, with corridors 1 and 2 supporting \neast\u2013west flows, and corridors 3 and 6 providing north\u2013south connections, both by road and rail.5 \nDespite a limited population of 18.7 million inhabitants, resulting in a density of 6.8 people per \nkm\u00b2, Kazakhstan is an economic leader which accounts for 59.8% of the subregional economy. \n \n3.  Road  infrastructure.  Transport  networks  are  a  core  asset  for  the  development  of \nKazakhstan\u2019s economy, and the country\u2019s high freight intensity and poor logistic performance \nindex highlight the potential of increasing productivity, and diversifying supply chains through \nimproved  infrastructure  networks.6  The  importance  of  the  road  network  in  supporting  the \ncompetitiveness of the supply chains is growing: as evidenced by the growth of road freight, which \n \n1  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development cofinances the Kyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan project and \napproved a $240 million loan to KazAvtoZhol on 21 July 2021. Due diligence under the TA focuses on the section to \nbe financed by the Asian Development Bank. Project teams coordinate, notably on climate change, biodiversity, road \nsafety, procurement, or financial management.

Address by the President of Kazakhstan, Leader of the Nation, N. Nazarbayev: \n\u201cStrategy Kazakhstan\u20132050: New Political Course of the Established State.\u201d (14 December). Nur-Sultan. \n3  ADB. 2020. CAREC Transport Strategy 2030. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2021. Indicative Country Pipeline and Monitoring Report: Kazakhstan, 2022\u20132024 (Draft, 24 April 2021). \nManila.  \n5  CAREC includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n6  Kazakhstan\u2019s freight intensity is $0.3 of gross domestic product (GDP) per ton-km of freight transported; in \ncomparison to $4.0 of GDP per ton-km in the European Union and $4.4 of GDP per ton-km in the United States. The \nlogistics performance index for Kazakhstan stands at 2.6 (on a scale from 1 to 5), compared to 2.8 for the Russian \nFederation, 3.2 for Turkey, and 3.7 for the PRC. \n ", "2 \n \ngrew by 8.9% annually during 2010\u20132019, compared to only 3.3% for railway freight in the same \nperiod. In 2019, Kazakhstan\u2019s public road network extended over 95,600 km of public roads; \nhowever, the road density remains low at 50 km of road per 1,000 square km and 7.4 km per \n1,000 inhabitants. About 24,700 km of the public road network is classified as  republican \n(national) roads, with the remainder consisting of oblast (provincial) roads and district roads. In \n2019, 51% of republican roads and 21% of regional roads were in good or satisfactory condition. \nDespite improvements in road asset condition and project delivery mechanisms, and an average \nannual real increase of the maintenance budget of republican roads of 8.7% during 2001\u20132017, \nKazakhstan continues to require improvements in road asset management, cost recovery, and \nproject sustainability to help reduce the country\u2019s freight intensity. \n \n4.  Institutional framework. The Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development (MIID) \nis the asset owner of the republican road network, while the Committee of Roads (COR), under \nMIID, defines and implements road policies and strategies. KazAvtoZhol, a national joint stock \ncompany established in 2013 and wholly owned by MIID, is the operator of the republican road \nnetwork and is responsible for project implementation, procurement and supervision of periodic \nmaintenance and reconstruction, and operation and maintenance of toll roads. KazAvtoZhol has \nsigned sovereign-guaranteed loans for road construction and rehabilitation with multilateral and \nbilateral partners, including ADB, and is the borrower for the Kyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan project.7 \nKazDorNii is COR\u2019s design and research institute and carries out survey, design and research \nworks, and prepares technical regulations and standards for the roads sector. The National \nQuality Centre for Road Assets was established in 2019 to provide an independent entity outside \nof the contractual relationships between engineering organizations and contractors, and acts as \na center of excellence in road asset management and road safety. \n \n5.  National  strategic  directions.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  2050  Strategy  provides  a  long-term \nframework for the development of the country, and notably prioritizes the development of transport \nand logistics infrastructure to promote global integration, export competitiveness, and economic \ngrowth (footnote 2). The Nurly Zhol (\u201cbright path\u201d) program for 2020\u20132025, which MIID is tasked \nto implement, prioritizes the development of transport, industry, energy, public utility, housing, \nand social sector infrastructure; and the finance sector.8 In the transport sector, Nurly Zhol aims \nto develop domestic networks, multimodal connectivity, and private sector participation; and \npromote exports through the development of efficient transit, export and logistics infrastructure.  \n \n6.  Tolling and maintenance arrangements. As of March 2021, four roads were tolled for a \ntotal of 683 km. KazAvtoZhol signed an 11-year contract in December 2019 with an international \nconsortium to implement a comprehensive program aiming to toll about 11,000 km of the \nrepublican network by 2025. KazAvtoZhol has budget and implementation responsibilities for the \nmaintenance of toll roads. The budget for the routine maintenance of toll roads is allocated from \ntoll revenues accruing to a ring-fenced fund managed by KazAvtoZhol. All major rehabilitation \nworks financed from the state budget are awarded to contractors by KazAvtoZhol following open \nbidding. COR has budgetary responsibilities for the maintenance of non-tolled republican and \nlocal roads, and the budget is mainly funded from the general republican budget.9 The routine \nmaintenance of non-toll roads is carried out by Kazakhavtodor\u2014a limited liability partnership \nsetup by COR privatized in 2019 and in charge of maintenance works and routine repairs.  \n \n \n7  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents of the proposed ensuing project concept). \n8  Government of Kazakhstan. 2019. \"Nurly Zhol\" Infrastructure Development State Program for 2020\u20132025. Nur-\nSultan. \n9  The national welfare fund is a sovereign wealth fund and is only used in exceptional circumstances for road works. \n ", "3 \n \n7.  Private sector development. Kazakhstan has made notable progress in increasing the \nrole of the private sector in infrastructure development, including construction, maintenance, and \nasset management. The creation of the KazAvtoZhol, the privatization of Kazakhavtodor, and the \ntolling of strategic republican roads contribute to the objectives of Nurly Zhol and of ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy to increase private sector participation and strengthen sustainability.10 In \n2020, MIID also signed a 20-year concession agreement for the construction of the Big Almaty \nRing Road, a $600 million project supported by multilateral and bilateral partners. While the \ngovernment aims to transfer part of project risks and responsibilities to the private sector for \nfinancially viable projects, the need for public sector involvement remains to provide support for \ninfrastructure projects that are not financially viable, and for institutional improvements. \n \n8.  TA rationale. The government, through COR and KazAvtoZhol, has the capacity to \nprepare technical feasibility and detailed design studies, as already prepared for Kyzylorda\u2013\nZhezkazgan. However, limited resources and expertise in non-technical areas result in project \ndeficiencies  that  remain  to  be  addressed  to  deliver  a  high-quality  infrastructure  project. \nKyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan road does not have sufficient traffic levels to substantiate a public-private \npartnership transaction that would recover capital costs and leverage the expertise of the private \nsector. The TA will support due diligence of engineering designs, costs, procurement, contract \nmanagement, financial management, economic and financial viability, climate change, and social, \ngender, and environmental safeguards. The TA will also prepare assessments to support the \ntransition of project preparation and delivery modalities towards cost-recovery approaches; and \nexpand and share knowledge on tolling, road sustainability, and environment. Five areas were \nidentified  as  key  focus  points  to  improve  project  design,  institutional  arrangements,  and \ninstitutional  capacity:  (i)  financial  sustainability,  particularly  tolling,  asset  management,  and \nnetwork planning; (ii) social and environmental safeguards management, particularly biodiversity \nconservation, climate change, and disaster resilience; (iii) gender mainstreaming; (iv) road safety \nat infrastructure, institutional, and road user levels; and (v) regional cooperation and integration. \nThe TA will attract international and national expertise to strengthen the identified focus areas. \n \n9.  Value addition for ensuing project. The TA was designed to add value during project \npreparation and implementation and help ensuring strong project design, and increasing expertise \nand capacity in the sector. The TA will (i) assist KazAvtoZhol in defining a methodology to \ndetermine toll rates and assess subsidies that may be required from the government to cover \nmaintenance needs at the country level;11 (ii) contribute to improved regional connectivity along \nCAREC corridors 1, 2 and 6, with the ensuing project promoting Kazakhstan\u2019s role as a transit \nhub for improved trade and transit in the CAREC region, and strengthening trade and logistics \ninitiatives in Zhezkazgan;12 (iii) provide gender expertise for infrastructure and institutions and \nensure that the ensuing project fully benefits to women and girls; (iv) conduct environmental and \nbiodiversity studies, particularly to assess the potential impacts of road reconstruction on Saiga \nantelopes, steppe eagles, and other protected species; and (v) carry out a survey of road user\u2019s \nbehavior and attitudes towards road safety, in consultation with road user and road safety civil \nsociety organizations, which will be used to design road safety awareness campaigns. The TA \nwill support other areas of expertise, notably in procurement and contract management.  \n \n \n10 ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Kazakhstan, 2017\u20132021\u2500Promoting Economic Diversification, Inclusive \nDevelopment, and Sustainable Growth. Manila. \n11 The analysis will be carried out both at the project road level, and at the national and provincial levels. For Kyzylorda-\nZhezkazgan, toll revenues are estimated at about 235% of operations and maintenance costs, and no subsidies will \nbe required. Other national highways with lower traffic levels could required subsidies or tolling income redistribution. \n12 This complements the leading initiative to strengthen trade between Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.

To complement \nvalue addition initiatives targeting sectoral issues in Kazakhstan, the TA will strengthen regional \ndialogue and knowledge exchange in Central Asia by establishing a regional working group with \nKazakhstan and Uzbekistan.13 The first objective of the working group will be to share experience \nand prepare guidelines for biodiversity conservation of migratory species in linear infrastructure \nprojects, particularly for the Saiga antelopes, a critically endangered species on the IUCN Red \nList of Threatened Species.14 The second objective of the working group will be to review best \npractices in resource management, climate change, and disaster risk management; and prepare \nrecommendations for the afforestation along roads and at rest areas, creation of oases in desert \nand  semi-desert  regions,  and  efficient  use  of  melt  and  rainwater,  in  similar  biotopes  and \nenvironmental areas as found in Kyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan. In addition to environmental dialogue, \nthe TA will also add value by preparing knowledge documents on (i) the evaluation of regional \ntransit and trade economic benefits for road projects, and (ii) a case study of Kazakhstan\u2019s tolling \nexperience, as Kazakhstan is the regional leader for the implementation of toll roads, with \nambitious plans and state-of-the-art equipment which other countries may draw from. \n \n11.  Value  addition  for  private  sector  participation.  The  TA  will  pursue  the  strategic \nobjective of the government and ADB of increasing private sector participation, by strengthening \nthe policy dialogue on the financial sustainability of the project and of KazAvtoZhol as an entity. \nThe underlying objective of the TA is to support the transition of ADB\u2019s engagement towards non-\nsovereign transactions and high value addition projects, including the identification of potential \npublic\u2013private partnerships for financially viable road sections, and of innovative approaches such \nas regional network performance-based maintenance contracts, and concession for weighbridges \nor  intelligent  transport  systems.  In  addition  to  the  toll  rates,  maintenance  and  subsidies \nassessment (para. 9), the TA will (i) identify a project pipeline and define an engagement strategy \nfor  ADB  based  on  considerations  of  financial  viability,  cost  recovery,  project  and  contract \nstructures, private sector involvement, and financing modality and funding sources for project \npreparation and implementation; and (ii) support the definition of the strategy, rationale and scope \nfor  a  small-scale  expenditure  facility,  included  in  the  draft  indicative  country  pipeline  and \nmonitoring  report  for  2022\u20132024,  which  is  likely  to  consider  financing  regional  network \nperformance-based maintenance contracts. \n \nB.

Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).15 The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  data,  maps,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  value  of  government \ncontribution is estimated to account for 9.1% of the total cost of the technical assistance.  \n \n14.  The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA activities for an ensuing project will start only after ADB approves the project \nconcept paper on the ensuing project.  \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA, and the Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s \nCentral and West Asia Department will select, administer, and evaluate consultants under the TA. \nMIID will be the executing agency of the TA, and will mainly supervise project pipeline and \npreparation strategy discussions, for which COR will be the implementing agency. KazAvtoZhol, \nas the proposed borrower for Kyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan, will be the primary implementing agency \nof the TA, and will provide staff to support and monitor project preparation under the TA for the \nKyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan project.  \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2. \n \n15 Partner funds are sought for other projects in the road sector. The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund has notably approved a technical assistance grant of $500,000 to help conduct due diligence for \nthe proposed CAREC Corridors 3 and 6 Construction and Operation of Turkistan Oblast Highway (Saryagash \nBypass) Project, and help strengthen capacity in design-build projects.  \n ", "6 \n \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  July 2021\u2013December 2023 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Industry and Infrastructural Development \nImplementing agencies  KazAvtoZhol \nCommittee of Roads \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: single-source  Environmental Assessment  $136,000 \nselection  (5.5 person-months) \n  Individual: individual  International (12.5 person- $295,000 \nconsultant selection  months) and national expertise \n(19.0 person-months)  \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants  \n  Shopping for office and  1\u20135 contracts  $3,000 \nsurveying equipment \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be undertaken for the selection of \nconsultants following ADB\u2019s project administration instructions.  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to \ntime).  \nAsset turnover or disposal  All assets and equipment procured under the TA will be handed over \narrangement upon TA  to the executing agency after completion of TA activities. \ncompletion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.
