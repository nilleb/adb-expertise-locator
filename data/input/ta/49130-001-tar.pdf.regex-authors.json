INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since  2006,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  capacity \ndevelopment  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  to  undertake  economic  surveillance  and  financial \nvulnerability assessments (ESFVAs). For instance, the technical assistance (TA) for Supporting \nand  Enhancing  Regional  Surveillance  for  ASEAN+3  and  the  Chiang  Mai  Initiative \nMultilateralization has strengthened the economic surveillance capacity of East and Southeast \nAsian (ASEAN+3) economies with the support from the institutional setup of the ASEAN+3 \nMacroeconomic Research Office (AMRO).1 With help from the TA, emerging macroeconomic \nand financial vulnerabilities in the region were regularly monitored and analyzed by the ADB and \nAMRO. However, with new sources of vulnerabilities emerging after the global financial crisis, \neconomic surveillance capacity of most Asian countries requires further support and upgrading. \n \n2.  Similarly,  the  TA  for  Enhancing  the  Capacity  of  Selected  ASEAN+3  Countries  for \nAssessing Financial Vulnerabilities has been successful in building a vulnerability indicators and \nearly warning system (VIEWS) for ASEAN+3 economies.2 Now being used in ADB\u2019s Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) to assess the economic and financial \nsector risks and vulnerabilities of selected developing member countries (DMCs), VIEWS has \nbeen rolled out in 10 DMCs. It has also been used successfully to provide capacity-building \nactivities, workshops, and training to policy makers in the region.3  \n \n3.  This  regional  capacity  development  TA  will  build  on  the  success  of  these  two  TA \nprojects. It will also respond to (i) requests for assistance from Bhutan, Cambodia, and the \nKyrgyz Republic to raise their ESFVA capabilities; and (ii) the need to strengthen the economic \nsurveillance database and capacity for ASEAN+3 economies. Several ADB missions visited, \nconsulted, and obtained full support from government officials during the TA preparation.  \n \n4.  The TA supports two core areas of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020\u2014financial sector development \nand  regional  cooperation  and  integration\u2014which  are  substantiated  in  the  Financial  Sector \nOperational Plan and Regional Cooperation Integration Strategy.4 These strategies recognize \nthe importance of creating regional knowledge to address common risks and enhance the \ncapacity of supervisory authorities, and to contribute to greater financial stability in the region. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Asia  and  the  Pacific  face  a  number  of  macroeconomic  challenges.  First,  divergent \nmonetary policies in the European Union, Japan, and the United States6 have affected the (i) \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for Supporting and Enhancing Regional Surveillance for ASEAN+3 and the \nChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization. Manila (TA 7810-REG). ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 members of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam) plus the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n2  ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for Enhancing the Capacity of Selected ASEAN+3 Countries for Assessing \nFinancial Vulnerabilities. Manila (TA 6391-REG). \n3  Since 2006, ADB\u2019s regional economic and financial monitoring courses have been using VIEWS in biannual \ntraining. \n4  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila; ADB. 2011. Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila; ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration \nStrategy. Manila. \n5  The proposed TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 October 2015. \n6  These divergent monetary policies are characterized by the expected tightening of United States monetary policy \nand continued easing in Japan and the European Union. \n ", "2 \n \nvolume, direction, and composition of cross-border trade and financial flows in the region; and (ii) \ncapital flow volatility. Second, the international community, including the G20,7 has extensively \ndiscussed the importance of having a holistic view of global, regional, and national financial \nsystems to assess the financial stability and vulnerability of the region, in particular, and any \neconomy, in general. Third, as the market remains sensitive to the current moderation in the \neconomic growth of the People\u2019s Republic of China, deeper understanding is needed of the \nrisks inherent to capital markets, such as volatility and capital flight. \n \n6.  Presently, the economic surveillance mechanism in the region is fragmented. While \nmultilateral organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) focus on monitoring global \neconomic performance, several regional bodies with similar tasks are limited and concentrated \nmostly on East and Southeast Asia. Gaps in economic surveillance capacity are also evident in \ncountries\u2019 varying degrees of technical capacity to conduct their own surveillance functions. This \nTA hopes to bridge the gap by extending assistance to small economies, and strengthening the \nnational and regional surveillance mechanism to complement multilateral surveillance efforts. \n \n7.  The TA will use VIEWS\u2014developed by ADB in response to the Asian financial crisis\u2014as \na starting point, and will expand VIEWS\u2019 country and indicator coverage. It will upgrade VIEWS \ninto  VIEWS++,  which  will  also  be  used to  develop  quantitative  tools for  Asian  economies \nincluding customized version to suit the economic conditions of small DMCs such as Bhutan, \nCambodia, and the Kyrgyz Republic.8 VIEWS is easy to customize as it largely depends on the \nselection of leading indicators and an estimation of interactions that are correlated with the \noccurrence of economic and financial crises. The TA will also use recent lessons learned and \nknowledge obtained about channels of contagion in East and Southeast Asia to assist policy \nmakers\u2014particularly  from  their  central  banks  and  finance  ministries\u2014to  gain  a  holistic \nunderstanding of the propagation mechanisms that amplifies pro-cyclicality and vulnerabilities. \n \n8.  The direct beneficiaries of the TA include (i) ASEAN+3 economies; (ii) government staff \nin  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  whose  small  economies  have  limited \ncapabilities to develop their own financial vulnerability assessment system, and enhance their \nrisk assessment skills to manage the costs and risks of financial integration (e.g., from capital \ninflows); and (iii) Asia and the Pacific, as it will enhance the financial vulnerability assessment \nacross the region, inclusive of spillover effects, and improve communication and sharing of \nknowledge between international and regional organizations9  and national economies in the \nregion.10 \n \n9.  Presently,  target  beneficiaries\u2014ASEAN+3  economies,  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  and  the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2014are pursuing complementary efforts to raise their ESFVA capabilities. To \nsupport economic surveillance of ASEAN+3 economies, the AMRO has strengthened its staff \nand is focusing on improving its database to enhance its surveillance function. Similarly, efforts \n                                                \n7  The G20 major economies are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the European \nUnion, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russian Federation, Saudi \nArabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n8  These economies were chosen because (i) they have a very narrow economic base and receive significant but \nvolatile capital inflows from neighboring economies, (ii) they have experienced some form of economic crisis since \n2006 as a result of regional contagion, and (iii) they have very limited capacity and skills to undertake ESFVAs. \nCustomization is important as the drivers and propagation of economic and financial vulnerabilities are different \nacross economies. \n9  These include ADB, AMRO, the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Representative Office in Asia and the Pacific, \nand the IMF. \n10  While these economies attract less attention from the global community as they are not key sources of risks, they \nare recipients of shocks from global and regional financial disturbances. \n \n ", "  3 \nare under way to strengthen each target country\u2019s tools and capability to assess economic and \nfinancial vulnerabilities. In Bhutan, capacity development TA is providing support to establish an \neconomic  surveillance  unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance.11 Similarly,  the  National  Bank  of \nCambodia and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic have been exploring ways to enhance \ntheir economic surveillance tools and processes. These complementary efforts would ensure \nthe sustainability of the TA outputs after completion of the project. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be the enhanced capacity of AMRO and selected DMCs to spot, assess, \nand mitigate economic and financial sector vulnerabilities. The outcome will be the increased \nuse of economic and financial vulnerability assessment tools in AMRO and selected DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities   \n \n11.  The TA will conduct knowledge work and capacity-building activities in target countries, \nand organize regional forums to promote cross-regional sharing of lessons and experiences. \n \n12.  An  inception  workshop  will  be  held  to  present  the  latest  regional  and  global  crisis \nexperiences, discuss global\u2013regional best practices and techniques on financial vulnerability \nassessments, present the economic and financial conditions in selected target countries, assist \nin gathering knowledge that can help design a more effective regional economic surveillance \nframework for ASEAN+3 economies, and provide a framework for developing new regional \neconomic tools that can be used for regional financial vulnerability assessments. This new \nknowledge will expand the policy options for target countries and strengthen their understanding \nof financial vulnerability assessments. \n \n13.  Consultations with regional centers (i.e., Bank for International Settlements and the IMF) \nengaged in economic and financial monitoring will be organized to learn from their existing \nESFVA approaches and best practices.12 \n \n14.  The development of knowledge products will be started immediately to improve regional \neconomic  surveillance  framework  and  database  for  ASEAN+3,  and  enhance  the  region\u2019s \nfinancial vulnerability assessment tools. \n \n15.  Recognizing AMRO\u2019s role as an independent surveillance unit for regional economies, \ncollaboration with AMRO is crucial to develop a regional economic surveillance framework for \nASEAN+3, to improve its surveillance process and system, address any gaps, and incorporate \nbest  practices.  AMRO\u2019s  database  system  also  will  be  reviewed,  evaluated,  rationalized, \nintegrated, and automated to support the new economic surveillance framework. \n \n16.  New  financial  vulnerability  assessment  tools  will  be  developed for the  region  using \nVIEWS as a starting point, applying the latest techniques, and incorporating other indicators, \nsuch  as measures  of cross-border flows,  bank  balance sheet  indicators,  and  performance \n                                                \n11 ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom of  Bhutan  for  Enhancing  Development  Management  for \nSustainable and Inclusive Growth. Manila (TA 8229-BHU). \n12 These regional centers\u2014engaged in economic and financial monitoring\u2014can contribute to this project by sharing \nthe results of their work in this area and providing advice to improve the conduct of ESFVAs. Their staff will also act \nas resource persons during the regional workshops.  \n ", "4 \n \nindicators of other systematically important economies in the region (the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina,  India,  and  the Russian  Federation). This  tool  will  be  called  VIEWS++,  and  will  be \ncustomized for the use of ASEAN+3 economies, Bhutan, Cambodia, and the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n17.  To  ensure  sustainability  and  maintain  the  link  between  and  among  VIEWS++ \nstakeholders  and  users,  a  virtual  regional  economic  surveillance  network (VRESN)  will  be \ncreated online to provide data, quantitative economic tools, and resources on regional ESFVA. \nThe online network will allow discussions among its members on issues related to the tools or \nmodels being used. The VRESN will also be used as a platform for sharing the tools, knowledge \nproducts, and experiences gained from using VIEWS++. Members of the network will meet once \na year to discuss regional and national developments. ERCD will act as the host for the network \nand keep it as part of other research think tank networks that ERCD maintains. \n \n18.  Field visits to local authorities (mainly, central banks and finance ministries) in Bhutan, \nCambodia, and the Kyrgyz Republic will start after the inception workshop. ADB and local \nauthorities will (i) develop data systems and skills to account for interconnectedness among \nbanks  and  nonbank financial  institutions,  including  identification  of  systematically  important \nfinancial institutions, and analyze interactions between the financial and real sectors through an \nexamination of the relationship between macroeconomic and aggregate financial variables; \n(ii) conduct interviews with key stakeholders to complement the data analysis; and (iii) develop \nrisk scenarios for the target countries with best efforts for quantification. Subsequently, the TA \nwill help local authorities customize VIEWS++ to suit their economic and financial conditions. \n \n19.  Training for the relevant local officials will be designed and conducted using their local \nauthorities\u2019 own resources, which will cover financial vulnerability assessment, including the \ndata collection process, identifying risks and developing scenarios under changing situations. \nThe training module will cover the theoretical and empirical framework of the ESFVA system. It \nwill be circulated to the relevant ministries to ensure that it responds to their training demand. A \nregional  dissemination  workshop  will  be  organized  to  share  post-project  experiences  and \nlessons on regional ESFVA. The TA will have three outputs. \n \n20.  Output  1:  Regional  surveillance  framework,  database,  and  tools  for  ASEAN+3 \neconomies  through  AMRO.  The TA will develop AMRO\u2019s regional economic surveillance \nframework,  indicator  and  database  system,  and  quantitative  economic  tools  (derived  from \nVIEWS++) to help strengthen its regional economic surveillance capacity. This output is a \nfollow-up to ADB\u2019s support for AMRO\u2019s institutional setup (footnote 1). \n \n21.  Output 2: Regional surveillance and financial vulnerability assessment tool for \nAsia. The TA will develop VIEWS++, a new regional surveillance and vulnerability assessment \ntool that will be better suited to the emerging economic and financial environment in Asia. This \noutput is linked to output 1, as AMRO\u2019s knowledge and experience will be used in developing \nVIEWS++. AMRO will also benefit from output 2, as quantitative tools will be derived from \nVIEWS++ for use by AMRO. To facilitate knowledge sharing, the project will (i) bring AMRO \nresource persons in some field visits, and (ii) create a VRESN to serve as an institutional \nlinkage mechanism and point of contact for all VIEWS++ users. The network will also function \nas a knowledge products repository and a knowledge dissemination platform. \n \n22.  Output  3: Improved  economic  surveillance  capacity  and  financial  vulnerability \nassessment skills in Bhutan, Cambodia, and the Kyrgyz Republic. The TA will develop \ncustomized versions of VIEWS++ for use in Bhutan, Cambodia, and the Kyrgyz Republic, taking \ninto account the unique economic and financial structures of these target countries. Output 3 is \n \n ", "  5 \nalso  related  to  output  1  as  VIEWS++  customization  for  small  countries  could  generate \nknowledge that may be useful for AMRO, such as deeper understanding of the nature of risks \nand vulnerabilities for small economies.13 \n \n23.  A key risk is that changing priorities and staff turnover in partner agencies could delay \nthe delivery of the TA. Limited data and/or poor data quality could reduce the effectiveness of \nregional vulnerability assessment tools developed under the TA as well. Geopolitical risks could \nalso overshadow the importance of financial vulnerability assessment exercises. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment  Climate  Facilitation  Fund 14  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  ADB will be the executing agency for this TA and the implementing agency for output 2. \nADB will work with AMRO to implement output 1, and with the Ministry of Finance in Bhutan, the \nNational Bank of Cambodia, and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic to implement output \n3. ERCD\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Division will act as the TA supervising unit. \nThe  division  will  coordinate  closely  with  ADB  operational  units  (regional  departments  and \nresident mission offices) and other involved entities like AMRO to ensure the benefits are \nmaximized. The project will be implemented from February 2016 to January 2018. \n \n26.  The TA will require 27 person-months of international consulting services, 118 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services,  and  120  days  of  resource  persons\u2019  participation. \nConsultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  hired  individually  by  ADB  in  accordance  with \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  all \ndisbursements will be done in accordance with Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The scope of work and outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  To  implement  the  TA  successfully,  a  team  from  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Division will manage consultants and consolidate their output. \n \n27.  ADB will conduct workshops, local training events, seminars, and conferences, with ADB \nstaff participating as resource persons in some of the workshops. All disbursements under the \nTA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n28.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  Enhancing  Regional  Capacity  for  Economic \nSurveillance and Financial Vulnerability Assessment, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.\n                                                \n13 AMRO covers small economies such as the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Similar to \nBhutan and the Kyrgyz Republic, these economies rely on a few sectors, have underdeveloped financial markets, \nand receive massive and volatile cross-border capital flows. Officials from finance ministries and central banks of \nselected DMCs will also be trained to use VIEWS++. \n14 Established by the Government of Japan.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nEnhanced capacity of AMRO and selected DMCs to spot, assess, and mitigate economic and financial \nsector vulnerabilities (reports from AMRO and selected DMCs)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \n       \nIncreased use of  a.
