The  Pacific  Strategy  for  the  New  Millennium  2000\u201320041  focuses  on  five  strategic \nobjectives: (i) sound economic management, good governance, and public sector reform; (ii) \nprivate sector development; (iii) improvement of women's welfare in the social, economic, and \npolitical spheres; (iv) support for sustainable environment management; and (v) support for \npoverty reduction as a unifying theme. The strategy emphasizes the importance of economic \ndevelopment  being  participatory  and  inclusive,  particularly  if  the  benefits  of  economic \ndevelopment  are  to  be  shared  more  equitably  than  in  the  past  and  suggests  that  wider \ninvolvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  and  stronger  ownership  of  the \ndevelopment  strategies  and  reform  agenda  by  the  governments  of  the  Pacific  developing \nmember countries (PDMC) become a priority. \n \n2.  Preliminary findings of the country governance assessments (CGA), conducted in six of \nthe PDMCs2, indicate that few mechanisms are in place to encourage the participation of civil \nsociety, particularly social NGOs, in the resource allocation process through the annual budget \nformulation. In several PDMCs, members of civil society are consulted for the development of \noverall strategic directions. For instance, in Fiji Islands, development strategies are devised \nthrough convening a national summit, or in Samoa, the Strategy for the Development of Samoa \n2002\u20132004 Opportunities for All was developed after extensive consultations with stakeholders. \nHowever,  the  involvement  of  civil  society  in  prioritizing  specific  resource  allocation  needs, \nparticularly the needs of the poor, remains limited.  \n \n3.  The CGA findings also suggest that the current perception of the NGO\u2013government \nrelationship is not one of constructive engagement, particularly when it comes to confronting the \navailability and distribution of often scarce and diminishing financial resources. Experience from \nother countries as well as from an ongoing technical assistance (TA) on Youth and Gender \nSensitive  Public  Expenditure  Management  in  the  Pacific  has  shown  that  the  lack  of  civil \nsociety\u2019s  capacity  to  understand  the  budget process  severely  limits  their  ability  to  engage \nconstructively in the resource prioritization and allocation process3. These findings were also \nconfirmed  during  a  regional  governance  workshop  held  in  Fiji  Islands,  29\u201331  July  2003. \nWorkshop participants from governments, NGOs, and development partners underscored the \nimportance of a participatory approach to the budget process and expressed strong interest in \nparticipating in training as they recognize their lack of capacity in this area. The current TA aims \nto raise awareness and understanding of the budget process of civil society organizations and \nof government officials from ministries and departments involved in the resource allocation \nprocess of the benefits of a participatory approach. The TA intends to encourage stakeholders \nto engage together in the debate, analysis, prioritization, and monitoring decisions about public \nexpenditures and investments. The TA\u2019s goals, purpose, and scope are summarized in the TA \nframework (Appendix 1)4. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2000.

Access to basic social services, the quality of services, and employment creation have \nbeen cited as priorities in the participatory poverty assessments carried out in several PDMCs5. \nIn many PDMCs, basic social services often fail to reach the poorer strata of society, the outer \nislands, rural areas, or urban squatter settlements. While most PDMC governments express a \ncommitment to addressing the disparities in service delivery, there is a gap between policy \nstatements  and  the  way  the  government  raises  and  spends  its  resources,  and  between \nconsultation  processes  at  the  national  level  and  the  actual  allocation  of  resources  at  the \ncommunity level. \n \n5.  Given the diverse geography of the Pacific and the perceived and actual remoteness of \nthe  national  governments  from  areas  where  government  services  are  most  needed, \nstrengthening the linkages between the community level and the provincial and national levels is \na prerequisite to better targeted social service delivery. NGOs can facilitate the strengthening of \nthese linkages and ensure equitable and, in particular, gender and youth sensitive application. \nIn many PDMCs, migration to urban areas has lead to a disruption of the traditional processes \nand social networks. Civil society organizations thus play an important role in complementing \nand substituting for the traditional social networks. \n \n6.  Government budgets have a central role in the planning and control of the country's \neconomic activities and in particular for private sector development, which is necessary for \nemployment  creation.  Budgets  are  important  tools  with  profound  implications  for  poverty \nreduction  and  social  equity  issues.  Civic  engagement  can  contribute  to  government \naccountability by raising awareness and demand for transparency and for improved public \nservice delivery. It also contributes to the integration of a pro-poor perspective into budgets and \npolicies. Civil society is also aware of the needs of the most vulnerable members of society and \ncan be a force of change for budgets to become more responsive to those needs. Civil society \ncan thus effectively complement or assist in overcoming the weaknesses and failures of formal \npublic institutions. \n \n7.  The CGAs have shown that civil society is unevenly developed among the PDMCs and \nthat most NGOs are active in the social sector and community development. Civil society lacks \nthe capacity, skills, and experience to engage in a constructive dialogue with the government in \nrelation to prioritizing and allocating resources. Furthermore, civil society is often discouraged \nfrom becoming more involved in the budget process because of the very technical, abstract, and \nclosed nature of the budget process in many countries. Engaging civil society requires therefore \nthe demystification and simplification of the budget process as well as improving policy analysis \nand advocacy skills.  A better understanding of the budget process is also an important step \ntoward  building  ownership  of  budget  analysis,  advocacy,  and  monitoring  government \nperformance. \n \n \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2002.

Purpose and Output \n8.  The regional TA's main objective is to improve the responsiveness of resource allocation \ndecisions and of mechanisms of service delivery to the demands of poverty reduction by (i) \nencouraging governments to adopt a participatory approach to the budget process, and (ii) \nenhancing the awareness and capacity of NGOs in their impact on the resource allocation \nprocess. \n \n9.  The outputs of the TA include the following: \n \n(i)   The TA will develop training material appropriate to the economic, political, and \ncultural context of the PDMCs. The TA will build on the work done and the \nlessons learned, and use the extensive literature on international good practices \nin participatory budgeting. The training material will take into consideration the \ndifferent budget processes in the PDMCs. The two regional workshops will group \ntogether countries with similar budget processes. \n \n(ii)   Two regional workshops will involve demystifying the budget process, developing \nbudget literacy and debate among civil society and government officials from key \nministries  and  departments  (such  as  prime  minister's  offices,  ministries  of \nfinances, ministries of national planning, women's and youth affairs and poverty \ntask forces) of several PDMCs.  \n \n(iii)   Skills will be transferred to local institutions and NGOs through a \"train\u2013the\u2013 \ntrainer\" approach for future activities and sustainability. \n \n(iv)   Lessons learned from the regional workshops will be analyzed. \n \n(v)   An action plan will be developed to (a) encourage governments to open up the \nprocess of budget formulation and execution to civil society, particularly to social \nNGOs;  and  (b)  provide  capacity  building  to  more  stakeholders:  government \nofficials at various levels (community, provincial, island, and national) in various \nministries and departments, civil society organizations, media representatives, \nlegislators, and all PDMCs. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The training material will be developed by drawing on the extensive experience available \non participatory budgeting and training methodologies, particularly from the International Budget \nProject. The training material will consider the lessons learned from related Asian Development \nBank  projects  and  activities  of  other  agencies  (e.g.,  Commonwealth  Secretariat)  in  public \nfinancial management and participatory and gender-sensitive approaches in PDMCs6. It will also \ntake  into  consideration  the  ongoing  and  proposed  activities  relating  to  public  financial \n                                                 \n6  Participatory poverty assessments were conducted under RETA 6002 (ADB. 2001. Regional Technical Assistance \nfor Consultation Workshops for Poverty Reduction Strategies in Selected Pacific Developing Member Countries. \nManila.); RETA 6047 (ADB. 2002. Regional Technical Assistance for the Preparation of National Poverty Reduction \nStrategies in Pacific Developing Member Countries. Manila.); and TA 3667 (ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to \nPapua New Guinea for Poverty Analyses for Socio Economic Development Strategies. Manila.) ", "4  \nmanagement carried out by the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) in \ncollaboration with the University of the South Pacific (USP). The training will be designed in a \nway that is appropriate to the economic, social, and cultural conditions of the PDMCs. The \ninternational NGO selected as consultant will choose and visit two PDMCs to develop case \nstudies for the training material. \n \n11.  The main focus of the training material is to facilitate the \"demystification\" of the budget \nprocess, allowing participants to gain a firm understanding of budget analysis and advocacy \nskills. The training material will (i) contain information on budget terminology, the structure and \ncycle of a budget, the timing and sequencing of the budget process and institutional roles, and \nresponsibilities of various actors; (ii) take into account the different budget processes in the \nPDMCs; (iii) provide guidance on how to assess the impact of resource allocation decisions \nupon the poor; and (iv) contain a module for civil society groups on how to build an advocacy \nstrategy, in particular selecting priorities and the resources (human and financial) involved in \ndeveloping such a strategy. \n \n12.  The  training  on  \"demystifying\"  the  budget  process  will  target  civil  society  groups, \ngovernment officials, members of the media, and legislators. While the training under this TA \nwill  involve  primarily  members  of  NGOs  and  government  officials  from  key  ministries,  the \ntraining material will be used during follow-up activities to eventually involve a much larger and \nwidespread number of participants. The training methodology will be a \"training\u2013the\u2013trainers\" \napproach. To ensure sustainability and the expansion of the training to all levels of government, \nthe TA will also explore the possibilities of developing a webpage hosted by a regional NGO \nsuch as the Pacific Island Association of NGOs (PIANGO) or the Foundation of the Peoples of \nthe South Pacific International (FSPI), as well as other means to disseminate the training \nmaterial. \n \n13.  Two regional workshops will be held, bringing together approximately 4\u20136 participants \nfrom each of several PDMCs that will be selected as pilot test countries, such as Fiji Islands and \nthe Republic of Marshall Islands. The PDMCs participating in the TA will be selected during the \ninitial phase of the TA. Participants will represent the main NGOs, in particular women and \nyouth groups, and government officials from relevant ministries or departments. The training will \ninclude developing and testing several initial submissions based on the pilot test country case \nstudies. The training will be conducted by an international NGO with extensive experience in \ndeveloping  and  carrying  out  participatory  budgeting  training  in  cooperation  with  local  and \nregional  NGOs  and  academic  institutions.  It  will  encourage  presentations  from  various \nparticipants, ministries, or departments involved in resource allocation and NGOs in order to use \nlocal knowledge and context and to promote ownership. \n \n14.  The feedback from the workshop participants will be used as input to the design of an \naction plan and subsequent activities. The international NGO selected as consultant will be \nrequired to submit a brief inception report 2 weeks after the commencement of the TA, outlining \nthe  training  schedule  and  content.  The  international  NGO  will  also  submit  a  final  report \nsummarizing the findings, progress, and achievements during the TA. The final report will \ninclude  recommendations  on  how  to  extend  the  training  to  more  participants  and  other \ncountries. \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $250,000 equivalent and will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Governance Cooperation Fund. Detailed cost estimates are provided in \nAppendix 2. The TA funds will be administered by ADB. \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Pacific Department of ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. An international \nNGO  with  extensive  experience  in  the  resource  allocation  process  and  in  developing  and \ncarrying out training will be engaged as consultant to develop and conduct the training. The \nNGO will have links to regional organizations and NGOs and strong interest in building long-\nterm relations with local NGOs to ensure the sustainability of the initiative. The teamleader will \nbe a full-time staff of the NGO and will coordinate the training development, facilitation, and \nother project activities as well as the input of the local and regional NGOs and academic \ninstitutions. The international NGO will prepare progress reports and the final report to ADB. \nLocal NGOs in each participating PDMC will be involved in the TA implementation through \nworkshops and follow-up activities.  \n \n17.  The international NGO will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA will commence in November 2003 and is expected to be completed by June \n2004. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Governance Cooperation Fund for Civil Society Participation in Budget \nFormulation in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nImprove  Government  Asian Development  Government support \nresponsiveness of  expenditure trends  Bank (ADB) analysis of \nresource allocation  over time  Pacific developing \ndecisions and service  member countries' \ndelivery mechanisms  (PDMCs) annual budget \nto demands of  papers, to determine \npoverty reduction  changes, if any, in \n  expenditure priorities \n \nPurpose       \nEncourage  Number of  ADB survey of  Governments' continued \ngovernments to  governments that  nongovernment  political will to adopt \nadopt a participatory  open the budget  organizations (NGOs) to  reforms and open the \napproach to the  process to input from  determine number of  resource allocation \nbudget process  civil society  formal and informal  decision-making process \n    meetings between  to new ideas \n    governments and NGOs   \n    during budget   \nEnhance NGOs'  Number of  formulation  Willingness of NGOs to \nawareness of and  submissions from  enter into a constructive \ncapacity in their  NGOs in each PDMC  partnership with \nimpact on resource  governments \nallocation decisions   \n \nOutputs       \nTraining materials  Participation of local  Reports from   \ndeveloped, taking  NGO representatives  international NGO \ninto account specific  in preparing the   \nfeatures of Pacific  training materials   \ngovernance     \nenvironment and  Training material will   \ndecision-making  (i) facilitate the   \nprocess.
