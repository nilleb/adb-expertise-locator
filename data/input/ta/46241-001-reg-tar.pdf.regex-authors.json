A rapid switch to clean and efficient energy use is essential to reduce global greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions, ease the growth in fossil energy demand and upward pressure on energy \nprices, and ultimately improve energy security. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a long-\nstanding commitment to increasing investment in energy efficiency and the use of clean and \nrenewable energy in its developing member countries (DMCs) through its Strategy 20201 and its \n2009 Energy Policy.2 ADB has increasingly prioritized energy efficiency since 2007, and has \nexpanded its investments by creating clean energy investment funds, such as the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility, and by providing technical assistance (TA) through projects such \nas Supporting the Implementation of the Energy Efficiency Initiative in Developing Member \nCountries and Expanding the Implementation of the Energy Efficiency Initiative in Developing \nMember Countries.3 ADB\u2019s energy efficiency and clean energy portfolio has grown ahead of \ntarget from $668 million in 2007 to $2.36 billion in 2012.4 \n2.  Demand-side energy efficiency (DSEE) is an approach to consume less energy for the \nsame level of service at the end-use sectors, such as industrial, commercial and public sector, \nvia  improved  efficiency  of  industrial  operations  and  appliances  etc.  However,  persistent \nobstacles, from economic, financial, to institutional, still need to be addressed to encourage \nfurther growth in DSEE investment. There is a strong rationale for ADB to build on its existing \ncommitments by taking a more systematic approach to DSEE that emphasizes investment in \nstrategic,  targeted,  and  replicable  DSEE  aggregation  projects,  and  is  backed  up  by  more \nsustainable DSEE technical capacity to assist both ADB operations departments and DMC \ngovernments. The proposed TA aims to establish this systematic approach to catalyzing DSEE \nprojects.  The  TA  will  support  DSEE  project  initiatives  that  enhance  energy  security  and \nproductivity, and limit the environmental impacts and carbon emissions that contribute to global \nclimate change. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Energy use in DMCs is increasing rapidly to support the economic growth needed to \nraise the living standards of their large populations. Energy supply continues to be dominated by \nfossil fuel use, giving rise to an unsustainable energy future.6 While climate change is a global \nchallenge, the poor will suffer most from its adverse impacts. The case for action is therefore \nparticularly strong in Asia and the Pacific, which is home to more than half of the world\u2019s poor. \nWithout an order-of-magnitude increase in GHG mitigation investment, climate change impacts \nthreaten to undermine the economic gains being made across the region. \n4.  Among  the  different  mitigation  investment  options,  DSEE  measures  (for  instance, \nefficient lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning for buildings, efficient boilers, motors, \ncompressors in industrial sector) stand out as the least-cost way to acquire new energy system \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "2  \ncapacity and satisfy growing demand.7 To meet new energy demand, it is cheaper to create an \nadditional unit of available energy by recovering it from existing energy waste than to generate it \nby any means.8 This is because it is less costly to deploy energy-efficient equipment and \npractices than to build new energy generation plant and account for energy loss in conversion, \ntransmission, and distribution. DSEE also directly engages end-users of energy, and its profile \nis growing in many DMCs because of its effectiveness in enhancing energy security, addressing \nlocal power shortages, and contributing to climate change mitigation. Significant opportunities \nexist  for  economically  cost-effective  DSEE  investments,  notably  in  buildings,  industry, \nagriculture, and transport.9 \n5.  The International Energy Agency  estimates that keeping global atmospheric carbon \ndioxide  concentrations  below  450  parts  per  million  by  2030  will  require  GHG  emissions \nmitigation investment in the order of $12 trillion, of which DSEE investments must account for \nover 60%.10 This expected contribution of DSEE to mitigation efforts clearly acknowledges its \ncost competitiveness and implementation readiness compared with other greenhouse mitigation \noptions.  However,  current  investment  in  DSEE  remains  significantly  below  its  identified \neconomic  potential  because  of  a  range  of  pervasive  barriers  that  hinder  scaled-up \nimplementation. The International Energy Agency estimates that two-thirds of the economic \npotential to improve DSEE will remain untapped in the period to 2035; but if capitalized on, it \ncould  delay  the  lock-in  of  global  carbon  dioxide  emissions  permitted  under  a  2-degrees-\ncentigrade trajectory\u2014set to be reached in 2017\u2014until 2022, buying 5 extra years (footnote 10).  \n6.  Given the strong economic case that can often be made for DSEE, many DSEE projects \nand initiatives have been instigated and successfully implemented in the region. However, this \nhas not translated directly into increased investment attraction, and DSEE projects have mostly \nremained small-scale, ad hoc, and opportunistic. Persistent barriers to DSEE investment have \nnot yet been systematically removed. The following problems need to be addressed: \n(i)  Lack  of  capacity,  awareness,  and  orientation  toward  DSEE  projects. In \nmany DMCs, there is low awareness of and demand for DSEE projects. The \nprivate energy savings industry in DMCs is often poorly developed, and public \ncounterpart agencies, such as electric utilities, are oriented toward increasing \nenergy  access  and  electrification,  rather  than  increasing  efficiency  through \nenergy savings. Although DSEE potential may be recognized within the country, \nthere is often no agency with the skills, authority, and mandate to design and put \nforward  DSEE  initiatives,  or  to  negotiate  substantial  DSEE  investments  with \nagencies such as ADB or commercial banks. \n(ii)  Lack of awareness and incentive structures for financiers. Compared to \nlarge-scale energy supply infrastructure, financiers generally feel uncomfortable \nwith DSEE project risk due to the prevalence of non-collateral financing, the need \nto aggregate small loan amounts, the presence of multiple counterparties that \nrequire complex risk-sharing arrangements, the absence of guarantees, and the \ngeneral  lack  of  expertise.  The  higher  transaction  costs  associated  with \n                                                 \n7  McKinsey and Company. 2010.

While ADB is already a leader in \ninvesting in energy efficiency in Asia, and approximately 45% of its clean energy portfolio is \nclassified as energy efficiency, it mostly undertakes supply-side investments (e.g., upgrading \nelectricity transmission and distribution assets).11 The proposed TA will support ADB's goal of \nscaling-up and improving the effectiveness of its DSEE investment, and will increase the share \nof  DSEE  in  ADB\u2019s  energy  portfolio.  It  will  build  on  work  completed  under  the  Technical \nAssistance for Expanding the Implementation of the Energy Efficiency Initiative in Developing \nMember Countries12, and will increase DMC capacity to extend its outcomes further. It will also \naddress the findings of the 2011 Independent Evaluation Department report on enhancing the \neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s energy efficiency interventions. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The overall impact of the TA will be reduced GHG emissions and improved economic \nproductivity through increased adoption of and investment in DSEE in DMCs. \n9.  The expected outcome will be that, through increased institutional capacity, greater \naccess to information, and targeted TA, selected DMCs are able to facilitate increased DSEE \ninvestment and deployment, and better adopt DSEE targets, policies, and strategies into their \nnational development plans. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Key activities under the TA are as follows: \n(i)  Create enabling DMC environments for increased investment in DSEE. ADB \ncan add significant value in creating enabling national and regional strategic \nframeworks for DSEE policies, financing, and TA, as many DMC governments \nlack the capacity to do so. This output will build on existing knowledge about the \nrole  of  governments  in  successful  DSEE  implementation.  Given  resource \nlimitations, the TA has tentatively selected target DMCs, based on consultation \nwith  operations  departments  and  a  broad  overall  assessment  of  institutional \nreadiness,  existing  DSEE  commitments,  scale  of  opportunity,  and  the \nimplementation  capacity  of  the  country  and  ADB.  The  first  stage  includes \nIndonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. The TA will \nremain  flexible  to  including  other  countries  with  identified  DSEE  potential, \nincluding Cambodia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, Viet Nam, and countries in \nthe Pacific region, when new funding becomes available. Within the targeted \nDMCs, the programmatic themes identified for DSEE projects are (a) refurbishing \npublic buildings and municipal lighting (e.g., street, public lighting, traffic lights); \n(b) retrofitting high energy intensity industries (e.g., cement, iron and steel, food \nprocessing, chemicals manufacturing, and mining); and (c) upgrading metering \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "4  \nsystems for electric distribution utilities in preparation for a move toward smart \ngrids. These themes have been selected based on available opportunity (size \nand number of sites), potential replicability, and relative ease of implementation. \nBy  targeting  these  themes  and  working  with  country  stakeholders  and  ADB \nproject teams, the TA will derive flagship initiatives and policy instruments.  \n(ii)  Initiate  projects  that  can  be  replicated  to  scale-up  ADB  investment  in \nenergy efficiency. DMCs need to access practical DSEE initiatives for which \nimplementation assistance is available and that can be deployed at a sufficient \nscale to create a market for ADB investment. Under the TA, ADB will create \ntechnical  information  packages  on  how  to  implement  the  types  of  initiative \ntargeted,  and  instigate  pilot  projects  to  enable  practical  knowledge  sharing. \nPotential  DSEE  opportunities  that  operations  departments  may  consider \nincluding among their DMC energy project investments will be assessed. The TA \nwill focus strictly on DSEE outcomes rather than other aspects of efficiency (e.g., \nsupply chain efficiencies, smart communities, and urban planning). Initiatives will \nbe based on existing successful work that may be replicated, and may include (a) \nutility-sponsored DSEE resource programs, where ADB could facilitate demand-\nside management and demand response programs for utilities to lead, and for \nwhich  utilities  would  receive  financial  incentives  and/or  TA;  (b)  direct \ndevelopment  support  for  local  financial  intermediaries,  i.e.,  direct  capacity \ncreation and leverage for the role of local banks and energy services companies; \nand (c) DSEE interventions for end-users such as industry groups (e.g., through \ntechnology assistance), building owners (e.g., through incentive schemes), or \nhousehold consumers (e.g., through labeling and information).  \n(iii)  Strengthen  regional  DSEE  knowledge  networks  and  benchmarking \ninformation. An information system will underpin DSEE implementation capacity \nto support the case for DSEE investment. Data will be collected only for priority \nareas of the TA (e.g., energy supply and demand data and trends about selected \ncountries, and energy intensity data for target sectors), and will be drawn from \navailable national and global databases. Regional collaboration among DSEE \norganizations  and  practitioners  will  be  strengthened.  Knowledge  products \nemphasizing  South\u2013South  cooperation,  best-practice  reviews  from  leading \ncountries, and diagnostic reports on DSEE requirements and opportunities for \ntarget countries will be important to operations departments in their consultations \nwith DMCs and in the development of DSEE project pipelines. \n11.  The risk that DMC governments would be unwilling to formulate and implement thematic \nDSEE programs, or to sustain their DSEE commitments, will be mitigated by the fact that target \nDMCs have stated priorities on climate action and/or energy efficiency and that DSEE is widely \nheld as a first-option, least-cost productivity and greenhouse gas mitigation measure.  The TA \nitself will further raise DMC awareness and underscore DMC commitments to DSEE, through \nproposed  activities  that  link  country  stakeholder  groups  and  key  DMC  agencies  with \ninternational knowledge networks, NGOs, and other professional networks. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \n ", "  5\nFacility,13 and $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund, both administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. DMC governments will provide in-kind support. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Regional and Sustainable Development Department, in coordination with ADB\u2019s \nEnergy Community of Practice and operations departments, will serve as the TA executing and \nimplementing  agency.    The  ADB  Energy  Community  of  Practice  will  establish  an  energy \nefficiency  technical  support  team  (EETST)  with  a  small  core  of  technical  ADB  staff  and \nconsultants as the key mechanism for implementation. EETST will have three main functions:  \n(i)  Technical  support. The EETST will provide project development support to \noperations departments to enhance DSEE implementation, covering policy and \nregulation,  technology  transfer,  financing,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nOperations departments will be able to access EETST staff to support their \nactivities with DSEE components, including awareness raising, capacity building, \nand expert assistance for the design of loan packages. \n(ii)  Knowledge management. The EETST maintain a DSEE library that compiles \nan array of information related to DSEE, and monitor DSEE indicators and GHG \ninventories for DMCs (drawn mostly from existing sources).  \n(iii)  Capacity  building  and  coordination.  The  EETST  will  coordinate  regional \nworkshops and capacity-building activities that enhance DSEE implementation \ncapacity in the region. \n14.  A total of 66 person-months of international consulting services and 72 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be required, for specialized and/or country-specific expertise. \nThe international consultants will be specialists in areas of energy policy, finance, industries and \ncommercial  buildings,  information  analysis,  and  communications.    National  consultants  will \nprovide support in energy audits, technologies, and monitoring and evaluation14 All procurement \nunder the TA will be carried out in accordance with the ADB Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time). Upon TA completion, all equipment procured under the TA will be \nturned over or disposed of in accordance with ADB\u2019s project administration instruction.15 The TA \nwill be implemented over 36 months from October 2013 to September 2016.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n15.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nMulti-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and (ii) \nADB  administering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for \nthe Asia Energy Efficiency Accelerator. \n                                                 \n13 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.
