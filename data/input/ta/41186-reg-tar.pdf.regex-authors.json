In November 2007, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission attended a meeting on \nnational  health  accounts  (NHAs)  for  Pacific  island  countries  hosted  by  the  World  Health \nOrganization (WHO) in Sydney, Australia.1 The meeting, attended by representatives from \n10 Pacific island countries,2 was of great interest to ADB in the context of its Pacific Strategy3 to \nsupport improved policy formulation processes. Discussions among country participants at the \nmeeting elicited a demand for a regional technical assistance (RETA) program to support \nPacific  countries  in  the  development  and  use  of  NHAs  for  guiding  better-informed  health \nfinancing  decisions.  The  meeting  also  agreed  on  a  framework  for  the  development  and \ninstitutionalization  of  NHAs  in  the  Pacific,  for  which  the  countries  desired  support  for \nimplementation. \n \n2.  In follow-up to the above, the RETA Fact-Finding Mission4 was fielded in June 2008, \nduring which ADB participated in the WHO meeting on user-fees impact and lessons for the \nPacific in Nadi, Fiji Islands. The meeting venue was used to conduct side consultations with key \ncountry participants on the technical assistance (TA) scope and design. The Mission also \nreached an understanding with WHO, the proposed executing agency, on the objective, scope, \ncosts, financing, implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Lack of Evidence and Information Guiding Policy Decisions. Health care financing is \na complex domain and a key public finance policy issue for the Pacific. While the Pacific as a \nregion spends a relatively large share of public money on health services, there is a serious lack \nof information and analysis guiding the choice and impact of health financing policies. Often, \nhealth sector budget levels are forecasted and decisions are made without due consideration \ngiven to their efficiency in technical or allocation terms. As Pacific countries increasingly face \ncost pressures and challenges to the long-term sustainability of their health financing systems, \nthe need for evidence to support effective decision-making and review of policies is becoming \neven more imperative. Poor management of resources is among the factors driving the cost of \nhealth care. As such, the importance of NHAs5 has been increasingly recognized. The data\u2014or \n\u201cevidence\u201d\u2014provided in NHAs allows countries to (i) see the whole picture on sector-level \nhealth resource flows, and (ii) evaluate measures for efficient allocation of resources across the \nhealth system. \n \n4.  New  Challenges  and  Stresses  to  Health  System. Health financing in the Pacific \nappears  in  the  context  of  \u201chigh  spending  and  low  efficiency\u201d  trends  (as  opposed  to  \u201clow \nspending and low efficiency\u201d trends elsewhere in Asia). With a shift in disease patterns to \nchronic  diseases,  limited  public  resources,  and  volatile  external  aid,  Pacific  countries \nincreasingly face a common challenge in sustaining their health systems against rising costs of \nhealth care. The bulk of health resources are directed at curative care, which is less cost-\neffective. Governments also now have a new regulatory role to play, given increased private \n                                                 \n1  The mission was attached to Grant No. 0021-REG: HIV/AIDS Prevention and Capacity Development in the Pacific \nReview Mission (17\u201327 November 2007). \n2   Includes Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n3  ADB. 2004. Responding to the Priorities of the Poor: A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank. Manila \n4  The mission was attached to Grant No. 0097-SAM: SchoolNet and Community Access Project Inception Mission to \nSamoa (9-16 June 2008). \n5  NHAs track the comprehensive flow of funds through the health system and inform (i) how much the entire nation is \nspending on health care, (ii) what goods and services are being delivered, and (iii) who is paying for these \nservices. \n ", "2   \nsector participation in health services provision. Thus, there is a need for better management of \nhealth sector resources, and for evidence provided through tools such as NHAs, to guide more \nefficient use of public money and explore effective health financing options.  \n \n5.  Lack  of  Data  Misses  Important  Poverty  Issues.  There  is  an  astounding  lack  of \nmonitoring  and  analysis  related  to  health  financing  policies  in  the  Pacific.  High  public \nexpenditures on health (supported by external resources) and largely free health care provision \nmean that financial access and equity have tended to be good in much of the Pacific (although \nphysical access has been a problem for outer island populations). In recent years, however, a \nnumber of governments in the region have begun to explore user fee options as a means to \nadditional resource mobilization. According to WHO, out-of-pocket health spending has notably \nincreased in countries such as Fiji Islands, Samoa, and Tonga. Thus, there is a concern that the \ncurrent health financing structures in Pacific countries is increasingly moving towards highly \ninequitable methods of financing, which impedes access to health care and can deepen poverty. \nThere  are  also  large  populations  of  contract  workers  in  many  Pacific  countries  without \naffordable access to health care. Data constraints and the lack of effective expenditure tracking \nmechanisms such as NHAs mean that such poverty-related policy issues often go unnoticed.  \n \n6.  Uniqueness of Pacific Countries and Need for Contextually-Relevant Solutions. A \nkey lesson in the midterm review of the Pacific Strategy is that the design of any proposed \nintervention must be based on and driven by the Pacific context. Pacific island countries are \ndifferent from larger East Asia countries\u2014their institutional set-ups and accounting principles \nare often different, and knowledge sharing by the larger countries on NHAs is not readily \nadaptable to the Pacific setting. There is a need for Pacific countries to benefit from experience \nwithin the Pacific region, and to learn from countries with more similar needs and experiences. \nThis requires effective regional networking and promoting cross-country analysis to develop \nrelevant strategies, approaches, and framework customized to the unique Pacific setting. While \nhealth financing issues vary with country, similar skills are required to study and analyze them. \nGiven the size and scattered nature of Pacific geography, a regional approach affords the \npotential for seeking economies of scale in this regard. \n \n7.  Current  Network  Mechanisms  are  Limited  for  Pacific  Countries.  Some  Pacific \ncountries (Samoa and Tonga) are part of larger regional NHA networks (Asia Pacific NHA \nNetwork [APNHAN]). However, their experiences often do not \u201cfeed up\u201d into attempts at joint \nregional products and common frameworks. Knowledge-sharing experiences of larger East \nAsian  countries  are  not  quite  \u201cfeeding  down\u201d  to  smaller  Pacific  countries  either.  A  more \nconsolidated Pacific \u201cvoice\u201d and experience can more effectively contribute to joint regional \nproducts, and for concertedly adapting lessons from larger APNHAN member countries to apply \nto the Pacific setting. There is a need for Pacific countries to better link up with and tap the \nexperience of existing health policy research networks, while fostering subregional learning and \nknowledge sharing within the Pacific context. Such Pacific subregional networking would also \nstrengthen the knowledge base and initiatives of wider regional networks. \n \n8.  Need to Enhance Ownership. Ownership is critical and proposed solutions are unlikely \nto succeed if not owned and initiated by Pacific island communities. Often, external TA for \nPacific  countries  tends  to  be  strictly  output-oriented,  with  little  attention  to  encouraging \nownership and capacity building. Although a number of Pacific countries received initial TA from \nWHO to develop NHA first rounds, these efforts need to be furthered to ensure ownership and \nstrengthen initial capacity building.  \n \n9.  Need for an NHA Framework Suited to Pacific Setting. WHO and partner agencies \nhave developed NHA guidelines for low-income countries. However, many Pacific countries do \n ", "  3\nnot  readily  belong  to  the  \u201clow-income  countries\u201d  classification.  Thus,  there  is  a  need  for \ndevelopment of an NHA framework suited to the Pacific setting. The above-mentioned draft \nframework for the development and institutionalization of NHAs in the Pacific,6 developed with \ninputs from Pacific government representatives, needs further support for its refinement and \ndevelopment of an implementation plan.   \n \n10.  Need for Partnerships Based on Comparative Advantage. ADB\u2019s long-term strategic \nframework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)7 sets forth, as key principles, partnerships with \ninternational organizations, a regional approach, and an improved knowledge base among \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) for better decision making. In line with this, the TA is \nbased on institutional comparative advantages of ADB and WHO and serves a shared objective \nto promote effective, equitable, and sustainable health sector resource allocations. ADB\u2019s \nrelationship with ministries of finance and planning/statistical agencies also places it well to \ncomplement WHO technical strengths and better link health policy making with public financing  \ndecisions. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The desired impact of the TA is that public, private, and development partner resource \nallocations for health services are more effective among the participating Pacific countries. The \nexpected outcome of the TA is that decision makers routinely use NHAs for policy making on \nhealth sector resource allocations. The key outputs are as follows: (i) availability of total health \nresources  and  expenditure  data  among  the  participating  Pacific  countries,  (ii)  a  functional \nPacific subnetwork on NHAs that is also well linked with larger NHA regional networks, and (iii) \ndevelopment of an evidence-based approach to promote policy use of NHA data in the Pacific \ncontext. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will support the planning, development, and institutionalization of NHAs in the \nPacific  and  promote  subregional  cooperation  in  the  process.  It  incorporates  principles  of \nownership, knowledge sharing, and capacity strengthening in its design. The scope of the TA \nseeks to benefit all Pacific DMCs as a knowledge product and in lessons sharing (about 8\u201310 \nPacific countries are expected to participate in subregional NHA networks and forums). Under \ncomponent 2 (conducting NHA pilot tests), Fiji Islands, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), \nand Vanuatu were initially selected as priority countries.8 Expected outputs and lessons from \nthis TA will primarily be disseminated at country level and subregional forums, targeting NHA \npractitioners and health financing policy makers. Health networks, Pacific Open Learning Health \nNet, research and academic institutions, and other related mechanisms will also be used for \nknowledge sharing on TA outputs. The four components of broad activities supported under the \nTA are as follows. \n \n                                                 \n6  The framework set forth the draft strategy and major tasks involved in completing NHA in the Pacific countries from \nstart to finish, including resources required, planning and production needs, and identification of critical points for \ndeveloping and institutionalizing NHAs in the Pacific. \n7 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20142020. \nManila \n8 The three pilot countries were prioritized in consultation with WHO. Reasons include that (i) they represent a \ngeographic balance of the Pacific region; (ii) there is direct alignment with priorities/major issues at the country \nstrategy level; and (iii) since the first NHA estimates have already been produced in these countries, with \nassistance from WHO, initial gains need to be furthered to ensure country ownership and skills transfer. \n ", "4   \n13.  Component 1: Developing of NHA Regional Resources and Standardized Materials. \nThis component will develop NHA regional resources and standardized materials, tables, and \ntemplates adapted to the Pacific context, which countries could easily draw on and adapt for \ntheir NHA development and data use. This will include (i) refining and updating the framework \nfor development and institutionalization of NHAs in the Pacific, and major activities in the related \naction plan; (ii) developing simple and standardized materials for developing NHAs suited to the \nPacific setting (including guidelines, tables, data instruments, and work plan templates); and \n(iii) ad hoc advisory support as requested by national governments for NHA development, \ninstitutional capacity building, and internal arrangements. Outputs under this component will be \nproduced in a consultative manner through a subregional forum. \n \n14.  Component 2: Conducting NHA Pilot Tests. This component will support planning, \ndevelopment, and institutionalization of NHAs in at least three pilot countries (FSM, Fiji Islands, \nand Vanuatu) where the NHA development process was initiated and rough estimates were \nproduced with WHO technical support. The project will build on this initial groundwork and be \nimplemented  in  a  manner  that  promotes  ownership  and  skills  transfer.  This  will  include \n(i) country-level workshops at inception to create in-country awareness and demand for NHAs \n(i.e., building on initial experience of the first rounds); (ii) planning and development of NHAs \n(using standardized materials developed under component 1), including hands-on training in \ndata collection, organization, and analysis; (iii) country-level workshops to disseminate NHA \ninformation for policy use; and (iv) a subregional workshop to promote cross-country analysis of \nNHA data findings. The component will also ensure links with other survey vehicles in the \ncountry (such as demographic health surveys) for efficient data collection. \n \n15.  Component  3:  Establishing  a  Pacific  NHA  Subnetwork.  This  component  will \nestablish  a  Pacific  NHA  subnetwork  to  promote  subregional  networking  on  NHAs.  This  is \nenvisaged  to  be  a  knowledge-sharing  network  of  individuals  and  agencies  involved  in \nadvocating, implementing, or supporting NHA activities in the Pacific. Networking will cover \nsupport and information sharing in all areas of advocacy, practical implementation, and policy \nuse related to NHAs in the Pacific. This subnetwork is expected to be closely linked with \nAPNHAN, especially for support in technical areas. The scope, form, and effective mechanism \nof networking and collaboration suited to Pacific needs and circumstances will be determined. \nNetwork activities will include support for APNHAN members to participate as resource persons \nin relevant Pacific forums, as well as for active Pacific participation at larger regional workshops \nand conferences. Development of a Pacific-specific module on NHAs, which would likely be \ndisseminated through the Pacific Open Learning Health Net and/or Fiji School of Medicine, will \nalso be supported under this component. \n \n16.  Component 4: Research and Capacity Building on NHA Data for Policy Use and \nAdvocacy. This component will commission a study on how policy makers have used NHAs, \nand the various factors that determine the extent to which NHAs have or will affect the policy \nprocess in the Pacific. The study will, for example, explore if improved availability of health \nexpenditure data has contributed to evidence-based policy making in Samoa and Tonga, the \ntwo Pacific countries that routinely produce NHAs. It will also gather lessons from the initial \nexperiences of Fiji Islands, FSM, and Vanuatu (which have completed first rounds) and other \nAsian countries. The report will recommend advocacy strategies to promote and build capacity \nin NHAs for policy use in the Pacific (e.g., policy briefing kits on \u201ckey facts\u201d, incorporation of \nNHAs into Pacific Islands Forum regional strategy, etc.). Findings from this study will be shared \nthrough a regional workshop on using NHAs for policy advocacy and creating political demand \nfor them. Collaboration with the World Bank (which is supporting NHAs as part of health sector \nreform in Samoa and Tonga) will be sought under this component.  \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $1.1 million. ADB will provide \n$1.0 million, financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government \nof Japan. The TA funds will be disbursed based on ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2008, as amended from time to time). WHO will provide the balance of $0.1 million \nequivalent  in  kind,  including  project  management  and  coordination,  technical  advice  and \nresources, office space and administrative support to consultants, and organization of workshop \nand capacity building activities. Further cofinancing from other development partners may be \nsought  at  a  later  stage  to  support  additional  NHA  pilot  countries  and  TA  complementary \nactivities. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO-WPRO) will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA. All TA activities and workshops will be implemented though the WPRO \nHealth Systems Development Division under the guidance and direction of the director. The TA \nwill fund a TA project coordinator (national, 11 person-months) who will be based in the WPRO \noffice.  Under  the  general  supervision  of  the  WPRO  Health  Systems  Development  division \ndirector, the TA project coordinator will have responsibility for day-to-day coordination and \nmanagement of TA activities and for ensuring timely delivery of outputs. The budget provides for \npurchase of computer equipment for the TA team. The equipment will be procured by the TA-\nfunded project coordinator, with prior approval from ADB\u2019s Pacific Department, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  ADB  financing  will  support  a  total  of  25  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices and 15 person-months of national consulting for the TA. All consultants will be recruited \nby ADB, in close consultation with WHO-WPRO, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA project coordinator (national, \n11 person-months)  will  be  based  in  Manila  and  recruited  as  an  individual.  The  remaining \nconsulting services requirements (25 person-months international and 4 person-months national) \nwill  be  sourced  through  a  firm  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  (with \nsimplified technical proposal) in the following categories: (i) six health economists (16 person-\nmonths  international  and  2  person-months  national);  (ii)  health  policy  research  specialist \n(2 person-months international and 2 person-months national); (iii) health network specialist (4 \nperson-months  international);  and  (iv)  3  person-months  of  unallocated  international \nconsultancies for ad hoc advisory services are included in the package. WHO-WPRO will \nprovide \u201cteam leadership\u201d to the consultants and will be responsible for their coordination and \nsupervision  as  well  as  in  facilitating  liaison  with  national  agencies.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference of consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months starting in January 2009. An agreement \nbetween WHO and ADB will follow the approval of the TA. Letters of no-objection will be \nobtained from the selected pilot countries under the RETA prior to commencing activities in \neach  country.  If  additional  cofinancing  is  sought  at  a  later  stage  of  the  project,  suitable \narrangements will be worked out accordingly with the relevant agencies.  \n \nIV.
