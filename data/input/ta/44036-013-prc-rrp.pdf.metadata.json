I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Anhui Chao Lake Environmental Rehabilitation \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the Anhui provincial government (APG) to implement the Master \nPlan for Integrated Water Environmental Management in the Chao Lake Basin (2008\u20132020).2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Chao Lake is the fifth largest freshwater lake in the PRC. Its catchment covers about \n10% of the total area of Anhui province. The lake is important to industrial and agricultural water \nsupply,  water  transport,  tourism,  and  recreation  in  Anhui  province.  Since  1990,  the  water \nenvironment of Chao Lake has been deteriorating because of the adverse environmental effects \nof rapid economic growth and urban development. During 2000\u20132009, the urban population in \nthe catchment increased by 30% and gross domestic product increased by 500%. \n \n4.  In 1996, Chao Lake was identified as one of the top three priority lakes in the PRC for \nenvironmental rehabilitation due to its poor water quality. Since then, the provincial and local \ngovernments concerned, supported by the national government and ADB, have provided large \ninvestments  to  control  municipal  and  industrial  pollution  in  the  lake  catchment.3 These \ninvestments have reduced industrial and municipal wastewater to a certain extent, but they have \nnot addressed all dimensions of the water quality problems in the lake. Chao Lake continues to \nreceive excessive amounts of organic matters, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Particularly during \nsummer, elevated levels of pollutants and high temperatures result in algal blooms, depletion of \noxygen, and the emission of offensive odors. \n \n5.  The present average water quality in the lake is class IV under the PRC\u2019s national \nenvironmental water quality standard, and 50% of water monitoring points in the lake are still \nclass V. This represents a slight improvement over the situation in 2005 when overall water \nquality in the lake was class V+, but is still far from the government\u2019s long-term objective for the \nlake of class III.4 \n \n6.  As a result of past investments and regulatory efforts, industrial pollution control in the \nlake catchment has improved. The two main pollution sources yet to be fully controlled are \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010.

Manila  (TA  7701-PRC,  $900,000,  approved  on  10 \nDecember). \n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 1996.

Class V water is suitable only for agricultural water supply and general landscaping \nuse. Class V+ water is unsuitable for any use (PRC Environmental Water Quality Standard GB3838-2002). ", "2 \nmunicipal point sources5 and nonpoint source emissions.6 The Anhui Environmental Protection \nDepartment  estimates  that  municipal  sources  account  for  about  50%  of  existing  organic \nemissions into the lake, 57% of emissions of nitrogen, and 54% of phosphorous. Rural nonpoint \nsource emissions are estimated to account for 42% of organic emissions, 38% of nitrogen, and \n42% of phosphorous.7   \n \n7.  Strategic  planning  and  institutional  reform.  The  APG  understands  that  a \ncomprehensive approach is required to solve water quality problems in Chao Lake. Such an \napproach requires not only continuous investments to control pollution sources but also the \nadoption of a strategic planning framework. To support a comprehensive approach, the APG \nhas formulated the Chao Lake Environmental Rehabilitation Master Plan (2008\u20132020). The \nmaster plan suggests the need for about CNY50 billion of investments to develop a wide range \nof  structural  and  nonstructural  measures.  These  measures  include  (i)  a  strengthened \ninstitutional mechanism, (ii) expanded and upgraded municipal wastewater treatment plants \n(WWTPs),  (iii)  extension  of  sewerage  networks,  (iv)  a  continuous  industrial  wastewater \ntreatment control program, (v) comprehensive rural nonpoint source pollution control, (vi) control \nof other nonpoint source pollution sources through in-stream measures, (vii) water conservation, \n(viii) strengthened regulatory supervision, (ix) applied research, and (x) public education. \n \n8.  After the master plan was issued, the APG took the following two important steps to \nstrengthen institutional arrangements in managing the lake basin environment: (i) reorganizing \nlocal governments in the lake catchment so that the management responsibilities for the entire \nsurface area, the lake foreshores, and most of the upper catchment area were transferred to a \nsingle  local  government  authority\u2014the  Hefei  municipality;  and  (ii)  creating  the  Chao  Lake \nManagement Authority (CLMA), a new subprovincial agency, to provide unified administration of \ngeneral affairs relating to the management of Chao Lake. In August 2011, the State Council \nordered the establishment of the CLMA to manage all of the lake\u2019s water-related matters, \nincluding land use planning, water quality and quantity issues, fisheries, navigation, and tourism. \nThe CLMA could be the first lake or river management agency in the PRC that has a sufficiently \ncomprehensive management purview and the first to deal with all aspects of the water cycle.8 \n   \n9.  Lessons. Sustainable management of a lake basin is widely recognized as difficult. An \ninternational study on 28 lakes across the world, financed by the Global Environmental Facility, \nidentified  measures  that  would  lead  to  effective  lake  basin  management:  (i)  adequate \ninstitutions, (ii) right policy framework, (iii) meaningful stakeholder participation, (iv) relevant \ntechnical strategies, (v) adequate monitoring data, and (vi) adequate financing.9 ADB\u2019s own \nanalytical work supports a similar conclusion.10 Although all of these six measures have been \napplied in managing the Chao Lake basin, their implementation has not been comprehensive or \n                                                \n5  Municipal point sources are mainly liquid waste emissions from urban areas not yet serviced by sewerage systems, \nand inadequately treated emissions from existing municipal wastewater treatment plants which were not designed \nto remove nutrients. \n6  Nonpoint source emissions are a result of discharges of domestic waste from unsewered rural households, runoff \nfrom farmers\u2019 fields, waste discharges from animal production enterprises and resuspension of polluted sediments, \nand erosion of river banks during high flow conditions. \n7  Industrial point sources account for less than 8% of organic emissions and 6% of nutrient emissions to the lake. \n8  Q.

The project supports the PRC\u2019s sustainable development agenda for establishing an \nenvironmentally friendly, resource-efficient, and harmonious society, as outlined in the PRC\u2019s \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. The project will support the master plan and the PRC\u2019s \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan for Chao Lake environmental protection, and introduce an integrated \napproach to overcoming current constraints on restoring the lake environment. The project is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC  in  supporting \nenvironmental sustainability and inclusive growth.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project impact will be improved quality of life and a sustainable aquatic ecosystem in \nChao Lake. The outcome will be improved water resources and environment in Chao Lake and \nupstream rivers. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project comprises four outputs: (i) increased municipal point source pollution control, \n(ii) enhanced nonpoint source pollution control, (iii) improved institutional capacity of the CLMA, \nand (iv) strengthened project management capacity. \n \n13.  Increased  municipal  point  source  pollution  control.  This  output  includes  (i) \nconstruction of 584 kilometers of wastewater collection network in developed urban areas that \nare currently unsewered, and interception of untreated sewer discharges that currently flow \ndirectly into the tributaries of Chao Lake; and (ii) design and construction of eight WWTPs in \nareas where collection systems will be constructed under the project.13 All WWTPs constructed \nunder the project will be of class 1A design which provides for active nutrient removal.   \n \n14.  Enhanced  nonpoint  source  pollution  control.  This  output  includes  (i)  dredging, \nembankment works, vegetated buffer zones, and enhanced habitat for biota and erosion control \nin eight upstream rivers; (ii) implementation of a solid-waste collection and management project \nin Feidong county to control drifting objects in the area; (iii) construction of artificial wetlands and \nenhanced habitats to reduce nutrient loads into the lake; and (iv) support for a pilot rural \nnonpoint source pollution control activity focusing on the control of agricultural pollution sources. \n \n15.  An eco-compensation program that stimulates nutrient recycling between animal wastes \nand crop growing through an incentive-based approach will be implemented. It will subsidize the \nproduction of organic fertilizer from animal wastes and provide incentives for farmers to replace \nchemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers. In addition, nutrient trading between point sources \nand nonpoint sources in Chao Lake will be tested.  \n \n16.  Improved institutional capacity of the Chao Lake Management Authority. This output \nwill comprise an institutional development and capacity building program for the CLMA. The \nprogram will include staff training through domestic and international educational programs, \nprocurement of equipment, and a series of studies on (i) spatial land use management of the \nChao Lake catchment based on water quality functional zoning, (ii) an early warning system for \n                                                \n11 Executive  Summary  of  Knowledge  Product:  Sustainable  Lake  Management:  Implications  for  Chao  Lake \nRehabilitation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 ADB. 2012.

In addition, through a knowledge partnership with the \nUnited  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization-International  Institute  for \nHydraulic and Environmental Engineering, ADB is engaging its staff to conduct the capacity \nbuilding for the CLMA, which will help develop the understanding and capacity of CLMA staff to \napply principles of integrated water resources management. \n \n17.  Strengthened project management capacity. This output will provide support through \nan  international  consulting  company  to  assist  the  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  on \nengineering design review, procurement, and project management and supervision. Selected \nPMO staff will receive training at the early stage of the project, including training on financial \nmanagement,  disbursement,  and  procurement  procedures;  safeguard  requirements;  and \nreporting. Consulting services will also be provided to ensure the project\u2019s sustainability through \n(i) corporatizing and strengthening wastewater services in the project areas,14 and (ii) reforming \nwastewater tariffs to ensure sustainable operations and adoption of a pro-poor approach. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n18.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $432.11  million,  including  contingencies  of  $49.57 \nmillion, financing charges of $13.99 million, and taxes and duties of $21.50 million. ADB will \nfinance taxes and duties on items financed by ADB loan.15 The investment plan is summarized \nin Table 1 and detailed in the project administration manual (PAM).16 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Price contingencies were computed at 0.5% on foreign exchange costs and 3.8% on \nlocal currency costs; includes provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a \npurchasing power parity exchange rate. \nd  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for ADB loan(s) has been computed at the \n5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.4%. Commitment charges were computed at \n0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.    \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                \n14 This includes strengthening the institutional capacity of the intended wastewater service companies, particularly for \nfinancial management, improved accountability, and increased transparency. The design of institutional capacity \ndevelopment will incorporate the best international practices for wastewater service companies. \n15 ADB decided to finance taxes and duties because these (i) are within reasonable country thresholds, (ii) apply only \nto ADB-financed expenditures, (iii) do not represent excessive share of the project investment plan, and (iv) the \nfinancing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "5 \n19.  The government has requested a loan of $250 million, or 57.86% of the total project \ncost, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,17 a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in \nthe  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n20.  The financing plan is in Table 2. Government counterpart financing amounts to $182.11 \nmillion,  or  42.14%  of  the  total  project  cost  to  cover  civil  works;  design,  monitoring,  and \nmanagement expenses; taxes and duties; and contingencies. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)    (%) \nAsian Development Bank  250.00    57.86 \nMunicipal/county governments  182.11    42.14 \n  432.11    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21.

The  APG  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the \nparticipating municipal and county governments, which in turn will make the loan proceeds \navailable to the implementing agencies. The APG will assume the foreign exchange and interest \nrate variation risks for the loan. The onlending arrangements and indicative funds flow diagram \nare provided in the PAM (footnote 16). Each onlending will be undertaken based on terms and \nconditions specified in the loan and project agreements.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The APG will be the executing agency, and will establish a project leading group (PLG) \nto  guide  overall  project  implementation  and  to  ensure  proper  coordination  across  the \nmunicipalities and agencies concerned. The PLG will be chaired by a vice-governor with heads \nof  provincial  agencies  and  municipalities  and  counties  concerned  as  members.  The  vice-\ngovernor will chair the PLG\u2019s quarterly meetings to review  project implementation, resolve \ncoordination issues, and ensure timely project completion. The APG has established and staffed \nthe project management office in the CLMA to coordinate and manage project implementation \non a day-to-day basis.   \n \n23.  The 15 subprojects under the four outputs will be implemented in two participating \nmunicipalities\u2014Hefei18 and Lu\u2019an, and in seven participating counties\u2014Changfeng, Chaohu, \nFeidong, Feixi, Hanshan, Lujiang, and Wuwei.19 A PMO has also been established in each \nmunicipality  and  county  to  coordinate  implementation  of  the  subprojects  on  behalf  of  the \nrespective  governments.  The  15  subprojects  will  be  implemented  by  13  implementing \n                                                \n17 Interest includes a maturity premium of 0.2%, which is based on the above loan terms and the government\u2019s \nchoice of repayment option and dates. \n18 The CLMA falls under the Hefei municipality. However, it receives a separate allocation under the loan. \n19 Five of these participating counties\u2014Changfeng, Chaohu, Feidong, Feixi, and Lujiang\u2014are under the jurisdiction \nof the Hefei municipality but will receive fund allocations under the loan to finance their respective subprojects. \n ", "6 \nagencies,20 which will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation.

Economic and Financial \n25.  The economic analysis of the overall project confirms that the project is economically \nviable, with an economic internal rate of return of 13.1%.22 The economic net present value at \n12% discount rate is CNY143.2 million, and the economic benefit\u2013cost ratio is 1:1. Sensitivity \ntests indicate that the overall project is sensitive to both cost increases and benefit decreases, \nwith a 7.5% increase in investment costs or a 5.4% decrease in benefits being required to \nreduce  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  to  less  than  12%.  The  financial  analysis \ndemonstrates that the final borrowers of the loan\u2014the municipal governments of Hefei and \nLu\u2019an, and the county governments of Changfeng, Chaohu, Feidong, Feixi, Hanshan, Lujiang, \nand Wuwei\u2014will be able to generate sufficient revenue to repay the loan.23 Annual debt service \nas  a  portion  of  total  revenue  in  2018  is  estimated  to  range  between  0.20%  (for  Hefei \nmunicipality) and 0.68% (for Lu\u2019an municipality). The analysis also confirms that the individual \nwastewater treatment subprojects are financially feasible, with financial internal rates of return \nranging between 2.6% and 4.0%, all well in excess of the estimated weighted average cost of \ncapital of 1.4%. Moreover, the financial feasibility of each wastewater treatment subproject \nwould hold in most adverse scenarios analyzed. The financial internal rate of return of the solid-\nwaste management subcomponent is estimated at 10.4%, also well in excess of the weighted \naverage cost of capital and robust to most adverse conditions. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  The financial management assessment of the implementing agencies shows that their \ncapacity is adequate to perform accounting and financial reporting to satisfy the needs for \nproject  implementation,  but  training  in  ADB  procedures  will  be  required  in  procurement, \ndisbursement,  project  management,  and  accounting  systems.  Issues  and  deficiencies \nassociated with the entities\u2019 financial management systems have been identified and capacity \ndevelopment measures were included to ensure that the implementing agencies are able to \nmeet  the  subprojects\u2019  accounting  and  reporting  requirements.  The  procurement  capacity \nassessment  indicates  that  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies  have \n                                                \n21 Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture and Natural Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n22 Economic Analysis (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Financial Analysis (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nestablished procurement procedures and staffing and have significant procurement experience \nbut lack specific procurement experience with foreign-funded projects, including ADB-financed \nprojects.24 The early engagement of a tendering agent will mitigate resultant risks but extensive \ntraining and support on ADB procurement policies and procedures should be provided. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the APG, the PMOs, and implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The rural poor population of the Chao Lake region is estimated at 2.2 million, with a rural \npoverty incidence of 17% using the 2011 national poverty line of CNY2,300. The estimated total \nrural poor population of the project area is 0.9 million, with a rural poverty incidence of 14%. The \nproject will create approximately 9,000 person-years of direct employment for  about 2,800 \npeople, generating an estimated CNY400 million in earnings over 5 years. About one-third of \nthe work will be skilled positions and about 40% of the unskilled work will be set aside for poor \npeople. There will be an estimated 4,180 direct jobs during the project operation phase, and this \ncould generate estimated annual earnings of CNY95 million; 75% of the positions are expected \nto be unskilled or semiskilled. The project is classified as \u2015effective gender mainstreaming.\u2016 A \ngender action plan to maximize gender design features for the project has been prepared to \nensure that (i) women benefit from labor opportunities created by the project to empower them \neconomically, especially if they are among the households affected by livelihood impacts; (ii) \nwomen  participate  in  capacity  building  measures  and  that  their  particular  requirements \nregarding training are considered so as to improve their choices and living standard; and (iii) \nwomen have access to decision-making processes affecting the project, in particular village \nenvironmental  committees.25 A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  containing \npoverty and social impacts and mitigation measures has been developed.26 A social action plan \nhas also been prepared and is included in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \n29.  By improving wastewater collection and treatment for an estimated 1.4 million people, \nthe  project  supports  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  for  environmental \nsustainability, which aims to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe \ndrinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. The project will improve the living standards of the \npeople in the project area by providing safer and more spacious public spaces along the rivers, \nand  by  creating  access  to  wastewater  treatment  in  areas  that  are  unserviced.  The  local \ngovernment price bureau will organize a hearing prior to any increase on the tariff for water, \nwastewater,  or  solid  waste  to  discuss  the  amount  of  the  increase  acceptable  to  poor \nhouseholds. Local governments will establish a differential price mechanism for urban and rural \nareas so the poor are given preferential rates for wastewater and solid waste. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Environmental assessment. The project classification for environment is category A. A \nconsolidated environmental impact assessment (EIA) report and an environmental management \nplan (EMP) were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).27 The EIA is \nconsistent with the domestic environmental assessment reports approved in February 2012 by \nthe  four  municipality  environmental  protection  bureaus  in  the  project  area.  Adequate \n                                                \n24 Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nconsultations were conducted with affected persons and stakeholders, and the EIA and EMP \nreports  have  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  The  EMP  includes  establishment  of  a \ngrievance redress mechanism, which has been discussed and agreed upon with the APG. The \nAPG, through the provincial PMO, will be responsible for overall implementation and compliance \nwith  the  EMP  mitigation  and  monitoring  plans,  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment arrangements and reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. The \nPMO will have final responsibility for implementing a grievance redress mechanism for handling \nany  disputes.  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  PMO  to  implement  the  EMP  and  ensure \ncompliance with the safeguard policy of ADB is considered adequate with institutional capacity \nstrengthening to be provided by loan implementation consultants. A capacity building program, \nwhich includes environmental monitoring, has been included in the project activities.  \n \n31.  The project is expected to generate significant environmental benefits: (i) approximately \n1,660 tons of total nitrogen and 609 tons of total phosphorus will be removed from the Chao \nLake  basin  through  dredging  and  disposal  of  2.14  million  cubic  meters  of  sediment;  (ii) \nwastewater collection and treatment will reduce pollutant loadings in the river systems each day \nby 12,796 tons of biochemical oxygen demand, 23,821 tons of chemical oxygen demand, \n15,768 tons of suspended solids, 1,331 tons of total nitrogen, 266 tons of total phosphorus, and \n1,713 tons of ammonia nitrogen; and (iii) the rehabilitated wetlands will remove an estimated 47 \ntons of total nitrogen, 12 tons of total phosphorus, 168 tons of biochemical oxygen demand, 56 \ntons of chemical oxygen demand, and 28 tons of ammonia nitrogen each year. Further, the \nthree artificial wetlands constructed under the project will provide resting, nesting, feeding, \nbreeding,  and  nursery  habitats  for  wildlife,  promoting  biodiversity  in  Chao  Lake.  Possible \nadverse environmental impacts and risks during construction and operational phases are dust, \nnoise, air, and water pollution during construction; suspended solids released from stirred up \nsediments; and odor from WWTPs. All impacts are expected to be prevented or minimized to an \nacceptable level through effective implementation of the EMP and capacity building activities. \n \n32.  Indigenous  peoples  and  involuntary  resettlement.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, the project is classified category C for indigenous peoples. The \npopulation in the project area is ethnically homogenous mainstream Han. There are no impacts \non ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples\u2019 groups in the project area. The project is classified \ncategory A for involuntary resettlement. Although the impacts of land acquisition on most of the \n3,200 affected people are minor, even after design optimization more than 50 people will be \naffected by house demolition and around 200 people will suffer significant loss of agricultural \nland which leads to loss of more than 10% of their income-generating assets. Major design \noptimizations were undertaken to improve both the efficiency of the overall project and to reduce \nresettlement and associated social disruptions. After these design optimizations, the project will \naffect 20 villages of 11 townships in nine counties, permanently acquiring 1,251 mu28 of land \n(1,202 mu or 96.1%, as cultivated land) and temporarily occupying 1,789 mu of land. An \nestimated 3,050 square meters of buildings (13 houses and other nonresidential structures) will \nbe demolished. A total of 3,168 persons in 817 households will be permanently affected by land \nacquisition and house demolition. The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is \nCNY92.2 million. Compensation will be paid to the affected people and villages. Part of the \ncompensation will be used for social insurance for the affected people, based on their choice. \n \n33.  Detailed  compensation,  mitigation,  and  training  measures  are  included  in  the  draft \nresettlement plans.29 The Anhui PMO, local PMOs, and implementing agencies are responsible \nfor preparing, reviewing, financing, implementing, monitoring, and reporting on resettlement. \nThe  Anhui  PMO  will  engage  an  agency  for  external  monitoring.  Loan  implementation \n                                                \n28 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n29 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nconsultants will develop the capacity of offices responsible for implementing the resettlement \nplans. A grievance redress mechanism has been established to provide affected people with \nsequential steps to follow in case of grievance. Affected people have been informed of the \nmeasures in the resettlement plans and grievance steps through public meetings and other \nmeans to ensure that they are aware of their entitlements and legal rights. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.
