INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) Phase III will follow on and \nbuild on the successes, lessons learned and strengths of the PSDI Phases I and II.12 These \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects support the Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014 and Strategy 2020 \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and leverage ADB\u2019s strategic focus on private sector \ndevelopment, with the objective of improving the business environment in Pacific developing \nmember countries (DMCs).3 The first two phases of the PSDI focused on three core areas: (i) \nbusiness law reform, (ii) improving access to financial services, and (iii) state-owned enterprise \n(SOE)  and  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  reforms.  The  positive  outcomes  of  the  PSDI \ninitiatives in these areas have led to growing demand for assistance and an expansion of focus \ninto the areas of competition policy and the economic empowerment of women.4 The TA design \nis  based  on  extensive  consultations  with  Pacific  DMC  governments,  private  sector  and \ndevelopment partners. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  It is difficult and costly to do business in the Pacific. Firms have to deal with isolation and \nsmall market size. There are many reasons why it is costly to start and operate a business in \nthe Pacific. Business laws are outdated and unsuited to the needs of modern commerce. Laws \ngoverning contracts are confusing and difficult to enforce, and complying with regulations is \ncostly and difficult. It is also hard for successful growing businesses to obtain the financing \nnecessary to expand. The financial sector is generally not well developed, and access to and \nknowledge about financial services and their use by customers is typically limited. Informal \nsectors are large and productivity is low. While foreign investors should be a source of capital \nand knowledge, many countries make it hard for them to start new businesses. Inefficient SOEs \ndominate infrastructure service delivery, resulting in unreliable and costly utilities and transport \nservices, which add to the high cost of doing business. Public sector investment achieves rates \nof return that are either low or negative. Many Pacific DMCs have competition frameworks that \nare  not  strong  enough  to  regulate  monopolies,  provide  poor  consumer  protection.  These \nconstraints reduce private sector growth.  \n \n3.  Women\u2019s economic empowerment and economic development are closely interrelated. \nLimited economic opportunities for women result in higher opportunity cost in terms of foregone \ngrowth and poverty alleviation. Many barriers to women\u2019s economic empowerment are systemic, \nbeing rooted in outdated laws or exclusionary economic and cultural practices.  \n \n4.  All of the above factors reduce returns on investment, limiting flows of capital and \ntechnology  into  Pacific  island  economies,  and  restricting  growth  opportunities  that  could \nadvance inclusive economic development, which reduces poverty. \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework \nof the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n4  The recently released AusAID Private Sector Development Strategy supports this focus. On a regional level, the \nPacific Islands Forum Economic Ministers have made promoting private sector development\u2014including improving \naccess to finance, SOE reform, and economic empowerment of women\u2014a regional priority. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 May 2013. \n ", "2  \n5.  The reforms initiated under the PSDI I and II have strengthened the foundation for \nprivate sector development in the Pacific. The analytical work under the PSDI I and II identifies \nconstraints to private entrepreneurship and investment as well as the constraints to women \nentering the formal sectors of Pacific DMCs. The findings of the analytical work have facilitated \npolicy dialogue with Pacific DMC governments and private sectors on the direction and options \nfor implementing policy changes. Indeed, the analytical support through the PSDI I and II has \nstrongly complemented ADB\u2019s policy-based financing operations, and there are new requests \nfor assistance with private sector reforms in many Pacific DMCs. \n \n6.  PSDI  I  and  II  work  to-date  has  led  to  concrete  outcomes.  For  example,  secured \ntransactions reform recognizes the challenges in many Pacific DMCs of using communal land \nas collateral, and assists countries to adopt alternative mechanisms to secure a loan with \nmoveable properties. This has contributed regionally to more than 10,000 new loans issued by \nthe banking sector. Another example is the establishment of an online company registry in the \nSolomon Islands which has helped to more than double yearly new company registrations. Also \nin the Solomon Islands, the PSDI has successfully supported the privatization of Sasape Marina. \n\u201cPSDI owes its success to the flexibility of its operating model, the technical expertise and \ncontinuity of key expert involvement, the emphasis placed on research and analysis, and the \ncoherence of its focus on institutions.\u201d 6 The Supplementary Appendix gives an overview of \nmajor achievements and publications under the PSDI I and II.  \n \n7.  As a driver of inclusive economic growth, a thriving private sector has become a national \npriority in many Pacific DMCs. Therefore, there is a keen interest among Pacific DMCs to \nextend analytical work to inform their national development strategies and reform activities. \nPSDI III will be instrumental in deepening and broadening critical reforms supported under PSDI \nI and II. Although many successful reforms have been initiated, there is strong demand from \nPacific DMCs to substantially increase implementation support, extend work in core areas \nwhere limited reforms have occurred, and improve the business environment to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of Pacific DMCs. There is also an urgent need to assist entrepreneurs in the \ninformal sector to formalize their businesses, opening opportunities to access formal financial \ninstitutions and to take advantage of the modernization of business laws. Geographically, this \nwill cover all 14 Pacific DMCs, where appropriate. In Pacific fragile situations, experience has \nshown  that  reforming  the  business  environment  takes  many  years  and  requires  sustained \npolitical and policy support. A key feature of PSDI I and II and the proposed PSDI III is that they \nare demand driven, can respond quickly to requests from Pacific DMCs, and provide support \nuntil the reforms are fully implemented and tangible results are achieved.   \n8.  Past  experience  highlights  the  importance  of  strengthening  synergy  among,  and \neffective coordination with, different regional programs and country operations. There is a need \nto work closely with ADB country team leaders so that the private sector components of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategies and country operations business plans can be informed by the \nPSDI analytical work and reform initiatives can be aligned with policy-based loans and grants in \nthe region. Effective coordination with other regional programs, such as the Pacific Regional \nInfrastructure  Facility  and  the  Pacific  Economic  Management  and  Pacific  Public  Financial \nManagement  Initiatives  will  be  required  and  operational  linkages  with  the  Private  Sector \nOperations Department will need to be enforced. Coordination with the work of development \npartners, most importantly the Australian and New Zealand governments, will be essential.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2013.

The expected impact of the TA will be sustained economic growth in Pacific DMCs that \nincreases  incomes.  The  expected  outcome  will  be  an  equitable  business  environment \nencouraging new business formation, and increased domestic and foreign investment in Pacific \nDMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Output 1: Businesses and households in selected Pacific developing member \ncountries  have  improved  access  to  financial  services.  The  PSDI will continue to help \ndevelop  innovative  financial  products  and  branchless  banking  models,  and  will  build  the \ncapacity of financial institutions to deliver services sustainably. It will implement reforms that \nincrease the ability of financial institutions to finance growing businesses and maintain financial \nsector stability. The TA will (i) further reform and implement secured transactions reforms and \nregistries; (ii) review and advise on policies, laws, and regulations that are barriers to financial \nsector development; (iii) strengthen financial service providers and/or central banks through \ncapacity building; and (iv) facilitate pilot testing of new financial products and delivery channels.  \n \n11.  Output  2:  Selected  business  laws  in  Pacific  developing  member  countries \npromote  inclusive  business  formation,  investment,  entrepreneurship,  and  trade. \nImproving and simplifying business laws in Pacific DMCs will result in (i) the creation of new \nbusinesses, (ii) the expansion of existing ones, and (iii) easier entry for foreign investors. Poorer \nsections of the population and women will have improved access to formal business activity. \nPriorities  for  reform  in  the  business  law  area  include  the  establishment  of  new  business \nregistries, new laws on insolvency, new trustee laws, further reforms of companies acts, and \nimprovements in foreign investment regimes. \n \n12.   Output 3: The delivery of infrastructure services will be made more efficient and \ncost-effective. In most Pacific DMCs, a substantial portion of infrastructure services is provided \nby SOEs, which generally operate inefficiently and are a significant drain on the public budget. \nThe  PSDI  will  continue  to  address  this  issue  through  the  implementation  of  SOE  reforms \ndesigned  to  improve  operating  efficiencies,  transparency,  and  accountability.  Where \nappropriate, the PSDI interventions will also facilitate the privatization of SOEs and/or the \ncontracting out of their services. These contracts may be structured as PPPs.  \n \n13.   Where new infrastructure investment is needed, the PSDI promotes private participation \nthrough PPPs involving activities covering the first three pillars of ADB\u2019s PPP Operational Plan.7 \nUnder the PSDI I and II, substantial progress has been made in all three areas\u2014in particular in \nTimor-Leste and Papua New Guinea, two countries with strong potential to develop formal PPP \nprograms. The PSDI III will support the completion of the legal and regulatory frameworks for \nPPPs  in  these  two  countries,  the  establishment  of  institutional  capacity  to  manage  PPP \nprograms, continued advocacy for PPPs throughout the Pacific, as well as the identification of \nand prefeasibility analysis for specific PPP transactions. The PSDI would not cover the PPP \ntransaction advisory costs, but would support Pacific DMCs in recruiting transaction advisors \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2012. Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020. Manila. The three pillars of the PPP \nOperational Plan include advocacy and capacity development, enabling environment, and project development. \n ", "4  \nand providing ongoing transaction monitoring support. It is anticipated that the colocation of the \nPacific Regional Infrastructure Facility and the PSDI will bring significant synergies. \n \n14.  Output 4: Selected Pacific developing member countries\u2019 governments establish a \nframework that promotes competition. The small market size of Pacific DMCs leads to a \nsmall number of providers of products and services that are often inefficient and anticompetitive. \nThe PSDI will assist selected Pacific DMCs to establish a framework that promotes competition \nand consumer protection. This includes preparing competition laws, establishing regulatory \noffices, and assisting with improving the capacity of regulators. \n \n15.   Output 5: Successful pilot initiatives promoting the economic empowerment of \nwomen are implemented in selected Pacific developing member countries. While the PSDI \nhas a gender-mainstreamed approach across the core areas, where reform initiatives have \nultimately gender benefits, the PSDI will carry out more specific gender-targeted research and \npilot initiatives that contribute to the economic empowerment of women. Based on gender-\nfocused analytical work, the PSDI will identify areas for pilot initiatives in selected Pacific DMCs \nthat will economically empower women and have a demonstration effect for replication and up-\nscaling.  Specific  activities  to  promote  the  economic  empowerment  of  women  will  include \ndiagnostic work to identify and remove constraints on women\u2019s advancement,8 implementing \npilot programs to test alternative modalities to promote opportunities for women, and utilizing the \nfindings to: (i) scale up these initiatives, and (ii) disseminate lessons learned as knowledge \nproducts. This will include providing women with better access to markets. \n \n16.  Output 6: Strategic and knowledge management services are effectively provided. \nThe  relevance  and  effectiveness  of  the  PSDI  interventions  rests  on  in-depth  analysis  of \nconstraints  to  doing  business  in  Pacific  DMCs.  As  the  program  expands,  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) will be expanded to include selected impact evaluations, and attention will be \npaid to knowledge sharing across the Pacific. The PSDI III will continue to undertake private \nsector assessments to identify and prioritize further reforms that will be incorporated into the \nPSDI III outputs, and support formalization of partnership agreements of development partners \nand ADB\u2019s country programming. Knowledge-sharing workshops will disseminate findings and \nlessons, and the M&E framework will track progress of all the PSDI III initiatives. An annual \nreview and strategic planning meeting with selected ADB staff and development partners will \nfacilitate strategic focus and work programs. Bulletins describing issues and outcomes of the \nPSDI initiatives will be published several times a year. Key lessons will be disseminated through \nprinted and social media. Regular private sector roundtables will facilitate discussions between \npublic and private sector stakeholders. Conferences will be used to disseminate findings in each \nfocus area. The PSDI core team members will continue to participate regularly in regional and \ninternational  conferences  to  discuss  findings  and  best  practices.  A  comprehensive  M&E \nframework is an integral part of the PSDI\u2014monitoring TA outputs and outcomes. The results \nare aggregated and described in the PSDI annual progress report. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $30,500,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V),  $24,000,000  by  the \nGovernment of Australia, and $4,500,000 by the Government of New Zealand, and will be \nadministered by ADB. Options to source additional cofinancing will be explored. Detailed cost \nestimates and financing plans are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n8  For example, registering a business without the signature of a male relative. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB, as the executing agency, will further strengthen the accountability and monitoring \nand evaluation mechanism of this TA. This includes a project administration unit in the Pacific \nLiaison and Coordination Office (PLCO).The project administration unit comprises ADB sector \nspecialists  and  administrative  staff  and  will  be  under  the  direct  supervision  of  the  PLCO \nRegional  Director.  The  project  administration  unit  will  undertake  (i)  project  and  program \nmanagement, (ii) financial management responsibilities, (iii) fiduciary responsibilities and (iv) \nmonitoring and evaluation of progress. The TA will be implemented over 6 years from June \n2013 to May 2019. The TA will require a total of 837 person-months of international consultants \nand  150  person-months  of  national  consultants.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). 14 full-time consultants\u201410 international (608 person-months) and four national (150 \nperson-months)\u2014will  be  hired  following  individual  consultant  selection.9 Areas  of  expertise \ninclude  (i)  private  sector  development  strategies  and  policies,  (ii)  competition  policies,  (iii) \neconomic empowerment of women, (iv) SOE reform, (v) PPPs, (vi) business law reform, (vii) \nregulatory reform, (viii) access to finance, (ix) knowledge management and communication, (x) \nM&E,  and  (xi)  flexible  results-oriented  innovative  grant  delivery.10 In-country  private  sector \ndevelopment  coordinators  (international  and/or  national  consultants)  may  be  recruited  as \nappropriate.11 Specialized  short-term  consultants  (international,  229  person-months)  will  be \nrecruited by a combination of individual consultant selection and indefinite delivery contract. 12    \n \n19.  To  ensure  compatibility  and  consistency  with  electronic  registry  platforms  and \napplications that have been designed and implemented under the PSDI I and II, consultants or \nfirms previously hired under the PSDI will not be excluded from consideration. The New Zealand \nCompanies Office, responsible for designing and implementing Infrastructure as a Service for \nbusiness registries in the Pacific, will be sole-sourced to provide additional implementation \nsupport to the infrastructure and electronic business registries. If adaptation of registries that are \nalready operational is required, ideally this will be done by the same consultant or firm. Training, \nworkshops, and conferences will be implemented through PLCO and the selected consultants. \nPLCO  will  procure  all  office  space,  equipment,  and  materials  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB staff may be used as \nresource persons, in which case their travel costs would be charged to the TA. TA proceeds will \nbe  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Detailed financial management arrangements will be established in \nconsultation with relevant and concerned ADB. A yearly external financial audit of the project \nfinancial statements will be carried out by an independent auditor.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $30,500,000 to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Governments of Australia ($24,000,000) and New Zealand ($4,500,000); and (ii) \nADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for the \nPacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase III. \n                                                 \n9  Taken the findings and recommendations of the independent evaluation of PSDI II, which are supported by \ncofinancing partners, into account (para. 7), all consultants previously engaged under PSDI I and II will be eligible \nto apply for assignments under PSDI III. \n10  As part of output 1, small grants will be provided to selected financial institutions to pilot test innovations to increase \noutreach.  \n11 The placement will be coordinated with ADB Pacific field offices.  \n12 Analytical research linkages with universities will be considered where appropriate. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets   \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and   \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact  By 2022:    Assumptions \nSustained economic  An increase in per capita  National accounts and  Political stability in Pacific DMCs  \ngrowth in Pacific  GDP of 8% in at least four  central bank bulletins   \nDMCs equitably  Pacific DMCs     No major global economic \nincreases incomes    IMF staff reports  downturn \nOutcome  By May 2019:    Assumptions \nAn equitable  Improvement in at least four  IMF staff reports  Strong government commitment to \nbusiness  countries of at least    private sector- oriented reform \nenvironment  two components of the  Data based on the Doing  strategies \nencouraging new  World Bank Doing Business  Business Indicator   \nbusiness formation,  indicators   methodology collected as  Private sector responds positively \nincreased domestic    part of PSDI   to the reforms \nand foreign  Increase in investment of     \ninvestment in  10% compared with 2012 in    Risk \nPacific DMCs   six Pacific DMCs   Reform implementation slowed by \n  political factors \nOutputs  By May 2019:    Assumptions \n1.

In its first 6 years of operation, PSDI concentrated on 3 focus areas; (i) improving access \nto finance and financial services, (ii) improving the business law frameworks of Pacific DMCs, \nand (iii) strengthening SOE governance and assisting with privatizations and in establishing a \nfoundation for PPP transactions. It has achieved notable success in each of these areas. \n \nA.  Access to Finance and Financial Services \n \n2.  Secured  transactions  reforms.  One  of  PSDI\u2019s  major  achievements  in  access  to \nfinance has been the reform of secured transactions frameworks in 8 Pacific DMCS. This is the \nmost extensive program of successful reform in the world. Starting with the Federated States of \nMicronesia (FSM) in 2006,1 6 Pacific DMCs have completed their reforms,2 the most recent \nbeing Palau, which opened its electronic registry in early 2013. Papua New Guinea and Samoa \nhave also passed new laws but have not yet implemented them because the registries have not \nyet been installed.  \n \n3.  In all of these countries, PSDI provided assistance in obtaining electronic registries and \nimplementing the new framework. As a result of the new secured transactions frameworks, \nfinancial institutions in the countries where they have occurred have provided over 10,000 new \nformal sector loans.  \n \n4.  Financial  outreach  and  branchless  banking.  A  significant  obstacle  to  increasing \naccess to financial services in rural areas has been the high cost of establishing traditional \nbanking networks versus the low revenue that low-income and rural customers generate for \nfinancial institutions. A central part of PSDI\u2019s efforts to improve access to finance has and \ncontinues to be the increase in financial outreach through innovative products and delivery \nmethods. The rapid growth in mobile phone coverage in the Pacific provides an opportunity to \nextend financial services to a far broader section of the population than was possible before. \nPSDI has actively supported financial outreach through its work on branchless banking. It has \nsupported financial institutions in PNG and Timor-Leste to develop branchless banking models. \nIn PNG, Nationwide Microbank launched an innovative mobile phone\u2013linked bank account, \nMiCash, which enables customers to deposit and withdraw funds from their bank account \nthrough an agent network, without having to travel to a bank branch, and to transfer funds to \nfriends and family who also have a bank account with Nationwide Microbank. This has reduced \ntransaction costs, increased security, and greatly improved the ease of accessing financial \nservices.  \n \n5.  PSDI provided support for (i) a review of the MiCash pilot in West New Britain Province, \n(ii) the development of appropriate audit and risk management processes for MiCash, and (iii) \nthe  development  of  a  training  program  for  staff  and  agents.  In  August  2012,  Nationwide \nMicrobank won the 2012 PNG Institute of Directors Award for the most innovative company of \nthe year for its MiCash product. Over 10,000 new customers now have a MiCash account and \ncan  now  deposit  and  withdraw  funds  through  more  than  120  agents  and  branches, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

To date, 53% of subscribers reside in rural areas, 34% are female, \nand 81% are new customers to Nationwide Microbank.  \n \n6.  Increased access to bank accounts. Assistance to microfinance institutions in PNG, \nTimor-Leste and Vanuatu has resulted in a significant growth in savings accounts, particularly in \nremote areas, with women being the majority of beneficiaries \u2013 over 50,000 new savings \naccounts have been opened over the past 3 years. In addition, PSDI is assisting financial \ninstitutions improve rural outreach through the adoption of new mobile phone technology. PSDI \nalso assisted with the formation of Timor-Leste\u2019s first commercial bank.  \n \n7.  PSDI also provides assistance for legal and regulatory environment for deposit-taking \nmicrofinance institutions and branchless banking operators in Pacific DMCs in order to improve \nthe security of deposits in these institutions. \n \nB.  Business Law Reform  \n \n8.  Analytical work undertaken by PSDI revealed that business laws in the Pacific are often \noutdated, being based on commercial law imported from the United Kingdom. This is, however, \nchanging rapidly as a result of PSDI legal reforms, which are having the effect of making the \nbusiness law framework far more inclusive.  \n \n9.  Company  registries.  Assistance  provided  by  PSDI  includes  the  transformation  of \npaper-based company registries to those that are electronic and internet-based. This has the \neffect  of  broadening  access  to  legal  facilities  to  any  area  that  has  Internet  connectivity\u2014\nsomething that is expanding rapidly in many countries in the region. Business law reforms in \nSolomon  Islands  facilitated  a  new  innovative  Company  Act  and  registry,  which  enables \ncompanies to be registered in less than 2 days. As a result the number of new business \nregistrations has more than doubled (from 127 to 290) since the inception of the new electronic \nregistry in 2010. The cost of registering a company dropped from $336 to $175 and was a \nleading factor in Solomon Islands being identified as one of the top reformers in the 2012 World \nBank Doing Business Indicators.  \n \n10.  Community companies. A unique feature of the new Solomon Islands Companies Act, \nwhich will be expanded into other countries in the region, is the provision that allows for the \nformation  of  community  companies,  which  support  community-based  businesses  that  are \nintended to preserve and grow community assets into the future. The community company has \nmany advantages over cooperatives or trusts because they provide for far greater transparency \nand protection of community assets. They are a powerful instrument for promoting inclusive \ngrowth and opportunity, particularly for women\u2019s groups.  \n \nC.  State-Owned Enterprise Reform  \n \n11.  Analytical work undertaken on SOE performance in the region identified SOEs as a \nsignificant factor reducing growth and productivity. Although they control nearly one third of the \ncapital stocks in Pacific DMCs they contribute on average less than 10% of output as a result of \npolitical influence, over-staffing, poor transparency, and accountability and a lack of commercial \nfocus.  \n \n12.  PSDI\u2019s work in SOE reform and PPPs aims at placing SOEs on a more commercial, \ntransparent,  and  profitable  footing,  while  facilitating  opportunities  for  the  private  sector  to \nprovide infrastructure and related services. PSDI\u2019s work addresses the inefficiency of SOEs \n ", "Supplementary Appendix       17 \nthrough  improving  governance,  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  SOE \noperation,  and  through  the  restructuring  and/or  privatizing  of  SOEs.  Some  examples  of \nassistance include support to the Ministry of Finance in Solomon Islands to select management \nand directors of SOEs, training sessions for SOE directors in Tonga and Samoa and the \nimplementation of Community Service Obligation guidelines in a number DMCs.  \n \n13.  The ongoing SOE reform efforts are beginning to show promising results, with the total \nfiscal transfers to SOEs dropping for the first time in fiscal year 2009 in the 4 of the 6 countries \nbenchmarked. Improvement continued in 2011, the latest year for which data are available.  \n \n14.  PSDI I and II assisted Pacific DMCs with the privatization of 7 loss-making enterprises \nand  the  improvement  in  corporate  governance  and  accountability  of  many  more.  As  an \nexample, in Solomon Islands the sale of Sasape Marina to private operators, resulted in over \n150 jobs being saved and the continuation of the only significant ship repair facility in Solomon \nIslands. PSDI support to the Tonga biosecurity heat treatment facility, which was formerly \noperated by the Ministry of Agriculture resulted in Tonga fruit and vegetables being exported to \nNew Zealand, is an example of successful corporatization and commercialization.  \n \n15.  Public\u2013private partnerships. PPPs have become a central theme in reform in Pacific \nDMCs, not only in PSDI but also in ADB\u2019s Pacific Department more generally. In spite of \nsignificant inputs under PSDI, PPPs have generally been embryonic in the region and only in \n2012 were beginning to achieve momentum. Some examples include (i) in Timor-Leste, a PPP \npolicy and draft law was finalized in 2011 and endorsed by the Cabinet in early 2012; and (ii) in \nPNG, a draft PPP bill was finalized in 2011 and now awaits submission to Parliament. These \nlegal frameworks will provide the basis for preparing PPP transactions in a transparent and \npredictable manner, allowing a PPP program to develop that will reduce the risks of participation \nby the private sector.   \n \n16.  While  the  frameworks  are  being  developed,  PPP  transactions  are  being  prepared, \nincluding the operation and maintenance contracts in the water and wastewater sectors in \nTimor-Leste and Vanuatu, the power sector in Timor-Leste, and the port sector in PNG. PSDI\u2019s \nPPP assessment for PNG\u2019s Lae Port resulted in the government\u2019s commitment to operate the \nport under a PPP arrangement in the future. This work complements a large ADB investment in \nLae Port. PSDI also conducted PPP assessments of 22 potential infrastructure projects in \nTimor-Leste in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation. This resulted in 4 pre-\nfeasibility studies.  \n \nD.  Cross Cutting Themes \n \n17.  Gender.  PSDI actively considers gender issues when initiating reforms. Through its \ncomprehensive  M&E  framework,  PSDI  tracks  gender  impact  using  the  ADB  gender \nclassification framework. All of PSDI\u2019s initiatives promote gender benefits, with 45 of the 70 \ninitiatives classified as either category GEN or EGM. PSDI has collected significant anecdotal \nevidence of the substantial gender effects of the company law reform in Solomon Islands, in \nparticular from the provision of community companies. In PNG and Timor-Leste, there has been \na large increase in bank accounts opened and held by women. Before these facilities became \navailable, many women opening accounts had never been in control of their own finances. \n \n18.  Analytical work. Reform initiatives under PSDI are based on a substantial foundation of \nanalytical work. To date 6 private sector assessments have been undertaken or updated under \nPSDI I and II and are used to ensure that reforms are effective and to reestablish priorities on a \n ", "18  Supplementary Appendix \n \n \nregular basis. SOE reform is based on the benchmarking analysis of Finding Balance, which \ncompares SOE performance across the region. Analysis of the contracting environment of 4 \nPacific DMCs will form the basis for contract reform. Work on competition policies has been \nundertaken in Cook Islands, PNG, and Samoa and will provide the benchmark for competition \npolicy reform.  \n \nLIST OF ANALYTICAL WORK UNDERTAKEN UNDER  \nPRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES I AND II \n \n \nAsian Development Bank. 2012.
