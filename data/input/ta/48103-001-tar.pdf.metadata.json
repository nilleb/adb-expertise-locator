INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the \nMinistry of Education (MOE) in evaluating policies to promote graduate employment, which the \ngovernment views as an important issue.1 This policy directive recognizes the need to (i) review \nand implement graduate employment policies; (ii) expand avenues for graduate employment; (iii) \nencourage  self-employment  and  entrepreneurship;  (iv)  strengthen  employment  services, \nassistance, and support schemes; (v) promote equity; and (vi) better orient university education \nto meet socioeconomic development needs. The TA will support the MOE to address this policy \nagenda, particularly with regard to reviewing and improving graduate employment policies.2 The \nADB project team conducted consultations and reached agreement with the MOE on the TA\u2019s \nimpact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  and  financing  arrangements,  and  the  terms  of \nreference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  number  of  college  graduates  in  the  PRC  has  rapidly  increased  since  the \ngovernment\u2019s decision in 1999 to expand the tertiary education sector to stimulate the economy, \nwhich had been affected by the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998. This expansion resulted in 2 \nmillion university graduates in 2003 and almost 7 million in 2013. Meanwhile, however, the \nPRC's impressive economic growth rate has reduced, and the economy is not creating the \nvolume of jobs that are required to employ such large numbers of graduates. The labor market \nin  the  PRC  reflects  the  rapid  growth  in  manufacturing,  which  requires  mainly  lower-level \nqualifications, while the service sector and self-employment have not created the kind of diverse \nand high-skilled jobs that many university graduates desire. As a consequence, studies show \nthat many employers express their inability to find employees with relevant and appropriate \nskills, indicating a skills\u2013job mismatch.3 Further, many university graduates find themselves \nunderemployed after several months of gaining employment. The unemployment rate for recent \ncollege graduates in urban areas aged 21\u201325 is 16%, nearly four times that of blue-collar \nworkers in urban areas.4 \n \n3.  Since expansion of the tertiary education sector began in 1999, the government has \nimplemented seven key policies to promote graduate employment:  \n \n(i)   Providing employment opportunities in grassroots communities, including through \nthe College Students Volunteer to the West Program, the Three Supports and One \nAssistance  Plan  (which  focuses  on  educational  service,  agricultural  activities, \npublic health service, and poverty reduction in rural areas), and the Special Posts \nof Rural Teachers Plan. \n(ii)   Encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises and non-public enterprises to \nemploy college graduates. \n                                                \n1  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Office of the State Council. 2013. Document No. 35 on University \nGraduate Employment. Beijing. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 May 2014. \n3  L. Chen, M. Mourshed, and A. Grant. 2013. The $250 Billion Question: Can China Close the Skills Gap? (ADB \nrecognizes this member by the name the People\u2019s Republic of China). \n  http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education/china-skills-gap.pdf  \n4  This graduate unemployment rate is based on estimates using government survey data, and is widely used as the \ncurrent 6-month unemployment rate for college graduates. \n ", "2   \n(iii)  Encouraging key state-owned enterprises and research projects to recruit college \ngraduates. \n(iv)  Encouraging college graduates to start their own business. \n(v)   Improving or reforming employment services available to college graduates. \n(vi)  Enhancing employability. \n(vii)  Assisting disadvantaged college graduates in job placement. \n \n4.  Despite these policies, graduate unemployment has increased. According to research \ndata, the 2013 employment contract signing rate for postgraduates was 26% (down from 35% in \n2012), and 35% for undergraduates.5 In Shanghai, only 44% of a total 178,000 undergraduate \nand graduate students signed employment contracts in 2013.6 \n \n5.  The problem of unemployment is complex and alarming for policy makers, and it has \nserious  implications  for  the  PRC\u2019s  future  economic  agenda.  Unemployment  of  university \ngraduates is different from unemployment in the general population because it has serious \nimplications on the vast amount of public resources being invested in tertiary education that \ncould  be  more  efficiently  allocated.  University  graduate  unemployment  is  the  result  of  (i) \ninsufficient job creation due to a combination of economic imbalances, including a slowdown of \neconomic growth and structural issues with the labor market such as insufficient support for \nmicroenterprises  and  the  delayed  emergence  of  new  strategic  sectors  such  as  modern \nmanufacturing and services; and (ii) supply-side factors, including oversupply, relevance of skills, \nand  quality  aspects  such  as  types  and  levels  of  competencies  relative  to  labor  market \nrequirements. Further, female and male graduates face different experiences and issues with \nregard  to  employment,  unemployment,  and  underemployment,  which  create  an  additional \ncompelling angle for analyzing the problem of graduate unemployment. \n \n6.  Further challenges posed by rapid urbanization and economic growth have created even \nmore vulnerabilities and difficulties for migrants, minority communities, and women, who find it \neven more difficult to gain employment given their lack of networks and connections with and \naccess to information on potential employers. University graduate employment is particularly \nimportant as the PRC seeks to (i) avoid the middle-income trap through structural upgrading, \ndomestic consumption stimulation, and service sector growth with a focus on high-technology, \nknowledge-intensive industries, and the agricultural and service sectors; and (ii) better balance \nthis  economic  growth  with  social  development  and  mobility  to  reduce  social  tensions, \nparticularly among an emerging aspirational, educated, digitally connected young middle class, \nand through better service provision to under-resourced groups. \n \n7.  The dynamics of the labor markets in the PRC are diverse, with significant differences \nbetween urban and rural areas, the large traditional manufacturing sector and the burgeoning \nservices  sector,  and  the  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  and  self-employment  sectors. \nRather  than  being  a  simple  mismatch  of  supply  and  demand,  graduate  unemployment \nencompasses other impediments, including social- and gender-based barriers, youth aspiration \n                                                \n5  My China Occupational Skills (or MyCOS) was established in 2006 as a private data institution that has developed \ngraduate employment and education quality evaluation databases for colleges and universities, government \neducation bureaus, and research institutions. The resulting survey data form the foundation for the PRC\u2019s first \nnationwide college graduate employment database. My China Occupational Skills has published four annual \neditions of the widely regarded Chinese College Graduates\u2019 Employment Annual Report through the Social \nSciences Academic Press. Employment contract signing is defined as graduates gaining employment within 6 \nmonths of graduation. \n6  Shanghai Municipal Education Commission data, 2013. \n ", "  3 \nthat goes unmet, and the rapidly transforming technologies that pose challenges for the labor \nmarket and education system. \n \n8.  The TA will seek to inform policy analysis and decision making by focusing on policies to \nstrengthen  graduate  employability  and  employment,  with  an  emphasis  on  expanding  self-\nemployment opportunities, strengthening employment assistance and support schemes for the \ndisadvantaged and women, and encouraging graduates to seek employment in local urban and \nrural areas as well as in lagging central and western regions. The TA will help facilitate wider \ndialogue  between  employers,  labor  market  stakeholders,  and  policy  makers  on  issues  of \nuniversity  graduates\u2019  skills  and  their  employability.  The  TA  is  intended  to  provide \nrecommendations  to  improve  university  education  as  well  as  the  enabling  environment  to \nexpand employment, including through self-employment and small and medium-sized enterprise \ndevelopment. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  will  be  stronger  university  graduate  employment  policies  adopted.  The \noutcome will be an informed, inclusive, and comprehensive policy framework for improving \nuniversity graduate employability. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  using  a  combination  of  analytical  and  consultative, \nquantitative,  and  qualitative  approaches  in  a  phased  manner  (i.e.,  through  reports  and \nparticipatory consultative focus groups and workshops) that can be shared intermittently to \ninform policy makers of early findings for preparation of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020. The TA outputs will be (i) policy recommendations for expanding university graduate \nemployment  opportunities  and  strengthening  the  enabling  environment  for  graduate  self-\nemployment, and (ii) policy recommendations for strengthening the focus of universities on \npromoting employability and employment of graduates. Both outputs will take into consideration \ngender concerns. \n \n11.  First, the TA will contribute to the policy agenda relating to graduate employability, \nemployment, and the labor market (outside of the supply-side factors relating to universities) by \nstrengthening the interface and linkages between higher education and the world of work. The \nTA will analyze policies relating to self-employment, the rebalancing of employment in western \nand central regions, poor students attending rural and urban universities, gender concerns, and \nemployers\u2019 practices. While quantitative review will consider nationwide data, this analysis, \nparticularly case studies, will be based on selected provinces or universities. \n \n12.  Output  1  will  (i)  analyze  the  current  situation  of  graduate  unemployment  through \nquantitative, qualitative, and case study methods, including case studies of both male and \nfemale graduates; (ii) evaluate reasons for graduate unemployment, particularly in the self-\nemployment sector, to identify opportunities for policy reform, and produce a brief report to \nshare with stakeholders; (iii) review mechanisms for monitoring and tracking of unemployment \nand progression of male and female graduates in coordination with line ministries and sectors \n(e.g., Ministry of Human Resources and Social Services) and employers; and (iv) provide a \ncomprehensive set of policy recommendations to promote employment and self-employment \nrelevant to other policy-making state institutions. \n ", "4   \n13.  Moreover,  the  TA  will  assist  universities  to  develop  and  offer  stronger  support  for \nstudents to gain employment, including (i) expanded employment and employment-orientation \nservices, (ii) curricula to develop enterprise start-up skills and entrepreneurship training, (iii) \nbetter linkages with public employment service agencies as well as private employers, and (iv) \nimproved  employment  assistance  and  support  schemes  to  university  graduates  from  poor \nfamilies, those undertaking employment in poorer local urban and rural areas, and women. \n \n14.  Output  2  will  (i)  evaluate  existing  policies  (footnote  1)  relating  to  promotion  of \nemployment  of  university  graduates;  (ii)  evaluate  policies  relating  to  self-employment  and \npolicies encouraging graduates to seek employment in local urban and rural areas and in \nlagging central and western regions, and present the findings in an interim report; (iii) review \npromising  pilots  promoting  employability  and  employment  implemented  in  the  PRC  and \nsummarize representative case studies or examples in a short case study report; (iv) review \ninternational experience and best practices in university-led promotion of graduate employment; \n(v) provide a comprehensive set of policy recommendations based on evaluation and review to \nimprove university education for graduate employability and employment; and (vi) organize and \nconduct an international policy workshop on graduate employability and employment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of technical expertise, support for communications, \nlogistics, workshops, administrative costs, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing agency for the project will be the Department of Comprehensive Reform, \nMOE. A steering group comprising relevant departments of the MOE and other ministries will be \nestablished to guide the work in the TA and will remain active throughout implementation. The \nMOE will ensure, guide, and oversee the research design and implementation, and will be \nresponsible for ensuring timely completion of the interim outputs and appropriate consultations \nwith stakeholders. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2015. The TA will engage \nindividual  consultants  and  a  firm  as  national  and  international  consultants.  The  terms  of \nreference agreed with the MOE include experts in (i) higher education, who will be the team \nleader and coordinator (national, 18 person-months); (ii) research and labor market (national, 12 \nperson-months); (iii) quantitative research (national, 18 person-months); (iv) statistics (national, \n12 person-months); (v) qualitative research (national, 8 person-months); (vi) higher education \nand economics (international, 2 person-months); and (vii) labor market (international, 2 person-\nmonths). The international consultants will be engaged as individual consultants (Appendix 3). \nServices  to  support  consultations,  workshops,  and  surveys  will  also  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n18.  The consultants will be selected based on their academic qualifications and relevant \nwork  experience.  All  consultants  under  the TA  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm \nwill be selected using the consultants\u2019 qualification selection method, with a biodata technical \nproposal. This method will be used because highly specialized expertise is required for this \n ", "  5 \nassignment.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n19.  The proposed TA will have project-specific indicators and targets, indicated in the design \nand  monitoring  framework,  and  will  be  monitored  to  ensure  timely  completion  of  periodic \ndeliverables to ensure appropriate policy advice, including for the development of the Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan. A monthly progress report will be provided by the project coordinator. A panel of \nglobal experts will be engaged as individuals (for focused outputs and brief advisory guidance) \nto ensure overall quality and policy relevance of the work. Findings of the various outputs of the \nTA will be prepared as each output is completed (specific milestones will be identified and \nagreed during inception), and short policy and/or technical notes will be shared with decision \nmakers. An interim policy note will be prepared to provide input for the Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan.7 A  final  report  will  also  be  prepared  and  shared  widely  at  the  end  of  the  TA  at  a \nconference. \n \nIV.
