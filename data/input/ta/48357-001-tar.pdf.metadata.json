For  ADB,  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth  is  a  priority  under  Strategy \n2020, with operational significance for this S-CDTA as detailed in the Urban Operational Plan \n2012\u20122020.7 \n \n5.  In Melaka, the TA 8040-REG initiated GCAP with capacity building activities envisioned \nto strengthen the ability of stakeholders, especially at the local government level to implement \nand increase competencies in integrated urban development. The initial efforts, based on a \nneeds assessment, identified an investment program comprising priority investment projects for \nresilience  in  urban  services.  These  projects  emerged  from  the  thematic  areas  of  energy \nefficiency,  natural  resource  management,  green  transportation,  and  cultural  heritage  and \ntourism, among others. \n \n6.  The  GCAP  for  Melaka  was  endorsed  by  the  Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand  Growth \nTriangle (IMT-GT) Summit in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar in May 2014 and was adopted by the \nState of Melaka as the overarching document to operationalize its blueprint to guide integrated \nurban development and urban planning as a road map for green growth in Malaysia. This work \nencouraged the Government to plan a series of follow-up activities to be carried out under the \nS-CDTA, making the request during ADB missions in November 2013 and April 2014. At the \nIMT-GT second Ministerial Meeting on 13 September 2013, the IMT-GT green cities initiative \nwas selected as a key signature project, with Melaka as the pilot city. The 7th IMT-GT Summit in \nBrunei, Darussalam on 25 April 2013 further directed the immediate implementation of projects \nidentified in the initial green city report on Melaka, of which the green city benchmarking (GCB) \nand baseline indexing was prioritized by the economic planning unit for support from ADB. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Attachment 1.  \n \n7.  The S-CDTA will be financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Other \nSources) and will be reimbursed by MGTC. As the MGTC is tasked to implement green urban \ndevelopment projects and activities independently of the Government, ADB will work directly \nwith MGTC, and not through the Government in implementing the S-CDTA. It is on this basis \nthat the S-CDTA is classified as nonsovereign.8  \n \nB.  ISSUES \n8.  The proposed S-CDTA builds on the GrEEEn cities approach9 initiated under the Green \nCities RETA  to reflect a conscious effort to address emerging problems resulting from rapid \nurbanization and the broader challenges of degradation of the environment, over-exploitation of \nnatural resources, increased risks from floods and natural disasters, and reduced quality of \n                                                \n6  Government of Malaysia, Economic Planning Unit. 2010. 10th Malaysia Plan 2011\u20122015.

Malaysia is experiencing rapid growth of its urban \ncenters: the proportion of the population living in urban areas is expected to climb from the \ncurrent level of 65% to 85% in 2050.10 While these areas provide some of the key drivers of \nnational economic growth, urbanization puts pressure on the environment as well as demands \nthat local government officials have the capacity to cope with increasingly complex issues \ninvolving the provision of services and the stewardship of the urban environment.11 These \nissues  range  across  the  many facets  of  urban  life  including  the  need for  better  planning, \nreducing  urban  sprawl  and  inequities  in  service  provisions,  improving  energy  efficiency, \nenhancing water and sanitation services, improving solid waste management, addressing the \nurban heat island effect (urban centers are hotter than surrounding areas), and widening and \ndeepening mobility options. In short, the task is to improve the quality of urban life through \nbetter  policies  and  actions  with  improved  institutional  coordination  and  strengthened \ncompetencies for implementation.  \n \n9.  Melaka is well recognized as a world heritage city that receives millions of visitors \nannually. The city is expected to increase in population, adding over 120,000 residents between \n2011  and  2020.  Manufacturing  is  strong  and  was  responsible  for  approximately  45%  of \nMelaka\u2019s gross domestic product and nearly 29% of the jobs in 2011. Nearly two-thirds of \nMelaka is categorized as environmentally-sensitive areas due to ecological reasons such as rich \nbiodiversity. Agriculture is still prominent as a land use and occupies half of the land in Melaka. \nPortions of Melaka, particularly the historic part, reflect green design characteristics such as \nwalkable neighborhoods and mixed-use developments that reduce the need for auto-use. By \ntransforming the Melaka River from a drainage channel to a popular and award-winning cultural \namenity,  Melaka  has  already  demonstrated  its  leadership  in  successfully  implementing  an \nintegrated  project.  This  S-CDTA  will  prepare  Melaka  as  a  good  practice  example  with \nopportunity for  replication  not  only  nationally  but  across the IMT-GT  and  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion countries.  \n \n10.  Malaysia  and  Melaka  have  a  policy  framework  supporting  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment, yet key challenges threaten environmental quality and economic competitiveness. \nCoastal development continues without risk assessment related to impacts of climate change. \nTraffic congestion is worsening and can threaten Melaka\u2019s popularity with tourists. The heritage \narea needs continued improvements and effective management to ensure that tourism goals, \nheritage priorities, and interests of residents can be balanced. The GCAP focuses on the above \nstated issues underscored by water management, energy efficiency and renewable energy, \ngreen transportation, zero waste, urban agriculture and forestry, cultural heritage, and tourism. \nBenchmarking was identified as the first step towards implementation and progress monitoring \nof the GCAP. The following two key activities are among the first steps to implement the GCAP: \n(i) prepare a baseline database with indicators and benchmarks to monitor and evaluate the \nimpact  of  proposed  actions;  and  (ii)  undertake  capacity  building  efforts  to  enhance  local \nknowledge and capabilities in pursuing green actions, and in particular provide the necessary \ncapacity to run the baseline and/or benchmark models that will be handed over to the MGTC \nand the State of Melaka. The S-CDTA will focus on these two activities.  \n                                                \n10  Statement by the Honourable Datuk Faizah Mohd Tahir, Head of Delegation and Secretary General, Ministry of \nWomen, Family and Community Development, Malaysia on Item 4: Population Distribution, Urbanisation, Internal \nMigration and Development at the 41st Session of the Commission on Population and Development, United \nNations, New York. 8th April 2008.  \n  Available at http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/pdf/commission/2008/country/malaysia.pdf   \n11  The 10th Malaysia Plan notes the role of urban agglomerations in the growth process of the country.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The expected impact of the S-CDTA will be a sustainable green city of Melaka with \nimproved urban environmental sustainability and climate resilience. Such improvements will be \nmeasured by adoption and implementation of the GCAP.  \n  \n12.  The outcome of the S-CDTA will be improved capacity for urban planning and capacity \nbuilding of MGTC and local government officials in Melaka. The S-CDTA will draw upon the \nUrban Management Partnership (UMP) program pioneered under the Green City RETA to foster \npeer-to-peer learning in Melaka. Activities supported under the UMP will include initiating a \npartnership with leading institutions such as the Institute for Housing and Urban Development \nStudies,12 and earmarked to undertake Output 2 below (Para 13b). The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The outputs will be: \n \na.  Output  1:  The  PINTAR13 model  developed  as  a  decision-support  system  with \nbaseline  database  and  economy,  environment,  and  equity  (3E)  benchmarking \napproaches,  this  will  analyze  the  extent  to  which  the  green  city  development \ncurrently stay or has progressed as a result of adoption of the GCAP. The PINTAR \nwill be a software tool  with key elements as follows: (i) data and information \nassessment,  analyzing  and  clearly  describing  economic,  demographic,  social, \nenvironmental, fiscal, and governance conditions at spatial scales ranging from the \ncity  level  to  provincial  and  at  the  national  level;  (ii)  development  of  3E \nbenchmarking  methodologies\u2012review  and  assess  applicability  of  available \ncomparable indices, including the applicability of indicators currently being used; (iii) \ndevelopment of baseline database and 3E livability indicators, considering the \nexisting  baseline,  the  business-as-usual  and  alternative  low  emission  and  low \ncarbon, future development scenarios, to include advanced protocols for projecting \ndevelopment trends; (iv) benchmarking Melaka City; and (v) provide hands-on \ntraining to model users and city authorities to understand the methodology and \napplication of the tool. \n \nb.  Output  2:  Capacity  building  and  awareness-raising  workshops  conducted.  This \nincludes the provision of training for the managing of baseline and benchmarking \nmodels that will be handed over to MGTC and Melaka as outlined under Output 1 \nabove. \n  \nc.  Output  3:  Knowledge  sharing  and  awareness-raising  workshops  to  expand  the \nimplementation of the GCAP. \n                                                \n12 The Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies is an international center of excellence of the School of \nEconomics and the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

The  S-CDTA  is  estimated  to  cost  $153,000,  of  which  ADB  will  initially  finance  an \nestimated amount of $150,000 from its TASF-Other Sources to be reimbursed by MGTC.14 The \nMGTC will provide counterpart support in the form of administrative assistance, and other in-\nkind contributions as warranted. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2. \n \n4.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The MGTC will be the executing agency. The S-CDTA will be implemented from 1 \nJanuary 2015 to 31 December 2015. The S-CDTA will require the engagement of two dedicated \nfirms as follows:  \na.  A consultancy firm will be selected on a competitive bid basis for Output 1, with a \nlump-sum contractual payment, using the fixed budget selection method. Under \nOutput 1, the firm will determine the nature and typology of the indicators to be \ncollected to (i) supervise the initial data collection and database development, (ii) \nestablish targets and benchmarks in consultation with local government officials, \nand (iii) plan the continual monitoring through the use of these indicators. \nb.  Due to the diverse skills set required for Output 2, a firm with proven and globally \nrecognized  leader  in  the  areas  concerned  has  been  identified  and  will  be \nengaged through the single source selection (SSS) method. The SSS method is \nmost suitable given the tasks require highly specialized subset of knowledge \nwithin  knowledge  sphere  of  integrated  urban  development  and  environment \nplanning  issues.  The  skills-set  requirements  are  further  narrowed  because \nOutput 2 is a continuation of the previous work under the GCAP,15 thus the TA \ntasks are well-defined and the scope specific. 16 The Institute for Housing and \nUrban Development Studies, International Institute of Urban Management (IHS) \nis the consultancy firm earmarked  to undertake Output 2. IHS will plan and \nconduct  the  expected  workshops  to  provide  the  capacity  building  for  local \ngovernment officials.  \nc.  The firms will be hired in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The draft terms of reference \nfor firms are in Appendix 3 and will be refined in further consultation with the \nMGTC.  The  review  of  the  outputs  will  be  done  by  ADB  and  MGTC,  in \nconsultation with relevant departments in each institution. Proceeds of the TA will \nbe  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010 as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  A national project coordinator and technical resource specialist will also be recruited as \nan individual consultant for 4 person-months to facilitate as the focal point between the firms \nand the MGTC and other stakeholders at the local government unit. The consultant is expected \nto have wide experience in urban planning and development, urban renewal and rehabilitation, \npolicy management, and with institutional analysis with good quantitative skills.   \n \n                                                \n14  The Arrangement of Cooperation between the Government and ADB, dated 25 October 2011 provides the basis \nfor the reimbursement of technical assistance.  \n15  The previous work for the GCAP was financed by ADB under ADB. 2010: Technical Assistance for Public Private \nPartnership in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT.
