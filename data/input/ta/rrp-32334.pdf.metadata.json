An environmental impact assessment was undertaken, \nand the summary was made public through web site of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) on 5 March 2002. \n \nProject Description  The Project is located in Sichuan Province in the poor southwestern \nregion of the PRC. In 2001 the per capita gross domestic product of \nSichuan was about two thirds of the national average. The Project \nwill  support  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy by building an important section of the western region \nroute in Sichuan Province by (i) constructing an expressway across \nhilly to mountainous terrain; (ii) improving local roads servicing poor \ncounties and townships; and (iii) providing consulting services and \ntraining to enhance construction quality, road safety, and project \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \nRationale  To enhance economic development and reduce poverty in the \nwestern part of the PRC, the Government adopted the long-term \nWestern Region Development Strategy, which is the key theme of \nthe  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005).  The  strategy  aims  to \nreduce development disparities between the western and coastal \nregions. The road sector forms an important part of the strategy, \nas it provides a vital link between these two regions. The Project \nwill support the strategy by building part of the western region \nroute  in  Sichuan  Province  and  will  improve  the  access  of  the \nsouthern part of Sichuan Province. \n \nObjectives   The main objective is to accelerate economic development and \nthereby reduce poverty in Sichuan Province. The Project will (i) \nalleviate  congestion  and  reduce  traffic  accidents  and  vehicle \noperating  costs;  (ii)  improve  access  between  Chengdu  and \nKunming, two major centers in the western PRC; and (iii) improve \naccess for the poor rural residents in the transport corridor. The \nProject comprises (i) construction of a 160 kilometer (km) of four-\nlane,  access-controlled  toll  expressway  from  Xichang  to \nPanzhihua, including access roads, interchanges with toll stations, \ntunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) \nupgrading of 558 km of county and township roads to improve \naccess  of  the  poor  and  minority  areas  to  the  economic \nmainstream; (iii) procurement of equipment for road maintenance, \ntoll  collection,  surveillance  and  communications,  vehicle  weigh \nstations,  road  safety,  and  office  administration;  (iv)  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (v)  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision, safety audits, monitoring and evaluation, \nand capacity building. \n ", "iv   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$1,019 million equivalent, of which $464 million (46%) is in foreign \nexchange and $555 million equivalent (54%) in local currency. \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \n    Source \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n    Asian Development Bank   300  0  300 \n    Ministry of Communications   0  145  145 \n    Sichuan Provincial Government   164  144  308 \n    China Development Bank   0  266  266 \n    Total  464  555   1,019 \n%  46  54  100 \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan and Project Agreements. \n \nAllocation and Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will  be  relent  by  the Borrower to Sichuan \nTerms   Province, which will onlend it to the Sichuan Panxi Expressway \nDevelopment  Shareholding  Company  Limited  (also  known  as \nSichuan Panxi Expressway Company Limited [SPECL]) with the \nsame financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \nSPECL will bear the interest rate variation and foreign exchange \nrisks. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2008 \n \nEstimated Project   30 September 2007 \nCompletion Date   \n \nImplementation  The project implementation unit  established  within  SPECL  will be \nArrangements  responsible for the expressway. Sichuan Province will implement \nthe local road component through local governments.   \n \nExecuting Agency  Sichuan Provincial Communications Department (SPCD) \n \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for \nthe expressway will be procured through international competitive \nbidding. Civil works for local roads will be procured through local \ncompetitive  bidding  or  force  account.  On  7  March  2002,  ADB \napproved advance action for procurement of civil works. Equipment \nwill  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  or \ninternational shopping. \n \nConsulting Services  About 64 person-months of international consulting services will \nbe provided under the Project to (i) assist in project management \n ", "    v\n \nduring the construction period; (ii) provide expertise in tunnel and \nbridge  construction;  (iii)  conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project \ndesign, and make recommendations on improving the safety of \ncompleted  construction  works;  (iv)  help  set  up  and  implement \nquality  control  procedures;  (v)  assist  in  formulating  a  human \nresource  development  and  training  program;  and  (vi)  help \nestablish  and  implement  a  project  performance  management \nsystem,  including  assessing  the  impact  on  poverty  reduction. \nAbout 4,350 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired for construction supervision. The international consultants \nwill be financed from the ADB loan and be recruited based on the \nquality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. On 7 March 2002, ADB \napproved  advance  action  for  recruitment  of  international \nconsultants. The domestic consultants will be financed by SPCD \nand will be recruited in accordance with Government procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nProject Benefits and   By improving local roads to poor counties and townships  in addition \nBeneficiaries  to  constructing  the  expressway,  the  Project  will  help  improve \naccess to market opportunities and social services for the poor rural \nresidents in the project area. The Project will reduce transport time \nand costs, and thereby promote investments, enhance incomes, \nand create employment opportunities. The economic internal rate of \nreturn is estimated at 16.2%. The financial internal rate of return \nafter tax for the expressway component is 5.5%, which is higher \nthan the real weighted average cost of capital. There are 197,000 \nproject beneficiaries, or 20% of the total, living below the income \nlevels of CNY1,000 in rural and CNY3,000 in urban areas. The \ndistribution analysis shows that the proportion of net project benefits \npassed on to the poor, or the poverty impact ratio, is 24%. This ratio \nis higher than the country\u2019s poverty incidence and the income share \nof  the  poor.  The  main  project  beneficiaries  of  the  local  road \ncomponent will be households in poor counties and townships in \nthe project area, providers of rural transport services, industrial and \nagricultural  businesses,  agriculture-based  households  producing \ngrains  and  vegetables  for  local  markets,  people  visiting  the \nhistorical sites along the expressway alignment, people living in the \nproject area who will have easier access to long-distance transport \nservices, and transport operators and their customers for transit \ntraffic. The Project will also help reduce traffic accidents, vehicle \nemissions, and traffic noise on the existing roads. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project was formulated to reduce potential risks. The main \ntechnical risks are associated with the extensive tunnel and bridge \nstructures.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  international  consultants \nreviewed  the  proposed  design  and  construction  methods. \nPrequalification  of  contractors  focuses  on  their  financial  and \ntechnical  capability  in  handling  complex  works.  During  the \nconstruction  period,  monitoring  and  contract  management \ninformation  systems  will  be  set  up  and  implemented,  with  the \nassistance of the international consultants, for timely identification \n ", "vi   \nof technical problems and implementation of corrective measures. \nEconomic performance in the project influence area would have to \ndeteriorate substantially for the Project to lose economic viability. \nThe financial risk associated with construction and operation of \nthe expressway will depend on the actual construction costs when \ncontracts are awarded and the subsequent implementation. To \nmitigate this risk, SPECL is consciously oriented to building up a \ncommercial business environment for expressway operations, and \nthe project expressway will receive substantial equity from the \ncentral and provincial governments.  \n \n \n ", " ", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  (RRP)1 on  a \nproposed  loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Southern  Sichuan  Roads \nDevelopment Project (The project framework is in Appendix 1).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Despite the Government's efforts to increase the country's transport capacity, serious \nconstraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road sector. Between 1990 and 2000, when \neconomic  growth  averaged  10.2%  per  annum,  road  traffic  grew  at  9.7%  per  annum  for \npassenger traffic, reaching 660 billion passenger-kilometer (km) and 5.9% per annum for freight, \nreaching 597 billion ton-km. Road traffic accounts for 54.2% of total passenger traffic and 13.7% \nof total freight traffic (Supplementary Appendix A). The movement of goods and passengers will \nincreasingly be by road, as road transport is more flexible and responsive to needs in a market \neconomy than other modes. In addition, car ownership is growing, and an increasing proportion \nof passengers are traveling by road. \n \n3.  The road network grew from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.68 million km in 2001 equivalent \nto an annual increase of 86,700 km. Of this, the expressway length increased from 2,141 km to \n19,437 km during the same period. 2 But the road network is still underdeveloped in both quality \nand extent. High standard roads, i.e., above class II, account for only about 13% of the total road \nnetwork, and the remaining 87% (class III road and below) are medium- to low-grade paved roads \nand gravel roads. With only 1,100 km of roads per million inhabitants, the density of the PRC's \nroad network is low.3 Road density relative to the area increased from 12.1 km per 100 square km \n(km2) in 1995 to 14.6 km per 100 km2 in 2000. Of the 92,000 km of roads in Sichuan Province in \n2001, 1,152 km were expressways. Roads are generally of low standard. The 78% in class IV or \nlower in Sichuan is a higher share of low-quality roads than that for the PRC as a whole. \nSichuan has about 1,091 km of classified roads per million inhabitants, slightly below the \nnational average. \n \n4.  The significant road sector development during the 9th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (1996\u2013\n2000)  reflected  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  stimulate  the  economy  through  public \ninvestment in the road sector. Because of the need to remove transport bottlenecks to facilitate \nefficient, sustained economic growth and reduce poverty, the Government implemented a large \ninvestment program in the road sector during this period, totaling CNY924 billion, or CNY185 \nbillion per year, up from CNY242 billion, or CNY48 billion per year, during the 8th FYP (1991\u2013\n1995). The road sector investment grew at an average annual rate of 16% during this period. The \nGovernment will have difficulty sustaining this level of investment even with official development \nassistance. An increasing proportion of financing will have to come from private sector sources. A \nroad sector analysis is included in Appendix 2. The road sector revenue and expenditures in \nSichuan Province is given in Supplementary Appendix B. \n                                                 \n1  This report was prepared by the project team, comprising M.

Tas-Anvaripour, Financial Management Specialist. \n2  The PRC\u2019s expressway length is second in the world after the United States. \n3  Comparative figures for km of road per million inhabitants in other geographically large countries are about 25,300 \nkm for the United States and 1,800 km for India. ", "2   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Sichuan Province is a poor interior area in western PRC. In 2001 the per capita gross \ndomestic product (GDP) of the province was about two thirds of the national average. The key \nproblem in Sichuan Province is poverty: the per capita GDP was CNY5,118 in 2001, or 68% of \nthe national average. The per capita rural income was CNY1,987, or 84% of the national \naverage. About one third of the counties in Sichuan are officially designated poor counties. In \nthe project area, 197,000 poor project beneficiaries, or 20%, are living below the income levels \nof CNY1,000 in rural areas and CNY3,000 in urban areas. An overview of the poverty reduction \nand the government\u2019s social strategy is given in Appendix 3. One of the reasons for high poverty \nincidence is slow economic growth, partly because of inadequate infrastructure. Despite the \nconsiderable investments, the road network is still inadequate, and does not provide efficient \ntransport access to large parts of the country. Better transport links are necessary to improve \neconomic efficiency, foster domestic and international trade, facilitate interregional integration, \nand reduce poverty.   \n \n6.  The traffic volume on the existing roads in the project area has been increasing at about \n11% per annum in the last few years, reaching 2,350 vehicles per day to 9,700 vehicles per day \ndepending on sections in 2001. The roads are already at capacity in certain sections. If the new \nroad  is  not  constructed,  traffic  will  be  suppressed  and  transport  costs  will  increase.  The \nrestricted traffic movements will slow economic growth of the project area. Based on the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-financed technical assistance (TA),4 the forecast traffic volume on the \nexpressway is expected to grow from 6,300 medium truck equivalents (MTEs) in 2008 to 11,900 \nMTEs in 2018, a 6.6% average annual growth rate. It will grow more slowly at 5.6% per annum \nthereafter to reach 20,400 MTEs in 2028 (Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix C). The \nprojected volumes justify the construction of an expressway. \n \n7.  The impact of transport infrastructure investments on poverty reduction is demonstrated \nby recent studies using an econometric model, which examined the effectiveness of government \nexpenditure in various sectors in contributing to growth and poverty reduction in the PRC and \nIndonesia.5 The studies concluded that investments in road infrastructure have the largest \nimpact on poverty reduction, productivity, and growth. The importance of road infrastructure in \nimproving quality of life is highlighted in the ADB-financed Rural Asia Study.6 The link between \ntransport development and poverty reduction is also supported by studies and evaluation of \nseveral completed transport projects, financed by ADB7 and the World Bank.8 A regional TA9 is \nbeing implemented to examine the poverty reduction impact of infrastructure projects. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000.

The private sector will be the PRC\u2019s engine of employment generation and a main \nmechanism to increase productivity\u2014two essential instruments to reduce poverty. According to \nthe  ADB  surveys10 infrastructure  constraints  are  among  the  impediments  faced  by  private \ncompanies operating in the PRC. Of 756 firms interviewed, 21% cited poor roads as a major \nconstraint, which is the second most frequently cited infrastructure constraint after land and \nbuildings. If private investment is to be attracted to the poor interior provinces by creating an \nenabling framework, road infrastructure, among other things, needs to be improved.  \n \n9.  The Government adopted the long-term Western Region Development Strategy, which \nis the key theme of the 10th FYP (2001\u20132005) to enhance economic development and reduce \npoverty in the western part of the country, where most poor reside. The strategy aims to reduce \ndevelopment disparities between the western region and the coastal region. The proposed \nProject will support the strategy by building one of the eight western region routes11 and improve \nthe access of Chengdu and other cities in the poor western region. \n \n10.  To  help  the  Government  develop  and  implement  its  road  sector  strategy,  external \nassistance has been provided mainly from ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n(JBIC), and the World Bank (Appendix 5). Since 1991, ADB has provided 22 loans totaling \nnearly $3.6 billion to finance 3,000 km of road development, together with the associated 4,484 \nkm local road network. Local roads have been included in the project scope since 1995 to make \nADB\u2019s interventions in the road sector more pro-poor. ADB\u2019s assistance to the road subsector \nhas been effective and successful in achieving the project objectives. Among the projects \nfinanced by ADB, 12 have been completed and are open to traffic. The project completion \nreports  (PCRs)  prepared  for  7  road  projects  concluded  that  six  projects  were  generally \nsuccessful,12 and one was partly successful.13 The project performance audit reports14 for three \nroad  projects  concluded  that  the  projects  were  either  highly  successful  or  successful.  A \ndevelopment impact study15 of the 1,867 km Beijing-Tongjiang expressway route, for which ADB \nprovided  loans  totaling  $1.2  billion,  showed  that  the  improved  road  network  significantly \ncontributed to the development of the northeastern part of the PRC. A midterm review and \nprocurement review of the ongoing road project16 being implemented by the same executing \nagency  were  undertaken  in  2001  and  concluded  that  the  project  is  being  implemented \nsatisfactorily in principle. Lessons learned from these reviews cover implementation-related \nmatters, including (i) ADB procurement guidelines and requirements were not always followed; \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2002.

ADB has also provided the road \nsector with 41 TAs totaling $21.5 million. The advisory TAs have supported the development of \nroad infrastructure by addressing policy and institutional issues, including highway planning, \nroad  safety, 17  human  resource  development,  transport  pricing,  commercialization  and \ncorporatization, and mobilization of nongovernment financial resources. ADB\u2019s assistance has \nbeen complemented by the World Bank and JBIC, which have provided about $5.3 billion and \n$990 million to finance road infrastructure investments. ADB's policy dialogue in the road sector \nand identification of projects are coordinated with the World Bank and JBIC. \n \n11.  ADB's operational strategy18 in the PRC\u2019s road sector supports (i) construction of roads \nthat connect major growth centers and promote linkages with hinterland economies; (ii) integration \nof the network so that the national trunk highway system is supported by a system of local roads, \nparticularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) promotion of road safety and vehicle \nemission reduction; (iv) institutional strengthening to increase the commercial orientation and \nefficiency of expressway organizations; (v) improvement of highway planning and evaluation \ntechniques; (vi) adoption of appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport \ncapacity; and (vii) use of alternative methods of investment financing, including private sector \nparticipation. Consistent with this strategy, the policy dialogue with the Government focused on \nkey issues, including enhancing poverty impact and monitoring of road projects, improving road \nsafety, reducing vehicle emissions, strengthening corporate governance, facilitating private sector \ndevelopment. These constitute special features of the Project (paras. 15\u201322) and are detailed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n12.  During the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor assistance for the Project. A feasibility study19 and a resettlement plan were prepared by the \nSichuan  Highway  Design  Institute.  The  Highway  Research  Institute  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications undertook an environmental impact assessment (EIA).20 ADB provided TA \n(footnote 4) to supplement the Government studies. Fact-finding for the Project was undertaken \nfrom  22  November  to  5  December  2001  and  appraisal  from  12  to  22  March  2002.  Loan \nnegotiations with authorized representatives of the Government were conducted in Manila from \n5 to 7 August 2002. The Project was formulated based on the findings of the ADB missions, \ninformation  provided  by  the  Government,  beneficiary  consultations,  discussions  with  other \nfunding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. The Project \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17 In January 2001, ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department completed a performance audit report on traffic safety \nTAs.

", "  5\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n13.  The principal objectives of the Project are to promote economic growth and reduce \npoverty in the southern part of Sichuan Province by lowering the cost of transport, relieving \ntraffic congestion, and improving access in the project area (Map 1). The Project will (i) alleviate \ncongestion  and  reduce  traffic  accidents  and  vehicle  operating  costs;  (ii)  improve  access \nbetween Chengdu and Kunming, two major centers in western PRC; (iii) provide additional \ntransport capacity to accommodate traffic growth due to economic growth and the shift to more \nflexible  road  based  transportation;  and  (iv)  provide  improved  access  for  the  poor  rural \npopulation in the transport corridor.  The Project will also support reforms relating to poverty \nreduction, road safety and vehicle emissions, and corporate governance. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n14.  The Project comprises the following: (i) construction of a 160 km, four-lane access-\ncontrolled toll expressway from Xichang to Panzhihua, including access roads, interchanges \nwith toll stations, tunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) upgrading of \n558 km of county and township roads to improve access to poor and minority areas (Map 2); (iii) \nprocurement  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  toll  collection,  surveillance  and \ncommunications,  vehicle  weigh  stations,  road  safety,  and  office  administration;  (iv)  land \nacquisition and resettlement; and (v) consulting services for construction supervision, safety \naudits, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. The key inputs needed to implement \nthe Project include civil works, consultants, equipment, and staff of the Sichuan Provincial \nCommunications Department (SPCD) and the Sichuan Panxi Expressway Company Limited \n(SPECL).  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Targeting Poor Beneficiaries \n \n15.  ADB and the Government have had extensive discussions on how to enhance the \npoverty  reduction  impact  of  road  investments.  The  policy  dialogue  focused  on  three  main \nissues. First, the location of ADB-financed road sector projects has shifted from the northeast \nand coastal areas to the poorer central and southwest regions. This shift to poorer interior \nprovinces is in line with the 10th FYP. Second, the dialogue focused on the inclusion of local \nroads under ADB-financed road projects. Since 1995, the scope of ADB-financed road projects21 \nhas  included  improvements  to  local  roads  connecting  to  the  expressway  interchanges  to \nfacilitate access of rural communities to county centers and to the expressway facilities. The \nscope of the Project includes upgrading 558 km of local roads that will connect poor areas to the \nexpressway interchanges. This local road component was added to the project scope at ADB\u2019s \ninitiative and was formulated by prioritizing road sections that serve areas where most poor \npeople live and where the most beneficial impact can be made on poverty reduction. Third, \n                                                 \n21 Chengdu-Nanchong  Expressway  Project,  Chongqing-Guizhou  Roads  Development  Projects  (Leichong \nExpressway/Chongzun Expressway), Guangxi Roads Development Project, Hebei Expressway Project, Hebei \nRoads  Development  Project,  Jiangxi  Expressway  Project,  Liaoning  Expressway  Project,  Shaanxi  Roads \nDevelopment Project, Shanxi Road Development Project, Shenyang-Jinzhou Expressway Project, and Southern \nYunnan Road Development Project. The local road components of these projects are being implemented or have \nbeen completed successfully, helping improve living conditions of the poor people in the project area. ", "6   \nADB\u2019s agenda for policy dialogue included maximizing employment of poor people during road \nconstruction.  Specific  measures  have  been  formulated  in  the  Project  to  support  these \nobjectives. \n \n16.  The project area is very diverse in terms of climate, topography, ecology, economy, and \nsocial structure. The project area covers poor counties of Dechang, Miyi, and Yanbian; small \nparts of Huili, Renhe, and Xichang counties, and the urban district of Panzhihua. The total \npopulation  living  in  the  project  area  is  1.2  million,  of  which  about  1.0  million  are  project \nbeneficiaries. About 137,000 rural residents, or about 34% of rural beneficiaries (406,000), have \nannual incomes of less than CNY1,000 while 60,000 urban residents, or about 11% of urban \nbeneficiaries (563,000), have annual incomes of less than CNY3,000.  \n \n17.  The local road component directly targeting poor and minority villages in the mountains \nwill  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  construction  of  the  expressway.    While  the  poor \nthemselves may not directly use the expressway, they will make use of the local roads to sell \ntheir produce to others who will use the expressway to transport the goods to markets in \nPanzhihua, Xichang, and beyond, or to supply agricultural inputs inputs, such as fertilizer, \npesticides, and seeds. The poor could pool resources in the future to purchase vehicles that \ncould use the expressway to access major markets. \n \n18.  To  ensure  that  the  project  benefits  accrue  to  poor  people  as  intended,  a  set  of \nmonitorable poverty impact indicators was developed in consultation with the SPCD based on \nfindings of ongoing TA, which supports the rural poverty reduction projects in the PRC. The \nmain indicators will include poverty incidence, rural incomes, production of grain crops, housing \nconditions, productive assets, access to markets, access to basic infrastructure, access to \nhealth and education services, and off-farm economic activities. Baseline indicators and targets \nwill be worked out at the beginning of project implementation. The poverty monitoring will be \ncarried  out  as  part  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (para.  40  and \nSupplementary Appendix D) with the support of 26 person-months of consulting assistance. A \nTA, Socioeconomic Assessment of Road Projects, which is under processing, will strengthen \npoverty monitoring by providing advice and assistance to SPCD.    \n \n  2.  Road Safety and Vehicle Emissions \n \n19.  Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC and in Sichuan province. The 2001 accident \nstatistics for the PRC were 755,000 accidents, 106,000 fatalities, and 536,000 injuries. Sichuan \nProvince had 39,090 reported accidents, 5,727 fatalities, and 31,972 injuries. To address this \nissue, the Ministry of Public Security has prepared the 2002 Road Safety Action Plan, which \naims to (i) reduce serious accidents, involving more than 10 fatalities, by 10% compared with \n2001; and (ii) eliminate major accidents, involving 30 or more fatalities.22 This would be achieved \nthrough  improved  safety  of  vehicles,  driver  training,  and  improved  traffic  management.  In \nSichuan, the Road Safety Council was established to investigate road accidents, and prepare \ncodes and standards for accident prevention. To enforce traffic regulations for a completed 70 \nkm section adjoining the project expressway, a highway patrol team was organized by the \nPublic Security Bureau. It will be expanded to work on the project expressway. To strengthen \nthe  capacity  of  the  Road  Safety  Council  and  the  highway  patrol  team,  assistance  will  be \nprovided to the public security bureau under the international consulting services through in-\ncountry training for concerned staff. Assistance will also be provided, in light of the findings of \n                                                 \n22 In 2000, 39 accidents involved 10 or more fatalities and 4 accidents involved 30 or more fatalities. ", "  7\nthe ongoing ADB TA23 on road safety, to review and improve (i) provincial road safety guidelines \nfor the interdepartmental road safety initiatives; and (ii) road safety action plans for Liangshan \nand Panzhihua prior to opening of the project expressway (Appendix 6). \n \n20.  With a rapid increase in vehicle ownership, vehicle emissions have also become a serious \nissue in the PRC. Vehicle emissions will have an adverse impact on the environment if no \nmitigation measures are taken. Fragmented responsibility, lack of interdepartmental coordination, \nand an inadequate database and monitoring system prevent the formulation of specific targets for \na reduction in vehicle emissions. Sichuan Province has an annual program for testing vehicle \nemissions. Road-side testing is carried out in Panzhihua city where the project alignment passes. \nTo address the motor vehicle emissions issue, international consultants will provide training to \nstaff  of  the  environmental  protection  bureau  involved  with  vehicle  emissions  inspection  and \ntesting. Assistance will also be provided, in light of the findings of the recently completed ADB \nTA24 on vehicle emissions, to review and improve (i) general provincial guidelines for vehicle \nemissions reduction, and (ii) action plans for Liangshan and Panzhihua prior to opening of the \nproject expressway (Appendix 6). \n \n3.  Corporate Governance \n \n21.  An expressway company, SPECL, was established in September 1998 as a joint stock, \nlimited liability company to construct and operate expressway sections, including the proposed \nproject expressway. However, it still operates as an implementing department of SPCD, rather \nthan  as  an  autonomous  corporate  entity.  SPECL\u2019s  initial  objective  is  to  build  the  project \nexpressway as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Its management team and staff will \nprimarily  be  involved  in  project  construction  management.  The  company  must  have  the \nprofessional  resources  and  experience,  and  the  management,  accounting,  and  reporting \nsystems required for the efficient and safe operation of its existing and future expressways. \nSPECL needs to be managed independently by its board, reporting its financial performance to \nits shareholders. SPECL should develop its management, corporate, and financial reporting \nprocedures  in  compliance  with  government  and  international  practices  to  satisfy  the \nrequirements of private investors. SPECL\u2019s ultimate objective should be to operate as a private \ncommercial road management company. SPCD and SPECL agreed to enter into a concession \nframework  agreement  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  by  30  June  2004,  which  will  ensure \nautonomy of operations, encourage the establishment of road facility performance indicators, \nand facilitate future refinancing of road sector assets. SPCD and SPECL agreed to implement \nthe  corporate  development  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  by  31  December  2004  to \ndemonstrate  that  the  standard  of  its  corporate  governance,  management  procedures,  and \nfinancial reporting satisfies the requirements of international investors. \n   \n4.  Private Sector Development \n \n22.  In line with ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy, consideration was given to \nalternative approaches to highway financing  recommended  under  a  recently  completed  ADB  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 1999.

", "8   \nTA,25 including  securitization  of  ADB-financed  projects.26 The  potential  for  pursuing  these \noptions for financing the project expressway were examined. Capacity to attract nongovernment \nfinancing, particularly equity capital, for road projects such as the project expressway with low \ninitial demand and low financial returns, but with high long-term economic returns, is limited.  \nTherefore,  the  construction  of  the  Project  will  be  financed  from  public  sources  with  funds \nmodified from a variety of sources including national financial bonds, development banks, public \nequity contributions, and ADB. Nevertheless, establishing a sound administrative structure using \nmodern business principles at the outset may make it possible for the operator to secure \nnongovernment  financing  at  a  later  stage,  depending  on  traffic  buildup  and  financial \nperformance. Nongovernment financing options will be examined before operations start. ADB \nwill favorably consider such refinancing for the Project, provided that advance notice is received \nand  the  proposal  meets  ADB\u2019s  standards  of  good  governance,  transparency,  and  project \nviability.  An  overview  of  private  sector  involvement  in  the  PRC  road  sector  is  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n  5.  Environmental Assessment \n \n23.  The Project is classified as environment category A. The EIA concluded that no major \nadverse environmental impacts will result provided the recommended mitigation measures27 are \nimplemented. The TA consultants (footnote 4) and field visits by ADB staff confirmed the EIA \nconclusion. The summary EIA28 for the Project was uploaded on ADB\u2019s web site on 5 March \n2002.  In  addition  to  following  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Projects, all applicable PRC laws and regulations will be complied with during \nimplementation  and  operation.  To  ensure  that  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of \nproject construction and operation are minimized, the environmental monitoring program and \nmitigation measures, as specified in the EIA, will be implemented. \n6.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan \n \n24.  The land acquisition for the construction of the project expressway will result in some \nloss of land, houses, and other assets. A resettlement plan was prepared for the affected people \nbased on the 1998 Land Administration Law29 and provincial guidelines. It was reviewed by the \nTA consultants and the Mission and confirmed by the detailed measurement survey based on \nthe detail design alignment in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements for involuntary resettlement. \nAbout 11,000 people (2,400 households) will be affected. Among these, 6,040 people (1,290 \nhouseholds) will be affected by either house or building losses and will be relocated. Those \nlosing land will be compensated through their economic collectives, according to the 1998 Land \nAdministration Law and the provincial guidelines. The Project will permanently acquire about \n825 hectares (ha), plus about 117 ha of temporarily borrowed land for construction purposes. \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 1997.

Under the \ntwo projects, the expressways' future toll revenue was securitized through an initial public offering in August 1999 \nand January 1999. \n27 They include (i) countermeasures to reduce noise for the residents near the alignment; (ii) preventive measures \nsuch as planting of trees and grasses, and construction of side ditches, torrent chutes, slope walls, and retaining \nwalls to prevent soil erosion; and (iii) measures to prevent adverse impacts at borrow and spoil sites through \ncontracts containing environmental covenants and by supervising consultants during implementation. During \nexpressway operation, SPECL will help monitor vehicle emissions on the expressway in cooperation with the local \nenvironmental protection bureau, traffic police, and other related organizations. \n28 Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Environment/PRC/roads_devt.pdf \n29 The law was drafted with assistance provided under ADB. 1996.

", "  9\nThe resettlement budget estimate of CNY541 million is included in the project cost estimates. \nNo  houses  are  expected  to  be  affected  and  no  relocation  necessary  for  the  local  road \ncomponent as the work will be done mostly on the existing alignment. If any resettlement effects \nare associated with the local roads, the same resettlement policy will apply. The resettlement \nplan meets ADB\u2019s requirements for involuntary resettlement. \n \n25.  SPCD  will  fund  the  resettlement  costs  according  to  the  standards  set  out  in  the \nresettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  government  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nresettlement. Compensation will be paid for housing, and new housing will be made available \nbefore relocation takes place. In line with the relevant law, the resettlement information booklet \nwas released to affected people through county and township offices and local media on 6 \nFebruary 2002, and the summary resettlement plan30 (Appendix 7) was disclosed to the public \nthrough ADB\u2019s web site on 5 March 2002. The full resettlement plan31 (Supplementary Appendix \nH) was also posted on ADB\u2019s web site on 8 May 2002. The resettlement booklet contains \nresettlement impacts, the resettlement policy, compensation rates and policies, organizational \narrangements,  consultation  and  participation,  and  grievance  procedures.  SPCD  will  be \nresponsible for internally monitoring the resettlement implementation and for submitting reports \nto ADB. A regular reporting system was established to ensure key resettlement activities are \nimplemented on time. SPCD will engage a local institute to carry out independent monitoring of \nthe resettlement implementation. Further surveys will be done on completion of the resettlement \nand 1 year later, and the findings reported to SPCD and ADB. \n \n  7.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n \n26.  Stakeholder  participation  and  consultations  have  been  an  important  element  in  the \ndevelopment and design of the Project. They have involved over 900 people, since beginning in \nMarch 1997 (i) during the preparation of the feasibility study, EIA, and resettlement plan; (ii) to \ninform the people affected about the project objectives and to understand their priorities, needs, \nand concerns; (iii) to dialogue with the county and township representatives in the project area to \nensure that local concerns are adequately addressed in the project design; and (iv) through \ndiscussions with NGOs. A number of surveys, consultations, and discussions were held with the \nminority population of the project area. These surveys and discussions provided much of the \nquantitative and qualitative information, which has been used as the basis for identifying the \npotential project impacts and assessing their significance. Surveys in communities served by \nthese roads revealed a high degree of support for the Project (Appendix 8).  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n27.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $1,019 million equivalent, with a foreign \nexchange cost of $464 million (46%) and a local currency cost of $555 million (54%) equivalent \nas shown in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 9. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n30 This is included in the summary EIA (on-line) (footnote 28). \n31 Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/southern_sichuan_roads.pdf ", "10  \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The Government has requested a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0% (the fee will be capitalized in \nthe  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB.

The loan will finance about 65% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project and 30% of \nthe total project cost. The remaining foreign exchange cost of $164 million will be financed by \nthe Sichuan Provincial Government (SPG). The local currency cost will be financed by SPG, \nMinistry of Communications, and cofinancing through a loan from the China Development Bank. \nThe China Development Bank loan, which is already effective, is repayable over 18 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, and at a variable lending rate, currently at 5.76% per \nannum.  ", "  11\n30.  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to Sichuan Province, which will onlend to \nSPECL with the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. SPECL will bear \nthe interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n31.  SPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the \nProject. Part of SPCD was corporatized to form SPECL to be the Implementing Agency for the \nproject expressway. SPECL has a board of directors and will have sufficient technical, financial, \nand administrative staff (Supplementary Appendix I). Most of the staff have experience in \nimplementing internationally financed road projects. Sichuan Province will implement the local \nroad  component  through  local  governments.  The  project  director,  general  manager  of  the \nSPECL,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management,  approval  of  contracts,  and \npayments. A project implementation unit established within SPECL will monitor and follow up \nimplementation.  The  unit  is  headed  by  a  project  manager  responsible  for  physical \nimplementation activities on a day-to-day basis and the preparation of progress reports. The \nproject manager is assisted by a team of qualified engineering, financial, and administrative \nstaff. SPECL has sufficient technical capability to handle the Project as their engineers have \nexperience  in  implementing  internationally  financed  road  projects.  However,  its  institutional \ncapacity needs to be developed. Assistance will be provided under the consulting services in \nthis respect. A land acquisition and resettlement committee was established under SPG to \nensure the appropriate agencies and authorities coordinate land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities. \n2.    Period of Implementation \n \n32.  The Project will be implemented over about 5 years from December 2002 to September \n2007  (Appendix  10).  The  local  road  component  will  be  implemented  concurrently  with \nexpressway construction. \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n33.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  The civil \nworks for the expressway will be divided into 19 packages to be procured under international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Equipment will be divided into 8 packages and procured under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  or  international  shopping.  Ancillary  facilities  including  the \nadministration  building  and  service  areas  under  domestic  financing  will  be  procured  in  16 \npackages using local competitive bidding. Procurement for the local roads under government \nfinancing will follow Government procedures acceptable to ADB (Appendix 11). International \nbidding will be handled by the China International Tendering Company, selected by SPECL on a \ncompetitive basis. It is well qualified to perform these tasks and has previous experience in \nother externally funded projects. Prequalified contractors with adequate technical and financial \ncapacities will be allowed to bid for several packages and, if successful, may be awarded more \nthan one contract based on least-cost combination of contracts. SPECL has agreed to include \nthe relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy in all documents and contracts during \nbidding for and implementation of the Project. \n ", "12  \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n34.  Construction  supervision  activities,  involving  4,350  person-months  of  consulting \nservices, will be undertaken by domestic consulting teams under government financing, headed \nby a chief supervision engineer. SPCD will use the regulations and guidelines prepared under \nan ADB TA32 for selecting and engaging consultants. Each contract package will be supervised \nby a site resident engineer assisted by a deputy resident engineer and supported by technical \nand  administrative  personnel.  The  site  resident  engineer  will  report  to  the  chief  resident \nengineer. The chief supervision engineer will report to the project manager of SPECL. \n \n35.  The Project will provide 64 person-months of international consulting services to (i) help \nwith project management during the construction period; (ii) provide expertise in tunnel and \nbridge  construction;  (iii)  conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project  design,  and  make  safety \nrecommendations on the completed construction works; (iv) help set up and implement quality \ncontrol procedures; (v) help develop capacity in road safety and vehicle emissions, and improve \nguidelines  and  action  plans  in  this  regard;  (vi)  prepare  a  procedural  manual  for  good \nmanagement of SPECL; (vii) assist in formulating a human resource development and training \nprogram; and (viii) help establish and implement a project performance management system, \nincluding assessing the impact on poverty reduction (Supplementary Appendix J). The team \nleader will be in the field during the entire construction period and will act as assistant chief \nsupervision engineer: helping the chief supervision engineer certify variation orders, contractor \npayments, and subcontracting documents, and establishing a contracts management system. \nAll consultants to be financed under the ADB loan will be selected and engaged based on the \nquality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Domestic consultants experienced in implementing similar road projects will be \nfinanced  by  SPECL,  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  government  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n5.  Advance Action  \n \n36.  Because of the high priority accorded to the Project and the need to commence works in \nDecember 2002, on 7 March 2002 ADB approved advance procurement action for civil works \nand  advance  recruitment  action  for  international  consultants.33 Advance  actions  up  to  the \nevaluation  of  bids  and  proposals,  but  not  including  award  of  contracts,  covers  (i)  the \nprequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation for the civil works contract packages; \nand (ii) recruitment of international consultants to help implement the Project.  The advance \nactions  are  being  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government and SPCD have been advised that \napproval of the advance actions does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n37.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. The disbursement procedures will include (i) a direct payment \nprocedure, (ii) a commitment procedure, or (iii) a reimbursement procedure. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n32 ADB. 1998. TA to the PRC for Regulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants. Manila. \n33 The advance action was reported in the April 2002 edition of ADB Business Opportunities. ", "  13\n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n38.  SPECL will maintain separate accounts for the Project, and have such accounts and \nrelated financial statements (balance sheet, income statements, and cash-flow statements) \naudited annually in accordance with national auditing standards consistently applied by external \nauditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  the \nGovernment and ADB. In addition, it will submit to ADB within 9 months of the end of each \nrelated fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project accounts and financial statements, \nand the report of the auditors of the Project as acceptable to ADB, all in the English language. \nSPECL will follow the audit report formats adopted for all ADB-financed projects in the PRC. \nThe formats provide an example of the auditor's certificate in accordance with the Government \nrequirement as well as a model auditor's report to ensure compliance with the Loan Agreement \nand internal control on financial reporting. To ensure that internal controls and checks on the \nexpressway construction costs and operations are effective, SPECL has established, at ADB\u2019s \nsuggestion,  an  internal  audit  unit  and  will  maintain  it  during  project  implementation  and \noperation.  The  unit  will  undertake  independent  tests  on  day-to-day  transactions,  prior  to \nreference to external auditors. \n \n39.  SPECL  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation by submitting quarterly progress reports and brief monthly updates.  Within 3 \nmonths of completion, SPECL will submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n40.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, \noutputs, and conditions was discussed and agreed upon with SPECL (Supplementary Appendix \nD). The indicators will be reviewed at the start of project implementation and will include (i) \neconomic development and poverty indicators for Sichuan Province and the project area, (ii) \ntransport costs and time for specific types of vehicles and trips, (iii) transport services and \ntransport  charges,  (iv)  accident  rates,  (v)  financial  sustainability,  (vi)  county  and  township \nincomes per capita, (vii) access to social services, and (viii) jobs created in construction and \nmaintenance. Employment impact indicators will include information about unskilled laborers, \npoor laborers, and women laborers, and will be monitored through an annual report. At the \nbeginning of project implementation, SPECL will establish baseline and target values for the \nindicators.  The  indicators  will  be  measured  at  project  completion  and  3  years  later,  and \ncompared  with  the  baseline.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender. \nSPECL will recruit a qualified consultant for monitoring and evaluation to help establish the \nmonitoring and evaluation system, and train the staff of SPECL and implementing agencies in \nits use. The main sources of data used include (i) a review of secondary data from government \nsources, (ii) a household socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rural appraisal \nwith the help of nongovernment organizations in communities affected by the expressway and \nlocal roads. A report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 \nyears later will be submitted to ADB. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n41.  In  2005,  ADB,  SPCD,  and  SPECL  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project, \ncovering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty \nreduction, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the \nperformance of the Project and its continuing viability.  The review will examine progress in ", "14  \nsector reforms, policy development, progress in resettlement, and compliance with assurances \nin the loan agreement. \n \n  10.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n42.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB's program \nfor the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and provide incentives to reduce \nthe incidence of corruption in the longer term. \n \n43.  Based on SPCD\u2019s experience in fighting corruption, the following actions have been \ntaken to prevent corruption: (i) a leading group of officials from the Provincial Discipline Unit and \nSupervision  Department  will  be  resident  in  project  offices  for  bidding,  construction,  and \noperations; (ii) a supervisory \"watchdog\" body has been established to prevent interference in \nthe processes; (iii) a two-contract system has been established where the winner of a civil works \ncontract must also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iv)  liaison meetings \nbetween  SPCD  and  the  Provincial  Prosecutor's  Office  are  held  on  a  regular  basis  where \nwarnings about or information on corrupt practices can be discussed; and (v) midyear and end-\nof-year inspections of contractors have been instituted to ensure procedures related to fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are being followed. \n \n11.  Capacity Building and Human Resource Development \n \n44.  To cope with its increased expressway construction and management activities, SPECL \nneeds to develop a corporate strategy and outline its managerial, staffing, and investment \nrequirements. A human resource development plan will be drawn up with the help of the \ninternational and domestic consultants. The plan will consider the needs, and the recruitment \nand training requirements identified. One element of the plan will be an international training \nprogram financed under the loan. It will cover expressway operations, commercial development \nof  expressways  and  business  planning,  expressway  maintenance,  road  safety,  vehicle \nemissions, project management, highway development planning, monitoring and evaluation, \nenvironmental management, bridge and tunnel design, traffic engineering, toll management, \nand pavement design. SPECL staff will undertake about 60 person-months of international \ntraining. With the assistance of the consultants, SPECL will prepare for ADB's concurrence a \nprogram of training activities, their location, and a list of candidates. Findings from the training \nwill be disseminated in Sichuan Province through an appropriate institute. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n45.  The  project  benefits  and  impacts  were  assessed  along  with  the  potential  risks \nassociated with the Project. The integrated benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs and the \nProject will bring net benefits in the project area. \n \nA.  Economic Benefits and Distribution Analysis \n \n46.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project situations. Without the Project, the traffic volume would exceed the capacity of \nthe existing national highway 108, which would become congested, increasing travel time, \nvehicle operating costs (VOCs), and the number of accidents. With the Project, travel time on \nthe road will be reduced because of higher speeds and shorter distance; VOCs will be reduced ", "  15\nbecause of faster and smoother travel on the expressway; and the accident rate will be reduced \nby eliminating congestion, providing safety features, and separating fast- and slow-moving \ntraffic. Similar benefits also accrue to the traffic on the existing road. If local roads are not \nupgraded, people in the remote parts of the project area will have less mobility and the mainly \npoor inhabitants will not be able to participate in the mainstream of economic activity.  \n \n47.  The  economic  costs  of  the  expressway  reflect  the  resource  costs  for  construction, \noperation and maintenance (O&M), and the value of agricultural production from land lost \npermanently. The economic benefits generated by the expressway include (i) savings in VOCs \nas a result of reduced road length and improved traffic conditions, (ii) time savings for road \nusers, (iii) savings from avoided physical damage as a result of fewer accidents, and (iv) \nbenefits to generated traffic. Environmental benefits will come from avoided vehicular emissions \nas a result of the reduced level of congestion on national highway 108. However, these benefits \nwere not included in the economic analysis because an established methodology for their \nvaluation is not available.  \n \n48.  The EIRR for the Project, including the expressway and local roads, is 16.2%, indicating \nthat the Project is economically viable (Appendix 4). Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the \nrobustness of the Project's economic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 10% \nreduction in benefits do not significantly impact the economic viability. The capital cost would \nhave to increase by 85% over the estimate for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The \nbenefit level would have to decrease by 43% to achieve the same effect. In light of previous \nexperience in the PRC's road sector, variations of such magnitude are unlikely. The EIRR was \nalso calculated separately for the expressway and local road components. The EIRR was \n16.1% for the expressway component and 20.3% for the local road component. \n \n49.  The economic analysis of the Project was extended to quantify the direct poverty impact \nby examining the distribution of project net benefits by determining the project effects for various \nbeneficiaries, including road users, local economy, labor, and government. The impact on the \npoor was assessed by quantifying the direct benefits that would accrue to poor people under the \nProject. The proportion of net benefits passed on to poor people, or the poverty impact ratio, \nwas calculated as 24% (Appendix 4). This ratio is higher than the country\u2019s poverty incidence \nand the income share of the poor.  \n \nB.  Financial Benefits \n \n50.  Toll setting is the responsibility of the provincial government. Within Sichuan Province, \napplications  to  set  and  adjust  toll  levels  are  proposed  by  expressway  corporations  for \nconsideration by SPCD and the provincial price bureau and approval by SPG. SPECL will \nundertake a toll analysis before opening the expressway, and each year for 5 years thereafter, to \nconfirm the appropriate level of toll, and will submit the results for ADB\u2019s concurrence. ADB \nprovided TA34 to carry out a toll diversion study and the manual has been distributed to provincial \ncommunications departments. Findings from these studies will help SPECL determine the toll \nlevels for the Project. \n \n                                                 \n34 Toll Diversion Model: Application Manual (September 2000) developed under ADB. 1998. TA to the PRC for \nPreparing the Chongqing-Guizhou Expressway Project. Manila. ", "16  \n51.  The proposed toll rates35 are considered reasonable to attract sufficient traffic to meet \neconomic and financial rate of return criteria. The effects of alternative toll rates on the EIRR \nand financial internal rate of return (FIRR) were assessed. Reduction in the EIRR for the toll \nrates of up to double the base rate are minor, but beyond this point, a more pronounced impact \nis likely, and the EIRR will be below 12%. At this toll rate, the FIRR rises by about 2 percentage \npoints. Based on these findings, the toll rate could be increased if required to ensure SPECL\u2019s \nfinancial viability. In practice, however, this may be difficult because (i) the proposed toll rates \nare already high compared with other expressways in Sichuan Province, and (ii) social concerns \nare considered when toll rates are determined, particularly when expressways pass through \npoor areas. Toll levels will be reviewed annually in relation to operating costs, toll levels on other \ntoll facilities, and affordability. The level and structure of the tolls will be such as to ensure that \nthe expressway\u2019s toll revenue will cover O&M costs, debt servicing, and depreciation in excess \nof debt servicing, and generate a reasonable rate of return on the investment as adjusted for \ninflation from time to time. If an adjustment of the toll levels is required based on this principle, \nSPECL will submit its toll adjustment plans for ADB\u2019s concurrence before finalizing and submitting \nit to SPG for approval. \n \n52.  The financial performance of the project expressway was forecast, taking into account \nthe anticipated traffic, the projected operating costs, and the proposed toll rates. The working \nratio is expected to be below 12% over the project life. The debt service coverage ratio of more \nthan 1.2 is achievable from the second year of full operation. The debt-to-equity ratio will remain \nbelow 60:40 throughout the Project\u2019s life. SPECL, as a corporation independent of the provincial \ngovernment, will be financially autonomous. Projections based on currently available information \nand investment plans show that SPECL will be able to generate sufficient income. The financial \ninternal rate of return for the project expressway is 5.5%, which is greater than the real weighted \naverage cost of capital of 4% (Appendix 4). \n \nC.  Impact on Poverty \n \n53.  The root causes of poverty in the project area are the poor productive conditions and \ndifficult  topography\u2014a  situation  exacerbated  by  general  remoteness  and  inadequate  road \naccess. Although all townships are accessible by vehicle, no mountain township is served by a \npaved road. Roads are mostly rock and earth, narrow, and subject to frequent rock-falls, which \nmake them impassable. Medium-sized trucks are the prime means of road transport. Passenger \nfares are more than double those on good roads. As a consequence, many people walk, for up \nto 7 hours, to get to market, and up to 5 hours to get fuelwood. Horses and donkeys are a vital \nelement of the transportation system in the mountains for heavy loads. Because of the poor \nroads and high cost of transport, the cost of construction materials and fertilizer are also \nconsiderably higher. In some areas, farmers feed their fruit to pigs as the transport cost makes it \nprohibitive to take the fruit to market. Poor access also limits the ability of residents to take \nadvantage of increased employment opportunities in the urban areas, and makes it difficult for \nlocal officials and agricultural extension officers to visit the part of the project area suffering most \nfrom poverty. \n \n54.  The Project will have a substantial beneficial socioeconomic impact on the majority of \nthe population, urban and rural, living in the project area. An initial poverty and social analysis \n                                                 \n35 The opening toll rates per vehicle-km are CNY0.52 for cars, CNY1.00 for light trucks, CNY1.89 for medium-sized \ntrucks, and CNY2.68 for heavy trucks. This will be reviewed every 5 years and adjusted as necessary. These rates \nare slightly higher than currently charged tolls in Sichuan Province but are within a range of tolls applicable for \nsimilar expressways in the region. ", "  17\n(Appendix 3) undertaken during TA fact-finding and a full poverty and social analysis carried out \nduring the TA indicate that farmers and urban residents will be the largest beneficiary groups, \nalthough the majority of the easily quantifiable benefits will accrue to road users, especially \nexpressway users.  Many farmers living in townships located on the local road network will \nincrease their agricultural production through improved access to markets, and lower transport \ncosts for both agricultural produce and agricultural inputs. These farmers will also benefit from \nreduced travel time to markets and for routine activities such as water and fuelwood, much \neasier access to emergency health care, and increased information flows and access to the \noutside world. Rural residents in and on the hillsides overlooking the Anning Valley will also \nbenefit indirectly from improved transport conditions on the existing main roads and the impetus \nto economic growth resulting from a better road network. The construction of the expressway \nwill provide significant benefits, especially to townships along the project alignment, through \nemployment  during  construction  and  the  provision  of  services  to  labor  construction  sites. \nInterchanges  will  provide  opportunities  for  trading  and  service  activities.  The  only  adverse \nconsequences are those arising from loss of land or property because of the land acquisition for \nthe Project. Any resulting adverse effects will be mitigated by compensation payments and \nreplacement houses as per the resettlement plan. \n \n55.  Direct  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  from  the  local  road  component  will  be  more \nsignificant than those accruing from the expressway component. The local road improvements \nwill provide a greater relative improvement in accessibility to poor communities, and will cater \ndirectly to the transportation needs of farmers in general and poor farmers in particular. In \ncontrast, benefits from the expressway component will mostly be longer term and indirect in \nnature, resulting from the general increase in economic activity in the Anning Valley made \npossible by the expressway. The transportation needs of farmers, and especially poor farmers, \nprimarily involve local, as opposed to interurban, roads. \n \nD.  Risks  \n \n56.  The Project was formulated to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and social \nrisks. The main technical risks, which could result in implementation delays and cost overruns, \nare  associated  with  the  tunnel  and  bridge  structures.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  international \nconsultants  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and  construction  methods.  Prequalification  of \ncontractors focuses on their financial and technical capability in handling complex works. During \nconstruction, monitoring and contract management information systems will be set up and \nimplemented, with the assistance of the international consultants, for timely identification of \ntechnical  problems  and  implementation  of  corrective  measures.  Given  the  safety  hazards \nassociated with bridge works, the contractors will be required to strictly enforce working safety \nrules and measures. SPCD has proven experience and has shown satisfactory performance in \nimplementing  internationally  financed  projects.  Appropriate  coordination  and  monitoring \nmechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  to  mitigate  resettlement  risks.  There  is  a  risk  that  the \nopportunities for anticipated development in social services and income generation may not be \naccessible to the poor. This risk is mitigated by the strong commitment of the Government and \nSichuan Province to poverty reduction as part of the Western Region Development Strategy and \nthe monitoring system to ensure that benefits accrue to the poor.    \n \n57.  Economic  performance  in  the  project  influence  area  would  have  to  deteriorate \nsubstantially  for  the  Project  to  lose  economic  viability.  The  financial  risk  associated  with \nconstruction and operation of the expressway will depend on the actual construction costs, \ncommercial  management  and  appropriate  tolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  SPECL  is \nbuilding a commercial business environment for expressway operations, the project expressway ", "18  \nwill receive substantial equity from the central and provincial governments, and an appropriate \ntoll structure will be adopted. For a project generating revenue in domestic currency, a risk is \nrelated to exchange rate changes, and is partly accounted for in the base case calculations. \nSensitivity tests indicate that an adverse exchange rate change of 30% would have only a small \neffect on the FIRR. A 30% one-off adverse change in the exchange rate in the first operating \nyear would also have little impact on the debt service coverage ratio. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n58.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SPCD have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n59.  Counterpart Financing. SPCD and SPECL will obtain, on a timely basis, all funds and \nresources necessary for project implementation. The Government will take, and will cause SPG, \nthrough  SPCD,  to  take  all  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  SPCD  and  SPECL  can \nsuccessfully implement the Project, and operate and manage it after completion. \n \n60.  Construction Quality. SPCD and SPECL will ensure that the Project is constructed in \naccordance with technical standards of the Ministry of Communications for highway engineering \nand with reference to the highway design manual developed under ADB-financed TA for Review \nof Highway Design Standards.36 The international consultant designated as the team leader and \nassistant chief supervision engineer will review and certify variation orders and contractors\u2019 \nmonthly payments, before the chief supervision engineer approves them. \n \n61.  Road  Safety.  SPCD  and  SPECL  will  implement  the  road  safety  signage, \ncommunication, hazard barriers, traffic monitoring, and vehicle weighing; and will cooperate \nclosely with the public security bureau to implement necessary road safety measures. The \npublic security bureau will prepare and implement the provincial road safety guidelines and \naction plans for road safety in Liangshan and Panzhihua prior to opening of the expressway. \nBefore opening the expressway, SPCD in consultation with the public security bureau will \nsubmit a report on the emergency response plan to ADB for review. Recommendations of the \nroad safety audit will be considered prior to the expressway construction and operations. \n \n62.  Tolls. In determining toll level, SPG will take into consideration levels sufficient to satisfy \nthe SPECL\u2019s debt service coverage ratio of minimum 1.2 times from the second year of full \noperation. Six months before the expressway is opened, SPCD through SPECL will seek ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence on the proposed toll structure and levels prior to SPG\u2019s approval. For the first 5 \nyears of operation, SPCD through SPECL will review the toll structure and levels annually, and \nsubmit a report to ADB. SPCD through SPECL will seek ADB\u2019s concurrence on toll levels \nadjustment before SPG approval is sought. \n \n63.  Corporate  Governance.  SPECL  will  implement  the  corporate  development  plan  to \nstrengthen its corporate governance by 31 December 2004. \n \n64.  Financial Ratios. To ensure financial sustainability, SPECL will maintain (i) a debt-to-\nequity ratio of not more than 60:40; (ii) a working ratio (annual O&M cost, but excluding periodic \nmaintenance cost, to revenue) of not more than 12% during expressway operation; and (iii) a \n                                                 \n36 ADB. 1996. TA to the PRC for Review of Highway Design Standards. Manila ", "  19\ndebt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2 during expressway operation from the second \nyear of full operation. \n \n65.  Human Resource Development and Training. SPECL in consultation with SPCD will \nprepare a human resource development plan. Before undertaking international training, SPECL \nwill prepare, for ADB\u2019s concurrence,  (i) a training plan and, separately, a list of nominated \ncandidates,  (ii)  a  program  of  workshops  to  be  delivered  at  SPECL  by  those  trained \ninternationally, and (iii) a list of training equipment and aids required to strengthen SPECL\u2019s \ndomestic training programs. Upon completion of each workshop, SPECL will submit to ADB an \nevaluation of the international training and the workshop. \n \n66.  Private Sector Development. SPCD will enter into a concession framework agreement \nwith SPECL by 30 June 2004. Six months before the opening of the project facilities, SPCD \nthrough SPECL will analyze the feasibility of attracting private sector investment funds for future \nroad sector investment, including private sector participation in O&M of the project expressway, \nand report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n67.  Environment.  SPCD  and  SPECL  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  constructed  and \noperated in accordance with Government\u2019s rules and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects. SPCD and SPECL will implement \nthe mitigation measures and environmental monitoring program set out in the EIA to mitigate \nany adverse environmental impacts arising from the Project.  \n \n68.  Vehicle Emissions. SPECL will cooperate with and assist the Environmental Protection \nBureau of Sichuan in controlling vehicle emissions on the project expressway. Before opening \nthe project expressway, SPECL will submit to ADB the emission regulation limits prescribed by \nthe Government, penalties for their infringement, and the plan for enforcing vehicle emission \ncontrol for the expressway. The Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau will prepare and \nimplement the provincial guidelines for vehicle emissions reduction and the action plans for \nLiangshan and Panzhihua prior to opening of the expressway. \n \n69.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. SPCD and SPECL will ensure that the resettlement \nplan,  including  land  acquisition,  is  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently,  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s Land Administration Law and ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement. SPCD and \nSPECL will ensure that implementation of the resettlement plan is monitored and evaluated by a \nlocal institute and reported to ADB, and that a baseline survey is carried out as required in the \nplan.  \n \n70.  Poverty Reduction. SPECL will cause the contractors to maximize the employment of \nlocal poor persons who meet the job and efficiency requirements for construction of the project \nroads. Such workers will be provided on-the-job training. The Government will cause SPG to \nextend the coverage and quality of public utilities, basic health, and basic education in the \nproject  area  to  enhance  the  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  Poverty  Alleviation  Office,  in \nconsultation  with  SPECL,  will  monitor  the  impacts  on  poverty  with  the  assistance  of  a \ndesignated local institute based on a set of indicators and will submit annual monitoring reports \nto ADB. \n \n71.  Gender and Development. SPCD and SPECL will follow ADB\u2019s policy on gender and \ndevelopment during project implementation, and will take all necessary actions to encourage \nwomen to participate in planning and implementing the Project. SPCD and SPECL will monitor ", "20  \nthe effects on women during project implementation through gender-disaggregated data where \nrelevant in the resettlement plan and the monitoring and evaluation system. \n \n72.  Health Risks. The Department of Health and SPECL, together with the appropriate \nauthorities,  will  ensure  that  contractors  disseminate  information  on  the  risks  of  socially \ntransmitted diseases to those employed during project implementation. The Department of \nHealth, SPCD, and SPECL will also ensure that similar information is disseminated to transport \noperators during operation of the project facilities. \n \n73.  Women and Child Labor. SPECL will include a specific clause in bidding documents \nrequiring that the civil works contractors (i) do not differentiate payment between men and \nwomen for work of equal value, and (ii) do not employ child labor in the construction and \nmaintenance activities. \n \n74.  Axle  Loads. SPCD, through SPECL, will install vehicle axle-weighing equipment at \nselected entry points. SPCD through SPECL will make suitable arrangements for operation of \nsuch equipment. Before opening the project expressway, SPECL will submit to ADB the plan for \noperation of the vehicle weigh stations, including the prescribed axle-load limits and penalties \nfor infringement. \n \n75.  Change in Ownership. If (i) any change in ownership of the project facilities, or (ii) any \nsale, transfer, or assignment of SPCD\u2019s interest in the project expressway is anticipated, the \nGovernment, SPG, and SPECL will consult ADB at least 6 months before the change. The \nGovernment, SPG, and SPECL, will ensure that any proposed change in ownership of the \nproject facilities is carried out in a legal and transparent manner. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n76.  The loan agreement will take effect subject to the following condition: an onlending \nagreement  between  SPG  and  SPECL  will  have  been  executed  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \nVI.

Vehicle Fleet and Traffic.  In 2000, vehicle fleet of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) totaled 15.5 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 46.5 million other motorized vehicles \n(motorcycles and agricultural vehicles). The total number of trucks, cars, and buses increased by \nabout 1.3 million in 2000, with the market share for trucks dropping to 45.0%, down from 66.8% in \n1990. Despite the rapid increase in total vehicles, every 100 persons had only about 1.3 vehicles \n(truck, car, or bus). This figure is low relative to other countries in the Asia and Pacific region.1 Not \nuntil the early 1980s were modern vehicles imported and joint ventures formed with foreign \nautomobile manufacturers to introduce modern technology. Over the next 5 years, plans are to \ninvest up to $7 billion in automotive manufacturing. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade \nOrganization  in  December  2001  should  increase  investment  in  automobile  production.  The \nmodernization of the vehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety, and reduce fuel consumption and \nvehicle emissions. In 2000 there were 438,000 passenger vehicles and 319,000 trucks and \npassenger vehicles in Sichuan, equal to 4.8% of the national fleet. This is lower in proportion to \nboth population and length of road by comparison with the PRC as a whole. For example, in \n2000, Sichuan had about 0.9 vehicles for 100 persons, only two thirds of the national average. \nGrowth in the number of vehicles in Sichuan between 1990 and 2000 was 10.1% per annum, \nslightly lower than the national average of 11.1% per annum. \n \n2.  The privately owned fleet of motor vehicles in the PRC increased more than 20 times \nduring 1985\u20132000, from 0.3 million vehicles to 6.3 million. Trucks accounted for 41% of the total \nprivately owned vehicles; cars and buses, 58%; and other specialized vehicles, 1%. In Sichuan, \nprivately owned motor vehicles in 1999 totaled about 117,800. Given the PRC's rapid economic \ngrowth and low vehicle ownership, both the public and private vehicle fleets are expected to \ncontinue to grow rapidly in the coming years. This will result in substantial increases in the volume \nof road traffic and mounting congestion. The high share of slow-moving traffic, mainly tractors, \nbicycles, and nonmotorized agricultural vehicles, aggravates road congestion, and is a major \ncause of traffic accidents.  \n \n3.  The Road Transport Industry. The provincial communications departments (PCDs) are \nresponsible for regulating the road transport industry by licensing drivers, vehicles, and intercity \nbus services. Road transport tariffs are subject to controls in the range of plus or minus 20% of \nlocally established advisory tariffs. The relaxation of trucking regulations in the 1980s allowed \nprivately owned trucks to haul cargo for state-owned factories and cooperatives. Privately owned \ntrucks absorbed most of the traffic growth in the 1990s with the market share of state-owned \ntransportation  companies  declining.  The  resulting  competition  is  improving  road  transport \nefficiency and the quality of services. ADB supported this process through technical assistance \n(TA).2 The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is encouraging the private sector to augment the \noverall capacity of the road transport industry. The annual passenger handling capacity increased \nfrom 12.0 billion passengers in 1997 to 14.5 billion in 2000. About 900,000 buses were in \noperation in 2000 compared with 764,000 in 1994. The number of bus routes reached about \n85,000 to serve more than 94% of the villages accessible by road. \n \n4.  Road  Administration.  Road  administration  in  the  PRC  is  decentralized.  At  the \nprovincial level, the PCDs are responsible for the highway networks, and plan, budget, and \nfinance road projects. Generally the PCDs are financially independent of the Government, \nexcept with large projects of national significance. MOC provides policy guidance and technical \n                                                 \n1  Figures for other countries are 2.5 for India, 5.0 for Indonesia, 14.3 for Thailand, 59.6 for Australia, and 65.3 for \nJapan. \n2  ADB.  1993.

", "Appendix 2  25\nsupport  to  the  PCDs  through  national  policies,  regulations,  and  design  and  construction \nstandards.  Provincial  planning  commissions  approve  development  plans  and  projects.  The \nPCDs, through their city, prefecture, and county-level units, are responsible for planning and \nadministering the road sector, including constructing and maintaining the road network. Road \nsafety and annual vehicle testing are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Security at the \nnational and local government levels. Inspection of vehicle emissions is the responsibility of \nlocal environmental protection bureaus in conjunction with provincial public security bureaus. \nThe road sector agencies are generally well staffed with trained technical personnel, particularly \nat the central and provincial levels. Human resource development systems provide regular \ntraining for technical staff, operators, and various technicians. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has supported human resource development in sector institutions under loans and TAs. \nADB\u2019s country assistance program evaluation for the PRC concluded that, in the transport \nsector, executing agencies have been making good use of the knowledge transfer, and in-\ncountry and external training opportunities provided under ADB projects. \n \n5.  Road Sector Revenues and Expenditures. Expenditures in highway infrastructure are \nfinanced from dedicated user charges, Government grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and \nforeign loans and investments. Two dedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and the \nvehicle purchase fee, have provided much of the financing for the road sector. During the 9th Five-\nYear Plan (FYP, 1996\u20132000), the road maintenance fee, levied on the revenue of freight and \npassenger transport companies and on the load capacity of private vehicles, provided about 53% \nof the total financing requirements of road investments. Revenues from the vehicle purchase fee, \nlevied  on  the  retail  price  of  vehicles,  financed  about  13%,  mostly  in  poorer  provinces  as \ngovernment policy. MOC provided supplementary financing of about 2% of the requirements to \nconstruct  or  rehabilitate  rural  roads  in  poverty  areas.  Domestic  loans  and  bond  financing, \ngenerally with short maturities, were still relatively low, and accounted for 9% of all highway \ninvestments.  Other  domestic  financing,  including  from  local  governments  and  state-owned \nenterprises, accounted for 12% of the requirements. Foreign loans covered 8% of the investment \nin highway construction, and foreign direct investment the remaining 3%. During the 1980s and \n1990s, the PRC increased its foreign borrowing for infrastructure, mainly from ADB, the Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank. \n \n6.  In  Sichuan,  road  maintenance  fees  and  domestic  borrowings  are  major  financing \nsources for its budget. During the 9th FYP, the road maintenance fee, levied on the revenue of \nfreight  and  passenger  transport  companies  and  on  the  load  capacity  of  private  vehicles, \nprovided about 20% of the total financing requirements of road investments, and the domestic \nborrowings provided about 37%. The provincial road budgets during the 9th FYP increased from \nCNY6,065 million in 1996 to CNY11,220 million in 2000. However, an increasing proportion of \nprovincial road budgets is being used to meet the national priority for expressway and highway \nconstruction. The proportion of funding for new construction of expressways increased from \n64% to 75% in the last 5 years, while the proportion for county and township roads declined \nfrom 11% to 5%. In addition, the proportion of funding for road maintenance decreased from \n17% in 1996 to 13% in 2000. The proposed Project, however, includes not only the construction \nof new expressway but also the upgrading of high-priority local roads, so that the Project will \nhelp ensure that expenditures for expressways and local roads are reasonably balanced during \nthe 10th FYP. According to the forecasted 10th FYP, the proportion of funding for rehabilitation \nand new construction of county and township roads will increase from 5% in 2000 to 20% in \n2005. \n \n7.  Road Engineering and Construction. Road and bridge projects are designed by the \nplanning and design institutes at the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the \ndesigns of expressways, class I highways, and associated structures. In general, the institutes are ", "26  Appendix 2 \nstaffed with experienced, well-qualified personnel. Construction is supervised by personnel from \ncounty, city, and prefecture highway units. The city and county highway bureaus have their own \nconstruction units to carry out minor projects within their administrative districts. Drawing on the \nexperience gained under ADB- and World Bank-financed projects, competitive bidding practices \nwere mandated by the 1999 Tendering and Bidding Law. Many of the larger provincial and urban \nconstruction bureaus are being reorganized into financially independent companies and have \nbeen awarded contracts individually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World \nBank-financed highway projects. \n \n8.  In 1999, MOC implemented a series of measures to enhance quality control in highway \nconstruction and carried out two nationwide quality audits of the construction of national highways \nand  major  trunk  roads.  As  required  by  MOC,  all  PCDs,  including  the  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications Department (SPCD), have been inspecting the quality of their ongoing road \nconstruction works from 1999. Taking into account findings of the audits, MOC will adopt more \nstringent regulations to ensure that roads are constructed to national standards. Investment will be \nincreased in regions, including Sichuan Province, that have completed good quality roads that are \nwell-managed and well-maintained. Investment will be decreased in regions with projects of \nsubstandard quality due to inappropriate technical design or poor implementation. \n \n9.  Policy Dialogue. ADB has been actively undertaking policy dialogue on the PRC road \nsector since 1991. The principal issues addressed include the poverty impact of road projects, \nhighway  design  standards  and  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing \npolicies, commercialization and corporatization, and nongovernment financial resources. The \nstatus and achievements to date are summarized in the Road Sector Policy Reform Plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  27\nROAD SECTOR POLICY REFORM PLAN \n \n  Initiative    Current Status  Actions  Target Date \n       \n1.

An initial poverty and social analysis was undertaken during technical assistance fact-\nfinding, identifying key poverty and social issues to be analysed during project preparation. Based \non its findings, a poverty and social analysis (Table A3.1) was carried out to ensure that the Project \nmeet ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements for involuntary and indigenous peoples. \n \n2.  In 1994, Sichuan Province drew up the provincial poverty reduction plan and social strategy \nin line with the national poverty reduction plan. Physical achievements of the provincial action plan \nincluded improved water supply (10 million people), land development (380,000 hectares [ha]), \nprovision of irrigation (167,000 ha), afforestation and grassland development (500,000 ha), road \nconstruction (38,000 kilometers [km]), and new housing separating minority people from their \nlivestock (250,000 households). Vehicular access to most townships is now possible and the great \nmajority of villages receive electricity. Some voluntary resettlement schemes have been carried out \nby relocating high mountain communities to areas with greater production potential. \n \nA.  The Project Area \n \n3.  The project area is centered on the Anning River valley in the southwest of Sichuan. The \nproject area is diverse in terms of climate, topography, ecology, economy, and ethnic minorities. It \nincludes Dechang, Miyi, and Yanbian counties; the urban district of Panzhihua; and small parts of \nHuili, Renhe, and Xichang counties. About 1.2 million people live in the project area. Over 80% of \nthe rural population live in Dechang, Miyi, and Yanbian counties. The economy of the project area \nhas grown at an average annual rate of 10% since 1990. The soil is fertile and climactic conditions \nin  the  valleys  are  favorable.  Although  agriculture  contributes  16%  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP), almost 60% of the total labor force in the project area work in agriculture. Major agricultural \nproducts include grain and cash crops such as sugar, fruit, meat production, and tobacco, much of \nwhich is sold in other parts of the country. In the mountainous areas, where irrigation is limited, \ncash cropping is limited and grain yields are lower.   \n \n4.  Minority groups account for about 12% of the population in the project area, principally the \nYi minority (90%), who mostly live in poor mountainous villages. Twenty-four of the 101 townships \nin the project area have a minority population exceeding 75%. Relative to the poor Han, poor \nminority families tend to have a lower level of cultivation expertise, experience a higher level of \nabsolute poverty, have larger families, are in poorer health, especially women and children, and \nhave lower school attendance and adult literacy rates. \n \n5.  Despite declines in poverty in the project area, the poverty incidence is still high. Out of a \ntotal rural population of 611,900, 194,190 (32%) have annual incomes of less than CNY1,000 \ncompared with 12% nationally. Of the 544 rural villages in the project area, 282 are classified as \npoor. Around 40% of the total rural population live in poor villages. The incidence of poverty is \nunevenly distributed in the project area: under 20% in the Anning valley, around 80% in the \nmountainous areas. Yanbian is the poorest county\u201353% of the rural poor population are classified \nas poor compared with 22% in Renhe and Xichang counties.  \n \n6.  During  the  participatory  rural  appraisal  undertaken  as  part  of  the  project  processing \nactivities, several types of information were collected for each village and township: the rural \npopulation and average income per capita (Table A3.2), road access, and access to basic facilities \nsuch power, telephone, water, health, and education (Table A3.3). \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nTable A3.1: Summary Poverty and Social Analysis \n \nA.

The root causes of poverty in the project area (particularly in the mountainous areas) are \nthe  poor  productive  conditions  and  difficult  topography\u2014a  situation  exacerbated  by  general \nremoteness and inadequate road access. Although all townships are accessible by vehicle, no \nmountain township is served by a paved road. Roads are mostly rock and earth, narrow, and \nsubject to frequent rockfalls, which make them impassable. Few are accessible by a normal car, \npickup, or minibus; the risk of accidents is high in bad weather. Medium-sized trucks are the prime \nmeans  of  vehicular  transport.  Passenger  fares  are  more  than  double  those  on  good  roads\u2013 \nCNY0.35 compared with CNY0.15 per km. Consequently, many people walk, for up to 7 hours to \nget to market, and up to 5 hours to get fuelwood. Horses and donkeys are an important element of \nthe transportation system in the mountains for heavy loads; they are rarely ridden. The cost of \nconstruction materials and fertilizer are considerably higher in areas with poor road access. In \nsome areas, farmers feed their fruit to pigs as they cannot market it. Poor access also limits the \nability of residents to take advantage of increased employment opportunities in the urban areas \nand makes it difficult for local officials and agricultural extension officers to visit the poorest areas. \n \n8.  Urban incomes in the project area are on average, higher than in the province as a whole. \nOne reason is that the Pangang, a state-owned enterprise providing over 25% of total urban \nemployment in the project area, pays above average salaries as well as numerous ancillary \nbenefits. Of the total urban population in the project area, 10.6% have annual incomes of less than \nCNY3,000, compared with around 10% of a national average for urban. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n9.  Various nongovernment organizations (NGOs) contribute to poverty reduction in Sichuan, \nincluding  the  Sichuan  Foundation  for  Aiding  Poverty-Stricken  Areas,  Development  of  Rural \nSichuan, Ford Foundation of the United States, Aierbert Foundation of Germany, and Kaier of \nJapan. The Sichuan Foundation is a prominent NGO in Sichuan (the local office of the China \nFoundation for Poverty Alleviation). One of their main priorities is environmental protection in poor \nareas, especially along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The foundation has helped the Yi \nminority in Liangshan in renovating houses and moving from felling trees to reclaiming wasteland \nso that farmers can be engaged in planting and livestock. \n \nB.  Social and Poverty-Related Project Features \n \n10.  To strengthen the poverty reduction impact of the Project, three main features received \nparticular attention: (i) the expressway was designed with attention to social and poverty issues; (ii) \nthe local road component was selected mainly using poverty criteria; and (iii) the Project will \nmaximize the use of poor people for the unskilled labor jobs created during project construction. \n \n11.  The  selected  alignments  of  the  project  road  are  the  least  disruptive  of  alternative \nalignments. The design incorporates the following features: (i) bypassing heavily populated areas \nas evidenced by the relatively small number of households to be relocated, (ii) constructing 35 \nunderpasses in urban and rural locations for people and animals, and (iii) installing 311 culverts to \naccommodate surface runoff and to augment water flow to irrigation canals. \n \n12.  The Project, with a local road component of 558 km (Table A3.4) improving access to poor \nand minority areas, will provide the poor rural population the needed transport link to new and \nlarger markets. The existing county, township, and village roads in the project area were mapped \nduring project preparation to identify the most effective local road component to be included in the \nProject. The local road component was designed using the following criteria: (i) connecting poverty \ntownships to the expressway\u2019s interchanges, (ii) connecting poverty townships to each other, and \n(iii) impact on economic and social development of the local areas. Experience has shown that to \nraise communities and households above the poverty level, alternative sources of incomes in \naddition to farming are required. An important factor in providing such off-farm income sources is \nall-weather access roads for migrant labor, village enterprises, or small family businesses.  \n \n13.  To enhance the direct impact of the Project on poverty reduction, priority in unskilled labor \njobs will be given to poor people. The Sichuan Panxi Expressway Company Limited (SPECL) will \nensure through contractors to maximize the employment of local poor persons who meet the job \nand efficiency requirements for construction of the project roads. Such workers will be given on-\nthe-job training. The Sichuan Provincial Government will extend the coverage and quality of public \nutilities, basic health, and basic education in the project area to enhance the poverty reduction \nimpacts. SPECL will monitor the impacts on poverty with the assistance of a designated local \ninstitute and will submit annual monitoring reports to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n14.  The Project will have a substantial beneficial socioeconomic impact on the majority of the \npopulation, urban and rural, of the project area in general, and the poor population in particular. \nFarmers and urban residents will be the largest beneficiary groups.  Farmers will benefit through \nincreases in agricultural output arising from improved access to markets, lower transport and travel \ncosts, reduced travel times for routine activities (going to market, carrying water and fuel wood), \neasier access to emergency health care, increased interaction with the outside world, more visits \nfrom local officials involved in development  activities  and  increased  nonagricultural  employment   \n ", "Appendix 3  33\n \n     \nTable A3.4: Local Road Component \n \nRoad  Start  Finish  Length  Population  Other Townships  Population/ \n(km)  Served  Served  km \nX1  A'Ci  Qiaodi  5      5,000    1,000 \nD1  Dechang  Ma'an  35    18,050  Tielu,  Rehe,  Dawan,    520 \nDashan, Dezhou \nD2  Ma'an-Dechang road  Tielu  24      5,400       230 \nD3  Ma'an  Yalong river  17      4,750  Rehe     280 \nD4  Ma'an-Dechang road  Dashan  30      5,100  Dawan     170 \nD5  Yalong River  Rehe  17      4,750       280 \nD6  Ci Da  Daliucao  21      2,100       100 \nD7  G108  Yinlu  13      2,800       220 \nD8  Linsuo  Nanshan  7      5,000  Liusuo (part)     710 \nD9  Laonian  Cangtian  15      7,100       470 \nH1  Xiacun  Tiechang  6    12,550  Liumin, Liuhaa, Sandi 2,090 \nH2  Tiechang  Liumin  10      7,550  Liuhaa, Sandi     760 \nH3  Liumin  Liuhua  15      3,800       250 \nH4  Liumin  Sandi  17      1,650       100 \nM1  Puwei  Nanba  11    10,100  Shengli, Lianghe     920 \nM2  Nanba  Yalong river  15      2,800  Shengli     190 \nM3  Yalong river  Shengli  19      2,800       150 \nM4  Nanba  Lianhe  12      2,800       230 \nM5  Miyi-Puwei road  Yunfeng  15      6,900  Malong     460 \nM6  Yunfeng  Malong  28      4,200       150 \nM7  Malong  S214  36      7,500  Fangtian     210 \nM8  Pingshan  Xin shan  15      4,300  Pingshan (part)     290 \nY1  Yumen-Ertan road  Longshen  25      5,400  Longsheng     150 \nY2  Longsheng spur  Linhai  20      3,200       400 \nY3  Linhai  Gonghe  33      5,300  Linhai     160 \nY4  Gong He  Yalong river  13      9,000  Taitien, Linhai     690 \nY5  Gonghe  Tai tian  16      3,700       230 \nY6  Hongguo  Hongming  9      1,500       170 \nY7  Hongguo  Huajiaoqing  14      1,700       120 \nY8  Hongguo  Wuben  31    13,900  Hongni     450 \nY9  Hongge  Xinjiu  14    17,000  Hongge (part)  1,210 \n  Total    558  187,700  (average)     336 \n  Source: ADB. 2000.

Urban residents will benefit from additional economic growth resulting from a more \nefficient and higher capacity transport network.

The  only  significant  disbenefits  are  those  arising  from  loss  of  land  and/or \nproperty.

The Project is expected to generate a sustainable poverty reduction impact in both the long \nand short term. The short-term improvements will come primarily as a result of the local road \nimprovements, while the impact of the expressway will be mainly felt in the longer term. The \nnumber of poor beneficiaries will be around 244,000, of which almost 100,000 will benefit from the \nlocal roads component (Table A3.5).

About 60% of the minorities in the project area (52,000) are expected to benefit from the \nproject. The minorities will benefit particularly from the local road improvements as minorities \naccount for over 40% of the beneficiaries from this component. The resettlement impact on the \nminority households, who live in a substantial number of villages mostly along the feeder roads, will \nbe small. Compensation and other measures included in the Resettlement Plan will ensure that the \nliving standards of these households are maintained. No adverse impacts are anticipated from the \nlocal road component. Positive discrimination toward minorities will continue as exemplified by \nnational fiscal and development policies, given the explicit targeting of this group in the new \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy.  On  the  basis  of  this  analysis,  a  minority  peoples\u2019 ", "Appendix 3  35\n \n     \ndevelopment plan is not required for this Project, given that the minorities in the project area will \nnot be adversely affected and ongoing development programs will target this group while ensuring \nthat their cultural identify is maintained.

The impact of the Project will be gender neutral\u2014women will benefit as much as men, and \nfew will experience adverse impacts. In one respect, women, and especially minority women, are \nexpected to benefit more than men. The division of labor in minority areas is more marked than in \nHan areas. Women perform a large proportion of farming activities. In addition, they frequently \nundertake the marketing of the small surplus produce produced by the family. They also have the \nprime responsibility for fetching water and fuelwood. All these tasks require much walking with \nheavy loads, often accompanied by young children. Reduced travel costs, greater availability of \ntransport, and improved road surfaces will all lead to a decrease in the burden of these daily \nactivities. In addition, improved transport will result in better access to health clinics in an area \nwhere gynecological problems are common. \n \nD.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n18.  The immediate socioeconomic effects will start to be monitored during the construction \nphase. Construction on several locations along the route will begin simultaneously under different \ncontractors.  Given  the  number  of  contractors  involved,  the  direct  short-term  effects  will  be \nmonitored semiannually. Any favorable practices or policies by one of them will be used as a \nmodel for the others. Among the indicators to be collected for short-term effects are (i) labor force \nemployed on expressway construction, (ii) number of unskilled laborers, (iii) percentage of poor \nlaborers in the labor force, (iv) percentage of local laborers in the labor force, (v) percentage of \nwomen in the total labor force, and (vi) wage level of laborers on the local road component. \nPoverty  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  independently  as  part  of  the  project  performance \nmanagement system with the help of the consultants and a local institute. Monitoring will involve a \nbaseline survey at the start of construction and updates as stated in the project performance \nmonitoring system schedule. The baseline data will be collected from a sample of the affected \nbeneficiaries and a control group before construction starts. Consultants and an institute will \nconduct surveys as necessary. ", "36  Appendix 4 \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n \n1.  Project Costs and Benefits \n \n1.  The Project comprises the expressway that traverses the southern part of Sichuan \nProvince and local roads connected to the expressway through the road network system. The \nProject will be implemented in about 5 years, and economic analysis covers the following 20 \nyears of full operation.  Without the Project, traffic will use the existing road network, which will \nsoon be congested and expensive to maintain because of the rapidly increasing traffic. Some \ntravel may not take place because of the congestion. With the Project, congestion on the \nexisting roads will be reduced, and traffic on the expressway and the existing roads will benefit \nfrom faster, cheaper, and safer travel. Some additional trips will be generated. \n \n2.  Local  roads  in  six  counties  will  be  improved  concurrently  with  the  expressway \ncomponent. The costs of this component include capital costs and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) costs. The estimated benefits are reduced vehicle operating costs (VOCs), travel time \nsavings  for  freight  and  passengers,  reduced  accidents,  and  additional  economic  activities \ngenerated from improved accessibility of the project area. \n \n2.  Valuation of Costs and Benefits \n \n3.  General  Parameters.  Economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  constant  2002 \neconomic prices. The prices are expressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire with a \nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.08 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price is used to \nplace an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, while skilled labor is not shadow \npriced since there is no surplus of skilled workers.  A shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) of 0.67 \nwas used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor as 70% of \nemployees on highway construction projects are unskilled. \n   \n4.  Costs. The capital costs and physical contingencies for the Project are revalued at \neconomic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment, \nnontradable  materials,  labor,  and  land.  The  project  equipment  is  generally  tax  exempt.  A \ncomposite conversion factor of 0.964 was used. \n \n5.  Traffic Forecasts. During the feasibility study prepared by the provincial design institute, \ntwo types of traffic surveys were carried out for traffic analysis, pavement design, and economic \nand financial evaluation: (i) manual classified counts, which provided base data for calculating the \nbase year average annual daily traffic (AADT) in medium truck equivalents (MTE); and (ii) origin-\ndestination surveys to obtain information about traffic movement. The traffic surveys undertaken \non 12 April 2000 were verified by the technical assistance consultants in 2001, at 15 key locations \nalong national highway 108 and provincial highway 214. The manual traffic surveys involved 12- \nto 24-hour counts that lasted for 7 days, and classified traffic into six vehicle categories (car, bus, \nsmall truck, medium truck, large truck, and tractor-trailer). The surveys collected data on the \nnumber of vehicles by type, trip distribution, type and weight of the freight loaded on vehicles, \nnumber of passengers, and transport capacity of vehicles. The result of the traffic forecasts is \ngiven in Table A4.1 and a methodology and assumptions used are detailed in Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  37\nTable A4.1: Average Annual Daily Traffic (medium truck equivalents) \n \n      Growth    Growth \nExpressway Section  2008  2018  Rate  2028  Rate \nXichang-Dechang       4,161       9,139  8.2%  16,179  5.9% \nDechang-Guabang       6,240  11,403  6.2%  20,526  6.1% \nGuabang-Miyi       4,018       9,289  8.7%  17,360  6.5% \nMiyi-Yakou       7,214  13,534  6.5%  21,866  4.9% \nYakou-Xinjiu       6,921  13,073  6.6%  21,649  5.2% \nXinjiu-Jinjiang  10,896  17,985  5.1%  28,068  4.6% \nWeighted Average       6,281  11,874  6.6%  20,389  5.6% \n             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n6.  Benefits. The main source of economic benefits of new or improved roads is a reduction \nin VOCs. VOCs vary by vehicle type (car, bus, truck), road characteristics (pavement width and \nroughness, and horizontal and vertical alignment). The economic costs of the vehicles are \nderived from international prices, with a quality adjustment for domestically produced vehicles. \nDomestically produced trucks and buses are valued at 75% of internationally traded trucks and \nbuses,  and  cars  at  90%  of  the  internationally  traded  cars.  Parts,  fuel,  and  oil  were  also \ncalculated based on current international prices. The benefits from VOC savings, which will \ninitially accrue to vehicle owners and operators, will in the long term be passed on to users of \ntransport services through reduced transport rates and fares, given the increasingly competitive \nnature of the road transport industry in the project area. \n \n7.  The benefits from a reduction in number and severity of accidents constitute an important \npart of economic benefits. Accident reductions were estimated based on the findings of a study \non  accidents  carried  out  by  the  Highway  Planning  and  Design  Institute  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications. Although the economic cost of accidents is higher on the expressway than on \nthe existing roads, with the Project the number of accidents per vehicle-kilometer in the project \ncorridor  will  be  reduced  substantially,  resulting  in  net  cost  savings  derived  from  avoided \naccident costs. The reduction in lives lost was not quantified in the analysis.  \n \n8.  Travel time savings will be enjoyed by traffic both on the project expressway and the \nexisting roads.  VOCs embody the value of the time saved by vehicle drivers and crews, but not \nthe value of time saved by passengers. The value of time saved by passengers traveling in work \ntime was calculated from that person\u2019s wage rate. For people traveling in leisure time, the \npreferred method of valuation is willingness-to-pay for time saved. However, in the absence of \nlocal information on willingness-to-pay, this study bases its choice of values on annual income. \nThe value of time for work or business trips is assumed to be related more to urban incomes for \ncars, and more to average regional incomes for buses. Nonwork trips were given no value. The \nvalue of passenger travel time will increase as income rises. The economic model increases the \nvalue of personal travel time at 4% per annum. \n \n9.  For the 558 km local road component, providing access for mountain communities that \nare  transport-disadvantaged  and  poor,  the  benefits  are  computed  by  identifying  producer \nsurplus and consumer surplus. The producer surplus benefit is a consequence of reducing the \ncost of transport to markets. Producer surplus comes mainly from farming, and is the value of \nthe additional production less production costs. Increased producer surplus eventually shows up \nas  increased  household  income.  In  the  mountains,  income  is  limited  by  access  and  land \nproductivity. Improving access in the mountains will bridge part of the income gap between the \nmountains and the valleys. This income increase is tallied as a producer surplus benefit. The \nproducer surplus benefit is based on a 15% bridging of the income gap, which would realistically ", "38  Appendix 4 \nbe  achievable. 1  Consumer  surplus  from  access  improvements  is  usually  estimated  by \nforecasting generated traffic. Consumer surplus is therefore estimated based on forecasted \npassenger traffic increase that amounts, on most of these local roads, to between 10 and 30 \nvehicles a day. 2 The road improvements will reduce VOCs and raise travel speeds from around \n20 km/h to around 40 km/h. \n \n10.  Results and Conclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project, \nincluding the expressway component and local road component, is 16.2% (Table A4.2). The \nEIRR for the expressway component alone is 16.1% and that for the local road component, \n20.3%. VOC savings are the major economic benefit (78%), followed by travel time savings \n(14%), accident cost savings (5%), and local road component (2%). \n  \n11.  The  EIRR  was  calculated  separately  for  the  local  roads.  The  Project  includes  31 \nsections of local roads that carry mainly local traffic including motorized traffic, such as local bus \nservice. With all of the local roads connected to the trunk highway system through the road \nnetwork, improvement of the local roads is expected to stimulate the rural economy in the \nproject area. The costs of improvement vary, depending on the type of work required. Economic \nbenefits  for  motorized  traffic  are  reductions  in  VOCs  and  time,  and  generated  economic \nactivities as a result of improved access.  An EIRR of 16.2% is relatively low compared with \nother recent projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) of a similar type. This is mainly \ndue to the high construction unit cost and low traffic.   \n \n12.  Sensitivity analysis tested six scenarios to assess the robustness of the results of the \neconomic analysis (Table A4.3). The capital cost would have to be more than 85% higher than \nestimated in every case for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the past \nexperience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the PRC road sector, this switching value \nis unlikely to occur. ADB-financed road projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost \noverruns, and the contract prices tend to be lower than estimated because the contracting \nprocess is becoming increasingly competitive. The benefits level would have to decrease more \nthan 43% to make the Project economically nonviable. A 2-year delay in completion causes the \nnet present value to decrease by 62%. A 20% reduction of the major factors determining \neconomic benefits\u2014VOC savings, growth rate of normal traffic, and traffic generation rate\u2014 \ndoes not affect the economic viability of the Project. \n \n13.  The economic analysis of the Project was extended to quantify the direct poverty impact \nby examining distribution of project net benefits by determining the project effects for various \nbeneficiaries,  including  road  users,  expressway  company,  local  economy,  labor,  and \ngovernment. The impact on the poor was assessed by quantifying the direct benefits that would \naccrue to poor people under the Project. The proportion of net benefits passed on to poor \npeople, or the poverty impact ratio, was calculated as 24% (Table A4.4). This ratio is higher \nthan the country\u2019s poverty incidence and the income share of the poor.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  To achieve this, per household income needs to increase by CNY1,000 per year. CNY1,000 can be earned from 50 \ndays of unskilled labor at CNY20/day. One mu (667 square meters) of fruit trees produces a profit of at least \nCNY1,000/year. Livestock projects in the area, promoting free-range grazing of cattle and goats, are generating \naverage net incomes of about CNY500/year and animal. Pigs earn a net CNY100 to CNY400 each. \n2  The estimate is likely to be less than the true value since the increase in passenger traffic is unlikely to reflect the \nfull benefit of increased personal mobility. ", "Appendix 4  39\nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n14.  General. Proforma financial statements including income statement, cash flows, and \nbalance sheet for the project expressway are based on the following assumptions and were \nprepared for 26 years from 2002 to 2027.  All projections are in nominal (inflation adjusted) \nterms. Throughout the project life, annual inflation rates are assumed to be 2.4%.  \n \n15.  Financial  Statements.  The  financial  projections  are  based  on  the  following \nassumptions:  \n \n(i)  Business tax is assessed at 5.75% on the gross operating revenues. \n \n(ii)  Corporate tax is assessed at 33% of net profit per year.  \n \n(iii)  Based  on  the  toll  rates3 and  the  forecast  traffic  mix,  the  weighted  average \nexpressway toll rate is assumed to be CNY1.38 per MTE-km in the opening year \n(2007). The toll rate is assumed to increase in real terms every 5 years.  \n \n(iv)  The depreciation is based on the economic life of project components.  \n \n(v)  Total operation and maintenance costs are CNY287.3 million in 2008 and are \nescalated at an average rate of 5% per annum, based on a staff of 317 people \nemployed at toll stations, on maintenance teams, and at administrative offices.  \nAnnual salaries and benefits amount to an average 2002 cost of CNY15,000 per \nemployee, and the total payroll is CNY14.5 million. Maintenance expenses are \nestimated to be CNY27 million annually. Operation and maintenance costs are \nassumed to increase in line with traffic growth and domestic inflation.  \n \n(vi)  After 10 years of full operation, the expressway will need to be repaved.  The \nrepaving cost of CNY60 million in the years 2018\u20132020 was adjusted by a price \nescalation factor of 2.4%. \n \n16.  Conclusions  of  financial  statements  are  summarized  as  follows:  (i)  The  projected \nfinancial  statements  indicate  that  the  expected  revenues  under  the  base  assumptions  are \nsufficient to cover operating costs, business tax, debt repayments on the ADB loan and the \ndomestic loan, and reasonable profits from the expressway operation (Table A4.5); and (ii) the \ndebt-to-equity ratio, which decreases steadily from 50:50 in the first year of full operation, \nindicates a sound financial condition for the expressway under the proposed financing plan and \ntoll  structure.  The  debt  service  coverage  ratio  reaches  1.2  during  the  second  year  of  full \noperation.  \n \n17.  Financial  Evaluation.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  project \nexpressway is based on estimated incremental revenues and costs resulting from the operation \nof the expressway.  The assumptions in calculating the FIRR are as follows:  \n \n(i)  The cash flows and financing plan are in real 2002 prices, covering 25 years \ncomprising 4.75 years of construction and 20 years of full operation.  \n                                                 \n3 The opening toll rates per vehicle-km are CNY0.52 for cars, CNY1.00 for light trucks, CNY1.89 for medium trucks, \nand CNY2.68 for heavy trucks.  ", "40  Appendix 4 \n(ii)  The FIRR was calculated after corporate tax, which is expected to be payable in \nthe sixth year of full operation. \n \n(iii)  Capital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the \nconstruction  and  equipment  of  the  project  expressway  as  well  as  periodic \nmaintenance  costs,  but  price  contingency  provisions  and  interest  during \nconstruction are excluded. \n \n(iv)  Operation and maintenance costs include all incremental costs in operating the \nproject expressway, but exclude depreciation provisions. \n \n(v)  Major  maintenance  (periodic  maintenance  such  as  pavement  resurfacing)  is \nassumed to take place in years 11\u201313 of operation, at a cost of CNY60 million. \n \n(vi)  Projected annual operating revenues are estimated in real terms based on the \ndiscounted weighted-average toll rate and the traffic forecast.     \n \n18.  The  results  of  the  financial  evaluation  show  an  FIRR  in  real  terms  of  5.5%  after \ncorporate income tax (Table A4.6). This is higher than the 4.0% real weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC).  Moreover, the financial net present value at the WACC is CNY1,354 million.  \nSensitivity of the FIRR was tested under several scenarios on key parameters and combinations \nof parameters that determine costs and revenues. As shown in Table A4.6, the FIRR remains \nabove the WACC even under the worst scenario. When the capital cost increases by 10%, the \nFIRR decreases to 4.1%.  Increases in operating costs and traffic volume were found to have \nmarginal effects on the FIRR. \n ", "   Appendix 4          41\nTable A4.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return of the Project\n(Constant 2002 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million)\nCosts Benefits\nOperation Local\nand VOC Time Accident Generated Road Net\nYear Capital Maintenance Total Savings Savings Savings Traffic Component Total Benefit\n2003 672 672 (672)\n2004 1,684 1,684 (1,684)\n2005 2,024 2,024 (2,024)\n2006 1,439 1,439 (1,439)\n2007 1,099 6 1,105 102         10       11 123 (982)\n2008 23 23 503         52       55           27 40 676 659\n2009 24 24 572         61       60           31 41 765 748\n2010 24 24 649         73       65           35 41 864 847\n2011 25 25 737         86       72           40 41 976 960\n2012 25 25 836       101       78           46 42 1,104 1,088\n2013 26 26 948       120       86           53 42 1,249 1,232\n2014 27 27 1,074       141       94           61 43 1,413 1,397\n2015 27 27 1,215       167 103           69 43 1,598 1,582\n2016 28 28 1,374       196 112           80 44 1,806 1,791\n2017 29 29 1,554       231 123           91 44 2,044 2,028\n2018 52 29 81 1,755       272 135 104 45 2,311 2,286\n2019 30 30 1,987       323 146 121 45 2,622 2,649\n2020 31 31 2,246       383 158 140 46 2,973 3,001\n2021 32 32 2,534       453 170 163 46 3,366 3,395\n2022 32 32 2,853       535 184 189 46 3,807 3,837\n2023 33 33 3,209       630 199 219 47 4,304 4,335\n2024 34 34 3,604       741 216 254 47 4,861 4,893\n2025 35 35 4,043       870 233 294 48 5,488 5,521\n2026 36 36 4,528 1,021 252 341 48 6,190 6,224\n2027 (3,459) 36 (3,423) 5,065 1,196 273 395 49 6,978 10,401\n  Economic Net Present Value at 12% = 2,844\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return = 16.2%\nVOC = vehicle operating cost.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\nTable A4.3: Sensitivity Analysis\nEconomic Net Switching\nChange EIRR Present Value Sensitivity Valueb\nScenario (%) (%)    (CNY million) Indicatora (%)\n      Base Case 16.2% 2,844\n1.

Road Safety \n \n  1.  Traffic and Road Design Standards \n \n1.  Safety is one of the major factors that should be taken into consideration in conjunction with \nothers such as mobility, economy, and environmental impact, in order to achieve balanced design \nstandards.1 The geometric design of the expressway should be chosen carefully to ensure that \nspeed limits are chosen to suit the geometric design rather than the design speed. The signs, \nmarking, interchange structure, and crash barriers must be selected adequately. The service/rest \nareas, if they are close to significant crossroads and towns, should also be used as long distance \nbus stops to provide convenient services for the passengers. Monitoring of overloaded vehicles will \nhelp reduce traffic accident risk, pavement damage and maintenance cost. Tunnel safety should \nbe incorporated as an integral design component. Road safety audits will be undertaken during the \ndesign and construction. \n \n  2.  Organizational Structure \n \n2.  The  two  organizations  concerned  with  road  safety  and  enforcement  on  the  existing \nexpressways in Sichuan are the Expressway Subdivision of the Traffic Police of the Sichuan Public \nSecurity  Bureau  (SPSB)  and  the  Enforcement  and  Emergency  Division  of  the  Expressway \nCompanies. Sichuan\u2019s Road Safety Council investigates all types of accidents and produces draft \nprovincial  codes  and  standards  for  accident  prevention.  While  establishing  the  council  is  a \nsignificant step, the authority of this council needs to be enhanced to play a more proactive role in \ncoordinating road safety across the province.   \n \n3.  Interdepartmental Coordination and Action Plan  \n \n3.  Coordination. An interdepartmental framework is needed to enhance road safety in the \nprovince. While the Sichuan Provincial Communications Department (SPCD) will concentrate on \nthe engineering, road safety audit, blackspot, and operation issues of the expressway, involvement \nof the SPSB is essential. SPCD will establish a working relationship strategy with SPSB to enforce \nsafer and better expressway operations. The strategy will seek to promote innovative ways to \nimprove road by following a broad-based approach (i) institutional strengthening: strengthen the \nprovincial  road  safety  council  by  establishing  interdepartmental  executive  group;  develop \ncomprehensive  action  programs,  technical  studies,  and  modalities  for  greater  leadership  and \nawareness; improve the policy and regulatory framework; and ensure effective monitoring; (ii) \ncapacity building and human resources development: set up an effective and uniform database, \nupgrade skills and knowledge, and provide options for institutionalizing road safety research; (iii) \nprovincial  cooperation:  develop  potential  common  projects  and  activities,  conduct  regional \nworkshops, foster knowledge and dissemination of best practice, strengthen the linkage with the \nnational program, and set road safety targets and time frame; and (iv) create effective coordination \napproach through government and nongovernment organizations, private sector, and community \ngroups. This will be achieved through (i) computerized accident and enforcement reporting and \nmonitoring system, (iii) development of a strategy framework and performance indicators, (iv) staff \ntraining, and (v) strengthening the role of the province road safety council, e.g., establishing an \nexecutive management group comprising directors of SPSB, SPCD, and Municipal Commission, to \nidentify  the  role  of  each  stakeholder,  coordinate  the  interdepartmental  road  safety  programs, \noptimize the use of resources, manage road safety budget, promote road safety awareness, define \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1996.

", "Appendix 6  49\nperformance indicators, disseminate data, and endorse yearly action plans and strategy across the \nprovince. \n \n4.  Action Plans. An action plan is required to promote an efficient road safety strategy in the \nprovince,  and  for  the  expressway.  An  integrated  approach  may  be  adopted  to  facilitate \nimplementation of the action plan by involving SPCD and SPSB. Insurance companies, the private \nsector, and NGO groups can also be involved. This will result in (i) reduction of accidents; (ii) \nreduced demand for emergency and hospital services; and (iii) improved productivity. Formulation \nof  a  better  fine  system  and  other  measures  will  generate  revenues  to  support  the  program. \nModification of the vehicle-testing center will also provide some funds to support the proposed \nprogram. Implementation of the program will fulfil requirements of current Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and Government initiatives.2  \n \n5.  A  road  safety  specialist  in  safety  strategy  development,  enforcement  management, \nprevention measures, socioeconomic cost, and critical issues of successful road safety programs is \nrequired for 2 person-months. The specialist will (i) develop general provincial road safety guidelines \ncovering all key issues; and (ii) develop an action plan and procedures in the project area, e.g., \nLiangshan  and  Panzhihua.  Coordination  between  SPCD  and  SPSB  is  important  to  facilitate \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  the  action  plan.  The  existing  highway  patrol  team  will  be \nexpanded and strengthened through capacity development efforts to provide traffic policing services \nfor the project expressway. SPSB will implement the action plan, provide the necessary services, and \nassign senior officials to ensure smooth implementation and coordination with all parties. \n \nB.  Vehicle Emissions  \n \n1.  Background \n \n6.  Motor vehicle emissions are a significant contributor to air pollution problem. With rapid \ngrowth  in  the  population  and  vehicle  ownership,  and  slow  action  by  authorities,  air  pollution \nconditions will deteriorate if no mitigation measures are taken. At present Chengdu ranks among \nthe 10 most polluted cities in the country.  \n \n7.  Fragmentation  of  responsibility,  lack  of  interdepartmental  coordination,  together  with \ninadequate base data and monitoring system prevent the formulation of any specific targets for \nreducing key pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and non-\nmethane hydrocarbons. Given these conditions, SPCD and related bodies should proceed with \nplanning a vehicle emission action plan. They should cooperatively (i) undertake a pilot motor \nvehicle emission inspection and maintenance program in the province, laying out the targets, the \norganization,  and  the  budget  with  a  time-bound  implementation  timetable;  (ii)  tailor  the  2000 \nNational Vehicle Emission Control Regulations to Sichuan conditions (such as the requirement for \nemission testing stickers to be placed in every vehicle meeting the standard); an environmental tax \ncould be applied to any vehicles entering a tollway in the Chengdu area without a valid and \ncompliant sticker; (iii) undertake a baseline air quality study; (iv) design a plan for the installation of \nliquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas filling sites,3 and for a faster conversion (from \npetrol) of buses, taxis, and government motor vehicles; (v) fund emission testing equipment to \nestablish the SPCD testing facility, which should be replicated at various locations;4  (vi) legalize \nthe requirements for new engine technologies such as fuel injection and catalytic converters; and \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Capacity Building in Traffic Safety, Planning \nand Management. Manila. \n3 There are 18 compressed natural gas fuelling stations in Chengdu and plans call for all petrol stations in Chengdu to \nhave compressed natural gas capabilities by 2005. \n4 One testing facility with four bays can inspect about 34,500 vehicles per year. ", "50  Appendix 6 \n(vii)  agree  on  an  action  plan  to  undertake  travel  demand  management  measures,  and  an \nintegrated transport and land use planning approach; (viii) modify the vehicle testing center, or \ncreate inspection stations along the expressway to provide advice to the road users to facilitate \nimplementation of the program and create some funds.  \n \n8.  Implementing  such  a  program  will  require  a  cooperative  effort  among  a  number  of \nagencies, jurisdictions, and community, as well as Government commitment and leadership.  The \nrecommended approach is to implement a pilot vehicle emission testing and certification program, \nfocusing initially on diesel trucks, 2 or 3 wheelers, buses, taxis, and all government vehicles; the \nprogram then could be assessed and adapted for areawide implementation. The pilot program \ncould include (i) identification of vehicle type, (ii) establishment of vehicle inspection sites; (iii) \nconstruction of more compressed natural gas filling stations; (iv) public awareness campaign \nregarding the inspection timetable for vehicles, based on license plate numbers and widely indicate \neconomic incentives, e.g. toll reductions for certified vehicles; (v) intensive training program and \ncapacity building focusing on emission testing, data analysis, and reporting;  (vi) an annual air \nquality monitoring program; (vi)  media, NGO, and community involvement; and (vi) establishment \nof an integrated province emission council. \n \n  2.  Coordination Approach and Action Plan \n \n9.  An action plan is required to promote an efficient vehicle emission reduction measures in \nthe province and in the project area. An integrated approach may be adopted to facilitate the \nimplementation of the action plan. Various departments such as SPCD, environment bureau, and \nSPSB should participate in implementation of the plan. Fuel companies, the private sector, and \nNGO groups can be involved. Modification of current programs of the environment bureau and \noptimization  of  resources  is  necessary  to  enhance  emissions  reduction  in  the  project  area. \nFormulation of a better fine system and other measures will generate some revenue to support the \nprogram. Modification of the vehicle-testing centers and inspection will also provide some funds to \nsupport the proposed program. \n \n10.  A vehicle emissions specialist will be provided under the consulting services, covering \nemissions strategy development, enforcement management, prevention measures, socioeconomic \ncost, and critical issues of successful emission control programs. This assistance will (i) develop \ngeneral provincial vehicle emissions guidelines, covering all key issues; and (ii) develop a time-\nbound action plan in Liangshan and Panzhihua. \n \n11.  Coordination  between  SPCD,  environment  bureau,  and  SPSB,  is  essential.  The \nenvironmental protection bureau will take the lead in implementing the action plan, provide the \nnecessary services, and assign senior officials to ensure smooth implementation and coordination \nwith all parties. Fuel companies, the private sector, and NGO groups may also be involved. \nImplementation of the program will fulfil requirements of current ADB and Government initiatives to \nenhance air quality and minimize greenhouse and global effects. Development of the current \nvehicle testing centers to create an integrated vehicle testing system (both safety and vehicle \nemissions) will be a cost-effective method to support the program. ", "Appendix 7  51\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  Background. The feasibility study and the detailed measurement survey for the Project \nand  stakeholders  consultation  form  the  basis  for  preparing  a  resettlement  plan  (RP).  The \nexpressway component is expected to cause extensive impacts on land and buildings, while the \nlocal  road  component  is  expected  to  have  little  impact  as  works  will  be  on  the  existing \nalignment. The approach adopted to satisfy the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  (ADB's  policy)  will  thus  be  different  for  each  component.  For  the \nexpressway component, a full RP has been prepared. The RP is based on a compensation \nstrategy following the 1998 Land Administration Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nrelevant provincial regulations, and the policy of ADB. \n \n2.  An  RP  will  not  be  prepared  for  the  local  road  upgrading  component.  However,  to \nguarantee that unforeseen impacts are treated in accordance with ADB's policy, the same \ncompensation  framework  for  expressway  impacts  will  be  applied  to  the  local  roads.  To \neffectively  inform  the  village  of  this  provision  and  document  eventual  impacts  of  any \nresettlement  effects  arising  from  this  component,  the  following  provisions  have  been \nestablished: (i) a shorter version of the RP detailing compensation policy and procedures will be \nmade available to all villages along the targeted local roads; (ii) if impacts occur, an impact data \nsheet detailing quantity, area, and compensation will be sent to ADB as soon as the impact is \nknown; and (iii) independent monitoring activities will also cover local roads. \n \n3.  Policy Framework. The RP outlines basic policy principles: (i) negative impacts will be \nminimized as much as possible, (ii) resettlement/compensation will be carried out to improve or \nat least restore the affected people to preproject living standards, (iii) affected people will be \nthoroughly informed and consulted on compensation options and the RP\u2019s design, (iv) affected \nassets  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost,  and  (v)  compensation  and  resettlement \nsubsidies will be provided in full prior to ground leveling and demolition. \n \n4.  The RP also stipulates generic eligibility/entitlement provisions for people losing land, \nhouses, and income, and provides rehabilitation subsidies. Permanent land losses are dealt \nwith through land reallocation within village domains and through cash payments at rates 6\u201310 \ntimes the average annual output value (AAOV) as per the 1998 Land Administration Law. \nTemporary land losses will be directly paid to the affected people at a rate corresponding to the \nAAOV. House losses will be directly paid to the affected people in cash at replacement cost free \nof demolition expenses and salvaged materials. Crop losses will be directly paid to the affected \npeople in cash at rates corresponding to 1 time the AAOV. Affected people will also receive \nvarious subsidies, including a land relocation subsidy of 4\u20136 times the AAOV; a resettlement \nsubsidy to be directly paid to each resettled household for transport costs, work loss, transfer \ncosts, medical expenses, and temporary housing; and a business loss allowance based on tax \ndeclarations to be paid to each person so affected for each month of interruption of business \nactivities. \n \n5.  The RP indicates detailed compensation provisions for each affected village. These \ninclude  the  definition  of  AAOVs,  relative  land  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidies \nmultipliers, and entitlement options to be selected on the basis of village consultation among \nvarious alternatives allowed by the law. \n \n6.  Impact  Assessment. According to the detailed measurement survey based on the \ndetailed design alignment, the project expressway will involve permanent acquisition of 825 \nhectares (ha) of land, including 372 ha of irrigated farmland, 195 ha of dry farmland, 34 ha of ", "52  Appendix 7 \nresidential/service land, and 224 ha of others. Temporary land impacts amount to 117 ha. The \nProject will also require the demolition of 1,257 ha of houses and several public buildings for a \ntotal of 429,481 square meters of building floor space. Approximately 11,000 people (2,400 \nhouseholds) will be affected. Among these, 5,657 (1,208 households) and 383 (82 households) \nwill be affected by house and public building losses, respectively, and will be relocated.  \n \n7.  Resettlement Planning Process. The RP impact data and costs have a high level of \nreliability as they were prepared based on the detailed design alignment through a detailed \nmeasurement survey. The survey was accompanied by a review of the village compensation \nrates and options, a productive improvement plan for each village, and a rehabilitation plan for \nirrigation schemes. The results of the survey and the review was included in a resettlement plan \naddendum.  \n \n8.  Institutional  Responsibilities. The Sichuan Provincial Communications Department \n(SPCD)  through  the  Sichuan  Panxi  Expressway  Company  Limited  (SPECL)  has  overall \nresponsibility for resettlement planning and design tasks. Resettlement implementation and \nfinancing responsibilities will rest on SPECL through the local governments. Prefectures and \ncounties will be responsible for land management tasks, asset valuation, consultation, and \ndelivery of entitlements. Field tasks such as actual payment of entitlements, replacement land \nselection, and provision of livelihood support will be the responsibility of townships and villages. \n \n9.  Vulnerable  Groups. Vulnerable households, defined for the Project as the \"welfare \npoor\"  will  receive  special  assistance  for  house  relocation/reconstruction,  and  will  be  given \nparticular attention for postproject rehabilitation. Specific livelihood improvement strategies for \ntheir benefit are currently under study. These strategies may include provision of employment in \nproject activities and training will be provided.  \n \n10.  Disclosure and Public Consultation. RP preparation was based on an intensive public \nconsultation process carried out through questionnaires and community meetings, and involving \nimplementing  agencies,  local  governments,  and  affected  people.  An  information  booklet \nsummarizing the resettlement plan entitlements policy provisions was released to all affected \npeople through local government offices on 6 February 2002. A summary resettlement plan and \na full resettlement plan were disclosed to the public through ADB\u2019s web site on 5 March 2002 \nand 8 May 2002, respectively.  \n \n11.  Grievance Procedures. Complaints and grievance procedures are established in the \nresettlement plan. Grievances will be first lodged with the village committee. If no agreement is \nreached within 2 weeks, the complainant will have 1 month to raise the case with the county \nland administration bureau or building demolition office. If still unresolved within 2 weeks, the \ncase can be sent to the subproject office. Final appeal will be available in civil courts. \n \n12.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  SPECL  will  establish,  in  collaboration  with  local \ngovernments,  a  monthly  reporting  system  involving  resettlement  staff  at  the  county  and \ntownship  level.  External  monitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent  agency.  Quarterly \ninternal monitoring reports will be sent to ADB. External monitoring reports will be submitted to \nADB twice a year and will include a final evaluation report.
