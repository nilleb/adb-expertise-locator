I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to Nepal for the Subregional Transport Enhancement \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The proposed loan and grant will upgrade the country's road network of about \n195 kilometers (km) to (i) provide a north\u2013south link between the northeastern region and \nthe East\u2013West Highway (EWH), and (ii) improve major international trade corridors in the \ncountry  in  conjunction with  a  modernization  of  customs  systems. The project  will  also \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  road  sector  and  customs  authorities.  By  expanding \nconnectivity in remote areas, increasing road capacity of major international trade corridors, \nand enhancing customs clearance capacity, the project will boost the economy of the project \nareas, and integrate them more effectively with their primary markets in India, and with \nmarkets beyond. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Nepal\u2019s economy relies heavily on foreign trade. The ratio of total trade to gross \ndomestic product is about 50%. While average gross domestic product growth between \nFY2001/02 and FY2008/09 is about 4% per year, average growth in exports and imports is \nabout 5% per year. Trade taxes are a major source of government revenue, e.g., about 22% \nof total government revenue in 2005. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study2 highlights \nthree aspects of subregional trade enhancement in Nepal: (i) focus on products that have \ncomparative advantage, (ii) provide facilities, and (iii) improve connectivity. The eastern \nregion has the potential to step up production of highly exportable herbs and spices, as well \nas of garments and vegetables. Nepal needs to improve its transport network and transit \nlogistics not only to integrate the remote areas of the country, but to create an enabling \nenvironment for its integration into regional and global markets. \n \n4.  Poor connectivity is a major development constraint for Nepal. Inadequate feeder \nroads worsen the isolation of remote rural areas, especially in northern hill regions. These \nareas have a high incidence of poverty and need to be linked to markets in the country, and \neventually to neighboring countries. The north\u2013south link could also be a potential transit \nroute connecting India and the People\u2019s Republic of China. In addition to the connectivity \nissue of remote hill areas, there is growing congestion along major international trade \ncorridors, especially on the EWH and road sections around the borders, because of fast-\nincreasing vehicle numbers in Terai areas. The poor condition and low capacity of the roads, \nand limited capability of customs systems exacerbate the congestion. To address these \nconstraints, the government developed and has been implementing the Priority Investment \nPlan (2007\u20132016) and the customs modernization plan. Nepal has major international and \nsubregional trade corridors as identified in SAARC3 Regional Multimodal Transport Study4 \nand the Asian Highways network. \n \n5.  The  road  sector  development  strategy  under  Nepal's  Three-Year  Interim  Plan \n(FY2007/08\u2013FY2009/10) includes (i) improving roads for the development of high-density \nand border area settlements, and for better access to hitherto unserved remote areas with \neconomic potential, and (ii) developing the EWH as the Asian Highway and the regional \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Unleashing Economic Growth \u2013 Region-based Urban Development Strategy for Nepal. Manila. \n3  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \n4  SAARC Secretariat. 2007.

", "2 \ntrade route in accordance with the concept of developing road networks for promoting South \nAsian regional development. The strategy includes adopting a road asset management \nsystem for sustainable, reliable, and safe road transport operations, and prioritizing repair, \nmaintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of roads and bridges. \n \n6.  Project roads include: (i) the Salleri\u2013Okhaldhunga and (ii) Okhaldhunga\u2013Harkapur \nroads  (100  km),  which  provide  the  remote  northeastern  hill  areas  with  a  north\u2013south \nconnection to the EWH, and further south to the Siraha border; (iii) the Khandbari\u2013Chainpur \nroad (44 km), which provides one of the unconnected district centers with a motorable road, \nand will form the planned north\u2013south transit route connecting India at the Bitranagar border \npoint and the People\u2019s Republic of China at the Kimathanka border; (iv) the Bhairahawa \nbypass (about 3.5 km), part of SAARC Road Corridor 10, connecting Kathmandu with \nLucknow  in  India,  which  also  complements  India's  ongoing  Integrated  Customs  Posts \nProgram; and (v) the Belbari\u2013Chauharwa road (47 km), which is part of the EWH in border \nareas and forms part of the SAARC Road Corridor 4, facilitating subregional traffic via its \nKakarvitta border post to India and Bangladesh. These roads have been selected based on \nenvironment, resettlement, social, and economic impacts; and project readiness. Enhancing \ncross-border  transport  capacity  by  introducing  information  technology  and  simplifying \ncustoms procedures and documentation will further reduce congestion in border areas. \n \n7.  The project will support the government in addressing two development issues: \nexpand connectivity of remote areas and boost the capacity of major international trade \ncorridors.  The  project  is  relevant  to  achieving  the  goals  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy (2010\u20132014)5 of enhancing global\u2013local connectivity to enable regionally balanced \neconomic growth; it is also relevant to the regional cooperation strategy and programs \n(2006\u20132008)6 aimed at improving subregional connectivity and promoting intraregional trade \nin South Asia. The project is included in the country partnership strategy 2010\u20132014 and the \nregional  cooperation  operations  business  plan  (2009\u20132010)7 as  a  national  project  with \nregional implications. This is an approach to accelerating regional cooperation, supported in \nthe Second High Level Forum on Emerging Vision for Shared Prosperity: South Asia and \nBeyond, held in Manila in August 2010. \n \n8.  The project has been designed in coordination with development partners to ensure \nwide geographic coverage and avoid overlaps, and continues ADB's consistent efforts to \nimprove road connectivity and capacity, and facilitate cross-border traffic, in parallel with \ncapacity development relating to road safety, social aspects, overload control, and road asset \nmanagement. Project readiness is substantially advanced, e.g., ADB project appraisal for all \nselected  roads  is  based on  a  detailed  design  prepared  by  consultants engaged  by  the \ngovernment. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  Impact and outcome. The project will promote economic development of Nepal\u2019s \nborder areas and the remote northeastern hills by increasing domestic and regional trades \nthrough  expansion  of  the  national  and  subregional  transport  systems.  The  project  will \n(i) improve connectivity of remote areas with national and subregional markets; and (ii) \nexpand  the  capacity  of  major  international  trade  corridors  in  conjunction  with  the \nmodernization of customs systems, thereby enabling efficient and safe transport within the \ncountry and with India and, through India, with Bangladesh and Bhutan. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2009.

The project will rehabilitate and reconstruct about \n195 km of roads for (i) three road sections to expand connectivity, and (ii) two road sections \nto  enhance  the  capacity  of  major  international  trade  corridors.  Consulting  services  for \nconsulting supervision will also be provided, which includes support to address risks of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \n11.  Trade  facilitation  component. The project will provide equipment and capacity \ndevelopment support to modernize customs clearance systems and facilitate subregional \ntrade. Major equipment includes the upgrade of the automated system for customs data, and \ncomputers  and  network  systems.  The  component  aims  to  transform  the  current \ncomputerized system from a transaction-recording system to a processing tool by providing \n(i) consulting services for reengineering the business process in customs; and (ii) equipment \nand implementation support, including training. \n \n12.  Capacity development component. The project will provide (i) equipment for the \ngovernment to strengthen sector capacity, such as control of overloading, and (ii) consulting \nservices to strengthen institutions such as the Department of Roads (DOR) and the Roads \nBoard Nepal in line with Nepal\u2019s road sector development strategy. Areas requiring capacity \ndevelopment include project management, road asset management, and road technology \nexpertise. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $75.9 million, including taxes and duties, physical \nand price contingencies, and interest during implementation (Table 1).

The government of Nepal has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR16,169,000 and a grant9 not exceeding $24,500,000, both from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance the project. This includes $22.0 million from the subregional pool \nof the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The government will finance the remaining local cost \nof $26.9 million equivalent, or 35.4% of the total cost, including taxes and duties, land \nacquisition and resettlement, office accommodation, and other miscellaneous costs (Table \n2). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank       \n     ADF grant  24.5    32.3 \n     ADF loan  24.5    32.3 \nGovernment  26.9    35.4 \n  Total    75.9    100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the PAM (footnote 8).  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2011\u2013December 2014 \nEstimated completion  31 December 2014 \ndate \nManagement \n(i) Executing agency  MPPW \n(ii) Implementing  DOR \nagency \n(iii) Implementation unit  Main DOR ADB Directorate in Kathmandu, and 5 DOR project site offices \nand 1 DOC project office: Number of staff proposed: 28 \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  2 contracts  About $11.3 million \n  National competitive bidding  14 contracts  About $32.8 million \nSingle source selection with  1 contract  About $1.0 million \nUNCTAD \nShopping  Tbd  Tbd \nConsulting services  PIC with capacity development  59 international  About $4.9 million \n(QCBS)  and 881 national \nperson-months \n  External monitoring (individual)  12 national  About $0.1 million \nperson-months \n  Customs business process  6 international  About 1.0 million \nreengineering (individual and  and 84 national \nQCBS)  person-months \n                                                \n9  A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt \ndistress.

To help enhance transparency and fair competition for bidding, e-submission of bids \nwill be adopted for procurement of national competitive bidding (NCB) work packages. DOR \nhas previously carried out e-procurement, up to the stage of e-submission of bids, for \nprojects funded domestically and by other development partners. The associated procedure \nand mechanism in place have been reviewed as satisfactory. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n18.  The project considered climatic hazards and disaster proneness, and, to the extent \npossible, applied built-in measures to minimize their adverse impacts. For the roads in the \nhill areas, bioengineering technique10 was considered where appropriate to protect and \nstabilize roadside slopes. For the roads in the Terai areas, conventional civil engineering \nmeasures were assessed, including embankment height, design values of storm frequency \nand runoff, and drainage. A road safety audit was undertaken and incorporated during the \ndesign, and will also be undertaken during construction. Overall, the project will (i) develop \nquality roads that sustainably expand connectivity and boost transport efficiency, (ii) improve \ntravel conditions, and (iii) reduce travel time and vehicle operating costs. \n \n19.  Upgrading the customs clearance systems will build on the existing software, taking \ninto account current and future needs. First, a business process reengineering plan will be \ndesigned, then the automated system for customs data will be upgraded and the plan \nimplemented, keeping in mind the eventual establishment of a single-window system for \ntrade facilitation in Nepal. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  Economic viability. The economic assessment was conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.11 Each road has been assessed \nusing standard approaches for road projects. The World Bank\u2019s highway development and \nmanagement model was used for the Bhairahawa bypass and the Belbari\u2013Chauharwa road, \nboth in the Terai region and suited to the model, while a spreadsheet-based analysis, with \nconsumer surplus approach, was used for the hill roads. \n \n                                                \n10 Bioengineering combines vegetation\u2014grass, shrubs, and trees\u2014with minor structures such as dams, walls, \nand drains to manage water and debris, and to protect and stabilize slopes. It is a combination of indigenous \nmethods and modern engineering structures that minimizes cost and maximizes benefits. DOR's division \noffices throughout Nepal now use bioengineering in the construction, maintenance, and upgrading of all roads, \nespecially in hilly and mountainous areas. \n11 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "6 \n21.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) evaluated for the roads varied between \n13% and 35%. The results indicate that the proposed improvements of the project roads are \neconomically viable on all subprojects and in most cases significantly higher than 12%, \nindicating the high economic rate of return. The sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads \nwas  analyzed with  respect to  changes  in the  benefit  and cost  streams. The following \nsensitivity test cases were examined: (i) construction cost increase by 15%, (ii) benefit \ndecrease by 15%, (iii) excluding producer surplus benefits for hill roads, (iv) construction \ndelay  by  1  year,  and  (v)  a  combination  of  (i)  and  (ii).  Two  of  the  roads  (Harkapur\u2013\nOkhaldhunga and Okhaldhunga\u2013Salleri) have an EIRR below 12% in some of the sensitivity \nanalysis cases. The EIRRs in these cases range from 9.7% to 11.5%, which are marginally \nbelow 12%. These two roads are also connected to function as one road, which has a higher \nEIRR in a combined economic analysis. Both roads serve underdeveloped remote areas \nand their improvement will have a positive impact on the development of these areas. \nConsidering the positive development impact of these two roads and an EIRR of more than \n9% even in the worst-case sensitivity scenario, they are recommended for implementation, \nalong with all other roads included in the analysis.12 \n \n22.  Financial sustainability. Incremental recurrent costs associated with the project are \nestimated at 5% of the current DOR maintenance budget and less than 1% of the overall \nDOR budget on an annual basis. Maintenance will be required after project completion in \n2013 and an adequate budget increase is expected in view of recent trends. It is reasonable \nto expect that funds will be available to meet these costs. The government has earmarked a \nbudget amount for periodic maintenance, and assures that it will fund 100% of routine and \nperiodic maintenance. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  Institutional. DOR, the implementing agency, was established in 1961 under the \nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW). DOR is responsible for the development \nand maintenance of the strategic road network, which comprises the national arterial roads, \nand major feeder roads connecting to local and rural roads. DOR is headed by a director \ngeneral who reports to the secretary of MPPW.  \n \n24.  DOR has a good record of implementing ADB-funded projects, and has sufficient \ncapacity, past experience, and institutional strength to implement this project. DOR capacity \nis further augmented by the World Bank\u2019s support13 and ongoing ADB capacity development \ntechnical assistance, including training in carrying out feasibility studies for road transport \nprojects and adopting best practices in contract management and quality assurance.14 DOR \nwill also get support from the provision of consulting services to assist with the supervision of \nworks. \n \n25.  Financial management. Financial management assessment was carried out for the \nimplementing agency. DOR has ample experience in implementing ADB-funded projects, \nenough  capacity  to  carry  out  project  financial  accounting,  and  knowledge  of  ADB \ndisbursement  procedures.  Within  the  DOR  Project  Directorate  (ADB),  the  project \nimplementation unit for the road transport component, there will be a dedicated project \naccounting and finance team with a suitably qualified chief project accountant and two \nassistant accountants. \n                                                \n12 Details of the economic assessment are in Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n13 The World Bank has been providing support to the overall institutional strengthening, especially in the areas of \nmanagement information systems, road safety action plan, safeguard implementation capacity, quality control, \nand human resources management. \n14 ADB. 2006.

Manila (Grant 0051-NEP for $55.2 million and TA 4825-NEP for $0.3 million, approved on 20 \nJuly). \n ", "7 \n \n26.  DOR will establish and maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate \naudit  trail.  The  government's  Office  of  Auditor  General  will  annually  audit  the  project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  international  auditing \nstandards. To further minimize risks, ADB's direct payment procedure will be used for \nsubstantial disbursements for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n27.  Procurement  and  anticorruption. The government has promulgated the Public \nProcurement  Act  (2007)  and  Public  Procurement  Regulations  (2007),  both  generally \nacceptable to ADB and encompassing best international procurement practices. To be in \nline with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), the NCB \nannex in the procurement plan will be applied for the national competitive bidding. The \nPublic Procurement Monitoring Office15 has been assigned as the national procurement \noversight body under the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. E-submission \nof  bids  will  be  adopted  for  the  NCB  to  substantially  increase  transparency  and  fair \ncompetition in bidding, as shown in projects funded domestically and by other development \npartners. The government will publish information on the project on DOR\u2019s website, including \nbusiness  opportunities  associated  with  the  project,  and  information  on  procurement  of \ngoods, works, and consulting services. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  the  executing  agency  (MPPW),  and  the  implementing \nagency (DOR). Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM (footnote 8). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  Poverty reduction and social impact. The poverty situation in Nepal is serious. \nMore than 26% of the people earn less than the government poverty line of NRs10,000 \n($140) per year. Rural poverty is almost twice as high as urban poverty. According to the \nNepal Living Standard Survey 2004, the poverty incidence in the rural districts that will be \naffected by the project ranges from 29% to 46%, as against 30.8% nationally. Most of these \ndistricts are also deemed food-insecure, where food is supplied from outside markets and in \nmost cases from abroad. The majority of households have a food deficit for 3\u20139 months a \nyear. As transportation  proves  difficult  because  roads  are  in  poor  condition  or  lacking \naltogether, it has been a challenge to supply food in time and at low cost. The lack of roads \nalso  limits  people\u2019s  chances  to  grow  and  sell  agricultural  products  to  the  neighboring \nmarkets. \n \n30.  For the poverty and social assessment, 871 households were selected randomly at \ncorridors of impacts. For census for resettlement assessment, 579 affected households were \ntaken. Most primary stakeholders acknowledged the positive impacts of the project. With \nimproved roads and better connectivity, farmers will be able to sell agricultural products to \nthe neighboring markets, and thus grow larger marketable surpluses. A larger marketable \nsurplus will generate more paid agricultural employment, particularly benefiting the poor, and \nthus  improve  the  food  situation  in  the  project  districts.  The  project  will  also  create \nemployment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during project implementation. It will \nenable  reliable  access  to  social  services,  particularly  health-care  services,  education \nfacilities, and supply of drinking water. The direct (access to services and markets) and \nindirect benefits (employment) of the project will help reduce poverty and improve the quality \nof life.16 \n                                                \n15 ADB is providing technical assistance to strengthen the Public Procurement Monitoring Office in order to \nimplement requirements of the newly enacted act and regulations. \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n31.  Gender. The project will have no negative gender impacts. It will provide both men \nand women with direct employment opportunities during implementation, better delivery of \nservices, and easier access to markets, quality health-care facilities, and higher education. \nDiscussions were held with 39 focus groups, of which 28 had mixed male and female \nparticipation, and 11 were women-only groups. The number of participants during each \ndiscussion ranged from 13 to 52 in mixed groups and from 9 to 14 in female groups. Focus \ngroup discussions with women and communities revealed that women primarily look after \ndomestic and agricultural activities. About 11% of the women work outside their homes, as \nconstruction or agriculture laborers. Only 2% are employed in services, in schools or in \ngovernment offices. Women engaged in the non-agriculture sector, such as services and \nconstruction, are also responsible for domestic affairs, such as taking care of children and \nhousehold chores, or looking after cattle. Most respondents welcomed the project.  \n \n32.  The project will ensure that civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor \nlaws, including elimination of gender-differentiated wages. Men and women directly affected \nby the project will be given priority of employment under the project. Contractors must pay \nequal wages to men and women employed for work of equal value; a specific clause will be \nincluded  in  bidding  documents  and  compliance  will  be  monitored  during  project \nimplementation  by  a  gender  specialist  engaged  under  the  project  implementation \nconsultants, and by external monitoring. \n \n33.  HIV/AIDS. Nepal had 4,861 (3,545 males and 1,316 females) reported HIV (including \nAIDS)  cases  as  of  March  2005.  At  present,  there  are  more  than  50  nongovernment \norganizations  working  in  the  area  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  and  57  nongovernment \norganizations  in  anti-trafficking  activities,  in  addition  to  United  Nations  agencies  and \ngovernment efforts. The National Center for AIDS and STD Control under the Ministry of \nHealth  and  Population  coordinates  the  activities  of  all  stakeholders  in  fulfilling  the \ncommitments  made  in  the  National  AIDS  Strategy  (2002\u20132006),  which  emphasizes \nprevention  as  the  mainstay  for  an  effective  response.  Anti-trafficking  activities  are \ncoordinated by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare. There already exists a \nlarge  number  of  information  and  education  print  material  on  anti-trafficking  developed \nthrough  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  support,  which  may  be \nreproduced for use in project areas. Although the social assessment undertaken has not \nbrought forth significant risks of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the project districts, these \nrisks may  be  aggravated once  connectivity has  increased.  To  prevent  this,  a  gender \nspecialist  engaged  as  part  of  the  project  implementation  consultants  will  develop  and \nimplement an HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program that includes raising awareness of \ngender issues and child labor. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  Environment. The project is classified \"B\" in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  and  therefore,  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were \nprepared for the subprojects. DOR has submitted all IEEs for ADB approval, and they are \nnow available to interested stakeholders upon request. 17 Findings of the IEEs indicate that \nthe project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental impact since no forest \nareas,  wildlife  sanctuaries,  national  parks,  biodiversity-critical  habitats,  or  similar  eco-\nsensitive areas will be traversed or lie within the corridors of impact as defined in the \nenvironmental assessment. Four subprojects will upgrade existing roads with no additional \nright-of-way requirements, and minor alignment changes will be made in conformance with \nroad  safety  standards. Only  the  Bhairahawa bypass will  require  a  new  alignment  and \n                                                \n17 Initial Environmental Examination: Bhairahawa Bypass Road, Initial Environmental Examination: Chainpur\u2014\nKhandbari  Road,  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Harkapur\u2014Okhaldunga  Road,  Initial  Environmental \nExamination: Okhaldunga\u2014Salleri Road (Appendix 2). The Belbari\u2014Chauharwa Road was classified as \u201cC.\u201d \n ", "9 \nconversion of predominantly agricultural lands, but given its limited length of less than 3.5 \nkm, this subproject is not foreseen to generate significant adverse impacts. \n \n35.  Most impacts are likely to occur during construction stage, associated with earth \nmovement, embankment shaping, paving, heavy equipment operation, and unpaved-road \ntravel. These impacts are temporary in nature, and mitigating measures are readily designed \nand easily implemented. Adequate attention was given to improving drainage and preventing \nerosion along rugged terrain. Coordinated efforts by the Department of Forest and Wildlife \nand DOR will be implemented for the Harkapur\u2013Okhaldhunga Road subproject, including \nsetting up a monitoring office in the area to prevent illegal logging activities that may \nincrease once access to the nearby unclassified secondary forest is made easier.  \n \n36.  No irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented environmental impacts are expected to \noccur and a further environmental impact assessment is not needed. The Geo-Environment \nand  Social  Unit  of  the  DOR  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental \nmanagement plan, with most activities during construction phase to be implemented by the \ncontractors. This will be in accordance with the subproject-specific monitoring plans. The \nGeo-Environment and Social Unit will prepare annual environmental audit reports for the \nMPPW during project operation.  \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is classified \"B\" in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. It has been developed with a view to minimize land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement. Where possible, construction activities will take place within \nthe existing right-of-way. A census was conducted based on the detailed design. Out of five \nsubprojects, three will have minor land acquisition impacts and no resettlement is envisaged. \nResettlement plans have been prepared for (i) Harkapur\u2013Okhaldhunga road (42 km), (ii) \nOkhaldhunga\u2013Salleri road (58 km), and (iii) Bhairahawa bypass (about 3.5 km), to address \nland acquisition and livelihood impacts.  \n \n38.  In all, 902 households will be affected by the project, out of which 10 will suffer partial \nimpact  on  their structures.  Of those  10,  none  will  be  physically displaced  since  these \nhouseholds have enough remaining land to construct new structures adjacent to the affected \nstructures.  Only economically displaced households will lose a strip of agricultural land, \nwhich is identified to be less than 10% of their total land holdings. The displaced households \nwill be entitled to compensation for the loss of land and/or structure (at replacement cost) \nand  for  shifting  costs,  and  to  other  income-restoring  assistance.  The  total  cost  for \nimplementing the resettlement plan has been estimated to be NRs487,791,989 ($6.6 million).  \n \n39.  Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  \"B\"  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Indigenous people constitute about 37.2% of Nepal\u2019s total \npopulation.  The  government  has  declared  59  groups  as  indigenous  peoples.  The \nparameters of defining them include language, physical structure, and the religious and \nsocioeconomic differences. The most populous indigenous group is Magar, followed by \nTharu, Tamang, Newar, Limbu, Rai, and Sherpa.  \n \n40.  Key indigenous groups in the project areas are Newar, Magar, Sherpa, and Tamang. \nMeaningful consultations, held in an atmosphere free of coercion, were conducted to ensure \na comprehensive perspective on the project and its impacts, and to ascertain community \nresponse to the project, their needs and demands from the project, an estimate of losses \nthat they would suffer, and steps to mitigate those losses. Social impact assessments \nconfirmed that indigenous people will not be affected more than the rest of the population \nand will benefit equally from the socioeconomic opportunities created by the project. A \ncombined  indigenous  peoples  plan  and  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  three \nsubprojects. Adequate compensation provisions have been made in the combined plan to \nmitigate the impacts on indigenous peoples. \n \n ", "10 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n41.  An  assessment  of  peace  building,  governance  risk,  and  climate  change  was \nundertaken. The peace-building tool developed by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Nepal \nResident Mission helped the overall design, with a stronger focus on people\u2019s participation in \ndecision making, creating opportunities for local employment, avoiding the use of child labor, \nraising HIV/AIDS awareness, carrying out skills training and an anti-trafficking campaign, \nand  educating  the  people  in  the  zone  of  influence.  The  governance  risk  assessment \nidentified potential risks in public financial management, procurement, and corruption, as \nalso  mentioned  in  the  due  diligence.  Because  the  country  falls  within  the  mountain \necosystem, climate change would result in accelerated glacial melting, rockfalls, landslides, \nand glacial lake outburst floods. Given that the tracks of the roads already exist and that the \nglaciers and glacial lakes are distant, there is no increased risk from the project. The project \nconsidered climatic hazards and disaster proneness, and, to the extent possible, applied \nbuilt-in measures to minimize their adverse impacts as mentioned in the due diligence. \n \n42.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.18  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n43.  The government and MPPW have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and financing documents. \n \n44.  The government and MPPW have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the financing agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR16,169,000 to Nepal for the \nSubregional  Transport  Enhancement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including \na  grace  period  of  8 years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $24,500,000 to Nepal, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, for the Subregional Transport Enhancement Project, on terms and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nfinancing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n4 October 2010 \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nPromoted economic  Traffic volume along the  Post-implementation  Various government \ndevelopment of  project corridor increased  measurement  development activities \nNepal\u2019s border areas  20% more than the    effectively coordinated \nand the remote  country's average traffic  Government  with road sector \nnortheastern hills by  growth rate (13% average  socioeconomic statistics  investment \nincreasing domestic  in the past 5 years)     \nand regional trades    Border post statistics  Cross-border transport \nthrough expansion of  Volume of cross-border  is streamlined, e.g., \nthe national and  traffic increased by 30%  cross-border transport \nsubregional transport  more than the country's  agreement \nsystems  average traffic growth rate \n   (i.e., 13% in average past \n5 years) \n \nEconomic activities in \nproject-influenced areas \nincreased by 10% more \nthan the country's average \neconomic growth rate (i.e., \n4% in FY2009/10) \n  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved connectivity  Average travel time along  Post-implementation  Timely and quality \nof remote areas and  major trade roads covered  measurement  project delivery \nexpanded the  by the project cut by 40%     \ncapacity of major  (from more than 2 hours)    Transport modes and \ninternational trade      services available for \ncorridors in  Opened access to remote    the project roads \nconjunction with the  areas for the whole year     \nmodernization of  (from 290 days)    The government \ncustoms systems,      provides routine and \nthereby enabling  Waiting time for customs    periodic maintenance \nefficient and safe  clearance reduced by 1\u20132    throughout the project \ntransport within the  hours (from 4 hours for    life. \ncountry and with India  documentation clearance)   \nand, through India,     \nwith Bangladesh and  Fatality rate along the  Accident data \nBhutan.  project corridors not   \n  exceeding the country's   \naverage fatality rate (i.e.,   \n25 per 10,000 motorized   \nvehicles)   \n   \nImproved women\u2019s access  Gender impact \nto social services, health- assessment \ncare services, education \nfacilities, supply of drinking \nwater, and employment \nopportunity \n \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImproved awareness of \ngender issues, child labor, \nHIV/AIDS, and human \ntrafficking \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
