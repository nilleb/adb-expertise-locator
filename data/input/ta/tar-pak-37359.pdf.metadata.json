In September 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved its social protection \nstrategy,1 covering five areas identified by ADB as main target areas of social protection: (i) \nlabor markets, (ii) social insurance, (iii) social assistance, (iv) micro- and area-based schemes, \nand (v) child protection. The Government of Pakistan\u2019s (GOP) poverty reduction strategy paper \ngives high priority to improving social protection. ADB is assisting the federal and provincial \ngovernments in various areas of social protection. In August 2003, ADB approved technical \nassistance (TA) to develop the social protection strategy,2 which had a component on health \ninsurance\u2014an integral part of social protection.  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s country strategy program for Pakistan (2004\u20132006) foresees for 2005 a TA for \nsocial health insurance.3 The TA will build on the results of the study mentioned above, which \nlaid out the general framework for social health insurance in Pakistan, while this planned TA will \nfocus on the elaboration of a concept for one province. \n \n3.  ADB conducted a Fact-Finding Mission on 7\u201316 February 2005. The Mission met with \ngovernment  federal  and  provincial  officials  and  stakeholders  (in  the  North-West  Frontier \nProvince  [NWFP],  Punjab,  and  Sindh)  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  provincial \ngovernment of Punjab on the TA goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for the consulting services. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  With a population of 149 million growing by 1.9% per year, Pakistan is ranked 138 of 173 \ncountries covered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) human development \nindex. It falls under \"low human development.\"  \n \n5.  Average growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was 4.6% in the 1990s, against 6.5% \nin the 1980s. Over the last four years, economic growth has increased robustly, from 5.1% in \nFY2003 to 6.4% in FY2004, and jumping to 8.3% in FY2005.4 However, growth has not always \nled to poverty reduction. Periods of high economic growth have witnessed declines in poverty, \nas in the 1980s, but also increases, as in the 1960s. Periods of low economic growth have seen \npoverty sharply increase, as in the 1990s, but also fall, as in the 1970s.5 Poverty was around \n32% in 2001 (latest figure available). \n \n6.  Even though there is much need for it, social protection is limited in all five areas \nidentified by the ADB social protection strategy. To help the poor, however, the federal and \nprovincial governments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the private sector are (i) \nimproving governance in public sector institutions, (ii) creating jobs and income-generating \nopportunities, (iii) strengthening social safety net systems, and (iv) improving access to basic \nservices.  \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

Total expenditure on social protection represents around 2% of GDP, of which 90% is on \nsocial insurance and health care for selected groups, 5.3% of the poor receive some form of \nsocial protection, and around 10.0% of total social expenditure goes to the poor. \n \n8.  Formal social security systems are restricted to civil servants, the army, the police, as \nwell as some formal sector enterprises (with five or more employees). These schemes cover \nless than 3% of the total employed labor force. There are hardly any informal, traditional, \ncommunity-based  insurance  arrangements  (for  example  micro-insurance).  There  is  also  a \ngender and rural-urban bias in social protection schemes. \n \n9.  One major pillar of any social protection network is access to free or affordable health \ncare.  Major  health  incidents,  especially  those  of  catastrophic  dimensions,  may  aggravate \nhouseholds\u2019 poverty or even bankrupt families. \"The development of the private health sector is \nalso constrained by the low level of development of the health insurance industry. The lack of \naccess to health insurance poses a major problem for the financing of care for catastrophic \nepisodes of illness and injuries.\"6 Risk pooling, for example through health insurance, may \nprevent households from falling into poverty, and those who are already poor will have the \nchance to get access to better health services. Health insurance thus greatly helps reduce and \nprevent poverty. Even when health insurance does not pay for services, it can negotiate prices \nfor health care and thus make the costs of services more transparent. At several levels, health \ninsurance became an issue in Pakistan. The federal Ministry of Health is discussing how else to \nextend coverage of health insurance. The government of Punjab has installed a task force to \nlook into the feasibility of providing health insurance for more people. Interest in the subject is \nthus increasing. \n \n10.  In general, public health expenditure is very low in Pakistan (3.5% of the public budget is \nspent on health, and public health expenditure is 0.7% of GDP). National public expenditure on \nhealth is $4 per capita, while total expenditure on health is $18 per capita. This shows the high \nshare of private health care spending, including by households, which accounts for 75.6% of \nhealth  care  expenditure.7  Social  health  insurance  covers  only  5%  of  the  population  but \nrepresents about 40% of federal and provincial governments spending on health. \n \n11.  The  health  care  financing  system  consists  of  three  alternative  protection  schemes, \nwhere health insurance still represents a small segment. The public has access to the public \nsystem  financed  by  the  federal  and  provincial  governments.  Public  health  care  facilities \ncomprise basic health units, rural health centers, and public hospitals. Although public health \ncare is supposed to be free, problems encountered are (i) frequent unofficial charges, (ii) lack of \ndrugs and supplies (which have to be bought outside by the patients), and (iii) absenteeism of \nstaff.  \n \n12.  Employees in the formal sector are covered by the social security health insurance \nsystem (Employees Social Security Institution). The formal sector includes employees of private \ncompanies with a minimum number of employees (the number differs by province, from 5 to 10) \nand their families. These social security institutions operate health facilities at the province level. \nWith many facilities in rented buildings and the better ones in newly built facilities owned by the \nsocial security institutions, the quality of the facilities varies but is better than in the public \nsector.  \n \n13.  Private insurance companies also offer health insurance. Despite the high cost, private \ninsurance companies have filled a market segment purchasing and providing quality health care \n                                                 \n6 World Bank. 1998. Concept Paper on a Microinsurance Pilot Project in NWFP. Washington, DC. \n7 World Health Organization. 2005. WHO Statistical Information System. Available http://www.who.int/whosis. \n ", "  3\nmainly  as  an  employee  benefit  for  private  companies,  because  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments health services are so poor. Group health insurance is offered by seven insurance \ncompanies, and individual health insurance by one insurance company (Allianz EFU). Because \nof the high expense, large companies self-insure or provide their own medical facilities for \nemployees.  \n \n14.  The poor receive some assistance mainly financed by two autonomous institutions\u2014the \nZakat fund8 ($133 million disbursed in 2003) and Bait-Ul-Maal9 ($38 million disbursed in 2003). \nThe  Zakat  fund  supports  hospitals,  which,  in  turn,  help  the  eligible  poor.  Bait-Ul-Maal \nreimburses claims to those who have applied for assistance and are found to be eligible. Both \nfunds, however, can only serve a small portion of the 50 million poor. \n \n15.  Those who do not avail themselves of health insurance or of the two funds, and do not \nwant to use public providers because of their low quality, have to buy health care from private \nproviders (doctors, dentists, clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies) or from the many traditional \nhealers  and  quacks,  especially  in  the  rural  areas.  Even  the  poor  frequently  use  private \nproviders, which explains the high share of health expenditure from private households.  \n \n16.  Social health insurance covering most of the population is a new concept in Pakistan, \nwhich  requires  major  assistance  and  a  lot  of  awareness  raising,  capacity  building,  and \ninstitutional  development.  So  far,  not  much  assistance  has  been  given  to  the  federal  or \nprovincial governments in the sector.  \n \n(i)  The World Bank has tried to support health insurance pilots in NWFP and Punjab \n($1  million)  in  2004,  but  these  have  been  canceled.  The  Japan  Social \nDevelopment Fund withdrew its funding because the project was not initiated on \ntime as implementing NGOs could not solve their problems on ownership of the \ninsurance.  \n \n(ii)  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  [GTZ])  mainly  provides  TA  to  the  provincial \ngovernment of NWFP to finance health care. \n \n17.  The government of Punjab has made major efforts to study the possibility and feasibility \nof health insurance, elaborating on how to extend health insurance to the poor through federal \nor provincial government subsidies as well as on how to cover public servants. \n \n18.  Social health insurance is a concept developed in European industrialized countries and \ncovers the whole population against financial losses due to illness and accidents. The concept \nhas also been adapted to newly industrialized and developing countries. The People\u2019s Republic \nof China, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Mongolia, and Viet Nam have developed social \nhealth insurance schemes. Their experiences can serve as a model for Pakistan. \n \n                                                 \n8  Zakat is a state-based option for Muslims to meet their charitable obligations through a deduction once a year at \nthe rate of 2.5 per cent on the value of certain financial assets. \n9  Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal is a semi-autonomous organization within the Ministry of Women Development, Welfare and \nSpecial Education. Unlike Zakat, Bait-ul-Mal benefits are open to all regardless of creed. Also, unlike Zakat, the \nfunds are entirely controlled by public servants. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The TA\u2019s impact is the improved capability of the population to cope with the costs of \nhealth care. The TA is in line with the poverty reduction strategy paper and with ADB's social \nprotection strategy.  \n \n20.  The outcome will be a detailed proposal to the provincial government of Punjab for a \ncomprehensive and coordinated design of a social health insurance for Punjab. Punjab was \nchosen  (though  NWFP  and  Sindh  were  also  interested)  because  initial  preparations  have \nalready been made and its ownership of the plan is strong. The plan will include (i) target \ngroups;  (ii)  benefits  of  the  insurance;  (iii)  possible  target  districts  for  the  planned  health \ninsurance; (iv) identification of needs for administrative and institutional development with a \nspecial  focus  on  possible  links  to  existing  institutions;  (v)  a  financial  plan;  (vi)  possible \ninvolvement of the provincial government of Punjab, development partners, and ADB; (vii) an \noverview of service providers and their link to the health insurance; (viii) terms of reference for \nconsulting services and other inputs needed to set up the health insurance; (ix) identification of \nlegal arrangements; and (x) assessment of the economic viability and financial sustainability of \na proposed health insurance scheme. The consultants will provide the provincial government of \nPunjab and ADB with a technical background report with the design of the health insurance and \nmeasures and resources to implement it. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n21.  The TA will help the provincial government of Punjab design a health insurance for \nPunjab.  Tentative  activities  and  components  needed  to  set  up  a  health  insurance  are  in \nAppendix 2. The TA will  \n(i)  identify  target  groups  and  their  needs  in  consultation  with  the  provincial \ngovernment of Punjab, stakeholders, and communities; \n(ii)  identify needs to review, revise, amend, and develop existing health insurance \nand health care arrangements, including legal arrangements;  \n(iii)  assess the environment and the available infrastructure for health insurance; \n(iv)  assess results of and lessons learned from other projects and activities going on \nin Pakistan and in countries where health insurance schemes were recently \ncreated; \n(v)  conduct intensive stakeholder, federal and the provincial government of Punjab, \nand external funding agency consultations to get maximum support for the health \ninsurance, and conduct focus group discussions in the communities to assess \nproblems and the preparedness for the concept of health insurance; \n(vi)  finalize a technical report describing in detail the proposed health insurance \narrangements,  including  target  groups,  benefits,  administrative  arrangements, \nrelationships to providers, costs, and financing; and \n(vii)  based  on  the  health  insurance  design,  describe  activities  and  components \nneeded to implement the health insurance and, in consultation with the provincial \ngovernment of Punjab, identify districts where the insurance can be piloted. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n22.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $440,000 equivalent, of which $196,000 will be \nforeign currency cost, and $244,000 equivalent will be local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$350,000 equivalent, which will include the entire foreign currency cost and $154,000 equivalent \nin local currency costs. The remaining $90,000 equivalent will be contributed by the provincial \ngovernment of Punjab and will include office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, \nsurveys, and workshops. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's  TA funding \nprogram. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The federal and \nprovincial governments have been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Department of Health in Punjab, led by the \nsecretary of health. A steering committee, headed by the secretary of health will be created. \nMembers of the steering committee will be representatives from the Department of Finance, \nPlanning and Development Board, Department of Labor, Department of Social Welfare, as well \nas from the federal Ministry of Health. The steering committee will meet at least three times. The \nconsulting team and the steering committee will be assisted by a technical working group \n(TWG). The main task of the TWG (Appendix 4) is to serve as a critical partner in reviewing the \noutputs, give advice on optimizing the results, and support the project in specific areas. \n \n24.  The TA will be carried out over six months, from September 2005 to February 2006. It \nwill have a total input of 26 person-months of consultancy: 7 person-months of international and \n19person-months  of  domestic  services.  The  consulting  team  will  include  as  international \nconsultants a social health insurance planning specialist and team leader (5 person-months), \nand an actuary (2 person-months); and as domestic consultants, a health sector specialist and \ndeputy team leader (5 person-months), a financial analyst (4 person-months), a legal specialist \n(4 person-months), a community development and gender specialist (3 person-months), and a \npoverty analyst (3 person-months).  \n \n25.  All consultants will be recruited through a firm using simplified technical proposals. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Quality- and cost-based selection will be \nused to select consultants. A project director from the Department of Health will coordinate the \nother government agencies. \n \n26.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report, no later than 2 weeks after fielding of \nthe  consultants;  (ii)  a  draft  final  report,  5  months  after  inception,  on  which  the  provincial \ngovernment of Punjab and ADB will comment; and (iii) a final report, within 2 weeks after \nreceiving comments from the review. The consulting team will be prepared to answer questions \nthat  may  arise  after  submission  of  the  final  report.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for the Developing Social Health Insurance Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions: \nImproved capability of the  Provincial government  Provincial government of  \u2022  Provincial government of \npopulation to cope with  of Punjab decision to  Punjab decisions  Punjab ownership \nthe costs of health care   implement health  \u2022  Provincial government of \n  insurance in Punjab  Punjab implements the \nplanned health insurance \nOutcome      Assumptions: \nHealth insurance design  Memorandum of  Memorandum of  \u2022  ADB and the provincial \nand feasibility study  understanding signed by  understanding  government of Punjab agree \nagreed on by the  the provincial  on the design \nprovincial government of  government of Punjab and  \u2022  The provincial government \nPunjab and ADB  ADB during the review  of Punjab and stakeholders \n  mission in February 2006  continue to be interested in \nthe subject \n\u2022   \nOutputs      Assumption: \n1.
