On 20 December 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Small and \nMedium  Enterprise  (SME)1  Sector  Development  Program  (SMESDP)2  to  (i)  strengthen  the \nenabling business environment for SMEs, (ii) catalyze investment by improving SMEs\u2019 access to \ncommercial  finance,  and  (iii)  enhance  the  capacity  of  providers  of  business  development \nservices  (BDS).  The  SMESDP  included  (i)  a  policy  reform  loan  amounting  to  $20  million \nequivalent, (ii)  a  credit  assistance  program  loan  amounting  to  $60 million,  (iii) a  business \nsupport  services  facility  (BSSF)  amounting  to  $6  million  equivalent,  and  (iv)  a  technical \nassistance (TA) grant for enabling SME growth amounting to $1.25 million.  \n \n2.  Due  to  the  satisfactory  progress  in  implementing  SMESDP3,  the  improved  security \nsituation resulting from the third year of a cease-fire agreement after two decades of civil war, \nand improved economic growth (real gross domestic product [GDP] growth rate has been in the \nrange of 5.25\u20136.0% since mid-2002), the project preparatory TA4 was included in the 2005\u2013\n2006 country strategy and program update for Sri Lanka dated September 2004. Additionally, \nthe economic growth strategy of the Government of Sri Lanka is to support SMEs, particularly \nSMEs in the non-urban/rural areas of the country. The growth strategy focuses on increased \nexport trade as well as financial and legal reforms. The purpose of the TA is to assist the \nGovernment in preparing the overall design and principal components of a follow-on project for \nSMESDP, SME Sector Development Program II (SMESDP II). The fact-finding mission fielded \nto Colombo in February 2005 reached understanding with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA is designed to build \non ADB\u2019s earlier assistance, lessons learned, and support provided by SMESDP.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Economic growth in Sri Lanka is primarily generated by the large, private enterprises \nand/or SMEs located in the major industrial areas in the western region of the country. In other \nparts of the country, SME growth is stagnant, characterized by relatively few new businesses \nand limited expansion of existing businesses.  \n \n4.  Policy  Constraints.  Dynamic  growth  and  development  of  SMEs  are  restricted  by, \namong other things, the presence of regulatory constraints, weak skills base, limited market \nintelligence to compete in a global economy, and limited access to finance. Further policy \nreforms such as improving the business environment, facilitating export trade, and enhancing \ncompetition will support the growth and development of SMEs throughout the country. \n \n5.  Export Trade. As of end-2004, Sri Lanka was a net importer of goods. Exports grew by \n12% compared with the 9% growth recorded in 2003 and amounted to approximately $5.8 \nbillion or 28% of GDP, while imports surged by 20% to $8 billion or 39% of GDP, reflecting the \nimpact, among other things, of the escalation of oil prices. The result is a widening of the trade \n                                                 \n1  An SME is an enterprise having less than 100 employees. \n2  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program. \nManila. \n3  Program implementation is discussed in ADB. 2003. Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program \nProgress Report: Release of Second Tranche. Manila. Loan 1894-SRI was closed on 18 April 2005. The Business \nServices Support Facility Loan (1895-SRI) is being implemented (para. 14), and the $60 million credit assistance \n(Loan 1896-SRI) is fully committed.   \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 25 February 2005. ", "2   \nbalance by $704 million to $2.2 billion. The Government has a strong interest in increasing \nexport trade, but success depends on the production and distribution of competitively priced, \nhigh-quality products that would satisfy the demands in the international market. \n \n6.  Industry Sector. The industry sector, of which approximately 90% consists of SMEs in \nSri Lanka, represents approximately 26% of GDP, and comprises primarily production and sale \nof raw materials and semifinished goods. If the sector were to produce high-value finished \ngoods, impact on real income growth in the country would be higher. Production of high-value \nfinished goods would also indirectly stimulate the demand for raw materials as well as for \nsemifinished  goods,  thereby  further  fostering  overall  economic  growth.  Additionally,  further \nemphasis on product design would enhance export demand for finished goods. \n7.  Quality Standards. Because of limited quality control in the production of goods as well \nas limited quality standards in the sale of goods (e.g., there are no mandatory food safety \nstandards) foreign manufacturers have gained a share of the domestic market. \n \n8.  Agro-industry. Agriculture is the primary industry in the rural areas of the country, \nrepresenting approximately 20% of GDP. The agro-industry sector contributes nearly one fourth \nto the value of industrial production. Yet, agro-industrial exports account for only about 3% of \ntotal industrial exports, implying that a major portion of agro-industrial goods produced in Sri \nLanka are consumed by the domestic market. The greatest potential for value-addition lies in \nthe  processed  foods  and  beverages  category  and  the  scope  for  increased  exports  is \nconsiderable, given the nation\u2019s varied agroclimatic zones, fertile soils, and rich agricultural \npotential. Historically, limited efforts have been made in promoting strong bonds with the small \nfarmers to develop agro-industry, such as development of mechanisms for outgrower schemes \n(i.e., linked to processing activities) and forward sales agreements. Improved marketing and \npostharvest systems are needed to generate significant rural growth and increased prosperity \nled by agro-industry. \n \n9.  Technology. Improved quality, reduced production costs, and increased productivity \nyields in Sri Lanka\u2019s industries should be improved through the development and use of more \nmodern technologies. Historically, most technologies developed in state-owned research and \ndevelopment institutes have not been integrated into the manufacturing processes. Industry \nwould be better served if technology were developed in joint collaboration with industrial users \n(e.g., SMEs) and transferred to the private sector through joint venture programs, public-private \npartnerships, etc.  \n \n10.  ISO  Certification.  Many  locally  produced  goods  do  not  meet  the  quality  and/or \nenvironmental  standards  established  by  the  International  Standards  Organization  (ISO).  \nFurthermore, the state-owned Sri Lanka Standards Institute, which is responsible for issuing \nISO  certificates,  lacks  some  of  the  necessary  skills  and  testing  equipment  to  issue  such \ncertificates. To promote export trade, the Sri Lanka Standards Institute must be enhanced, and \nthe industry sector must be encouraged to obtain ISO certification for its products.   \n \n11.  Infrastructure.  Lack  of  suitable  industrial  sites  and  specialized  infrastructure  (e.g., \nmanufacturing  facilities,  warehouses,  waste  management  disposal  facilities,  offices  etc.) \ncontributes  to  inefficient  processing  and  production,  wastage,  spoilage,  and  higher \ntransportation  costs in manufacturing  process. The Investment  Climate Study5  identified  poor  \n                                                 \n5  ADB and World Bank. 2004. Sri Lanka: Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate. Sri Lanka. ", "  3\nroads and lack of reliable power as the two primary hindrances to private sector development in \nthe country. The feasibility of establishing industrial zones with an efficient logistic distribution \nsystem for SMEs should be reviewed.  \n \n12.  SME Financing. A major impediment to SME growth is limited access to commercial \nfinancing (footnote 5). Cash-flow lending rather than collateral lending as well as alternative \nfinancial instruments to encourage banks and other financial institutions to fund sound SME \nprojects  will  improve  the  ability  of  SMEs  to  obtain  credit.  Also,  a  conducive  business \nenvironment (e.g., well-functioning credit bureau and small claims court) will stimulate financing \nto SMEs.  \n \n13.  The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has not been successful in attracting investors to \nprovide risk capital for SME growth. A well-functioning capital market would better serve the \nfinancial needs and economic growth of SMEs. \n \n14.  Business Support Services Facility. The BSSF component of SMESDP supported a \nmatching grant program to partially fund BDS for SMEs, and the establishment of five regional \nbusiness development centers to develop the capacity of BDS providers. Further outreach is \nneeded (i) especially in the non-urban/rural areas of the country, and (ii) for the development of \nwomen entrepreneurship to stimulate SME growth.  \n \n15.  Market Research and Marketing. SMESDP provided TA6 to develop a website to \nimprove SMEs\u2019 access to market research and marketing in the domestic market. The website \nneeds further improvement to include the global market.  \n \n16.  Lessons Learned. The SMESDP credit assistance loan amounting to $60 million was \navailable to all SMEs throughout the country. However, (i) over 50% was disbursed to SMEs \nlocated in the four major industrial areas in the western region rather than reaching out to the \nlesser developed, non-urban/rural areas of the country; and (ii) almost 80% of the loans were \nused  for  refinancing  existing  loans  rather  than  for  expansion  purposes.  Other  SME  credit \nassistance loans at favorable rates have been introduced in the market. The Japan Bank of \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) has provided three credit assistance SME loans, and an SME \nBank was recently established by the Government to provide loans to SMEs. Therefore, no \ncredit assistance loan is included in the TA.  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  Taking into account ongoing reforms in the SME sector, in part supported by SMESDP, \nthe proposed TA will further support as well as assist in implementing reforms and removing \nbarriers (paras. 3\u201315) to SME sector development.  \n \n18.  The TA will prepare the overall design and principal implementation components of \nSMESDP  II.  The  major  components  will  (i)  further  support  policy  reforms  for  growth  and \ndevelopment of SMEs, especially in the non-urban/rural areas; (ii) improve export trade, and in \nso doing, support improved quality, productivity, design and quality standards of Sri Lankan \ngoods; (iii) increase the availability and methods of financing and decrease the cost of financing \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

", "4   \nfor SMEs; and (iv) further strengthen the enabling business environment for SMEs. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n19.  The announced policy of the present Government elected in 2004 is to focus on SMEs. \nMany funding agencies have expressed interest in supporting SMEs. Except for JBIC, most \nother funding agencies have provided TA support and capacity building. As a collaborative \neffort, the TA and the structuring of the SMESDP II program loan will be implemented in close \nconsultation with stakeholders.7 The results of the Investment Climate Study (footnote 5) will \nalso be used as a basis for strengthening the enabling environment for SMEs.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n20.  The TA will engage international and domestic consultants who will work closely with the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, market participants, and ADB in the four areas: \n \n1.  Policy Reforms  \n \n21.  The TA will evaluate the regulatory constraints that negatively affect SME economic \ngrowth and recommend further policy reforms that can significantly improve the growth and \ndevelopment of SMEs. Areas to be addressed include (i) taxes, (ii) alternate dispute resolution \nprocedures, (iii) deregulation, (iv) the regulatory environment, and (v) Government services \navailable to SMEs. The TA will also evaluate possible assistance to the Government to improve \nthe implementation of SME policy and reform. \n \n2.  Increased Export Trade \n \n22.  The TA will (i) evaluate the major constraints in export trade, (ii) recommend methods of \nincreasing international exposure for SMEs, (iii) develop a plan to expand the usage of ISO \ncertification including ISO 14000 by Sri Lankan industry, (iv) recommend reforms to improve  \nthe  quality  and  design  of  goods  for  domestic  consumption  and  export  trade,  and  (v)  \nrecommend methods of implementing best-practice productivity on a sustainable basis. \n \n3.  Financing for Small and Medium Enterprises \n \n23.  Taking into account work already done by the Government, ADB, and other funding \nagencies, the TA will (i) explore how to improve SME access to finance especially in the non-\nurban/rural areas of the country; (ii) recommend methods, products and/or services that can be \nused as incentives for banks and other financial institutions to increase financing to SMEs; (iii) \nrecommend reforms to increase the availability of investment capital for SMEs, including the \nintroduction of modern insolvency provisions, strengthening the financial industry, harmonization \nof taxes and laws between various financial institutes and/or financial instruments; and  (iv) \nanalyze  trade  financing  activities  of  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  and  recommend \nchanges to support export trade.   \n \n \n                                                 \n7 The World Bank, JBIC, European Commission, German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Netherlands Government, \nRoyal  Norwegian Embassy  (Norad), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), United \nNations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID). ", "      5\n4.  Strengthening the Enabling Environment for Small and Medium Enterprises  \n \n24.  Taking into account work already performed by the Government, ADB, and other funding \nagencies,  the  TA  will  recommend  how  the  enabling  environment  should  be  improved  to \nstimulate SME growth, especially in the non-urban/rural areas of the country, and how the \nprivate sector can participate in implementing the recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n25.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $688,000 equivalent comprising $495,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $193,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $550,000 \nequivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $55,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost. The Government will contribute $138,000 equivalent to fund counterpart staff, \noffice facilities, and administrative services. The Government has been informed that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n    \n26.  The Ministry of Finance and Planning will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The \nMinistry  of  Advanced  Technology  and  National  Enterprise  Development  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency. The TA will be implemented over 5 months, from November 2005 to April \n2006. A team of five international consultants and five domestic consultants will provide a total \nof 21 person-months of consulting services. A team of international consultants from a firm will \nbe engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Domestic \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB. The selection of \nthe consultant firm will be based on the submission of a simplified technical proposal and \neffected by the quality- and cost-based selection process. An outline of the terms of reference is \nin Appendix 4. \n \n27.  In support of the TA activities, the Implementing Agency will provide (i) furnished office \nspace for the consultants, and access to a conference room; (ii) secretarial support; and (iii) \nlocal communication facilities for the consultants in Colombo. The Government will provide \ncounterpart staff, available on a part-time basis, as necessary. \n \n28.  The consultants will submit an inception report to the Government and ADB within 2 \nweeks of the start of work; an interim report\u2014midway through the engagement\u2014which would \nincorporate  a  draft  policy  matrix;  and  a  draft  final  report  2  weeks  before  the  end  of  the \nengagement. The interim and draft final reports will be discussed at a tripartite meeting involving \nthe Government, the consultants, and ADB. The final report will incorporate results from the \nmeeting and be made available 2 weeks from the date of the meeting. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  for  preparing  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector \nDevelopment Program II, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

The  TA  will  focus  on  further  support  of  policy  reforms  for  growth  and \ndevelopment of SMEs, especially in the non-urban/rural areas. Reforms will involve improving export trade, increasing \nthe availability and reducing the cost of financial sources, and further strengthening the enabling environment, thereby \nreducing the vulnerability of the poor. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Program is indirectly pro-poor in supporting the three components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor \nsustainable economic growth, good governance, and social development. Pro-poor sustainable economic growth is to \nbe achieved through the Program\u2019s focus on measures to improve SME economic growth and development, including \nthe non-urban/rural areas, with the highest incidence of poverty in the country. Economic growth and development \nhave been stagnant in the non-urban/rural areas. To support good governance, the Program will focus on policy \nreforms and improving the enabling environment, which will ultimately support sustainable economic development. \nAlso, by focusing on the availability and cost of financing, it will be easier for more people, including women who \ngenerally receive no wages as household workers, to establish new SMEs or expand existing SMEs, thereby \nimproving livelihood, employment possibilities, and social development. \n \n \nC.
