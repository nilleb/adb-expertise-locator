INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Indonesia (the government) has identified social security reform as a \nmeans to achieve inclusive growth under its second medium-term growth strategy for 2010\u2013\n2014. The government\u2019s objective is to expand the coverage and improve the quality of the \nexisting social security framework to cover all Indonesian citizens, regardless of their income \nstatus. The government has initiated the reform process by passing Law No. 40 on National \nSocial Security System in 2004 (SJSN Law) and Law No. 24 on Social Security Administering \nBodies (BPJS) in 2011 (BPJS Law). The Health BPJS should be established by early 2014 \nwhile the BPJS for labor should be established by mid 2015. To meet these deadlines, the \ngovernment will need support in preparing all related regulations, studies, and institutional \narrangements.1 \n \n2.  Lessons from other countries indicate that social security reform is a long-term process \nrequiring focus and an appropriate sequencing of steps. The reforms must be credible, scalable, \nand acceptable to diverse stakeholders. Good organization and sound design are essential but \neven the best designed program will fail if the government does not establish appropriate and \neffective business processes, administrative systems, and information management capabilities. \nAbove  all,  it  is  critical  that  the  government  adopts  a  sustainable  contribution  and  benefit \nstructure. \n \n3.  Since 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported social security reform in \nIndonesia through technical assistance (TA) and program loans.2 The TA3 was listed in the \ncountry operations business plan for 2011\u20132013.4 ADB support in reforming the social security \nsystem in Indonesia is aligned with ADB\u2019s social protection strategy that aims to reduce poverty \nand the vulnerability of the poor to sudden economic shocks.5 The government also views social \nsecurity reform as a part of its National Poverty Reduction Agenda. To maintain the momentum \nand ensure the reforms are effective, the government has requested ADB capacity development \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the  creation  and  launch  of  the  two  social  security \nadministering bodies. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.     ISSUES \n \n4.  The current social security system is managed by four state-owned enterprises\u2014PT. \nTASPEN, PT. ASKES, PT. ASABRI, and PT. JAMSOSTEK. The pension and endowment \nbenefits of civil servants and their dependents, which total 13 million, are covered by PT. \nTASPEN. PT. ASKES provides health insurance to about 14 million civil servants and their \ndependents.  PT.  ASABRI  provides  pension  and  death  benefits to  about  1.5 million  active \nmembers  of  armed  forces,  while  PT.  JAMSOSTEK  provides  old-age  savings,  worker\u2019s \n                                                \n1  The required regulations cover at least 8 Government regulations/PP, 7 Presidential Regulation/Perpres, and 1 \nPresidential Decree, which should be enacted for BPJS for Health. \n2  ADB. 1998.

Coverage \nfor the poor is limited to health through the government's program on social health assistance \n(JAMKESMAS).6 The informal sector is not currently covered by any plan. Thus, the current \nsocial security system is limited and covers only 12% of the total workforce. \n \n5.  The government is mandated by BPJS Law to establish two social security administering \nbodies (BPJS) on health and labor. The administrative body on health will be responsible for \nimplementing  national  health  insurance,  while  the  administrative  body  for  labor  will  be \nresponsible for programs that are related to pension, old-age savings, death, and accident \nbenefits. \n \n6.  The implementation of the two social security administering bodies entail consolidating \nall health and pension programs provided by the four current social security organizations. All \nhealth programs provided by PT. ASKES and PT. JAMSOSTEK will be consolidated into the \nnew administrative body on health. The new administrative body on labor, on the other hand, \nwould consolidate all the current old-age savings and accidental benefits programs provided by \nPT. JAMSOSTEK and PT. ASABRI. It will also create a new pension scheme. During the \ntransition stage, the government is required to migrate the participants, programs, assets and \nliabilities,  employees,  and  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  four  current  social  security \norganizations to BPJS. The government understands that implementation will be challenging \nand will require a gradual approach over time.  \n \nA.  Lack of Capacity for Administering Social Security  \n \n7.  The success of any social security administering body depends on its ability to reliably \ncollect  contributions  and  pay  benefits  to  the  participants  in  a  timely  manner.  The  new \nadministering  bodies  have  not  yet  developed  an  effective  communication  and  information \nnetwork, including accurate data and record keeping that will support routine activities such as \ncollections and payments. Such systems are a prerequisite to preparing financial statements \nthat are transparent and provide for accountability. \n \nB.  High Administrative and Compliance Costs \n \n8.  High costs hamper the government\u2019s current system and adversely affect its operations. \nCurrently, administrative costs represent approximately 40% of the contributions made by the \nparticipants. In mature and  well-run  social  security  systems,  administrative  costs generally \naccount  for  less  than  one  percent  of  contribution  collections  (or  benefits  payments).  It  is \nessential to lower administrative and compliance costs to enable the social security system to \nprovide greater benefits to its participants.  \n \nC.  Lack of Credible Cost Projections  \n \n9.  The primary goal of social security reform is to provide a social security system that is \nadequate, sustainable, affordable, and robust. The reforms should also assist the government in \nimplementing  their  welfare-improving  initiatives.  However,  the  2004  SJSN  law  was  not \nsupported by a body of analytical work sufficient to design the regulations needed to implement \nthe legislation. No credible projections are available to help model the pension systems. For \nexample,  the  government  has  not  prepared  a  forward-looking  analysis  of  the  country\u2019s \ndemographics, labor market, and economic structure including key parameters such as future \nwages, labor market participation, and investment returns. The same problem is noted in the \n                                                \n6 JAMKESMAS provides social health assistance to 72 million poor. \n ", "3 \n \nplanning  for  health  services  as  information  on  the  system\u2019s  current  costs  have  not  been \ncollected  and  systematically  analyzed.  The  assessments  of  costs  for  treating  non-\ncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and tobacco poisoning are \nincomplete and need to be refined. Likewise, a long-term analysis of the fiscal implications of \nsocial security reform will be important for the government, and in particular the Ministry of \nFinance, to determine the level of sustainability and robustness of the new social security \nsystem.  \n \nD.  Limited Fiscal Space \n \n10.  The limited fiscal space in Indonesia makes it difficult for the Ministry of Finance to \nensure the sustainability of funding for social security reform. Policy makers need to choose a \nbenefit package that is adequate and affordable. The new program will have to strike a balance \nbetween providing protection against catastrophic events and the financial resources that will be \navailable to it. The problem for universal coverage also involves the readiness of the supply \nside, particularly in remote areas.  \n \n E.  Large Number of Informal Sector Workers  \n \n11.  The Center Bureau of Statistics estimated informal employment to be about 64% of the \ntotal labor force in 2006. According to an ADB study, the output of small enterprises, most of \nwhich are assumed to be informal, account for approximately 62% of gross domestic product.7 \nCurrently, about 70% of Indonesia\u2019s workers are employed in the informal sector, mostly in \nagriculture and construction, and mainly in rural areas. ADB studies indicate that women are \ntwice as likely as men to be employed in the informal sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n12.  The TA will help the government establish the two main BPJS. The TA will also provide \ndirect support to BPJS to strengthen the administration of its core functions, including: (i) \ncollecting member contributions, (ii) paying benefits for health and pension in a timely manner, \n(iii) managing plan assets in a proper and effective manner, (iv) keeping records through an \nefficient system, and (v) implementing and abiding by a reliable system of governance. The TA \nwill  also  help  BPJS  incorporate  the  lessons  and  experiences  of  other  countries.  The  TA \nactivities  will be coordinated with other development partners  in support of social security \nreform. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has expressed interest in assisting the \ngovernment in social security reform and on social safety net issues. The World Bank has been \nproviding assistance to the Ministry of Finance related to civil servant pensions and savings \nprograms.  German  development  cooperation  through  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit (GIZ) has been supporting the National Development Planning Agency in \nsetting up a road map for implementing universal basic coverage for health. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the TA will be an increased number of participants of the social security \nadministering bodies. The outcome will be the establishment of the social security administering \nbodies.  \n \n \n                                                \n7  Government of Indonesia, National Statistic Agency, 2012. Berita Resmi Statistik No. 33/05/Th. XV, 7 Mei 2012: \nKeadaan Ketenagakerjaan Februari 2012. Jakarta. \n ", "4   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will support the transformation of the current social security operators into two \nsocial security administering bodies on health and labor. The TA will help the government in \nassessing the financial viability of the new bodies, prepare actuarial projections, and make \nrecommendations to improve the scope of coverage and fiscal sustainability of the reforms. The \nTA will also recommend new business processes and procedures for the new social security \nadministering bodies. This will include recommendations on a new system for collection and \npayments, and capacity building for policy formulation and implementation. In addition, the \nmanagement and development of assets of the social security administering bodies as well as \nassets of trust funds owned by participants (Dana Jaminan Social) need to be clearly defined.  \n \n15.  Output 1: Administration plan to implement social security programs in the social \nsecurity administering bodies is completed. The TA will help the government to design an \nadministration plan for the establishment of the social security administering bodies. The Law \nNo. 24 mandates that PT. ASKES will be transformed as the social security administering body \nin the beginning of 2014 and PT. JAMSOSTEK will be transformed as the social security \nadministering  body  for  pension  in  2015.  The  transition  requires  a  revamp  of  the  existing \nadministration policy in the two social security companies. The new social security body will \nhandle  all  the  major  functions,  including  collection  of  revenue  and  payment  of  benefits. \nExperiences of other countries show that a high level of administrative efficiency is essential to \nreduce  compliance  cost.  Social  security  arrangements  that  are  well  administered  at  a \nreasonable cost will gain more legitimacy and wider support than those that are inefficiently run \nand  perceived  as  unnecessarily  expensive.  The  TA  will  help  the  new  social  security \nadministering bodies reduce and maintain their administrative and compliance costs at the most \nefficient levels possible. Cost savings in administration will translate into higher rates of return to \nmembers. In addition, lower compliance costs and statutory levies for employers and employees \nhave a positive impact on labor markets because they reduce the real burden of statutory levies. \nThey do not discourage firms from hiring more employees.  \n \n16.  Output 2: Analytic work on the financial management of universal health program \nis produced. The key to building a sustainable social security program is the level of funds or \nfunds management. With a larger pool of available funds, a larger percentage of the population \ncan be covered, and a more comprehensive service package can be provided while minimizing \nthe cost borne by the participants. Often times, governments face a situation wherein funding is \nlimited while health service costs continue to rise due to growth in the population and evolving \nhealth technology. To ensure that the new social security system is affordable, adequate, \nsustainable, and robust, the TA will examine the existing system and provide an analysis to \nimprove  health  insurance  management  and  the  fiscal  governance  of  the  new  system.  In \naddition, the TA will analyze the costs of incorporating informal sector workers and will provide \nalternatives to contain costs at the micro and macro levels.  \n \n17.  Output  3:  Good  governance  framework  for  asset  liability  management  is \nestablished. The quality of investment outcomes is linked to, and affected by the quality of \ngovernance structures. The impact of this linkage can be substantial. The costs of investment \nmanagement are as important as investment returns because they directly affect the value of \npensions. The factors that contribute to good governance within social security administration \ninclude governance structures, well-defined accountabilities, policies, and procedures, and the \nprocesses used to select and supervise governing bodies and managing institutions. The TA will \nassist the new administrative bodies to set up an investment policy framework that can control \nthe fiscal burden of the social service programs.  \n \n ", "5 \n \n18.  Output 4: Long-term fiscal risk analysis on the implementation of the National \nSocial  Security  Programs  (SJSN)  is  completed.  Indonesia  is  currently  in  a  strong \ndemographic position with 50% of its labor force below the age of 30. However, the country\u2019s \ndemographic dividend will not last long. As the economy grows, the birth rate is expected to \ndrop due to the improvements in medical facilities. This will increase life expectancy. With more \npeople aging, the dependency ratio, or the ratio of people of nonworking age compared to the \nnumber of those of working age, will also increase, and thus increase the future fiscal cost of \ncaring for the elderly through a social insurance scheme. The TA will provide an updated fiscal \nrisk analysis using recent population survey data. The inputs will be important for developing a \nfiscal risk reserve fund that will need to be incorporated in the national budget. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space and housing accommodation, \ndomestic  transportation,  communications  facilities  for  consultants,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The Fiscal Policy Office of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency due to its \nmandate to improve fiscal risk management. The implementing agencies will be the Fiscal \nPolicy  Office,  which  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  new  social  security \nadministering bodies, and the Directorate General of Budget of the Ministry of Finance, which is \nresponsible for allocating the government budget for the new social security system. The project \nis expected to start on 3 September 2012 and end on 2 September 2014.  \n \n21.  ADB will hire individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will conform \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). A total of 44 person-months of consulting services (17 international and 27 national) will \nbe required. The consultants will assist the government in the implementation of the social \nsecurity  administering  bodies  for  health  and  pension.  All  procurement  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Any \nequipment purchased under the TA will be handed over to the government upon completion of \nthe project. All consultant reports and deliverables required under their terms of references will \nbe  delivered  to  the  executing  agency  at  the  end  of  the TA. The  consultant  team  will  be \nresponsible for disseminating the reports to the implementing agencies with the help of the \nexecuting agency. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Fiscal \nAspect of Social Security Reform, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6     Appendix 1   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions  \nSummary  Baseline  and Risks  \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumption \nIncreased number of  Coverage of publicly  Central Bureau of  The government is \nparticipants of the  provided social security  Statistics and the social  committed to social \nsocial security  system increased from  security administrators\u2019  security reform. \nadministering bodies   108 million persons in  data   \n2010 to 150 million    Risks \npersons.
