The deteriorating fiscal \nposition since fiscal year (FY) 1998 has impeded both central and \nstate governments in their efforts to effectively finance desirable \npublic investment and provide social sector expenditure to foster \npoverty reduction. To successfully achieve fiscal and governance \nreforms, the state governments must join the central Government \nin addressing fiscal imbalance problems as the states collectively \naccount for about half of the country\u2019s aggregate fiscal deficit.  \n \nThe Assam state government (ASG) faces fiscal and governance-\nrelated structural problems; its limited infrastructure endowment \nlags most Indian states. The state\u2019s fiscal position is weak due to \nstagnation  of  tax  and  nontax  revenues  and  growing  revenue \nexpenditures.  ASG  must  also  contend  with  high  interest  debt, \nrising  government  wage  and  salary  expenditure,  and  pension \nliabilities. The several public sector enterprises (PSEs) that are \nloss making impose a considerable budgetary burden, suppress \ncompetition, and deter private sector participation.  \n \nASG is therefore facing increasing fiscal stress from mounting and \nunsustainable fiscal deficits and concomitant large public debt. \nWithout  meaningful  fiscal  stabilization  and  consolidation,  and \ngovernance reforms to promote efficiencies and plug leakages, \ndeteriorating fiscal imbalances and governance deficiencies will \nincreasingly erode physical and human capital expenditures and \ncrowd  out  private  investment.  This  will  prevent  Assam  from \nreaching  its  potential  growth  in  a  sustainable  fashion.  To \nsuccessfully  fulfill its  development  objectives,  including poverty \nreduction, ASG must address its fiscal imbalances and enhance \ngovernance efficiencies. ", "ii  \n   \n     Objective   The Program supports ASG\u2019s stabilization and consolidation of \n  state  finances  to  enhance  growth  and  reduce  poverty  by \nstrengthening  public  finances;  fiscal  governance;  and  core \ngovernance  through  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nreforms. \n   \n     Components and    The  Program  will  support  reform  measures  under  three \n     Output  components:  (i)  reform  of  state  finances,  (ii)  reform  of  fiscal \ngovernance, and (iii) reorientation of the role of the state. The \nfollowing  outcomes  are  expected:  (i)  enhanced  fiscal \nresponsibility,  (ii)  broadened  tax  base  and  enhanced  tax \ncollection, (iii) enhanced nontax revenues, (iv) restructured state \ndebt,  (v)  containment  of  state  pension  liabilities,  (vi)  improved \nstate  budgeting,  (vii)  enhanced  poverty-focused  and  growth-\noriented expenditure, (viii) public sector enterprise reforms, (ix) \nstrengthened  public-private  partnership,  and  (x)  public \nadministration review. \n   \n     Financing Plan  The  Program  includes  the  program  cluster  modality  and \n  comprises two subprograms with a combined lending volume of \n  up to $225 million for the program cluster.  \n \nUnder subprogram 1, a loan of $125 million from the ordinary \ncapital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term including \na  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nUnder the subsequent subprogram 2, which will be presented for \nconsideration  and  approval  by  the  ADB  Board  based  on \nimplementation  progress  with  subprogram  1,  a  loan  of  $100 \nmillion from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will be provided \nunder  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  be \nprovided in two equal installments of $50 million each under terms \nand conditions prescribed by ADB and approved by the Board.  \n   \n     Program Period   Subprogram 1 will be implemented over 2.5 years from December \n     and Tranching  2004 to June 2007. The loan will be released in three installments: \n$45 million in the first tranche, $45 million in an incentive tranche, \nand $35 million in a second tranche. The first tranche will be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness. The incentive tranche will be \nreleased  subject  to  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  tranche \nrelease  conditions.  The  second  tranche  is  expected  to  be \nreleased  within  24  months  from  release  of  the  first  tranche, \nsubject  to  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  tranche  release \nconditions. \n \nSubprogram 2 is expected to be implemented over 2 years from ", "  iii\nDecember 2007 to December 2009. The loan is expected to be \nreleased in two installments of $50 million each in FY2008 and \nFY2010. \n   \n     Estimated Program    December 2009 \n     Cluster Completion   \n     Date \n   \n     Executing Agency   The Executing Agency for the Program will be the ASG Finance \n     and Implementation   Department. A program steering committee will be responsible for \n     Arrangements  overall  coordination,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  policy \napprovals of the Program; and will assist the Finance Department. \nThe committee will be chaired by the chief secretary, include all \nprincipal  secretaries  and  commissioners  of  participating \ndepartments and the Finance Department, and report to the chief \nminister and the Cabinet.  \n \nA  State-Level  Empowered  Committee  will  monitor  public \nadministration reform requirements under the Program. It will be \nchaired by an additional chief secretary and include all principal \nsecretaries and commissioners of departments incurring material \npublic expenditure. A PSE reform committee will be responsible \nfor monitoring the progress of PSE reforms under the Program. It \nwill  be  chaired  by  an  additional  chief  secretary  and  include \nrepresentatives of the Department of Public Enterprises, Finance \nDepartment, and PSEs. The Department of Public Enterprises will \nact as the nodal agency for PSE reforms and secretariat to the \nPSE reform committee. A public-private partnership task force, \ncomprising representatives of labor, management, private sector, \ncivil society, and ASG, will report to the PSE reform committee. \n \nASG will establish a fiscal management unit (FMU) in the Finance \nDepartment  under  the  steering  committee.  The  FMU  will \nundertake management of fiscal responsibility, debt, and central \ntransfers,  and  be  responsible  for  daily  implementation  of  the \nProgram under the guidance of the steering committee. The FMU \nwill coordinate with ADB and various stakeholders and regularly \nsolicit feedback from experts from within and outside Assam.  \n \nThe FMU will have five reform cells: revenue reform, expenditure \nreform, budget reform, pension reform, and debt management. \nTheir responsibilities are outlined in the policy matrix.  \n   \n     Procurement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program \nloan will be disbursed to India as the Borrower. No supporting \nimport  documentation  will  be  required, if  during  each  year that ", "iv   \n  loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of India\u2019s \ntotal imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The  central \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with each \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under \nexisting procedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the \ncentral Government\u2019s certification. Loan proceeds may be used to \nfinance eligible imports for which expenditures were incurred 180 \ndays before the loan becomes effective. \n   \n     Counterpart Funds  The  rupee  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan \nproceeds will be transferred by the central Government to ASG. \nThe counterpart proceeds will be treated as an addition to the \ntransfers allocated annually from the central Government to ASG \nand will be provided on a grant-loan ratio of 90:10. \nThe Project Loan   \n      Objective  The  project  loan  will  provide  (i)  procurement  of  equipment \nrequired to develop and implement an integrated public financial \nmanagement  information  system  for  institutional  strengthening; \nand (ii) capacity building to support ASG\u2019s fiscal and governance \nreform efforts to strengthen its implementation of processes and \nprocedures  outlined  in  the  Program  through  engagement  of \nconsulting services, increased public awareness, and training.  \n   \n     Components and      The specific components are (i) coordination, (ii) capacity building \n     Outputs  for  reform  of  state  finances,  (iii)  capacity  building  for  fiscal \ngovernance reforms, (iv) capacity building for reorienting the role \nof the state, (v) public finance information technology, (vi) training \nprograms, and (vii) public awareness programs. \n \n     Financing Plan  A loan of $25 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement.  \n   \n     Executing Agency   The ASG Finance Department will be the Executing Agency. The \n     and Implementation   Finance Department\u2019s FMU will support project implementation \n     Arrangements  and be responsible for coordination with ASG departments and \ntimely implementation of the Project. A project manager, who will \nbe  appointed  for  the  FMU  reporting  to  the  program  steering \ncommittee, will have the authority to make decisions, essential to \nensuring  project  progress  and  to  facilitate  procurement  of \nequipment and recruitment of consulting services.  \n   \n   \n   ", "  v\n     Procurement and   Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \n     Consulting   ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Expenditure procedures will \n     Services  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nConsultants to be financed from the project loan will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  recruitment  of \ndomestic  consultants.  A  total  of  153  person-months  of \ninternational  and  306  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \ninputs will be required.  \n \nConsulting services for the Project\u2019s coordination component (the \ncoordination consultants) will be provided by a firm through the \nquality-based selection method or individual consultants recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement \nof  domestic  consultants  given  the  specialized  nature  of  the \nassignment in undertaking 30% of the total person-months of the \nconsulting  services  for  all  project  components,  facilitating \nrecruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement,  and  managing \nconsultants.  Consulting  services  recruited  for  other  project \ncomponents  by  the  coordination  consultants  will  be  provided \nthrough the quality and cost-based selection method by one or \nmore  consulting  firms  or  individual  consultants  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  If  firms  are  to  be  selected,  simplified \ntechnical proposals will be used where possible and appropriate.  \n \n     Benefits and     The Program is expected to strengthen the fiscal and governance \n     Beneficiaries  positions of ASG. ASG will have additional resources available to \nbetter translate priority spending to increase growth and ultimately \nreduce  poverty.  ASG  will  be  able  to  reorient  existing  public \nexpenditures to capital outlay and maintenance, which will help \nunderpin growth. The Program will help discontinue unproductive \nsubsidies for the public sector, enable poverty-targeted subsidies, \nand  improve  the  quality  of  public  expenditures.  Together  this \nshould positively affect the livelihood of the more than 26 million \nwho live in Assam\u201436% are poor.  \n \nIdentifiable benefits will accrue over the medium term in line with \noutcomes detailed in the program framework and policy matrix.  \n \nSpecific and immediate benefits include restructured state debt. In \naddition, several specific actions are directly targeted at the poor, \nsuch as user fees with targeted protection for the poor.  \n \nThe impact on beneficiaries in the population in terms of the labor \nmarkets, prices, access to public goods and services, and public \ntransfers should be positive over time. \n   \n     Risks and   Political Risks. Assam has experienced a series of political and \n     Safeguards  social challenges during the last 5 to 6 decades. The state has ", "vi   \nshown great resilience in the face of insurgency accentuated by \nthe partition of the country in 1947, demographic changes and \nreorganization  of  the  state  in  1972  against  a  backdrop  of \neconomic  deceleration.  The  Program  will  provide  a \ncomplementary  growth-oriented  program  to  the  steps  already \ntaken by ASG to contain insurgency, and law and order problems \nthrough the Assam Accord of 1985 and the recent Bodo Accord of \nFebruary 2003.  \n \nThe  Program\u2019s  policy  actions  are  structured  through  first  and \nincentive tranches to achieve critical results early given the state \nelectoral  calendar  in  2006.  In  addition,  the  accomplishment  of \nsubprogram  1  second  tranche  policy  actions  after  the  state \nelections will set the stage for deepening of policy reforms in \nsubprogram 2.   \n \nTo  mitigate  the  risks  of  misinformation  and  lack  of  clear \ncommunication  about  the  implications  of  the  Program  for  key \nstakeholders, the Program includes measures to build consensus \nand  strong  stakeholder  support  through  a  comprehensive \ncommunications  strategy,  including  an  annual  Assam \ndevelopment  forum.  The  Project  specifically  addresses  public \nawareness. \n \nBureaucratic Risks. The Program aims to increase transparency \nthrough fiscal and governance reforms; and enhance government \nperformance,  accountability,  responsiveness,  and  vigilance \nthrough core governance reforms. To mitigate any opposition to \nthe reform process, strong ownership at the highest political and \nbureaucratic  levels  has  been  built  into  the  Program  and  its \nimplementation arrangements. In addition, the Project will build \ncapacity to support reform champions within the system. \n \nInstitutional  Risks.  The  Program\u2019s  comprehensive  nature  will \nplace considerable demands on the modest institutional capacity \nof ASG, which has limited experience with this type of fiscal and \ngovernance reform program. The Project will provide significant \ncapacity building and systems support, and include performance \nbenchmarks to track institutional performance.  \n \nImplementation Risks. Close performance monitoring will help \nreduce  the  adverse  effects  of  implementation  delays  due  to \ncapacity constraints. The FMU will draw on lessons learned from \nother  programs.  Implementation  delays  caused  by  frequent \nchanges of personnel will be mitigated through assurances on \ncontinuity and by the Project\u2019s capacity building. \n \nLegislative Risks. Risks of delay in legislative enactment may \narise.  These  will,  to  the  extent  possible,  be  mitigated  through \npolicy  commitment,  prior  institutional  actions,  and  public \nawareness, which will propel the critical substantive content of \nreforms. ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on  (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster concept for the Assam Governance and Public Resource Management Sector \nDevelopment Program (AGPRM SDP); (ii) a proposed loan to India for subprogram 1 of the \nAGPRM SDP; and (iii) a proposed loan to India for the Assam Governance and Public Resource \nManagement Project to support implementation of AGPRM SDP policy reforms.  \n \nII.  MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Sustainability of Recent Economic Performance. The recent economic performance \nof India has been impressive with gross domestic product (GDP) growth more than doubling to \n8.2% in fiscal year (FY) 2004 as compared with 4.0% in FY2003. The key question is whether \nthis high growth is sustainable. The downside risks during the current year include the still \ninadequate progress in fiscal consolidation at the center as well as by the states.1 Inadequate \nfiscal consolidation by the states has the potential to undermine the sustainability of recent \neconomic  performance  and  the  delivery  of  promised  economic  prospects.  Given  the  state \ngovernments\u2019 demands for funds, the national economy is more prone to higher interest rates \nand to crowding out private investment. The high percentage of revenue deficit in the state fiscal \ndeficit,2 primarily due to wages, salaries, pensions, and interest payments, limits government \nspending on education, health, and infrastructure, and means that the burden of fiscal deficit \ncorrection  tends  to  fall  on  public  investment.  This  does  not  allow  government  to  address \nconstraints to economic growth caused by inadequate infrastructure and poor social indicators.  \n \n3.  Development in Assam. Assam is the largest of the seven states3 in the northeast of \nIndia. It has 2.6% (or 26.6 million) of India\u2019s population spread over 2.4% of the country\u2019s area \n(78,438 square kilometers). Assam\u2019s development is of particular significance as a gateway for \ndevelopment  of  the  northeast  given  both  its  relative  size,  and  its  position  as  a  center  of \ninterstate trade and integrated infrastructure in the northeast. Assam is rich in natural resources, \nincluding substantial forest resources;4 produces 54% of India\u2019s tea production; and produces \nover 5 million tons of crude oil a year, making it India\u2019s leading producer of crude oil. The long \nBrahmaputra river basin running through the state serves as its lifeline. The state is prone to \nflooding and earthquakes, and is geographically isolated. The central Government explicitly \nrecognized these unique geographic, natural, and exogenous constraints on Assam\u2019s capacity \nto develop by granting the state the status of Special Category State and extending assistance \non a grant-loan ratio of 90:10.  \n \n4.  Despite  its  natural  resources  and  special  status,  Assam  is  lagging  in  terms  of \ndevelopment. This becomes apparent through a comparative examination of a number of key \ndevelopment indicators such as growth, per capita income, poverty ratios, and unemployment. \nAs economic liberalization in the 1990s has taken the nation and some other states on a higher \ngrowth trajectory, Assam has recorded slow economic growth. During the 9th Five Year Plan \nperiod  (1997\u20132002),  India\u2019s  GDP  grew  at  5.4%,  while  Assam\u2019s  corresponding  gross  state \ndomestic product (GSDP) growth was only 2.1%. In per capita income terms, while per capita \nincome in Assam in FY1951 was Rs1,173 as compared with Rs1,127 for India (i.e., Assam\u2019s per \n                                                 \n1  The combined gross fiscal deficit of the central and state governments remains high at 10% of GDP. About half of \nthis fiscal deficit may be attributed to the central Government with most of the rest attributable to the fiscal \nprofligacy of the states. \n2  Currently, the percentage of revenue deficit in the fiscal deficit is 62%. \n3  These states are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura. \n4  The total area under forest in Assam at the end of March 2001 was 267,781 square kilometers, about 34.14% of \nthe total geographic area. Forest products mainly comprise industrial wood, fuelwood, bamboo, and thatched cane.  ", "2  \ncapita income was 104.1% of India\u2019s), Assam\u2019s per capita income as a percentage of the all-\nIndia per capita income declined to 55.4%, an alarming trend. Over 40% of the rural population \nlive below the poverty line,5 and over 36% of the total population do so in Assam; this compares \nunfavorably with national poverty levels. The poverty ratio of Assam as of FY2000 was 36.09% \ncompared  with  26.10%  for  India.  Furthermore,  low  economic  growth  has  meant  a  slower \nreduction  in  poverty  in  Assam  compared  with  India  as  a  whole.6  Finally,  in  terms  of \nunemployment, the slow growth of the economy together with the rapid growth of population \nand declining job creation7 have given rise to a serious unemployment problem in the state. As \nof FY2002, the number of unemployed per 1,000 was 21 in rural areas and 20 in urban areas in \nAssam as compared with 5 in rural areas and 14 in urban areas in India.8 Against this economic \nbackdrop, the tribal diversity, and the inherent and immigration accentuated ethnic mix of the \nstate9 have made it prone to indigenous and tribal unrest. The insurgency movements of the \n1980s and 1990s cast a shadow on Assam\u2019s development. In light of these facts, any progress \nin addressing Assam\u2019s developmental lag can be expected to complement steps taken to \ncontain insurgency in the form of the Assam Accord of 1985 and the Bodo Accord of 2003, and \nalleviate the development of \u201ctwo Indias\u201d in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n5.  Fiscal Constraints. The critical factors for Assam\u2019s developmental lag are found in the \nfiscal and governance constraints of the state. Fiscal trends for Assam show that the average \nrevenue and fiscal deficits were significantly higher in the 1990s than in the 1980s. This was \nprimarily due to the sharp increase in revenue expenditures,10 especially following the pay and \npension revisions in FY2000 resulting from the central Government\u2019s Fifth Pay Commission \nrecommendation. Thus, as a ratio of GSDP, the fiscal deficit deteriorated sharply to 5.68% in \nFY2000.11 The trend was similar for revenue deficits, which deteriorated to 3.55% in FY2000, \nafter the pay and pensions revision.12  \n \n6.  From FY2001 to FY2003, fiscal and revenue deficits improved to 3.1% and 1.41% \nrespectively with indications that this trend is continuing in FY2004.13 However, despite the \nimprovement in the revenue deficit and fiscal deficit indicators, the underlying picture is troubling \nbecause the increasing pressure to spend on revenue expenditures has crowded out capital \nexpenditures. While revenue expenditures grew at more than 12% per annum during FY1992 to \nFY2002,14 capital expenditure declined from 2.34% of GSDP in FY1992 to 1.4% of GSDP in \n                                                 \n5  The cut-off expenditure for Assam poverty according to the Planning Commission is Rs365.43 per capita per \nmonth for FY2000 in rural areas and Rs343.99 per capita per month for urban areas. \n6  In Assam, the poverty ratio declined from 40.86% in FY1994 to 36.09% in FY2000. In comparison, the national \npoverty ratio declined from 35.97% in FY1994 to 26.10% in FY2000. \n7  While the decadal population growth in Assam according to the 2001 census was 1.73%, the growth in workers \nwas only 0.13%.  \n8  Given the remoteness of certain parts of Assam, the number of registered unemployed may be understated. \n9  In 1947, the state of Assam consisted of the entire northeast represented today by seven states in the northeast. \n10  Revenue expenditures include current expenditures on salaries, pensions, and interest, and exclude capital \nexpenditures.  \n11  The fiscal deficit was 1.03% in FY1999. \n12 The revenue deficit was 2.21% in FY1992. \n13  A comparison between the all-states average and Assam on revenue deficit and fiscal deficit shows a steeper \ndeterioration in Assam than the all-state average as a result of the pay revision (FY2000) and a catching up of \nAssam to the fairly stagnant all-state average thereafter (FY2001 to FY2003).  \n14  The secular deterioration in revenue expenditure in the 1980s and 1990s was transformed into a state fiscal crisis \nas a result of the pay and pensions revision in FY2000. Thus, salaries as a ratio of own revenues rose from 147% \nin FY1994 to 258% in FY2000. ", "  3\nFY2003  with  adverse  effects  on  infrastructure  availability.15  This  has  had  adverse \nconsequences for growth. While the growth rate of GSDP in the 1990s accelerated in the rest of \nthe country, it declined in Assam. The real growth of GSDP at about 2% per annum compares \npoorly with the 5.4% growth in GDP in the country during the 1990s. \n \n7.  Alongside galloping revenue expenditures, the state also suffered a slowdown in the \ngrowth  of  revenues.  The  stagnancy  of  the  state  economy  is  one  of  the  reasons  for  a \ndecelerating effect on revenues16 even though buoyancy17 of the state\u2019s own taxes continued to \nbe above unity. The state\u2019s own revenue finances less than one third of total public expenditure \n(current expenditure and capital outlay) with central transfers contributing to the remaining two \nthirds. Despite the fact that state\u2019s tax effort has improved,18 this basic imbalance limits the \nextent to which fiscal consolidation can be accomplished through reforms on the revenue side of \nthe budget.  \n \n8.  The major taxes in Assam, including sales tax, state excise duty, vehicle taxes, stamp \nduty, and registration fees and land revenue, exhibit divergent trends. The bulk of revenue \ncomes from sales tax and state excise duties.19 Average growth rates of stamps, registration \nfees, and agricultural income tax declined in the 1990s when compared with the 1980s; while \nthose of sales tax, state excise, and taxes on vehicles increased. However, sales tax registered \nonly a marginal rise in growth. Although growth of the state economy has been slow, much of \nGSDP growth in recent years has been in the services sector, a large proportion of which is not \nincluded in the tax base. In addition to such structural issues, administrative and compliance \nissues have been major factors in the decelerating trend in the growth of key taxes. Most of the \nneighboring states in the northeast have acted as tax havens, resulting in significant evasion \nand avoidance of taxes.  \n \n9.  Nontax revenue was virtually stagnant in the 1990s. The average growth rate of nontax \nrevenues declined from 17% during the 1980s to a mere 4% during the 1990s. The growth of \npetroleum royalty, which contributed 77% of the total nontax revenue in FY2003, does not depend \non state action; and receipts from forestry, which were a significant source, lost their importance \nfollowing the judgment of the Supreme Court banning the felling of trees. However, the Assam \nstate government (ASG) has failed to effectively tap other nontax revenue sources, which do fall \nwithin  the  realm  of  state  policy  making.  While  the  expenditure  on  most  public  services  has \nmaintained a rising trend, the inertia of successive state governments to revise fees, tariffs, rents, \nand royalties linked to affordability and service quality has led to the corresponding revenues from \nthose services not keeping pace, and very low recovery rates, even compared with the national \naverage.20  \n \n10.  The sharp increase in Assam\u2019s revenue expenditures alongside slowing revenue growth \ncould only be supported by higher borrowings by ASG. This led to increasing indebtedness, \ngrowing from 24% of GSDP in FY1996 to 36% in FY2002.21 The increasing levels of debt have \n                                                 \n15  Assam\u2019s infrastructure index in 1999 was only 72.7 compared with the all-India average of 100. \n16 State tax revenues declined in annual growth rate from 16.8% in 1981\u20131991 to 13% in 1992\u2013 2002. \n17 Buoyancy represents the percentage change in tax collections associated with a 1% change in the tax base \n(typically GSDP). \n18 The share of own tax revenue to GSDP ratio increased from 3.1% in FY1982 to 5.3% in FY2003. \n19 In FY2003, sales tax formed 74.45% of own tax revenues, state excise formed 6.3%, taxes on vehicles amounted \nto 6%, stamp duty and registration fees formed 2.6%, and land revenues accounted for 3.2%.   \n20  For example, the recovery rate in health is 2.4% as against 4% at the national level. Cost recovery for higher education \nand technical education is negligible at 0.3%. \n21  From FY1988 to FY2003, outstanding state debt increased 4.8 times. ", "4  \nalso led to higher interest payments,22 exacerbated by recourse to increased borrowing from \nhigh cost sources such as small savings and provident funds, and poor cash management.23 \nThus, the average rate of interest on the state\u2019s borrowing increased from 7% in the early 1990s \nto around 10.5% in FY2002. Since the interest rate is higher than the rate of growth of the state \neconomy (approximately 7\u20138%), the debt position of the state is becoming unsustainable.  \n \n11.  Fiscal Governance Constraints. The fiscal constraints on the amount of resources due \nto rising revenue expenditures, choking capital expenditures, limits to revenue enhancement, \nand increased reliance on borrowing, has been compounded in Assam by fiscal governance \nconstraints that result in ineffective use of existing resources. At first sight, the state would seem \nto have little leeway in this regard since central transfers constitute over 62% of total revenues. \nHowever, the significance of current fiscal governance weaknesses in financial management \nand state budgeting on prioritization of expenditures in Assam can be illustrated through the \nunderutilization  of  centrally  sponsored  schemes.  ASG\u2019s  inability  to  allocate  the  necessary \ncounterpart funds required under centrally sponsored schemes has prevented the utilization of \ngrants allocated to it. In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General Report for FY1996\u20132001 \npointed to a lack of submission of utilization certificates and diversion of funds for education, \nirrigation, health and family welfare, public health engineering, and municipal administration.24  \n \n12.  Core Governance Constraints. Core governance constraints comprise overarching, \ncross-sector governance constraints that adversely affect the rationalization and quality of public \nexpenditure for the delivery of public goods and services. Poor public administration can act as \nsuch a core governance constraint. Various sociopolitical reasons during the last 2 decades \nhave given rise to an inordinate number of ASG employees. This is distorting the local labor \nmarket.25  Notwithstanding  efforts  by  ASG  to  make  government  more  responsive  and \naccountable, there are concerns about the limited capacity of ASG to effectively undertake its \ncore functions as a result of inadequately aligned organizational structures, skills and incentives, \nhuman resources management, and performance and accountability rules. Such organizational \nstructures are evident in overlapping assignment of functions and responsibilities, the skewed \nassignment of employees, and the high \u201ctail to teeth\u201d ratio of ASG employees where the tail is \nrepresented by grade III and IV and the teeth are represented by grades I and II, i.e., an \noverwhelming  predominance  of  grade  III  and  IV  employees.26  The  qualitative  performance \nindicators  in  the  sectors  suggest  that  this  kind  of  government  bureaucracy  has  not  been \neffective in delivering public goods and services.27\n                                                 \n22  Interest payments grew by 13.6% per annum from FY1988 to FY2003. \n23  During FY2002, the state incurred interest expenditure of Rs1.39 billion on ways and means advances and \noverdrafts. In FY2003, the state was in overdraft for 287 days, and for 154 working days payments were \nsuspended. The central Government and Reserve Bank of India provide ways and means advances to help the \nstate overcome temporary liquidity shortfalls. Overdrafts are amounts drawn by a state in excess of ways and \nmeans advances. \n24  For example, for the Nonformal Education Scheme, ASG did not utilize 45% of the central Government funds; for \nthe National Blindness Control Program Rs0.0157 billion out of Rs0.0159 billion remained unutilized; and for the \nIntegrated Irrigation Scheme on Kollong River and the Accelerated Urban Water Supply Program committed \ncentral assistance was never released. \n25  Three thousand teachers were recruited without sanctioned positions according to the 2003 Medium-Term Fiscal \nReform Program Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the central Government and ASG. Taking an \naverage family size of five, 1 of every 10 households in Assam is deriving income from government employment. \nGovernment employment pays approximately 250% of the local unskilled market rate in Assam. \n26 Based on 1998 estimates the total number of ASG employees was 443,934, the largest number were in the grade \nIII category, namely 333,085 representing 76.48% of total employees. Grades I and II represent the higher \ncategories of ASG employees. \n27  The census figures for Assam show that while Assam is in the mid-range of national literacy at 64.28% in 2001, in \nparticular districts like Dhubri, more than half the population aged seven and above is illiterate. In terms of infant ", "  5\n \n13.  The  poor  performance  of  Assam\u2019s  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs)  has  adversely \naffected the rationalization and quality of public expenditure for services by requiring subsidies \nand  causing  the  buildup  of  contingent  liabilities;  some  of  these  services  could  instead  be \nprovided by the private sector. ASG owns 47 PSEs, excluding the Assam State Electricity Board \n(ASEB).28 The performance of the PSEs has been poor: only 629 are profitable and of these, \nonly 2 (Assam Gas Co. Ltd. and Assam Petrochemicals Ltd.) are able to provide dividends. As \nPSEs underperformed, their ability to borrow from the market on the strength of their balance \nsheets declined. Consequently, they increasingly turned to ASG guarantees to access debt. \nASG guarantees, related largely to PSE borrowings, have grown approximately 1.8 times from \nFY1992 to FY2002. In addition, certain PSEs continue to act as a drain on the state budget by \nobtaining subsidies to cover their operations losses.30 A sector analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \n14.  Government  Reform  Commitment.  ASG  has  responded  to  these  challenges  by \nsignaling its clear intent to bring public finances back on a sustainable path and improve \ngovernance to enable income poverty reduction and employment generation through enhanced \ngrowth.  Sustained  high  growth  in  turn  depends  crucially  on  creating  fiscal  resources  for \nadditional public investment. Consequently, the state signed the Medium-Term Fiscal Reform \nProgram  (MTFRP)  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  in  March  2003  with  the  central \nGovernment, indicating its commitment to a medium-term strategy for fiscal consolidation. The \nMOU was signed under the aegis of the central Government\u2019s Fiscal Reforms Facility, which \nlinks  a  portion  of  untied  central  grants  to  the  fiscal  performance  correction  of  states  and \nprovides states with incentives to take up MTFRPs. In 2003, the state conducted debt swaps for \nhigh interest debt and undertook efforts to enact a value-added tax (VAT) law.31 ASG initiated a \nprogram to computerize its treasuries. By the end of 2003, ASG had adopted the Assam Power \nSector Development Program  with support from the  Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \nprogram initiated restructuring of ASEB and the transparent reflection of power sector liabilities \nin the state budget. ASG also implemented a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for the Assam \nState  Transport  Corporation.  Between  1999  and  2003,  it  reduced  regular  government \nemployees from 459,701 to 435,534\u2015an average reduction of about 6,042 a year.32 Finally, in \n2004, ASG ceased to pay approximately 3,000 unsanctioned teachers identified in the 2003 \nMTFRP MOU. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n15.  To build on this determination to solve fiscal and governance problems, the intent of the \nMTFRP MOU must be translated, through institutional strengthening and capacity building, into \na medium-term program framework of realistic fiscal and governance performance targets. A \nprogram that addresses the opportunities offered by specific fiscal, fiscal governance, and core \ngovernance issues can provide a fiscal stabilization solution suitable for Assam. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nmortality rates, the divergence between Assam (76 per 1,000 births) and India (70 per 1,000 births) was increasing \nby the end of the 1990s.  \n28 ASEB\u2019s performance is illustrated in Assam Power Sector Development Program. Asian Development Bank. 2003. \nReport and Recommendation of the President on Assam Power Sector Development Program. 10 Dec 2003. \nManila. \n29  The six PSEs are ARTFED; Assam Cooperative Jute Mills; Assam Electronics Development Corporation; Assam \nGas Company; Assam Petrochemicals; and Assam State Textbook Production and Publication Corporation.  \n30  For example, Assam State Transport Corporation is still obtaining state budget support. \n31  ASG\u2019s attempt to enact VAT legislation in 2003 did not go forward in the absence of a national consensus on VAT.  \n32  This represents a cumulative reduction in government employee strength by 6.54%. ", "6  \n1.  Fiscal \n16.  Medium-Term Fiscal Plan and Fiscal Responsibility. If the impetus to medium-term \nfiscal planning is to effectively contain Assam\u2019s revenue and fiscal deficits along a sequenced, \nbalanced, and time-bound path, legislation is needed to embed transparent and accountable \nfiscal discipline based on medium-term fiscal reform scenario targets supported by institutional \nmonitoring mechanisms. This would align Assam with the central Government, which adopted \nthe Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act in 2003.33  \n \n17.  Narrow Tax Base and Discretionary and Inefficient Tax Collection. The sales and \nexcise taxes in Assam offer a particular opportunity for addressing the narrow tax base and \ninefficient tax collection, and consequent enhancement of revenues. In terms of tax policy, a \nmajor shortcoming of the sales tax system is the narrow base due to the predominance of the \nlevy at the first point of sale. A part of the tax base is eroded because of fiscal incentives, \nthough their efficacy in promoting industrialization in the state is doubtful. Equally important is \nthe  low  sales  tax  administrative  capacity  and  poor  management  information  system  (MIS) \nleading to large-scale evasion and avoidance of tax, especially given the fact that neighboring \nstates, where sales tax is in its infancy, act as tax havens. Some problems relate to ineffective \nenforcement  and  inefficient  utilization  of  staff  on  functional  lines,  such  as  internal  audit, \ncompliance, enforcement, and recovery. Assessment of sales tax on an all-returns basis has \nbeen a continuing problem that needs immediate attention. As of 31 March 2003, as many as \n30,635 cases were pending assessment. Excise duty in Assam is currently constrained by a \nvariety of factors, including (i) inadequacies of border controls; (ii) system of specific levies, with \nexcise  duties  varying  by  type  of  brand  and  percentage  of  alcohol;  and  (iii)  system  of \ndepartmental controls on number of outlets under a fixed vendor fee and license fee system.  \n \n18.  The key question on stamp duty and registration fees is why they do not appear to be \nincreasing commensurate with the growth in land values in Assam, especially in urban areas. \nThe revenue from stamps and registration fees depends heavily on the valuation of properties \ntransacted. Because Assam has inadequately implemented the law to fix property value, the \nsystem and associated high rates of duty result in heavy undervaluation of property and loss of \nrevenue for ASG. \n \n19.  The question arises as to how the motor vehicles tax can be improved commensurate \nwith the increase in transport traffic given its buoyancy. Tax administration measures proposed \naim to expand the tax base and curb evasion, especially at the interstate border.  \n \n20.  Agricultural income tax generated revenues of Rs1.03 billion in FY1992, but declined to \nRs0.02 billion in FY2003 given the fluctuating fortunes of the tea industry. A key issue is the lack \nof harmonization of the peak rate of agricultural income tax with business income, leading to \nunderstatement  of  composite  income  and  transfers  of  proceeds  from  agriculture  to  pure \nbusiness income.  \n \n21.  Nontax Revenue Enhancement. Tapping the potential of nontax sources for enhancing \nrevenue would require raising fees, rent, and inflation-indexed user charges. Linking such hikes \nwith improvement in quality and delivery of service with targeted protection for the poor is a key \nissue. Such linkage and local administration of such nontax revenues provides opportunities that \n                                                 \n33  The Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act requires the central Government to eliminate the \nrevenue deficit by FY2008 (shifted to FY2009 through an amendment under the Finance Bill of July 2004). Various \nstates such as Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh have enacted fiscal responsibility \nlegislation at the state level. ", "  7\nhave not been sufficiently exploited. This lack of participatory management of maintenance \nreinforces reliance on costly departmental staffing and attendant revenue expenditures.  \n \n22.  Restructure State Debt. Key  issues  that  present  significant  potential  for  containing \nASG\u2019s  debt  stock  and  interest  payments  are  (i)  redressing  reliance  on  ways  and  means \nadvances  and  overdrafts,  (ii)  using  available  debt  swapping  and  settlement  to  relieve \nprepayable  past  high  interest  debt,  and  (iii)  addressing  debt  policy  inadequacies  and \nadministrative constraints on effective cash and debt management of ASG. ASG has been \nundertaking Rs8.35 billion of debt swapping of high interest debt, drawing on National Small \nSavings Fund proceeds (and matching market borrowings) in FY2003. It has contained the level \nof reliance on ways and means advances and overdrafts from the peak of FY2001 and FY2002. \nHowever, more opportunities exist combined with better institutional mechanisms and systems \nfor cash and debt management to increase data on loans and reduce reliance on the Reserve \nBank of India and Comptroller and Auditor General for loan information requirements. \n \n23.  Containment  of  State  Pensions.  Three  key  issues,  if  addressed,  can  potentially \ncontribute to containing burgeoning retirement benefits in Assam. First, in terms of the structure \nof retirement benefits: (i) benefits are coupled with rising wages and salaries; (ii) dearness relief \noutstrips  inflation;  and  (iii)  significant  up-front  commutation  payments  are  available.  The \nincrease in the number of employees retiring, compounded by particularly significant spurts in \nemployment growth in the 1970s and 1980s, means that in the longer term, the state may face a \nliquidity issue as it seeks to meet retirement benefit dues.  \n \n24.  Second, given the substantial liability represented by the retirement benefits dues the \nstate is obligated to pay current employees when they retire, the state budget will be faced with \nunmanageable and unfunded pension liabilities if no systemic change is made to the defined \nretirement benefit costs for new ASG employees. This will undermine the sustainability of state \nfinances in the medium term.34  \n \n25.  Finally,  in  terms  of  administrative  processing  capacity  and  management,  the  rising \npension expenditures will require more efficient processing capacity than the state currently \npossesses. Failure to address this key institutional constraint over the medium term will result in \nabuse  of  pension  entitlements,  pension  arrears  for  ASG  employees,  and  forecasting \nweaknesses that the state cannot afford given the trend of pension liabilities.  \n \n2.  Fiscal Governance \n26.  State Budgeting and Financial Management. In Assam, state budgets are prepared \non an annual basis without medium-term planning. Medium-term planning over a 3- to 5-year \ntime horizon provides an opportunity for state budget planning, preparation, and presentation to \nfoster revenue forecasting that is not overly optimistic. It would strengthen budget expenditure \ninformation for state policy on medium-term fiscal plan (MTFP) targets and rigorous capital \nexpenditure priorities over the medium-term, as well as enhance the scrutiny of expenditures \nconsistent with the resource available. There is a corresponding need for transparent fiscal \nreporting on critical fiscal data that are not distorted in terms of off-budget borrowings (such as \nby public sector enterprises) and arrears on bills and dues that defer deficits. This requires an \nintegrated public financial MIS that ultimately links reliable and comprehensive employee and \npension databases to a treasury and payments information technology system and state-wide \nuniform procurement standards. These are yet to be established in the state. The integrity of \n                                                 \n34 According to current actuarial estimates this liability for ASG could amount to a present value of as much as three \ntimes its FY2003 GSDP. ", "8  \nany future medium-term fiscal planning and legislatively mandated fiscal responsibility for the \nstate will be dependent on such fiscal governance issues being addressed. \n \n3.  Core Governance \n27.  Public Administration. Several key issues need to be addressed to rationalize the high \ncomponent of salaries and wages of ASG employees in revenue expenditures, and assess the \nquality of expenditure on such employees.  \n \n28.  First, the level of replacement of retiring government employees needs to be addressed. \nGiven the high public administration cost as a percentage of GSDP,35 containment of the \nreplacement to attrition ratio is of critical importance for creating sustainable fiscal resources.36 \nAgainst the background of government employment in a high unemployment state, this will need \nto be accompanied by support for developing businesses and vocational training.  \n \n29.  Second,  assessment  of  public  administration  performance,  in  terms  of  leakage, \ncorruption, and appropriate functional efficiency is important for effective rationalization. \n \n30.  Finally,  the  absence  of  a  full  employee  database  constrains  the  ability  of  ASG  to \nresponsibly and efficiently restructure the size of its government employment and the collateral \neffects that reducing government employment would have on retirement benefits. The database \nwould address the weak administrative capacity of ASG with regard to government employment, \nevidenced by ASG\u2019s inability to identify all nonessential posts since 1999. \n \n31.  Public  Sector  Enterprises.  Five  key  issues  need  to  be  addressed  to  contain  the \ninvestment and operating losses and guaranteed loan overdues of PSEs in Assam. First, the \nfiscal effect of the noncommercial orientation of PSEs must be limited by enhancing corporate \ngovernance requirements for PSEs. The noncommercial character of a substantial number of \nPSEs  has  resulted  in  large-scale,  commercially  unjustified  employment  creation,37  and \nappointments to senior management positions and the board that are not based on professional \nexpertise or the best commercial talent, but are subject to political/bureaucratic influences.  \n \n32.  Second strengthened financial governance is needed to contain loss making by PSEs. \nFor example, for the 47 PSEs, on average, the most current financial statements are 8 years \nold.  Some  PSEs  have  not  prepared  financial  statements  for  up  to  20  years.38  Financial \ngovernance would also require ASG to explicitly acknowledge unfunded liabilities of PSEs, like \nASEB, and reflect these in the state budget. Improved financial governance would enable ASG \nto better manage its PSE exposure.  \n \n33.  Third,  the  excessive  debt  burden  for  some  loss-making  PSEs  raises  the  issue  of \nimpediments to their closure. Cumulative losses and lack of funding combined with lack of hard \nbudget constraints applied by ASG to PSEs, enabled PSEs to increasingly borrow\u2014through \nASG\u2014guaranteed loans from financial institutions and unguaranteed loans, and incur overdues \nwith financial institutions. This means that PSEs have ended up carrying an unfavorable debt-\n                                                 \n35 Assam\u2019s public administration outlay was 7.76% of GSDP in FY2001; this was higher than Andhra Pradesh \n(5.25%), Karnataka (4.99%), and West Bengal (6.10%). \n36 The price effects on the average salary of ASG employees are also important. These include the potential merger \nof 50% of dearness allowance with basic pay initiated by the central Government. \n37 Assam currently has approximately 32,000 PSE employees. \n38 Examples of long-dated arrears, include Assam Government Marketing Corporation (20 years arrears) and Assam \nLivestock and Poultry Development Corporation (17 years arrears). The availability of up-to-date audited accounts \nis critical for a PSE closure and restructuring program. ", "  9\nequity ratio with an unsustainable debt burden.39 The shifting of PSE funding gaps to PSE \nemployees prevents legal closure and results in further debts for state finances.40  \n \n34.  Fourth, the needs of employees to be separated from PSEs to be closed must be \naddressed through an appropriate VRS and social safety net (SSN). \n \n35.  Finally, the fragmented and inadequate oversight of ASG needs to be addressed. ASG \nhas no comprehensive PSE policy and no coordinating senior decision-making body that is able \nto  effectively  champion  and  guide  PSE  reforms.  No  effective  implementing  agencies  are \navailable for such reforms. Instead, the responsibility to manage ASG interest in the 47 PSEs is \nspread over 21 government departments.  \n \n36.  Lessons Learned. These issues underlying weak sector performance confirm lessons \ndrawn  from  previous  experience  in  policy-based  adjustment  lending  in  India.41  Careful \nconsideration should be given to (i) the need for extensive time in consensus building dialogue \nand ownership of the policy-based program lending, not only from the executing agency, but \nalso across different line departments and levels of government and government officials; (ii) the \nneed for a reform program that carefully integrates governance and public finance reforms and \ndoes so in a manner of a program of manageable proportions focused on end results; (iii) the \ncrucial linkage between power sector reforms and public resource management reforms in \nterms of fiscal impact; (iv) the need to ensure transparent flexibility in numerical targets for \nrevenue and fiscal deficit, given the sensitivity to changes in the external environment including \nchanges in central Government policies and natural calamities; (v) the need to emphasize not \nmerely policy reforms but also institutional capacity building through a project loan under a \nsector  development  program  modality  that  modernizes  public  finance  and  management \nsystems, and provides training, consulting services, and information technology systems that \nhelp state governments ensure assessment, identification, and timely achievement of desired \npolicy reforms; (vi) the need for a public awareness program that explains the rationale of the \nreforms and its benefits to all stakeholders, including the general public, government officials, \nand  taxpayers  and  user  charge  payers;  and  (vii)  the  need  to  incorporate  institutional \nmechanisms and capacity building of government officials for intensive and rigorous monitoring.  \n \n37.  Rationale. Since the mid-1990s, ADB\u2019s strategy has been, at the request of the central \nGovernment, to focus on state policy and institutional reform operations successively in Gujarat, \nMadhya  Pradesh,  Kerala,  and  now  Assam.  Sustainable  state  reform  efforts  on  fiscal  and \ngovernance issues is key to central Government efforts to inject effective fiscal management, \neliminate the revenue deficit, gradually reduce the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP to \nachieve the development goals of the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007), and attain a well-\ndistributed growth of income in line with the Millenium Development Goals in the country as a \nwhole. Such a state-level reform effort is particularly critical in Assam as the gateway to the \nnortheast if the threat of a widening development gap between different parts of India is to be \naverted. However, this will only be possible if India\u2019s development partners support Assam\u2019s \nefforts, anchored on the 2003 MTFRP MOU by financing the cost of adjustment of reforms by \nway of state programs that have (i) broad-based stakeholder support for implementation of a \ncarefully  sequenced  fiscal  and  governance  reform  agenda;  (ii)  sustained  monitoring  of \nrealistically set fiscal and governance targets founded on careful diagnostic analysis; and (iii) \n                                                 \n39  Some  PSE  debt-equity  ratio  examples  are  Fertichem  7.9:1,  and  Assam  Financial  Corporation  5.3:1;  the \nsustainable norm of a debt-equity ratio is 2:1. \n40 In the case of Fertichem (one of the 47 PSEs in Assam), a court decision held that the PSE was liable for any labor \ncost obligations between the closure of operations and the issuance of notice to employees for closure. \n41 A more general description of lessons by ADB is in ADB.1999. Review of ADB\u2019s Program Lending Policies. Manila. ", "10  \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building to ensure effective implementation of reforms, \nespecially in a state with weak institutional capacity. The proposed Program would deepen \npower sector reform efforts of the Assam Power Sector Development Program (footnote 28) and \ncomplement the efforts of other development agencies that are increasingly focusing on a \nvariety of sectors in Assam. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \nIV.   THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n38.  Objectives. The Program seeks to further ASG\u2019s goal of sequenced stabilization and \nconsolidation of state finances to enhance growth and reduce poverty in Assam initiated by its \n2003  MTFRP  MOU  with  the  central  Government.  The  Program  does  so  by  supporting  a \nprogram of sustainable reduction of fiscal and revenue deficits through policy, legal, regulatory, \nand  institutional  reforms  for  (i)  creating  fiscal  resources;  (ii)  improving  utilization  and \nprioritization  of  existing  fiscal  resources;  and  (iii)  stemming  unproductive  expenditure  and \nfostering the quality of public expenditure, as well as facilitating alternative opportunities for \nprivate-sector-driven growth and employment. \n \n39.  Scope. To achieve this objective, the Program will comprise both a policy loan (program \nloan) as part of a program cluster (the Program) and a project loan. Given the balanced nature \nof the reforms needed to address fiscal and governance constraints and the medium-term \nnature of the reform process required in institutionally more challenged states like Assam, the \nprogram  loan  supports  the  first  of  two  sequential  subprograms  under  a  program  cluster \nmodality. This allows for the realistic delivery of commitments and a measured building up of \nmomentum  for  reform.  Subprogram  1  will  develop  a  fiscal  stabilization  and  governance \nframework through (i) a coherent fiscal responsibility regime and performance targets, and \nestablishment  of  cash  management  discipline;  (ii)  key  policy  reforms  on  revenues,  nontax \nrevenues,  pension  liability  containment,  expenditure  prioritization,  PSEs,  and  public \nadministration rationalization; (iii) key assessment of private sector development and public \nadministration quality; (iv) key operationalization of debt restructuring and settlement, PSE \nclosure, SSN, and acknowledgment and budget provision for ASEB terminal benefit liabilities; \nand (v) institutional development targets for fiscal, revenue, tax, debt, pension, and employee \nadministration;  and  key  elements  of  an  ultimate  integrated  public  financial  management \ninformation system. This will establish the foundation for subprogram 2, which will seek to \ndevelop deeper fiscal consolidation and governance reforms for reorienting the role of the state \nthrough (i) revenue administration integration synergies and continued updating of the MTFP; \n(ii) implementation of user fee policy reforms, and private sector participation outsourcing and \nparticipation founded on user fee reforms; (iii) debt restructuring based on enhanced public debt \nmanagement; (iv) parametric reforms regarding state pension liabilities and automation of all \npension settlement and payment processes; (v) departmental budget performance orientation; \n(vi) performance accountability and reporting for sector departments and implementation of an \nintegrated public financial MIS; (vii) PSE closures and restructuring based on implementation of \nsubprogram 1 PSE closures and acknowledgement of ASEB terminal benefit liabilities; (viii) \ndevelopment of a private sector facilitation policy and action plan for implementation; and (ix) \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  a  public  administration  restructuring  action  plan,  and \ncomputerization of salaries and wages settlement and payment processes. The maturing of \ninstitutional developments needed to underpin key fiscal reforms will be sequenced over two \nappropriate  subprogram  implementation  periods.  The  project  loan  is  designed  to  address \ncapacity  building,  institutional  and  systems  constraints  through  consulting  services  and ", "  11\nprocurement to enable accomplishment of fiscal and governance reforms under the program \nloan, and support the deeper fiscal and governance reforms of subprogram 2.  \n \nB.  Important Features \n40.  An important feature of the Program is the application of the program cluster within a \nsector  development  program  modality  for  reform  of  public  finances,  tailored  to  the \ncircumstances in Assam. This will allow a holistic approach to reform over the medium term. \nFlexibility  is  built  in  for  accelerating  performance-based  adjustment  through  an  incentive \ntranche. In addition to enabling a medium-term reform process with suitable acceleration, the \nProgram  also  carefully  addresses  the  institutional  challenges  in  Assam  by  sequencing \ninstitutional  development  prior  to  introducing  legislation,  such  as  on  fiscal  responsibility. \nParticular attention is given to institutional and capacity weaknesses in Assam through the \nprovision of the project loan, which will support institutional strengthening and capacity building. \nA chronology of program processing is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nC.  The Program Loan \n1.  Objectives  \n41.   Subprogram 1 of the program cluster aims to enhance growth and ultimately reduce \npoverty by reducing Assam\u2019s fiscal and revenue deficits on a sustainable basis through fiscal \nand governance reforms that (i) stabilize state finances; and (ii) establish the foundation for \neffective utilization, prioritization, and reorientation of public expenditures. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n42.  Subprogram 1. The three main components of fiscal and governance reforms under \nsubprogram 1 are (i) reform of state finances to create fiscal resources; (ii) reform of fiscal \ngovernance to improve budget and expenditure management processes for better utilization \nand prioritization of existing fiscal resources; and (iii) reorientation of the role of the state to stem \nunproductive government and public sector enterprise expenditure, improve the quality of public \nexpenditure,  and  facilitate  alternative  opportunities  for  private-sector-driven  growth  and \nemployment. \n \n43.  Three component goals underpin the overall objective; each is met by attaining certain \noutcomes.  To  attain  the  outcomes  in  a  phased  manner,  broad  achievement  targets  are \nformulated for each of the subprograms and for each of the tranches in the subprogram. To \nmeet  the  achievement  targets,  which  will  trigger  a  release  of  the  particular  tranche  of \nsubprogram 1, specific policy actions underpinning the achievement need to be implemented. \nThe Government\u2019s development policy letter and detailed policy matrix (Appendix 3) provide \nachievements and policy actions across the tranches of both subprograms of the Program. The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 4. A summary table of commitments by components and \noutcomes is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n44.  The three component goals and their related outcomes are \n \n(i)  Component 1: goal: reform of state finances; outcomes are \n(a)  enhance fiscal responsibility, \n(b)  broaden the tax base and enhance tax collection, \n(c)  enhance nontax revenues, \n(d)  restructure state debt, and ", "12  \n(e)  contain state pension liabilities; \n \n(ii)  Component 2: goal: fiscal governance reforms; outcomes are \n(a)  improve state budgeting, and \n(b)  enhance poverty-focused and growth-oriented expenditure; \n \n(iii)  Component 3: goal: reorienting the role of the state; outcomes are \n(a)  public sector enterprises reform, \n(b)  strengthen public-private partnerships, and \n(c)  public administration review. \n  \na.  Component 1: Reform of State Finances \n \ni.  Enhance Fiscal Responsibility \n45.  Medium-Term Fiscal Plan. Addressing ASG\u2019s fiscal constraints requires the Program to \nset the foundation stones for a fiscal responsibility regime that introduces key fiscal prudence \nchecks and balances. A critical element is the formulation, adoption, and implementation of an \nMTFP.  An  MTFP  would  link  integrated  fiscal  and  governance  reform  measures  to  the \nachievement of fiscal projection target outcomes to create sustainable fiscal resources over a \nmedium-term time frame.  \n \n46.  The MTFP fiscal projection targets for creating sustainable fiscal resources under the \nProgram are designed to achieve (i) at least two percentage points reduction in revenue deficit \nto revenue receipts ratio on average per annum from FY2005 to FY2009; (ii) a gradual increase \nin the capital outlay to GSDP ratio from 1.5% to 2.5%, subject to absorptive capacity; (iii) a \nsustainable revenue surplus by FY2008; and (iv) a significant reduction in the debt to GSDP \nratio  from  40%  to  37%  by  FY2009.  The  MTFP  will  measure  projections  through  a  single \nindicator (revenue deficit to revenue receipts ratio). This indicator is proposed under the central \nGovernment\u2019s Fiscal Reform Facility to monitor and evaluate overall reduction of fiscal stress by \ncapturing key off-budget impacts. However, since Assam is a Special Category State with \nsignificant dependence on the central Government for its resources, the MTFP should also \nfocus  on  multidimensional  fiscal  performance  indicators,  including  revenue  deficit  to  own \nrevenue, for monitoring and evaluation purposes. These reform scenario projection targets, \nprepared in consultation with ASG and the central Government, will form inputs into ASG\u2019s \nFY2007 and FY2008 budgets in the context of a medium-term fiscal consolidation framework \nthrough FY2009. The MTFP is in Appendix 5, and the key assumptions underpinning the MTFP \nare in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n47.  Fiscal  Responsibility  Legislation.  Given  the  pressures  on  state  finances,  the \nestablishment of a fiscal-enabling framework introducing transparent and accountable fiscal \ndiscipline will need to be legislatively embedded after careful calibration of targets predicated on \nserious multiyear plans that translate targets into realistic strategies. The Program will support \nintroduction of a fiscal responsibility bill after due examination of fiscal targets under the MTFP. \nThe up-front adoption of MTFP fiscal projection targets under subprogram 1, which will be \nreviewed on a regular basis, will enable updating of the targets based on new information. Thus \nin due course the awards of the 12th Finance Commission will be incorporated into subsequent \nMTFP updates. Eventually, having tested the MTFP over the course of a state budget cycle, \nASG will introduce a fiscal responsibility bill by the incentive tranche of subprogram 1 and take \nall steps for its adoption. This legislation will establish a fiscal constitution for the state, including ", "  13\nquantitative and time-bound targets for fiscal and revenue deficits,42 multiyear budget forecasts \nin line with these targets, regular reporting requirements of performance against these targets, \nand requirements on off-budget liabilities and guarantees.  \n \n48.  Fiscal Management Unit. For a fiscal responsibility regime to be effective, regular and \ndetailed monitoring of fiscal targets is essential. Under the Program, ASG will establish a fiscal \nmanagement unit (FMU) in the ASG Finance Department to act as the secretariat for a program \nsteering committee. The FMU will provide institutional support for managing fiscal responsibility \nwith regular monitoring, evaluation, follow-up, and remedial action, and reporting of MTFP fiscal \nprojection targets. Buttressed by skills and systems development, the role of the FMU\u2019s five \nreform cells\u2014revenue reform, expenditure reform, budget reform, pension reform, and debt \nmanagement\u2014will enable the FMU to act as a key driver of institutional reforms such as (i) debt \nmanagement  with  the  sourcing  of  loan  data  information;  and  (ii)  management  of  central \ntransfers, including recording, monitoring, and evaluating the utilization of central transfers. This, \nin turn, will strengthen the basis for the FMU to undertake quarterly MTFP review and remedial \naction reports for monitoring, evaluating, and follow-up of MTFP performance indicators on \nrevenues, expenditure, debt, central transfers, subsidies, and cost recovery. The successful \nestablishment and operationalization of the FMU under subprogram 1 will form the basis of \neffective  monitoring  and  compliance  with  fiscal  responsibility  legislation  provisions  in \nsubprogram 2.  \n \n49.  Cash  Management  Reform.  To  instill  fiscal  prudence  and  responsibility  in  cash \nmanagement as part of the Program\u2019s overall fiscal responsibility against the backdrop of state \nrecourse to expensive ways and means advances and overdrafts, ASG will commit to adopting \na policy of not resorting to overdrafts with the Reserve Bank of India so as to ensure that there \nare  no  year-end  negative  cash  balances.  Subprogram  1  will  support  this  commitment  by \nproviding  one-time  adjustment  cost  support  for  ASG\u2019s  existing  negative  cash  balance  for \nFY2006, and introducing key elements of a public financial MIS as part of fiscal governance \nreforms. \n \nii.  Broaden the Tax Base and Enhance Tax Collection \n50.  Tax Policy Reforms. Given the current constraints on revenue enhancement, ASG will \nneed to adopt certain revenue measures under subprogram 1, as part of a package of fiscal \nmeasures designed to achieve the MTFP fiscal projection targets. These revenue measures will \nneed to focus on (i) widening the tax base rather than increasing tax rates, to bring economic \nactivities that are currently exempted within the scope of the tax system; (ii) increasing tax \nbuoyancy  linked  to  higher  GSDP;  and  (iii)  reducing  incentives  for  tax  evasion  rather  than \nthrough imposing taxes ad hoc, which may adversely affect the growth of GSDP. Consequently, \nthe Program will entail tax policy reforms for major taxes, such as, sales tax, excise, stamp, and \nagricultural taxes in accordance with such policy parameters. Tax policy measures will be \ndeveloped under the aegis of the FMU\u2019s revenue reform cell, which will be mandated to prepare \nand monitor the development of tax policy measures agreed under the policy matrix. \n \n51.  Sales Tax. Against the backdrop of a marginal rise in recent growth and a narrow tax \nbase for sales tax, critical policy actions under subprogram 1 will entail (i) up-front commitment \nto overall policy direction to a VAT or stand-alone VAT equivalent system by the first tranche; \nand (ii) introduction of a VAT or stand-alone VAT equivalent law by the incentive tranche. In so \ndoing,  subprogram  1  will  build  on  ASG  commitment  to  move  toward  introducing  a  VAT \namendment law in line with a national consensus on rate harmonization, or if the national \n                                                 \n42 These targets will be subject to exceptions for exogenous circumstances outside ASG control. ", "14  \nconsensus fails to emerge, introducing a VAT equivalent law on a stand-alone basis in advance \nof state elections due in 2006. This indicates the acceptance of the compelling logic of VAT by \nthe state irrespective of rate harmonization in terms of ensuring a broadening of the tax base by \nmoving beyond a first point of sale tax system, and establishing a destination-based tax that \neliminates  the  cascading  effect  of  sales  tax  linked  to  different  stages  of  production  and \ndistribution. \n \n52.  Excise. Promoting best practices in the levy of excise will help capture price rises as a \nresult of inflation. The introduction of competitiveness in the collection of excise will enhance \nrevenues  and  improve  the  long-term  buoyancy  of  excise  duties.  Consequently,  under \nsubprogram 1, critical policy actions on excise enhancement will entail (i) commitment to overall \npolicy direction to a less discretionary and more competitive excise system by the first tranche; \nand (ii) introduction of amendments to the Excise Act for ad valorem excise duty on Indian-\nmade foreign liquor by the incentive tranche, and an alternative competitive method of collection \nof excise for country spirits by the second tranche. \n \n53.  Stamp  Duties  and  Registration  Fees.  Given  concerns  for  underlying  property \nundervaluation for stamps and registration fees under subprogram 1, commitment to overall \npolicy direction for an objective method of underlying property valuation in the first tranche will \nbe followed by adoption and operationalization of an objective valuation method by the second \ntranche. This will improve fairness and transparency, while reducing vulnerability to corruption. \n \n54.  Agricultural Income Tax. Policy actions under subprogram 1 seek to counteract the \ndecline in buoyancy and total tax collection of the potentially important agricultural income tax \nrelated to the local tea industry by stipulating a reduction in the peak rate consistent with \nbusiness income. This is designed to counter the incentive to understate the composite income \nand transfer part of the proceeds from agriculture to pure business income.  \n \n55.  Tax  and  Revenue  Administration.  To  address  fiscal  constraints  on  tax  collection \ninefficiencies that can undermine sustainable revenue increases, substantial tax and revenue \nadministration actions will be required. The introduction of tax policy reform measures under \nsubprogram  1,  such  as  a  VAT  equivalent  system,  ad  valorem  excise  duty,  and  objective \nproperty valuation for stamps and registration fees, will need to be accompanied by tax and \nrevenue administration measures under subprogram 1 if the tax policy reform measure gains \nare to be achieved. In sequencing terms, subprogram 1 acknowledges ASG\u2019s capacity and \nsystems needs in designing a phased introduction of tax administration reforms for sales tax, \nexcise, motor vehicles, and stamps and registration fees commencing with commitment to \noverall policy direction in the first tranche. The specific tax administration measures, specific \nrevenue administration measures (composite check posts), and supportive tax administration \nmeasures  under  an  action  plan  for  development  of  validating  management  information  to \nsupport composite check posts will be spearheaded by the FMU\u2019s revenue reform cell under \nsubprogram  1.  This  is  designed  to  eventually  lead  to  a  unified  and  integrated  revenue \nadministration system under subprogram 2.  \n \n56.  Tax policy is only as good as its corollary tax administration. To maximize VAT tax policy \ngains, substantive sales tax administration measures under subprogram 1 will focus on four \nareas. First, sales tax will be functionally reorganized, moving away from the current geographic \norganization  to  increase  the  effectiveness  and  efficiencies  of  tax  compliance.  Sales  tax \nadministration will be aligned with the introduction of a VAT equivalent system. Information \ntechnology and modern process engineering will be introduced that is capable of providing \naccurate, timely, and sufficient tax information and clear tax assessment arrears. Second, sales ", "  15\ntax  administration  measures  will  focus  on  a  risk-based  assessment  role  that  will  balance \nconcerns  on  identification  and  penalization  of  tax  evaders  and  late  filers  with  a  voluntary \ncompliance  taxpayer-friendly  system.  Third,  performance  management  and  other  human \nresource management tools will be employed as incentives to improve performance of tax \nadministration staff. Fourth, an MIS for sales tax, including dealer registration, will be developed.  \n \n57.  To counter the vulnerability of excise duties to crossborder smuggling based on rate \ndifferentials and to ensure that the revenue gains of ad valorem levy are attained, subprogram 1 \nwill  target  functional  reorganization  of  excise  enforcement,  and  enhancement  of  excise \nenforcement and monitoring procedures and excise MIS. \n \n58.   Subprogram 1 will establish composite check posts linked to automated processing and \nsystems for various tax regimes. These composite check posts will be designed to provide a \ncommon tax administration facility to reduce corruption, effectively control border evasion of \ntaxes, track noncompliant taxpayers, and impose penalties. In addition, common taxpayer-\nfriendly information will be developed as part of revenue administration at such check posts, \nthereby  reducing  duplicative  citizen  compliance  costs.  This  will  form  the  foundation  for \ndevelopment of integrated systems and institutional structures for accountable, transparent, and \nperformance-based revenue administration under subprogram 2.  \n \n59.  Fiscal Empowerment of Local Governments Given the state of ASG finances, local \ngovernments in Assam cannot effectively discharge their responsibilities under constitutionally \nmandated  legislation,  notwithstanding  recent  panchayat  (local  body)  elections  in  Assam. \nBuilding on the thrust of Assam\u2019s Second State Finance Commission report, subprogram 1 \nfocuses on developing local fiscal empowerment, culminating with approval of unit area method-\nbased property tax to provide financing of local bodies by the second tranche.  \n \niii.  Enhance Nontax Revenues \n60.  User Charges. To address the poor performance of state-determined user charges in \nAssam, while taking account of potential opposition to the introduction of commercial discipline \nto nonpaying customers and improvement of cost recovery in the public sector, under the first \ntranche of subprogram 1, the affordability, service quality, and feasibility43 of increases in user \ncharges for a cross section of significant sectors such as health, transport, water supply, and \neducation will be reviewed. In this review, principles of cost recovery and commercial discipline \nwill be applied, balanced by requirements of improved service delivery and targeted protection \nfor the poor. By the second tranche of subprogram 1, ASG will approve certain measures to \ninitiate the enhancement of user charges as indicated in the policy matrix. These methods of \ncost recovery and institutional reforms to improve collection efficiency under subprogram 1 will \nbe  implemented  and  form  the  basis  for  enhanced  service  delivery  through  private  sector \nparticipation under subprogram 2. \n \niv.  Restructure State Debt \n61.  Debt Restructuring. To contain the substantial high interest debt burden on the state \nfor creating critical fiscal resources in accordance with the MTFP beyond the agreement in the \nMTFRP MOU, ASG must focus on substantial swapping and settlement of previous state debt. \nConsequently, under subprogram 1, ASG will undertake (i) a swap of high-cost, small savings \nloans availed of from the central Government with lower cost loans; and (ii) settlement of high \n                                                 \n43  Economics and Research Department, ADB. 2003. Setting User Charges for Public Services: Policies and Practice \nat ADB. Technical Note Series 9. Manila.  ", "16  \ninterest institutional loans.44 The debt swap will entail (i) small savings being collected in Assam; \n(ii) small savings being transferred to the National Small Savings Fund and being provided by \nthe central Government as National Small Savings Fund small savings loans to ASG; and (iii) a \npart of such small savings loans being retained by the central Government to provide a debt \nswap for the earlier high-cost small savings loans to ASG with interest in excess of 12%. The \nproportion of the small savings loans that can be used to prepay earlier costlier debt was 20% \nfor FY2003, 30% in FY2004, and will be 40% in FY2005. Depending on the quantum of small \nsavings loans that can be used to prepay the earlier higher cost debt, a matching amount for \nsuch debt swapping is also permitted by the central Government by way of market borrowings. \nBased on crystallized and documented negotiation with banks and financial institutions, ASG \nwill reduce identified high-interest debt by settling such institutional loans to PSEs and other \nentities. The Program provides earmarked adjustment cost support for such debt settlement. \n \n62.  Debt Management. To ensure the sustainability of fiscal resources created by debt \nrestructuring in Assam, such debt restructuring will need to be accompanied by institutional \nsupport and process performance benchmarks for public debt management. Consequently, in \nsubprogram 1, ASG will undertake several key measures through the FMU\u2019s debt management \ncell. Under the first and second tranches, the buildup and establishment of an automated \ncomprehensive  loan  database  of  government  and  government  guaranteed  borrowing  and \nonlending will be sequenced. This database, which will include an inventory of all terms of \nborrowing,  maturity,  loan  amount,  source,  debt-servicing  dates,  outstanding  balances,  and \nguarantees, will address the currently fragmented nature of debt data requiring ASG to rely on \ninformation provided by the Reserve Bank of India and Comptroller and Auditor General. Such a \nloan and guarantees database, linked to the Reserve Bank of India, will enable the FMU to \ngenerate periodic MIS reports for ASG related to the MTFP, including any compliance report of \nthe  MTFP  to  the  Cabinet  that  would  precede  enactment  of  a  fiscal  responsibility  act.  By \nrecording  and  reporting  guarantees  made  and  discharged,  the  database  will  also  enable \nsystematic risk analyses to be undertaken on ASG\u2019s contingent liabilities for evaluating and \nmonitoring the risk of these guarantees, and undertaking necessary follow-up action. In addition, \nsubprogram 1 will ensure that a loan procedures and systems manual is developed based on an \naudit of loan procedures, and administrative circulars and orders on public sector borrowing to \nembed process benchmarks. In subprogram 2, this debt-restructuring and management strategy \nwill continue targeted reduction of debt servicing in accordance with the MTFP.  \n \nv.  Contain State Pension Liabilities \n63.  Against the background of burgeoning unfunded state pension liabilities, no reliable \nestimation of pension liabilities is available, no pension policy framework is in use to contain \nfuture  liabilities,  and  no  pension  administration  is  in  place  to  ensure  pension  processing \ndiscipline and mitigate forecasting difficulties on future liability requirements. To assess the \nextent of vulnerability of the state\u2019s public finance system resulting from the current system of \npension payments, ASG will complete an actuarial estimation of total pension liabilities by the \nsecond tranche of subprogram 1, based on full employee and pension data, MTFP policy \nassumptions, and a 75-year estimation for projections given that pension reform will take at \nleast 50 years to yield desired results. Under subprogram 1, the completion of this actuarial \nestimation of Assam\u2019s pension liability will be accompanied by the introduction of pension policy \nreform. Pension liability estimation will be accomplished under a time-bound action plan of the \nFMU pension reform cell. Pension policy and administration reforms agreed under the policy \nmatrix will also be developed under the aegis of the FMU pension reform cell. \n                                                 \n44 Such high interest institutional loans to PSEs and other entities guaranteed by ASG do not include one-time \nsettlement of government guaranteed loans to PSEs identified for closure (para. 73). ", "  17\n \n64.  In  terms  of  pension  policy  reform,  ASG  will  address  the  issue  of  rising  pension \nexpenditure as part of revenue expenditures under subprogram 1. ASG will commit up front to \nan overall policy direction on (i) parametric reform options to contain the cost of the current pay-\nas-you-go system for the current stock of government employees;45 and (ii) commitment to \nsystemic reforms in terms of shifting to a pension scheme for new government employees \naligned to one announced by the central Government, which will be cheaper and less fiscally \nrisky than the current pension scheme for government employees. By the incentive tranche of \nsubprogram 1, ASG will approve systemic reform for new government employee pensions \nbased  on  employee  and  employer  contributions.  Under  subprogram  1,  initial  earmarked \nadjustment  cost  support  for  this  systemic  change  will  be  provided.  Further  earmarked \nadjustment cost support for such major systemic change and introduction of parametric reforms \nwill then be considered under subprogram 2.  \n \n65.  In terms of pension administration reform, under subprogram 1, ASG will mitigate the \npension data weaknesses in forecasting pension liability and the consequent gaps between \nactual expenditure and budgeted estimates and opportunity for abuse of the pensions system, \nby establishing a pension database by the second tranche.  \n \nb.  Component 2: Fiscal Governance Reforms \n \n66.  Improve State Budgeting. Currently, ASG operates a traditional state budget system, \nwhich is endemically overstretched in terms of a plethora of initiatives that are underfunded and \nsystemically overoptimistic in terms of budget revenue estimates as opposed to actuals. Under \nsubprogram 1, ASG will seek to realign state budgeting commensurate with the needs of \nenhanced fiscal responsibility. First, ASG will address transparency in state budget planning, \npreparation, and presentation to contain factors that may distort or limit state budget data and \nthereby affect the quality and comprehensiveness of fiscal data required for fiscal adjustments \nunder  the  MTFP  and  ultimately  the  state\u2019s  fiscal  responsibility  act.  Consequently,  by  the \nincentive tranche of subprogram 1, ASG will adopt operating guidelines on transparency in state \nbudgeting that will govern items such as off-budget borrowings and contingent liabilities with \nregard to PSEs, PSE losses and subsidies, and salary and pension arrears. Second, under \nsubprogram 1, ASG will (i) build medium-term planning over a 3- to 5-year time horizon into \nstate budget planning, preparation, and presentation to foster revenue forecasting that is not \noveroptimistic; (ii) strengthen the budget expenditure information for MTFP targets and rigorous \ncapital expenditure priorities over the medium term; as well as (iii) enhance the scrutiny of \nexpenditures consistent with the resource envelope for containing unrealistic and overoptimistic \nbudget revenue estimates and arrears on bills and dues. ASG will do this by incorporating \nupdated MTFP projections for revenue and expenditure into the state budget.  \n \n67.  Under  subprogram  1,  ASG  will  align  state  budget  reporting  to  MTFP  targets  and \nremedial action reporting needs in two ways. First, ASG will, by the second tranche, build on \ntransparency  in  budget  data  presentation  to  foster  transparency  in  state  budget  reporting \nthrough submission of state budget semiannual reports that include all key fiscal information \nrelevant  to  measurement  against  the  fiscal  responsibility  bill  (FRB)  fiscal  performance \n                                                 \n45  Parametric reform options include consideration of (i) gradual changes to the commutation factor by increasing the \nunderlying interest rate to reflect the true rate of government borrowing; (ii) a change in the base salary from the \nlast 10 months average pay to the last 3 years; and (iii) changes related to the decoupling of pensions from the \nsalaries of serving employees. The current pension scheme for government employees in Assam is a defined \nbenefit system where the pension is available after qualifying in terms of years of service, is commutable, and is \ndetermined using a wage reference. ", "18  \nindicators. Second, in terms of the comprehensiveness of state budget reporting, particularly in \nlight of reliance on central transfers, ASG will, in a phased manner, complete an inventory of all \ncentral schemes and report their up-to-date status and funding requirements through the state \nbudget. These reforms in state budget planning, preparation, presentation, and reporting, to be \ndeveloped by the FMU\u2019s budget reform cell, will form the basis for subprogram 2 indicative \ntargets of performance-orientated budgeting at the department level.  \n \n68.  The inventory of central transfers will be accomplished under a time-bound action plan of \nthe  FMU\u2019s  budget  reform  cell.  Under  such  an  action  plan,  the  budget  reform  cell  will  be \nmandated  to  annually  estimate  counterpart  funding  needs  and  determine  annual  funds \nutilization of ASG departments. Budget planning, preparation, and presentation, and budget \nreporting measures agreed under the policy matrix will be developed by the budget reform cell. \n \n69.  Enhance  Poverty-Focused  and  Growth-Oriented  Expenditure.  ASG\u2019s  current \nexpenditure  management  framework  does  not  appropriately  serve  the  effectiveness  of \ngovernment spending of existing resources focused on poverty reduction and growth consistent \nwith the MTFP targets. In terms of capital expenditures, ASG will therefore undertake two key \npolicy actions under the Program. First, given gradual increases in repressed or skewed capital \noutlay  under  the  MTFP,  ASG  will  undertake  a  rationalization  of  the  existing  portfolio  of \ndevelopment projects in Assam so that capital expenditures are directed through objective \nprioritization criteria for sectors and schemes that have the most direct impact on the poor or in \nterms of GSDP growth. An ineffective spread of capital expenditure over too many projects will \nthereby be avoided. This will result in a core investment program of development projects \nselected in accordance with objective prioritization criteria that will underpin the MTFP capital \nexpenditure targets adopted in the state budget as of FY2008. Second, to support the MTFP \ncapital expenditure targets as adopted in the state budget of FY2008, ASG will ensure related \noperation and maintenance expenditure targets are incorporated in the state budget by FY2008.   \n \n70.  Under subprogram 1, ASG will promote the quality of public expenditure in terms of \ncompliance with medium-term fiscal planning and legislatively mandated fiscal responsibility \ntargets, disciplined cash management, and timely responsiveness to audits by establishing key \nelements of a public financial MIS, in terms of reliable and comprehensive employee and \npensions data, treasury and payments information technology procurement, and state-wide \nuniform procurement standards. These reforms will form the foundation for subprogram 2 to \nimplement the core investment program and operation and maintenance targets supplemented \nby  published  departmental  performance  reports  based  on  core  investment  program  and \noperation and maintenance performance indicators, and supported by implementation of an \nintegrated public financial MIS. \n \n71.  Capital and operation and maintenance expenditure reforms and financial management, \nTreasury payments, and procurement reform measures agreed under the policy matrix will be \ndeveloped by the FMU\u2019s expenditure reform cell. \n \nc.  Component 3: Reorienting the Role of the State \n \n72.  Public Sector Enterprises Reform. A review of the PSE sector in Assam shows a \npersistently widespread picture of unproductive investments, accumulation of losses, and a slow \nbut steady leakage of public funds from ASG to the PSEs. This may be partly attributed to the \nabsence of a comprehensive enabling framework that examines PSEs beyond the immediate \nfiscal imperative in terms of restraint on government activity with no public policy justification. It \ncan also be attributed to the absence of a focused transactional program of PSE closure and ", "  19\nrestructuring. Under subprogram 1, ASG will undertake four key policy actions related to the \nenabling framework and transactional support for PSE reform to stem unproductive public \nexpenditure and contain the buildup of future liabilities and budgetary support for loss-making \nPSEs, as well as embed the foundation for fundamental restructuring of certain PSEs.  \n \n73.  First, the Program will develop a comprehensive policy framework for ASG oversight \nover its PSE investments and conduct of PSE reform. Under subprogram 1, ASG will (i) adopt \nup front a comprehensive PSE reform policy designed to provide a governance framework for \nclosure, restructuring, divestment, SSN, corporate governance, and accountability of PSEs; and \n(ii) establish a PSE reform committee and mandate the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) \nas the nodal agency for PSE reforms with subsequent measurable and transparent publication \nof PSE-related information by DPE. Second, under subprogram 1, the Program will undertake \ntransactional support for closure of at least seven identified loss-making PSEs46 through one-\ntime  settlement  of  government  guaranteed  loans  to  such  PSEs.  Subject  to  completion  of \naccounting arrears and asset valuation, initiation of the closure process for such PSEs will \ncontain ASG financial exposure to the loss-making PSEs. Third, under subprogram 1, ASG will \npromote PSE restructuring by (i) ASG acknowledgement of unfunded terminal benefit liabilities \nof ASEB, including ASG\u2019s budget reflection of such liabilities to complement the transparent \nacceptance of net ASEB liabilities under the Assam Power Sector Development Program; and \n(ii) approving and issuing corporate and financial governance rules and regulations for PSEs, \nincluding MOUs between ASG and identified PSEs whose financial and operating performance \nand corporate conduct warrant eventual restructuring or divestment. Finally, under subprogram \n1, ASG will, in a phased manner, design and fully implement a SSN program for employees of \nPSEs to be closed. The SSN program will provide communications, training, financing, and \nvocational and financial counseling. The adjustment costs related to mitigation of such PSE \nreforms in terms of a VRS and SSN will be supported through earmarked funds. These key \nactions under subprogram 1 will be the basis for further PSE closure and restructuring support \nunder subprogram 2. \n \n74.  Strengthen Public-Private Partnerships. To redress the shrinking employment and \ndelivery of public goods and services from the unsustainably poor performance of PSEs in \nAssam, ASG\u2019s role must shift from provider of goods and services to facilitator, and the private \nsector must provide alternative employment and services. Consequently, under subprogram 1, \nat a policy level, ASG will (i) establish a public-private task force to review impediments to \npromoting private investment, such as rationalization of labor, environmental and business \nestablishment-related laws, inspection procedures, licensing and regulations, and single-window \nclearance  facilities;  and  (ii)  formally  review  the  report  of  the  task  force.  Second,  at  an \ninstitutional level, ASG will (i) establish a business incubation unit and a skills development and \nplacement  unit  in  DPE  to  outsource  services  development  and  employment  training;  (ii) \noperationalize these units as part of the SSN program with PSEs; and (iii) formally review the \nfunctioning  of  these  units  in  terms  of  outcomes.  The  policy  and  institutional  actions  in \nsubprogram 1 will form the basis for indicative targets in subprogram 2 in terms of adoption of a \nprivate sector facilitation policy and related time-bound action plans.  \n \n75.  Public Administration Review. Given the fiscal stress caused by the size of the state \ncivil service and its salaries, under subprogram 1, key public administration rationalization policy \nactions will be undertaken to address ASG wages and salaries. ASG will adopt up front a public \nadministration  rationalization  policy  under  which  two  key  actions  will  be  taken.  First,  a \n                                                 \n46  The seven PSEs may include (i) Assam Conductors and Tubes; (ii) Assam Cooperative Sugar Mills; (iii) Assam \nSpun Silk Mills; (iv) Assam State Minor Irrigation Development Corporation; (v) Assam State Weaving and \nManufacturing Company; (vi) Cachar Sugar Mills; and (vii) Fertichem. ", "20  \nreplacement rate to attrition of ASG employees of 70% will be set on average for all government \ndepartments throughout the Program as part of the MTFP. To the extent the 70% replacement \nratio is not met, ASG will adopt other fiscal measures to meet the key fiscal indicators of the \nMTFP for that year47 and will meet an average of 70% over that and the subsequent year. \nSecond, under the public administration rationalization policy, ASG will enable departmental \nreplacement or recruitment in accordance with functional reviews to entitle departments to \nrecruit  replacement  staff  at  higher  levels  than  those  retiring  if  the  skills  sets  of  those \ndepartments so requires.  \n \n76.  In light of the poor performance of ASG\u2019s public administration, under subprogram 1, \nASG will address the quality of public expenditure on public administration by preparing a public \nadministration quality assessment to address two key areas related to (i) functional reviews of \nselected departments of ASG to determine an efficient and optimal mix of skill sets for improved \npersonnel management and performance orientation;48 and (ii) enhancement of anticorruption \nprocedures  and  mechanisms  for  improved  corruption  prevention  and  investigation  through \npublic expenditure tracking surveys in selected departments of ASG, as well as a review of the \nexisting anticorruption mechanisms of the state.49  \n \n77.  As  indicated  in  ADB\u2019s  participatory  poverty  assessment  for  Assam  in  2003,50  poor \nmanagement of public institutions responsible for service delivery is a major cause of poverty. \nThus improving public administration quality will have a direct impact on poverty reduction.  \n \n78.  Finally,  under  subprogram  1,  ASG  will  address  the  institutional  aspects  of  public \nadministration reform by developing a comprehensive and reliable employee database that will \nprevent  abuse  of  the  employment  system  and  form  a  cornerstone  of  reliable  expenditure \nforecasting for the MTFP and a  critical pillar of a public financial MIS for improved fiscal \ngovernance. The subprogram 1 reforms will form the basis for subprogram 2 implementation of \na public administration restructuring action plan and a performance accountability system for \ngovernment employees. \n    \n3.  Financing Plan \n79.  Program  Loan  Amount,  Terms,  and  Conditions.  The  Program  adopts  a  cluster \napproach comprising subprograms 1 and 2 totaling $225 million. The Government of India has \nrequested a loan of $125 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance the \ncost  of  reforms  under  subprogram  1  of  the  Program.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% \nper annum and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The central Government will bear the exchange risk on the \nloan,  and  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  ASG.  The  Government\u2019s  current  policy  of \nassistance to a Special Category State like Assam is a grant-loan ratio of 90:10. The program \ncosts schedule is in Appendix 6. \n                                                 \n47 There is a need to be realistic about the extent to which alternative measures could generate offsets. \n48 Functional reviews and reviews of anticorruption mechanisms will be undertaken by the Assam Administrative \nReforms Commission, building on work already commenced by the Assam Administrative Reforms Commission. \n49  Public expenditure tracking surveys will be undertaken by the expenditure reform cell of the FMU. \n50 ADB. 2002. Participatory Poverty Assessment II. Manila. ", "  21\n \n80.  Program  Cost.  Program  implementation  will  involve  structural  adjustment  costs \ntentatively estimated at $347 million51 during almost 5 years. The main components are \n \n(i)  state debt restructuring costs ($159 million), \n(ii)  cost of cash management reform ($20 million), \n(iii)  cost of containing pension liabilities ($30 million), and  \n(iv)  PSE reform costs ($138 million). \n \n81.  The total adjustment costs for subprogram I amount to $247 million of which (i) $111 \nmillion is for debt swaps under the central Government\u2019s scheme, (ii) $13 million for settlement \nof guaranteed loans of PSEs, (iii) $35 million for debt settlement or debt swaps of high interest \nfinancial institution and bank loans, (iv) $20 million for cash management reforms, (v) $30 \nmillion for settlement of outstanding liabilities of PSEs, (vi) $28 million for ASEB terminal benefit \nliabilities, and (vii) $10 million for the new ASG employee pension scheme. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Program Management \n82.  Execution  and  Implementation  Arrangements.  ASG  will  be  responsible  for  the \neffective administration and utilization of program loan proceeds and the counterpart funds. \nASG will appoint the Finance Department as the Executing Agency. The program steering \ncommittee will be responsible for overall coordination, implementation, monitoring, and policy \napprovals of the Program and will assist the Finance Department and report to the chief minister \nand the Cabinet on the Program. The steering committee will be headed by the chief secretary \nand will include all principal secretaries and commissioners of departments participating under \nthe Program as well as the Finance Department.   \n \n83.  A  state-level  empowered  committee,  chaired  by  an  additional  chief  secretary  and \ncomprising all principal secretaries and commissioners of departments incurring material public \nexpenditure, will monitor public administration review requirements under the Program. A PSE \nreform committee will be responsible for monitoring the progress of PSE reforms under the \nProgram. The PSE reform committee will be chaired by an additional chief secretary and include \nall principal secretaries and commissioners of line departments responsible for PSEs, PSE \nrepresentatives, as well as DPE and the Finance Department. DPE will be the committee\u2019s \nsecretariat. A public-private partnership task force consisting of labor, management, private \nsector, civil society, and ASG representatives, will be responsible for developing policy actions \nfor private sector facilitation and alternative business and employment opportunities in the \nprivate sector. It will report to the PSE reform committee. The program steering committee, the \nstate-level empowered committee, PSE reform committee, and public-private task force will \nmeet at least quarterly. \n \n84.  ASG will establish the FMU in the Finance Department under the program steering \ncommittee.  The FMU  will undertake management of fiscal responsibility, debt, and central \ntransfers, and be responsible for daily implementation of the Program under the guidance of the \nsteering committee. The FMU will coordinate with ADB and various stakeholders and solicit \nfeedback from experts from within and outside Assam on a regular basis. The responsibilities of \nthe  five  FMU  reform  cells  (para.  48)  are  outlined  in  the  policy  matrix.  The  program \nimplementation organization chart is in Appendix 7.   \n                                                 \n51  Subprogram 2 will likely have additional ASG-borne adjustment costs. ", "22  \n \nb.  Period of Implementation \n85.  Subprogram 1 is expected to be completed in about 2.5 years from December 2004 to \nJune 2007 taking due account of the state electoral calendar in 2006. Based on progress under \nsubprogram 1, the proposal for subprogram 2 is expected to be submitted for separate Board \nconsideration before the end of 2007. \n \nc.  Procurement and Disbursement \n86.  The loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and \ntaxes) of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  8)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement will be through normal commercial practices in the case of procurement by the \nprivate sector, or prescribed procedures acceptable to ADB in the case of procurement by the \npublic sector, with due regard for the principles of economy and efficiency.   \n \n87.  In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed to the central Government as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will \nbe required if, during each year, in which program loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, \nthe value of the central Government\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor greater than the program loan amount expected to be disbursed during such year. The \ncentral Government will, however, certify with each withdrawal request its compliance with this \nformula. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. Loan \nproceeds may be used to finance eligible imports for which expenditures were incurred 180 \ndays before the program loan becomes effective. \n \nd.  Counterpart Funds \n88.  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the costs of structural adjustment under the \nProgram, including the establishment of particular funds such as for the new employee pension \nscheme, debt swapping and settlement, and the State Renewal Fund for PSE reforms, which \nwill be held in accounts to be agreed with ADB. The rupee counterpart funds to be generated \nout of the program loan proceeds will be transferred by the central Government to ASG. The \ncounterpart proceeds will be treated as an addition to the transfers allocated annually from the \ncentral Government to ASG. \n \ne.  Monitoring and Tranching   \n89.  The loan under subprogram 1 will be disbursed in three installments based on meeting \nspecified tranche release conditions. The achievement targets represent such tranche release \nconditions and their accomplishment will be measured by a review of policy actions. Under \nsubprogram 1, policy and institutional development commitments must be signaled in the first \ntranche. This is followed by an incentive tranche, which translates first tranche commitment \nsignals  into  sufficiently  unequivocal  commitments  on  key  reforms.  The  incentive  tranche \nbalances the need to take account of capacity constraints in ASG with the need to ensure that \nkey  policy  and  institutional  actions  are  not  too  long  delayed,  given  potential  external \nenvironment uncertainties, including forthcoming state elections around mid 2006. This provides \na foundation for subsequent implementation of policy and institutional reforms in the second \ntranche. The incentive tranche provides for flexibility based on progress made on commitments ", "  23\ntailored to ASG since it can be released at any point during subprogram 1 when ASG is in \ncompliance with the incentive tranche requirements. The loan under subprogram 2 is tentatively \nintended to be released through two equal tranches, and the policy matrix (Appendix 3) provides \na list of indicative milestones expected to be achieved at the end of subprogram 2. \n \n90.  Subprogram 1 tranching will provide program loan resources equivalent to $125 million, \nwhich will be divided into a first tranche of $45 million to be disbursed upon loan effectiveness \nand ASG compliance with all prior actions under the Program; an incentive tranche of $45 \nmillion to be disbursed upon satisfactory compliance with all incentive tranche conditions; and a \nsecond tranche of $35 million to be disbursed by December 2006 upon satisfactory compliance \nof the corresponding second tranche conditions. Subprogram 2 is expected to provide loan \nresources of $100 million through two equal installments of $50 million each. \n \nf.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n91.  The central Government and ASG will maintain accurate records of accounts. ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of program loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the \ncentral Government\u2019s certification of withdrawals.  \n \ng.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n92.  ASG will operate a system to monitor and evaluate the results being attained by the \nProgram using the targets, indicators, monitoring mechanisms, and assumptions and risks in \nthe  program  framework.  The  FMU  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  the  program  steering \ncommittee, which will be made available to ADB and published. Not later than 3 months after \nprogram completion, ASG will provide ADB with a program report, including an assessment of \noverall program performance. ASG and ADB will carry out periodic reviews of the Program \nbased on reports; such reviews will include tracking the fiscal indicators under the MTFP.  \n \nh.  Program Review  \n93.  ASG and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review of the Program in the last \nquarter  of  2005.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  program  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements;  (ii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  program \nperformance  indicators  and  objectives;  (iii)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  legal \ncovenants; and (iv) identify problems and constraints. If the midterm review determines that \nchanges are required in program implementation, ASG and ADB will agree on measures, \nincluding changes in implementation arrangements, to ensure that program obligations are met. \nSatisfactory progress in the review for the second tranche release of subprogram 1 will be the \ntrigger for processing subprogram 2. ASG and ADB will carry out a final review at the conclusion \nof subprogram 1.  \n \nD.  The Project Loan \n1.  Objectives \n94.  Objective. The objective of the Project is to enhance ASG\u2019s capacity to accomplish the \npolicy and institutional reforms under the Program.  \n ", "24  \n2.  Components and Outputs \n95.  The scope of the Project in terms of outputs is to support (i) assessments, analytical \nstudies, and strategies for key policy reform areas addressed in the Program; (ii) capacity \nbuilding  in  key  institutions  responsible  for  public  finance,  fiscal  governance,  and  public \nadministration and service delivery across various activities to improve fiscal performance and \nenhance  governance;52  (iii)  development  and  implementation  of  a  new  integrated  public \nfinancial  MIS,  and  information  technology  support  for  composite  check  posts  to  enhance \ncapacity, efficiency, and effectiveness of public finance institutions of ASG; and (iv) public \nawareness underpinning required for sustainability of all reforms. The Project will, for example, \nsupport strategic reviews and assessments for analytical underpinning of key policy reforms, \nsuch  as  a  user  fees  policy,  public  administration  quality  assessment,  and  private  sector \ndevelopment.  Critical  policy  reform  areas  depend  on  institutional  developments  being \nappropriately supported by the Project. Capacity-building support will, for example, therefore \nunderpin (i) budget mechanisms and processes incorporating MTFP projections in anticipation \nof  introduction  of  a  fiscal  responsibility  legislation;  (ii)  functional  refocusing  of  sales  tax \nadministration in anticipation of VAT and post-VAT audit, and information and communication \ntechnology  training  assistance  geared  to  a  self-compliance  regime;  (iii)  pension  liability \nestimation and database creation and maintenance, underpinning introduction of a predictable \nand quantifiable contributory pension scheme; (iv) operationalization of the key fiscal monitoring \nand review institution of the reform program, i.e., the FMU; (v) MIS support for operationalizing \ncomposite check posts; and (vi) accounting backlog clearance and verification of assets and \nliabilities of PSEs prior to introducing the VRS.  \n \n96.  The specific components of the Project are (i) coordination, (ii) capacity building to \nreform state finances, (iii) capacity building for fiscal governance reforms, (iv) capacity building \nto reorient the role of the state, (v) provision of public finance information technology, (vi) \nconduct of training programs, and (vii) provision of public awareness programs.  \n \n97.  The details of the Project\u2019s analytical assessment, capacity building, skills enhancement, \nand procurement-based support to ASG under the various project components are linked to \nsubprogram 1 incentive and second tranches.53 The Project will also support indicative outputs \nof  subprogram  2.

The central Government and ASG have been advised that \nsuch advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \nc.  Procurement and Disbursement \n102.  Procurement.  The  computer  hardware  and  software  for  the  information  technology \ncomponent  of  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost the equivalent \nof more than $1,000,000 will be procured through international competitive bidding. The public \nfinancial MIS equipment will be procured on a turnkey basis through international competitive \nbidding as an integrated system of information and communication technology. The computer \nhardware and software required for computerized financial control and management systems in \nthe sales tax, excise, and transport departments to validate and cross check composite check-\npost information will be procured through international shopping. Details of the procurement \npackages are provided in Appendix 10. \n \n103.  Disbursement  Arrangements.  Since  the  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be \nmainly for equipment supply and international consulting services, ADB\u2019s commitment letter and \ndirect  payment  procedures  will  be  used  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Loan \nDisbursement (January 2001) and ADB\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Disbursement of Operations, \nLIBOR-based Loan Projects (July 2002) as amended from time to time. \n \nd.  Consulting Services \n104.  The  Project  will  require  a  459  person-months  of  consulting  services,  including  153 \nperson-months  of  international  and  306  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services. \nConsulting services for the coordination consultants component will be provided by a firm \nselected through quality-based selection or individual consultants recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The coordination consultants will ensure quality control by \nundertaking  30%  of  the  total  person-months  of  the  consulting  services  for  all  project \ncomponents; facilitating recruitment of consultants and procurement; and managing consultants. \nSeparate subcontracting of the services of individual consultants or firms may be required for \nother project components. Consulting services for such other components will be provided \nthrough  quality  and  cost-based  selection  by  one  or  more  consulting  firms  or  individual \nconsultants recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. For selecting \nconsulting firms, simplified technical proposals will be used where possible and appropriate. The \nterms of reference of the coordination consultants are provided in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n ", "  27\ne.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n105.  Accounting  and  Auditing.  The  Finance  Department  will  establish  and  maintain \nseparate accounts and records for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles, \nand  will  have  such  accounts  and  records  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  standards \nacceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements, and the \nreport of the auditors will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the close of the \nfiscal year to which they relate.   \n \n106.  Project Reports. Each project component will be implemented in three phases. During \nthe inception phase, the consultants of the various components will revalidate the objectives \nand  assess  priorities,  key  issues,  and  capacity-building  needs.  At  the  end  of  this  phase, \nresource inputs may be adjusted, as appropriate, within the overall budget and project scope, to \nbetter align the terms of reference, activities, and outputs with client expectations and needs. \nDuring the  design phase, the consultants will formulate in detail the capacity-building and \noperational  development  plans.  Finally,  in  the  implementation  phase,  the  consultants  will \ndocument required regulations, procedures, and systems, as well as arrange for training and \nskill development, as appropriate. \n \n107.  The consultants for each component will prepare (i) an inception report, within 2 months \nof service commencement, to fine tune and detail the work program and establish time-bound \noutputs; (ii) medium-term review reports 1 and 2 at the end of 18 months and 36 months; (iii) a \ndraft final report with complete documentation at the end of 52 months; and (iv) a final report at \nproject completion, after incorporating comments of ADB, the central Government, and ASG. \n \n108.  The FMU will submit quarterly reports on the Project to ADB within 1 month of the end of \neach quarter in accordance with ADB\u2019s project performance management system guidelines. \nThe reports will contain a narrative description of progress made during the period, changes to \nthe  implementation  schedule  if  any,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered  and  the  remedial \nactions taken, the performance of the project consultants where applicable, and the work to be \ncarried out in the upcoming period. The reports will include a summary financial account for the \nProject, consisting of project expenditure to date. A project completion report will be submitted \nto ADB within 3 months of project completion. \n \nf.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n109.  In addition to regular and ongoing interaction of the Finance Department, ADB, and its \nconsultants, ASG and ADB will periodically review project implementation based on quarterly \nreports of the FMU and consultant reports. The reviews will include evaluation of project scope, \nimplementation arrangements, consultations with the Finance Department and FMU, progress \nwith the policy reform agenda, and capacity-building measures. \n \ng.  Project Review  \n110.  In  addition  to  regular  ADB  reviews,  two  comprehensive  midterm  reviews  will  be \nundertaken 18 and 36 months after commencement of the Project to evaluate all aspects of \nimplementation. Based on this review, modifications and improvements will be considered. \n ", "28  \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n111.  Overall. The Program is expected to yield material benefits to the population in Assam, \nincluding the 36% who are poor by supporting (i) the generation of fiscal space for increased \nspending  on  social  sector  expenditure  to  reduce  poverty  and  growth-inducing  capital \nexpenditure  on  infrastructure;  (ii)  improved  fiscal  governance  for  effective  utilization  and \nprioritization  of  existing  resources  to  increase  GSDP  growth  and  reduce  poverty;  and  (iii) \nimprovements  in  the  rationalization  and  quality  of  public  expenditure,  and  creation  of  an \nenabling environment for improved opportunities for sustainable employment and growth.   \n \n112.  Creation of Sustainable Fiscal Resources. Benefits will accrue over the medium term \nlinked  to  the  policy  matrix  and  the  MTFP.  Several  actions  under  the  policy  matrix  for \nsubprogram 1 are specifically designed to create benefits. Thus, the various deficit reduction \nfiscal policy actions anchored by the MTFP and the restructuring of debt utilizing loan proceeds \nwill enable an additional creation of fiscal space in a sustainable manner that can be utilized for \ntargeted growth-inducing and poverty-reducing public expenditure.  \n \n113.  Strengthened Growth-Orientated and Poverty-Reduction Projects. The benefit of \neffective utilization of additional fiscal space for poverty reduction and growth will result from \nsubprogram 1\u2019s fiscal governance component under which a core investment program will \nobjectively prioritize capital outlay on development projects that have the most significant impact \non poverty reduction or growth.  \n \n114.  Strengthened ASG Operations. The core governance component of subprogram 1 will \nresult in the benefits of (i) containment of staff costs in the interests of growth and poverty \nreduction focused public expenditure; (ii) a results-based, responsive, and performance-oriented \nstate government; and (iii) the additional employment, growth, and income generation resulting \nfrom a public-private partnership. \n \nB.  Impacts \n115.  Poverty Impact. The Program\u2019s policy and institutional reforms are expected to overall \nhave a positive impact on poverty reduction. The Program mitigates potential adverse poverty \nimpacts in three ways. First, in terms of PSE reform, the Program\u2019s support for closure of 7 \nPSEs will entail a VRS-SSN program. The closure of these PSEs will not lead to loss of regular \nemployment as these units are already inoperative. Second, the Program will mitigate any short-\nterm  deterioration  of  household  spending  of  pensioners  by  containing  unfunded  pension \nliabilities in the long run on behalf of all government employees. In any event, the Program will \nnot affect the current targeted social security arrangements for the poor, such as old age \npensions. Third, the Program will implement a user fees policy only after a careful strategic \nreview to assess possible adverse impacts on the poor in terms of access and affordability for \nthe poor and targeted protection for the poor. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 11. The matrix on poverty impact and mitigation assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \n116.  Environmental, Involuntary Resettlement, and Impact on Indigenous People. The \nProgram will not have any direct or immediate environmental impacts (Supplementary Appendix \nH). The Program will help implement and streamline clear application of existing laws against \nenvironmental pollution resulting from the public-private taskforce review of environmental laws, ", "  29\nrules,  and  regulations.  The  Program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples\u2019 policies. \n \nC.  Risks \n1.  The Program  \n117.  Political Risks. Assam has a history of insurgency and law and order problems. Assam \nhas experienced a series of political and social challenges during the last 5 to 6 decades. The \nstate has shown great resilience in the face of insurgency accentuated by the partition of the \ncountry  in  1947,  demographic  changes  and  reorganization  of  the  state  in  1972  against  a \nbackdrop of economic deceleration. The Program is providing a complementary growth-oriented \nprogram to the steps already taken by ASG to contain insurgency and law and order problems \nthrough  the  Assam  Accord  of  1985  and  the  recent  Bodo  Accord  of  February  2003.  The \nProgram\u2019s policy actions are structured through first and incentive tranches to achieve critical \nresults early given the state electoral calendar in 2006. In addition, the accomplishment of \nsubprogram 1 policy actions will set the stage for deepening of policy reforms in subprogram 2 \nafter the state elections.   \n \n118.  To  mitigate  the  risks  of  misinformation  and  lack  of  clear  communication  about  the \nimplications  of  the  Program  to  key  stakeholders,  the  Program  includes  measures  to  build \nconsensus and strong stakeholder support through a comprehensive communications strategy, \nincluding an annual Assam development forum.  \n \n119.  Bureaucratic  and  Legislative  Risks.  The  Program  aims  to  increase  transparency \nthrough  fiscal  and  fiscal  governance  reforms;  and  enhance  government  performance, \naccountability, responsiveness, and vigilance through core governance reforms. Those opposed \nto such a process could seek to impede the reforms and delay legislative enactment. To \nmitigate such risks, strong ownership at the highest political and bureaucratic levels is built into \nthe Program and its implementation arrangements. Key institutional actions are to precede \nlegislation. In addition, capacity building and public awareness, through the attached Project, \nwill help foster reform champions within the system. \n \n2.  The Project  \n120.  Institutional  Risks.  The  Program\u2019s  comprehensive  nature  will  place  considerable \ndemands on ASG\u2019s weak institutional capacities. ASG has only limited experience with this type \nof fiscal and governance reform programs. To mitigate these risks, significant capacity building \nand systems support are built into the Program through the Project. In addition, the Project will \ninclude performance benchmarks to track institutional performance.  \n \n121.  Implementation Risks. Close performance monitoring will help reduce the adverse \neffects of implementation delays due to capacity constraints. The FMU will draw on lessons \nlearned from other programs. Implementation delays caused by frequent changes of personnel \nwill be mitigated through assurances on continuity. \n  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n122.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  ASG  have  given  the \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. ", "30  \n \n1.  The Program Loan \n123.  Assurances for the program loan include the following: \n \n(i)  The Government and ASG will ensure that the achievements met and policy \nactions adopted as set forth in the policy letter and the policy matrix will continue \nto be in full force and effect for the duration of the program period, and ensure \nthe sustainability of the reforms beyond the program period. \n(ii)  The Government will transfer the counterpart funds generated under the program \nloan under the normal arrangements for transferring external assistance to ASG, \nand  will  treat  such  counterpart  funds  as  additional  to  its  transfers  allocated \nannually to the State of Assam. ASG will use these counterpart funds to finance \nstructural adjustment under the Program for the (a) ASG debt restructuring costs, \n(b) cost of cash management reform, (c) cost of containing pension liabilities of \nASG, (d) cost of ASG acknowledgement of unfunded ASEB terminal benefit \nliabilities, and (e) PSE reform costs. \n(iii)  ASG will establish a program steering committee chaired by the chief secretary \nof ASG to oversee all fiscal and governance reforms under the program loan. \n(iv)  By April 2005, ASG will approve the operating guidelines and structure for the \nprudential management and discharge of the state renewal fund. \n(v)  By October 2005, ASG will establish a SSN unit supervised by the DPE to be \nresponsible for developing an SSN program for employees of PSEs to be closed. \nThe SSN program will include a communication program, training, financing, \nvocational, and financial counseling for employees of PSEs to be closed. The \nSSN  program  will  be  developed  in  consultation  with  relevant  stakeholders, \nincluding employees of PSEs. \n(vi)  ASG will submit a compliance report to the Cabinet on compliance with MTFP \nparameters  prior  to  introduction  of  the  fiscal  responsibility  bill  in  the  State\u2019s \nLegislative Assembly. \n(vii)  ASG  will  ensure  that  in  carrying  out  the  policy  actions  included  under  the \nProgram and the policy matrix, due consideration will be given to the findings and \nrecommendations of the Project. \n(viii)  ASG  will  undertake  a  subprogram  review  in  consultation  with  ADB  prior  to \nrelease of tranche 2 under subprogram 1 and formulation of subprogram 2. \nSatisfactory progress in the subprogram review will precede any decision to \nproceed with subprogram 2. \n \n2.  The Project Loan \n124.  Assurances for the project loan include the following: \n \n(i)  ADB, ASG, and the Government will undertake two comprehensive reviews of \nthe Project 18 months and 36 months after its commencement. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n125.  The following conditions for loan effectiveness will be incorporated into the Program \nLoan Agreement: (i) The Project Loan Agreement will have been duly executed and delivered \non behalf of the central Government, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other \nthan those requiring the effectiveness of the Program Loan Agreement) will have been fulfilled; ", "  31\nand (ii) the ASG shall (a) acknowledge the total and annualized quantum of the unfunded ASEB \nterminal benefit liabilities, and (b) submit updated MTFP figures taking into account such ASEB \nterminal benefit liabilities. \n \n126.  The following condition for loan effectiveness will be incorporated into the Project Loan \nAgreement: The Program Loan Agreement will have been duly executed and delivered on \nbehalf of the central Government, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than \nthose requiring the effectiveness of the Project Loan Agreement) will have been fulfilled. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n127.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the program cluster concept of $225,000,000 for the Assam Governance and \nPublic Resource Management Sector Development Program in India; \n(ii)  the  loan  of  $125,000,000  to  India  for  the  Assam  Governance  and  Public \nResource Management Subprogram 1 of the Assam Governance and Public \nResource  Management  Sector  Development  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements presented to the \nBoard; and \n(iii)  the loan of $25,000,000 to India for the Assam Governance and Public Resource \nManagement Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and \nProject Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n              Tadao Chino \n                  President  \n \n \n25 November 2004 ", "32   Appendix 1 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n A.  Background and Recent Performance \n \n1.  Fiscal. The fiscal health of Assam deteriorated sharply during the last decade. The \naverage revenue, fiscal, and primary deficits in the 1990s were significantly higher than that of \nthe 1980s.1 This was exacerbated by a sharp increase in revenue expenditures in fiscal year \n(FY)1999 due to pay and pension revisions.2 Following these revisions, the hardening budget \nconstraint forced the Assam state government (ASG) to adopt measures to tackle the deficits. \nASG was able to steadily improve the fiscal health of the state.3  \n \n2.  However,  these  improvements  in  the  fiscal  situation  in  Assam  were  undertaken  by \nsteadily crowding out capital expenditures from 4.3% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in \nFY1992 to 1.7% in FY2003 with adverse effects on infrastructure availability and the future \ngrowth potential of the state. To meet the growing gap between rising revenue expenditure and \nslowing revenue growth, the burden of indebtedness of the state increased steadily from about \n24% of GSDP in FY1996 to 36% by FY2002. With the move away from financial repression, \ninterest rates increased sharply after FY1994, and ASG\u2019s poor cash management added to the \ninterest burden. The average rate of interest on ASG\u2019s borrowing increased from 7% in the early \n1990s to around 10.5% in FY2002. With the state\u2019s economy growing at a much slower rate, \nhigher  interest  rates  made  the  situation  increasingly  unsustainable  with  interest  payments \ngrowing  at  17%  per  annum  during  the  1990s.  Consequently,  the  fiscal  picture  in  Assam \ncontinues to be worrisome. \n \n3.  Fiscal  Governance.  In  terms  of  fiscal  governance,  the  weaknesses  in  financial \nmanagement and state budgeting are evidenced in the ineffective use of existing resources \nincluding central transfers. For example, in FY2003, the Rural Development Ministry of the \ncentral  Government  allocated  Rs4.25  billion  of  grants  for  various  rural  poverty  reduction \nschemes. However only Rs3.61 billion, or 85%, of the allocated sum were actually released. \nASG was to provide Rs1.41billion of counterpart funding, but could only contribute Rs0.27 \nbillion. \n \n4.  Core Governance. Despite the efforts of ASG to control the overall number of ASG \nemployees by freezing recruitment and promotion, except with the approval of the State-Level \nEmpowered Committee,4 and to increase the delegation of authority, concerns about public \nadministration-related expenditure and the organizational structure and performance of public \nadministration in terms of the required quality of public expenditure continue. According to the \nAssam  Administrative  Reforms  Commission  reports  of  2003  and  2004,  ASG  is  unable  to \neffectively fulfill its core functions as a result of misaligned organizational structures; inadequate \nskills and incentives; and poor human resource management, performance, and accountability. \n \n5.  Public  sector  enterprise  (PSE)  performance  problems  characterize  many  state \ngovernments in India. While ASG has initiated reform efforts for individual PSEs like Assam \nState Electricity Board (ASEB) and Assam State Transport Corporation, the overall financial \n                                                           \n1  As a ratio of gross state domestic product, the fiscal deficit was 2.09% in FY1992 and worsened to 3.36% in \nFY1996. \n2  A revenue surplus of 2.21% in FY1992 deteriorated to a 3.55% deficit in FY2000 after the pay and pensions \nrevisions. \n3  As a percentage of GSDP, the revenue deficit was reduced from 3.5% in FY2000 to 1.4% in FY2003, and the fiscal \ndeficit improved during this period from 5.7% to 3.1%. \n4  The overall number of ASG employees has been reduced from 459,701 to 429,627 from FY1999 to FY2004. ", "  Appendix 1  33  \nperformance  of  the  PSEs  in  Assam,  including  ASEB,  in  terms  of  percentage  of  loss  to \ncumulative government investment, is substantially worse than in other states. For Assam, this \nis a loss of 1.6 times; no other state among the 17 reviewed by the Ministry of Disinvestment of \nthe central Government had a ratio of loss to cumulative investment exceeding 100% (using \nFY2002 data). \n \nB.  Resource Mobilization \n \n6.  Own Tax Revenue. The major tax sources for Assam, as a percentage of own-tax \nrevenue, are sales tax (74%), state excise duties (6%), motor vehicle tax (6%), stamp duty and \nregistration fees (3%), and land revenue (3%). However, given that central transfers constitute \n67% of the total revenues of ASG, own-tax revenue collections of ASG only account for 26% of \nthe total revenue receipts. This limits the extent of resource mobilization from own-tax revenue. \nNevertheless, tax policy and administration weaknesses are limiting own-tax revenue growth. \nThus, although the quantum of total own-tax revenue collections has increased from Rs1 billion \nto over Rs15.5 billion during the 20-years beginning FY1982, with an annual growth rate of over \n15.5%  per  annum,  the  actual  recorded  growth  rates  have  fluctuated  considerably  from  a \nnegative 1.5% to a positive 40%. Consequently, while the long-term average growth rate is \n15.5%, evidence of a decline is illustrated by the average growth in the 1990s at 13.8% as \ncompared with 17.7% in the 1980s.  \n \n7.  Revenue productivity of the tax system has increased substantially over the last 3 years. \nThe revenue-GSDP ratio increased sharply from 4.3% in FY2000 to 5.3% in FY2003. However, \nindividual tax revenue-GSDP ratios are not stable over time. For instance, taxes on agricultural \nincome used to account for over 7% in FY1982, but have recorded a sustained decline in recent \nyears and accounted for only 0.1% of total tax collections in FY2003. Tax policy reforms are \nneeded. The demerger of sales tax on liquor from excise in 2002 will likely have a negative \nimpact on revenue buoyancy in the future; the annual growth rate of stamps and registration \nfees is declining;5 and capture of the services sector in the sales tax system is not sufficient. \n \n8.  A major reason for the decelerating trend in the growth of taxes, apart from the slow \ngrowth of the economy, is the serious administrative and compliance issues. Since FY2000, \nrevenue collections from own taxes in the state have improved significantly. This is mainly due \nto  concerted  efforts  to  improve  both  the  structure  and  operation  of  the  sales  tax  system, \nincluding efforts to clear the arrears. However, most of the neighboring states act as tax havens \nresulting in significant evasion and avoidance of taxes. In this context, ASG has been taking \nsome initiatives to spearhead a move to increase coordination among the northeastern states. A \nstep in this direction was a recent meeting of the finance ministers of these states to build \nconsensus on sales tax-related issues. The efforts, however, need to be expanded through \ninstitutional reforms, such as composite check posts. In addition, functional reforms in major \nindividual tax administration like sales tax administration are required. \n \n9.  Nontax Revenues. The growth rate of ASG\u2019s own nontax revenues declined sharply \nduring the 1990s compared with the 1980s. The average growth rate of nontax revenues \ndeclined from 17% during the 1980s to a mere 4% during the 1990s. Important nontax revenues \nconsist of royalty on crude oil, revenue from forest, and user charges and fees on various public \nservices provided. The state has very limited control over royalty rates and the ban on logging \nand movement of trucks in reserved forests imposed by a Supreme Court of India order has \nsignificantly reduced forest revenues. However, the nontax revenue from other sectors that are \n                                                           \n5  This declined from 16% in the 1980s to 14% in the 1990s. ", "34   Appendix 1 \nwithin the control of the state is marginal with collection in the irrigation sector being only Rs5 \nmillion. Assam does not have a prevalent system of user charges for roads and bridges. \nConsequently, it does not have any income from tolls; other receipts for roads and bridges have \nfluctuated between Rs0.03 billion and Rs3.95 billion from FY1999 to FY2003. These receipts \nare essentially the \u201cagency charges\u201d paid to the Public Works Department by the Ministry of \nRoad Transport & Highways for  management  of capital/maintenance works undertaken by \nPublic  Works  Department  on  its  behalf.  Contribution  of  user  fees  to  finance  health  care \nexpenditure is about 2%, although medical college hospitals report a higher user fee collection. \nIn the education sector, the revenue receipts were about Rs9.8 million.  \n \nC.  Expenditure Management \n \n10.  Expenditure  Management  Reform  Path.  Limits  to  resource  mobilization  in  Assam \nmean that expenditure management is key to accomplishing fiscal consolidation in the state. \nHowever, sustainable fiscal consolidation6 can only be achieved over the medium term in \nAssam  by  building  on  a  set  of  fiscal  stabilization  measures  on  expenditure  management \nencompassing key institutional foundation stones on employee and pension databases and \ntreasury systems for improved cash management, debt swaps and settlements accompanied by \na debt inventory, enhanced budget reporting, and a central transfers inventory. An assessment \nof  the  state\u2019s  expenditure  management  issues  shows  that  these  measures  need  to  be \naccompanied  by  appropriately  focused  fiscal  and  fiscal  governance  capacity  building  and \ninstitutional strengthening given Assam\u2019s institutional challenges. \n \n11.  Salaries, Wages, and Pensions. ASG currently spends as much as 45.19% of total \nexpenditures on salaries for its regular employees, 3.21% on salaries for employees in fully \naided  educational  institutions,  and  another  9.84%  on  pensions  (including  other  retirement \nbenefits) to its employees. A review of the employee and salary expenditure numbers for the \nlast 5 years (FY2000 to FY2004) reveals that while the number of ASG\u2019s regular employees \ndecreased by 6.54% during this period (from 459,701 to 429,627), the salary expenditure on \nthese employees increased by 52.57%. This means that the reduction in the number of regular \nemployees was more than offset by the increase in the average salary per employee. The \naverage salary per employee increased by 63.26%, the major spikes being on account of ASG\u2019s \npayments to implement the central Government\u2019s Fifth Pay Commission recommendations. \nConsequently, continued action on containing the overall size of the government bureaucracy \nthrough public administration rationalization is important as is a medium-term reform path for \ncompression of wages and salaries expenditure and linked benefits7 to release resources to \nfinance more productive expenditure.  \n \n12.  Debt. The resources available to ASG have not increased concurrent with the increase \nin expenditure commitments. This has resulted in an increase in revenue deficit, which in turn \n                                                           \n6  A review of ongoing programs shows that deep expenditure management reforms, such as public administration \nand enterprise restructuring and parametric pensions reforms, cannot be sustained if they are pursued early in a \nreform program without institutional measures as part of fiscal stabilization. \n7  Pensions and other retirement benefits are linked to wages and salaries, and are a material factor in rising revenue \nexpenditure. They have grown from 9% of revenue expenditures in FY1994 to approximately 13% in FY2003. The \nnumber of pensioners grew from 75,999 in FY1998 to 135,549 in FY2003, representing an average growth of 12%. \nPensions are provided to government employees under a defined benefit plan financed by the current revenues of \nthe state with no contributions either from the current workers or government to finance these liabilities. All state \ngovernment employees are entitled to retirement benefits, which include a monthly basic pension  with full \nindexation to wage and price changes, dearness relief, a family pension, gratuity, and leave encashment. \nPensioners are also entitled to commute a portion of their pension.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  35  \nhas compelled ASG to borrow to meet its revenue expenditure. The state plan has also grown \non an incremental basis out of step with growth in resources, compelling ASG to avail of high \ncost borrowings. The growth in debt has largely followed the level of revenue deficits of the \nstate. The large and increasing gross fiscal deficit of ASG has led to a steady accumulation of \noutstanding  debt.  The  increasing  debt  stock  of  Assam  has  led  to  an  increase  in  interest \npayments. From FY1988 to FY2003, while the outstanding debt increased 4.8 times, interest \npayments grew by 13.6% annually or 6.74 times. Debt swaps have resulted in interest savings \nfor the state that would help reduce the revenue deficit strain, but not the debt stock, which \nwould require an accelerated timetable of institutional loan settlements. \n \n13.  Cash Management. Prudent cash management has been lacking, with ASG incurring \nlarge expenditures on interest payment on ways and means advances taken from the Reserve \nBank of India to tide over short-term cash requirements. During FY2003, the state was in an \noverdraft position for 287 days, and for 154 working days the payments remained suspended. In \nFY2002, ASG incurred interest expenditure of Rs1.39 billion on ways and means advances and \noverdrafts. Besides taking the precious time of senior officials away from proper fiscal planning, \nthis brings uncertainty and inefficiency in expenditure implementation. Strengthening the cash \nmanagement system is of critical importance, not only to reduce the interest burden on ASG, \nbut also to reduce the cost of delivering public services.  \n \n14.  Budget,  Financial  Management,  and  Capacity  Building.  While  reorientation  to \nmultiyear fiscal forecasting and output-based and performance-oriented budgeting is a medium-\nterm  prospect  in  Assam,  the  strengthening  of  systems  and  capacity  and  comprehensive \nemployee, pensions, debt, and cash management data is critical for the success of the fiscal \nstabilization thrust of subprogram 1. This explains the front-loaded thrust of capacity-building \nsupport under the project loan in these areas to underpin the accomplishment of these goals by \nthe end of 2006. By contrast, the deeper expenditure management reforms, such as reforms on \npublic  administration  and  enterprise  restructuring  and  parametric  pension  reform,  will  be \nsupported  through  back-loaded  capacity-building  support  and  integration  of  public  financial \nmanagement information systems and automated settlement processes under the project loan \nfrom 2007 onward. \n \nD.  Expenditure Orientation \n \n15.  Expenditure  Orientation  Reform  Path.  The  fiscal  stabilization  path  of  the  first \nsubprogram will entail a focus on a public expenditure review process as a key element of fiscal \ngovernance  measures.  Such  a  process  will  entail  both  prioritization  of  capital  outlay  and \norientation to operation and maintenance expenditure away from salaries and wages. This will \nculminate in a core investment program and operation and maintenance targets under the \nmedium-term fiscal plan. The latter needs to anchor functional reviews of ASG\u2019s expenditure \ndepartments if any sustainable results are to be achieved from a functional review for medium-\nterm public administration restructuring. The core investment program will be implemented over \nthe medium term and aligned to gradual increases in capital outlay for critical economic growth \nin the state. A review of current sector expenditure patterns in certain key selected sectors \nexplains the importance of this phased approach for Assam given the magnitude of current \nexpenditure orientation problems. \n \n16.  Education. For example, from FY2004, an annual investment of Rs3.5 billion to 4 billion \nis expected under the Sarva Shiksha Mission (a centrally sponsored scheme with a 75:25 \nsharing pattern between the central Government and ASG. This will change to 50:50 from the \nnext  5-year  plan  that  will  commence  from  April  2007).  However,  given  ASG\u2019s  precarious \nfinancial condition, it is likely to be constrained in providing the requisite state share. This could ", "36   Appendix 1 \njeopardize the implementation of the Sarva Shiksha Mission, which is the biggest investment for \nuniversal elementary education in the state.  \n \n17.  Health.  The  trend  of  budgetary  allocation  to  the  health  sector  in  Assam  shows  a \ncontinuous decline. One notable feature is the decline in plan allocation from 50% in FY1998 to \n30.1%  in  FY2003.  This  indicates  that  development  activities  concerning  health  are  being \ncontinuously downsized given salary expenditures. A breakdown of government expenditure on \nhealth suggests that the nonsalary component suffered the most because of the decline in \nbudgetary share.  \n \n18.  Transport. ASG\u2019s transport sector illustrates the deleterious effects of lack of adequate \ncapital  expenditure  and  project  prioritization  leading  to  unbalanced  and  inefficient  capital \nexpenditure allocations. From FY1999 to FY2003, capital expenditure increased as a whole \nfrom Rs1.37 billion to Rs1.86 billion. However, the dominant share of that expenditure was on \nroads  and  bridges  with  the  balance  being  on  road  transport  (i.e.,  Assam  State  Transport \nCorporation) with no capital outlay on inland water transport. For roads and bridges, most of the \ncapital outlay was on rural roads with a small quantum on state highways and major district \nroads  leading  to  a  capital  expenditure  backlog  of  Rs500  billion.  This  meant  that  capital \ninvestment planning was insufficient for capital expenditure to be effectively prioritized both \nwithin a subsector (such as roads and bridges), and within the sector, given financing for Assam \nState Transport Corporation to meet its operating deficits and failure to provide capital outlay for \ninland water transport. \n \n19.  Irrigation  and  Water  Supply.  The  irrigation  sector  illustrates  rising  departmental \nexpenditures on salaries and wages with resulting cutbacks on operation and maintenance, and \nan absence of due consideration for the effects on rural and agricultural growth. Thus, the \nrevenue expenditure trend in the irrigation sector for the past 13 years from FY1991 to FY2003 \nshows a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11%, albeit with significant fluctuations from \nFY2000 to FY2003.8 The expenditure on salaries and wages also implies that operation and \nmaintenance  expenditures  were  correspondingly  severely  constrained  by  the  Irrigation \nDepartment.  Instead  of  careful  consideration  of,  for  example,  Tenth  Finance  Commission \nnorms, under which operation and maintenance expenditure of Rs0.23 billion would be required, \nonly about Rs0.03 billion was actually made available. The resultant impact of such inadequate \ndepartmental expenditure criteria and management has been the poor creation of irrigation \npotential in Assam as compared with the national average.9   \n \nE.  Core Governance \n \n20.  Core Governance Reform Path. The diagnostic assessment of public administration \nand public sector enterprises in Assam shows that certain priority core governance measures \nare  needed  to  underpin  fiscal  stabilization  in  the  first  subprogram  and  set  the  necessary \nfoundation  for  fiscal  consolidation  in  the  second  subprogram.  These  measures  include \ndevelopment of reliable employee data for containment of the overall size of the government, \nfunctional reviews for key expenditure departments, and containment of public expenditure \nleakage  and  corruption  through  expenditure  tracking  surveys  and  review  of  anticorruption \n                                                           \n8  In FY2000 revenue expenditure was Rs0.36 billion and rose to Rs0.8 billion in FY2001 before declining to around \nRs0.55 billion in FY2002 and FY2003. The main component of irrigation sector revenue expenditure is salaries and \nwages (over 95%) and the fluctuations therefore reflect the arrears because of the recommendations of the Fifth \nPay Commission as well as transfers of employees from completed schemes. \n9  In India as a whole, the irrigation potential created is approximately 68% of the total assessed irrigation potential; in \nAssam, this is less than 11%.  ", "  Appendix 1  37  \nmechanisms and procedures. Such measures enable deeper public administration restructuring \nunder the second subprogram. Demonstrable achievement of closure of identified PSEs and \nrelated  financial  governance  and  social  safety  net  programs  fostering  private  sector \nopportunities enable a PSE restructuring and private sector policy implementation thrust under \nthe second subprogram.  \n \n21.  Public  Administration.  Like  other  states  in  the  northeast,  absence  of  alternative \nemployment avenues has led to the development of the role of ASG as a primary provider of \nemployment. The resulting government overemployment,10 coupled with comparatively high \nwages has eroded the ability of the state to invest in infrastructure and critically undermined the \nability of ASG to ensure adequate, well-targeted, and quality public goods and services related \nto poverty reduction. \n \n22.  Weaknesses of the underlying employee data collection and recording in Assam have \nimpeded  the  systematic  identification  of  nonessential  posts  at  different  levels  of  various \ndepartments  so  that  excess  human  resources  can  be  reduced  proportionately  in  time. \nConsequently,  efforts  since  1999,  first  by  the  State-Level  Empowered  Committee  and \nsubsequently by the Assam Administrative Reforms Commission to identify such posts have not \nsucceeded.  \n \n23.  A  diagnostic  study  of  ASG\u2019s  Education  Department,11  which  provides  examples  of \nconcern on quality of public expenditure and performance orientation, illustrates the need for \nfunctional reviewing. Whereas, elementary education has an overall pupil-teacher ratio of 40:1 \nthe  nonobjective  placement  of  teachers  results  in  substantial  interdistrict  disparities.  For \nexample, Dhubri district has a pupil-teacher ratio of 58:1 and Goalpara district 48:1. Although \nthe number of high schools has increased ten-fold from FY1951 to FY1998 and enrolment of \nhigh and higher secondary schools increased two-fold from FY1981 to FY1998, during this \nsame period, the dropout rate increased faster than the national average. Furthermore, from \n1997 to 2000, only 32.6% of students passed the state\u2019s high school leaving examination. \n \n24.  In addition to the size and qualitative performance of the government bureaucracy in \nAssam, there are also indications of vulnerability to leakage of public expenditures under its \ntrust.  Again,  taking  the  example  of  the  Education  Department,  a  limited  high-level  public \nexpenditure  tracking  survey  was  conducted  on  an  ongoing  scheme  called  Operation \nBlackboard.  The  scheme  was  undertaken  to  help  provide  teaching-learning  equipment  for \nprimary schools. Material supply under Operation Blackboard was tracked from the directorate \nto the district, from the district to blocks, and from the blocks to schools. Allowing for significant \ndata constraints, in many cases the quality of materials like desk benches were poor and \nbroken, and record keeping at block and school level was poor, so that they had no clarity on \nthe number and time of receipt of material.  \n \n25.  Public Sector Enterprises. The 47 PSEs in the PSE sector are involved in a broad \nrange of sectors in the state economy: inland and water transport (excluding ASEB), housing, \nfinance,  textiles,  water  and  sewerage,  petrochemicals,  gas  transportation,  construction, \nwarehousing and logistics, retail, agricultural production and processing, tourism, electronics, \n                                                           \n10  Overemployment  is  evidenced  both  by  number  of  government  employees  to  population  (20.51  per  1,000 \npopulation) and as a percentage of GSDP (7.76%), which is higher than other states (Andhra Pradesh 5.25%, \nKarnataka 4.99%, West Bengal 6.10%) according to FY2001 data. Within such overemployment, the numbers in \ngrades III and IV are skewed. As an example, the Elementary Education Directorate has 37 grade I employees, \n234 grade II employees, 123,969 grade III employees, and 7,993 grade IV employees. \n11 The Education Department had 208,827 employees (1998 data) and is one of the largest ASG departments. ", "38   Appendix 1 \ntea  plantation,  manufacturing  and  contract  assembly,  welfare  support  to  minority  and \ndisadvantaged sections of society, state promotional activity, industrial development parks, and \npaper and paper-derived industry. The PSEs differ in business purpose; some are welfare \ndriven or act as tools for implementing ASG policy and are not businesses as such. \n \n26.  The financial condition of the PSE sector is not sound. Of the 47 PSEs, only around 6 \nare profitable; most have large negative equity positions. State investment has taken the form of \ndirect equity, loans, and grants/subsidies, and indirect support when standing as guarantor to \nPSE loans from financial institutions. Data collection to assess the condition of the PSE sector \nhas been particularly difficult, as the average years in arrears in PSE submission of audited \nfinancial statements is about 8 years. Based on the latest provisional statements from 25 PSEs, \nrepresenting  around  87%  of  state  investment  in  the  sector  excluding  ASEB  (as  per  DPE \nrecords), the total state investment in the sector is estimated at Rs14.07 billion. The annual \nASG contribution to the PSEs is estimated to be around Rs0.44 billion per year. Based on the \nprovisional accounts of the 25 PSEs, the annual losses of the total PSE sector are estimated to \nbe around Rs1 billion\u20131.2 billion per annum. As a result of the losses exceeding the annual \ncontribution, the value of state investment in the PSEs has been eroding continuously.  \n \n27.  ASG has reached a critical stage in its investment in this sector. With such a position of \nnegative equity, PSEs have no capacity to meet their outstanding and growing liabilities. These \nliabilities are mainly in the form of employee entitlements, statutory dues, and overdue financial \nloans (principal and interest). In respect to these outstanding liabilities, ASG has an explicit \ncontingent liability where it has guaranteed specific PSE loans. In respect to the balance, ASG, \nas shareholder, knew of the poor state of the financial affairs in the particular PSEs when these \nliabilities were incurred.  \n \n28.  With likely annual losses of Rs1 billion\u20131.2 billion per annum, and banks and financial \ninstitutions unlikely to provide additional loans given the poor repayment track record of the \nPSEs, ASG will need to provide more explicit funding to these PSEs. The clear trend is for \nPSEs to be an increasing and significant burden on state finances. The one positive systemic \nfactor for ASG in the PSE portfolio is the value tied up in land and buildings in the PSEs. While \nthe land and buildings could represent significant value, no comprehensive assessment has \nbeen made of this value in the sector.  \n \nF.  ASG Reform Achievements \n \n29.  Resource Mobilization. Since FY2000, revenue collections from own taxes in the state \nhave improved significantly. This is mainly due to the concerted efforts in improving both the \nstructure and operation of the sales tax system, including efforts to clear the arrears. Adopting a \nvalue-added tax has been actively on the agenda from April 2003 and preparation to introduce \nthe tax is to be intensified. \n \n30.  Debt Management. ASG opted for the debt swap scheme announced by the central \nGovernment.  In  addition,  ASG  has  negotiated  debt  settlements  with  financial  institutions, \nincluding  Industrial  Financial  Corporation  of  India  and  Industrial  Credit  and  Investment \nCorporation of India Limited in FY2003. It is expected to negotiate similar settlements with the \nIndustrial Development Bank of India, the Housing and Urban Development Corporation, and \nother banks during FY2005. The state has been successful in negotiating favorable one-time \nsettlements with financial institutions as it involved the payment of only 75% of the principal \noutstanding and the full waiver of interest and other penalties. In its negotiations with the banks, \nthe settlement has been successful though less favorable than those with financial institutions. \nThe settlement with the banks involved the payment of 100% principal and only a minor part of ", "  Appendix 1  39  \nthe interest payable. Additionally, ASG has successfully rescheduled loans overdue of Rs2.3 \nbillion  to  the  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Corporation,  which  involved  waivers  of \ncompound and penal interest totaling Rs1.45 billion. \n \n31.  Public Administration. The developments that reflect the political and bureaucratic \ncommitment  for  reforming  public  administration  are  (i)  the  three  interim  reports  of  Assam \nAdministrative Reforms Commission in 2003 and 2004, and the stage of action taken by ASG \nfor their implementation; (ii) the decision to reduce the size of the Council of Ministers from 35 to \n19 consequent to the 91st Constitutional amendment; (iii) based on the recommendation of the \nAssam Administrative Reforms Commission, the in-principle decision to reduce the number of \ndepartments from 54 to 25; (iv) measures for devolution of functions and transfer of schemes to \nelected  local  bodies  in  pursuance  of  the  73rd  and  74th  Constitutional  amendments;  (v) \nestablishment  of  the  High-Powered  Committee  under  the  chief  secretary  to  consider  and \nrecommend action to ASG on the recommendations of the Assam Administrative Reforms \nCommission; and (vi) the ongoing efforts of ASG to restructure the civil service and contain \nsalary costs subsequent to undertakings under the memorandum of understanding with the \nGovernment  of  India  in  2003,  which  are  being  overseen  by  the  State-Level  Empowered \nCommittee. \n \n32.  Information  Technology  Initiatives.  AMTRON  (one  of  the  PSEs  in  Assam)  has \ndeveloped the Assam Wide Area Network program, under which a fiber-optic backbone is being \nprogressively run to all state district commissioners\u2019 offices. Two districts (Nagaon and Tezpur) \nare already connected, with Silchar and Bongaigaon to follow in August 2004, and Jorhat in \nOctober 2004. With the objective of integrated financial management, a centralized treasury \nmanagement information system is being executed by ASG. The Treasury system is now being \npiloted in the Dispur Treasury. It will shortly be extended to the Kamrup and New Guwahati \ntreasuries, and to the Finance (Budget Department) for budget formulation. Seventy-seven of \nthe Tax offices are computerized and interlinked throughout the state. The composite checkpost \nat Srirampur is also computerized and linked with the tax offices.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     priority in country poverty partnership   \n    No  agreement?    No \n \n(There is no country poverty partnership \nagreement.  However,  the  India  Country \nStrategy and Program (CSP), 2003\u20132006 \nand  the  India  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram  Update  (CSPU)  2005\u20132007 \nreports on the need to shift toward poorer \nstates like Assam as one of the important \nstrategies  for  mainstreaming  poverty \nreduction in the India program.)  \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \nWith 36.09% of its population below the poverty line, Assam has very high levels of income and human poverty, and a \nper capita income that was 35% lower than the all-India average in 2001\u20132002. Fifty percent of the population suffers \nfrom chronic and seasonal hunger.  \n \nThe Assam Governance and Public Resource Management Program will contribute to promoting fiscal stabilization \nand consolidation and improved governance. State finance reforms for fiscal stabilization will support additional fiscal \nresources that can be used for poverty-focused social sector expenditure and some user fee reforms enabling better \ntargeting of the poor as well as enhanced infrastructure spending, fostering economic growth and contributing to \npoverty reduction. The fiscal governance reform promoting a sharpened level of attention to growth-oriented capital \nexpenditure, including the core investment program, and enabling pro-poor budgeting will also help in strengthening \npoverty  reduction  efforts.  Finally,  core  governance  reforms  that  stem  unproductive  subsidies  on  public  sector \nenterprises (PSEs), for example, will free up resources for targeted subsidies to the poor. Core governance reforms \naimed at improving the quality of public administration expenditure and stopping corruption related to fiscal leakages \nwill also assist expenditures reaching the poor. In addition, core governance promotion of alternative avenues of \ngrowth and employment through the private sector will help to address poverty. Since development is intricately \nrelated to quality of governance as indicated in the recent Human Development Report for Assam (2003) and poor \nmanagement of public institutions for service delivery has been identified as a major cause of poverty as indicated by \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) supported participatory poverty assessments in the state, the Program will contribute \nto poverty reduction. \n \n \nB.

The likely poverty and social impacts \nof the Program have been identified and indicated in the supplementary appendix table on Matrix of Poverty Impact \nand Mitigation Assessment (Supplementary Appendix H). Poverty monitoring and poverty impact assessment will \nensure that appropriate mitigation measures are introduced where necessary and the Program contributes to poverty \nreduction as intended. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes    No  \nExtensive consultations were held with the Assam state government (ASG), civil society organizations, and the private \nsector and poor people were also consulted during ADB-supported participatory poverty assessments carried out in \nthe state.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes           No \nThe consultations were intended for feedback on the priorities for poverty reduction and policy reform.
