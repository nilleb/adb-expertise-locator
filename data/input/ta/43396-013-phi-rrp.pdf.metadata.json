I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program, and \n(ii) a proposed policy-based loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the \nIncreasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program.1  \n \n2.  The program will support the government\u2019s key reform priorities aimed at employment \ngeneration by increasing competitiveness in the economy using an inclusive approach through \nthe labor market. The structural reform priorities include efforts to enhance the business climate \nby promoting competition policy, regulatory efficiency, competitive logistics, and private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure through public\u2013private partnership (PPP) projects. The program \nalso supports the government\u2019s efforts to promote competitive labor markets through piloting a \njob placement program to assist young school leavers find decent jobs (MyFirstJob), piloting an \nindustry-led skills and services development program, and labor policy reforms. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The government has made decent employment creation one of its central tenets. \nThe Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2011\u20132016 aims to create 1 million new jobs per year \nand maintain the unemployment rate within a narrow range of 6.8%\u20137.2%.2 Improvements in \nthe business climate and infrastructure to attract investment and create jobs, and programs to \nimprove the skills of young people and address the mismatch of skills in the labor market, form \ncentral themes of the economic program. \n \n4.  Low investment rate. There was significant growth in private and public investment in \nthe 1990s. The investment rate started to decline after the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and \nbottomed out at 13.0% in 2005. It had recovered to 15.0% of gross domestic product by 2010 \n(1988 prices), but is still lower than in most other Southeast Asian economies. A consequence \nof  this  lower  investment  rate  has  been  lower  long-term  economic  growth  potential.  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff estimates suggest that the Philippines is under-investing by as \nmuch as 5 percentage points of gross domestic product if it is to raise its potential growth to \n6.0% from the current level of 5.0%. \n \n5.  Weak competitiveness. While there has been a marked improvement in the rankings of \nthe Philippines in key global competitiveness surveys, indicating improved perceptions about \nthe investment climate, the country continues to rate low on an international comparison of \ncompetitiveness indicators.3 Several ADB and other diagnostic studies found that high business \ncompliance costs in the regulatory environment, the prevalence of anticompetitive regulation \nand practices in several key services sectors, and high costs in trade logistics affected the \ncompetitiveness of the Philippines economy. Inefficiencies in tax policy and tax administration \nhurt exporters of goods and services. The Philippines is under-investing in infrastructure due to \nlimited national budget resources and a weak regulatory framework for infrastructure projects \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Unemployment rate is 7.2% in January 2012. \n3  The 2012 Global Competitiveness Index ranks the Philippines 75th out of 142 countries, up 10 places from 2011. \nThe 2012 Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom ranks the Philippines 107th out of 179 countries, up \neight places over the previous year. The 2012 World Bank Group Doing Business Index ranks the Philippines \n136th out of 183 countries, down two places from the 2011 report.  ", "2   \nunder the 1990 Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer (BOT) Law. Inadequate skills of workers in key sectors \nand structural rigidities in the labor market have also affected competitiveness of the economy.4 \n \n6.  Labor market and employment generation. While higher and sustainable economic \ngrowth is necessary to create more jobs, it is not sufficient as there are structural and policy \nimpediments to employment generation. The 2012 ADB study on youth labor market experience \nfound that high school leavers and dropouts have a difficult time integrating into the labor \nmarket. 5 It can take them up to 4 years to find a wage job compared with 2 years for college \ngraduates, and only 50% of high school leavers actually find wage employment indicating a \nsizeable proportion of young persons excluded from productive employment. Several factors \ncontribute to this slower transition to the workplace for high school leavers. First, economic \ngrowth averaging 5.0% per annum has been insufficient to create enough wage jobs for the 1 \nmillion new labor market entrants each year (economic growth above 6.0% is needed). Second, \nthe labor market has been undergoing a structural change with an increased demand for skilled \nworkers. This change has resulted in a widening skills mismatch in the labor market as many \nhigh school leavers are ill-equipped for entry into the labor market. Third, public provisioning of \nemployment services to connect job seekers with jobs is in the early stages of development and \nnot well targeted. There is limited labor market information available to school leavers. Fourth, \nsome labor regulations have dampened employment growth.  \n \n7.  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132016.  The  government  recognizes  these \nconstraints on the investment climate and on employment generation. The PDP, 2011\u20132016 \nhas improving the competitiveness of industry and services as a core component, and its \nagenda  includes  creating  a  better  business  environment  and  promoting  PPP  projects  in \ninfrastructure. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 is consistent and aligned with the \nPDP.6 It  has  set  expansion  in  investment  as  an  outcome  indicator.  ADB  has  extensive \nexperience  in  assisting  with  improving  the  investment  climate  in  the  Philippines,  including \nassistance  to  the  energy  sector,  capital  market  development,  road  infrastructure,  and  the \nbusiness climate.7 Lessons learned from these programs include: (i) policy reforms are more \nlikely  to  show  impact  if  they  are  performance-based  measures;  (ii)  interventions  are  also \nrequired to operationalize policy reforms at the ground level; and (iii) programs should embed \nevaluation  and  monitoring  frameworks  to  assist  governments  with  evidenced-based  policy \ndevelopment.  \n \n8.  In response to private sector demands for structural reforms to specific sectors that hold \npromise for further lifting economic growth, the government has also prioritized support for \nseveral  sectors  in  the  PDP,  2011\u20132016.8 The  tourism  sector  has  been  identified  by  the \ngovernment  and  private  sector  for  longer-term  development  based  on  its  recent  growth \nperformance, job creation possibilities across the archipelago, and positive externalities to other \nsectors. The challenges facing the tourism sector are also reflective of the challenges facing the \n                                                \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management - Investment Climate (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Youth School-to-Work Transition (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nappendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2011.

Philippines Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Increasing Strategic Focus for Better Results. \nManila.  \n8  Joint Foreign Chambers. 2010. Arangkada Philippines 2010. Manila, identifies tourism, business processing \noutsourcing, creative industries, infrastructure, manufacturing and logistics, agribusiness, and mining as seven big \nsectors with promising growth prospects. International Monetary Fund. 2007. Philippines Selected Issues. Country \nReport No. 07/131. Washington, DC, also noted the services sector holds promise for lifting growth in the \nPhilippines. ", "    3  \neconomy as a whole: the 2011 World Economic Forum Tourism and Travel Competitiveness \nIndex ranks the Philippines 94th out of 139 countries. To address this, and with support under \nthe program, the government has put together a package of structural reforms to promote a \nconducive  business  environment  in  the  sector,  PPP  infrastructure  investments  to  improve \nconnectivity between different destinations, and interventions to improve service standards and \nindustry skills. It is in this context that the government and the private sector believe that \nsuccessful implementation of these structural reforms in the tourism sector could provide a \npotential demonstration model for reforms in other sectors of the economy. The logistics sector \nhas also been identified by government and the private sector for development based on its \neconomy-wide  linkages.  The  logistics  sector  remains  high  cost  for  air,  sea,  and  road \ntransportation  affecting  competitiveness  of  industry  and  services  sector.  The  government \nintends to address this through reforms to the aviation sector (\u201copen skies\u201d policy and tax \nreform), improvements in port management and customs procedures.  \n \n9.  The program builds on and complements other ADB programs promoting governance \nreforms  in  the  Philippines,  such  as  the  Governance  and  Justice  Sector  Reform  Program, \ncompleted  in  December  2011.9 Also,  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) is assisting implementing agencies under the program to enhance internal \ncontrol  and  audit  systems.10   Previous  ADB  programs supporting  technical  and  vocational \neducation in the Philippines have laid down the infrastructure for the tourism industry skills \nintervention under the program (para. 11).11 \n \n10.  The Programmatic Approach. The program comprises of two subprograms enveloped \nby a medium-term results-based framework. The program has identified three outputs critical for \nraising competitiveness and promoting labor market inclusiveness: (i) structural policy reforms \nto  promote  competitiveness  through  a  better  competition  policy,  regulatory  efficiency,  and \ncompetitive  trade  logistics;  (ii)  creating  an  efficient  market  for  infrastructure  through  PPP \nprojects; and (iii) promoting competitive labor markets to address structural weaknesses and \ngenerate employment. The program includes a set of high-impact structural policy reforms (such \nas competition policy, regulatory reform, tax, and trade logistics) designed to potentially benefit \nall sectors. It also adopts a package of deeper structural policy reforms and assistance to \nspecific leading sectors, starting with the tourism sector and logistics in subprogram 1. Other \nsectors on a case by case basis may be considered for structural reforms in subprogram 2.12 \n \n11.  The  program  includes  three  innovative  interventions  that  apply  policy  and  make  it \noperational  on  the  ground  with  clearly  defined  and  measurable  performance  indicators. \nSubprogram 2 loan disbursement will be based on progress with these performance indicators. \nThe  proposed  youth job  placement  program, referred  to  as  MyFirstJob,  will  be  a  flagship \nprogram of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Drawing on successful models in \nLatin America, Canada, and Europe, MyFirstJob will provide job placement assistance to high \nschool leavers to help them better integrate into the labor market. Services that will be provided \ninclude career counseling and grants for vocational training linked to internships with public and \nprivate sector employers. The MyFirstJob pilot will be implemented through public employment \nservice offices (PESOs) in three localities in subprogram 2 and aims to target 1,600 school \nleavers, of which 50% will be women. Another innovative intervention is the establishment of the \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Manila \n12 Diagram: Structure of ICIG Program (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4   \nPPP of the Department of Tourism (DOT) in service standards and skills development in the \ntourism  sector.  The  skills  development  program  will  include  industry-led  upgrading  of \ncurriculums, and a matching grants program for industry to fund training of workers in the \ntourism sector. The pilot will be initiated in subprogram 2 and will target approximately 5,000 \ntourism workers. The industry skills program will also be complemented by the new hotel quality \nassurance and accreditation system aimed at raising services standards in the sector. The \naccreditation system includes new hotel standards aligned with international benchmarks. A \nthird-party international assessor will be engaged to assist with the pilot to ensure credibility in \nthe new hotel rating system. Both the skills development and hotel accreditation interventions \nwill be piloted in a few selected tourism destinations to  produce successful demonstration \nmodels that can be rolled out nationally. The final intervention is the establishment of the \nregulatory impact assessment (RIA) program in key departments to improve the quality of \nregulations. The RIA promotes transparent, evidence-based policy development in government. \nIt is intended that the programs will be rolled out nationally after completion of the pilots. ADB is \npreparing separate TA to support the DOLE and DOT to design, implement, and fund the \npilots.13  \n \n12.  Third, the program will have built-in monitoring and evaluation frameworks to assist the \ngovernment with evidenced-based policy making aimed at building stronger political support for \neventual national rollout of the pilot programs. The evaluations could also guide government \nand development partners in adopting these models for other sectors. The monitoring and \nevaluation frameworks will be funded under the separate TA (footnote 13). Baseline data will be \ncollected for each pilot and performance of participants in the pilots (treatment groups) and \ncomparable nonparticipants (control groups) will be tracked over a 2\u20133\u2013year period to enable a \nrigorous impact evaluation of the results of the pilots.  \n \n13.  The program has been jointly formulated by the Government of the Philippines, ADB, \nand the Government of Japan. The Government of Japan (through the Japan International \nCooperation Agency, JICA) is cofinancing components 1 and 2 of the policy-based loan for \nsubprograms 1 and 2. The JICA will cofinance subprogram 1 in the amount of $100 million \nequivalent.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines  (through  the  Department  of  Finance)  has \ncoordinated  the  reform  agenda  with  other  development  partners  through  established \ncoordination mechanisms such as the National Competitiveness Council.14 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact of the program is an improved investment climate. The benchmark will be \nimprovements in key global competitiveness indicators. The growth inclusiveness element of an \nimproved investment climate is measured by the expansion in the number of young people \nemployed  in  full-time  wage  jobs.  Wage  employment  provides  higher  economic  returns  to \nschooling than informal employment, and evidence points to wage employment helping families \nescape from poverty (footnote 5). The outcome of the program will be improved competitiveness \nof selected sectors.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Subprogram  1  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  improving  competitiveness  and \ninclusiveness in three outputs: (i) structural policy reforms to the economy, (ii) creating an \n                                                \n13 Two proposed TA projects are being processed to provide assistance to DOT and DOLE to pilot the programs in \nsubprogram  2.  The  Government  of  Canada  (through  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency)  is \nconsidering financing the two proposed TA projects with a grant of $12,500,000. \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    5  \nefficient market for infrastructure projects through PPP projects, and (iii) promoting competitive \nlabor markets. All 25 policy measures required for subprogram 1 have been fully accomplished. \n \n1.  Output 1: Structural Policy Reforms to Promote Competitiveness \n \n16.  Subprogram 1 supports the government in initiating a competition policy and measures \nto promote competitive trade logistics. \n \n17.  Competition policy and regulatory efficiency. The government has initiated steps to \ndevelop a robust competition policy framework. Its approach adopts three pillars: (i) develop a \ncompetition policy law, (ii) institutionalize RIAs in government, and (iii) undertake sector-by-\nsector competition and regulatory reforms. It is recognized that this is a long-term agenda. \nUnder subprogram 1, the following measures were accomplished to start the development of a \ncompetition policy. First, in June 2011, a presidential executive order was issued mandating the \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) to lead the implementation of a competition law as a precursor to \nCongress passing a competition law. A departmental order was issued establishing the Office \nfor Competition at the DOJ, and the office was provided with a startup budget in 2012. Under \nsubprogram 2, capacity development activities at the office will be carried out and the office \nmade operational. Second, the government started implementing RIA through accomplishing \nthe following critical institutional steps: (i) a memorandum of agreement between DOT and \nDOLE  to  pilot  RIAs  in  the  departments;  (ii)  DOT  and  DOLE  designated  focal  persons \nresponsible for overseeing RIA implementation in the respective agencies; and (iii) 2012 work \nplans drafted by DOLE and DOT identifying regulations to be subject to RIA. The DOLE will \nsubject the review of the Labor Code to the RIA process and DOT will use RIA to assess the \nimpact on the business community of proposed implementing regulations and standards under \nthe 2009 Law on Tourism. Under subprogram 2, RIA will be extended to 2\u20133 other agencies and \na legal framework for establishing an office of better regulatory practice will be drafted. Ongoing \nADB TA is providing capacity building support for the RIA program.15 \n \n18.  Promoting competitive trade logistics. A major reform to the logistics market is the \ngovernment\u2019s  \u201copen  skies\u201d  reforms.  Presidential  Executive  Order  29  was  issued  in  2011 \nproviding for open skies in the domestic aviation sector, whereby the Philippine Air Panels \n(which negotiates agreements on landing rights) may offer and promote freedom rights to the \ncountry\u2019s airports other than Ninoy Aquino International Airport without restriction on frequency, \ncapacity,  and  type  of  aircraft.  Tax  distortions  have  also  prevented  a  conducive  business \nenvironment  between  domestic  and  foreign  carriers  in  the  domestic  aviation  and  shipping \nmarkets. In subprogram 2, with ADB TA, the government will draft amendments to the tax code \nabolishing the common carrier tax applied to gross cargo and passenger revenue of foreign-\nowned carriers. Both these reforms will align the Philippines aviation sector with neighboring \neconomies and will boost the competitiveness of the logistics sector benefiting a wide range of \nindustries including tourism. \n \n19.  Another major reform benefiting exporters of goods and services is the reform to VAT \nrefunds for enterprises. Until 2011, enterprises received tax credit certificates (TCCs) for VAT \nrefunds, instead of cash refunds commonly used elsewhere in the region. The TCC approach \ntied up the working capital of firms and, therefore, significantly raised their cost of working \ncapital. With analytical support funded by JICA, the government has abolished the TCC system \nand  will  make  cash  refunds,  starting  with  new  VAT  refunds  in  2012.  The  2012  General \nAppropriations  Act  (national  budget)  allocated  P9.3  billion  for  VAT  cash  refunds  in  2012. \nEncashment of the stock of TCCs will occur during subprogram 2. As a result of this reform, \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2011. Philippines: Strengthening Institutions for an Improved Investment Climate. Manila. \n ", "6   \nADB staff estimate that exporters could save up to $150 million on the cost of working capital \nover  the  program  medium-term  period  of  2011\u20132016.  Other  accomplishments  aimed  at \nimproving trade logistics include (i) the Bureau of Customs including in its 5-year strategic plan \nmeasures  for  improving  customs  clearance  and  for  aligning  customs  procedures  with \ninternational standards under the ratified Revised Kyoto Convention on the simplification and \nharmonization of customs procedures; and (ii) the government, through the Department of \nTransportation and Communications and port authorities, agreeing to improve container traffic \nand  revenue  performance  at  the  Manila,  Subic,  and  Batangas  ports  in  an  effort  to  ease \ncontainer congestion at the Manila port. The government is drafting a ports utilization plan \ncontaining  concrete  measures  to  decongest  the  Manila  port.  These  measures  will  be \nimplemented in subprogram 2. \n \n2.  Output 2: Creating an Efficient Market for Infrastructure Projects through \nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships \n \n20.  Subprogram 1 supports the government in creating a world class PPP for infrastructure \nas one financing modality for addressing the underinvestment in infrastructure.16  \n \n21.  Strengthening the public\u2013private partnership policy, regulatory, and institutional \nframework. In 2010, the government announced the promotion of PPPs in infrastructure as a \ncentral priority of its economic agenda. As a first step, in September 2010, the government \nrestructured the build\u2013own\u2013transfer center into the Public\u2013Private Partnership Center (PPPC), \nan agency attached to the NEDA. Building on this reform in subprogram 1 and with ADB\u2019s TA \non PPP in infrastructure, the government implemented a series of measures to strengthen the \nPPP governance framework and build capacity of the PPPC with the aim of improving service \ndelivery.17 These accomplishments included (i) The NEDA drafted amendments to Presidential \nExecutive Order 8 (2010) to streamline functions of the PPPC and strengthen the operations of \nthe  Project  Development  and  Monitoring  Facility,  which  helps  prepare  PPP  projects.  The \npresidential executive order will be issued during subprogram 2.  (ii) The government drafted \nand circulated amendments to the implementing rules and regulations of the BOT Law to \naddress regulatory impediments to PPPs in infrastructure, and drafted amendments to the joint-\nventure guidelines to ensure consistency with the PPP regulatory framework. These legislative \nand regulatory measures will be completed in subprogram 2.  (iii) To advance the preparation of \nPPP projects prepared by the PPPC, the PPPC established a panel of firms for fast-track \nselection  of  PPP  project  development  consultants.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  Project \nDevelopment and Monitoring Facility will provide support for carrying out six feasibility studies \nfor PPP projects. Recently, much progress has been made in bringing PPP projects to the \ncompetitive bidding stage. Through the PDMF, nine projects are being prepared for competitive \nbidding in 2012, of which three PPP projects are new international and domestic airports in \nsupport of tourism infrastructure.18  \n \n22.  The  government  introduced  measures  to  provide  for  sustainable  financing  of \npublic\u2013private partnership projects. Under subprogram 1, the government carried out the \nfollowing measures to provide budgetary support to the PPPC and develop instruments for \nsustainable financing of PPPs: (i) The 2012 national budget allocated total funding of P19.6 \nbillion  to  the  Strategic  Support  Fund  (SSF)  and  P161.0  million  to  the  PDMF  to  finance \npreparation of PPP projects and public capital expenditure. The NEDA board\u2019s Investment \nCoordination Committee\u2019s guidelines for the use of the SSF were issued.  (ii) The Department of \n                                                \n16 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Infrastructure (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2011.

", "    7  \nFinance  (DOF)  initiated  a  study  on  identification  of  risks,  management,  and  funding  of \ncontingent liabilities arising from PPP projects and initiated a study on the mechanisms of \ngovernment financing of its share in PPP projects. Under subprogram 2, the government will \nformulate a policy on financing and contingent liabilities. \n \n3.  Output 3: Promoting Competitive Labor Markets  \n23.  Subprogram 1 supports the government in implementing measures and programs to \nimprove youth job placements, improve skills development in the workplace, and address other \nstructural rigidities in the labor market with the aim of stimulating job growth. \n \n24.  MyFirstJob pilot. The government is addressing the slow school-to-work transition for \nyoung persons with its proposed MyFirstJob pilot. To initiate the pilot, the government undertook \nseveral institutional and capacity development measures: (i) DOLE has been advocating among \nlocal government units to institutionalize PESOs as permanent, staffed, and funded agencies of \nlocal government units. As of December 2011, 89 PESOs had been institutionalized, placing \napproximately  95,000  people  into  jobs.  With  the  assistance  of  the  International  Labor \nOrganization,  DOLE  has  provided  capacity  building  support  to  the  PESOs  in  employment \nfacilitation, including staff training in coaching and counseling.  (ii) DOLE drafted labor market \ninformation materials for dissemination among the public and high schools with the aim of \nimproving  awareness  among  young  people  about  career  opportunities.  Subprogram  2  will \nextend  these  efforts  through  further  capacity  building  measures  at  the  PESOs  and \nimplementation of the MyFirstJob pilot. Under ADB TA, work on the design of the MyFirstJob \npilot is ongoing (footnote 15). \n \n25.  Private\u2013public partnership in tourism industry skills and service development. \nEmployers in several sectors complain about the skills mismatch of many school leavers and \nthe emerging shortages of skilled workers. The government recognizes these constraints on \ncompetitiveness  and  employment  and  is  trying  to  address  them  through  both  crosscutting \ninterventions and sector-specific programs. Under subprogram 1, the following measures have \nbeen instituted to set out the foundations for skills development, starting with the tourism sector: \nThe DOT endorsed the National Tourism Development Plan, 2011\u20132016. Key features of the \nplan  relevant  to  the  program  include  (i)  recommended  adoption  of  a  PPP  framework  for \naccreditation and certification of tourism service providers, and (ii) a PPP in tourism industry \nskills development. Ongoing ADB TA is supporting the DOT to design and develop the PPP in \nindustry skills development and a matching grants fund. The skills development program and \nfund will be made operational in subprogram 2; to improve service standards, the government \n(through the DOT) drafted new standards for hotels and resorts consistent with international \nstandards. Piloting of the new standards will be carried out in subprogram 2.  \n \n26.  Employment  policies  and  programs. The government,  in  collaboration  with  other \nstakeholders, initiated actions to improve labor and employment policies and programs with the \naim  of  generating  employment  and  improving  access  to  decent  employment.  These \naccomplishments included the following: (i) DOLE initiated a comprehensive review of the labor \ncode  with  the  aim  of  improving  quality  employment  facilitation  and  addressing  structural \nimpediments in the labor market. The review will be carried out by DOLE staff under the RIA \ninitiative  with  TA  from  ADB  (footnote  15).  A  tripartite  committee  comprising  government, \nemployers, and union groups will oversee the review. Key recommendations for reforming \naspects of the Labor Code are expected in late-2012.  (ii) DOLE completed a series of studies \nto identify policies to mitigate labor market risks, such as unemployment insurance and risks \nfrom  climate  change  and  natural  disasters.    (iii)  In  2010,  the  government  established  the \n ", "8   \nCommunity-Based  Employment  Program,  which  is  the  umbrella  for  the  different  public \nemployment programs in several departments.  This program will be evaluated in subprogram 2. \n \n27.  Triggers for subprogram 2 and medium-term results framework. The program has \nspecified (i) 15 policy triggers that need to be satisfactorily accomplished by early 2014, and  \n(ii)  a  set  of  medium-term  expected  results.  The  triggers  advance  accomplishments  under \nsubprogram 1 with the primary focus on employment facilitation systems, skills development, \npromoting competition policy, tax reform, lowering costs of trade logistics, and advancing the \npreparation of PPP projects (Appendix 4). \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n28.  To support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a single tranche loan of \n$350,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1  of  the \nprogram. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan \nproceeds will be used to finance the full exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of \nitems produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,19 the \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as the \nborrower. \n \n29.  The subprogram 1 loan proceeds will support key development spending in the 2012 \nbudget, including (i) budget allocation of P9.3 billion to fund the VAT cash refund policy trigger \nunder subprogram 1; (ii) budget allocation of P22.1 billion to fund the SSF and P161.0 million to \nthe PDMF to finance the public sector share of capital spending and project preparation costs \nfor PPP projects; and (iii) other spending items in the 2012 budget such as for the start up of the \nOffice of Competition at the DOJ, capacity development of the PESOs, and the review of the \nLabor Code, among other things. The indicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $350,000,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. It will support key development spending in the 2013 and \n2014 budgets (policy triggers) including VAT cash refunds, SSF, PDMF, competition office, and \nindustry skills development fund. The loan will also offset the reduction in tax revenues of \napproximately $80 million per annum resulting from the abolition of the 3.0% common carrier tax \non foreign carriers. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  Subprogram 1 period is from August 2010 to October 2012 and the subprogram 2 period \nis from April 2012 to October 2014. The DOF will be the executing agency for the program and \nwill be responsible for the overall implementation of subprogram 1 and the medium-term results \nframework. The program implementing agencies \u2014 DOJ, DOLE, DOT, the Department of Trade \nand Industry, the Department of Transportation and Communications, NEDA, the Bureau of \nCustoms,  and  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  \u2014  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation of subprogram 1. The DOF will coordinate with implementing agencies and \n                                                \n19 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. ", "    9  \nmeet  with  them  as  required  to  monitor  progress  on  subprogram  1  reforms.  The  National \nCompetitiveness Council will consult with representatives of the key chambers of commerce \u2014\nsuch as the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industries and the Joint Foreign Chambers \nof Commerce \u2014 to provide feedback to the DOF and implementing agencies on program \nimplementation, impact, and other issues affecting competitiveness. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n31.  The size of the program loan is based on (i) the relative importance of the sector to the \neconomy and the weight of the benefits of the reform program, (ii) the policy adjustment costs \nincurred by the government and stakeholders in implementing and complying with reforms, and \n(iii) the need to conform to the overall financing requirement of the country partnership strategy \nperiod.  ADB  staff simulations  indicate  that the  benefits  of the  reforms  over the  program\u2019s \nmedium-term period\u2014from 2011 to 2016\u2014could be at least $1.87 billion (in 2010 prices). These \neconomic benefits arise from a reduction in business costs of compliance with licensing, lower \ncosts  of  trade  logistics,  an  improved  competition  policy,  and  increased  investment  in \ninfrastructure.  The  policy  adjustment  costs  to  the  government  and  the  private  sector  are \nconservatively estimated at $966 million discounted over the program\u2019s medium-term period. \nThese  adjustment  costs  include  the  administrative,  enforcement,  and  fiscal  costs  to  the \ngovernment in implementing the reforms and direct budgetary funding of the SSF and PDMF. \nThere are also substantial revenue transfers from the public sector to the private sector that \ncould amount to $1.47 billion discounted over the program\u2019s medium-term period. These arise \nfrom reforms to the VAT refund system and the abolition of the common carrier tax. 20 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n32.  Improved  governance  and  anticorruption  efforts  are  core  priorities  of  the  new \ngovernment. The government\u2019s PFM plan was announced in February 2011, and it includes a \nseries of short- to medium-term reforms building on previous accomplishments made since \n2006. The plan is supported by development partners. ADB has supported PFM reforms since \n2006, starting with the Development Policy Support Program loan completed in 2009, and \nassociated PFM TA focusing on public debt management (footnote 9). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social  \n \n33.  Subprogram 1 is categorized as some gender benefits and subprogram 2 is proposed as \neffective gender mainstreaming. Unemployment rates are higher among young women than \nyoung men. The program aims to address this gender employment gap through a set of policy \nmeasures and interventions. Key interventions include setting quotas of 50.0% or more for \nyoung  women  participating  in  the  MyFirstJob  pilot  and  55.0%  or  more  for  young  women \naccessing skills training under the Tourism Skills Development Program. Both DOLE and DOT \nwill also develop gender-responsive manuals for these two pilot programs. In PPP infrastructure \nprojects, gender-sensitive checklists will be produced and completed at the design stage. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n34.  The  program  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The following are agreed upon, \n                                                \n20 Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nand will be incorporated into the legal agreement. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram. The government agreed to cooperate, and shall cause any and all government offices, \norganizations, and entities involved in implementing the program to cooperate fully with any \nsuch investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including providing access to all \nrelevant books and records, as may be necessary, for the satisfactory completion of any such \ninvestigation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  There are four main risks to the program that are rated low to medium and are expected \nto be outweighed by the benefits of the program. These risks are that (i) there will be weak \ninteragency coordination; (ii) the capacity of agencies to implement reforms may be constrained \nby resources; (iii) the reform agenda remains sensitive to political interests; and (iv) increased \nrisks to global financial markets slows economic growth and limits budget resources to fund the \nprogram commitments. Measures to mitigate these risks are put in place and include public-\nprivate coordination and monitoring of reforms. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n \n36.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan agreement. The loan \nwill not be declared effective until the government, through the DOF, has fulfilled all conditions \nas set out in the Policy Reform Matrix (Appendix 4). \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the  programmatic  approach  for  the  Increasing  Competitiveness  for  Inclusive \nGrowth Program; and \n(ii)  the loan of $350,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Increasing  Competitiveness  for  Inclusive  Growth  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 15 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n1 June 2012 ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  By mid-2018:   National Statistics Office  Assumption \nImproved investment  (i) Philippines ranking in  household labor force  Macroeconomic \nclimate  global surveys of  survey  stability \ncompetitiveness improved by    maintained \nat least 15 places:  World Economic Forum   \n(2010 baseline: ranked 87th in  Global Competitiveness  Risk \nthe World Economic Forum  Report   Lack of effective \nGlobal Competitiveness    coordination \nReport; 109th in the Heritage  Heritage Foundation  among national \nFoundation Economic  Economic Freedom Index   government \nFreedom Index; 134th in the    departments \nWorld Bank Group Doing  Work Bank Group Doing \nBusiness Survey); and  Business  \n \n(ii) youth full-time wage \nemployment increased by an \naverage of 5.0% per annum \n(2010 baseline: average 3.4% \ngrowth in 1991\u20132010) \nOutcome  By December 2015:    Assumption \nImproved  (i) number of persons found  Department of Labor and  Government stays \ncompetitiveness of  jobs through institutionalized  Employment annual PESO  on course with key \nselected sectors  PESOs increased by 10% per  data  business \nannum (2010 baseline:    regulatory reform \naverage 1,000 persons per     \nPESO),    Risk \n    Lack of \n(ii) cost of rules and  ADB red tape survey 2012  commitment and \nregulations for key licenses  and 2014  willingness of \nreduced by 15% (baseline    government \n2012),    agencies and \n    stakeholders to \n(iii) Philippines ranking in  Official Gazette of the \nparticipate in \nglobal logistics index  Republic of the Philippines \nimplementing \nimproved by at least 10   \nreforms \nplaces (2010 baseline), and   \n   \n(iv) Philippines ranking in  World Economic Forum \nglobal tourism and travel  Global Competitiveness \ncompetitiveness index  Report on Tourism and \nimproved by at least 15  Travel \nplaces (2010 baseline) \nOutputs  By end of 2014:    Risks \n1.
