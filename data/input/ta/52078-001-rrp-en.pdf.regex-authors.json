THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Capacity Building to Foster Competition Project. \n \n2.  The  project  will  help  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  implement  the  Philippine \nCompetition Act (PCA),1 and will foster the government\u2019s capacity to enforce the competition law \nto promote free and fair competition in economic activities. The project will: (i) strengthen the \ninstitutional capacity of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) to foster competition, \n(ii) establish  a  cross-government  staff  development  program  for  competition  policy;  and \n(iii) ensure the sustainability of the reforms by establishing an academic center of excellence in \ncompetition law and policy. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development challenges. The Philippines has been an economic leader among the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries since the global financial \ncrisis in 2008. Economic growth averaged 6.3% per year during 2010\u20132018. To maintain this \nmomentum, the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2017\u20132022 continues the government\u2019s \nstrong emphasis on inclusive growth. Under the PDP, the government has set a strategic target \nto reach upper middle-income status by 2022. To meet this goal, effective market competition is \nessential as it fosters an efficient allocation of scarce resources and encourages the adoption of \nmodern  technology.  An  uncompetitive  market  is  prone  to  collusion  and  abuse  of  market \ndominance.  The  result  is  often  substandard  service  delivery  with  exorbitant  prices,  which \nadversely  affects  consumer  welfare.  Moreover,  research  indicates  that  the  adoption  of \nappropriately structured and timed competition policy can help an economy avoid the middle-\nincome trap.2 In recognition of this challenge, the PDP highlights enhancing market competition \nas  a  crosscutting  strategy.3 Accordingly,  the  government  has  committed  to  creating  an \nenvironment that penalizes anticompetitive practices, facilitates the entry of new players, and \nsupports regulatory reforms. \n \n4.  However, the Philippine competition environment remains weak and is a major factor \nconstraining  economic  growth  and  inclusiveness.  The  World  Economic  Forum  Global \nCompetitiveness Report, 2017\u20132018 ranking shows the Philippines as the 4th largest market in \nSoutheast Asia, but the country needs to improve business dynamism and product market \nefficiency (Table 1). According to product market regulation indicators, Philippine markets display \nhigher levels of restrictiveness than comparator countries4 in three main areas: (i) barriers to trade \nand  investment;  (ii)  barriers  to  entrepreneurship;  and  (iii) state  involvement  in  business \noperations.5 Notably, the Philippines has important sectors , with high market concentration that \n                                                \n1  Republic Act 10667 was signed into law on 21 July 2015. \n2  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 2016.

In addition, the price-cost margin is high in many goods \nand  services  markets,  including  beverages,  agricultural  products,  disease  and  pest  control \nservices, and many types of transport services.6 This leads to higher prices and lower welfare of \nthe population. \n \nTable 1: Global Competitiveness Index Rankings of Nine ASEAN Member States* \nBusiness    Product Market    Market    \nDynamism  Efficiency  Size \nSingapore  12  Singapore  1  Indonesia  10 \nMalaysia  21  Malaysia  12  Thailand  18 \nBrunei Darussalam  56  Thailand  37  Malaysia  24 \nViet Nam  76  Indonesia  58  Philippines  31 \nPhilippines  86  Brunei Darussalam  68  Viet Nam  32 \nThailand  93  Lao PDR  72  Singapore  37 \nIndonesia  98  Cambodia  76  Cambodia  86 \nLao PDR  129  Viet Nam  81  Lao PDR  108 \nCambodia  131  Philippines  99  Brunei Darussalam  116 \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n* The ranking is out of a total of 137 countries. \nSource: World Economic Forum. 2017. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2017\u20132018. Geneva. \n \n5.  Historically,  the  Philippines  lacked  a  unified  competition  law  and  instead  relied  on \ndispersed outdated regulations to deal with competition-related issues.7 To address this gap, the \ngovernment enacted a comprehensive competition law, the PCA, in July 2015. The law aims to: \n(i) protect consumers by giving them access to a wider choice of goods and services at lower \nprices; and (ii) promote competitive business and encourage market players to be more efficient \nand innovative. \n \n6.  The PCA formally created the PCC, an independent quasi-judicial body that promotes \ncompetition across all economic sectors. The organizational structure of the PCC consists of six \ncore offices: (i) administrative and legal; (ii) financial, planning, and management; (iii) competition \nenforcement;  (iv)  mergers  and  acquisitions;  (v)  economics;  and  (vi)  communications  and \nknowledge management. Staff grew from the initial 10 staff in 2016 to 167 staff in 2019. The \nPCC\u2019s mandate includes primary jurisdiction over enforcing and implementing the PCA and its \nimplementing rules and regulations. This includes: (i) conducting investigations and deciding \ncases involving any violation under the PCA; (ii) reviewing proposed mergers and acquisitions to \nprohibit transactions with an anti-competitive effect, (iii) applying remedies such as injunctions, \ndivestiture,  and  disgorgement  of excess  profits;   (iv)  conducting  administrative  proceedings \nincluding the issuance of sanctions, fines or penalties; and (v) issuing subpoenas to require the \nproduction  of  documents,  books  and  records.  To  meet  this  mandate,  the  PCC  executes \nmemoranda of agreement to ensure the support of sector regulators and government agencies \non competition enforcement.8 \n \n                                                \n6  The price-cost margin for a product/service is the difference between the price and the marginal cost of the \nproduct/service expressed as a percentage of the price. This measures the distance between the price and the \ncompetitive price. \n7  The 1987 Philippine Constitution and various legislation (e.g., Corporation Code, Price Act, and Electric Power \nIndustry Reform Act) governed the prohibition and regulation of monopolies, combinations in restraint of trade, and \nother unfair competitive practices.  \n8  The parties to the agreements are required to provide each other with investigation and enforcement support, and \naccess to information and documents.  \n ", "3 \n7.  These reforms are also consistent with the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025, \nwhich includes a consistent regulatory and policy environment for competition as a key priority. \nCountries adopting the ASEAN Competition Action Plan, 2016\u20132025, including the Philippines, \npursue five strategic goals: (i) enacting national competition legislation; (ii) strengthening the \ncapacity  of  competition  authorities;  (iii)  establishing  regional  cooperation  arrangements;  \n(iv) fostering competition awareness; and (v) harmonizing competition policy and law. \n \n8.  Binding  constraints.  The  PCC  faces  three  primary  constraints  in  enforcing  the \ncompetition law. First, it is newly formed and has not established its capacity and credibility as a \ncompetition authority. The PCC must install institutional functions and build technical skills to \nenforce the competition law and use its powers to investigate, stop, and prevent anticompetitive \npractices. Effective enforcement also requires intensive advocacy programs to build consensus, \nawareness, and an understanding of prohibitions under the PCA and the role of the PCC.  \n \n9.  Second, the promotion of pro-competitive policies requires close coordination with, and \nthe support of, other agencies with competition-related mandates. However, the enforcement of \ncompetition  law  is  also  new  to  these  agencies.  For  example,  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment Authority (NEDA) is responsible for high-level national policies on competition. The \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for litigating on behalf of government agencies. Upon \nreferral from the PCC, the DOJ will conduct investigations and prosecute any ensuing criminal \ncases. For litigation or court proceedings involving competition cases, the Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral (OSG) represents the PCC as statutory counsel. Further, these agencies do not have \nready opportunities to continuously learn new trends, best theories, state-of-the-art practices, and \nthe latest research on competition law and policy. Therefore, comprehensive support outside of \nthe PCC will be necessary to strengthen the technical capacity of all agencies mandated to \nenforce the PCA and promote market competition. \n \n10.  Finally,  efforts  to  develop  system-wide  capacity  must  include  a  ready  supply  of \ndomestically  sourced  expert  practitioners,  research  papers,  civil  discourse,  and  awareness \ncampaigns. Typically, the academic community plays a crucial role in completing the ecosystem \nneeded to maintain  pro-competition  policies.  However,  academia currently  lacks  programs, \ncourses, and seminars on competition law and economics. This prevents the creation of a \nsustained and reliable source of knowledge and highly qualified specialists who can maintain and \nimprove the competition regime over time. \n \n11.  Government strategy. The PDP calls for enhancing market competition by fostering an \nenvironment  that  penalizes  anticompetitive  practices, facilitates  market  entry,  and  supports \nregulatory reforms to stimulate investments and innovation. The government recognizes the \nimportance of strengthening institutional and individual capacities to create a knowledge base for \neffective implementation of the PCA. The PCC has developed a strategic and operational \nbusiness plan that incorporates an institutional capacity development assistance framework.9  \nAdditionally, the PCC completed a capacity and training needs assessment for the judiciary and \nlawyers in government agencies with competition-related mandates.10 \n \n                                                \n9  The Institutional Capacity Development Assistance Framework, 2017\u20132019 was developed with support from the \nAustralian competition authority as a diagnostic assessment of capacity gaps and support needed.  \n10 The training needs assessment was conducted as part of the \u201cSharing UK competition policy and best practice to \nsupport the formulation of the Philippines\u2019 first National Competition Policy by strengthening regulatory skills to enable \nincreased growth and reduced barriers to investment\u201d project.  \n \n ", "4 \n12.  Strategic alignment. The project supports the operational priorities of Strategy 2030 of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), as shown in Table 2.11 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the Philippines, 2018\u20132023 on capacity development.12 \n \nTable 2: Alignment with Strategy 2030\n \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Capacity Building to Foster Competition Project \nAddressing remaining  \u2022  Promoting effective competition in trade, industry, and other \npoverty and reducing  commercial economic activities will improve the business \ninequalities  environment and market efficiency, leading to lower prices and \nimproved service delivery quality, and ultimately to higher \nconsumer welfare especially for those in the lower-income groups. \nStrengthening governance  \u2022  The center of excellence on competition will improve education \nand institutional capacity  and training opportunities for current and prospective government \nofficials and stakeholders, leading to a steady stream of \ncompetition law and policy experts. \n\u2022  Government employees in agencies with competition-related \nmandates will be provided with lifelong learning opportunities on \ncompetition policy to create a critical mass of reform-minded \ngovernment officials that can improve the competition environment \nover time. \n Source: Asian Development Bank \n \n13.  Development coordination.  The United States Agency for International Development \nsupported the legal drafting and approval process of the PCA. The Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development and other bilateral development agencies such as Australia, \nGermany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom have contributed to the \nestablishment of a competition policy framework in the Philippines. Initiatives include the research \nand development of knowledge products, policy advisory and advocacy, and training for various \nlevels of government officials on competition policy. As a newly established institution, the PCC \nhas actively sought assistance from various donors. The PCC established a dedicated unit to \nmonitor the progress of development partner assistance, ensure the optimal use of resources, \nand minimize the risk of duplication. ADB has assisted the PCC with this task by taking on the \ncoordinating  role  as  lead  development  partner.  Further,  the  PCC  regularly  organizes  the \nPartnerships for Competition Development Forum, which serves as the coordination platform.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  market  competition  enhanced,  as \nenvisaged in the PDP. The project will have the following outcome: competition environment \nimproved.13  \n \n15.  Output  1:  Institutional  capacity  of  the  Philippine  Competition  Commission \nstrengthened.  This  output  will  increase  the  PCC\u2019s  capacity  in  core  functions  such  as \nenforcement, economics investigation, and advocacy. First, assistance will be provided to build \nan operational foundation, including: (i) an operations manual for enforcement, and mergers and \nacquisitions; (ii) policies to facilitate the prioritization of case-work; (iii) a document/evidence \nmanagement system; (iv) communication strategies and outreach programs;14 and (v) signing \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2018.

Second, international experts will provide on-the-job training and advisory \nservices in the following areas: (i) investigation; (ii) economic analysis in support of the detection \nand  investigation  of  anticompetitive  behavior;  (iii)  market  studies  in  priority  sectors  where \nsubstantial  impact  on  consumer  welfare  and  market  efficiency  is  expected;  and \n(iv) communications and media campaigns. This combination of institution building with on-the \njob training will accelerate the development of the PCC and quickly increase its relevance and \neffectiveness. \n \n16.  Output 2: Government staff development program for competition developed. This \noutput will provide key staff of other relevant government agencies with competition-related \nmandates (primarily NEDA, DOJ and OSG), as well as staff of the PCC, with opportunities to \nenhance their skills and knowledge. First, to reinforce the on-the-job training provided under \noutput 1, staff of the PCC will undertake secondments to gain a structured insight into the workings \nof well-established competition authorities. Second, staff of the PCC and other relevant agencies \nwill be able to pursue nondegree programs, short-term courses (domestic and international), and \ndistance learning courses in key areas of competition law to learn current international best \npractices.  Third,  the  program  will  include  scholarships  for  degree  programs  \n(i.e., master\u2019s and Doctor of Philosophy) with the aim of providing educational opportunities to \nbuild the technical skills of competition practitioners and develop a critical mass of skilled and \nreform-minded staff. Participation in the program will be limited primarily to the PCC, NEDA, DOJ \nand OSG to prevent dilution and to more effectively utilize the limited resources.15 Domestic \nacademic programs will also be offered to provide a balance in exposure and minimize the \ndisruption of long staff absences. The program will also utilize a reentry capstone project to \nminimize staff retention risk. \n \n17.  Output  3:  An  academic  center  of  excellence  in  competition  law  and  policy \nestablished. The academic community is an important channel for building up and maintaining a \nspecialized competition knowledge base. Such expertise helps build a constituency of experts \nwho can support the system of competition law and make it work more effectively at all levels.16 \nThis output will support the establishment of a center of excellence at the University of the \nPhilippines (UP) to nurture local expertise in competition law, policy, and economics. The center \nwill conduct outreach activities to promote better understanding of competition policy and build up \nknowledge through research and publications. The center will provide incentives (including \nfellowships  and  research  grants)  to  perform  world-class  research  and  attract  talented \nresearchers, experts, and students. The center will enter into collaborative arrangements with \nother centers of excellence and universities as well as with the PCC.17 Specifically, the center will: \n(i) provide full degree programs for competition law and economics at the graduate and/or \nundergraduate  level;  (ii)  award  research  grants  for  graduate  students  and  junior  faculty; \n(iii) organize seminars, talks, and forums on competition law and policy in tertiary institutions; \n(iv) develop teaching materials, textbooks, case studies, and discussion papers; (v) develop \ndistance  learning  short  and  long  duration  courses;  (vi)  organize  seminar  series  and  small \nconferences for  academic  and  policy  research  community  to  share research findings;  and  \n(vii) publish discussion papers and policy briefs.  \n \n                                                \n15  Beneficiaries will include staff from the NEDA, the DOJ, and the OSG. \n16  ASEAN. 2017.

ADB laid the foundations for establishing a competition policy framework in the Philippines \nthrough  an  investment  climate  technical  assistance,18  followed  by  a  policy-based  loan  on \nincreasing  competitiveness.19  ADB  has  supported  the  work  program  of  the  PCC  since  its \nestablishment in 2016, including the development of investigative techniques and quantitative \nanalysis.20 The proposed project will add value by approaching capacity development in a holistic \nmanner that strengthens outcomes and increases sustainability. The project will develop the \nPCC\u2019s institutional foundations while supporting live interventions, which would mutually reinforce \neach other. Furthermore, the project will strengthen the capacity of partner government agencies. \nThis will create synergies by building teamwork and shared knowledge, creating a virtuous cycle \nthat further builds institutional capacity. Finally, an academic center of excellence on competition \nlaw and policy in the Philippines will be launched to meet the increased demand for competition \npolicy practitioners, research, and advocacy. \n \n19.  Lessons learned from previous capacity-building programs were reflected in the project \ndesign, including that: (i) newly acquired skills should be fully aligned to the agency\u2019s corporate \ngoals;  (ii)  support  should  not  spread  across  a  large  number  of  agencies,  as  otherwise \norganizational impact is difficult to achieve; and (iii) advanced competition enforcement requires \nvery focused training.21 \n \nD.

The government will \nfinance the staff cost, travel, office operations, and applicable taxes and duties, equivalent to  \n$4.3 million, and financing charges estimated at $1.7 million, which will be covered through annual \nbudget allocation. \n \nTable 4:  Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \n   Ordinary capital resources (regular loan)  23.3  79.52 \nGovernment   6.0  20.48 \nTotal  29.3  100.00 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The project implementation period is from January 2020 to December 2025. The executing \nagency  for  the  project  is  the  PCC,  which  will  oversee  overall  project  implementation  and \nmanagement  activities.  The  PCC,  through  the  project  management  unit  (PMU),  will  be \nresponsible for implementing outputs 1 and 2, whereas UP will be the implementing agency for \noutput 3. \n \n24.  A project steering committee will be established and chaired by the PCC, with the NEDA \nas vice chair. Other members of the steering committee will include the Department of Finance, \nthe Department of Trade and Industry, and the UP. The project steering committee will meet \nregularly (at least twice a year) to: (i) review project implementation progress; (ii) guide and \nsupport  project  implementation;  and  (iii)  coordinate  between  agencies  involved  in  project \nimplementation. The PMU will be established within, and overseen by, the PCC and will be \nresponsible for the day-to-day coordination and oversight of the project. The PMU will comprise \nthe following personnel: a project manager, scholarship management specialist, monitoring and \nevaluation specialist, procurement specialist, financial management specialist, administration \nassistant, and secretary. Tasks of the PMU will include managing procurement activities, carrying \nout  the  competitive  selection  process  for  candidates  proposed  for  scholarships,  scholar \nplacement,  scholarship  program  management,  and  project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 22). \n \n ", "8 \nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \n \nImplementation period  January 2020\u2013December 2025 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2025 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2026 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  The Project steering committee, chaired by the PCC.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The PCC has developed its institutional capacity development assistance framework \n(footnote 9). The PCC\u2019s legal and economic experts need to have the capacity to effectively and \nefficiently  conduct  investigations,  review  merger  transactions,  carry  out  economic  analysis, \ninstitute administrative proceedings before the PCC, and pursue cases against illegal practices \nsuch as cartelistic behavior and abuse of dominant market positions. Diverse skills are needed, \nincluding  detecting  cartels,  receiving  and  handling  complaints,  reviewing  mergers,  drafting \ncharging documents, presenting evidence in a hearing, and conducting research studies relevant \nto promoting competitive markets. Two broad groups require capacity building: PCC\u2019s internal \npersonnel,  and  staff  of  partner  agencies  in  competition  law  enforcement  and  policy \nimplementation. The objectives of the capacity building are to: (i) equip staff with the knowledge, \nskills, and ability to carry out their mandate effectively; (ii) enhance agencies\u2019 capacity to advance \ntheir positions on pro-competition policies in local and international contexts; (iii) build a strong, \nwell-informed, and educated PCC staff to carry out the functions of the PCC; and (iv) establish a \nsystem of continued skills upgrading of PCC  staff. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  The anticipated economic benefits of the project include: (i) an increase in gross domestic \nproduct because of more efficient allocation and use of resources and a resulting one-off rise in \ntotal factor productivity; and (ii) faster economic growth because of greater efficiency of the \n ", "9 \neconomy, more innovation, and more rapid growth of total factor productivity. The investments \nare considered economically viable. The economic analysis resulted in an economic internal rate \nof return of 22.4% and a net present value of $13 million. The additional revenue the project will \ngenerate for the government will be more than sufficient to cover all recurrent costs of the project \nafter implementation, interest payments under the ADB loan, and repayment of the ADB loan. \nHence, the project is financially sustainable.23 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  The project will build the capacity of the participating agencies by strengthening their \nhuman resources in competition-related functional areas and enhancing their ability to initiate and \nmanage reforms. Sustaining the high level of expertise developed in the PCC will require creating \na broader educational environment that ensures an increased pool of technical expertise. To \ncomplete the ecosystem, the center of excellence to be established at the UP will deepen the \nbench of prospective PCC staff and its advisory network. The PCC will benefit from strategic \npartnerships with local and international academic institutions to cultivate research and instruction \nin competition law. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  A financial management assessment has been carried out to review the capacity of the \nPCC regarding its financial management system and procedures. The financial management risk \nis moderate (pre-mitigation) mainly because of: (i) weaknesses in budget execution; (ii) limited \nstaff in the finance, planning, and management office; (iii) lack of internal audit service; and  \n(iv) lack of computerized budgeting and bookkeeping systems. The government and ADB have \nagreed to a number of measures to control these risks.24 A PMU will be established to, among \nothers, address financial management issues. The PMU will be staffed by qualified professionals, \nincluding a project manager, finance specialist, and performance monitoring specialist to ensure \nthat  the  project  is  implemented  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  and  procedural \nrequirements.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the PCC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  The objective of introducing competition into the market is to prevent control of the market \nby a select few companies, which can lead to collusion and price distortion against consumer \nwelfare. The proposed project will promote free and fair competition to temper prices and increase \nservice quality in non-competitive industries, leading to improved consumer welfare and better \nsocio-economic opportunities especially for those in low-income groups. \n \n30.  The project is categorized as having some gender elements. The government will ensure \nthat women participation in all trainings programs under the project will be at least proportional to \nthe share of women employed at the relevant agencies. The government will further ensure that \nall monitoring and evaluation data will be disaggregated by sex. \n \n \n                                                \n23 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents from Appendix 2). \n24 Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents from Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nF.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),25  the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows:  Category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples. \n \nG.

ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The government and the PCC have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.  The government and the PCC have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $23,300,000 \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Capacity Building to Foster Competition Project, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 28 years, \nincluding a grace period of 9 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n14 November 2019 \n                                                \n25 ADB.
