INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming midterm review mission held in Beijing in June 2010, \nthe government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) \nto help the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) ensure that international best practice approaches \nare incorporated in the development of national eco-compensation legislation. ADB received a \nwritten proposal prepared by the Department of Western Region Development of the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) in August 2010. The proposal indicates that the \ndevelopment of an ecological compensation ordinance is listed as a legislative program to be \ndrafted by NDRC. At the request of the PRC  government, ADB fielded a reconnaissance \nmission to Beijing in September 2010, and held discussions with NDRC to clarify and agree on \nthe scope, impact, outcome, outputs, costs, and financing arrangements for the TA. Following a \nsuccessful conference on the payment for ecosystem services (PES) in 2009, ADB and NDRC \njointly organized a second international conference on PES in October 2010 with a focus on \neco-compensation legislation and payments for watershed services. The TA for a study on eco-\ncompensation regulations was presented and discussed during that conference. The TA builds \non past and ongoing ADB achievements and interventions, and focuses specifically on bringing \nin global best practice approaches in the development of national eco-compensation legislation \nin the PRC. The PES mechanism supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities in Strategy 2020,1 which \naims  to  promote  inclusive  economic  growth,  environmental  sustainability,  and  regional \nintegration.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Natural systems like forests, wetlands, and watersheds provide a wide variety of goods \nand  services,  and  contribute  to  human  well-being  and  poverty  reduction.3 Many  of  these \nservices are provided indirectly, i.e., with no direct link between the service provider and the \nconsumer of the service, perhaps due to the spatial separation between the environmental \nservices providers (often landowners or resource managers in the upper watershed) and the \nusers of the same environmental services (beneficiaries such as consumers of potable water, or \nindustries or agriculture located downstream). Therefore, the market for these services is often \nnot  present  and  the  ecosystem  managers  have  little  economic  incentive  to  improve \nenvironmental  management.  As  a  result,  in  most  places,  environmental  services  are \nundersupplied, therefore fewer or inferior quality services are made available than desirable. \n \n3.  In the PRC, the traditional approach to ensure the provision of environmental services \nhas been through eco-compensation payments made directly from the government to providers \nof environmental services. PES-related regulations have also been mainly limited to local areas. \nHowever,  since  2005, the  State  Council  has  been  giving  urgency  to the  establishment  of \neffective  ecological  compensation  mechanisms.  The  government  continues  to  assign  high \npriority to the protection of the ecological environment.  \n \n4.  The  government  recently  emphasized  the  need  to  revisit  the  legal  and  institutional \nmechanisms for environment protection. In 2008, the Decision of the Central Committee of the \nCommunist  Party  of  China  on  Several  Significant  Issues  in  Promoting  Rural  Reform  and \nDevelopment adopted in the Third Plenary Session of the 17th Communist Party of China \nCentral Committee stressed the need for an incentive mechanism to facilitate the protection of \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 Dec 2010. \n3  Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. http://www.maweb.org/   \n ", "2   \nsuch  natural  resources  as  arable  lands,  water  areas,  forests,  grasslands,  wetlands,  and \nagricultural species resources.  \n \n5.  The improved regulatory framework resulting from this TA will contribute to enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability. The national eco-compensation legislative framework aims to set \nprinciples that will help clarify rights and responsibilities over ecosystem services and natural \nresources, resolving equity issues, and improving strategic environmental planning. This effort \nwill stimulate innovation in environmental policy, including the development of more incentive-\nbased  management  regimes,  and  greater  adoption  of  and  innovation  in  market-based \ninstruments.    \n \n6.  ADB supported the first and second international conferences on PES in the PRC in \nNovember 2009 and October 2010. The TA will build on past and ongoing ADB interventions \nand focus specifically on introducing global best practice approaches in the development of \nnational eco-compensation legislation in the PRC. The lessons and issues identified at these \nconferences have provided the basis for the formulation of the TA.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  improved  environmental  management  and  sustainable \ndevelopment in the PRC by adding value to the overall eco-compensation policy development \nprocess. The impact of the TA is improved legislation for environmental management and \nsustainable development in the PRC. The TA will support the government in achieving its \nbroader  objectives  of  attaining  an  \u201cecological  civilization,\u201d4 and  support  the  government  in \nmeeting  its  targets  of  having  the  highest  legislation  in  place  for  issues  related  to  eco-\ncompensation.  The  outcome  is  that  national  eco-compensation  legislation  in  the  PRC  is \ndeveloped.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Output 1: National drafting team trained and a review on international approaches \nin eco-compensation and PES legislation prepared. The TA will enable capacity building of \nthe national eco-compensation legislation drafting team on international approaches with regard \nto PES legislation. The specific activities include (i) two teams (of five individuals each) conduct \nstudy tours to two separate groups of countries (proposed destinations group 1: Australia and \nNew Zealand; and group 2: Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom); and (ii) prepare \nreview reports on legislation relating to PES and eco-compensation in the visited countries, \ndocument the learning experience, and make a presentation at the midterm workshop.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Detailed technical (thematic) study reports on nine focal areas of eco-\ncompensation. The nine thematic study reports will focus on the following eco-compensation \nfocal  areas:  (i)  legislative  framework  for  eco-compensation,  (ii)  wetland  eco-compensation, \n(iii) forest ecological benefit compensation, (iv) regional eco-compensation approaches, (v) river \nbasin  eco-compensation,  (vi)  compensation  for  exploitation  and  utilization  of  resources,  \n                                                \n4  The concept of \u201cecological civilization\u201d in the PRC is a future-oriented guiding principle based on the perception of \nthe extremely high price the country has paid for the economic miracle. The concept reflects an important change \nin the PRC's understanding of development. Rather than emphasizing economic construction as the core of \ndevelopment as in the past, the government has come to realize that development, if sustainable, must entail a list \nof elements including the right relationship between man and nature. (China Daily. 2007. Ecological Civilization. \nhttp://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2007-10/24/content_6201964.htm)  \n ", "  3 \n(vii) marine eco-compensation, (viii) collection of ecological compensation tax, and (ix) modeling \nof eco-compensation impacts on the economy. The thematic field studies will be conducted in \nselected  provinces  across  the  country.  They  will  capture  the  various  local  innovative \napproaches  being  used  in  the  PRC  to  provide  guidance  for  the  development  of  national \nlegislation.  Local  thematic  workshops  will  be  organized  with  participants  from  the  various \ngovernment  sectors  and  civil  society  representation.  The  wide-ranging  participation  at  the \nworkshops  will  ensure  discussion  on  ecosystem  and  livelihood  issues  in  relation  to  eco-\ncompensation legislation development. The thematic studies will be led by the relevant thematic \nexperts  under  the  guidance  of  the  lead  expert,  with  input  from  the  international  expert. \nWorkshop reports will be made available.   \n \n10.  Output 3: First draft of national eco-compensation legislation for the PRC. Based \non international experience (i.e., output 1), input from the thematic study reports and local \nthematic workshops (output 2), the national drafting team will prepare the first draft of the eco-\ncompensation regulations. The drafting team will undertake the drafting process in accordance \nwith national procedures.   \n \n11.  Output 4: An appropriate knowledge product on lessons from the development of \neco-compensation legislation based on the PRC experience. The specific objective and \nscope of the knowledge product has not yet been determined. This will be decided through a \nconsultative process during TA implementation. However the overall purpose of the knowledge \nproduct will be to highlight the importance of a regulatory framework for eco-compensation in \nthe PRC context, to document how international best-practice principles have been incorporated \ninto the draft PRC eco-compensation regulation development process, and to document and \ncommunicate some of the innovative policy approaches currently being taken in the PRC with \nregard to PES.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA cost is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013other  sources).  The \ngovernment will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent in local currency through in-kind \ncontribution, which will include (i) counterpart staff time, remuneration, and travel expenses;  \n(ii) logistic support in arranging workshops and conferences; and (iii) costs such as for acquiring \nforeign legislation information, translation of documents, and steering committee meetings. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Department of Western Region Development of NDRC is the executing agency for \nthe TA. A project management office will be set up within NDRC and be responsible for day-to-\nday TA operations, including overseeing the TA consultants\u2019 work plans, reviewing their outputs, \nand  coordinating  with  the  consultants  for  the  preparation  of  the  national  and  provincial \nworkshops.  An  advance  payment  facility  will  be  established  for  TA  implementation.  TA \nimplementation will be closely coordinated with various agencies, particularly with the Ministry of \nEnvironmental Protection.5  \n \n                                                \n5  The Ministry of Environmental Protection is currently the executing agency for another ADB TA project related to \neco-compensation, i.e., ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing National \nGuidelines for Eco-Compensation in River Basins and a Framework for Soil Pollution Management (TA 7217-\nPRC). \n ", "4   \n14.  The  State  Council  has  approved  the  development  of  national  eco-compensation \nlegislation and mandated NDRC to take the lead on this. NDRC has therefore established a \nhigh-level  multisector  leading  group  (chaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  NDRC),  and  another \nmultisector working group (the drafting team) with representation from all relevant line ministries. \nThese will ensure close coordination and input from all agencies throughout TA implementation. \nTo oversee TA implementation, the leading group will function as the steering committee.   \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, tentatively scheduled from March 2011 to \nFebruary 2013. Ten individual consultants will be engaged to conduct studies that contribute to \nthe drafting of the eco-compensation legislation. An estimated 62.5 person-months of consulting \nservices will comprise the services of an international expert for 3.5 person-months and nine \nindividual national experts for 59 person-months. ADB will engage the consultants following its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The individual \nconsultant  selection  modality  will  be  used  because  studies  related  to  eco-compensation \nlegislation comprise a highly specialized subject; thus identifying an available firm with sufficient \nexpertise to implement this study would be difficult. In addition, separate responsibilities are \nrequired to produce the nine thematic reports. The outline terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 3. A proposed outline for the thematic study report is provided in Appendix 4. \nThe  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Both the team leader and deputy team leader \nwill each be responsible for one thematic area. The specific terms of reference for the seven \nexperts will be elaborated by the team leader, international consultant, and deputy team leader, \nupon refinement of the study framework. \n \n16.  The outcome and outputs of the TA will be presented during national workshops and \nposted on the ADB and NDRC websites. The TA will produce a knowledge product (i.e. output 4) \nbased on lessons from TA implementation. The scope and target audience for the knowledge \nproduct will be determined during TA implementation. This will in turn determine the specific \ncommunication strategies and plans for the dissemination of the knowledge product.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for the Study on Eco-Compensation Regulations, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved legislation  National legislation on eco- Annual reports of the  The government is \nfor environmental  compensation in place by  Department of  committed to implementing \nmanagement and  2016  Western Region  the new eco-compensation \nsustainable  Development of  legislation development \ndevelopment in the  NDRC  process. \nPRC \nOutcome      Assumptions \nNational eco- Draft national legislation  Project report reviews  Various sectors have \ncompensation  incorporating international  sufficient understanding of \nAnnual reports of \nlegislation in the PRC  best-practice principles  and commitment to the \nNDRC \nis developed  prepared by March 2013  need for mainstreaming \nAnnual reports of  eco-compensation \nother relevant  legislation. \nagencies \nThe general public and \n  provincial governments \nprovide sufficient support \non the importance and \nneed for such legislation. \nEnvironmental, social, \neconomic, and cultural \nimpacts and benefits of the \nproposed legislation are \nthoroughly addressed in \nrelevant associated \nstudies. \nOutputs      Assumptions \nNational drafting  One report on international  Minutes of the  The TA steering committee \nteam trained, and a  approaches to eco- steering committee  provides timely and quality \nreview on  compensation regulations  meetings  advice and guidance. \ninternational  (based on study tour) \nTA review missions  Concerns and comments \napproaches in eco- prepared by NDRC by \nand reports  from grassroots and civil \ncompensation and  month 8  \nsociety in relation to the \nPES legislation    Consultant technical \nnational eco-compensation \nprepared     reports from study  \nlegislation development \n   \nRegular dialogue and  are sufficiently captured \n   \nfeedback from NDRC  and incorporated. \n   \nand Ministry of \n    Effective interministerial \nFinance \n    coordination is developed \n    through the institutional \n    setup of the TA. \n   \nDetailed technical  Field case studies for each \n(thematic) study  of the nine thematic areas \nreports on nine focal  initiated by month 6 and \nareas (legislative  completed by month 14 \nframework, wetlands,   \nforests, regional   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \napproaches, river   \nbasin, resource   \nexploitation, marine,   \ncollection of   \necological   \ncompensating tax,   \nand modeling of   \neconomic impacts) of   \neco-compensation   \n   \nFirst draft of national  Framework for eco-\neco-compensation  compensation legislation \nlegislation for the  presented at inception \nPRC  workshop \n   \n  Draft national eco-\n  compensation legislation \n  presented at mid-term and \n  final workshops \n   \n  Advanced draft of national \n  eco-compensation \n  legislation prepared by \n  month 23 and presented to \n  steering committee \n   \nA knowledge product  Concept for most \non lessons from the  appropriate knowledge \ndevelopment of eco- product developed by \ncompensation  month 15 based on target \nlegislation  audience and purpose \n \n Activities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \nGeneral   ADB (TASF\u2013other sources): $500,000 \n1.1 Mobilize team of experts, develop study framework, and \nAmount \norganize inception workshop (by month 2).
