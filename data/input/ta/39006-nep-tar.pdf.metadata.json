INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved in December 2004 a loan for the Gender \nEquality  and  Empowerment  of  Women  (GEEOW)  Project  in  Nepal,  to  facilitate  a  process  of \neconomic, social, legal, and political empowerment among poor rural women, including ethnic and \nlow-caste women. However, during the GEEOW Project\u2019s preparation, a need was recognized for \nan additional specific delivery mechanism to reach the most disadvantaged members of society. \nThe  Government  requested  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  respond  to  this  need.  ADB \nconsidered this request, and a concept paper was prepared and endorsed for funding by the \nPoverty Reduction Cooperation Fund at its Fifth Strategy Meeting in June 2004. Subsequently, a \nTA fact-finding mission visited Nepal from 2 to 8 December 2004 and held discussions with the \nGovernment and development partners. The Government and ADB reached an understanding \nregarding  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Poverty in Nepal remains concentrated among the rural poor and women and various \ndisadvantaged  ethnic  and  caste  groups.  While  there  has  been  some  progress  in  addressing \ngender-based discrimination, there has been considerably less progress in addressing caste- and \nethnicity-based  exclusion.  Nepal\u2019s  society  is  multiethnic,  with  complex  variations  in  caste, \nlanguage, and religion, with the Hindu caste system prevailing. The society is governed by a \nsophisticated system of rules and behavioral norms, and the caste system, although officially \nabolished in 1964, defines access to resources. Upward mobility is extremely limited, and social \nexclusion is one major reason for persistent unequal access to resources, rights, and opportunities \nin Nepal.  \n \n3.  Past  impact  assessments  of  rural  development  programs  show  that  the  most \ndisadvantaged households of a community have often not participated in or benefited from these \nprograms. For example, the ADB-funded Microcredit Project for Women2 was able to reach only \nthe middle income women of rural Nepal.3 Conventional delivery mechanisms have not always \nbeen  sufficient  to  reach  the  most  disadvantaged  households,  who  are  confronted  with  the \nchallenges of (i) ensuring food subsistence and basic family needs and (ii) trying to improve family \nincomes. Their coping strategies to meet survival needs consume almost all of their time, thus \npreventing  their  participation  in  mainstream  development  programs.  Even  well-designed \ndevelopment  programs  may  not  match  the  capabilities  and  responsiveness  of  the  most \ndisadvantaged households. Life cycle studies in Nepal show that, besides a low level of skills and \nlack of inherited capital assets, the most disadvantaged households tend to contain relatively \nyoung parents and children. With a high dependency ratio, these households struggle to meet \nbasic  needs  during  the  first  15  years  of  marriage,  and  they  lack  the  resources  and  time  to \nparticipate  consistently  and  fully  in  development  activities.  Unless  the  most  disadvantaged \nhouseholds receive specific assistance, these households may not be able to improve their living \nconditions until the children start working and the dependency ratio decreases. Development \nprojects have difficulty reaching the most disadvantaged households during the most impoverished \nperiods of their life cycles, thus allowing few of them to participate. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 31 March 2005. \n2  ADB. 1993.

ADB assistance under the 2005\u20132009 country strategy and program will ensure greater \ninvolvement of disadvantaged groups in the mainstream development process, to improve their \naccess  to  resources  and  achieve  a  more  inclusive  and  accountable  delivery  of  basic  social \nservices. The TA will facilitate the outcomes of the country strategy and program by focusing on \ninclusive social development and social protection, in particular facilitating the participation of the \nmost disadvantaged households in mainstream development activities. Possible synergies will be \nbuilt with other ADB projects and other social protection programs of the Government.4 The TA will \ncontribute to the poverty reduction objectives of the Government, through fostering social inclusion. \nThe TA will also provide a direct input to the \u201dtargeted programs for the ultra-poor, vulnerable, and \ndeprived groups\u201d pillar of the Tenth 5-Year National Plan,5 according to which special efforts and \ninnovative modalities would be needed to involve the most disadvantaged groups in mainstream \nactivities.    \n \n5.  To  effectively  reach  the  most  disadvantaged  groups,  special  design  features  of \ndevelopment projects are needed to ensure (i) equitable distribution of benefits of development \nprograms, (ii) adequate changes of attitude and behavior of the most disadvantaged groups that \ntranslate into positive socioeconomic improvement during development projects, and (iii) necessary \nadvancement from being the most disadvantaged groups to being beneficiaries reachable by \nmainstream development projects. An innovative mechanism has been designed for the TA, based \non lessons learned from other similar community-driven initiatives implemented in South Asia, such \nas the Income Generation for Vulnerable Group Development Program of the Bangladesh Rural \nAdvancement Committee (Appendix 2).  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA will be the reduction of extreme poverty and a more equitable impact \nof rural development interventions, through the integration of the most disadvantaged households, \nincluding those from low-caste and ethnic minority groups, in development programs. The outcome \nis to allow the most disadvantaged households to effectively participate in and benefit from rural \ndevelopment projects, including the GEEOW Project, through the implementation of an innovative \npackage of activities aimed at the acceleration of their socioeconomic status and the removal of \nsociocultural  and  financial  constraints  that  keep  them  from  participating  effectively  in  these \ndevelopment programs. The main expected outputs of the TA are (i) improved socioeconomic \nstatus of the most disadvantaged households; (ii) improved sociocultural environment for these \nhouseholds,  which  allows  them  to  participate  in  community  decision-making  processes  and \ndevelopment programs; and (iii) strengthened capacity of local governments to (a) identify the most \ndisadvantaged households and implement programs for the livelihood protection and improvement \nof these and (b) monitor the impact of interventions on them.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.    To achieve the impact and outputs, the TA will support the following activities: (i) establish \nvillage lists of the most disadvantaged households; (ii) establish and implement the Household \nDevelopment Grant (HDG), to allow the most disadvantaged households to boost their self-esteem \nand uplift household assets; (iii) build capacity of local government officials to target and monitor \nbeneficiaries and build beneficiary confidence and develop beneficiary skills; (iv) monitor activities \n                                                 \n4  The Helpless Widow Allowance and the Disability Allowance are examples. Descriptions of these programs can be \nfound in ADB. 2004. Social Protection Study for Nepal. Manila. \n5  National Planning Commission. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2002-2007. Kathmandu, Nepal. ", "3 \nand record lessons learned; and (v) manage the TA. The TA will use a two-step approach to \npoverty reduction that will involve (i) livelihood protection, to reduce the vulnerability of the most \ndisadvantaged households, and (ii) livelihood promotion, to increase their incomes, productivity, or \nemployment opportunities. After 24 months of this two-step approach, households are expected to \nfully participate in development programs.  \n \n8.  These activities will be implemented in four of the GEEOW Project\u2019s districts and reach \nabout 1,000 households in 20 village development committees (VDCs), to be selected with the \nsame criteria used by the GEEOW Project.6 The beneficiaries of the TA (Appendix 2) will be the \nmost disadvantaged7 households that have not benefited from past development programs and \nhave suffered from exclusion and severe poverty for centuries. These households are so poor that \nthey could be bypassed by the GEEOW Project, despite related efforts to include disadvantaged \nmembers of communities. TA activities will focus particular attention on poor ethnic and low-caste \nhouseholds, to ensure that benefits will accrue more readily to these,8 and incorporate specific \nmechanisms to avoid intrahousehold gender-based discrimination.  \n \n9.    Component  1:  Selection  of  Beneficiaries,  Community  Awareness,  and  Social \nIntermediation. This component will establish (i) lists of the most disadvantaged households of the \nVDCs and (ii) priority needs and demands of targeted households. Community-based selection of \nthe most disadvantaged households will be carried out. The TA will use existing mechanisms, \nwhere possible, to establish the lists of village households by socioeconomic level.9 Where existing \nmechanisms are not in place, a participatory approach will be used to ensure ownership and \nprevent conflict within communities by involving all stakeholders (i.e., religious leaders and district \ndevelopment committees; rich and poor members of society; and community elders, students, and \nteachers) in the process of identifying the most disadvantaged households. The approach of the \nTA will be explained to all villagers, to gain acceptance from those who have been excluded from \nthe lists through existing local conflict resolution arrangements. To ensure transparency, once the \nlists of beneficiaries are established, these lists will be posted, along with the selection criteria used \nand the results of the priority needs and demands assessment. A community-level monitoring and \nfeedback mechanism will be established at the outset of the TA. Group formation among the \nselected households will be supported by the TA, to facilitate collective social capital building, \nindividual capacity building, and actual preparation of household development plans. \n \n10.   Component 2: The Household Development Grant. The HDG will involve a grant of \nabout $350.00 equivalent per household for a total of $350,000 over a period of 24 months.10 The \ngrant will be partially in-kind and partially in cash. Fifty percent of the grant, to be spent in the first \n12 months of implementation, will be entirely in-kind and designed to allow the members of the \nmost disadvantaged households to participate in community activities and social mobilization and \nawareness programs by paying for the social costs. In line with this, (i) 25% of the grant ($87.50 \nequivalent per household) will cover basic needs (such as food during the lean period, house \nrepairs, equipment for cooking and sleeping, clothing, and health care [basic]); (ii) 25% of the grant \n($87.50 equivalent per household) will cover the opportunity cost related to beneficiaries attending \n                                                 \n6  These criteria include poverty indicators, women empowerment indicators, and percentages of low-caste and ethnic \nminority group members. \n7  \u201cDisadvantaged\u201d is used to include the economically disadvantaged (those deprived of basic needs, capital assets, \nand skills) and the socially, culturally, and politically excluded (those deprived of basic rights and social services). \n8  TA activities will comply with ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people and strengthen the GEEOW Project's efforts to \ncomply with the policy. \n9  The GEEOW Project\u2019s additional criteria for gender-based discrimination will be added to the selection criteria in \nAppendix 4.  \n10  The $350 has been estimated based on lessons learned from previous projects, and its appropriateness will be tested \nat the outset of the TA. ", "4     \ncommunity-based activities; and (iii) 50% of the grant, to be provided either in cash or in-kind over \nthe  last  12  months,  will  facilitate  basic  economic  activities,  such  as  livestock  raising  and \nmicrobusinesses and small-scale agriculture and off-farm employment. A demand-driven approach \nbased on a needs and strengths assessment will be used, leading to a development plan for each \nhousehold that will be agreed under the TA. Some funds will be used to meet urgent needs of \nhouseholds (the livelihood protection), while the remaining funds will be used to build lasting assets \nthat can provide additional income (the livelihood promotion).  \n \n11.   Component 3: Capacity Building. The TA will have to enhance the most disadvantaged \nhouseholds\u2019 capacities to decide matters relating to their members\u2019 lives and develop livelihoods in \nthe long term. Confidence building, skills development, and job training will be conducted at the \nhousehold and group levels. Training will be provided to (i) build individual and social confidence, \n(ii) increase labor productivity for employment, and (iii) improve skills for economic activities with \ncomparative advantages. The training modules will be prepared by the Executing Agency and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), based on the priority needs and strengths assessment \nconducted at the outset of the TA. This training, implemented by specialized local agencies, will \nallow the most disadvantaged households to gain the confidence and skills needed to participate in \ncommunity-based activities, develop and manage sustainable small businesses, and accept new \nemployment opportunities. NGOs specializing in poverty mapping and implementation of transfers, \nas well as participatory monitoring (by implementing some TA activities and working together with \nstaff members of the Department of Women Development [DWD]), will build their own capacity to \nidentify indicators and beneficiaries, deliver in-kind and cash transfers, and monitor and evaluate \nthrough participatory processes that will consist of on-the-job training. \n \n12.   Component  4:  Monitoring  and  Lessons  Learned.  The  progress  and  impact  of  TA \nactivities will be monitored on a regular basis and evaluated annually, using a set of impact and \nprocess indicators at the household and community levels. These indicators will be identified at the \noutset of the TA. The initial baseline and subsequent monitoring, limited to key indicators identified \nlocally through a participatory process, will be carried out externally by a specialized NGO. DWD\u2019s \ndistrict level women development officers (WDOfs) and villagers will be involved in monitoring \nactivities, to build their capacity in participatory monitoring and evaluation. A village-level self-\nmonitoring system will be established, and the grant recipients will ensure that (i) the beneficiaries \nwill use all cash received in the ways planned and agreed and (ii) the communities\u2019 women leaders \nwill assist in the distribution of in-kind and cash grants, to ensure transparency. Lessons learned \nwill be recorded, and an assessment of whether or not this grant mechanism can be replicated in \nother ADB-funded projects, to increase impacts on the most disadvantaged groups, will be carried \nout. Workshops will be used to disseminate the results within ADB and to government agencies \nand  NGOs  involved  in  rural  development  and  social  protection.  The  impact  of  the  GEEOW \nProject\u2019s activities in VDCs where the HDG is in place and VDCs where it is not will be assessed \nand compared under the loan. \n \n13.   Component 5: Technical Assistance Management. The TA will be centrally managed by \nDWD and the TA coordinator. WDOfs will be responsible for management at the district level and \nwill outsource to NGOs the implementation of TA activities. The district project team of the GEEOW \nProject will play a crucial role in (i) supervising communities and approving their key decisions, to \nensure that the investment is implemented in accordance with defined criteria and requirements; \n(ii)  applying  checks  and  balances  to  community  implementation  as  a  part  of  the  process  of \nensuring accountability; (iii) handling overall management and coordination; and (iv) reporting to \nDWD. The experience of the Executing Agency in participatory processes, the involvement of local \nNGOs, and the participation of all stakeholders will ensure transparency and good governance. \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $805,000 equivalent. The foreign exchange cost is \n$80,000. The local currency cost is $725,000 equivalent. The Government requested ADB to \nfinance $685,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $605,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund, administered by ADB. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $120,000, through providing counterpart and support staff and office \naccommodation, as well as other related services and facilities (Appendix 3).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.   The  TA\u2019s  implementation  will  be  completely  unified  with  the  GEEOW  Project\u2019s \nimplementation. The Executing Agency will be DWD of the Ministry of Women, Children, and \nSocial Welfare, and a DWD director will be the TA coordinator. DWD\u2019s director general will give \noverall guidance and oversee the implementation of all TA activities and ensure close coordination \nbetween these activities and those of the GEEOW Project. To enable the most disadvantaged \nhouseholds that graduate under the TA to participate in the GEEOW Project, the TA coordinator \nwill work closely with the project manager. This will be facilitated by the fact that WDOfs will be \nimplementing TA and project activities. DWD will provide staff and logistical support. Local NGOs \nand  community-based  organizations  focused  on  low-caste  and  ethnic  groups  will  be  crucial \nimplementing partners of WDOfs in (i) selecting beneficiaries, (ii) monitoring activities, and (iii) \nundertaking  capacity-building  activities.  The  NGOs  will  be  recruited  according  to  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. The selection criteria are listed in Appendix 4. The TA will be implemented \nover 24 months, from January 2006 to January 2008.11 Two implementation models will be piloted \nunder the TA: model A, in which WDOfs will be the social intermediaries, and model B, in which \nNGOs will be the social intermediaries. Lessons learned will be drawn from the most effective ways \nto reach the most disadvantaged households. ADB will finance equipment for the TA in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n16.  Armed conflict and political instability make the following strategic features necessary for \nTA implementation: (i) approach must be demand-driven and consistent with local development \npriorities; (ii) transparency regarding what the TA will deliver to local communities and within what \ntime frame must be ensured; (iii) affirmative action for low-caste and ethnic groups must be \nimplemented; (iv) implementation must be conducted through local institutions and people; (v) \nflexibility in implementation must be ensured; (vi) benefits that are visible must be delivered as \nquickly  as  possible,  especially  benefits  important  to  excluded  groups;  and  (vii)  approach  in \nplanning, decision making, budgeting, and monitoring must be fully participatory.12  \n   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $685,000 to the Government of \nNepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for Reaching \nthe Most Disadvantaged Groups in Mainstream Rural Development, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n                                                 \n11  Due to the closure of the Department for International Development Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in March \n2008, TA financial activities should be finished by December 2007. \n12  The conflict assessment appears in Appendix 3 of ADB. 2004.

The  Concept  of  the  Income  Generation  for  Vulnerable  Group  Development \nProgram of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee. The Income Generation for \nVulnerable Group Development (IGVGD) Program is built on a government safety net program \nthat provides free food grain for an 18-month period to destitute, female-headed households \nthat  are  at  the  highest  risk  of  hunger.  Through  its  experience,  the  Bangladesh  Rural \nAdvancement  Committee  (BRAC)  discovered  that  including  the  poorest  in  its  conventional \nmicrofinance operations was difficult, and BRAC was therefore looking for another entry point to \ninvolve the destitute in its development activities. BRAC understood that food grain donations \nprovided a strong incentive for the poorest to participate in programs. In the IGVGD Program, \nBRAC uses food grain relief assistance to attract the poorest and cater to their immediate \nconsumption needs, but skills training and savings and credit services are added, to build \ndevelopment capacity. Hence, when the cycle of free food grain ends, participants are able to \nengage in income-generating activities and become clients of regular microfinance programs, \nearning by way of their newly acquired skills at least the same money equivalent of the wheat \nthey received. The IGVGD Program started as a pilot activity in 1985 but since then has \nbecome a national program serving close to 1 million women.  \n3.  The Income Generation for Vulnerable Group Development Program Cycle. The \nIGVGD Program is jointly administered by the Government of Bangladesh and BRAC. The \nIGVGD Program has three essential elements: food grain safety net, skills training, and savings \nand credit services. Women entering the IGVGD Program as recipients of free food grain are \nselected by local elected representatives. This eliminates targeting costs for BRAC and protects \nit from the politics of selecting food grain recipients. The selection of households is based on \nthree criteria, households (i) headed by widows or abandoned women; (ii) owning less than half \nan acre of land; and (iii) earning less than 300 takas per month ($6.00). BRAC further selects ", "                    Appendix 2  11 \nabout 90% of the women receiving food relief for the IGVGD Program, excluding only the most \nphysically handicapped. Once selected for the IGVGD Program, participants begin training from \nan  available  menu  of  training  options,  including  poultry  and  livestock  raising,  vegetable \ngardening, and others. In most cases, training is completed 6 months after initial enrollment. \nWhen training is completed, participants are enrolled in a preexisting BRAC center. IGVGD \nProgram members attend weekly meetings and are required to save 25 takas ($0.50) per month \nwith BRAC.  \n4.  BRAC pays a 6% return on savings. Participants can save more frequently (weekly, for \nexample) if they choose to do this, as long as each month the 25 taka minimum is met. This \nrequirement is similar to the mandatory 20 taka ($0.40) savings per month for regular members. \nA first loan of 2,500 takas ($50.00) is disbursed on completion of training. Weekly repayments \nare due immediately. The interest charge is a flat rate of 15%. The loan term is 12 months. On \nrepayment of the initial loan, participants are given a second loan of 4,000 takas ($80.00). The \n18-month grain distribution cycle will typically end before the second loan is repaid. Upon \ncompletion  of  this  repayment,  IGVGD  Program  graduates  are  channeled  into  normal \nmicrofinance membership (BRAC\u2019s Rural Development Program). This is easier to do in cases \nwhere the household economic situation has improved. In practice, 80% of IGVGD Program \nmembers stay on for the next cycle, while about 66% stay on beyond two cycles.  \n \n5.  The Household Development Grant. The technical assistance delivery mechanism is \nsimilar to that of the Household Development Grant, as the grant uses the same two-step \napproach to poverty reduction: (i) livelihood protection, to reduce the vulnerability of the most \ndisadvantaged households, and (ii) livelihood promotion, to increase the incomes, productivity, \nor  employment  opportunities  of  these  households,  through  confidence  building  and  skills \ndevelopment. The following figure shows the two-step approach over time, adapted from the \nIGVGD Program. \n \nFigure A2: Poverty Reduction as a Two-Step Process of Livelihood Protection and \nLivelihood Promotion \nHousehold Income \nVersus \nConsumption \nUpper \nPoverty Line \nJoin GEEOW Project \n(Moderate Poor) \nConfidence  building Skills Training \nLower Poverty \nLine \n   (Poorest) \nHousehold \nDevelopment Grant \nGEEOW = Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women.  \nSource Adapted from the Income Generation for Vulnerable Group Development Program model of the Bangladesh \nRural Advancement Committee.  \n \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \nB.  Livelihood Approach to the Definition of Disadvantaged Groups \n \n6.  As a result of the process of profiling the rural population and its development and to \nbuild strategies toward the objective of reducing poverty in rural areas through strengthened \nhuman, social, capital, financial, and natural assets and empowerment, the population of rural \nNepal has been divided into four different groups: the most vulnerable, the vulnerable, the \nmedium  socioeconomic,  and  the  better-off  groups.  Two  concepts  have  been  used  to \ndifferentiate the groups and capture the previously mentioned assets and external factors in a \ndynamic development process: (i) dependency ratio, which is the number of potentially active \npeople in relation to the number of nonactive people in a household, and (ii) labor productivity, \nwhich is the capacity of economically active people to turn their labor into income.  \n \n7.  The most vulnerable1 groups (20\u201325% of the population), with high proportions of Dalit, \nTharu, Magar and Kamaiya, obtain more than 80% of their total incomes from wages. In \nprinciple, members of these groups are interested in working near their rural areas. In practice, \nmost of the adult men give priority to off-farm activities in district towns and in India, where the \nminimum wage is 2\u20133 times higher than farm wages in Nepal. Labor movement and migration \nstarted  in  the  mid-18th  century.  Other  sources  of  income,  including  second-choice  coping \nactivities, are quarrying, making bricks, collecting food and nonfood non timber forest product \nand credit from money lenders, begging, stealing, and trafficking children and child labor. In \nabsolute terms, vulnerable households are found among all castes and ethnic groups, with a \nsmaller proportion among Newar, Bhramin, and Chetri. All groups face low labor productivity \nand a high dependency ratio. The households in this category experience chronic food and \neconomic difficulties. New couples without inheritance and assistance, living in area with limited \npotential and facing some social difficulties, may take at least 14 years before starting to \nimprove their income and 18 years before constructing a permanent house. They will only then \nbe in a position to fully participate in development programs and begin accumulating financial \nand capital assets. During this 18-year period, given the low level of all types of assets, the \nhouseholds will not be in a position to take any risks.  \n \n8.  The  people  under  this  category  have  lost  or  have  never  had  any  sustainable  or \nadaptable production system in which they could at least ensure the reproduction of their \nsociety or household condition. The permanent fear of food insecurity impedes them to waste \ntheir time and energy on other activities that may be perceived by them as luxuries or maybe \nsuicide. Their survival strategy became a chronic way of life plagued by insecurity and less-\npreferred and sometimes socially unacceptable coping mechanisms, as well as lack of self-\nesteem and exclusion. Contrary to the poor, they need much more rehabilitation time and \nconfidence building before accepting any new development model that may provide additional \nthreats and risks. Conventional development delivery  mechanisms and project periods are \nusually not adapted to them, and they cannot afford to participate and benefit. Some projects try \nto fill temporarily the development inequity with social welfare or emergency activities, but most \nare not sustained, due to short periods, absence of consolidation activities, and exit strategies.  \n \n9.  Vulnerable groups (25\u201330% of the population) with a relatively high proportion of low-\ncaste and ethnic groups have less than 0.05 hectares per household member (an average of \n                                                 \n1 \u201cDisadvantaged\u201d in opposition to \u201cvery poor\u201d or \u201cultra poor,\u201d provides a dimension of chronic and permanent \nvulnerability to all kinds of shocks. The term includes the notions of \u201cpsychological poverty,\u201d \u201csocial exclusion,\u201d and \n\u201ctotal lack of hope for a better future.\u201d These notions are not automatically included in the standard interpretation of \n\u201cpoor, very poor, and ultra poor\u201d and therefore are often ignored or underestimated by development projects. \nHowever, psychological poverty and social exclusion continue to constrain disadvantaged groups\u2019 trust of and \nparticipation and interest in development programs. ", "                    Appendix 2  13 \n0.30 hectares per household) and base more than 60% of their total incomes on off-farm \nactivities. In absolute terms, an important number of high-caste households are also in this \ncategory. The food crops produced ensure 1\u20134 months of food security. Increased agriculture \nintensification,  diversification,  and  productivity  only  cover  part  of  the  food  gap  (through \nproduction or income to buy food). Vulnerable groups face low labor productivity and a medium \nto high dependency ratio. The households in this category have usually already financed a \npermanent house of low or medium quality through slow accumulation of funds or sale of buffalo \nand cattle. The labor force is sufficient to respond to profitable economic opportunities, either \nfarm (through an increase in cultivated area, to intensify existing farmland) or off-farm. Because \nvulnerable groups do not face much labor vulnerability and are in a position to improve their \nlabor productivity, they are motivated to change. A development program for capital and savings \nformation may potentially interest and benefit up to 85% of these groups. For others, changes \nare constrained by low capital and financial assets and sometimes lack of land.   \n \n10.  Medium socioeconomic groups (30\u201340% of the population) are usually food secured, \nwith their production system, and may slowly accumulate savings in favorable years. Medium-\nlevel socioeconomic groups have good labor productivity but a high dependency ratio, or a low \ndependency ratio but low labor productivity. Their well-being is maintained either through a well-\npaid household earner or through a high proportion of household labor force with a low level of \nearnings. Found in this category are large rural households with land and livestock, households \nwith  oversea  migrants  and  pension  earners,  and  households  that  are  involved  in  small \nbusinesses, trade, and microenterprises, with permanent employees. Savings are invested in \nimproved food, education, and housing. \n \n11.  The better-off households (10\u201315% of the population) enjoy a sustained accumulation \nstrategy, due to good labor productivity and a usually low dependency ratio. Many of those \nhouseholds are from a high caste and consolidate their capital, financial, human, and natural \nassets through their social and political networks. Most better-off households invest in higher \neducation.  They  do  not  face  particular  vulnerabilities,  except  recently,  because  of  the \ninsurgency.  \n \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The general selection criteria will be the following: \n(i)  more than 50% of the population is income poor; \n(ii)  more than 60% of the population has less than 0.5 hectares of agricultural land; \n(iii)  more than 40% of the population is Dalit and low-caste or ethnic minority; \n(iv)  no  other  agencies  are  implementing  the  same  activities  in  the  area,  but \npartnership for implementation with other programs is possible; and \n(v)  other  cluster-  and  district-specific  selection  criteria  will  be  elaborated  by  the \ndistrict  project  teams,  district  implementation  coordination  committees,  and \ncentral project management team. \n \nB.  Selecting Households \n3.    The  following  basic  selection  criteria  will  be  used  for  communities,  to  successfully \nidentify very poor households.    \n(i)  Household has less than 3 months of food security from production.  \n(ii)  Wage from seasonal employment and migration to India is the main source of \nhousehold cash income. \n(iii)  Household owns no land or less than 0.3 hectares of land.  \n(iv)  Household labor productivity is low, and the socioeconomic situation cannot be \nimproved. \n(v)  Literacy  level;  awareness  of  development  issues;  skill  levels;  and  capital, \nfinancial and social asset levels are low. \n(vi)  Household dependency rate is high. \n(vii)  Household faces caste-based discrimination and social isolation. \n(viii)  Household needs to rely on credit from local moneylenders and from small jobs \nto ensure the feeding of family members during the lean months.   \n(ix)  Members of the household, because of their workload and vulnerability, have no \ntime for community-based activities or collective action to raise their voices.  \n \nC.  Selecting Nongovernment Organizations and Community-Based Organizations  \n4.  Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be recruited to implement various activities of \nthe TA.
