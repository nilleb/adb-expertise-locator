The Project will support the implementation of a sewerage system development project \n(SSDP)  in  Banda  Aceh,  Bekasi  and  Mataram.  The  project  supports  (i)  rehabilitation  and \nconstruction of offsite and on-site systems, (ii) establishment of effective service delivery system, \nand (iii) the implementation of public awareness campaigns.  \n \n2.  The objective of the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is to design the \nSSDP focusing on the following outputs: (i) confirm recommended policy actions and identify the \nsupport that may be provided through the loan; (ii) design a result based component of the loan \nthat  can  support:  infrastructure  development;  policy,  legal  and  institutional  reforms;  and \nleverage local government spending in sanitation; (iii) develop public awareness campaigns on \nhygiene promotion and sanitation; (iv) assessment of  climate risk vulnerability and identify \nadaptation  and  mitigation  options,  (v)  confirmation  of  the  overall  Project\u2019s  financial  and \neconomic viability, and (v) confirmation of safeguard documents. \n \n3.  The feasibility studies of the infrastructure investments (output 1 of the project design) \nwill be prepared by a consultant firm recruited trough Cities Development Initiative Asia (CDIA). \nThe terms of reference will be prepared in consultation with the project cities. The consultants\u2019 \nactivities will include, but are not limited to: (i) review of existing studies, reports, data, and \nrelated information; (ii) conduct primary surveys, if needed; (iii) confirm the long and mid-term \nwaste water management strategy and targets; (iv) describe, map, and quantify the condition of \nwaste water management system in the project cities; (v) review the institutional and regulatory \narrangements, operation and maintenance of the waste water management system; (vi) identify \nrelated issues and prepare recommendations for strengthening the same under the capacity \ndevelopment component of the project, and; (vii) prepare a feasibility study that includes a \nreview  of  alternative  processes,  construction  methods  and/or  designs  to  be  used  for  the \ninfrastructure, followed by a selection of most appropriate process, method and/or design based \non performance based specification. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n4.  Confirmation of recommended policy actions: the recently Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) funded Wastewater Management Investment Roadmap (May 2016) lists a number of \nnational and local government policy actions. Also, the Ministry of Home Affairs is currently \ndrafting regulations specifically on three issues related to sanitation for local government, which \nare  (i)  accelerated  sanitation,  (ii)  asset  transfer  and  (iii)  sanitation  service  provider.  This \nministerial  regulation  will  identify  possible  organization  forms  and  provide  guidelines  for \narranging important aspects of sanitation management.  \n \n5.  Following  a  review  of  these  actions  and  regulations,  the  consultant  is  expected  to \npropose the support required by the project to implement these actions ad regulations. \n \n6.  Design  of  an  output  based  financing  component:  The  output  based  financing \ncomponent of the project aims to finance the community based systems and/or eliminating open \ndefecation through a community led total sanitation program for which implementation and \nmonitoring have been developed and tested under two government programs: PNPM Mandiri-\nSANIMAS Program and Sanitasi Total Berbasis Masyarakat (STBM). \n \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n7.  The output linked indicators may refer to relevant policy, institutional, planning and \nbudgetary  reforms,  focused  at  mainstreaming  City  Sanitation  Strategies  (CSS)  into  formal \nplanning and budgeting processes and leverage of local government funding of sanitation, \n \n8.  The consultant is expected to carry out the following assessments: \n(i)  assess  program  soundness  covering  relevance  and  justification,  adequacy, \nimplementation arrangements, financial and economic analysis; \n(ii)  identify outputs to be linked to disbursements (indicators) and verification protocol;  \n(iii)  develop expenditure framework and financing plan, to determine the degree to \nwhich the proposed output based financing program will achieve its development \nresults; \n(iv)  examine  the  program  systems  (monitoring  and  evaluation,  fiduciary  [financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption],  safeguards  [environmental  and \nsocial], social inclusion and gender, and other systemic and institutional aspects).  \n \n9.  Design of effective service delivery mechanisms: Based on a sound legal framework, \na single, financially independent public service organization needs to be proposed which is \nresponsible for planning, implementing, operating and maintaining wastewater management \nsystems,  with  adequate  capacity  and  increased  accountability,  financial  and  operational \nresponsibility and transparency. Sanitation planning, financing, budgeting and capacity building \nstrategies need to streamlined into local government planning and budgeting cycles. The roles \nof sub-national agencies in effective service delivery need to be assessed and confirmed and/or \nredefined. \n \n10.  The consultant is expected to identify delivery mechanisms, including but not limited to \noutsourcing  to  private  sector  (performance  based  contracts,  build  and  operate  contracts, \nmanagement  contracts),  co-management  (communities  and  local  government)  and  social \ncontracts. \n \n11.  Design  of  social  marketing  strategies:  Starting  with  stakeholder  analysis  and \ndevelopment of a stakeholder communication strategy and participation plan, support for the \nproject by the various stakeholders will be ensured.  Supported by a gender analysis and a \ngender action plan, the consultant is expected develop public awareness campaigns on hygiene \npromotion  and  sanitation  (aimed  at  various  steps  of  the  \u2018sanitation  ladder\u201d),  including \nCommunity-Led  Total  Sanitation  programs.  This  development  should  be  based  on  an \nassessment and adaptation of existing programs in Indonesia. \n \n12.  Screening and assessment of climate risk and vulnerability of the investments: \nBased on the assessment, adaptation options are identified and evaluated on the basis of their \ntechnical feasibility and financial and economic viability. Climate mitigation measures will be \nidentified,  focusing  on  reducing  Green  House  Gas  emission  through  energy  efficiency \nimprovement. Community based climate resilience activities need to be identified. \n \n13.  Assessment of social impacts: The consultant is expected to assess: (i) poverty and \nsocial impact; (ii) gender impact, (iii) participation dimensions (including affordability analysis); \n(iv) social safeguards; and (v) other social risks; and develop relevant strategies and action \nplans (such as Gender Action Plan).  \n \n14.  Confirmation of the overall Project\u2019s financial and economic viability. Based on the \nfinancial and economic viability of the infrastructure, prepared under output 1 of the project \ndesign, the consultants will confirm the project\u2019s overall Project\u2019s financial and economic viability, \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n \nbased on ADB\u2019s identified 10 key areas of economic analysis: Assess the Macroeconomic \nContext; Assess the Sector Context; Assess the Demand; Provide the Economic Rationale and \nChoice of Financing Modality; Establish a Project Design and Monitoring Framework; Identify \nProject Alternatives and Conduct the Least-Cost Analysis; Identify and Compare Benefits and \nCosts;  Assess  the  Sustainability  of  the  Project  Investment;  Perform  Sensitivity  and  Risk \nAnalysis;  Perform  Distribution  Analysis  (Key  Areas  of  Economic  Analysis  of  Investment \nProjects\u2013An Overview [2013]).  \n \n15.
