INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to improve energy efficiency, \nemission control, and compliance management of the manufacturing industry.1 A TA fact-finding \nmission on 25 March 2014 reached an agreement with the government on the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financial arrangements, and terms of reference \nfor the consulting services of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC began to reform state-owned enterprises in 1978. Initially, the emphasis was \non gradually transforming state-owned enterprises\u2019 operational and management system from a \nplanned economy to a market economy. For instance, the government gradually reduced fiscal \nsupport  for  the  working  capital  of  state-owned  enterprises.  Since  the  mid-1990s,  more \nsubstantial  reforms  have  been  implemented,  including  divestment  of  state  shares  and \ncorporatization. Legal and regulatory frameworks were also established. The Company Law \nwas promulgated in 1993, providing the legal basis for an enterprise system in the market \neconomy.  The  amended  Company  Law  (2006)  strengthened  the  legal  basis  for  improving \ncorporate governance in the PRC, while the Cleaner Production Law (2003) and the amended \nEnergy Conservation Law (2008) became effective to improve efficiency in energy consumption. \n \n3.  Thanks to the reform measures and an abundant labor force, the PRC\u2019s manufacturing \nindustry achieved remarkable growth, and the PRC became \u201cthe factory of the world.\u201d3 However, \nthree decades after the reforms began, the manufacturing industry still competes on low factor \n(e.g., labor and capital) prices and less regard to environment concerns. The manufacturing \nindustry is still characterized by the large volume of low- to medium-quality products with high \nenergy consumption and high emission. The manufacturing industry generally lacks proper \ntechnological  and  management  capacities  for  producing  energy  efficient  and  low  emission \nproducts. Given that the manufacturing industry accounts for more than 60% of total value \nadded in the PRC industry, this has caused serious problems in the PRC, such as high energy \nintensity and carbon dioxide (CO ) emission.4 In fact, energy consumption has increased rapidly \n2\nin the PRC, more than doubling in the past decade.5 The industry sector in particular accounts \nfor more than 70% of the country\u2019s total energy consumption.6 In addition, the PRC overtook the \nUnited States of America in 2007 as the world\u2019s largest annual emitter of energy-related CO , \n2\nand its annual CO  emissions reached 7 billion tons in 2009, which amounts to about 24% of \n2\nglobal emissions. Such a rapid increase in energy consumption and CO emissions raises \n2 \nconcern about the sustainability of economic development in the PRC.7  \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan. ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 August 2014. \n3  The classification of the manufacturing industry is based on the standard industrial classification.  \n    https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sicsearch.html \n4  Energy intensity is defined as the cost of converting energy into a product. High energy intensity indicates that high \nenergy consumption is needed to produce a product. \n5  Total energy consumption increased to 3,480,020,000 tons of standard coal equivalent in 2011 from 1,455,310,000 \ntons of standard coal equivalent in 2000.  \n6  China Statistical Bureau. 2013. China Statistical Yearbook 2013. Beijing. \n7  Energy consumption per value added in the manufacturing industry was 1.6 in 2009, 1.4 in 2010, and 1.3 in 2011. \nThis  indicator  is  calculated  based  on  the  data  from  China  Statistical  Yearbook. \nhttp://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2013/indexch.htm \n ", "2   \n \n \n4.  Bottlenecks  of  the  PRC\u2019s  manufacturing  industry  are  outdated  technologies  and \nequipment, and inadequate operational management, particularly with regard to compliance \nwith policies and regulations, such as the Cleaner Production Law and the amended Energy \nConservation Law. It is necessary for the PRC\u2019s manufacturing industry to invest more in \nresearch and development of advanced technologies and related equipment to improve energy \nefficiency  and  emission  control.  Compliance  management  is  also  important  for  the  PRC\u2019s \nmanufacturing  industry  to  ensure  business  operations  align  with  existing  regulations  and \nlegislations, including managing environmental requirements. Clearly, there is a need for the \nmanufacturing industry to transform itself to produce high quality products manufactured under \nenergy efficient and low emission standards. \n \n5.  To transform the development pattern of the manufacturing industry, proper incentives \nfor  complying  with  relevant  regulations  are  critically  lacking  in  the  PRC.  The  PRC\u2019s \nmanufacturing industry produces basic equipment for other industries as well as consumer \nproducts. Therefore, upgrading technologies, equipment and compliance management in the \nPRC\u2019s manufacturing industry would lead to improving energy efficiency and emission control \nnot only in its own economy but also in the global economy. Upgrading the technologies would \nalso be consistent with the PRC\u2019s efforts on enhancing competitiveness of the manufacturing \nindustry through technological advancement since energy efficiency and emission control are \ncritical concerns in the global economy. \n \n6.  Environmentally  sustainable  growth  is  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC.8 The  government  has  placed  environmental \nissues  on  top  of  the  reform  agenda,  and  highlighted  the  importance  of  improving  energy \nefficiency and establishing environment protection systems at the Third Plenary Session of the \n18th  Central  Committee  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  in  November  2013.  The \nmanufacturing industry is a key player in improving energy efficiency and energy conservation in \nthe PRC. It is necessary to improve its capacities to achieve environmentally sustainable growth \nin the PRC. \n \n7.  In line with the government\u2019s initiatives, previous ADB TA helped enhance the enterprise \nperformance  evaluation  system  and  improve  corporate  governance  including  compliance \nmanagement in the PRC.9 ADB also supported the development of carbon trade and financing \nmechanisms for energy efficiency and emission reduction in the PRC, particularly financing to \nimprove the energy efficiency of small- and medium-sized enterprises.10 In addition, ongoing TA \nhelps the PRC transform its industrial structure, including not only the manufacturing industry \n                                                \n8   ADB. 2012.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be improved energy efficiency in the PRC\u2019s manufacturing industry. This \nwill  be  measured  by  the  reduction  in  energy  consumption  and  CO   emissions  per  gross \n2\ndomestic  product.  The  outcome  will  be  an  enhanced  policy  framework  stimulating  energy \nefficient and low emission products. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.    The proposed TA will deliver four major outputs: \n(i)  Report  on  current  status  of  the  PRC\u2019s  manufacturing  industry,  including \nevaluation of past policies. \n(ii)  Report on field case studies of major bottlenecks of enterprises in the PRC\u2019s \nmanufacturing industry.12 \n(iii)  A  synthesis  paper  (knowledge  product),  including  policy  lessons  and \nrecommendations. \n(iv)  Capacity development of government officials, enterprise managers, and other \nstakeholders. \n \n10.   Specifically, each of the first three outputs will conduct following activities: (i) output 1 will \nanalyze the current status of the PRC\u2019s manufacturing industry in terms of energy efficiency, \nemission reduction, and compliance management. It will also analyze the current status of \nstrategic resource management such as management of capital and human resources, and \nassess the effectiveness of relevant past policies in the PRC; (ii) based on the field case \nstudies, output 2 will examine major bottlenecks that keep enterprises in the manufacturing \nindustry  from  upgrading  their  capacities  for  energy  efficiency,  emission  reduction,  and \ncompliance management; (iii) a synthesis paper will analyze international good practice in \nstrengthening  technological  and  equipment  capacity  and  compliance  management,  and \nchallenges in the PRC\u2019s manufacturing industry to improving its energy efficiency, and emission \nreduction. It will also analyze how international practice can be adequately applied to the PRC\u2019s \nmanufacturing industry. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $370,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  translation  of \nnecessary  official  documents  to  English,  assistance  in  arranging  meetings  with  relevant \nagencies, and other in-kind contributions. \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2014.
