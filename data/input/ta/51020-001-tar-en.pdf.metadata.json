THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \nA.  Justification \n1.  Introduction. The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide \nproject preparation and capacity building support to three ensuing projects, comprising (i) Yunnan \nLincang Border Economic Cooperation Zone Infrastructure Comprehensive Development Project, \n(ii) multitranche financing facility (MFF) and Tranche 1 for Xinjiang Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Promotion Investment Program, and (iii) MFF and Tranche 1 for Inner Mongolia \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Promotion Investment Program. The ensuing projects will \nsupport the efforts of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) toward stronger participation in \nregional cooperation and integration (RCI), notably the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) programs. The transaction TA is listed \nin the country operations business plan 2017\u20132019 for the PRC.1 \n \n2.   Government\u2019s Strategy. RCI is an important part of the PRC\u2019s national development \nstrategies. The Thirteenth Five Year Plan (FYP) for National Economic and Social Development \nwhich covers the period of 2016\u20132020 committed the PRC to \u201cbreak new grounds for opening up, \nbuild mutual trust with partners, promote investment and trade cooperation, enhance people-to-\npeople exchanges, and achieve win-win results through deepening of regional cooperation and \nintegration\u201d.2 The Thirteenth FYP attaches special importance to development and opening-up of \nthe border areas, particularly Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR), Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (IMAR), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and Yunnan Province. \nAccording to the Plan, GZAR will serve as the gateway to the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations; Yunnan will build itself into the PRC\u2019s center for pivoting to South and Southeast Asia; \nXUAR will become the PRC\u2019s window for opening-up to Central and West Asia; and IMAR will be \na hub for cooperation with Mongolia and the broader Northeast Asia region (footnote 2).  The four \nborder provinces are also active participants of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-coordinated \nRCI initiatives\u2014GZAR and Yunnan are part of the GMS program, and IMAR and XUAR are \nmembers of the CAREC program, and they have also mainstreamed RCI into their respective \ndevelopment strategies, notably their provincial-level Thirteenth FYP.  \n \n3.  ADB strategy and performance. RCI is a prominent theme and a core area of operations \nof ADB's Long-Term Strategic Framework, or Strategy 2020 and its Midterm Review. In line with \nthis strategic framework, ADB will increase its RCI-related assistance to at least 30% of its total \noperations by 2020. ADB\u2019s new Operational Plan for RCI puts special emphasis on promoting \nconnectivity,  competitiveness,  and  regional  public  goods.3 RCI  is  an  integral  part  of  ADB \noperations in the PRC. All the country partnership strategy (CPS) documents since 2004 have \nhighlighted the importance of RCI for the PRC, especially for development of its border provinces. \nRCI was one of the five strategic priorities of the CPS 2016\u20132020 for the PRC.4 For the current \nCPS period, the regional orientation of the country program has been further strengthened to \ncomplement ADB\u2019s support for the CAREC and GMS programs. ADB works closely with the \ngovernment to support RCI through country projects and TA. As of 31 December 2016, ADB\u2019s \nlending to the PRC in support of the GMS and CAREC programs comprised 27 projects totaling \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

The other strategic priorities are managing climate change and the environment, supporting inclusive \neconomic growth, fostering knowledge cooperation, and supporting institutional and governance reform.  \n ", "2 \n$4.45  billion,  focusing  on  transport  (road,  railway,  and  port)  networks,  infrastructure  and \nenvironment  improvement  in  border  and  corridor  cities/towns,  border  economic  zone \ndevelopment, improvement of border crossing points, and development of small and medium-\nsized enterprises in border areas of the provinces and autonomous regions involved in regional \ncooperation. During the period of 2017\u20132019, six investment projects are planned under the broad \nframework of GMS and CAREC.5 These projects will help further enhance the PRC's physical \nconnectivity and trade and investment links with its neighboring countries and support economic \ncorridor development. \n \n4.  In 2016, ADB processed an MFF and the first tranche for Guangxi Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Investment to support GZAR\u2019s participation in regional cooperation, particularly \nthe GMS program.6 The investment program adopted a holistic approach to address the wide \nrange of challenges GZAR faces in regional cooperation. The project was also intended to serve \nas a model for designing future investment projects in other border provinces participating in the \nRCI programs. At the National Consultation and Knowledge Sharing Workshop on Regional \nCooperation and Integration, jointly organized by ADB and the PRC government on 25\u201326 May \n2017 in IMAR, representatives of IMAR, XUAR, and Yunnan expressed strong interest in GZAR\u2019s \nexperience in designing and implementing RCI projects.  \n \n5.   Problems and Opportunities. Like GZAR, IMAR, XUAR, and Yunnan also face a series \nof constraints in implementing RCI programs, particularly in developing border areas and cross-\nborder economic corridors. Main constraints include: (i) poor infrastructure for connectivity, \nespecially at key border crossing points which serve as the main conduit for cross-border \nmovement of goods and people; (ii) lack of well-developed industrial parks or border economic \nzones to serve as engines for local economic development by attracting investment and fostering \nenterprise clusters; (iii) low-level urban infrastructure (such as water supply, sewage and waste \ntreatment, and power and heating) in border towns which are often key nodes in cross-border \neconomic corridors; (iv) poor social infrastructure (especially schools and hospitals) to meet the \nrising demand from across the borders for educational and health services; (v) low level of \nsimplification and harmonization of border clearance procedures, especially those related to \ncustoms inspection and sanitary and phytosanitary services; and (vi) low level of private sector \nparticipation in cross-border trade and investment activities.  \n \n6.   The Government of the PRC has requested ADB\u2019s assistance to IMAR, XUAR, and \nYunnan to strengthen their participation in the RCI programs. The values ADB is expected to \ncontribute include (i) long term financing which is still lacking in those relatively poorer border \nprovinces; (ii) RCI knowledge and experience from other parts of the country and rest of Asia, \nincluding innovative financing modalities for RCI operations; (iii) advice on sharpening RCI \ndimension and maximizing regional benefits of the investment projects; and (iv) opportunities for \ncross-border dialogues and coordinated actions. The list and brief descriptions of the ensuing \nprojects to be supported by this transaction TA are in Table 1. The ensuing projects will have high \npositive  RCI  spillovers,  also  benefiting  neighboring  countries  mainly  through  (i)  improved \nconnectivity and trade facilitation which will provide better access for neighboring countries to \n                                                \n5  In addition to the three ensuing projects to be supported by the transactional TA, the country operations business \nplan 2017\u20132019 for PRC also includes another three projects with strong RCI dimensions, including the second and \nthe third tranche of the Guangxi Regional Cooperation and Integration Promotion Investment Program, and the \nSubregional Rail Link (Yuxi\u2013Mohan).  \n6  ADB. 2016.
