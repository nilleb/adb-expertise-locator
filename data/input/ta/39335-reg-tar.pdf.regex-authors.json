The  2006  technical  assistance  (TA)  program  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) includes a regional TA to help developing member countries \n(DMCs) promote sustainable urban transport development.1 DMCs\u2019 demand for knowledge in \nthis area is high, and the issue is extremely relevant to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) \ncurrent and future operations, therefore this TA responds both to DMCs\u2019 demands and ADB\u2019s \noperational needs. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  As cities grow exponentially, an effective and sustainable urban transport system for \npeople and goods is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth. However, urban transport \nsystems in most cities are underdeveloped and their transport capacity is insufficient. Thus \nresidents are unable to fully exploit economic opportunities and lack the mobility needed to \nsupport economic growth.  \n \n3.  Urban transport systems in most cities suffer from such major constraints as insufficient \nfinancial resources, inefficient regulatory frameworks, poor allocation of road space, inadequate \ntraffic management systems, institutional weaknesses, and underdeveloped public transport \nsystems. Current urban transport systems also rarely integrate social concerns and the specific \nneeds of vulnerable groups, thereby rendering such systems ineffective in relation to poverty \nreduction. Drastic increases in the number of vehicles have strained urban road networks, \nresulting in congestion for much of the day. Most of these factors disproportionately affect the \nurban poor in terms of limited access to affordable transport services, ill-health from pollution, \nand road safety concerns. \n \n4.  In most cities, road networks developed in an unplanned, ad hoc fashion, and without \nproper adherence to quality standards, are severely deficient in meeting developmental demand. \nResidential areas have few and inadequate tertiary or access roads and limited provisions for \npedestrians, cyclists, and parked vehicles. In addition, road networks often have missing links, \nforcing the overuse of existing road sections, and the lack of circumferential roads results in \ncongestion from through traffic. Meanwhile, increases in the number and uses of vehicles \nsurpass the capacity of road space, adding to congestion and air pollution. As a result, transport \nconditions  in  cities  are  characterized  by  severe  congestion  and  aggravated  by  the  poor \ndiscipline among drivers, the incoherent enforcement of traffic laws, and an eclectic mix of \nvehicles. A failure to respond promptly to rapid motorization and the resultant congestion, along \nwith  weak  enforcement  of  vehicle  emissions  standards,  results  in  degradation  of  the \nenvironment and stunts cities\u2019 growth potential.2 \n \n5.  Swift urbanization has also increased the number of urban poor. Efficient transport \nsystems contribute to urban economic growth, thereby raising incomes and decreasing urban \npoverty. However, current urban transport systems, which do not fully integrate the specific \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 February 2006. \n2  Vehicle-generated air pollution is among the serious environmental problems adversely affecting the health of city \nresidents, especially the poor. The economic costs\u2014loss of productivity and failing health\u2014of the resultant local air \npollution in the urban areas of DMCs are significant, sometimes as large as 5% of gross domestic product. (World \nBank.  2002. Cities on the Move. Urban Transport Strategy Review. Washington, DC)  \n ", "2   \nneeds  of  the  poor,  have  worsened  the  perverse  distributional  effects  of  urbanization.3 \nOverstrained public transport systems restrict urban residents, particularly the urban poor, from \nactively participating in economic activities. The social exclusion engendered by urban transport \nmakes it more difficult for the disabled to access to jobs and services. As a result, the poor find \nit hard to break out of poverty. In addition, the poor are disproportionately exposed to the risks \nassociated with transport externalities, for example, they lack the means to avoid exposure to \npolluted air. Moreover, the risks they face when they travel are higher than those of the non-\npoor because of the few safety provisions for pedestrians and cyclists at street crossings and \nthe  slack  enforcement  of  pedestrian  crossing  facilities.  Thus  urban  transport  policies  and \nprograms should take the needs of the poor into account.   \n \n6.  Poor traffic management, one of the biggest issues in many cities, is a combination of \nmany factors: lack of coordination and overlapping responsibilities among various agencies, \ninsufficient traffic police and traffic signals, flaws in traffic markings, and ineffective enforcement \nof traffic rules and regulations. Accidents are common due to poor traffic management on one \nhand and undisciplined pedestrians and the many types of vehicles using the roads on the other. \nPoor traffic management has also resulted in encroachment by parked vehicles and commercial \nactivity on roads, thereby reducing road capacity, and causing inadequate public transport \nservices. Good traffic management can not only improve the flow of traffic, but can reduce \nnegative environmental impacts. The need for efficient traffic management systems is therefore \nacute. Such systems will require (i) an appropriate transport policy framework under which \ngovernments can manage travel demand; and (ii) strategic plans that cover junction operations, \nenforcement, road use, driver re-education, public transport, parking, traffic signals, vehicle \nrestrictions and circulation plans, pavement markings, vehicle condition, and equitable allocation \nof road space. \n \n7.  While a large portion of the urban population relies heavily on public transport for its \ndaily activities, public transport systems in most cities are not yet adequately developed and \ninvestments have been limited. Bus and paratransit services, the predominant public transport \nservices, are often exclusively operated by the private sector (e.g., as in Colombo, Dhaka, and \nKathmandu).  The  unregulated  operation  of  private  buses,  particularly  with  regard  to  the \nallocation of routes and schedules, has spawned excessive competition, and as a result, the \nfinancial performance of public transport and the quality of service have deteriorated, negating \nthe benefits derived from investments in road construction. Improving the efficiency of public \ntransport should not only lower costs, but a flexible framework, which makes public transport \nmore  accessible  to  the  poor.  To  this  end,  solid  institutional  and  regulatory  structures  are \nrequired that will help create efficient public transport systems that poor users  can afford and \nthat give incentives for proper maintenance, investment, and service expansion. \n \n8.  Governments\u2019 weak capacities lead to low institutional coordination and an inefficient \ninstitutional  framework.  Government  agencies  have  overlapping  or  poorly  delineated \nresponsibilities,4 planning and programming are chronically fragmented and largely ad hoc, and \ninstitutional arrangements for policy implementation are usually incoherent. Rapidly increasing \nurban  populations  require  the  efficient  use  of  limited  land  resources  to  support  economic \ngrowth; however, planning for land use, urban development  and transport management is \n                                                 \n3  As cities expand, the price of land that is more accessible to the city center rises. Poor people are forced to live on \nless expensive land, either in inner city slums or on distant city peripheries. Sprawling cities make the journey to \nwork excessively long and costly for the poor. \n4 There is ambiguity regarding the role played by planning, programming, implementation, and operations in transport \ninfrastructure and services. The structure is disjointed in that those responsible for planning and policymaking are \noften not those who implement or operate urban transport facilities and services. \n ", "  3\nloosely integrated, thereby constraining cities\u2019 growth potential, competitiveness, and efficiency.  \nOverall,  few  cities  are  well  organized  and  possess  competent  traffic  management  units. \nCoherent  and  integrated  plans  and  operations  under  a  wider,  more  holistic  approach  to \ntransport planning, programming,  and operation are critical for an efficient urban transport \nsystem, and capacity to this end must therefore be developed. \n \n9.  Private sector involvement in urban transport is generally limited to the provision of \npublic transport services, including buses, taxis, and trucks.5 Despite growing recognition of the \nburden that investments in major roads and subways place on municipal budgets, private sector \nparticipation in maintenance or construction is still rare. Public mass transit systems require \nsubstantial investment and careful commercial management to ensure their financial viability, for \nwhich private sector involvement is crucial, particularly in big cities. Planning and regulatory \narrangements for private participation in urban transport must therefore be established. \n \n10.  The World Bank and several bilateral institutions are actively involved in urban transport \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  the  region.  The  studies  and  activities  undertaken  by  these \norganizations are expected to promote a good grasp of best practices, issues, and constraints in \nrelation to urban transport. Close cooperation with other donors is important to generate a well-\ndesigned plan and coordinated programming. \n \n11.  Experience  indicates  that  piecemeal  approaches  to  sustainable  urban  transport \ndevelopment are likely to fail and that capital investments need to be supported by policy, legal, \nregulatory, and institutional reforms; capacity building; and innovative financing mechanisms \nthat facilitate the provision of sustainable, high-quality transport infrastructure and services. \nMore  policy  attention  must  also  be  focused  on  building  capacity  in  urban  transport \nadministration, on enhancing the role and quality of affordable public transport, on financing \nmechanisms, and on the needs of pedestrians and of users of nonmotorized transport. \n \n12.  Efficiency increases once institutional reforms strengthen the capacities of governments \nto manage the framework for transport more efficiently and enhance their capacities to provide \ncustomer-responsive  services.  Meanwhile,  outdated  administrative  structures  are  serious \nobstacles to better operational efficiency, as these have no criteria by which to judge agency \naccountability. Agencies must free up budgetary resources to introduce sound plans, operating \nsystems, and technologies. Adopting modern management systems can also increase capacity \neven without capital-intensive investment. \n \n13.  Inexpensive  access  to  income-generating  opportunities  is  an  important  means  for \nhelping the urban poor up the economic ladder. Thus key social and environmental concerns \nhave to be integrated into transport planning to ensure that the resultant benefits accrue to the \npoor. Inclusive transport systems require the removal of institutional and physical barriers and \nthe enhancement of incentives that increase access to transport services by diverse individuals \nand groups.  \n \n14.  Thus most Asian cities urgently need to establish a strategic development framework \nthat  will  link  urban  transport,  effective  environmental  management,  and  inclusive  social \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The framework will require building strong institutional \ncapacities to improve traffic regulations and their enforcement; introduce integrated planning \nand  programming;  and  promote  sustainable  transport  schemes  based  on  affordable, \n                                                 \n5  In Colombo, 90% of bus operations are privately run, while paratransit services (three-wheelers). Three-wheeled \nrickshaws are exclusively owned and operated by the private sector. \n ", "4   \nenvironmentally-friendly, motorized and nonmotorized transport. To develop such a framework, \nan analysis of the policies and regulations that govern transport markets in specific jurisdictions \nwill first have to be carried out, as the effectiveness of user markets is instrumental in reaping \nthe benefits of transport infrastructure. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The TA aims to promote urban economic development by developing sustainable urban \ntransport  systems.  The  TA  will  provide  each  of  the  selected  areas  with  (i)  a  strategic \ndevelopment  framework  for  sustainable  urban  transport;  (ii)  a  set  of  effective  investment \nprograms to support efficient urban transport systems; and (iii) a set of innovative financing \noptions, such as combining public and private resources and using new financing modalities. \nThe TA will provide outcomes that are relevant and readily applicable to ADB\u2019s operational \nprogramming. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will (i) undertake a field study for each of the selected cities, taking into account \nprevious studies and activities by their governments, ADB, the World Bank, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and other donors; and \n(ii) hold extensive consultations with national and municipal governments, local stakeholders, \nand other donors. For the field studies, the TA will include Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.6 \n \n17.  The strategic development framework will concentrate on (i) institutional capacities for \npolicy, planning, and programming; (ii) adequate allocation and operation of road space; (iii) \nefficient traffic management, enforcement, and regulation; (iv) energy-efficient, environmentally-\nfriendly urban transport to reduce vehicle emissions; (v) urban transport safety; (vi) sectoral \nreforms pertaining to public transport, management and maintenance, and institutions; (vii) good \ngovernance; and (viii) inclusion of the special needs of the urban poor and of others without \nready access to transport services in planning and programming.  \n \n18.  Coherent investment programs will be designed for each of the cities that will pay \nparticular  attention  to  future  investment,  which  will  add  a  regional  dimension  to  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment portfolio in urban transport. Potential projects may be modern traffic management \nsystems, including road user charge systems, and affordable transit systems, such as bus rapid \ntransport and light rail transit. The TA will first conduct diagnostic analyses to identify the most \nurgent projects, which must be environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. The \nfinal outputs of the TA will serve, individually or packaged, as a basis for interventions in urban \ntransport by the regional departments. The TA will propose specific financing arrangements for \nproject implementation, including combining public\u2013private partnerships in one package and \nexploring new financing modalities. \n \n19.  The TA will build on recent, related ADB work. It will also coordinate with related ongoing \nactivities in ADB, including the forthcoming urban sector strategy and the clean air initiative. The \noutput of the TA will enhance ADB\u2019s ability to engage in policy dialogue with the selected DMCs \n                                                 \n6  A number of consultations with regional departments were undertaken when selecting the countries. During TA \npreparation, Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Colombo (Sri Lanka) were identified as pilot cities. For \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and Pakistan, cities will be selected during implementation. \n ", "  5\nand deliver lending and TA in some key areas of its operations. Furthermore, as the analytical \nwork  will  include  reviews  of  successful  regional  and  global  experiences  while  suggesting \npossible future directions in the Asian context, the TA will help improve the efficiency of roads, \nvehicles, public transport operations, traffic management, and urban transport in general. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 and will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. RSDD will be responsible for overall and \nday-to-day monitoring of TA activities, including supervising and coordinating the consultants\u2019 \nwork. The TA will involve ADB-wide collaboration with the transport community of practice, \nregional departments and their transport and communications divisions, resident missions in the \nfive selected countries, and the Private Sector Operations Department. The TA implementation \nteam will comprise a team leader from RSDD and staff selected from within ADB. The team will \nbe supported by international and national consultants. Overall supervision and guidance will be \nprovided by a task force chaired by the team leader and composed of representatives from the \ndepartments  concerned.  The  fielding  of  consultants  is  scheduled  for  November  2007  and \nconsulting  services  will  be  carried  out  over  18  months  for  completion  in  April  2008.  The \nconsultants will procure equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \n22.  The TA will require a total of 93 person-months of consulting services, including 23 \nperson-months for individual international consultants, 10 person-months for individual national \nconsultants,  and  60  person-months  for  national  institute  consultants.  Appendix  3  presents \noutline terms of reference.7 The international consultants will provide expertise in (i) urban \ntransport, with specialties in transport policy, planning, traffic management, and public transport; \n(ii) urban development, with a specialty in capacity building; (iii) poverty and social development; \nand (iv) financial management and private sector participation. The consultants will be engaged \nby ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n23.  The TA implementation team will collaborate closely and consult regularly with ADB \nregional departments and relevant networks. As appropriate, the team will organize discussions, \nworkshops, and seminars to assess findings from the viewpoint of operational needs. The \noutputs of the TA will be compiled as a knowledge product and will ultimately be integrated into \ncountry partnership strategies. The findings of the TA will be widely disseminated through \nvarious modalities, including publication, country workshops, and seminars. The TA\u2019s outcome \nshould be evaluated bearing in mind ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with DMCs, demand for ADB \nassistance, and developments in DMCs related to sustainable urban transport systems. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Sustainable Urban Transport, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n7  The 60 person-months of national institute consultancy will be undertaken by five national teams from the selected \ncountries.

General \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will require a total of 93 person-months of consulting \nservices, including 23 person-months for individual international consultants, 10 person-months \nfor individual national consultants, and 60 person-months for national institute/firm consultants. \nUnder  the  guidance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  team,  the  consultants  will  (i) \nundertake field studies in Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of China, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri \nLanka, taking into consideration previous studies and activities by the  governments, ADB, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the \nWorld Bank, and other donors; and (ii) hold extensive consultations with national and municipal \ngovernments, local stakeholders, and other donors. The consultants will (i) build on all recent \nand related ADB work and coordinate with related ongoing activities in ADB, (ii) identify best \npractices directly applicable to future ADB operations in urban transport, and (iii) make practical \nrecommendations to the governments.  \n \n2.  The consultants will include five country teams of national consultants that will be formed \nduring project inception. The international consultants will oversee and coordinate closely with \neach of the country teams. Country workshops will be held in each city to discuss the initial \ndesign of the study and the final proposed output. The consultants will maintain close contact \nwith  government  officials  and  with  other  donors.  The  team  leader  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating the work of the country teams assisted by the national study coordinator and \nensure that the outputs from each country team are in line with overall requirements.  \n \nB.  Consultants  \n \n1.  Urban Transport Specialists (international, 12.0 person-months) \n \n3.  The team leader will be an urban transport specialist. The team leader will work closely \nwith ADB, supervise and coordinate staff, and liaise with relevant government counterpart staff \nand national consultant teams to ensure timely implementation of the TA. The team leader will \nhave primary technical responsibility for reviewing and building on previous studies on urban \ntransport  in  the  selected  cities  and  coordinating  with  the  central  government,  municipal \ngovernments, local stakeholders, other donors, and team members to prepare a report that \naddresses the requirements for implementable and sustainable urban transport policies, plans, \nand programs that ADB can use as a guide for future operations. The team leader will provide \ntechnical guidance and direction to international consultants and national country teams in each \nof the selected cities to ensure that a focused approach is applied to the work.  \n \n4.  The consultants will undertake analytical work to prepare operationally relevant, Asian \nfocused, implementable frameworks for future interventions that cover all areas of sustainable \nurban  transport,  including  traffic  management  and  enforcement,  road  networks  and  their \nmaintenance, public transport provision and operations, institutional arrangements, policy, and \nprogramming. This will involve reviewing existing literature and urban transport or land use \nstudies, including ongoing work within and outside ADB, collecting relevant data, and analyzing \ntrends and issues. \n \n5.  The consultants will prepare a detailed framework analysis of urban transport; its current \nsituation as well as the legal, regulatory, and institutional arrangements. The impact of urban \ntransport  externalities  on  pollution,  safety,  and  access  by  all  members  of  society  will  be \n ", "Appendix 3  10 \nexamined. Examination of previous urban transport studies and of the ability to implement \nidentified priority projects will be used to assess and highlight any shortcomings in current \ndelivery  and  operations.  Remedial  actions  required  to  ensure  successful  and  efficient \nimplementation of future schemes and operational changes will be recommended.  \n \n6.  For urban transport, traffic management, public transport, road maintenance, road space \nallocation, enforcement, safety, pollution, and affordability, the consultants will evaluate the \ncurrent situation and future directions and what impacts institutional arrangements have on \nurban transport and on an enabling framework. Special attention will be given to how policy is \ndeveloped and acted upon and how urban transport infrastructure and services are planned and \nprogrammed, implemented, and financed. The study will emphasize the social, environmental, \nand  economic  impacts  of  urban  transport.  An  evaluation  framework  for  sustainable  urban \ntransport  will  be  developed,  drawing  on  the  findings  of  the  review  and  incorporating \nenhancements  required  to  ensure  more  effective  and  efficient  transport  infrastructure  and \nservice delivery and operations in the future. \n \n7.  The detailed study tasks will be further refined at the inception stage, but will include \ndeveloping outline regulatory and policy frameworks, planning and programming, and robust \nfinancial and operational plans. Together with the team of consultants, the urban transport \nspecialist will support and conduct seminars and workshops, help locate appropriate resource \npersons and institutions, review all deliverables and workshop materials, and coordinate the \nvarious activities required for the successful completion of the project.  \n \n8.  The consultants will propose effective investment programs to promote efficient urban \ntransport systems and will assess and propose adequate road network and public transport \nsystems to meet developmental demand. Coherent and progressive investment programs will \nbe designed for each of the cities. Particular attention will be given to future investment, which \nwill add a regional dimension to ADB\u2019s investment portfolio in urban transport, ones that can \nprovide key examples of best practices and replicable structures for future projects.  \n \n9.  The  consultants  will  propose  efficient  traffic  management  systems  to  significantly \nimprove the cities\u2019 internal traffic conditions at minimal cost. The systems will require (i) an \nappropriate transport policy framework under which governments can manage the demand for \ntransport by private vehicles; and (ii) strategic plans that cover junction operations, enforcement, \nroad  use,  intelligent  transport  systems,  education,  public  transport,  parking,  traffic  signals, \nvehicle restrictions, pavement markings, vehicle condition, and equitable allocation of road \nspace for all users. Current traffic management and highway maintenance in the cities will be \nreviewed, including the enforcement of traffic management laws and regulations. Proposals will \nbe  produced  to  ensure  effective  and  efficient  traffic  management  with  safe  and  equitable \nallocation  of  road  space.  Schemes  will  be  proposed  that  improve  the  efficiency  of  public \ntransport, which will not only lower costs, but a flexible framework, which makes public transport \nmore accessible to the poor. Solid institutional and regulatory structures will be proposed, which \nwill help create affordable public transport systems for poor users and give incentives for proper \nmaintenance, investment, and service expansion. \n \n10.  The consultants will establish a strategic development framework that will link urban \ntransport,  effective  environmental  management  and  inclusive  social  development.  The \nframework will require building new institutional capacities to improve regulatory frameworks; \nintroduce better land use planning; and promote integrated transport infrastructure schemes \nbased on affordable, environmentally-friendly public transport and nonmotorized transport.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n11.  The consultants will propose institutional reforms, which will increase efficiency and \nstrengthen the capacities of governments to manage the transport frameworks for effective \ndelivery and operation and enhance their capacities to provide customer-responsive services by \nmeans of financially sustainable operations. The requirements for agencies to allocate scarce \nbudgetary  resources  to  develop  and  introduce  sound  plans  and  operating  systems  and \nincorporate  the  latest  technologies  will  be  given  a  high  priority.  Modern  integrated  public \ntransport networks, which can increase overall network capacity through low capital-intensive \ninvestment, will be promoted. \n \n12.  Current public transport operations in the cities will be reviewed, along with future plans \nand  the  effectiveness  of  service  provision.  Coverage  by  public  transport,  route  allocation, \naffordability, and service will be reviewed to assess the ability of public transport to meet current \nand future demand. The integration of public transport services will be reviewed and measures \nwill be recommended  to ensure integrated and adequate service provision. The level of private \nsector involvement in public transport will be given special attention, as will the requirements to \nensure financially viable public transport operations.   \n \n13.  The  consultants  will  develop  a  strategic  framework  that  will  link  sustainable  urban \ntransport, effective environmental management, and inclusive social development. The strategic \nframework will concentrate on (i) institutional capacities for integrated policy, planning, and \nprogramming; (ii) adequate allocation and operation of road space for all transport modes and \nusers; (iii) efficient traffic management and enforcement systems, including a robust and reliable \nregulatory framework; (iv) energy-efficient urban transport; (v) urban transport and road safety; \n(vi)  reforms  of  urban  transport  services,  traffic  management,  and  maintenance;  (vii)  good \ngovernance; and (viii) inclusion of the special needs of the urban poor and of others without \nready access to transport services in planning and programming.  \n \n2.  Urban Development Specialist (international, 3.0 person-months) \n \n14.  The urban development specialist will undertake theoretically sound analytical work to \nprepare  an  operationally  relevant  and  Asia-focused  knowledge  product  covering  the  latest \nmodalities  and  innovative  solutions  for  urban  development  and  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment. This will incorporate a review of existing literature and studies of the selected \ncities, including work ongoing within and outside ADB, collection of data, analysis of trends and \nissues, identification of good practices and innovative approaches, and suggestions for the \nfuture. Innovative approaches to incorporating urban development and transport will be required, \nand proposed options will feed into the development framework, and must therefore be realistic \nand  implementable,  while  being  financially,  environmentally,  socially,  and  economically \nsustainable.  \n \n15.  The consultant will (i) review the responsibilities and activities of relevant government \nagencies, including their work practices and interactions between agencies; and (ii) provide \nbackground and insights on the institutional framework as it relates to urban development and \nurban transport systems and operations. The consultants will delineate the responsibilities of \neach institution and prepare proposals for improved coordination among agencies to boost \ngovernment efficiency in the urban and transport sectors. This will require assessing capacities \nand  developing  consistent  and  integrated  land  use  and  transport  plans,  plus  methods  for \ndelivery and operations under a holistic approach to urban transport and urban development \nthat covers the entire programming process for land use planning and transport infrastructure \nand operations. The consultants will examine governance issues and assess the impacts poor \ngovernance has on the urban transport.  \n ", "Appendix 3  12 \n \n3.  Social Development Specialist (international, 4.0 person-months) \n \n16.  In close collaboration with the transport specialist, the consultant will  \n \n(i)  Assess economic participation by the urban poor and the impacts of accessibility \nand transport costs.  \n(ii)  Design specific transport programs targeting the urban poor, such as subsidized \ntravel.  \n(iii)  Provide insights in relation to the inclusiveness of society as stakeholders in \npolicy and urban transport planning and service delivery, recommend how urban \ntransport systems can reflect the needs of the poor.  \n(iv)  Design inexpensive access to income-generating opportunities.  \n(v)  Assess the impacts of pollution on disadvantaged groups and propose measures \nto mitigate the impacts.   \n(vi)  Identify key social and environmental concerns to be integrated into transport \nplanning to ensure that development benefits accrue to the poor.  \n(vii)  Integrate social issues into the planning and management of urban transport.  \n(viii)  Prepare standards for pedestrians and bicyclists in traffic law.  \n(ix)  Identify institutional and physical barriers to access by diverse individuals and \ngroups to transport services and enhance incentives to improve access.  \n(x)  Assess the impact of major transport infrastructure projects on the urban poor, \nparticularly relocation requirements.  \n(xi)  Prepare a framework for integrating nonmotorized transport into the planning \nprocedures of municipal authorities.  \n \n4.  Financial Management Specialist (international, 4.0 person-months) \n \n17.  The  consultant  will  outline  planning  and  regulatory  arrangements  for  private  sector \nparticipation in urban transport and innovative financing options, such as combining public and \nprivate resources and using new financing modalities. The consultant will (i) review private \nsector participation and policy reform issues, planning, resource needs, and impact on the \noperation and maintenance of roads and other transport services and the status of private \nsector participation in the transport sector in the cities; and (ii) recommend, if necessary, a \ncorporate  structure  and  appropriate  schedule  for  achieving  sound  and  sustainable \ncommercialization of the transport operating entity. Based on lessons from previous projects, \ndue attention will be given to enhance transparency in the bidding process for the private sector \nto  optimize  the  gains  of  a  concession  or  franchise.  A  model  public-private  partnership \nframework will be developed, if relevant, that will specify the concession period and selection \ncriteria and ensure adequate pricing and transparent bidding. \n \n  5.  Study Coordinator (national, 10.0 person-months) \n \n18.  A  study  coordinator  will  be  hired  in  the  Philippines  and  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating the work and outputs of the various team members, including the national country \nteams;  providing  support,  and  liaising  closely  with  the  team  leader.  The  coordinator  will \nundertake the following specific tasks: \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \n(i)  Coordinate the work of and provide support to the project team and the TA \nimplementation team, including interaction between the international consultants \nand the five national country teams to ensure consistency in relation to individual \nissues and the overall framework.  \n(ii)  Plan the format of the output, including the contents of the overall transport \nsystem and investment framework and the summary paper.  \n(iii)  Interact closely with all the specialists throughout their assignments.  \n(iv)  Finalize conclusions with the specialists and integrate their outputs with that of \nthe team leader.  \n(v)  Help the team leader prepare an initial draft of the proposed output. \n(vi)  Ensure that initial draft reports are circulated and made available to relevant \ngovernment agencies, other donors, and all stakeholders. \n(vii)  Finalize the draft reports incorporating comments received from ADB staff. \n \n6.  National Institute or Firm Consultants (60.0 person-months) \n \n19.  In each of the five countries selected for the field studies, a national institute or firm will \nbe recruited that will have specialists in urban transport planning and programming, urban and \ntransport  institutional  development,  transport  policy  and  regulation,  urban  transport \nmanagement and enforcement, and poverty and social development. Each country team will \nwork closely with the international team and provide relevant information about and insights into \nthe  various  aspects  of  sustainable  urban  transport  in  relation  to  current  conditions  and \noperations, proposed development plans, and any institutional and operational adjustments \ncurrently under consideration. \n \n20.  The total 60 person-months of national institute/firm consultants will be roughly evenly \ndistributed among the five countries, with around 6 person-months for each country allocated for \nurban  transport-related  requirements  and  about  2  person-months  for  poverty  and  social \ndevelopment. As the required inputs from each area of expertise may vary among countries, \nspecific  durations  and  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  for  each  country  will  be \nfinalized during the inception stage.  \n \n21.  The main tasks of the national country teams will be to provide (i) high-quality, research-\nbased, and local knowledge inputs to the international consultants; and (ii) information required \nfor an in-depth understanding of the current urban transport situation. A list of key issues and \nconstraints within each of the cities will be prepared and compared with international experience \nto develop action plans and proposals for sustainable urban transport policies and for plans and \nprograms  with  robust  finances  and  institutional  arrangements  for  both  implementation  and \noperation. The national consultants will make sure that appropriate government agency staff are \nincluded in discussions during the TA and that all relevant central, local, and nongovernment \norganizations are informed of the findings of the study in order to provide additional insights.  \n \n22.  The TA is expected to commence in November 2006 and be completed by April 2008. \nThe consultants will submit the reports to ADB following this schedule: (i) inception report, \n7 weeks  after  the  commencement  of  services;  (ii)  interim  report,  17  weeks  after \ncommencement; (iii) draft final report, 27 weeks after commencement of services; and (iii) final \nreport, 7 weeks after receiving all comments. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061110115255+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061031093617+08'00'", "Title": "Sustainable Urban Transport", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  DMC  \u2013  developing member country \nRSDD  \u2013  Regional and Sustainable Development Department \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Transport \nSubsector  \u2013  Multimodal transport and sector development \nThemes  \u2013  Sustainable economic growth, environmental sustainability, and \ncapacity development  \nSubthemes  \u2013  Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets, developing \nurban areas, urban environmental improvement, public\u2013private \npartnerships, institutional development \n \nNOTE \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nVice President  Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development \nDirector General  B.
