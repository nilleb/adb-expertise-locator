During the 2003 country programming mission, the Government of the Socialist Republic \nof  Viet  Nam  (the  Government)  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for strengthening assessment and monitoring of poverty \nreduction and growth. An ADB mission visited Viet Nam from 11 October to 11 November 2004 \non a staggered basis to formulate the TA and to reach an understanding with the Government \non the goal, purpose, activities and inputs, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for \nthe TA.1\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s achievements in terms of social development and poverty reduction are \nremarkable.  Impressive  gains  in  reducing  poverty  were  made  during  the  last  decade.  As \nrecently as 1993, 58% of the population lived in poverty, compared with 37% in 1998 and 29% \nin 2002. Almost one third of the total population was lifted out of poverty in less than ten years. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  strategy  for  pro-poor  growth  and  poverty  reduction  is  clearly  charted  by  the \ncomprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy (CPRGS),2 and implementation of the \nCPRGS at the provincial level and monitoring its achievements are major challenges. In addition \nto poverty and inequality indicators, it has succeeded in quantifying other measures of social \nand economic progress, sometimes at the subnational level. For example, the National Center \nfor Social Sciences and Humanities computes a human development index (HDI) for provinces. \nThe Viet Nam Development Goals (VDGs) are directly linked to the internationally accepted \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), with the targets associated with each VDGs tailored to \nnational circumstances.3 There are gaps, however, in the VDGs in terms of measurable result \nindicators. The HDI can be seen as an indicator of success in the implementation of the \nCPRGS, although, unlike the VDGs, the HDI is an aggregate, and does not directly show which \ndevelopment efforts should receive emphasis, for example education or health.  \n \n3.  Several poverty and social development indicators are currently used in Viet Nam but \nthey are not always consistent and do not always follow commonly accepted or international \nstandards. The many blanks in the VDGs matrix highlight the difficulty of establishing clearly \nspelled-out indicators for the VDGs. Monitoring the CPRGS and the 5-year socioeconomic \ndevelopment plan, 2006 \u2013 2010 (SEDP), will be even more challenging. In addition, indicators of \nmacroeconomic,4 sector and local performance are yet to be developed. General aggregated \nindicators are needed at the three levels: central, sector, and local and in thematic areas such \nas governance (covering public finance, public administration, grassroots democracy, and anti-\ncorruption initiatives), employment and labor skills, and gender equality and ethnic minority \nadvancement. \n \n 4.  The General Statistics Office (GSO) carries out a multipurpose Viet Nam household \nliving standard survey (VHLSS) every two years and uses both income and expenditure data to \n                                                 \n1  The mission comprised R. Adhikari (mission leader), Vo Truc Dien, Programs Officer/Economist, Ngo Huong, \nPoverty  Reduction  Specialist,  VRM,  and  A.  Rijk,  Poverty  Reduction  Specialist,  VRM.  It  was  followed  by \nconsultation meetings with the Government in later months to finalize the scope and activities in line with the \nrequirements of the new 5-year socioeconomic development plan preparation. The TA first appeared in ADB \nBusiness Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 October 2004. \n2  Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2003. The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS).  \n    Viet Nam. \n3  In all, there are 11 goals with 32 targets and 136 indicators.  \n4   CPRGS, Appendix 1 page 139-147.  ", "2       \ncompute the poverty rate5 and related indicators. In addition to collecting common statistical \nindicators, GSO\u2019s main strength is in producing relatively accurate estimates of aggregate and \nprovincial  poverty.  The  2004  VHLSS  fieldwork  was  completed  by  the  end  of  2004  and \nprocessing began during the second quarter of 2005. The Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social \nAffairs (MOLISA) defines poverty based on household income; households are deemed poor if \ntheir income per capita falls below a threshold that varies depending on whether they are in \nurban, rural or mountainous areas.6 The MOLISA definition is valuable for identifying the poor at \nthe local level, but the income thresholds for the different types of communes appear to be quite \narbitrary and are not necessarily comparable. In addition, only households which have already \nbeen issued with a \u201cpoor-household certificate\u201d are surveyed. The Government has indicated \nthat it will need some international and national technical expertise to develop the methodology \nand help with the processing of data, taking into account the additional indicators needed to \nmonitor the SEDP.   \n \n5.  The  Government  recognizes  that  monitoring  of  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment needs to be improved at all levels. In particular, at the sector and local levels, an \neffective monitoring system for the CPRGS is needed to support decentralized planning and to \nplan implementation of various projects and programs, including public administration reform. \nThe GSO is undertaking an assessment of existing systems and requirements and preparing a \ncommon framework.7 The preliminary results indicate that, out of 136 indicators related to \nCPRGS and SEDP, 83 can be validated by the GSO; 47 are possible but have still not been \nagreed by line ministries and would require new methodologies and additional data; and 16 are \nconsidered  unknown  by  the  GSO  and  would  require  detailed  studies  and  research  into \ninternational best practices if methodologies are to be developed and piloted.  \n \n6.  The SEDP is expected to integrate basic elements of CPRGS and serve as Viet Nam\u2019s \nnational strategy for poverty reduction. Viet Nam is one of the first three countries where a \nresults-based country strategy and program (CSP) is being piloted. ADB is introducing a results-\nbased framework for the preparation with the Government of a new CSP for 2007\u20132009. The \nnew CSP will be clearly aligned with the next SEDP, CPRGS, and the VDGs. It will establish \nkey result indicators at the national level, based on what ADB has done in the past and will do in \nthe future to reduce poverty. A common results framework with result indicators that are capable \nof being monitored and are acceptable to the Government and its development partners would \nbe very useful. This idea is monitorable and was raised at a seminar organized by ADB in \nOctober 2004 and was generally accepted. ADB\u2019s new CSP will be processed at the same time \nwith other development partners, including the World Bank.  \n \n7.  The proposed TA would support implementation of ADB\u2019s managing for development \nresults framework in Viet Nam and the preparation of the new CSP for Viet Nam and in the \nmonitoring and assessment of its implementation.  \n \n \n                                                 \n5  It defines a threshold based on the cost of a consumption basket which includes food and non-food items. The food \nitems should ensure 2,100 calories per day. Households are considered poor when their income or expenditure \nlevel is not sufficient to afford this consumption basket. \n6  In urban areas, this MOLISA poverty line is currently D150,000 per month, for rural lowland areas D100,000, and \nfor mountain and remote areas as well as distant islands D80,000. It is proposing the new poverty line for 2005 to \nbe D200,000 for rural areas and D260,000 for urban areas.  \n7 With the assistance from UNDP and DFID. Concept note, September 2004.

Impact and Outcome \n8.  The overall goal of the TA is to help the Government to strengthen its institutional \ncapability to conduct results-based monitoring of poverty reduction and growth in Viet Nam. The \npurpose of the TA is to assist the Government to introduce a results framework, develop results \nindicators,  and  train  key  officials  in  these  areas.  In  particular,  the  TA  will  provide  the \nGovernment and its development partners with a system of measurable development results \nindicators, on which to base, evaluate, and adjust the CPRGS; the SEDP at national, sector and \nthematic  levels;  and  related  official  development  assistance.  The  TA  would  assist  key \ngovernment agencies to develop efficient methodologies and apply them in assessing and \nmonitoring development results of the CPGRS and SEDP. Expected outcomes of the TA would \nbe (i) introduction of a results framework and results indicators in SEDP, (ii) stronger links \nbetween ADB\u2019s new CSP and the SEDP, with results indicators capable of being monitored, \nand (iii) enhanced understanding and skills of government officials in results-based planning \nand monitoring of development results. \n \n9.  The key outputs of the TA would include (i) a results framework for the SEDP and a set \nof results indicators at the aggregate level, arrived at by refining and extending those that \nalready exist and developing new indicators of  an internationally accepted standard; (ii) a \nmethodology for collecting, processing, and analyzing results at sector and thematic levels ; (iii) \ntraining of government officials on the concept and application of managing for development \nresults;  and  (iv)  user-friendly  guidelines  and  instructions  on  development  results.  The  TA \nframework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  In the first stage of the TA, one of the key activities will be to develop the system of \nresults  indicators  and  a  results  framework  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  CPGRS  (and \nsubsequently the SEDP at national and provincial levels) including:8 (i) indicators to evaluate the \nimpact of every program and strategy affecting the poor and the whole of society,  (ii) indicators \nto monitor and evaluate achievements9 towards the targets of the CPGRS and SEDP, (iii) \nindicators  to  monitor  outputs  of  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction,  and  (iv) \nindicators to monitor and evaluate resource inputs for the strategy. With assistance from UNDP, \nthe  GSO  has  consulted  with  key  ministries10  with  a  view  to  preparing  a  list  of  proposed \nindicators for monitoring the SEDP which would be submitted to the National Assembly for final \napproval  by  first  quarter  of  2006.  The  UNDP  and  DFID  project  on  strengthening  national \nstatistical capacity for monitoring socioeconomic development and progress towards achieving \nthe MDGs and VDGs is expected to provide analytical and institutional support to review and \nstrengthen the statistical indicators, including their definition, methodology, and frequency of \ncollection; the agencies responsible for collection; and other related issues. The proposed TA \nwill analyze the SEDP indicators; the Vietnamese statistical indicators; and the VDGs and \nMDGs indicators, with a view to producing a common set of results indicators. The TA will also \nanalyze  the  monitoring  system,  including  the  frequency  of  collection  and  the  agencies \nresponsible as required. The TA will ensure stakeholders are consulted so the indicators meet \ntheir requirements.  \n                                                 \n8  See CPRGS, 2003, page 137.  \n9  Achievements meaning \u201coutcomes\u201d in PPMS (project performance management system) terminology \n10  The national workshop was organized among GSO, ministries, and donors on 14\u201315 December 2004, which \ndiscussed on tentative proposal of 285 statistical indicators. ", "4       \n \n11.  The TA project will work closely with the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), \nGSO, MOLISA, and the Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs (CEMA), and with other ministries \nto design methodologies and apply them to developing a system for estimating and monitoring \n(i) sector- and project-level results indicators and (ii) thematic area results indicators covering \ngender, social quintiles and ethnic groups, governance, and private sector development. This \nwill be carried out in line with ongoing work, including work on the 5-year sector level plan and \nsector and thematic road maps.  It is crucial that the Government be supported to finalize the \nproposal for a national poverty line,11 both in terms of definition and methodology. User-friendly \nguidelines and instructions will be developed to guide future work and updates.  \n \n12.   Another important activity of the proposed TA would be to work with the GSO in refining \n2004 VHLSS data, at national, sector, and provincial levels.12 This would be carried out by \nworking closely with the GSO team and with international and domestic experts. The work \nwould complement the development of indicators capable of being monitored and would update \nthe poverty indicators based on the analysis of the 2004 VHLSS data. \n \n 13.  In the second stage, the TA would undertake a series of dissemination and consultation \nworkshops to familiarize central and local government agencies with the results framework, \nindicators and monitoring arrangements and to build consensus. Seminars would be organized \nto exchange knowledge and information on results-based planning and monitoring, and on \nresults-based country strategy formulation and programming.  \n \n14.   Capacity building through on-the-job and in-house training will be an important part of \nthe TA activities. The TA will train selected staff from the pilot government agencies (e.g., MPI, \nMOLISA, GSO, and CEMA), local government agencies (e.g., provincial level departments of \nplanning and investment, and labor, provincial ethnic minority committees, training academies \nand universities in estimating and measuring indicators for the results framework at selected \nsector and provincial levels. A detailed program will be developed during TA implementation in \nconsultation with the MPI, GSO, and MOLISA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $105,000 in \nforeign exchange and $395,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested a \nTA grant in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to meet the total foreign \nexchange cost and part of the local currency cost from the Cooperation Fund in support of \nManaging for Development Results. The remaining portion amounting to $100,000 of the local \ncurrency cost will be financed in kind by the Government through the provision of counterparts, \noffice facilities, and other support facilities. Details of the cost estimates are given in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MPI will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall coordination of the TA, working \nclosely with Viet Nam Resident Mission (VRM). The MPI has recently been assigned by the \nGovernment  with  the  task  of  integrating  the  CPGRS  into  annual  as  well  as  5-year  socio \neconomic development plans. It is also responsible for regularly monitoring implementation of \n                                                 \n11  Various possible methodologies for national poverty line are still in discussion with GSO and MOLISA.  \n12 This activity would first review the work carried out by the GSO and Vietnam Academy of Social Science, Institute \nof Economics for the World Bank. ", "      5\nthe CPRGS and for preparing a comprehensive overview for the Prime Minister. The MPI will \nensure close collaboration and harmonization between the various central government agencies \nand sectors, and synergy with other ongoing projects.  \n   \n17.  Intensive involvement of, and interaction with, all stakeholders on the new SEDP during \nthe implementation of the TA will be required. During the inception of the TA, a seminar will be \nheld to explain the purpose and proposed activities of the TA and to present the work plan. The \nEA will ensure that the activities are well aligned with other efforts and regular national and \nprovincial workshops and meetings will be organized.  \n \n18.  The TA will require 6 person-months of international consultants and 30 person-months \nof  domestic  consultants.  The  team  of  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  quantitative  data \ncollection  and  analysis,  socioeconomic  development  planning  and  monitoring,  a  good \nunderstanding of results-based management, and a track record in capacity building. Outline \nterms of reference (TOR) and reporting requirements for consultants are presented in Appendix \n3. The consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants.  As  appropriate,  national  and  provincial  universities  and  the  GSO  may  be \nconsidered for survey work and processing data on a contractual basis. The costs involved in \nundertaking these assessments and surveys will be funded by ADB through the TA budget. \n   \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months and is expected to take place from July \n2005 to December 2006. The consultants working closely with the MPI will prepare and submit \nan inception report within the first month of the commencement of the TA, a midterm report after \n12 months, and draft final report at the end of the TA.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund in support of Managing for \nDevelopment Results for the purpose of Results-based Monitoring of Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   A\np\n DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK      p\ne\n  n\nd\nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Data  Assumptions and Risks  ix 1\nSouMrceecsh/aRneispmorsti n  g             \nImpact       \nTo strengthen the institutional capacity of the  National, sector and local levels  CPRGS and SEDP   \nGovernment for results-based monitoring of  indicators fully developed  progress reports \npoverty reduction and growth     \nMethodologies for measuring indicators  TA implementation \ndeveloped  progress reports  \n \nTraining of key government officials \nconducted \n \nOutcomes (immediate and short term):  A set of indicators identified, added, and  Reports on results  Assumptions \nTo assist the Government   validated for Viet Nam development  framework and  \u2022  Continued \n\u2022  Introduction of results-based approach in  results, i.e., poverty reduction and  indicators   government \ndevelopment planning and development  growth    commitments to adopt \nresult indicators    Workshop and  results-based \n  Enhanced understanding of results  seminar  planning and \n\u2022  Enhanced capacity of government  framework and result indicators of key  proceedings and  monitoring \ninstitutions and officials to develop more  government officials, i. e., consultative  feedback   \nsystematic mechanisms for monitoring of  discussion among stakeholders on the    \u2022  Government and ADB \npoverty reduction and growth  results-based approach; a designed  Approved new CSP  continue to share the \n  results framework proposed to SEDPs  same vision in \n  and sector programs   monitoring poverty \n    reduction and growth \n  Adoption of results framework and   \n  results indicators in national, sector, and   \n  local planning, i. e. clear results-based    \n  SEDPs \n \nPreparation of a results-based CSP for \nViet Nam \n ", "Design Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Data  Assumptions and Risks \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Full mobilization of \n1.
