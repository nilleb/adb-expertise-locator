THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic  approach  for  the  Economic  Management  Improvement  Program,  and  (ii)  a \nproposed policy-based loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for subprogram 1 of the Economic \nManagement Improvement Program.1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for the Economic Management Improvement Program, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed programmatic approach aims to strengthen economic management in \nUzbekistan and thus support macroeconomic stability and sustained high growth. Sustained high \ngrowth is a prerequisite for job creation. The program will (i) introduce important fiscal reforms to \nensure fiscal sustainability; (ii) improve governance in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to make \ntheir operations financially viable; (iii) improve access to bank finance by strengthening bank \nsupervision to facilitate competitive financing of private sector operations, especially small and \nmedium-sized enterprises; and (iv) strengthen economic data collection, analysis, management, \nand dissemination systems to bolster economic decision-making. Programmatic budget support \nwill finance two subprograms, each designated as a fully front-loaded single-tranche intervention \nto be implemented during 2018\u20132019. The attached TA will assist in implementing the program. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Uzbekistan\u2019s economic growth has been strong in the past decade, which helped reduce \npoverty levels. Strong external demand and buoyant export performance of gas, gold, and copper, \naided by high commodity prices, generated state budget revenues that financed large-scale public \ninvestment in infrastructure development and industrial modernization. The remittances, mainly \nfrom the Russian Federation, and consistent increases in public sector wages and pensions \nsupported consumption growth. However, from 2013 onwards, declining global commodity prices, \nsubdued growth in some export destination countries,2 and more recently, an economic downturn \nin the Russian Federation successively affected Uzbek exports, budget revenues, and household \nincomes. In response, authorities implemented countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies to \nstimulate domestic demand. Consequently, gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed only \nmarginally from 8.0% in 2014 to 7.8% in 2016. However, growth declined further in 2017 to 5.3% \nas the economy adjusted to the adverse impacts of a significant devaluation of the local currency.3 \nRising inflationary pressures with the official exchange rate depreciating by about 48% subdued \nconstruction and service activities. Agriculture also suffered as the prices of imported inputs nearly \ndoubled in local currency. \n \n4.  In September 2017, the government initiated a comprehensive exchange rate reform to \nsolve  long-standing  difficulties  associated  with  limited  access  to  foreign  exchange  and \nrequirements to surrender foreign exchange, which brought parallel exchange markets and \neconomic distortions. The lack of access to foreign exchange was, for years, a key deterrent to \nforeign investment and private sector development. Thus, the reform aimed to promote foreign \ninvestment, private sector development, and exports. It allowed free access to foreign currency \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  These countries include Kazakhstan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Russian Federation, and Turkey. \n3  Uzbekistan:  Selected  Economic  Indicators  2015\u20132019.  IMF  Press  Release  No.  18/168.  9  May  2018. \n(http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/05/09/pr18168-imf-executive-board-concludes-2018-article-iv-\nconsultation-with-the-republic-of-uzbekistan).  ", "2 \nfor private firms. However, liberalizing the foreign exchange market created many macroeconomic \nchallenges because of weak governance structure in some areas. For one, high inflation and \naccelerated local currency depreciation inflated the credit risk of unhedged foreign currency \nborrowers, primarily large SOEs.4 In response, the government launched some complementary \nreforms, at a substantial cost, both additional expenditures and revenue losses, to facilitate a soft \nlanding and minimum disorder in economic management.5 However, the costs associated with \nthese reforms pose fiscal and debt sustainability risks.6 Without these complementary measures, \nforeign exchange market reforms would have been difficult to implement efficiently. Developments \nduring late 2017 exposed areas that will require stronger governance structures to minimize \nvulnerabilities to shocks, as discussed below. \n \n5.  Large public sector and inefficient fiscal management.7 The key deficiencies are          \n(i) relatively weak oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from public sector entities; (ii) weak internal \ncontrols in large ministries; (iii) lack of public access to key fiscal information; (iv) lack of a \nmedium-term  fiscal  framework  to  ensure  a  multiyear  perspective  in  fiscal  planning  and \nexpenditure policy and budgeting; (v) lack of competition, value for money, and controls in \nprocurement; (vi) weak management of fiscal risks related to SOEs;8 and (vii) lack of coordination \nof development partners\u2019 aid. State and consolidated budgets are not based on long-term national \nand  sector-specific  strategic  objectives  and  programs.9 SOEs  dominate  all  the  important \nsegments of the economy, and thus leave little space for the private sector. These segments \ninclude energy (power generation and transmission; and oil and gas refining, transportation, and \ndistribution);  metallurgy;  mining  (nonferrous  metals  and  uranium);  telecommunication  (fixed \ntelephony  and  data  transmission);  agriculture  (cotton  processing);  machinery  (automotive \nindustry, locomotive, and aircraft production and repair); and transport (airlines, railways, and \nmunicipal public transport). Moreover, inefficient upstream SOEs dealing with public utilities have \nan adverse impact on the downstream private companies. At present, Uzbekistan does not \nadhere to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines on \nCorporate Governance of SOEs.10 SOEs are subject to domestic accounting standards and rules, \nwhich are still not fully comparable with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \n \n6.  Inefficient banking intermediation and supervision. The banking system in Uzbekistan \nis still closely controlled by the state through a complex set of regulatory actions. Most banking \nassets remain in state-owned or state-controlled banks,11 and most loans are directed by the \ngovernment to develop certain preselected programs or sectors. The banking system includes 2 \nstate  banks,  13  joint-stock  commercial  banks,  8  private  banks,  and  5  banks  with  foreign \ninvestments. Banks\u2019 corporate and retail deposits comprise only about 56% of their non-equity \nfunding. Loans from the government and funding from international financial institutions are the \ntwo other important sources of non-equity funding. Moreover, state-owned banks have a strong \ninfluence over systemic loan growth and interest rates through their participation in state-run \n                                                \n4  The year-end consumer price inflation was 18.9% in 2017, compared to 7.9% in 2016 (source: footnote 3). \n5  Moderating inflation without losing jobs is necessary for this purpose. Creating adequate jobs remains the main \nchallenge for the government. \n6  More on this in Section D (para. 16). \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  Some of the important deficiencies in the governance structure of SOEs include weak controls of payroll and non-\npayroll expenditures, poor quality and timeliness in preparing financial statements and audits, poor legislative scrutiny \nand lack of follow-up of external audits, and non-transparency of relevant information. \n9  When there are uncertainties about the state of the state\u2019s finances, investors demand higher-risk premiums on \ngovernment debt, which affects private demand via the interest rate. Contingent liabilities of the government are an \nimportant source of uncertainties. \n10 http://www.oecd.org/corporate/guidelines-corporate-governance-SOEs.htm  \n11 The market share is about 80% in terms of assets. Also, state-controlled banks have large loan exposures to SOEs. \n ", "3 \nlending programs, and they enjoy the privilege of servicing the domestic blue-chip companies. \nConsequently, banks cannot play the role of effective financial intermediaries, which inhibits the \nability of citizens or private companies to obtain credit and other banking services.12 Therefore, \nUzbekistan has low levels of corporate and personal indebtedness. The ratio of domestic credit \nto GDP was about 43.1% by the end of 2017. Banking supervision, including capital and liquidity \nassessments, remains irregular. Hence, more focus should be put on developing banks, enabling \nthem to provide much cheaper and more efficient financing for private investments. Moreover, \nUzbekistan\u2019s debt and capital markets remain extremely shallow. The domestic capital market is \nunderdeveloped and does not help private entrepreneurs to raise funds. Similarly, the domestic \nprivate sector bond market transacts less than 0.5% of banks\u2019 liabilities. \n \n7.  Lack  of  transparent  and  efficient  data  dissemination  systems.  Timely  flows  of \naccurate socioeconomic data will remain an important driver of growth and change. Flows of data \nplay a significant role in creating new economic paradigms, as envisaged by the government. \nPoor  data  quality  and  standards  are  detrimental  to  private  investment  decisions  and  for \nprioritization of public projects. The data collection, analysis, and dissemination systems are quite \nweak  in  Uzbekistan  and  amplify  other  macroeconomic  challenges.  Data  systems  require \nsignificant strengthening to enable the policy makers to make informed decisions in the areas of \nmacroeconomic planning and management.13 This is equally important from the perspective of \nforeign investors willing to invest in Uzbekistan. \n \n8.  The loan, the first programmatic approach intervention in Uzbekistan, draws on lessons \nlearned from related initiatives in Uzbekistan and in other countries in the Central and West Asia \nregion.14 Strong government commitment and adequate support from all stakeholders are the two \nimportant prerequisites for a successful policy-based reform program.15 Thus, setting realistic \npolicy actions is crucial to ensure the government\u2019s commitment. A programmatic approach, \nsupported by adequate TA support, is appropriate for this purpose. Similar lessons were also \nidentified for the World Bank\u2019s Banking Sector Restructuring and Privatization Project in Pakistan. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Value Addition \n9.  The Government of Uzbekistan is committed to transform the economy into an open and \ndiversified  structure  and  improve  resilience  to  macroeconomic  shocks.  The  government \nrecognizes that this will also require complete transparency in economic data collection and \ndissemination. In February 2017, after Uzbekistan\u2019s first change in leadership in 25 years, the \ngovernment adopted a 5-year national development strategy, 2017\u20132021.16 It sets five priority \nareas  for  reform.  These  priority  areas  are  essentially  addressing  the  issues  covering                        \n(i) governance and public administration; (ii) the rule of law and the judicial system; (iii) economic \n                                                \n12 The World Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys in 2015 showed that almost 75% of firms did not avail themselves of bank \nloans, and the value of collateral was on average 176% of the loan amount. \n13 The problem of planning and economic management without facts is well documented, including in World Bank. \n1983.

Tashkent. \n ", "4 \ndevelopment and liberalization; (iv) social development; and (v) security, tolerance, and foreign \npolicy. The strategy articulates the government\u2019s vision for the development of a conducive \nenvironment for private sector development, and recognizes the need to improve public sector \nmanagement, the banking sector, and the financial performance of SOEs (including key SOEs in \nthe power sector). One of the three priority strategies is to modernize the governance system, \nincluding greater ownership and transparency of the budget process, and a gradual transitioning \nto program budgeting, with the aim to increase the effectiveness of government operation and \nmaintenance expenditures. The government also plans to make SOEs regionally competitive and \nuse  the  market  mechanism  to  distribute  resources  and  manage  government  assets.  The \ngovernment is committed to end unproductive transfers and subsidies to SOEs from the budget \nand convert loss-making SOEs into profit-making entities.17 This is planned to be achieved \nthrough restructuring and, for smaller SOEs, through outright privatization. The government \nintends to gradually move to the International Public Sector Accounting Standards across all \ngovernment agencies by 2020. There is an ambitious economic reform agenda to stabilize the \nbalance of payments and put the country on a different, more sustainable growth path. \n \n10.  The Strategy of Actions on Further Development of Uzbekistan, 2017\u20132021 includes key \npolicy reforms to address issues related to access to finance and foreign currencies.18 The \nbanking sector\u2019s performance is critical for the macroeconomic policy measures of the Central \nBank of Uzbekistan (CBU) to succeed. As such, the government plans to improve banking \nsupervision by moving to a risk-based approach, improve the quality of bank assets, and attract \nadditional  investment.  The  government  reiterated  the  need  for  consistent  policies  and \ninterpretation of regulatory requirements to build confidence in the banking sector. In 2017, a \nseries of government documents were adopted to reform the banking sector and make the CBU \nmore independent. Recent activities include taking various actions to remove potential conflicts \nof interest, excluding CBU staff participation on the supervisory boards of state-owned and \ncontrolled banks, transferring management of CBU shares in two state-owned banks to the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), eliminating barriers to accessing cash and foreign currency, and \nprotecting commercial banks from administrative pressures. A systematic review of the entire \nlegal  framework  applicable  to  banks  was  initiated  in  mid-2017  to  identify  and  address \ninconsistencies and ambiguities. \n \n11.  The program will facilitate identification and implementation of key reforms to address the \ndevelopment challenges, as explained above (paras 5\u20137), and improve economic management \nin Uzbekistan. This is a prerequisite for diversification of the economy with improved participation \nof the private sector. This is expected to be achieved under the programmatic approach. The \nproposed reforms are grouped in three areas:19 \n(i)  Macroeconomic data collection, analysis, and dissemination systems. The \nloan will facilitate implementation of an enhanced general data dissemination \nsystem (e-GDDS) over two subprograms.20 The necessary orders for the adoption \nof  the  e-GDDS  issued  under  subprogram  1,  and  the  e-GDDS  will  be  fully \nimplemented under subprogram 2. The government will also submit a plan for \nimplementation  of  the  special  data  dissemination  standard  (SDDS)  under \nsubprogram  2.  Similarly,  the  CBU\u2019s  data  dissemination  systems  will  be \nstrengthened under both subprograms: (a) necessary instructions were issued for \n                                                \n17 As per the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (14 November 2017), the electricity tariff increased by 12% and the \ngas tariff by 10% from 1 April 2018. \n18 See footnote 16 for reference. \n19 See the Policy Matrix (Appendix 4) for sequencing of the proposed reforms under each reform area. \n20 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is supporting this initiative with TA support. A dedicated website has already \nbeen operationalized for data dissemination. \n ", "5 \nregular publication of data on monetary aggregates, banking activities, foreign \nexchange  reserves,  and  balance  of  payments  on  the  CBU  website  under \nsubprogram 1; and (b) the proposed data dissemination systems on the CBU \nwebsite will be fully operationalized under subprogram 2. \n(ii)  Fiscal and financial management. Many important fiscal reforms are proposed \nunder the programmatic approach.21 Under subprogram 1, MOF disseminated the \npublic expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) prepared in 2012 on its \nwebsite with an action-taken report; MOF will update the PEFA under subprogram \n2. To improve budget preparation, MOF issued necessary guidance to use all 12 \nbudget  accounting  standards  (in  line  with  the  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting  Standards)  for  the  preparation  of  the  2020  budget.  Actual \nimplementation  of  these  standards  will  begin  under  subprogram  2.  Similar \nsequencing  will  be  followed  to  introduce  internal  audits  in  key  government \ndepartments  to  improve  internal  controls.22 Introducing  discipline  in  budget \nallocation based on developmental priorities by adopting a medium-term budget \nframework  (MTBF)  is  proposed  under  subprogram  2.23 Several  reforms  are \nproposed to improve financial market supervision and reduce the cost of financial \nintermediation for the private sector. CBU prepared capital adequacy assessment \nstatement for selected banks, and conducted stress testing under subprogram 1.24 \nBased on these reports, the CBU will prepare an action plan to address shortfalls \nin loan-loss provisioning, capital shortfalls, and liquidity shortfalls for the selected \nbanks under subprogram 2.25 Two important initiatives under subprogram 2 are     \n(i) finalizing the guidelines for implementation of risk-based bank supervision and \n(ii) designing the policies to reduce directed lending. \n(iii)  State-owned enterprise governance and private sector operations. Several \nreforms are proposed to improve the functioning of SOEs\u2014logically sequenced \nover two subprograms. These reforms are necessary to create fiscal space, \nfacilitate private sector operations, and strengthen public service delivery. The \ncorporate governance rules (CGRs) prepared under subprogram 1, based on the \n2015 OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of SOEs (para. 5), and order \nissued for implementation of CGRs in selected SOEs. Implementation will be \noperationalized under subprogram 2. Public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) will be \nstrengthened in Uzbekistan through the PPP law submitted to the Parliament for \napproval  under  subprogram  1.  Based  on  this  law,  specific  projects  will  be \n                                                \n \n21The government is currently designing specific tax reform proposal covering (i) improvements in tax administration, \n(ii) enlargement of the tax base, (iii) simplification of the tax rules, and (iv) transparency in selection of the cases for \ntax incentives. ADB may also consider supporting selected tax reform initiatives under subprogram 2. IMF provided \ntechnical assistance support for this purpose.  \n22 Many reforms under this area, such as improving internal controls and updating PEFA, will improve public financial \nmanagement and strengthen governance and anticorruption efforts. \n23 Effective budget management requires a medium-term perspective, as a single-year perspective does not provide \nadequate flexibility to implement a government\u2019s development priorities while ensuring allocative efficiency of scarce \npublic resources. M. Cangiano, T. Curristine, and M. Lazare, eds. 2013. Public Financial Management and Its \nEmerging Architecture. Washington, DC: IMF. The OECD points to the importance of medium-term budgetary \nplanning, particularly in cases where (i) capital projects with changing operational costs are implemented; (ii) \nprograms come into effect toward the end of the year, and their full annual costs are not materializing in the initial \nyear; and (iii) programs\u2019 spending implications are not visible in the given year but would become so in the following \nyears. OECD. 2014. Budgeting Practices and Procedures in OECD Countries. Paris. \n24 These initiatives in the area of improved financial management will be supported by regular and quarterly stress tests \nof banks supported under the World Bank\u2019s Development Policy Operation in 2018. \n25 The banks\u2019 capital adequacy ratios are currently higher than the threshold level, but banks will require additional \ncapital to support higher lending to the private sector.  \n ", "6 \ndeveloped by the government under subprogram 2.26 Another related reform is the \ndivestment of noncore assets of SOEs. The government approved noncore assets \nfor two selected SOEs and will finalize its divestment by 2019 under subprogram \n2. Several critical reforms are proposed to improve financial management of JSC \nUzbekenergo,27 including completion of fixed asset revaluation by 2019,28 and \nfinalization of an IFRS-compliant consolidated audited financial statement for \n2017\u2014both under subprogram 2.29 Under subprogram 1, MOF also approved a \nsustainable debt management strategy for JSC Uzbekenergo. \n \n12.  The value addition of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) stems from its long experience \nin designing and implementing policy-based loans in the Central and West Asia region, covering \nsimilar areas. ADB\u2019s value addition can be categorized under four broad groups: (i) facilitating \nidentification  of key  reforms  and  international best  practices  in  several  areas  of  economic \nmanagement\u2014as highlighted in the policy matrix; (ii) providing operational support to implement \ncomplex reforms (such as an MTBF, internal audit, corporate governance, risk-based banking \nsupervision, etc.) with the help of the attached TA;30 (iii) creating synergies with ADB\u2019s sector-\nspecific support to facilitate timely implementation of selected policy actions under the program; \nand (iv) coordinating with other development partners to provide a unified reform package to the \ngovernment. ADB\u2019s support for the policy-based loans in other countries in this region also \nhighlights the importance of effective coordination among the development partners. \n \n13.  Coordination among development partners. The World Bank is currently processing a \nbudget support program (development policy operation of $500 million) for Uzbekistan. The \nproposed prior actions are divided across three pillars: (i) foundation for sustainable economic \ngrowth  and  macro-financial  resilience,  (ii)  supporting  market  creation  for  private-sector \ndevelopment, and (iii) enabling jobs, and managing social risks. Both institutions are collaborating \nin dealing with identifying and implementing reforms to promote improved banking supervision, \nfacilitate  financial  transparency  in  selected  SOEs  (such  as  introduction  of  IFRS-compliant \nfinancial statements), and private sector development.31 The main objective of this collaboration \nis to introduce complementary reforms and reinforce a concerted reform effort. ADB is also \ncoordinating  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  and  sharing  TA  resources  for \nstrengthening data collection, analysis, and dissemination (reform area 1). The Government of \nSwitzerland is also providing TA resources to finalize the design and coverage of the national \nsummary data page, with the support of ADB and the IMF. The proposed programmatic approach \nalso addresses many reform proposals highlighted in the IMF\u2019s 2018 Article IV consultation staff \nreport  for  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan.  The  important  reforms  include:  (i)  supporting \nimplementation of  e-GDDS and SDDS, with the help of capacity development support and \ntargeted policy actions, to strengthen data dissemination; (ii) improving fiscal transparency; (iii) \n                                                \n26 ADB will provide support under the attached TA. \n27 JSC Uzbekenergo has been selected to complement ADB\u2019s interventions in the energy sector. \n28 Asset revaluation allows firms to take into account changes in the fair value of some assets when determining their \ncarrying amounts in financial statements. Fixed asset revaluation of energy companies is usually needed under two \nsets of circumstances: when there are (i) regulatory issues where higher asset values will require higher tariffs set \nby the regulatory commission; and (ii) restructuring issues where knowledge about the true value of fixed assets is \ncritical before embarking on a major restructuring, including unbundling of electricity operation. \n29 JSC  Uzbekenergo  has  already  completed  an  IFRS-compliant  financial  statement  for  2015.  Moreover,  JSC \nUzbekenergo  has  already  operationalized  the  Center  for  Financial  Management  and  International  Financial \nStandards with 28 qualified staff to facilitate preparation of the financial statements. ADB is taking the lead in this \narea and provided technical assistance support. \n30 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 In addition to providing cross-references in their respective program documentation, ADB and the World Bank issued \na joint letter, addressed to the Government of Uzbekistan, highlighting the government\u2019s critical role in addressing \nimportant issues related to improved public financial management and delivery of their respective programs. \n ", "7 \nstrengthening supervisory capacity of CBU using the risk-based supervision system; (iv) allowing \nbanks  to  function  in  line  with  the  international  best  practices  to  facilitate  private  sector \ndevelopment; and (v) implementing comprehensive corporate governance rules in SOEs. Thus, \nADB\u2019s collaboration spans both program design and policy implementation. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n14.  Uzbekistan\u2019s overarching development objective is the facilitation of macroeconomic \nstability and sustainable high growth. The effect of the reforms will be an improved environment \nconducive  to  private  sector  investment.  The  program  will  help  achieve  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment objectives through the proposed reforms, which will help strengthen economic \nmanagement, facilitate better public financial management, support improved performance of \nSOEs,32 and create effective financial intermediation facilities. These reforms will primarily work \nthrough two channels: (i) there will be additional fiscal space to augment public investment with a \nmedium-term  focus  and  better  outcome  orientation,  and  the  improving  efficiency  of  public \ninvestment will have a crowding-in impact on private investment;33 and (ii) proposed policy \nreforms under the program will also make additional financial resources available for private \ninvestment. Improved economic management, and consequent macroeconomic stability, is an \nimportant driver of foreign direct investment. Augmenting private investment is essential to sustain \nhigh growth with additional job opportunities. \n \n15.  A programmatic approach is needed because the structural reforms require a long-term \nhorizon to be implemented effectively. Implementation of most of the proposed reforms must \nbegin with necessary changes in legal, institutional, and human resource structures. Judging \ncapacity constraints while designing the reforms is also important. Therefore, sequencing of \nreforms will remain critical. For example, introduction of an MTBF requires sufficient preparatory \nand implementation time. Similarly, introduction of an internal audit or CGRs will require a gradual \napproach starting with necessary changes in the business process. Thus, it is critical that the \nreforms are properly identified and sequenced over two subprograms. A programmatic approach \nis ideal for chronologically sequencing the reforms in a multiyear framework. It also enables \nalignment of policy actions with unavoidable realities and exogenous shocks. Moreover, the \nproposed modality plays a leveraging and catalyzing role in coordinating TA provided by the \ndevelopment partners. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n16.  While devaluations in 2017 probably increased some revenue receipts, such as value-\nadded tax, their overall impact on budget revenues was negative. At the same time, as indicated \nin para. 4, burden on the state exchequer increased as the government aimed to (i) mitigate the \nadverse impact of reforms on vulnerable groups; and (ii) ensure smooth functioning of strategic \nindustries, including SOEs, banks, and financial institutions. These additional expenditures and \nrevenue losses are summarized in Table 1. However, this resulted in a huge budget deficit of \nalmost 3.3% of GDP in 2017 (as against a deficit of 0.6% in 2016),34 including the balance of the \nFund  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  of  Uzbekistan.  The  augmented  fiscal  deficit  is \nexpected to be at around 1.3% of GDP in 2018.35 This signifies large development financing \n                                                \n32 Better service delivery by SOEs will also improve in parallel. \n33 Additional fiscal space will critically depend on, among others, the proposed MTBF-based budget allocations under \nsubprogram 2, supported by improved tax efforts. The program\u2019s support for PPP will also help to support private \nsector development. \n34 Table 1 in Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Approximately $1.5 billion combining 2017 and 2018 together. \n ", "8 \nneeds at the aggregate level. The government is currently in the midst of a comprehensive fiscal \nconsolidation exercise that aims at (i) additional revenue generation, and (ii) downsizing of public \nadministration while safeguarding macroeconomic stability and setting the stage for sustainable \nand higher growth. However, given the sluggish nature of revenue improvements over the short \nto medium term, the burden of fiscal consolidation will primarily fall on expenditure rationalization, \nespecially development expenditure. This is a clear illustration of a hard budget constraint and its \nimpact on development financing, given the downward rigidity in  nondiscretionary items of \nrecurrent expenditure (salary, pensions, and interest). Thus, it will be extremely difficult for the \ngovernment to incur additional costs to carry out its reform agenda, unless expenditures on \nspecific items are  protected and partly financed by development partners. The program is \nexpected to finance a portion of Uzbekistan\u2019s development financing needs.36 Thus, the program \nwill help the government to pursue its macroeconomic reform agenda without jeopardizing \nexpenditure on essential items. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Increases in Budget Expenditure Items and Revenue Losses  \n(2017\u20132018) \nItem  Cost \n($ million) \nSupport to banks for capital enhancement  643.7 \nSupport for price stabilization (including creation of a price stabilization fund)  542.6 \nLoss of revenue due to tax rationalization (including customs duties)  358.8 \nMoratorium on interest and principal payments during September 2017 and December  221.6 \n2018 in foreign currency loans of state-owned enterprises \nOne-time support to state-owned enterprises because of exchange rate liberalization   393.4 \nTotal  2,160.1 \nSource: Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Finance. \n \n17.  Based on the development financing requirements of the program, ADB will provide policy-\nbased loans (with a total amount of $600 million) to finance subprograms of $300 million each \nunder the programmatic approach. The ordinary capital resources loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement (ordinary \noperations). Based on the straight-line method, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there \nis no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The MOF will be the executing agency of the program. The CBU, the State Committee on \nStatistics, the State Committee for Assistance to Privatized Enterprises and Development of \nCompetition,  JSC  Uzbekenergo,  Ministry  of  Economy,  and  MOF  are  proposed  to  be  the \nimplementing agencies. The program director from MOF will supervise overall implementation \ncoordination across the various implementing agencies. The policy-based loan will be disbursed \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nThe  entire  program  will  be  implemented  over  30  months  (June  2017\u2013December  2019). \nSubprogram 1 completion is expected by July 2018 and that of subprogram 2 by December 2019. \n \n                                                \n36 The  government  will  also  mobilize  resources  from  domestic sources  and use  financial  support  from  other \ndevelopment partners to finance its development financing needs (para. 13). \n ", "9 \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n19.  An assessment of the institutional capacity was carried out for the program. It was agreed \nbetween the government and ADB that the TA for the Economic Management Improvement \nProgram will enhance capacity in the following areas to support implementation of proposed \nreforms under the programmatic approach:37 \n(i)  Medium-term budget framework. Support will be provided to prepare MTBF and \nimprove budget preparation and dissemination. \n(ii)  Public\u2013private partnership. Technical support will be provided to develop, select, \nand monitor PPP projects. Comprehensive training will be provided to the selected \nstaff. \n(iii)  Internal audit. The TA will help to strengthen the internal audit departments within \nthe selected ministries, including introduction of a risk-based audit manual. \n(iv)  Risk-based supervision and capital adequacy assessment. The TA will help \nthe CBU with improved monetary management, especially to carry out risk-based \nsupervision, capital adequacy assessments, and stress testing at regular intervals. \n(v)  JSC Uzbekenergo investment plan and fixed asset revaluation. The TA will \nhelp JSC Uzbekenergo to prepare a master plan for investment financing and fixed \nasset revaluation. \n(vi)  Gender sensitivity analysis. The TA will support an analysis of gender sensitivity \nof public expenditure programs and creation of a specialized sex-disaggregated \ndatabase for private enterprises. \n(vii)  Training and workshops. The TA will provide support for trainings and workshops \nin various departments (including the State Committee on Statistics). \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation \nand supplies, other logistical support, and other in-kind contributions.38 \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned to those of the programmatic \napproach.  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate \nconsultants; and procure goods (if necessary). The TA components will be monitored by the \nprogram director from MOF. A total of 65 person-months of consultancy services (international \nand national) will be required intermittently. Both individual consultants and a consulting firm will \nbe engaged. The consulting firm will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, to be selected and engaged by ADB in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nassociated project administration instructions and/or TA staff instructions. Output-based lump \nsum consulting contracts will be preferred for the firm and for the individual consultants. All \ndisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                \n37 The TA will help implement the policy actions proposed under subprogram 2, including those that are logically \nsequenced over two subprograms. \n38 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  Several outputs of the program have technical components at their core. Preparation, \nselection, and monitoring of PPP projects, to be supported under the program, will require strong \nfinancial and project management skills. Preparation of MTBF and linking them with actual budget \nallocations will require sound technical knowledge. Capacity building support under the program \nwill assist the relevant government departments to better manage these technical operations. \n \nB.  Economic \n \n23.  The program was subject to economic analysis, the results of which demonstrate that its \nbenefits considerably outweigh the costs. The key direct benefits considered are classified into \nthree groups: \n(i)  Higher public investment because of additional fiscal space attributed to (a) MTBF-\nbased budget making and improved internal controls, (b) reduced fiscal transfers \nto large SOEs over the medium term, and (c) savings from greater efficiency and \ncessation of systemic leakages. Fiscal space created under the program helps to \nenhance public investment.39 \n(ii)  Higher private investment because of improved financial intermediations, and \ncrowding-in attributed to higher public investment on infrastructure. Improved \nprivate investment in the state, in turn, will lead to higher growth and more \nemployment opportunities. \n(iii)  Better service delivery because of improved performance of SOEs. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was also explained to and \ndiscussed with the government. A governance risk assessment was conducted along the lines \nprescribed by the implementation guidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan.40 This assessment was complemented by a review of areas of possible risk and \nvulnerability in state financial management. The assessment found some risks that could affect \nthe proposed programmatic approach. They include risks related to (i) political support for reforms \nand ownership of the government, especially for sensitive reforms; and (ii) institutional dimensions \nof the proposed programmatic approach (e.g., weak capacity in the relevant institutions). The \nfinancial assessment found several areas of concern: (i) integration of capital and current budgets \nthrough proper planning, (ii) lack of alignment between sector goals and resource allocation, and \n(iii) fund-flow arrangements between MOF and off-budget funds for carrying out development \nprograms.41 While no major risks of mismanagement of resources at the executing level can be \ndiscerned, issues identified in internal controls, medium-term budget framework, institutional \ncapacity, and financial sustainability (especially for the PPP projects) are targeted for capacity \ndevelopment under the TA and policy changes under the loan. \n \n                                                \n39 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, the implementation of the program will adhere to ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy. \n41 On 18 December 2017, the government set up the Fund for Financing State Development Programs through \nResolution No. PP-3437. \n ", "11 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n25.  The poverty reduction and social impacts of the program are positive. The support for \naugmenting and sustaining development financing will have an impact on income poverty, \nespecially in a situation of rising inflation. The program\u2019s special emphasis on better expenditure \ntargeting through linking the MTBF with actual budget allocations is clearly geared toward \nprotecting the poor and other vulnerable groups. The program will aim to sustain macroeconomic \nstability and growth during the initial phase of the medium-term reforms through improvements \nmade to (i) funding of public and private activities, (ii) fiscal and financial management, and (iii) \nmanagement of SOEs and private sector participation. While these outcomes do not have a direct \nimpact on poverty reduction, the successful implementation of the policy actions under the \nproposed programmatic approach will facilitate higher productive public investment and higher \nbudget allocations for the social programs. Higher private investment, in turn, will create additional \njobs. Thus, it is expected that the program will have significant indirect benefits for the poor and \nvulnerable. The program will help maximize the benefits that improved corporate and sector \ngovernance can bring to SOEs in terms of economic efficiency and financial feasibility. This is \nexpected to improve access to public utilities. The program will also help the government to \nimprove its 2016 Gender Inequality Index ranking of 57, which was low in relation to some \nneighboring  countries.42 The  labor  force  participation  rate  is  also  low  for  females  (48.3%) \ncompared to males (76.2%).43 Thus, targeted expenditure on health under the MTBF and higher \nemployment opportunities in the private sector are expected to lift Uzbekistan\u2019s Gender Inequality \nIndex ranking. Rectifying these problems becomes more challenging if the government is unable \nto invest effectively (with improved targeting) and adequately in economic and social infrastructure, \neither  directly  or  through  partnerships  with  the  private  sector.44 Private  investment  is  also \nexpected, through the PPP projects, in areas covering school education and health service \ndelivery. This will also improve education and health indicators for women and children. The \nattached TA will analyze gender sensitivity of government expenditure programs and create a \nsex-disaggregated  database  of  private  enterprises  (primarily  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises).  This  gender  analysis  of  the  public  expenditure  programs  will  facilitate  the \nintroduction of an appropriate composition structure of the MTBF, which is a prerequisite for \nsignificantly improved gender targeting under subprogram 2. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Given the nature of the program, all three safeguard categories (environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples) are categorized as C under the policy-based loan. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.45 \n \n \n                                                \n42 The  Gender  Inequality  Index  reflects  gender-based  inequalities  in  three  dimensions:  reproductive  health, \nempowerment, and economic activity.
