THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), to be guaranteed by India, for the Demand-Side \nEnergy Efficiency Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will finance high-priority areas under EESL\u2019s demand-side energy efficiency \noperations under its energy service company (ESCO) business model.2 This includes the (i) use \nof more efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by municipalities for streetlights that could be \noperated  remotely;  (ii)  use  of  more  efficient  LED  bulbs,  tube  lights,  and  electric  fans  by \nhouseholds  and  institutions;  and  (iii)  promotion  of  more  energy-efficient  agricultural  water \npumps.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Energy efficiency approaches are the most cost competitive of the technology options to \nprovide better quality energy services. Upward projections for global economic growth by the \nWorld Bank4 and the emerging role of developing countries as a hub for industrial activities will \nincrease energy demand, and awareness of the need for greater efficiency in energy use is \ngrowing  worldwide\u2014even  more  so  in  developing  countries.  According  to  the  International \nEnergy Agency, developing Asia\u2019s share of worldwide energy-related carbon dioxide (CO ) \n2\nemissions more than doubled from 17% in 1990 to 39% in 2013. Without additional efforts to \ndecarbonize, developing Asia is expected to account for 46% of CO  emissions by 2030.5 These \n2\nprojections reflect Asia\u2019s increasing role as a center of manufacturing and home to over half of \nall global megacities, further exacerbating energy security and environmental constraints. A \nstronger emphasis on energy efficiency, both from the demand and supply side, is required, as \nwell as accelerated investments in renewable energy and in the deployment of advanced low-\ncarbon  technologies  to  reduce  local  air  pollution  that  causes  damage  to  health  and  the \nenvironment.  Given  that  India  is  already  one  of  the  world\u2019s  largest  and  fastest-growing \neconomies, low-carbon growth in India will have a great impact on the overall global situation. \n \n4.  India\u2019s economy has grown rapidly, with an average annual gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth rate of 7.2% since 2000, compared with an annual global GDP growth rate of \n2.6% in the same period. High economic growth is underpinned by increased energy use. The \ngovernment is ramping up its efforts to provide reliable electricity to close to 300 million people. \nAs a result, the total primary energy supply almost doubled from 441.3 million tons of oil \nequivalent in 2000 to 775.5 million tons of oil equivalent in 2013. Annual CO emissions from \n2 \nfuel combustion have grown even faster, from 892.0 million tons in 2000 to 1,868.2 million tons \nin 2013, as the fuel mix in India is largely based on fossil fuels.6 The potential for further \neconomic growth and rapid increase in energy demand in India is enormous. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ESCOs generally develop, design, build, and fund projects that save energy and recover their investment from their \ncustomers over time based on energy cost savings. (Refer to Supplementary Linked Document 14). \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Demand-\nSide Energy Efficiency Investment Project (TA 9081-IND) and will continue to provide technical support during \nproject implementation. \n4  World  Bank.  2016.

Key changes in policy priorities and investment strategies will be \nnecessary particularly in India, where rapid economic growth is coinciding with urbanization \nimpacts. Among the barriers to India realizing its full energy efficiency potential are (i) regulatory \nchallenges, as electricity is subsidized to some extent and energy efficiency programs are \nvoluntary; (ii) institutional challenges, as capacity to support the scaling up of energy efficiency \nis limited; (iii) financing challenges, as some energy-efficient technologies have high up-front \ncosts, but project sizes are small from a lender\u2019s perspective, and returns may be difficult to \nquantify; and (iv) limited understanding of energy-efficient technologies and associated benefits \nlimits its uptake. Delivering energy efficiency through third-party financing following an ESCO \ndelivery mechanism can help in scaling up the implementation of energy efficiency projects. \nHowever, ESCOs require support in accessing commercial finance and managing technical \nperformance  and  payment  security  risks.  Long  project  development  lead  times  and  high \ntransaction costs also affect their viability; thus, there is a need to support the demonstration of \na viable company that can contribute to transforming the market through various energy-efficient \ntechnologies using the ESCO business model, which can then be scaled up and replicated. \n \n6.  Alignment  with  government  priorities.  Against  regional  trends  for  growth  and  in \nrecognition  of  energy  efficiency  benefits,  large  emerging  economies,  including  India,  have \nlaunched initiatives resulting in significant energy efficiency improvements. The government has \ndetermined that increased end-use energy efficiency is critical for meeting India\u2019s rapid energy \ndemand growth. In 2015, the government pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP \nby  at  least  33%  below  2005  levels  by  2030 as  part  of  its  intended  nationally  determined \ncontributions to the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change.7 A recent \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  report  suggested  that  achieving  an  intermediate  target \nreduction of at least 20% in emissions intensity by 2020 would require investing approximately \n$68  billion  in  energy  efficiency  measures  in  India.8 Investments  in  energy  efficiency  are \nincreasingly being recognized by the government as the most cost-effective option (in the short \nto  medium  term)  to  reduce  energy  costs,  deliver  increased  economic  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness, increase energy security, and combat climate change. \n \n7.  Sector development plan. The government has recognized the need to achieve more \nsustainable low-carbon economic growth and has taken bold steps toward that end, including \nestablishing the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) as one of the eight \nmissions under India\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change, which the government unveiled \nin 2008. The NMEEE aims to strengthen the market for energy efficiency by creating conducive \nregulatory and policy regimes and has envisaged fostering innovative and sustainable business \nmodels for the energy efficiency segment of the energy sector. The NMEEE has launched four \ninitiatives to enhance energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries: Perform, Achieve and \nTrade  Scheme;  Market  Transformation  for  Energy  Efficiency;  Energy  Efficiency  Financing \nPlatform; and Framework for Energy Efficient Economic Development. Through these initiatives, \nthe NMEEE seeks to scale-up efforts to unlock the market for energy efficiency (estimated at \nRs740  billion)  and  help  achieve  total  avoided  capacity  addition  of  19,598  megawatts  and \ngreenhouse gas emissions reductions of 98.55 million tons per year at its full implementation \nstage. Until now, only about 5% of this potential has been tapped through the ESCO business \n                                                \n7  Government of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. 2015.

Same Energy, More Power: Accelerating Energy Efficiency in Asia. Manila. \n ", "3 \nmodel.9 The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) under the Ministry of Power (MOP) acts as the \nsecretariat  and  coordinating  agency  for  the  NMEEE.  EESL  will  support  BEE  in  the \nimplementation activities. \n \n8.  Borrower. EESL is a joint venture between four public sector undertakings of the MOP: \nNational Thermal Power Corporation, Powergrid Corporation of India Limited, Power Finance \nCorporation,  and  Rural  Electrification  Corporation.  EESL  was  established  in  2009  as  an \nimplementing arm of BEE, serving as an advisor, consultant, and ESCO implementing agency. \nAs an ESCO implementing agency, EESL administers projects and is paid back over time from \nthe resulting energy savings, thereby addressing the barrier imposed by the high up-front costs \nof energy efficiency projects to the long-term beneficiary. EESL has successfully implemented \nseveral projects. Consequently, demand for its ESCO services is growing rapidly throughout the \ncountry. To achieve the national goals and objectives articulated in the NMEEE, EESL has \ndeveloped a business plan and road map for 2015\u20132020, which includes plans for scaling up its \ninstitutional, technological, and financial capacity. EESL\u2019s board of directors and MOP have \napproved  the  business  plan.  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  and  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement have each approved credit lines of \u20ac50 million to EESL. EESL is \nalso talking to the World Bank and KfW for further investment support. \n \n9.  Project design. EESL\u2019s approach follows a standard process for each project, involving \ndetailed energy audits, an assessment of technology requirements, and pilot implementation in \nthe project area to establish performance benchmarks and to calculate energy savings. This \nforms the basis for the project scope and repayment terms, which are based on a deemed \nsavings approach.10 EESL then implements the projects and retains responsibility for asset \noperation and maintenance during the repayment period. \n \n10.  Rationale  for  sector  lending.  EESL\u2019s  investment  focus  is  on  efficient  municipal \nstreetlights, efficient domestic lighting and fans, and efficient agriculture pumps. Responding to \nthe  NMEEE,  the  business  plan set  ambitious  targets,  including  installing  about  4.5 million \nstreetlights, 700 million LED bulbs, and 6 million efficient agriculture pumps by 2020, which \nwould require an investment of more than $12 billion. EESL plans to mobilize the funds from \nvarious sources, including bilateral and multilateral agencies, domestic sources, and its own \nequity. EESL has a pipeline of subprojects in various stages of readiness for each of these \nimmediate  and  high-priority  investments.  A  sector  loan  financing  modality  is  considered \nappropriate for this project because there is a sector road map and capacity, and because it \nallows for the early implementation of subprojects with high readiness and the expansion of \ncoverage to include newer subprojects as they are developed, irrespective of physical location. \n \n11.  Core subprojects. Based on the available information, EESL and ADB have conducted \ndue diligence of sample core subprojects in Rajasthan for municipal streetlights and agriculture \npumps,  and  in  Maharashtra  for  household  lighting.  Potential  subprojects  have  also  been \nidentified in Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.11 EESL will ensure that all \nsubprojects contributing to the sector development plan are appraised, selected, and approved \nfollowing the subproject selection criteria and approval procedures in the project administration \n                                                \n9  Bureau of Energy Efficiency, National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency. https://beeindia.gov.in/content/ \nnmeee-1; and Energy Efficiency Services Limited. http://www.eeslindia.org/Home.aspx. \n10  A deemed savings approach involves an up-front estimation of energy savings that will be achieved from the \nproject, which is agreed by both parties and serves as the basis for annuity payments made during the project life. \n11 Subprojects from other eligible states may also be included subject to further due diligence and acceptance by \nADB following its eligibility requirements. \n ", "4 \nmanual (PAM), to the satisfaction of ADB. To be eligible for inclusion in the investment project, \neach candidate subproject will need to \n(i)  have a detailed project report completed in a format and to a level of detail that \nare acceptable to ADB; \n(ii)  have  all  necessary  counterparty  arrangements  agreed,  including  the \nimplementation schedule and repayment terms; \n(iii)  be scheduled for completion no later than December 2020; \n(iv)  yield a financial internal rate of return exceeding its weighted average cost of \ncapital, and an economic internal rate of return of at least 12%; \n(v)  meet category C of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009 for environment, \nindigenous people, and involuntary resettlement; and \n(vi)  use no funds from other bilateral and multilateral sources, unless complementary \narrangements are clearly agreed beforehand, to avoid duplication and double \ncounting. \n \n12.  Alignment with ADB priorities. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for \nIndia states that its focus on the energy sector will include energy efficiency.12 The project is \nalso aligned with the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020\u2019s priority of maintaining support for \nclimate change mitigation through investments in energy efficiency.13 ADB support for energy \nefficiency in India has largely focused on the supply; this would be ADB\u2019s first investment in \nIndia  targeting  demand-side  energy  efficiency  since  the  1994  loan  to  support  industrial \nefficiency.14 There is potential for follow-on loans for implementing additional energy efficiency \nprograms. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be an expanded market for energy-efficient technologies and reduced \nemissions  intensity  of  economy,15 aligned  with  the  NMEEE  and  India\u2019s  intended  nationally \ndetermined contributions to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (footnote 6 and \n8). The project\u2019s outcome will be increased end-use energy efficiency in the subproject areas. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The project will have three outputs: \n(i)  efficiency  of  street  lighting  in  one  or  more  municipalities  in  eligible  states \n(including Goa, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Telangana) enhanced by replacing \nthe  existing lights with LED lamps with a remote monitoring and control system; \n(ii)  efficiency of bulbs, tube lights, and electric fans in households and institutions in \nutility service areas in eligible states (including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, \nRajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh) enhanced by installing LED-based household and \ninstitution lighting and more efficient fans; and \n(iii)  efficiency of agricultural water pumps in utility service areas in eligible states \n(including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Rajasthan) improved \nby replacing old pumps with more efficient models that have a remote monitoring \nand control system. \n \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2013.

EESL\u2019s future growth path includes expanding its existing services and diversifying into \nnew energy market segments, such as smart grids and trigeneration (combined cooling, heat, \nand  power).  ADB,  together  with  the  UN  Environment  Programme,  is  supporting  EESL  in \ndeveloping a concept to test new technology options and business models and enter into \nenergy-efficient and high-impact business ventures. The Global Environment Facility approved \na project identification form in October 2015 to support the development of this concept. Once \nthe Global Environment Facility Council approves the final proposal with $14.3 million funding to \nbe administered by ADB, approval for additional cofinancing for this project will be processed, \nbut at a later time given different time lines for approval. Such additional cofinancing would \nenhance the scope of the project and not in any way impair the current proposal. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  The project\u2019s outputs will adopt proven energy-efficient technologies to reduce peak and \noff-peak demand on local and regional electricity networks in India. The technical specifications \nfor the energy-efficient equipment complies with BEE standards, including the energy efficiency \nstandards and labeling scheme for appliances, equipment, and lighting products. The procured \nequipment will come with adequate warranties complying with stringent technical specifications \nand  incorporating  international  best  practices.  Laboratory  testing  of  samples  of  procured \nequipment  will  be  undertaken  to  include  both  safety  and  equipment  life  parameters.  The \nintroduction of more efficient agricultural water pumps, LED-based streetlights, and households \nand  institutions  lighting  and  electric  fans  will  give  significant  energy  savings  (30%  from \nagricultural water pumps, about 80% from households and institutions LED lighting, and about \n                                                \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n50% from LED streetlights). The project\u2019s overall energy savings are expected to be around \n3,800 gigawatt-hours per annum, which is equivalent to the annual output of two 300-megawatt \ncoal-fired power stations. EESL has confirmed that equipment procured under the project will be \n(i) suitable for local conditions, taking into account issues such as reliability and the quality of \nelectricity supply and making sure the equipment can tolerate the sustained low voltages that \noften occur in India during peak demand periods; (ii) backed up by adequate performance \nguarantees from suppliers; and (iii) serviceable locally, especially agricultural water pumps. \nEESL\u2019s  post-installation  customer  service  procedures  to  support  maintenance,  external \nmeasurement, and verification arrangements and warranty compliance have been reviewed and \nare considered practical and appropriate. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The project will assist in institutionalizing energy efficiency in India\u2019s public sector and \nwill help demonstrate that energy efficiency is the least cost means to close the gap between \nelectricity demand and supply across the country. The project will benefit electricity consumers, \nprincipally domestic and agricultural consumers, as well as urban local bodies as a result of \nreduced expenditure on electricity. It will also allow electricity distribution companies to reduce \npurchases of expensive peak electricity and reduce the electricity subsidy burden on state \ngovernments. EESL will benefit financially through benefit-sharing agreements with end-users \nthat will allow EESL to recover its costs and earn a sustainable return on its investments. From \nan economic perspective, benefits accrue through incremental consumption of electricity during \npeak periods that is made possible because of the reduction in electricity used for lighting and \ndomestic fans, and resource cost savings because of the reduction in electricity used for water \npumping, street lighting, and households and institutions LED bulbs and electric fans outside of \npeak demand periods. The subproject economic internal rates of return are 35.2% (domestic \nLED  bulbs),  31.8%  (domestic  ceiling  fans),  43.9%  (agricultural  pumps),  and  14.5%  (LED \nstreetlights). Sensitivity analyses show that sample subprojects\u2019 economic benefits are stable \nagainst major risk factors. \n \n21.  The sample subprojects\u2019 financial internal rate of return to EESL, calculated on a real \npost-tax basis (and assuming no reflow of loan proceeds), is 2.7%\u20133.7% per annum, higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital of 2.2%. On this basis, the investment project is \nexpected to be economically viable and financially sustainable. In addition, analysis indicates \nthat the project would generate an even higher financial internal rate of return if subsequent \nreflows were considered. Although the ADB loan is for a 20-year tenor, the assets financed \nunder the project will be transferred to the beneficiaries within 1 year of supply for the domestic \nequipment component and after 7 years of supply for streetlights and agricultural water pumps. \nConsequently, the tenor of the ADB loan is substantially longer than the tenor of the cash \nreflows that EESL will receive through a transfer of assets. EESL will use such cash flows for \nsimilar subprojects until the ADB loan is repaid, which may widen the impact of the project. \n \n22.  EESL\u2019s  financial  performance  in  2013\u20132015  has  shown  exponential  growth,  with \nrevenue increasing from Rs145 million in FY2013 to Rs7.1 billion in FY2016, and post-tax \nreturns on equity increasing from 6% to 13%. While EESL has obtained an AA credit rating \n(indicating a high degree of financial stability) from two domestic credit rating agencies for its \nlong-term borrowing program, its plan to invest approximately Rs890 billion in 2017\u20132020 is \nvery ambitious and will be a challenge from the perspective of access to investment capital and \ninstitutional capacity. \n \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial management assessment. EESL has experience in accessing loans from \ndevelopment banks such as KfW and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, and has robust \nbudgeting and accounting systems in place, including policies and procedures with adequate \ninternal control systems. However, the overall financial management risk was assessed as \nmoderate  primarily  because  of  counterparty  risk  associated  with  Urban  Local  Bodies  and \nelectricity distribution companies, and the lack of a foreign exchange risk management strategy \nfor EESL. Measures proposed in the financial management action plan to address the various \nrisks include the establishment of (i) a foreign exchange risk management framework with \nspecific policies relating to hedging of foreign currency and interest rates; (ii) a framework for \nescrow account monitoring; (iii) a framework to protect project assets post-commissioning; and \n(iv) a program to build the capacity of EESL staff on areas such as program accounting; ADB \nreporting, and policies and procedures; and imprest account management. A detailed financial \nmanagement action plan is in the PAM, based on which the expected financial management \narrangements are expected to be satisfactory. \n \n24.  Project  procurement  risk  assessment.  EESL  has  a  well-developed  procurement \nsystem  and  a  procurement  policy  that  complies  with  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  General \nFinancial Rules, 2005. Its procurement department has experienced professionals who have \nextensive experience in delivering projects of a similar size and complexity using competitive \nbidding procedures. Per government guidelines for all procurements in excess of Rs500,000, \nEESL has adopted an e-procurement system that is compliant with the Information Technology \nAct, 2000. The existing procurement processes are governed by regulations that require robust \ndocumentation,  which  is  archived  electronically  in  established  information  management \nsystems. Existing information management systems are easily accessed and can provide data \nto  support  contract  negotiations,  dispute  resolutions,  and  required  audits.  EESL\u2019s  lack  of \nexperience with ADB-funded projects and international competitive bidding procedures will be \nmitigated  and  controlled  through  continuous  assistance  and  training  for  the  smooth \nimplementation of the procurement plans. ADB will also provide assistance in developing the \nstandard bidding documents to facilitate the smooth implementation of the procurement plans \nand conduct prior review for at least the first two procurement packages; all other procurement \npackages  would  be  subjected  to  a  post-review.  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time) will be used for any procurement of goods using ADB\u2019s loan \nproceeds. For the remaining procurement of goods and services for the project, EESL will follow \nits existing policies and rules to source the required mandated minimum procurement from \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and domestic manufacturers on an annual basis. \n \n25.  Institutional capacity assessment. EESL has in place a well-structured professional \nteam  with  clearly  defined  roles  and  responsibilities  for  efficient  and  effective  project \nmanagement. Transparent human resources and personnel management practices are adopted \nto achieve the project\u2019s desired objectives and EESL\u2019s vision and mission. In line with the \nprojected growth in business, EESL has been concurrently increasing its human resources from \nthe market, and has obtained MOP\u2019s approval to recruit adequate and talented professionals to \nmeet its rapid growth in ongoing programs and future projects. In addition to its staff, EESL will \noutsource some nonessential activities, as needed, to streamline project management and \nimplementation. EESL has a regular staff of 450 and is in the process of recruiting an additional \n100 in 2017. EESL appears to have the capability and capacity to successfully deliver multi-\nstakeholder projects and business opportunities in the energy efficiency markets, which is in line \nwith its business plan for 2015\u20132020. \n \n ", "9 \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and EESL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial  well-being  through  increased  access  to  energy-efficient  appliances  and  reduced \nelectricity consumption. Project beneficiaries are spread across the regions traversed by the \nproject. They will include agricultural, household, and institution consumers in selected states in \nIndia. People will benefit from (i) economic investment and growth, (ii) improvements in basic \ninfrastructure, and (iii) continued community support. A stakeholder communication strategy17 \nhas been prepared and includes end-user awareness programs in subproject areas that focus \non women\u2019s participation, gender sensitive training modules,  and the adoption and use of \nenergy efficient technologies. A gender action development framework has been prepared.18  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The project is classified environment category C. As required by ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  for  a  sector  loan,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  (EARF)  was  prepared  to  guide  EESL  in  subproject  selection,  screening  and \ncategorization, environmental assessment, and institutional arrangements. The EARF specifies \nthat  only  category  C  subprojects  according  to  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  will  be \nconsidered for funding. The project is expected to improve energy efficiency and reduce CO  \n2\nemissions with minimal environmental footprint by replacing streetlights, domestic lights, ceiling \nfans, and agricultural pumps with more energy-efficient units. These interventions will generate \nwaste, which will be collected, stored, transported, and disposed following the requirements and \nregulations  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Forest  and  Climate  Change.  EESL  and  its \ncontractors  will  adhere  to  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  national  environmental \nregulations in managing the waste that the project may generate. EESL will keep a record of the \ndisposed waste following the requirements of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate \nChange;  Central  Pollution  Control  Board;  and  State  Pollution  Control  Board,  including  the \nrelevant  permits  and/or  waste  destruction  certificates.  EESL  will  require  its  contractors  to \nestablish a grievance redress mechanism consistent with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and \nfollow the environment, health, and safety requirements of the guarantor, relevant state, and \nADB.  EESL  will  assign  staff  to  the  project  management  unit  to  (i)  manage  potential \nenvironmental  issues  and  compliance  with  the  EARF,  and  (ii)  monitor  the  compliance  of \ncontractors and implementing partners with environmental requirements. \n \n29.  Social. The project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples and will not have any impact. The project activities are not expected to cause any \nphysical or economic displacement nor will they require private land acquisition and government \nland transfer. The project will not have negative impacts on titled or nontitled holders, including \non indigenous peoples and their livelihood. A resettlement framework has been prepared for \nsubproject selection and implementation. The framework includes involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples checklists, and due diligence reports for the three sample project outputs to \nensure that the project will not have any negative impact on involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous  peoples.  Stakeholder  consultations  were  held  following  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and documented in due diligence reports. The loan agreement will include a standard \n                                                \n17  Stakeholder Communication Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Gender Action Development Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nassurance related to social safeguards, core labor standards for contractors (including equal \npay for equal types of work), and HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted disease prevention. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The risks are manageable, and appropriate \nmitigation measures are incorporated.
