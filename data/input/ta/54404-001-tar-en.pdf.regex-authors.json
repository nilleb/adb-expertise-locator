INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Department of \nEducation (DepEd) of the Philippines in operationalizing the Basic Education Learning Continuity \nPlan (LCP),1 which will enable students to continue learning through blended learning modalities \nduring the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.2 The TA will build the DepEd capacity and \nsupport distance education by developing content, training teachers, and piloting education \ntechnology (edtech) solutions to ensure that secondary school students3 have access to quality \neducation throughout school year (SY) 2020/21 and beyond.4 The pilot will use low-cost tablets \nto be connected to a local area network (LAN) supported by a solar-powered battery antenna, \nand target learners in selected school divisions. The content will be accessible nationwide through \nDepEd platforms. The TA responds to the request of the Government of the Philippines5 to \nsupport the continued learning of secondary school students from disadvantaged households that \nare enrolled in so-called \u201clast mile schools\u201d (LMSs).6  \n \n2.  The TA is not in the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022.7 It is aligned with the \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2018\u20132023  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the \nPhilippines, which supports broader access to quality secondary education.8 It will complement \nADB\u2019s Secondary Education Support Program, and the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino conditional \ncash transfer program, which provides education grants to poor households with children younger \nthan 18 years old.9 The TA is aligned with operational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities) and operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality) of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.10 It will contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 4 by protecting the \nbasic rights of thousands of students to quality education.11  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Like most countries, the Philippines has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. DepEd \nreopened  schools  on  5  October  2020  for  SY2020/21\u20144  months  later  than  usual\u2014after \nsuspending SY2019/20 on 15 March 2020. The President of the Philippines and the Inter-Agency \nTask Force instructed DepEd to open schools using distance education instead of face-to-face \nclasses  for  SY2020/21. 12  To  continue  providing  education  under  these  unprecedented \ncircumstances, DepEd developed the LCP in consultation with local government units, school \ndivision  offices,  academia,  the  private  sector,  civil  society  organizations,  and  development \n \n1  Government of the Philippines, DepEd. 2020. DepEd Order No. 12, s. 2020: Adoption of the Basic Education \nLearning Continuity Plan for School Year 2020-2021 in Light of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency. Pasig.  \n2  DepEd applies the term \u201cblended learning\u201d to a combination of distance education modalities using printed materials; \nonline education; and education based on television, radio, and/or education technology at home. \n3  Secondary education comprises junior high school (grades 7 to 10) and senior high school (grades 11 to 12). \n4  The school year (SY) in the Philippines generally begins in June and ends in March of the following year. \n5  In a letter dated 24 July 2020, the Department of Finance requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support \nDepEd in providing learning support kits for disadvantaged students and teachers. \n6  Government of the Philippines, DepEd. 2019.

Official Statement on the Opening of Classes. Pasig.  \n \n ", " \n2 \npartners. The LCP defines the most essential learning competencies (MELCs) per subject per \ngrade for SY2020/21, which were streamlined to cover about 40% of the kindergarten to grade \n12 (K\u201312) curriculum. It lays out a strategy for teaching and learning using blended learning \nmodalities. DepEd is developing self-learning modules based on the MELC that can be printed \nand distributed to, or downloaded by, the learners with complementary learning resources such \nas online materials, and/or television- and radio-based instructions. Financing the entire LCP will \nrequire an estimated budget of \u20b162.89 billion (about $1.29 billion). DepEd is facing challenges in \nbudget  and  technical  capacity,  especially  in  developing  the  self-learning  modules  and \ncomplementary learning resources for secondary education. \n \n4.  Low enrollment under the LCP and impact of lost learning opportunities. The rates \nof secondary school enrollment and completion had been improving steadily prior to the COVID-\n19 pandemic. The net enrollment rate in junior high school (JHS) had improved from 65% in \nSY2010/11 to 81% in SY2018/19, while the completion rate had risen from 75% to 89% over the \nsame period.13 However, as in many other countries, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to \nreverse some of these gains in the Philippines education sector.14 As of 26 October 2020, 25 \nmillion K\u201312 students had enrolled in public and private schools for SY2020/21, or just 90% of \nthe total K\u201312 enrollments in SY2019/20. The secondary education gross enrollment rate declined \nfrom 94% in SY2019/20 to 86% in SY2020/21. Regional disparities persist: the Bangsamoro \nAutonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao suffered the largest reduction in secondary education \nenrollment (41%). The negative impact on K\u201312 enrollment is larger in the National Capital Region \n(10%), Region III (11%), and Region IV-A (11%) than in other regions, which is associated with a \nmore significant contraction of the economy in these regions and the related adverse effect on \nhousehold incomes. Students from the poorest quintile are at high risk of dropping out of schools. \nThey may not be able to re-enroll because they do not have ready access to distance education \nand/or their families\u2019 economic situation has become particularly precarious. Available research \nsuggests that prolonged disruption in schooling and learning will have an adverse long-term \nimpact on affected students,15 and eventually on the youth joining the Philippine workforce. The \nloss in potential human capital because of low enrollment in basic education will have substantial \nlong-term social and economic implications for the Philippines.  \n \n5.  Learning  inequality  in  disadvantaged  areas.  Inequality  in  resources  and  facilities \npersist  for  schools  in  geographically  isolated  and  disadvantaged  areas.  DepEd  issued  a \nmemorandum prioritizing the advancement of LMSs in May 2019 to fill the learning gaps. In \nSY2018/19, a total of 1,573,360 K\u201312 students enrolled in 9,225 LMSs across all regions, except \nthe National Capital Region (footnote 6). These schools do not have access to internet, adequate \ntextbooks, the required teaching materials, or equipment. LMSs often provide multigrade teaching \nand are mostly more than 1 hour's travel distance away from a town center or are in difficult terrain. \nOver 3,500 LMSs lack access to reliable electricity. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, teachers \nand learners in LMSs were disadvantaged in terms of access to basic infrastructure, learning \nenvironment, and resources. Now, with distance education, they face even greater challenges \nsince they lack reliable access to electricity and the internet. Many LMS students do not have \n \n13  In SY2010/11, only 5 of 10 children of secondary school age in the poorest 20% of households were in JHS, \ncompared with 8 of 10 children in the richest 20% of households. In SY2017/18, 7 of 10 children of secondary school \nage in the poorest 20% of households were in JHS, compared with 9 of 10 children in the richest 20% of households.  \n14 The Philippines is the only country in Southeast Asia that has reopened schools based solely on distance education \n(i.e., no face-to-face classes). Other countries in the region have reopened schools with face-to-face classes, after \nputting in place required health, safety, and social distancing protocols; with the exception of Myanmar where schools \nhave been suspended altogether since August 2020 because of the increase in COVID-19 cases. \n15 E.

The government has \ntherefore called for a concerted effort to find suitable edtech solutions for these disadvantaged \nschools, teachers, and students. The DepEd office in the Sarangani province introduced a unique \nblended learning model using low-cost tablets connecting to a LAN supported by a solar-powered \nbattery  antenna.  This  solution  does  not  require  internet  connection  or  printing  and  allows \ncontinued learning.  \n  \n6.  Lack of skills and quality learning resources to support distance education. DepEd \nhas made significant efforts to train more than 850,000 teachers and school leaders for school \nreopening without face-to-face classes. It implemented three online teacher training courses\u2014\nmanagement of learning delivery modalities, learner welfare and well-being, and psychosocial \nsupport and training in wellness\u2014covering 90% of teachers nationwide. However, conducting \ndistance education full-time for all students and for a prolonged period is new and requires \ncontinuous support and upskilling as teachers, learners, and guardians encounter emerging \nchallenges. This rapid scale-up of distance education highlights the need to develop quality \nlearning resources that can be used with different learning modalities: online, audio, and visual. \nIt has also become clear that secondary education requires more relevant digital content for both \naudio and visual modes than elementary education does.16 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  opportunities  for  human  development \nequalized.17 The TA will have the following outcome: secondary education learning continuity \nstrengthened in the time of COVID-19.18 The achievement of the outcome will be determined by \nexamining the dropout rate and the mainstreaming of interactive, gender-, and indigenous people-\nresponsive content as proxies of quality education being provided in LMSs as a result of this TA\u2019s \noutputs. One of the most frequent reasons cited for dropping out of high school in the Philippines \nis lack of interest, which relates to low quality and relevance of education and makes these two \nindicators appropriate for strengthened education delivery.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  The TA will have three outputs, as outlined below and described in more detail in the terms \nof reference.19  \n \n9.  Output 1: Content for blended learning in secondary education developed. The TA \nwill recruit a consulting firm to develop interactive, gender-, and indigenous people-responsive \ndigital content for both audio and visual modes for secondary education, which are aligned with \nthe MELCs and K\u201312 curriculum. DepEd has defined the MELCs in each subject, so that students \ncan learn better with complementary learning resources. The TA will develop digital content that \ncovers at least 50% of MELCs in three prioritized core subjects\u2014mathematics, science, and \nEnglish\u2014for students of grades 7\u201312. It will also develop digital content for selected courses of \n \n16 Several development partners, including the Government of Australia, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), \nand United States Agency for International Development, have been supporting kindergarten and elementary \neducation.  \n17 Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

The  content  will  promote  interactive  and  individualized  learning  by \nincorporating gamification features to facilitate learning. The TA will enhance DepEd\u2019s learning \nmanagement system to analyze learners\u2019 behavior and assess the learning progress. The digital \ncontent will be used and tested in the pilot supported by output 2, targeting selected LMSs. The \npiloted  content  will  be  made  available  to  secondary  students  nationwide  through  DepEd \nCommons, an online platform for students and teachers that supports distance education. The \ndifferent modes and the content, once tested and validated, can also be adapted for use in ADB\u2019s \nother developing member countries. The TA will incorporate best practices on edtech solutions to \ndevelop the content.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Low-cost edtech solution for distance education piloted. The TA will \nconduct a pilot project using low-cost tablets and installing antennas to connect to LANs. These \nwill be supported by solar-powered batteries in selected LMS communities, where reliable \nelectricity access and internet connection are not available. DepEd\u2019s computerization program \nbefore COVID-19 provided at least one laptop or desktop computer to 93% of the schools. These \ncomputers will be used as servers for the pilot. ADB, in consultation with DepEd, will select \nparticipating school divisions and LMSs based on results from a rapid assessment supported \nunder ongoing ADB assistance.21 The rapid assessment team will validate DepEd\u2019s LMS dataset \nand collect additional school-specific information to select target LMSs and assess feasibility \nbased on certain criteria (e.g., school\u2019s commitment and contiguousness of households within the \nschool community). The TA will provide about 20 LAN sets, consisting of wi-fi antenna, solar panel, \ncables, and poles; and 3,000 tablets to secondary school students in 20 LMSs to support distance \neducation. Information technology officers from selected school divisions will work with the \nconsulting firm to install the LANs and will be responsible for their maintenance. The consulting \nfirm will monitor participating school divisions, and design baseline and end-line surveys to assess \nthe impact of edtech solutions on learning outcomes. The findings will be used to adjust any \nimplementation shortcomings prior to scaling up the pilot. Resulting lessons, including gender-\nspecific insights from the pilot, will be shared at knowledge sharing events and inform ensuing \nedtech projects in the Philippines and in other ADB developing member countries.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Technical expertise and training in sustaining blended learning provided. \nThe TA will support training for teachers and school leaders in sustaining student learning through \ndistance education in the medium and long term. This involves (i) using technologies for additional \ncontent development; (ii) supporting individualized learning for students; (iii) enhancing formative \nassessment of student learning; and (iv) transitioning students back to classroom teaching and \nlearning. The TA will produce several knowledge products to underpin DepEd's communication \nwith stakeholders and the presentation of lessons and best practices. These products will include \n(i) digital training tools for teachers and school leaders to manage blended learning; (ii) user-\nfriendly and inclusive guidance notes and social marketing tools for parents and guardians to \nsupport learning at home (e.g., radio-based communication for parents and guardians who are \nilliterate); and (iii) reports on the pilot using edtech in LMSs. All knowledge products will use \ngender-sensitive language and imagery. An external impact assessment of student learning by \nlearning modality will be done at the end of the TA activities.   \n \n \n20  Senior high schools in the Philippines offer four tracks for students to select: academic, technical-vocational-\nlivelihood, sports, and arts. About 40% of senior high school students were enrolled in the technical-vocational-\nlivelihood track in SY2019/20. \n21  ADB.
