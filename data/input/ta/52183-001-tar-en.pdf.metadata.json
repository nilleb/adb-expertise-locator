INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will (i) support Pacific developing \nmember countries (DMCs) in addressing the perennial challenges in improving the quality of \neducation through enhanced regionalism and mutually beneficial partnerships with regional \ninstitutions focused on the education priorities articulated in the Pacific Regional Education \nFramework (PACREF), 2019\u20132022;1 (ii) develop and expand access to a regional repository \nplatform and learning management platform for open, distance, and flexible learning (ODFL); and \n(iii) support small assessments, studies, and exchanges to expand knowledge development and \nprogram development in the region. \n \n2.  This TA is aligned with the operational priorities of the Strategy 2030 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; ADB\u2019s \nEducation by 2020: A Sector Operations Plan, which recognizes the need to emphasize the \nstrengthening of quality, inclusiveness, and relevant skills at all levels of education, while using \nnew and innovative models of service delivery and financing; the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 \nstrategic framework on supporting education and skills training to develop human capacity; and \nADB\u2019s Regional Operations Business Plan, 2019-2021.2 The TA contributes to Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 4 on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong \nlearning opportunities for all.3 It also supports a differentiated approach for small island developing \nstates. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Weak student learning outcomes. While Pacific DMCs have made significant progress \ntoward universal access to primary education, student learning outcomes remain poor. Results of \nthe 2015 Pacific Islands Literacy and Numeracy Assessment show modest improvements, but \ngreater effort is needed to strengthen learning as a foundational capacity that prepares young \npeople for further education and work. The proportion of Pacific students at or above the expected \nproficiency level in numeracy is 86% for year 4 and 68% for year 6, which suggests improvement \nover the 2012 baseline of 74% for year 4 and 56%, for year 6. 4  However, the  2015 assessment \nshowed no overall increase for literacy over the 2012 baseline; the proportion of students at or \nabove the expected proficiency level was 46% for both year 4 and year 6 students compared with \n43.29% for year 4 and 48.39 for year 6% (footnote 4). \n \n4.  Constraints. Despite an emphasis on quality improvement strategies in many DMCs, \nimproving the quality of education remains a challenge. Several constraints that impact quality \ninclude  economic, geographic,  and  political  constraints;  high  staff turnover;  coordination  of \ncomplimentary activities; capacity and accountability constraints on teachers and education \nmanagers;  data  collection  and  analysis  constraints;  social  constraints,  including  gender \n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2014.

Suva. \n ", "2 \ninequality; and constraints relating to the language of instruction given that the Pacific is home to \nsome of the greatest linguistic diversity in the world.5  In terms of gender inequality, female \nenrollment exceeds male enrollment in all Pacific countries, except for Papua New Guinea.  \nAcross the region, gender gaps are more likely to favor girls, particularly in Kiribati and Tuvalu, \nwhere the gender parity index for secondary school is 130.6  The 2015 administration of the Pacific \nIslands Literacy and Numeracy Assessment revealed that on average year 6 boys performed at \na similar level to year 4 girls across the region in literacy (footnote 4). \n \n5.  Opportunities. Several factors have contributed to progress against these challenges, \nincluding commitment by governments to development goals; partnerships at all levels, including \nthose between DMCs and development partners; regional cooperation through high-level forums \nand  regional  institutions;  increasing  demand  for  a  qualified  workforce;  integrated  national \neducation planning and budgeting; school-based improvement initiatives; curriculum reform; and \nnational policies for early childhood (footnote 5). Technology is increasingly viewed as an \nimportant facilitator to strengthening education delivery in the region. \n \n6.  Pacific-based solutions. Pacific DMCs face challenges related to their remoteness, \ndispersion, and small economies, which make them vulnerable to climate change risks and \nshocks.  Leveraging  economies  of  scale  to  create  and  share  Pacific solutions  can  provide \nsignificant and accelerated opportunities to improve the quality of education in the region. \nStrengthened regional mechanisms that encourage coordination and collaboration among Pacific \nregional institutions during planning and implementation are essential to ensure that limited \nfinancial resources are deployed efficiently and effectively. At the 50th Annual Meeting of the ADB \nBoard of Governors, Pacific governors requested more Pacific-based solutions, underlining the \nimportance of learning between DMCs, and the use of Pacific institutions and consultants. \n \n7.  Pacific  Regional  Education  Framework  support  for  regionalism.  The  PACREF \n(footnote 1) outlines the region\u2019s shared priorities for education and training for 2019\u20132022, while \nalso responding appropriately to global and regional demands. The four key policy areas identified \nby countries are (i) providing high-quality, relevant programs at all education levels; (ii) meeting \nlearners\u2019 needs through a broad range of programs and delivery modalities; (iii) achieving the full \npotential of learners at all education levels, from early childhood education to skills development; \nand (iv) supporting and empowering the teaching profession through opportunities for continuous \nprofessional learning, shared understanding, and accountability. The PACREF development \nbegan in 2016 under a participatory process involving a working group of the Pacific Heads of \nEducation Systems, chaired by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and funded by Global \nPartnership for Education with ADB as the grant agent. It ensures continued Pacific country \nownership. Development partners will pool and coordinate funding under the framework to \nsupport a group of identified regional institutions in coordinating delivery of agreed priority regional \ngoods and services under the framework. \n \n8.  Technology as a facilitator to achieving education goals. Access to quality and \nrelevant learning content for the Pacific region is a longstanding issue. Progress has been made\u2014\ndevelopment partners such as ADB and New Zealand have pilot-testing e-learning resources\u2014 \nand the potential usefulness of a regional platform to better promote ODFL and a learning \nmanagement platform is clear. 7 ADB has experience in Samoa, where it supported English, math, \n                                                \n5  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. 2015.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: inclusive and equitable quality education \nensured and lifelong learning opportunities for all promoted (footnote 3). The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: regional capacity to improve education outcomes in the Pacific enhanced.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Pacific Regional Education Framework implementation supported. The \nTA will fund the PACREF implementation plan for phase 1 (2019\u20132022).10 It will finance identified \nregional institutions that are delivering priority goods and services deemed essential to Pacific \neducational systems. The approach builds regional institutional capacity while also strengthening \ncoordination and collaboration across countries receiving services. The TA provides a vehicle for \nexpanding PACREF support beyond ADB\u2019s own resources as cofinancing becomes available. A \nstrong monitoring, evaluation, and learning component including sex-disaggregated data will be \ntied to the PACREF to ensure ongoing research and learning in designing education activities \nthat improve gender equality in completion rates, learning outcomes, school-to-work transitions, \nand access to quality jobs. In addition, learning between DMCs will be emphasized, based on the \nrequest of Pacific DMCs. The PACREF outlines key policy objectives, goals, and intended \noutcomes and priority strategies that were determined by the Pacific Heads of Education Systems \nsmall working group and approved by the Pacific Islands Forum Education Ministers\u2019 Meeting in \nMay 2018. The four key policy areas identified are (i) quality and relevance, (ii) learning pathways, \n(iii) student outcomes and well-being, and (iv) the teaching profession. Key outcomes and \nstrategies are outlined in the PACREF, and an implementation plan details the regional institutions \nresponsible for specific activity areas. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Regional  repository  and  learning  management  platform  for  open, \ndistance, and flexible learning established. In light of the small economies of Pacific DMCs, it \nis strategic to establish a regional center to develop e-learning resources and provide curatorial \nservices with appropriate human resources and technical facilities in the Pacific (footnote 6). The \nTA will support contextualized teaching and learning resources for the Pacific, including adapting \nopen education resources to the Pacific. It will support a regional center to develop, collect, and \ncoordinate the interchange of e-resources between Pacific countries, and will be organized \nregionally to leverage economies of scale and support national e-learning resource repositories. \nThe TA will support a strategic opportunity for ADB and New Zealand to collaborate on scaling up \nODFL regionally. The initial focus for the regional repository will be on developing e-resources for \nprimary and secondary education learning, particularly literacy but also math, sciences, with a \nfocus on supporting girls to pursue science and math, and interdisciplinary areas relevant to the \nPacific context. The repository will allow for country-level customization and will be demand-\ndriven. The TA will build on key regional institutions, including the University of the South Pacific\u2019s \nSchool of Education for its ability to influence teacher education regionally, and its Centre for \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2007.

Output  3:  Small  assessments,  studies,  and  exchanges  to  expand  knowledge \ndevelopment and program development supported. The TA will support assessments and \nstudies to expand knowledge development and exchange within the region. Possible studies and \nassessments include country-focused implementation of priority education and skills development \nareas, gender, pre-feasibility work for pipeline education investments in Pacific DMCs, and \nthematic analyses outside the PACREF that warrant further understanding or lead to new \ninvestment opportunities. The TA will also support participants in regional or subregional events \nand training programs where this can expand the scope of ADB\u2019s activities. \n \n13.  Through the outputs, the TA will contribute to enhanced regional capacity to improve \neducation by supporting implementation of the PACREF and establishing a regional repository \nand learning management platform for open, distance and flexible learning.  The TA will provide \ncross-country support for capacity development and knowledge generation. It will also offer a \nplatform for policy dialogue with countries to discuss critical needs for investment in education \nand to showcase ADB\u2019s engagement in the sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. The executing agency will be the Pacific Department of ADB, \nand implementing agencies will be the Forum of Education Ministries. The University of the South \nPacific, as the Chair of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific for human resource \ndevelopment, will serve as an implementing partner of the implementing agencies.
