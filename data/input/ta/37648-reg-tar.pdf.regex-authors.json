The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  since  2001  supported  the  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program, which was launched at the request of \nthe South Asian Growth Quadrangle, formed by Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal (BBIN) \nthrough two regional technical assistance (RETA) projects.1 SASEC working groups have been \nestablished  in  six  priority  sectors:  transport;  tourism;  trade,  investment,  and  private  sector \ncooperation; energy and power; environment; and information and communications technology \n(ICT).  \n \n2.  The  overall  progress  of  the  SASEC  program  has  been  generally  good,  despite  its \nrelatively short history. This is particularly true in the areas of improving subregional transport \nconnectivity, promoting regional tourism, enhancing private sector cooperation, and helping \nestablish ICT connectivity. Four loan projects amounting to $383.3 million and 14 technical \nassistance (TA) projects totaling to $6.7 million have been approved for projects identified under \nthe SASEC program.  \n \n3.  The SASEC program was initiated at a time when limited progress was being made in \nregional cooperation under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation2 (SAARC). \nOver the past 2 years, the environment for regional cooperation in South Asia has significantly \nimproved. Prospects for region-wide cooperation under the SAARC framework are better now \nas the results of the 12th SAARC Summit held in Islamabad in January 2004 and the 13th \nSAARC Summit held in Dhaka in November 2005, and the associated improvements in political \nrelations within the region. At the same time, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral \nTechnical and Economic Cooperation3 (BIMSTEC) has emerged as an important cross-regional \ncooperative initiative joining countries in South Asia and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). \n \n4.  Against this backdrop, the SASEC Country Advisors\u2019 Meeting4 (CAM) was held in Manila \non 22-23 July 2005 to wrap-up the activities under SASEC Phases I and II and to discuss the \nfuture direction of SASEC. Noting the importance of regional and cross-regional cooperation to \nsocial  and  economic  development,  BBIN  at  CAM  reaffirmed  their  strong  commitments  to \ncontinue the SASEC program, with its project- and program-based subregional cooperation, as \nan effective complement to broader efforts toward regional and cross-regional cooperation \nthrough  SAARC  and  BIMSTEC.  CAM  also  agreed  that  membership  in  the  sector  working \ngroups will be made flexible to include other countries in the subregion.  \n \n5.  Building upon the progress of SASEC Phases I and II, following the agreements made at \nthe CAM, and in line with ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy for South Asia, the TA for SASEC \nPhase III5 (Phase III) will continue to support and strengthen subregional cooperation in South \nAsia. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Bhutan and \nNepal became members of BIMSTEC in February 2004. All SASEC member countries are now also members of \nBIMSTEC. At the first BIMSTEC Summit held in July 2004, a program for economic cooperation was set out in six \nsectors: trade and investment, energy, tourism, transport and communications, technology, and fisheries. \n4   Country advisors comprise the secretaries and joint secretaries of the Ministry of Finance of SASEC countries. \nCAM was attended by the country advisors and the chairpersons of the six sector working groups. \n5   First appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 31 May 2004. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  The SASEC subregion, comprising BBIN, is one of the largest concentrations of the poor \nin the world, reflecting a high incidence of poverty in Bangladesh, Nepal, and India\u2019s eastern \nand northeastern states.6 The subregion has a population of about 1.16 billion people (18.4% of \nthe world population and 92.8% of the South Asian population) and a gross domestic product \ntotaling $543 billion (1.7% of the world product and 86.5% of the South Asian product). The \nSASEC subregion has great potential for economic development, as it is endowed with rich \nnatural and human resources as well as a rich historical heritage and vibrant and varied culture. \nThe subregion shares borders with Myanmar and the People\u2019s Republic of China, which provide \ngateways to Southeast Asia and the wider East Asian region. While the SASEC subregion has \nachieved strong growth, averaging 5.7% between 2000 and 2004\u2014one of the highest growth \nrates  in  the  world\u2014the  region  has  yet  to  reach  its  full  potential.  Subregional  economic \ncooperation, by helping to eliminate physical and other barriers and ensuring a more optimum \nuse of resources, is one important way to help the subregion realize its potential.  \n \n7.  During Phase I and II, in addition to helping build mutual trust and confidence among \nBBIN, the SASEC program has assisted BBIN in setting the goal and objectives of each working \ngroup; identifying and prioritizing subregional projects; and supporting the implementation of \npriority projects.7 In particular, the six major corridors8 identified under the SASEC program will \nimprove subregional connectivity in terms of physical conditions and operational efficiency. \nRegional tourism on the two themes of ecotourism and Buddhist circuits, which started to gain \nmomentum with strong commitment from both the public and private sector, has created new \nopportunities in tourism and the service sector. Removing trade and non-trade barriers identified \nunder  the  SASEC  program  will  facilitate  the  movement  of  goods  and  attract  increased \ninvestment  from  both  within  and  outside  the  region.  Establishing  regional  ICT  connectivity \namong BBIN will contribute to reducing the cost of communication and enhancing the efficiency \nof doing business in the subregion. Through cooperation, rich indigenous energy resources in \nthe subregion can be harnessed and supplied more efficiently to the benefit of both energy-rich \nand energy-deficient countries. Built on such progress and in view of unexplored potential \nbenefits, implementing the priority projects needs to be further accelerated during Phase III. In \naddition,  reflecting  the  more  favorable  environment  for  regional  cooperation,  the  SASEC \nprogram will broaden the geographical areas to explore greater potential benefits, including the \nother South Asian countries, as well as the GMS countries during Phase III. \n \n8.  Like  most  ADB-assisted  subregional  cooperative  programs,  the  SASEC  program \nfocuses  primarily  on  project-based  cooperative  activities.  A  subregional  and  project-based \napproach  provides  a  practical  and  effective  means  of  facilitating  regional  cooperation, \nparticularly when it is at a relatively early stage. This makes possible producing tangible results \nin a short time period, which in turn helps to further strengthen the process of cooperation \namong the participating countries.  \n \n9.  Subregional  cooperative  activities can  also  act  as  building  blocks to  wider  regional \nintegration. The successful implementation of subregional projects and programs shows the \nbenefits  that  can  be  realized  through  cooperation  and,  by  demonstration,  encourage  the \n                                                 \n6  Khanna, Sushil. 2001.

At the same time, project-based subregional cooperative activities can complement \nand  supplement  broader  regional  cooperative  initiatives  agreed  under  existing  regional \ncooperation forums such as SAARC and BIMSTEC. \n \n10.   Noting the progress made to date and a strong commitment to continue the SASEC \nprogram,  CAM  agreed  on  a  number  of  measures  to  further  strengthen  the  program  and \nenhance its role in supporting regional cooperation in the future:  \n \n(i)   There  should  be  a  greater  focus  on  results  in  terms  of  implementing  more \ntangible projects and outputs, moving beyond the study phase and into specific \ninvestments.9  \n(ii)   More interaction and cooperation need to take place between the SASEC sector \nworking groups to maximize the synergy of the cooperative activities.10  \n(iii)   An effective mechanism needs to be developed to facilitate closer coordination \nand cooperation among SASEC, SAARC, and BIMSTEC.  \n(iv)   Membership in the working groups should be open to other neighboring countries \nif this is seen as mutually beneficial to all the parties involved.11 \n(v)  To further strengthen country\u2019s ownership, the desirability of the participating \ncountries\u2019  taking  more  proactive  role  in  the  SASEC  activities  is  noted.  The \nparticipation  of  other  stakeholders,  including  private  sector  and  other \ndevelopment partners, also needs to be further encouraged to strengthen policy \ndialogues for cooperation and to mobilize more resources in the SASEC projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The overall goal of TA is to accelerate pro-poor economic growth in the South Asian \ncountries participating in the SASEC program through subregional cooperation, and thereby \nachieve poverty reduction in the subregion. The main purpose of TA is to identify and prioritize \nsubregional projects primarily within BBIN but also with other South Asian countries and with \nGMS countries in close coordination and cooperation with SAARC and BIMSTEC.  \n \n12.  TA will (i) provide a forum for effective dialogue and interaction among the participating \ncountries, the private sector, and development partners to further deepen mutual understanding \nand trust for subregional cooperation; (ii) develop background and issue papers and conduct \npre-feasibility studies for identifying and prioritizing subregional projects;12 and (iii) support the \nworking groups in implementing the agreed priority projects and activities through discussion \nand coordination at SASEC meetings.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  TA will organize regular SASEC meetings of the country advisors and sector working \ngroups, with joint or back-to-back sector working group meetings to maximize synergies among \n                                                 \n9   While the need for \u201cadditionality\u201d and \u201cconcessionality\u201d of ADB\u2019s lending for regional cooperation projects was also \nThraei sveide wats  CeAxMpr,e thsisse ids  bheeirnegi nd iascreu stsheods ein  othf eth ceo nctoenxts oufl ttahnet  daenvde ldopom neont t noef cAeDsBs\u2019asr inlye wre opvreersaell nstt rtahtoegsye  oonf  AreDgiBon\u2019sa l \nmceomopbeerrast,i oBno aanrdd  inotfe Dgriareticotno. rs, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n10 For example, the transport working group and the trade, investment, and private sector cooperation working group \ncan work together for the development of subregional transport infrastructure and the associated agreements on \nprocedures and documentation. \n11 The tourism working group has invited Sri Lanka to be a new member of the working group. \n12 Prefeasibility studies are for projects to be newly identified, and feasibility studies are for implementing the projects \nand programs.  \n ", "4   \nthe activities of the working groups. TA will also support identifying and prioritizing projects \nconcerning countries in both South Asia and GMS, particularly aiming for enhanced connectivity \nin transport and ICT, and tourism development. This can be facilitated by organizing meetings \nbetween the SASEC working groups and similar working groups under BIMSTEC and SAARC, \nas well as other selected meetings, workshops, and forums, to encourage interaction and \nstrengthen synergies among SASEC, BIMSTEC, and SAARC.  \n \n14.  TA will engage national, regional, and international consultants to provide technical, \nadvisory, and administrative support services to facilitate discussions for identifying projects \namong the participating countries in the SASEC program. A core group of consultants includes \na senior TA advisor, two regional cooperation specialists, and sector experts.  \n \n15.  TA will disseminate information related to subregional cooperative activities to increase \nawareness  of  the  SASEC  program  among  all  stakeholders  and  facilitate  more  active \nparticipation of stakeholders in SASEC activities. SASEC publications, including a quarterly \nSASEC newsletter and consultant reports, will be prepared and circulated. The SASEC website \n(www.adb.org/sasec) will continue to be maintained and updated.  \n \n16.  TA will promote the following particular activities in each sector. \n  \n  (i)   The transport working group will focus on (a) upgrading the six priority corridors \n(see  para.  7  and  footnote  7),  (b)  improving  the  trade  logistics  system,  (c) \nextending the physical link between BBIN and GMS through BIMSTEC, and (d) \nstrengthening the institutional capacity of the agencies and private sector entities \ninvolved in transport development.  \n  (ii)   The tourism working group will continue to promote regional tourism based on \nthe  ADB-assisted  Tourism  Development  Plan  study,  in  cooperation  with \nBIMSTEC. Public\u2013private partnerships and establishing a funding mechanism for \nthe private sector projects identified in the plan will be further explored.  \n  (iii)   The trade, investment, and private sector cooperation working group will focus on \ntrade facilitation measures to be recommended in separate studies.13 Working \ngroup activities will be designed to supplement existing work on regional and \nglobal trade agreements made under the World Trade Organization, SAARC, \nand BIMSTEC. The activities of South Asia Business Forum (SABF)14 will be \nstrengthened  to  promote  more  active  private  sector  participation  in  SASEC \nactivities. To further facilitate foreign and regional investments in the region, \nparticularly in the identified SASEC projects, investors\u2019 forum(s) will be organized \nduring Phase III. \n  (iv)  The ICT working group will focus on implementing the programs and projects \nrecommended by the ADB-assisted SASEC ICT Development Master Plan study \nand the Community e-Centers project.  \n  (v)  In view of continued sensitivities and complexities in dealing with cross-border \nenvironmental  issues,  the  environment  working  group  will  focus  primarily  on \ninformation sharing, capacity development, and knowledge-based management, \nrather than on developing cross-border projects.  \n  (vi)  The energy and power working group will identify the most effective way of taking \ncooperation forward reflecting the improving environment for cooperation15 in this \n                                                 \n13  These are (i) mutual recognition of manufacturing processes; (ii) towards sharing common facilities in the SASEC \nregion; (iii) simplification of customs procedures and harmonization of trade documents; and (iv) affirmative action \nfor landlocked countries. \n14   SABF was established in 2002 comprising the chambers of commerce and industries of the SASEC countries. \n15   The importance of energy sector cooperation was highlighted at the 13th SAARC Summit. Particularly, the need to \nconstitute a South Asian Energy Dialogue process involving all stakeholders, was underlined. \n ", "     5\nsector.  Possible  areas  of  cooperation  include  capacity  development  and  the \npromotion of regional trade in electricity and gas.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA cost is estimated at $1 million and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB is the Executing Agency, and TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months \nstarting  on  1  January  2006.  The  regional  cooperation  unit  of  the  Operations  Coordination \nDivision (SAOC) of the South Asia Department (SARD) will be the division responsible for \noverall TA administration, including the activities of the SASEC Secretariat already established \nunder the SASEC Phase I and II. Designated sector focal persons from relevant SARD sector \ndivisions will assist the respective working groups in identifying and implementing regional \nprojects  and/or  programs.  These  focal  persons  and  the  staff  of  both  the  SAOC  regional \ncooperation unit and the respective resident missions will form a SASEC team, which will \noversee overall implementation of the SASEC program. For matters related to BIMSTEC, SAOC \nwill work in close coordination and cooperation with the Mekong Department (MKRD). \n \n19.  The secretaries of the ministries of finance from the participating countries will be the \ncountry  advisors  and  provide  overall  supervision  of  TA,  in  charge  of  coordination  in  their \ncountry. Each sector working group will be represented by the secretaries of the line ministries \nof the participating countries and will provide technical inputs for TA implementation. The chair \ncountries of the working groups designated under SASEC Phase I and II will continue to preside \nover their respective working groups and take a lead role in designing and facilitating the \nactivities of the sector concerned. They are the secretaries of (i) Bangladesh for energy and \npower;  (ii)  Bhutan  for  environment;  (iii)  India  for  trade,  investment,  and  private  sector \ncooperation, and ICT; and (iv) Nepal for transport and tourism. The sector chair will also take \nthe  lead  in  interactions  with  other  sector  working  group  members.  ADB  will  support  the \nparticipation of appropriate representatives of SAARC and BIMSTEC in SASEC working group \nmeetings as well as the participation of the SASEC representatives in the selected SAARC and \nBIMSTEC  meetings.  An  organization  chart  showing  the  implementation  arrangements  is \npresented in Appendix 4. \n \n20.
