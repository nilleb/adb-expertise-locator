INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In  November  2001,  the  six  member  countries  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \n(GMS)\u2014Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014agreed on a 10 year GMS strategic framework \n(GMS-SF). The GMS-SF embodies the vision of the GMS Program for Economic Cooperation \n(GMS Program), which is a subregion that is more integrated, prosperous, and equitable. During \nthe GMS summit held in Phnom Penh on 3 November 2002, the leaders of the six GMS \nmember  countries  strongly  endorsed  the  GMS-SF,  its  strategic  thrusts,  and  its  flagship \nprograms. The facilitation of cross-border movement of goods and people is a key element of \nthe GMS-SF. During the Seventh Meeting of the GMS Subregional Transport Forum in Ho Chi \nMinh City, Viet Nam, and the 11th GMS Ministerial Conference in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the \nGMS countries agreed on a work program to negotiate, finalize, and sign the annexes and \nprotocols of the Agreement for Facilitation of the Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People \nin the Greater Mekong Subregion (Cross-Border Agreement) by 2005,1 and requested the \ncontinued  assistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  this  regard.  The  technical \nassistance (TA) will help finalize and implement the Cross-Border Agreement and its annexes \nand  protocols,  which  have  been  developed  under  previous  TAs.2  The  TA  framework  is \npresented in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since its inception in 1992, the ADB-supported GMS Program has achieved significant \nprogress. High-priority transport corridors are being built and are expected to be completed in \n2004\u20132007. These include the (i) Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project;4 (ii) GMS: \nCambodia Road Improvement Project;5 (iii) East-West Transport Corridor Project, linking Lao \nPDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam;6 and (iv) the North-South Transport Corridor Project linking \nYunnan Province of the PRC, Lao PDR, and Thailand.7 As these physical subregional linkages \nare  developed  and  as  the  GMS  members  open  their  economies  to  free  trade,  the  GMS \ngovernments have increasingly recognized the need to address regulatory and institutional \nissues  in  order  to  ensure  efficient  flow  of  goods  and  people  across  international  borders. \nNonphysical barriers to efficient movement include, among other things, (i) restrictions on the \n                                                 \n1  Agreement Between and Among the Governments of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Kingdom of Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for \nFacilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People. \n2  ADB. 1997.

Since 1996, ADB has been helping to mitigate nonphysical barriers to the efficient flow \nof goods and people across borders in the GMS. As a result, the GMS governments have \ndeveloped a basic framework incorporating the principles of (i) bilateral or multilateral action to \nreduce nonphysical impediments to cross-border transport, and (ii) flexibility in recognition of \ndifferences in development and procedures in each of the GMS countries. Developed along the \nlines  of  this  framework,  the  Trilateral  Cross-Border  Agreement  between  and  among  the \ngovernments of the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, to facilitate cross-border transport of \ngoods and people, was signed on 26 November 1999. Subsequently, on 29 November 2001, \nthe government of Cambodia acceded to this agreement, and the government of the PRC \nacceded to it on 3 November 2002. The government of Myanmar is considering to accede to the \nagreement, although the date of the accession is not yet determined. Detailed annexes and \nprotocols  to  implement  the  agreement  have  been  prepared,  with  ADB  assistance.  These \nannexes and protocols are scheduled to be negotiated and finalized during 2003\u20132005. Related \nto this, ADB is also assisting the GMS countries in pilot testing single-stop customs inspection at \nselected border crossings.8 The agreement and its annexes and protocols have been designed \nto complement similar agreements of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and \nto be consistent with applicable international conventions. GMS ministers have agreed that the \nagreement and its annexes and protocols will be signed by 2005.  \n \n4.  The implementation of cross-border facilitation measures will help GMS countries realize \nthe economic benefits of GMS transport corridors that will soon be completed. With improved \nsubregional road infrastructure, full implementation of the Cross-Border Agreement will result in \nfreer movement of goods and people in the GMS starting from 2006, thereby creating a more \nfavorable environment for cross-border trade, investment, and tourism. This, in turn, will help \npromote economic integration, sustainable economic growth in the GMS, and reduce poverty, \nespecially in the border areas.  \n \n5.  Considerable work is required to negotiate, finalize, and implement the Cross-Border \nAgreement and its annexes and protocols. This will involve a complex process, requiring close \ncoordination  among  the  participating  governments,  and,  within  each  country,  coordination \namong officials in at least 10 ministries and agencies. Assistance in building the capacity of \nGMS officials is also necessary, and is urgently requested in (i) formulating national positions, \nand  (ii)  negotiating  and  implementing  the  agreement  and  its  annexes  and  protocols.  Full \nimplementation of the agreement and all its annexes and protocols will thus require a significant \namount of time and resources. Since GMS road corridors will be completed during 2004-2007, \ncritical facilitation measures contained in some articles of the agreement and some key annexes \nand protocols, which will assure efficient cross-border flows of goods and people, will have to be \nimplemented by these dates. Thus, ADB assistance in implementing the agreement and its \nannexes and protocols will best be provided through a phased approach, with Phase 1 focusing \non the first-priority facilitation measures contained in some agreement articles, annexes, and \nprotocols.  A  phase  2  of  ADB  TA  on  cross-border  facilitation  in  the  GMS,  planned  for \nimplementation  in  2005\u20132006,  will  focus  on  the  remaining  annexes  and  protocols,  and \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n6.  The purpose of the TA is to help finalize and implement the Cross-Border Agreement \nand  its  annexes  and  protocols.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  assist  the  GMS  governments  in \n(i) negotiations and signature of a set of critical annexes and protocols to the agreement, and \n(ii) implementation of critical cross-border transport facilitation measures at border crossings to \nbe agreed upon.  \n \n7.  The expected outputs of the TA are (i) a set of signed key annexes and protocols, \n(ii) GMS officials who are adequately trained in key aspects of cross-border transport facilitation, \nand (iii) guidelines and manuals for key cross-border transport facilitation measures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  A basic requirement to bring the Cross-Border Agreement into force is its ratification by \nall signatory governments. Accordingly, the TA will provide requested assistance to the GMS \ngovernments to facilitate the ratification process, including consultations with GMS governments \nto clarify aspects of the agreement and its impacts in order to expedite ratification.  \n \n9.  The TA will support the negotiations of a set of key annexes and protocols (Appendix 3, \npara. 4). This will involve assistance to (i) the joint committee established by the Cross-Border \nAgreement,9 including support for negotiating meetings and consultations to help prepare for \nnegotiation meetings,  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  joint  committee;  and  (ii) the  national \ntransport  facilitation  committees  (NTFCs)9  in  individual  countries  for  preparations  for  the \nnegotiation meetings.  \n \n10.  The  TA  will  also  support  the  conduct  of  workshops,  seminars,  and  other  training \nactivities on cross-border transport facilitation to be attended by GMS officials concerned. These \nactivities may be held in collaboration with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission \nfor Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \n(UNECE). The activities will be designed to enhance the understanding of GMS officials on \nrelevant international conventions and best practices with a view to preparing them to negotiate, \nfinalize, and implement the Cross-Border Agreement and its annexes and protocols. Training \nwill also be conducted to help strengthen the NTFCs and the joint committee by familiarizing \nmembers with the process of trade negotiations using past regional and multilateral agreements \nas examples. \n                                                 \n9  As called for by Article 28 of the Cross-Border Agreement, NTFCs chaired by a minister or vice minister in each \ncountry, will bring together representatives of all parties concerned with the implementation of the agreement. As \ncalled for by Article 29 of the agreement, a joint committee of the NTFCs will serve as a platform for discussion, \nnegotiation, and implementation of the agreement and its annexes and protocols. The work of the joint committee \nwill be under the umbrella of the GMS Ministerial Conference established as part of the ADB-assisted GMS \nProgram. ", "4 \n \n11.  The TA will also support implementation of critical cross-border transport facilitation \nmeasures  at  agreed-upon  border  crossings.  This  will  include  provision  of  support  for  the \nincorporation of the agreement into domestic law of the signatory countries. Such support will \ninclude technical translation into the local languages as well as provision of advisory opinions by \ninternational and domestic legal experts. Furthermore, the TA will support the preparation of \nguidelines and manuals for implementing critical cross-border facilitation measures. For this \npurpose, consultations will be made with organizations and agencies responsible for related \ninternational conventions and agreements, such as UNECE, UNESCAP, and World Customs \nOrganization (WCO). \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $860,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $800,000 \nequivalent to finance the cost of international and domestic consultants, and costs associated \nwith meetings. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan is given in Appendix 2. The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The participating governments \nwill provide the remaining $60,000 equivalent in kind, in the form of counterpart staff as well as \nlogistical and interpretation/translation support. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s GMS Unit will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A coordination team within \nADB\u2019s GMS Unit will serve as a secretariat to support and guide TA implementation. The \nNTFCs in the six GMS countries will serve as focal points for the TA implementation. The joint \ncommittee of the NTFCs will monitor TA implementation. \n \n14.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants to be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A core team comprising the team leader and \ntransport regulations specialist (international) will, among other things, participate in missions \nand single-country and multi-country meetings. The core team consultants who were engaged \nin the previous two TAs, will be directly selected due to (i) their general expertise in the legal \nand  regulatory  aspects  of  cross-border  transport,  including  the  drafting  and  negotiation  of \ninternational agreements; (ii) their specific knowledge of the Cross-Border Agreement and draft \nannexes and protocols; (iii) their satisfactory performance in the previous two TAs; (iv) the trust \nand respect they have earned from GMS government officials concerned; and (v) the tight \nschedule  involved.10  The  other  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individuals  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Domestic consultants will also be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Approximately \n12 person-months of international and 30 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired,  comprising  a  team  leader  (4  person-months,  international),  transport  regulations \nspecialists  (3  person-months,  international;  14  person-months,  domestic),  and  other  cross-\nborder specialists, possibly including regional economists, legal specialists, customs specialists, \nand transport economists (5 person-months, international, and 16 person-months, domestic; to \nbe specified as required by the negotiations among the GMS countries). The outline terms of \n                                                 \n10 Due to the tight schedule required to assure implementation of critical agreement articles, annexes, and protocols \nbefore the completion of ADB-assisted GMS transport corridors, the time required for selection of a new firm, and \nmore importantly, the lengthy time period required for a new firm to become familiar with the history and issues of \ndevelopments in facilitating the cross-border transport of goods and people in the GMS is not available. ", "    5 \nreference are given in Appendix 3. To facilitate preparations for negotiations and finalization of \nthe critical annexes and protocols, communications, computer, and printing equipment will be \nprocured  for  the  NTFC  offices  in  each  participating  country,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  Procurement  and  other  such  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nprocurement of equipment. After completion of the TA, ownership of the equipment purchased \nunder the TA will be transferred from ADB to the six participating governments pursuant to \nADB\u2019s Project Administration Instruction 5.11, section 10. \n \n15.  The  GMS  Unit  will  develop  a  system  for  monitoring,  updating,  and  disseminating \ninformation and developments on cross-border facilitation activities. This system will include the \nestablishment of a library of cross-border agreements and related issues, preparation of a \nregular newsletter on GMS cross-border facilitation, and inclusion of a section on GMS cross-\nborder facilitation in ADB\u2019s GMS website. Official summaries of proceedings of the meetings \nheld under the TA will be posted on ADB\u2019s GMS website (www.adb.org/gms). ADB\u2019s GMS Unit \nwill report the outcome of TA activities during subregional transport forum meetings, GMS \nsenior officials\u2019 meetings and GMS ministerial conferences. As called for in Article 29 of the \nGMS Cross-Border Agreement, the joint committee, which the TA will support, will monitor and \nassess the functioning of the agreement.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of about 22 months, from March 2003 to \nDecember 2004. By the end of 2004, the following are to be accomplished: (i) a signed set of \ncritical annexes and protocols; and (ii) completed implementation-related activities, such as the \npreparation  of  detailed  manuals  and  guidelines,  for  some  critical  Agreement  articles  and \nannexes and protocols. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nImplementing  the  Agreement  for  Facilitation  of  the  Cross-Border  Transport  of  Goods  and \nPeople in the Greater Mekong Subregion-Phase 1, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1
