A summary of the environmental impact assessment \nwas  circulated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and made public through the ADB \nwebsite on 4 July 2009. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is located in Anhui Province, one of the poorest \nareas in the PRC. Its per capita gross domestic product was 64% \nof the national average in 2007; the province ranked 27th among \nthe country\u2019s 31 administrative areas. The Project is designed to \npromote inclusive growth and balanced development in Anhui, \nand  improve  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to an integrated road transport system \nin Anhui by (i) constructing a 139-kilometer (km) expressway and \nassociated  facilities  between  Xuzhou  and  Mingguang; \n(ii) upgrading, rehabilitating, and providing safety measures on \n452 km of existing local roads; (iii) improving village bus services \nin poorer areas; and (iv) providing institutional strengthening and \ncapacity  building  for  the  Anhui  Provincial  Department  of \nTransport  (APDOT),  its  related  agencies,  and  Anhui \nCommunications Investment Group Company Limited (ACIG). \n   \nRationale  The  underdeveloped  transport  system  and  associated  high \ntransportation costs are major barriers to poverty reduction in \nAnhui.  Rural  poverty  incidence  is  high  in  the  project  area, \nparticularly in Huaibei Plain in the north and Dabie Mountain area \nin the south. Lower transportation costs and enhanced transport \nsector management will promote inter- and intraprovincial trade, \nencourage  investment  in  the  project  area,  create  jobs,  and \nincrease competitiveness. \n \n  The Project will contribute to ADB's country partnership strategy \nfor the PRC (2008\u20132010). It will help (i) improve connectivity, \ncompetitiveness, and balanced development in Anhui; (ii) reduce \npoverty by expanding affordable access to markets, services, \nand other job opportunities to the poor; and (iii) manage resource \nscarcity  and  environmental  challenges  by  improving  transport \nplanning, environmental supervision, and resource optimization. \n \n ", "ii \n  The  Project  reflects  ADB\u2019s  transport  sector  strategy,  which \nfocuses on (i) financing new roads that connect major growth \ncenters, supported by a system of local roads; (ii) developing and \nimproving urban transport and rural roads; (iii) promoting road \nsafety,  (iv)  reducing  vehicle  emissions  and  increasing  energy \nefficiency;  (v)  improving  the  commercial  orientation  and \nefficiency  of  expressway  organizations;  and  (vi) promoting \nsustainable transport.  \n \n  The Project is accorded priority in the Government's 11th Five-\nYear Plan, and forms an integral part of the planned network \nformulated under the Government's central region development \nstrategy.  It  will  strengthen  regional  integration  and \ncompetitiveness  of  Anhui.  It  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s \ndevelopment  priorities  to  reduce  regional  disparities  between \ninland and coastal regions, and between rural and urban areas.  \n \n  The Project will enhance transport sector management in Anhui. \nIt will (i) contribute to an integrated transport network across the \nprovince;  (ii)  initiate  a  comprehensive  safety  enhancement \nprogram to mitigate the accident risks associated with the project \nroad improvement program; (iii) integrate a village bus services \ndemonstration  project  to  foster  better,  safer,  and  more \nresponsive bus services in rural areas; (iv) promote resource \noptimization; and (v) improve environment, health, and safety \nmanagement  by  appointing  an  independent  environmental \nsupervision team during implementation. \n \n  Through the Project, ADB is supporting APDOT in building its \ncapacity  for  sound  public  policy  choice  and  implementation. \nDuring project preparation, ADB provided advice on the merit of \nvarious project alternatives and this helped APDOT to improve \nthe design of the Project. ADB helped APDOT update policies \nand services to deliver transport in an economically, financially, \nenvironmentally, and socially sustainable manner. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will contribute to an integrated road transport system \nto support the Central Region Development Strategy. This will be \nachieved  by  developing  an  efficient,  affordable,  safe,  and \nsustainable transport system to promote inclusive growth and \nbalanced  development,  and  improve  resource  efficiency  and \nenvironmental sustainability. \n \nProject Investment Plan   The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $1,355.0 \nmillion,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $45.7  million.  Of  the \n$200.0 million ADB loan, $118.5 million will finance the project \nexpressway  component,  $80.0  million  will  finance  the  local \nroads,  safety,  and  village  bus  services  demonstration \ncomponents;  and  $1.5 million  will  finance  the  institutional \nstrengthening component. \n ", "  iii \n   \nFinancing Plan  Amount \nSource  ($ million) \nAsian Development Bank   200.0 \nDomestic Bank Loans  598.8 \nMinistry of Transport   119.1 \nAnhui Communications Investment Group   \n  Company Limited  320.9 \nAnhui Provincial People\u2019s Government   116.2 \n    Total 1,355.0\n    \n  A loan of $200,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the Loan and Project \nAgreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  by  the \nTerms  Government  of  the  PRC  to  the  Anhui  Provincial  People's \nGovernment (APG) on the same terms and conditions as the \nADB  loan.  APG  will  onlend  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  APDOT. \nAPDOT will utilize $81.5 million for the local roads, safety, and \nvillage bus services demonstration components and institutional \nstrengthening. APDOT will further onlend $118.5 million to ACIG \non the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan. APG and ACIG will bear the interest rate variation and \nforeign exchange risks.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  30 June 2015 \n   \nExecuting Agency  Anhui Provincial Department of Transport (APDOT) \n   \nImplementation  APDOT, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall \nArrangements  implementation of the Project. The existing Foreign Fund Project \nManagement  Office  (PMO)  established  within  APDOT  will  be \nresponsible for overall project implementation. Within APDOT, \nthe project activities will be coordinated by three implementing \nagencies:  ACIG,  Anhui  Highway  Administration  Bureau,  and \nAnhui Transportation Administration Bureau, under the overall \ndirection  of  the  PMO.  APDOT,  through  the  PMO,  will  be \nresponsible for implementation of institutional development and \ncapacity building. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and works financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Contracts and mode of procurement \n ", "iv \nenvisaged under the Project are indicated in the procurement plan. \nPrior  review  will  be  applied  for  all  international  competitive \nbidding  contracts  and  the  first  national  competitive  bidding \ncontract for works and goods, and post review for other national \ncompetitive bidding and shopping contracts. On 21 July 2009, \nADB approved advance contracting and retroactive financing for \neligible expenditures not exceeding $40 million. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  20  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services to provide advice on road safety, road asset \nmanagement,  village  bus  services,  and  environmental \nmanagement. The international consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  also  finance  national  consulting  services  for \n(i) village  bus  services  demonstration  project  supervision; \n(ii) local road traffic safety program supervision; and (iii) a road \nsector financing and maintenance study, each at an estimated \ncost  of  no  more  than  $100,000.  The  required  national \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. In addition, APDOT will engage and \nfinance 6,000 person-months of national consulting services. All \nnational consultants, not financed by ADB, will be recruited in \naccordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project is one of the high-priority projects identified by the \nBeneficiaries  Central Region Development Strategy. It will have a significant \nimpact on economic development and poverty reduction in the \ncentral and western regions. \n \n  The  Project  will  help  reduce  inter-  and  intraprovincial \ndevelopment disparities to promote harmonized and coordinated \ndevelopment. Specifically, it will provide an efficient, safe, and \nsustainable road transport system in Anhui to (i) reduce transport \ntime and costs, and thereby promote inter- and intraprovincial \ntrade  and  reduce  regional  development  gaps;  (ii)  encourage \ninvestment in the project area, create jobs, and increase incomes \nfor  the  poor;  (iii)  reduce  vehicle  emissions,  traffic  noise,  and \ntraffic accident rates; (iv) improve public transport services and \nquality of life for rural poor, and (v) strengthen sector planning \nand development capacity. \n \n  The Project will reduce transport time and costs. It will facilitate \nlocal urbanization, allow industry to be more economically viable \nalong the transport corridor, add value to agriculture products \nthrough  better  market  access,  and  improve  access  to  social \nservices including education and health care. \n \n ", "  v \n  The Project will reduce fuel consumption, improve transportation \nconditions, shorten travel time, and improve safety. It will help \nreduce vehicle emissions, congestion, traffic noise, and traffic \naccident rates. \n \n  The Project will benefit 4 million people in 14 counties, of which \nsix counties  are  officially  designated  poverty  counties. \nSpecifically,  as  a  result  of  the  project  transport  corridor \nimprovement, two poor counties in the northeast of the province \nwill gain improved accessibility, with better connections to major \nmarket centers and to development opportunities in neighboring \nJiangsu Province. \n \n  A  substantial  local  road  network  will  be  improved,  through \nselective upgrading and rehabilitation of damaged roads, so as \nto serve the mobility needs of local communities. It will better \nintegrate poor and underdeveloped counties into the provincial \neconomy. \n \n  The  Project  will  assist  APG  to  better  manage  the  major \nchallenges in the transport sector, notably through application of \nroad  safety  good  practices,  introduction  of  rural  village  bus \nservice reforms, and preparation of recommendations for a road \nmaintenance  financing  framework  to  ensure  sustainable  road \nmaintenance. \n \n  The  Project  is  economically  and  financially  justified.  The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is estimated at \n15.8%. The financial internal rate of return for the expressway \ncomponent  is  6.6%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real  weighted \naverage cost of capital. \n \n  The Project will directly benefit road users (e.g., passengers, \ntraders, transport providers, and bus and truck operators), as \nwell as labor, the local economy, and the private sector. Rural \nhouseholds  will  be  important  beneficiaries\u2014from  increased \nincomes through better access to roads, services, markets, jobs, \nand other off-farm opportunities. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Overall, the project risk is rated low. The Project is formulated to \nreduce financial, safety, and social risks. These were assessed \nand mitigating measures provided. \n \n ", "vi \n  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  The \nproject design considered potential financial and social risks. All \nlocal roads under the Project will be toll free. A financial analysis \nwas conducted of provincial revenues, including availability of \nsufficient  counterpart  funds,  the  future  maintenance  and \noperating  expenses,  as  well  as  the  loan  repayments.  This \nreveals that the fiscal impact and financial risks of the Project are \nlow. Social issues include land acquisition and resettlement, road \nsafety,  and  prevention  of  transmissible  diseases.  Appropriate \nmitigation measures are in place in the resettlement plans, road \nand  traffic  management  designs,  and  disease  prevention \nawareness program. \n \n  The  risk  of  implementation  delays  in  timely  approvals  of  the \nrecommended regulatory changes of the village bus licensing \nsystem  is  addressed  by  establishing  a  project  development \ngroup in each county to act as an implementing unit. The project \ndevelopment  group  will  have  authority  to  recommend \nimplementation of regulatory changes. Consulting services will \nbe  provided  during  implementation  to  develop  and  agree  on \nnecessary  procedures  and  documentation.  Training  programs \nwill be designed for bus operators and regulators to train them in \nthe new procedures. ADB will continue dialogue with APG and \nthe Ministry of Transport. Any problems will be identified, and \nadjustments  made  where  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  new \nsystem works effectively.  \n \n  APDOT has experience and has shown satisfactory performance \nin  implementing  internationally  financed  projects.  The \npreparation team worked closely with APDOT to ensure that the \npolicy and institutional improvement activities are of value to the \nAPDOT. \n \n ", "116o  00'E 118 o 00'E Trunk Highway Network\nSHANDONG in the Corridor \nANHUI INTEGRATED TRANSPORT Lianyungang\nXuzhou\nSECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT 34 o 00'N Suqian 34 o 00'N\nIN THE Huai\u2019an Yellow  Sea\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA J I A N G S U\nBengbu\nS H A N D O N G Mingguang\nNanjing\nHefei Shanghai\nXuzhou Wuhu SHANGHAI\nA  N  H  U  I\n34 o 00'N Huaibei Minxian 34 o 00'N\nX056 118 o 00'E Hangzhou\n1\nBozhou\nSuzhou Shantou 119o  00'E\nGroup 1:\nLingbi Northeast Road Network\nH  E  N  A  N Sixian\nGuzhen\nXiaowei Bus Terminal\nS304\n2\nBengbu Wuhe Xuyi\nFuyang J  I  A  N  G  S  U\n3\nMingguang\nHuainan S309 Tianchang\nS312\n4\nDingyuan to Yangzhou\nN\nChuzhou\nA  N  H  U  I\nNANJING\n0 20 40 60 80\nHEFEI\nKilometers Longtang\n5 S105 Maanshan\nLu'an\nGroup 2:\nHeishidu Shucheng Chaohu Industrial Corridors\nChao Lake\nDaoshichong Lujiang Wuhu\n6ZhS31o8ngjieling Tongc7heng (Ya n gtze R.)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Anhui Integrated Transport Sector Improvement \nProject. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Inclusive Growth and Balanced Development \n \n2.  The PRC has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction since the late 1970s. \nHowever, it still has the second largest number of consumption poor in the world. In 2005, it still \nhad 254 million people consuming less than $1.25 a day (in 2005 purchasing power parity \ndollars).1 Poverty is more widespread in the central and western region. Income inequality has \nincreased significantly, and disparities remain and in some cases have grown. The task of \npoverty reduction continues. Government policy has been rapidly evolving in response to the \nchallenges, and a broader poverty reduction agenda has been taking shape. In particular, \ninclusive growth and balanced regional development are emphasized as the long-term national \ndevelopment  strategy  to  close  the  widening  development  gap  between  inland  and  coastal \nprovinces, and between rural and urban areas. \n \n3.  Anhui Province has a population of 66.8 million\u201461% are classified as rural, higher than \nthe national average of 55%. The population density of 470 people per square kilometer is \nsignificantly higher than the national average of 138. With per capita gross domestic product at \n64% of the national average in 2007, Anhui ranked 27th among the country\u2019s 31 administrative \nareas.  It  has  19  officially  designated  national  poverty  counties  and  10  provincial  poverty \ncounties, accounting for 47.5% of the counties in the province. In 2007, the annual per capita \nnet income of rural households was CNY3,556, while the annual per capita disposable income \nof urban households was CNY11,473, three times more than that of rural households. Rural \nincome poverty incidence is 10.5%.2 Poverty and urban\u2013rural disparity are the two major issues. \nInadequate road infrastructure and associated high transport costs are major barriers to the \nreduction of poverty and disparity in Anhui. \n \n4.  Despite its strategic location, Anhui is the least developed province in central PRC. \nPoverty in Anhui is concentrated in Huaibei Plain in the north and Dabie Mountain area in the \nsouth. Huaibei Plain is a major grain production area; however it is flood-prone, which limits \nintensification of farming. The main causes of poverty in Huaibei Plain are high population \ndensity and limited nonfarm employment, which results in a large surplus of rural laborers. \nBecause of its remoteness and isolation, the resources and income-generating opportunities of \nthe Dabie Mountain area are limited. Lack of transport accessibility and connectivity constrain \nsocioeconomic development of the northern and southern mountainous areas. \n \n5.  Provinces  along  the  coastline  have  benefited  from  logistical  accessibility  and  well-\ndeveloped infrastructure, thereby growing more quickly than the central and western regions. \nThe central region grew at a slower pace than the rest of the PRC in the 1990s. Aware of the \nimportance of coordinated and harmonized development between eastern, central, and western \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2009. From Poor Areas to Poor People: China\u2019s Evolving Poverty Reduction Agenda. Washington, \nDC.  \n2  Rural income poverty incidence in Anhui is much higher than in eastern neighboring provinces (1%\u20132%) and \nwestern and southern neighboring ones (5.0%\u20138.6%). \n ", "2 \nprovinces,  the  Government  formulated  the  Central  Region  Development  Strategy  in  2004. \nTransport is one of the high priorities of the strategy. A well-developed transport network will \nhelp the central region capitalize on its strategic location and transform it into a major hub \nlinking east and west, and north and south. Anhui is a key central region province and is well \nlocated to benefit from the strategy and spillover effects from neighboring coastal provinces. \n \n6.  The  Anhui  Provincial  People's  Government  (APG)  put  forward  its  own  strategy  of \nDevelopment to the East, aiming to promote links with the more affluent eastern provinces \n(Jiangsu and Zhejiang) to reduce regional development gaps. The strategy assigns high priority \nto eastward transport development as a way to narrow the widening regional development \ngaps by increasing passenger and freight movements with eastern provinces, and attracting \nmore investment to Anhui. It will also link passenger and freight movements from western \nprovinces to eastern provinces. \n \n2.  The Road Subsector \n \n7.  Since  1998,  the  PRC  has  invested  about  5%  of  its  gross  domestic  product  in  the \ntransport sector, 65% of which was for roads. The growth of road assets has exceeded the \ngrowth rate of the economy; this has helped bridge the country's infrastructure gap.3 Overall, \ntransport investments have been a constant factor in fostering and spreading growth from the \neastern to the inland regions of the PRC, and facilitating poverty reduction. Development of the \nnational transport networks has been accompanied by continuing development of the secondary \nand tertiary transport networks to provide improved connectivity and quality of access. From \n1990 to 2006, during the period of the 8th, 9th, and 10th five-year plans, the PRC completed the \nconstruction of nearly 44,000 kilometers (km) of high-grade tolled expressways. During that \nperiod, about 400,000 km of local and rural roads were also improved. \n \n8.  Anhui, with a land area of 139,400 square kilometers, is a landlocked province in central \nPRC. Roads are the main transport mode.4 Between 2003 and 2007, transport demand in Anhui \ngrew at 8.5% per annum (8.4% for freight and 8.8% for passengers). All modes of transport \nhave experienced rapid growth in demand. Roads now carry most of the passengers (64% of \npassenger-km in 2007), while railways and inland waterways are the preferred modes for freight \ntransport, especially for long-haul bulk goods. Road transport plays an essential role in the \ncollection and distribution system (roads were used to collect and distribute 75% of cargo \ntonnage in 2007). Increasing demand for mobility and accessibility will require upgrading of \ninfrastructure capacity as is reflected in long-term plans. The sector's policy and institutional \ndevelopment also needs to be strengthened to respond to changing and growing demand. \n \n9.  The province's road network is relatively dense but only provides low levels of service to \nthe population. The total length of roads per capita is in line with the national average. However, \nthe capacity and quality of the roads in Anhui is inadequate. As of 2007, the length of (i) main \nhighways (class II or above) was 12,392 km (8.4%), lower than the national average of 10.6%; \nand (ii) arterial roads (class I) was 360 km; only 44% of the network is paved. The network also \nhas an unbalanced geographic distribution. In particular, the densely populated poor northern \ncounties and the mountainous areas in the south have only limited access to the highway \nnetworks. This lack of transport accessibility prevents a considerable portion of the population \nfrom fully benefiting from the region's ongoing development. \n                                                 \n3 The \"infrastructure gap\u201d is the difference between the existing asset base and the asset base required by the \neconomy. \n4  In 2007, Anhui had 5,600 km of navigable waterways, 2,400 km of railways, and 148,000 km of roads. The modal \nsplit for passenger-km was 63.8% for roads, 36.1% for railways, 0.1% for inland waterways. The modal split for \nfreight ton-km was 50.1% for railways, 27.3% for roads, and 22.6% for inland waterways. \n ", "3 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges and Opportunities \n \n10.  The national fuel taxation reform has been fully applied in Anhui Province since early \n2009. Six categories of fees levied on drivers were abolished, including an annual tax computed \nby the number of seats per car and a surcharge on passengers and freight carried by boats. \nTolls on class II roads were also removed in pilot provinces including Anhui. In their place, the \ncentral Government has introduced a national fuel surcharge of CNY0.8 per liter for diesel and \nCNY1.0 per liter for gasoline since 1 January 2009. This will bring the pricing system for roads \ncloser to a pay-as-you-go mechanism. The additional fuel tax revenues are being used in part to \nmaintain and manage roads and waterways, and to help compensate local governments for lost \nincome from eliminated tolls and fees. It is an efficient mechanism to collect road user fees, and \nprovides an incentive to lower fuel consumption and promote vehicle fuel efficiency. It will bring \nlong-term gains to the financial and environmental sustainability of the road transport system. \nAs the central Government collects the fuel tax, proper distribution channels and mechanisms \nare essential for allocating these tax revenues to the transport sector to ensure that funding is \navailable for maintenance of the road network and debt servicing for class II roads. This reform \nwill profoundly transform the financing framework of the sector, and enhance the transparency \nand accountability of road administrations.  \n \n11.  Road safety remains a major issue in the PRC, with 73,500 fatalities reported in 2008 \n(down from 100,000 in 2000). Road accidents are the second leading cause of premature death \nin the PRC, and the leading cause of death in the 15\u201345 year age group. A road accident can \ntake  a  family  from  self-sufficiency  to  poverty,  especially  if  the  victim  is  the  family\u2019s  main \nbreadwinner.  Reducing  threats  to  life  and  health  is  therefore  accorded  high  priority.  The \nintroduction of the National Road Safety Law in 2004 encouraged a greater focus on road safety, \nand required the setting up of provincial road safety committees. The road safety situation has \nimproved steadily but remains challenging as motorization increases. Practices and policies \nmust be improved to reduce the number of fatalities and severity of injuries on the roads. \n \n12.  In 2008, more than 8,400 reported traffic accidents claimed 3,000 lives and more than \n10,000 casualties in Anhui. The severity of accidents is high as shown by the average of \n1.6 fatalities and injuries in each accident. Road safety risks on low-grade roads remain high \nbecause most were built at a time when little attention was given to safe design. Safety is of \ngreat concern to local communities. Comments received during field surveys centered on the \nneed to apply \"traffic calming\" measures such as \u201cgo slow\u201d signs and rumble devices for local \nroads  traversing  communities.  Other  concerns  include  poor  road  conditions,  poor  junction \ndesign and signage provisions, and poor pedestrian provisions. \n \n13.  Despite  good  progress  in  providing  village  bus  services  connecting  townships  with \ncounties, some 3,800 administrative villages still have no formal bus service in Anhui. This is \ndue in part to the licensing and regulatory system, which restricts the provision of service unless \na number of specific conditions are met. Transport demand in these circumstances is usually \nmet by various unlicensed transport services, often using vehicles unsuitable for the purpose, \nwhich  are  not  properly  maintained  and  are  not  always  driven  safely.  The  ADB  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services5 outlined  how  the  PRC  could \nregularize the informal (unlicensed) bus operators to foster better rural bus services by setting \nup more flexible regulatory frameworks and reforming rural public transportation. The transport \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.

The problem and constraints analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n2  Government and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n \n14.  The Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) focuses on balanced, equitable, \nand sustainable development.6 The Government pledges to increase farmers\u2019 incomes, improve \ninfrastructure, and enhance public services in the countryside. Transport development is a high \npriority as it is considered essential for promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. The \ncentral region grew at a slower pace than the rest of the PRC in the 1990s. In 2004, the State \nCouncil declared the development of the central region a priority task and formulated the \nCentral Region Development Strategy. To achieve this strategy, the Government has stepped \nup  construction  of  transportation  infrastructure,  particularly  in  Anhui.  Pursuant  to  this,  the \nstrategy of APG is to boost eastward development and rapidly integrate the economy with \nneighboring provinces, especially the wealthier provinces to the east. The Project will play \nimportant roles in fulfilling the Government strategy. \n \n15.  The theme of ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy for 2008\u20132010 is mainstreaming \ninclusive growth and environmentally sustainable development.7 The Project is consistent with \nthe  strategy,  in  particular  its  main  strategic  pillars  of  (i)  inclusive  growth  and  balanced \ndevelopment, (ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability, and (iii) support for the \nenvironment for private sector participation. The strategy also seeks to mainstream knowledge \nand innovation in projects by optimizing the use of TA.  \n \n3  Development Coordination \n \n16.  The road subsector in the PRC has received considerable external assistance. Since \n1991, ADB has extended 38 loans totaling $7.7 billion to finance 5,270 km of expressways and \n11,194 km of associated local road networks. Project completion reports prepared for 22 road \nprojects  conclude  that  21  were  \u201chighly  successful\u201d or  \u201cgenerally  successful,\u201d and  1  \u201cpartly \nsuccessful.\u201d8 ADB advisory TA projects have addressed policy and institutional issues, including \nhighway planning, road safety, socioeconomic assessment, transport pricing, and mobilization \nof nongovernment financial resources. The World Bank has provided about $9.4 billion, the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency about \u00a5195 billion, and the European Investment Bank \nand Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement provided cofinancing of Euro 85 million to finance \nroad investments. ADB coordinates with these organizations to discuss progress and issues in \nthe sector, and meets regularly with the World Bank for coordination and information sharing. A \nsummary of development coordination to the road sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n4.  Lessons \n \n17.  Although this is the first ADB road project in Anhui, ADB has several projects focusing \non railways, and the social and energy sectors. These projects have developed the capacity of \nAPG  and  local  governments  in  project  implementation.  The  project  design  benefited  from \nlessons from ADB's 2008 sector assistance program evaluation of ADB assistance for roads \n                                                 \n6  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2006.

Manila. \n8  The \u201cpartly successful\u201d rating was due to inadequate safety facilities and enforcement. Remedial actions were \ntaken to rectify the issues. The Project was subsequently rated \u201csuccessful\u201d in the project performance audit report. \n ", "5 \nand railways in the PRC,9 as well as from the lessons of three World Bank-financed road \nprojects in Anhui.10 The following lessons guided the design of the Project. \n \n18.  Strategic  Integration  of  Local  Roads  in  Project  Scope.  International  financial \ninstitutions coupled expressway projects in the PRC with local road improvements on the basis \nthat including local roads would increase the poverty reduction impacts. However, local roads \nwould often have been constructed anyway, and those components complicated the institutional \nand financial arrangements without adding value. The project design addresses these issues. \nBy financing a significant portion of APG's local road program in areas selected for support \nunder the Project, the Project will enable implementation of local roads in particularly poor areas \nto be completed much earlier than without an ADB project. The use of existing implementation \nmechanisms will eliminate burdensome institutional or financial arrangements. The project\u2019s \nlocal road program provides an opportunity for extended dialogue with APG on improving \napproaches to planning, designing, and financing local roads and providing bus services on \nlocal roads. It also provides a demonstration effect of improved practices in the area of planning, \nresource optimization, and safety enhancements. \n \n19.  Selectivity  in  Policy  Dialogue  Issues  to  Add  Value. The institutional capacity of \nprovincial  communications  departments  increased  substantially  in  1997\u20132008.  Many  of  the \npolicy and institutional investments supported by ADB have been adopted and institutionalized. \nADB should adopt more focused and in-depth engagement on features that can still add value. \nTo gain better ownership, institutional strengthening activities and policy reforms should be \nlinked with investment components. The project value addition components received the full \nsupport of the Anhui Provincial Department of Transport (APDOT) during project formulation.  \n \n20.  Links between Advisory Work and Projects. The recommendations of several ADB \nTA  projects  were  integrated  in  the  project  design,  in  particular:  (i)  the  Sustainable  Rural \nTransport Services TA provided the model for the village bus transport service reform and pilot \nprojects  (footnote  5);  (ii)  the  resource  optimization  TA11 was  disseminated  to  APDOT  (the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  Project)  for  road  capacity  optimization  and  natural  resource \npreservation; (iii) the Resource Manual for Health and Safety in Infrastructure developed under \nan ADB TA12 was distributed to APDOT and will be piloted under the Project; (iv) the report of \nthe corporatization, leasing, and securitization TA13 was distributed to APDOT and will serve as \na basis for exploring private participation options in the sector during the Project; and (v) in \naddition  to  conducting  project  design,  the  project  preparatory  TA14 supported  some  initial \nimplementation activities of the road safety and village bus services components, which were \nappreciated by APG and local communities. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2007.

Policy  dialogue  during project  preparation  contributed  to  (i)  integrating  a  local  road \nnetwork  program  to  improve  accessibility  to  remote  and  low  income  areas,  (ii) integrating \nresource  optimization  and  environmental  sustainability  elements  in  project  design, \n(iii) incorporating  advisory  work  on  establishing  a  sustainable  financing  framework, \n(iv) addressing  road  traffic  safety  issues,  (v)  initiating  sustainable  rural  village  bus  service \ndevelopment, and (vi) facilitating private sector participation. The policy dialogue matrix is in \nAppendix 4. \n \n22.  Extended  dialogue  with  the  provincial  government  resulted  in  a  well-balanced  road \nconfiguration.  The  Project  will  build  an  expressway  to  help  realize  the  regional  economic \nopportunities available through expansion of interprovincial trade and socioeconomic integration \nwith  eastern  provinces,  and  will  address  local  road  network  deficiencies  by  including  a \nsubstantial local road improvement program. The Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway (XME) is a \nkey element of the central region transport network and is a high-priority project in its 5-year plan. \nAPG considers the accessibility improvements to be a key component of its provincial poverty \nreduction plan and a key initiative to promote integrated rural and urban development. \n \n23.  Careful consideration was given to project scale, route selection, and land acquisition. \nAfter reviewing the traffic forecasts and expected capacity required, the scope of the XME was \nreduced from a dual three-lane carriageway to a dual two-lane carriageway. In addition, the \ndesign of the subgrade width for the two-lane carriageway was reduced from 28 meters to \n27 meters. The total cost was reduced by 30% as a result of this optimization. To achieve an \nenvironmentally acceptable alignment and minimize land acquisition, a section of the XME was \nrealigned to avoid the Tuo Lake Nature Reserve. \n \n24.  During project preparation, the Government introduced the new fuel tax and removed \nvarious existing tolls and fees (para. 10). As part of policy dialogue, ADB shared international \nexperiences regarding mechanisms for establishing a sustainable road financing framework, \nincluding use of road asset management systems and establishing road funds. This led to the \ninclusion in the Project of a study to formulate a sustainable financing framework. \n \n25.  As part of an initial demonstration phase for the rural village bus services component of \nthe Project, APDOT agreed to introduce changes in the organization and regulation of public \ntransport  services  in  the  selected  counties.  The  groundwork  for  the  demonstration  project \ncommenced in two townships (Shipai and Ducun). Formulation of this component was therefore \nable to take into account the reference of an initial phase of implementation, which helped to \nensure that the component is realistic in its aim and adapted to the local setting. The Project will \ndemonstrate how the reform will work, and involves stakeholders in the design of the system \nand in monitoring its performance once it is in operation. \n \n26.  During  project  preparation,  the  Anhui  Communications  Investment  Group  Company \nLimited (ACIG) expressed interest in seeking private sector participation in the XME once it is \nbuilt. The Government agreed to explore options including joint venture, asset securitization,15 \nand bond issue. \n \n                                                 \n15  The sale of highway equity through initial public offerings and private placements, as a substitute for long-term debt \nfinancing.  \n ", "7 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  The impact of the Project will be an integrated road transport system that supports the \nCentral Region Development Strategy. This will be achieved through provision of an efficient, \nsafe,  and  sustainable  road  transport  system  to  promote  inclusive  growth  and  balanced \ndevelopment, and improve resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. \n \nB.  Outputs \n28.  The Project will benefit about 4.0 million people, of whom 90% are rural residents. The \nProject has three distinct locations, including eight municipalities and 14 counties and/or districts \n(see Map). The project description is in Appendix 5. \n \n(i)  Output  1.  Improve  road  infrastructure  in  the  Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang  corridor \n(component A). The Project will expand the road capacity in northeast Anhui by \nconstructing a new 139 km, four-lane, access controlled XME with a design \nspeed of 120 km/hour.16 The component is estimated to cost $995.4 million, of \nwhich ADB will finance $118.5 million. \n \n(ii)  Output 2. Improve local roads and traffic safety practices (component B). A total \nof 452 km of local roads will be upgraded or rehabilitated. Traffic safety design, \noperation,  and  management  practices  on  these  existing  local  roads  will  be \nimproved. The local roads are identified either as key links for interprovincial and \nintercounty roads, or as critical missing links in the road networks in low-income \nareas. The component is estimated to cost $356.1 million, of which ADB will \nfinance $79.8 million. \n \n(iii)  Output 3. Improve rural village bus services (component C). As suggested by \nthe ADB TA on Sustainable Rural Transport Services (footnote 5), APDOT will \nintroduce village bus licensing reform consisting of vehicle license, operator's \nlicense, and route license for all bus services in project townships (Shipai, Ducun, \nand Xiaowei). The component will (a) develop local bus operators based in the \nthree townships, which will have the right to provide a coordinated network of bus \nservices to the surrounding villages; and (b) amend the licensing regulations \napplicable to bus services between townships and villages, and between villages, \nto permit greater flexibility in the use of vehicles, fares charged, and type of \nvehicles used. The Project will also finance the setting up of small-scale bus \nstations, and bus shelters and stops in the three selected project townships. The \ncomponent is estimated to cost $2 million, of which ADB will finance $200,000. \n \n(iv)  Output  4:  Strengthen  institutional  capacity  (component  D):  (a) improve \nmaintenance financing by preparing concept, feasibility analysis, and action plan \nfor the creation of a new financial framework for recommendation by APG; and \n(b)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  by  providing  international  and  on-the-job \ntraining to APDOT, its related agencies, and ACIG staff notably involved in road \nsafety, maintenance, public transport services, private sector participation, and \n                                                 \n16  The start point of the XME is the provincial border with Jiangsu Province in the north, with a 4 km extension to \nconnect Xuzhou via the Xuzhou\u2013Huai'an Expressway, and it ends at an interchange in Mingguang on the Bengbu\u2013\nNanjing Expressway in the south. Based on an agreement reached between the Jiangsu and Anhui governments \non 4 May 2009, Jiangsu will finance and complete the 4 km link by 2013. \n ", "8 \nenvironment management. ADB will finance the estimated component cost of \n$1.5 million. \n \nC.  Special Features \n29.  The Project is designed according to the principles of sustainable transport to provide \naccess  to  people,  places,  goods,  and  services  in  an  environmentally  responsible,  socially \nacceptable, and economically and financially viable manner. Strategic actions and features to \nensure sustainability are addressed as an integral part of the project design. \n \n30.  Reinforce  Regional  Integration.  The  Project  is  designed  to  reduce  inter-  and \nintraprovincial development disparities. It will (i) strategically integrate Anhui Province with more \nprosperous neighboring provinces to the east thereby supporting trade and socioeconomic \nintegration  and  expanding  access  to  economic  opportunities;  (ii)  support  more  balanced \ndevelopment of all classes of road networks to contribute to the improvement of living conditions \nacross  the  province,  particularly  in  poverty  areas;  (iii)  enhance  transport  accessibility  and \nconnectivity by integrating a network of local roads into the trunk highway system and linking to \nmajor centers, counties, and townships; and (iv) incorporate other types of facilities such as \nwalkways and bike paths for pedestrians to benefit local communities. In particular, the Project \nwill contribute to economic and social integration by facilitating the mobility of people, goods, and \nservices; and attracting more investment to the interior. \n \n31.  Formulate a Sustainable Financing Framework. Efficient road asset management is \nessential to ensure sustainability. APDOT is committed to ensuring sufficient funding to maintain \nthe local project roads with good or fair services. To assist APG in developing its approach to \nutilization of fuel tax revenues, the Project will finance a study to develop a new financing \nframework for road maintenance and debt repayment. It will facilitate the development of a \nprovincial road fund. APG is committed to allocating a growing share of its road budgets to road \nmaintenance, rehabilitation, and institutional strengthening. In parallel, APDOT will investigate \noptions  for  developing  private  participation  in  the  road  subsector  through  corporatization, \nleasing, concessions, or securitization of its expressway assets. \n \n32.  Initiate a Comprehensive Safety Enhancement Program. To mitigate accident risks \nassociated with local road improvement, the Project will (i) improve arrangements for traffic flow \nby  segregating  nonmotorized  and  vulnerable  traffic,  separating  opposing  traffic,  controlling \naccess,  and  ensuring  grade  separation;  (ii)  provide  better  junction  design  and  introduce \nchannelization at intersections; (iii) provide innovative road signs and markings; and (iv) provide \n\"traffic calming\" measures to reduce traffic speed in mixed traffic environments. Road safety \naudits  will  be  carried  out  during  design,  implementation,  operation,  and  evaluation.  Such \nproactive approaches will yield significant safety gains at a cost much lower than would be \nincurred if problems were to be added later in \"black spot\" programs of remedial works at \nlocations with high accidents.  \n \n33.  Introduce the Village Bus Licensing System. Based on the reforms suggested by the \nADB TA for Sustainable Rural Transport Services (footnote 5), the Project will (i) introduce a \nvillage bus licensing system comprising vehicle licenses, operator licenses, and route licenses \nfor all bus services in project townships;17 (ii) select a suitable bus operator company for each \nproject township; (iii) provide exclusive authority to the selected bus operator companies on all \nlicensed routes; and (iv) approve the maximum limit of the bus fares suggested by the pricing \nbureaus by taking into account all cost considerations. APG will give discretion to the bus \n                                                 \n17  Implementation has started in Shi Pai township (Huaining county) and Du Cun township (Qingyang county), and \nwill be carried out in Xiao Wei township (Wuhe county) during project implementation.  \n ", "9 \noperator companies to vary the fares below the maximum limit. In addition, traffic police will \nenforce all traffic regulations in the project townships, in particular strict restraint on running \nunlicensed vehicles. \n \n34.  Optimize Resources. Drawing on the findings of the ADB TA for Resource Optimization \nin the Road Sector (footnote 11), project preparation drew upon a sustainable transport analysis \n(Appendix 6) and incorporates a package of measures to better conserve resources including  \n(i) recycle existing pavement and road base material for the local road network improvement \nprogram to reduce resource requirement and costs; (ii) reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and \nother pollutants by reducing fuel consumption as a result of a more optimal transport route and \nmore  efficient  driving  speeds  (Appendix  7);  (iii) reduce  noise  by  incorporating  low-noise \npavement, noise barriers, and noise insulation windows in the detailed design of the XME;  \n(iv) require measures for topsoil preservation in the construction area and soil extraction areas \nto conserve soil materials required for agricultural activities; (v) include development of a waste \nmanagement  plan  to  identify  and  reduce  total  waste  generated  during  construction  in  the \nenvironmental management plan; (vi) implement measures to reduce water consumption and \navoid water wastage during construction; and (vii) appoint an independent environment, health, \nand safety supervisory team to audit and provide certified reports to APDOT and ADB on \nenvironment, health, and safety aspects of the project works. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n35.  The project investment cost is estimated at $1,355 million, including financing charges \nduring construction and taxes and duties (Table 1).

The Government has requested a loan of $200,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \n ", "10 \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. The Government will finance contingencies and financing charges during \nimplementation. \n \n37.  The ADB loan will finance 14.8% of the project cost. The remaining cost will be financed \nby the Ministry of Transport, APG, ACIG, and cofinancing through loans from the Industrial and \nCommercial Bank of China and Bank of China, which have appraised the Project and provided \ncommitment  letters  to  APDOT.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  APG  have  made  budgetary \nprovisions for the counterpart funds. The PRC will be the Borrower. The ADB loan proceeds will \nbe made available to APG on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The Government \nwill ensure that (i) APG onlends the ADB loan proceeds to APDOT; (ii) APG causes APDOT to \napply a portion of the loan proceeds in an amount of $81.5 million for components B, C, and D; \nand  (iii)  APG  causes  APDOT  to  onlend  a  portion  of  loan  proceeds  in  an  amount  of \n$118.5 million  to  ACIG  for  component  A.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  onlending \nagreements will be executed upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. APG and ACIG will \nbear the exchange rate and interest rate variation risks on the ADB loan. All onlending under the \nProject will be on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The \nfinancing plan is in Table 2.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n38.  APDOT will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall implementation of the \nProject. The existing Foreign Fund Project Management Office (PMO) within APDOT will be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  Within  APDOT,  the  project  activities  will  be \ncoordinated  by  three  implementing  agencies\u2014ACIG  (component A),  Anhui  Highway \nAdministration Bureau (AHAB) (component B), and Anhui Transportation Administration Bureau \n(ATAB) (component C), under the overall direction of the PMO. APDOT, through the PMO, will \nbe  responsible  for  direct  implementation  of  component D.  The  PMO  will  oversee  project \nimplementation; submit progress, audit, and other reports to ADB; and manage day-to-day \nactivities  in  connection  with  the  Project.  APDOT  and  ACIG  have  experience,  and  shown \nsatisfactory performance in implementing internationally financed projects. \n \n39.  ACIG  will  establish  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  company,  Xuming  Expressway \nManagement Company Limited, to implement component A. By 28 February 2010, the company \nis to be duly incorporated under the Company Law of the PRC as ACIG's wholly owned \nsubsidiary. ACIG will send the certificate of incorporation and shareholders directory to ADB \nupon its incorporation. ACIG will be in charge of the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the \nXME with possible outsourcing of related activities. AHAB will manage the O&M for local project \n ", "11 \nroads.  The  PMO  will  manage  procurement  activities  on  behalf  of  the  three  implementing \nagencies. The organization chart is in Appendix 9. \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n40.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  5 years  from  mid-2010  to  mid-2015 \n(Appendix 10). Construction of the XME is expected to take 3 years. The individual local road \nand safety enhancement subprojects will each be implemented over 2 years, with the overall \nprogram  of  such  improvements  spread  over  5  years;  implementation  of  the  rural  bus \ndemonstration project and capacity development components will take about 4 years. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n41.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) will be included in all bidding documents for the Project. Contracts for works \nestimated to cost $10.0 million or more will be procured using international competitive bidding \nprocedures. Contracts for works estimated to cost less than the international competitive bidding \nthreshold but more than $200,000 will be procured on the basis of national competitive bidding \nprocedures in accordance with the PRC tendering and bidding laws, subject to modifications \nagreed with ADB. Contracts for works estimated to cost $200,000 or less will be procured using \nshopping  procedures.  Prior  review  will  be  applied  for  all  international  competitive  bidding \ncontracts, the first national competitive bidding contract for works and goods, and post review \nfor other national competitive bidding and shopping contracts. Small bus stations, stops, and \nshelters financed by ADB will be procured through shopping procedures. Various thresholds for \ncontract packages are set out in Appendix 11. A full procurement plan is in Supplementary \nAppendix  C.  During  project  preparation,  ADB  assessed  the  PMO\u2019s  capacity  to  handle \nprocurement and found it to be acceptable. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n42.  The Project will finance 20 person-months of international consulting services, including \n5 person-months each for the following specialists: (i) road safety, (ii) rural village bus services, \n(iii) road asset management, and (iv) environmental management. Considering the need to \ncontinue previous work carried out and application of background studies and analysis, the \ninternational consultants engaged for preparing this Project under the project preparatory TA will \nbe recruited using individual consultant selection to provide support for the road safety and rural \nvillage bus services components. \n \n43.  The Project will also provide $300,000 ($100,000 for each of three activities) to finance \nnational consulting services for (i) supervision of the rural village bus services demonstration \nproject, (ii) supervision of the local road traffic safety program, and (iii) the road sector financing \nstudy.  Given  the  very  small  contract  values  and  intensive  relevant  experience  of  the  two \nnational firms18 proposed by APDOT for the project consulting services, the two national firms \nwill be selected using single-source selection. For the roads financing study, a consulting firm \nwill be engaged based on a simplified technical proposal using the consultant's qualifications \nselection method. In addition, APDOT will engage and entirely finance 6,000 person-months of \n                                                 \n18  Anhui Communications Vocational and Technical College undertook the preparation of the rural village bus \nservices component under the project preparatory TA, and the terms of reference for the TA identified the related \nwork during implementation as a continuation. The Anhui Tongtai Traffic Engineering Design and Research \nInstitute, which started the groundwork of local road safety tasks under the TA, was identified to continue the \nrelated work during implementation.  \n ", "12 \nnational  consultants  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  All \nconsultants financed from ADB loan resources will be recruited in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007 as amended from time to time). Outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n  5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n44.  Given the high priority accorded to the Project, on 21 July 2009 ADB approved advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  for  civil  works  and \nconsulting services not exceeding $40 million incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier \nthan a maximum of 12 months before signing of the loan agreement. Advance contracting \ncovers the prequalification of contractors, bidding, bid evaluation, and contract award. Advance \ncontracting  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The \nGovernment was advised that approval of the advance contracting does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. \n \n  6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n45.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be \nmade for large contracts, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw \nthe  loan  funds.  If  the  Government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB's \nreimbursement procedure will be used. To expedite funds flow and simplify the documentation \nprocess, Anhui Provincial Finance Department may establish and manage a separate imprest \naccount as required by APDOT after loan effectiveness. Anhui Provincial Finance Department \nhas  adequate  capacity  to  manage  the  funds  based  on  financial  management  assessment \nrecommendations. Disbursement from the imprest account will be supported by an appropriate \nwithdrawal application and related documentation. The ceiling of the imprest account will be set \nas either the estimated expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the next \n6 months, or 10% of the loan account, whichever is lower.19 The statement of expenditures \nprocedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances \nprovided into the imprest account for individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of \n$200,000 in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon by the Government and ADB. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n46.  APDOT will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project and related financial \nstatements. The project accounts and financial statements will be maintained in accordance \nwith sound accounting principles and practices as prescribed by the Accounting Law of the \nPRC. APDOT will have such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by \nindependent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable \nto ADB, and in accordance with auditing standards that are acceptable to ADB. The audit of \nsuch financial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and \ninternal control systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, \nand (ii) an assessment of compliance with loan covenants that may be agreed under the Project \nand ADB's requirements on project management. Within 6 months of the end of each related \nfiscal year, APDOT will submit to ADB the project\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements, \naudited project accounts, audit reports, and management letters in both English and Chinese. A \n                                                 \n19  The bank charges incurred in the imprest account will be financed from the loan amount, in line with the ADB \nOperations Manual section on cost sharing and eligibility of expenditures for ADB financing. ADB. 2008. Cost \nSharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for ADB Financing. Operations Manual. OM Section H3/BP. Manila. \n ", "13 \nseparate audit opinion on the use of the statement of expenditures and the imprest account, if \nany, will be included as part of the auditor's report.' \n \n47.  To  ensure  that  internal  controls  and  checks  on  the  project  construction  costs  and \noperations  are  effective,  APDOT  and  ACIG  will  use  its  internal  audit  unit  to  carry  out \nindependent checks during project implementation. The internal audit units will independently \ntest financial transactions of the PMO and ACIG to ensure the safe custody of the project-\nfinanced assets. APDOT will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of \nproject implementation to ADB by submitting quarterly progress reports to ADB as well as a \ncompletion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n8.  Project Performance Management System \n \n48.  The project performance monitoring system indicators, their relevance, and monitoring \npracticalities  were  confirmed  and  agreed  with  APDOT  during  project  preparation.  The  key \nindicators and assumptions outlined in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and \nmonitoring of socioeconomic and poverty impacts are attached as Supplementary Appendix E, \nwhich will form the core data required for the project performance monitoring system. APDOT \nwill measure the indicators and report the key findings to ADB on project inception, during the \nmidterm review, at completion, and for 3 years thereafter. \n \n9.  Anticorruption Policy \n49.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the local and central governments. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan  and  project  agreements  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency; ACIG; \nAHAB; ATAB; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the Project. \n \n50.  APDOT and ACIG will ensure, during project implementation, that (i) officials from the \nDiscipline and Inspection Bureau monitor bidding process, construction, and operations of the \nProject; (ii) the internal audit unit is strengthened in ACIG with additional staff and resources; \n(iii) a two-contract system is adopted where the winner of a civil works contract will also sign an \nanticorruption contract with the employer; (iv) periodic inspection of contractors is undertaken to \nensure that fund withdrawal and settlement procedures are followed; and (v) the status of \nprocurement and award of contracts are published on APDOT\u2019s website. APDOT and ACIG will \ninitiate liaison meetings with the Prosecutor's Office, as needed, to discuss any warnings about, \nor information on, any corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n51.  In addition to regular annual reviews by ADB staff, a detailed midterm review of the \nProject is scheduled for 2 years after the start of implementation. The review will cover all \ninstitutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, financial, \nand other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the project\u2019s performance and its \ncontinuing viability. It will identify any problems or weakness in implementation arrangements, \nand agree on any changes needed to achieve the project objectives. \n ", "14 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Policy and Institutional Improvements \n52.  The policy and institutional improvement activities will help APDOT  (i) prepare and \nsubmit the road maintenance financing framework recommendations to APG for consideration, \n(ii) incorporate road safety audit recommendations in project road design to mitigate safety risks \nand reduce road accident rates, and (iii) implement rural village bus services licensing and \noperation reforms in three pilot townships and surrounding villages. The component will also \nhelp ACIG establish an independent environment, health, and safety team to provide training \nand  information  to  the  construction  workforce,  and  to  impartially  review  and  audit  various \ncontractors  on  their  environmental,  health,  and  safety  practices.  These  activities  will  help \nsupport the sustainability of the Project. \n \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n53.  The XME will introduce a shorter route between Xuzhou and Nanjing\u2014two important \ntransport hubs in the PRC. The XME will increase capacity to meet transport demand on the \nroute, release traffic congestion, and significantly reduce transport costs and travel times. The \ntraffic  projection  was  prepared  using  a  conventional  four-step  traffic  forecast  model.  An \nindependent validation of the assumption was used in the traffic modeling for the feasibility \nstudy. A \"ramp-up\" factor was built in to take into account experience in previous projects that \ntraffic gradually builds up and the full potential traffic is not realized for a few years.20 Traffic on \nthe XME is forecast to grow from an average about 12,000 passenger car units per day in 2014 \nto an average of about 48,000 in 2033. The traffic forecast is in Appendix 12. \n \nC.  Economic Analysis \n54.  The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return was estimated by comparing scenarios \nwith  and  without  the  Project.  The  project\u2019s  economic  costs  reflect  (i)  the  capital  cost  for \nconstruction including physical contingencies, land acquisition, and resettlement; (ii) O&M costs, \nincluding replacing depreciated equipment and periodic maintenance; and (iii) environmental \nmanagement and monitoring costs. The economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating \ncosts as a result of reduced road length, and improved traffic and road conditions; (ii) time \nsavings for road users; (iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents; and \n(iv) savings in carbon dioxide emissions. The Project is economically viable. The economic \ninternal rate of return is 15.8% for the whole Project, 15.5% for the XME, and 16.9% for the local \nroad component. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability. \nThe economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nD.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n55.  The project's financial analysis was prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines for the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.21 For  the  XME,  the  projected  financial \nstatements  indicate  that  financial  revenue  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  O&M  costs  and  debt \nservicing in all operating years and provide a reasonable rate of return. The financial internal \nrate of return for the XME, computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.6% without increasing the \nexisting  toll  fee.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, of 3.7%. The XME is considered both financially viable and \nsustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the Project is viable even in adverse conditions. \n                                                 \n20 The feasibility study conducted by APDOT assumed about 15,000 passenger car units in 2014.  \n21  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "15 \nACIG is aware that the amount of expressway tolls and their regular review are important for the \nfinancial viability of the XME. Six months prior to opening the XME, ACIG will analyze the \nfeasibility of accessing financial markets for future road sector investments, and possible private \nsector  participation  in  O&M  of  the  XME.  The  financial  analysis  and  projections  are  in \nAppendix 13. The financial management assessment of APDOT and the implementing agencies \nfound that they meet financial management requirements, and can provide accurate and timely \ninformation in the reports required by ADB (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \nE.  Social Impact \n1.  Poverty and Socioeconomic Impacts \n \n56.  Poverty incidence in the project area is 10.5% on average, using a $1.25 a day poverty \nline at 2005 purchasing power parity.22 Poverty incidence in Yuexi, which will benefit directly \nfrom the rehabilitation of a local project road (S209), is 29.5%. The XME23 and upgrading of \nlocal road X056 will directly benefit Lingbi and Sixian counties, which have poverty incidence of \n19.6% and 18.0%, respectively. Six national or provincial poverty counties will directly benefit \nfrom the Project, accounting for 43% of the total project beneficiary counties. Consequently, the \nProject will facilitate poverty reduction. The Project will also help the rural poor to seek more \nnonfarm employment opportunities. Improved access to eastern provinces will attract more \nlabor intensive industries to transfer to Anhui, which will provide additional opportunities for \nemployment for the surplus rural labor force. \n \n57.  The Project will have a range of social and economic benefits for local people and \ngovernments including (i) transport cost and time savings; (ii) traffic accident cost savings; \n(iii) improved access to health care and social services; (iv) direct job opportunities during \nconstruction  and  operation;  (v)  promotion  of  integrated  rural\u2013urban  development  through \nprovision of bypasses and road safety facilities in small towns; (vi) new countryside construction \nthrough integrating local government initiatives with the project\u2019s resettlement work; (vii) value \naddition  to  agricultural  production  through  better  access  to  regional  markets;  (viii) tourism \ndevelopment; and (ix) creation of an enabling environment for private sector development, \nwhich is the core of local governments\u2019 master plans. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy are in Appendix 14. \n \n58.  Anhui has a large surplus rural labor force, which is a main cause of low rural income. \nThe Project will encourage the use of local labor and material supply during road construction, \nemploying about 440,000 person-months of local unskilled labor. About 20% of this employment \nfor unskilled labor is expected to go to the poor. This could then benefit an equivalent of some \n7,350 poor laborers or households with some 31,000 people over 4 years (assuming one \nunskilled laborer works 3 months a year). Consequently, this would bring additional income of \nabout CNY3,000 for a family or CNY700 for each person every year. This additional income \nwould help a poor household gradually move out of poverty. \n \n59.  The gender assessment conducted as part of the social and poverty analysis found that \nthe Project can contribute to increasing the social, educational, and health status of women. The \nProject is not expected to have any adverse effects on women. Given the history of such \nprojects  in  the  PRC,  women  have  always  been  an  integral  part  of  project  planning, \n                                                 \n22  Using a $2 a day poverty line (at 2005 purchasing power parity), the rural poverty incidence rate was 25.2% in \n2007 for the 14 project beneficiary counties, with a poverty incidence of 59.8% for Yuexi, 56.8% for Qianshan, \n34.7% for Lingbi, and 34.0% for Sixian. \n23 It will benefit 2.8 million people in three counties (Linbi, Sixian, and Wuhe), two of which (Linbi and Sixian) are \nofficially designated poverty counties, and one city (Mingguang). \n ", "16 \nimplementation, and postconstruction activities. The road safety component of the Project will \nlargely benefit women because women, children, and the elderly are the main pedestrians. \nMoreover, the village bus services component will allow easy access to township centers, which \nenable women to access townships in less time, more cost effectively, and with greater safety. \nThe  Project  will  provide  necessary  provisions  for  empowering  women  during  project \nimplementation,  and  anticipates  continued  participation  of  women  during  planning, \nimplementation, and postconstruction activities with assistance from the All-China Women's \nFederation. ADB's Policy on Gender Development (1998) will be followed. \n \n60.  The social development action plan (SDAP) was formulated based on discussions with \nAPDOT and other relevant agencies (Supplementary Appendix G). The SDAP is designed to \nensure the mitigation of potential social risks and enhancement of social benefits in an inclusive \nmanner, especially for the poor, women, and other vulnerable groups. The SDAP specifies key \nactions, target groups, implementing agencies, funding source, and monitoring indicators. Key \nfeatures of the SDAP include (i) road safety, including community involvement; (ii) income and \nlivelihood recovery for resettlement of affected people; (iii) transmissible disease prevention; \n(iv) avoidance of community disturbance during project construction; (v) enhancement of local \neconomic benefits from project construction; (vi) complementary poverty reduction programs; \n(vii) gender and development measures for women; and (viii) transport service improvements. \nThe SDAP will be reviewed again during the loan inception mission, and some modifications \ncould be made if necessary. ACIG, AHAB, and ATAB will be responsible for coordinating \nactions with other relevant agencies, as specified, and will collect monitoring data, including \ngender-disaggregated data, as specified in the SDAP. \n \n61.  The Project will pilot test the Resource Manual for Health and Safety in Infrastructure \ndeveloped under the ADB TA for Preventing HIV/AIDS on Road Projects in Yunnan Province \n(footnote 12). Separate measures to prevent HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases are \nincluded in the project design. Health, awareness, screening, and treatment requirements are \nstipulated in the ADB standard contract bidding document and compliance will be monitored \nregularly. \n \n62.  Public consultation for the Project was undertaken in three phases: initial consultations \nat  project  initiation,  a  first  formal  round  of  public  consultation  of  environmental  impact \nassessments (EIAs) and resettlement plans, and a second round of public consultation to gather \nopinions on environment and resettlement measures. More than 12,000 people participated in \nthe consultation activities. The stakeholders' consultation and participation are documented in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n \n  3.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n63.  This is an involuntary resettlement category A project. APCD prepared resettlement \nplans  for  the  XME  and  for  three  of  the  nine  local  roads  that  have  resettlement  impacts. \nResettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected  villages  in  June  2009.  This \nProject requires acquisition of 952 hectares of land. The Project will cause some land loss in \n129  villages,  which  partially  affects  an  estimated  17,000  households.  Also,  about \n1,170 households will need to be relocated; the number was reduced by optimizing the XME \nalignment and constructing bypasses around towns for the upgraded local roads. For land \ncompensation, the same standards have been adopted for the XME and the local roads. The \nfour resettlement plans will be updated based on detailed design and detailed measurement \nsurveys, and then submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to commencement of civil works. No \nethnic minorities in the project area are affected. The summary resettlement plan is included in \nAppendix 15. \n ", "17 \nF.  Environmental Impact \n64.  This is an environmental category A project. APDOT prepared an EIA report for the \nproject expressway; Anhui Environmental Protection Department approved the report on 28 July \n2009. APDOT also prepared four EIA reports for nine local project roads; Anhui Environmental \nProtection Department approved these on 22 June 2009. An initial environmental examination \nwas  prepared  for  the  three  bus  stations.  A  summary  EIA,  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) for the Project, was discussed and endorsed by APDOT, circulated to \nthe ADB Board of Directors, and made public through the ADB website on 4 July 2009. The \nEIAs, the initial environmental examination, and the summary EIA assess the environmental \nimpact  of  the  selected  alignments  of  the  expressway,  local  roads,  and  bus  stations;  and \nprescribe environmental protection and mitigation measures costing CNY109 million. To ensure \nthat all the potential adverse environmental impacts of the Project are mitigated, APDOT will \nimplement  the  EMPs  as  specified  in  the  EIAs  and  the  summary  EIA.  The  EMPs  will  be \nincorporated in the bidding documents and contracts for civil works; they will be monitored and \nsemiannual reports submitted to ADB. \n \nG.  Risks \n65.  Overall, the project risk is rated low. The Project does not have any unusual technical \nrisks. The project design considered potential financial and social risks. All local roads under the \nProject will be toll free. A financial analysis was conducted of provincial revenue, including the \navailability of sufficient counterpart funds, future maintenance and operating expenses, as well \nas loan repayments. This revealed that the fiscal impact and financial risks of the Project are \nlow. Social issues include land acquisition and resettlement, road safety, and prevention of \ntransmissible diseases. Appropriate mitigation measures are in place in the resettlement plans, \nroad and traffic management designs, and disease prevention awareness program. \n \n66.  The risk of implementation delays in timely approvals of the recommended regulatory \nchanges  of  the  village  bus  licensing  system  are  addressed  by  establishing  a  project \ndevelopment group in each county to act as an implementing unit. The project development \ngroup  will  have  authority  to  recommend  implementation  of  regulatory  changes.  Consulting \nservices will be provided during implementation to develop and agree on necessary procedures \nand documentation. Training programs will be designed for bus operators and regulators to train \nthem in the new procedures. ADB will continue dialogue with APG and the Ministry of Transport. \nAny problems will be identified, and adjustments made where necessary to ensure that the new \nsystem works effectively. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n67.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  APG  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n68.  Asset Management. APG will provide adequate resources to ensure the project roads \nare maintained and operated in good condition, and that the benefits of the roads will be \nrealized over their expected lifetimes.  \n \n69.  Coordination Arrangement. The Government will ensure that (i) prior to the opening of \nthe project expressway, the Jiangsu government will construct the section of the expressway in \nJiangsu  province  (about  4  km)  linking  the  project  expressway  to  the  Xuzhou\u2013Huai'an \n ", "18 \nexpressway in Jiangsu, to maximize the benefits of the project expressway; and (ii) such section \nis constructed to at least the same technical standards as those of the project expressway. \n \n70.  Sustainability  and  Resource  Efficiency.  APG  will  ensure  that  resource  efficiency \nprocedures are used in project design and construction including (i) local procurement and \nmanufacturing of materials, (ii) use of existing materials including existing paving and road base \nmaterials, and (iii) development of a waste management plan to be included in the EMP. APG \nwill appoint an independent environment, health, and safety supervisory team within 3 months \nfrom  loan  effectiveness  consisting  of  consultants  having  qualifications  and  experience  in \nengineering, environment, health, and safety. \n \n71.  Road Safety.

Transportation System in Anhui Province \n \n1.  Anhui  Province  has  a  comprehensive  transport  system  framed  by  trunk  railways, \nexpressways, and major navigation waterways. In 2007, the province had 5,600 kilometers (km) \nof navigable waterways, 2,400 km of railways, and 148,000 km of highways. Transport flows in \nAnhui  have  grown  at  about  8.5%  per  annum  since  2003  (8.4%  for  freight  and  8.8%  for \npassengers),  a  lower  rate  than  the  national  average  (13.5%  for  freight  and  9.4%  for \npassengers). At national level, road and inland waterway modes have been dynamic, with rates \nof growth at or above 10%, while railways lagged, on average below 5% per annum. Overall, \nthe transport matrix in Anhui remains healthily balanced, with a relatively more important role of \nthe road network than nationally. Roads carry 64% of passengers, while railways and inland \nwaterways  are  the  preferred  modes  for  freight  transport,  especially  for  bulk  goods.  Road \ntransport plays an essential role in the collection and distribution system, which carried 75% of \ntons in 2007. Figure A2 presents the trends in the production of transport modes in the province. \n \nFigure A2: Transport Demand Trends in Anhui \nFreight Transport in Anhui (t.km) Passenger Transport in Anhui (p.km)\n70% 2,500 70% 1,000\n900\n60% 60%\n2,000 800\n50% m 50% 700 m\nMarket share 234000%%% 11,,050000 100 million t.k Market share 234000%%% 345600000000 100 million p.k\n500 200\n10% 10%\n100\n0% 0 0% 0\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nRailways Waterways Highways Railways Highways\nRailways share Waterways share Highways share Railways share Highways share\nSource: Anhui statistical yearbooks, 2003\u20132007.\n \n \n2.  Anhui's road network is relatively dense but provides poor service to the population. The \ntotal length of highways per habitant brings the province in line with the national average and \nabove its western neighbors. However, road quality in Anhui is relatively limited: (i)12,500 km of \nmain highways (class II or above), placing it in the bottom third of the distribution of provinces; \n(ii) 362 km of arterial class I roads; and (iii) 22% of the network with dual-lane asphalt or cement \nconcrete  surfacing.  The  network  also  presents  an  unbalanced  geographic  distribution \n(Table A2.1). For Anhui to meet its connectivity and capacity needs in the medium term, the \nGovernment estimates that the province will need to double the length of its trunk network \n(5,200 km of class I highways or expressways from 2,500 km in 2007). \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.1: Composition of Anhui Road Network, 2007  \n(km) \nItem  National  Provincial County Township Special Village  Total\nExpressway  811  1,395 0 0 0 0  2,206\nClass I  199  148  15  0  0  0  362 \nClass II  1,951  5929 1,875 49 13 7  9,824\nClass III  143  696  12,249  414  85  261  13,848 \nClass IV  137  298 9,630 31,586 716 59,634  102,001\nTotal  3,241  8,473 23,876 36,224 1004 75,554  148,372\nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Anhui Provincial Department of Transport Yearbook (2007). \n \nB.  Management and Financing of Roads \n \n3.  Anhui Provincial Department of Transport (APDOT) oversees the road subsector; it has \ndirect authority over two agencies: Anhui Highway Administration Bureau (AHAB) and Anhui \nTransport Administration Bureau; it also supervises two public expressway companies, Anhui \nCommunications Investment Group Company Limited and Anhui Expressway Company Limited. \nAs in other provinces in the PRC, APDOT has been mostly relying until 2008 on self-financing \n(user  fees and  tolls), bank  and international  financial  institution  loan  financing,  as  well  as \nMinistry of Transport (MOT) grants and subgovernment contributions rather than on provincial \nbudgets. APDOT's revenues and expenditures grew at 12% per year from 2003 to 2008, but \nincurred a 25% drop in 2008, as impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis initially constrained \nMOT and provincial government expenditures (Table A2.2). \n \nTable A2.2: APDOT Highway Revenue and Expenditure  \n(CNY million) \nItem  2003 2004 2005 2006  2007  2008\nA.

Development Plan for Roads \n \n4.  The Anhui Provincial People\u2019s Government\u2019s (APG) vision is to support sustained growth \nand poverty reduction in Anhui through the development of an integrated high-quality transport \n ", "    Appendix 2  25 \nnetwork. According to its 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010),1 the province will develop integrated \ntransport hubs in six major cities; link all provincial cities by railway, and county towns by \nexpressways; and provide paved access to all villages. Over those 5 years, total investment in \ntransport infrastructure is expected to reach CNY213.5 billion: CNY70.0 billion for railways, \nCNY125.0 billion for highways, CNY8.5 billion for inland waterways, CNY5.0 billion for airports \nand CNY5.0 billion for pipelines. Expressway network length would reach 3,500 km, while \nclass I and II highways would reach 12,500 km. The Government accelerated its infrastructure \ninvestment pace in 2008. During the second half year of 2008, as part of the PRC growth \nstimulus program, APDOT anticipated the construction of six expressways and one bridge that \nwere shovel-ready. The Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway (which the Project would finance) is a \nkey component of the program for 2009 and 2010.  \n \n5.  In parallel to expressway development, APDOT formulated a 3-year \u201c515\u201d program for \nnational and provincial trunk highways. Under this plan, AHAB would invest CNY10 billion to \ndevelop 500 km of class I highways, 10,000 km of class II highways, and undertake 5,000 km of \nrehabilitation works. The identification and prioritization of the investments was undertaken by \nthe APG on the basis of the prioritized criteria described in Box A2. The Project would finance \nnine investments (Appendix 5) considered as priority for 2010, and for which the Government \nidentified a financing gap. The APG and ADB selected the investments with the objectives to \n(i) obtain a demonstration effect of improved practices in the areas of construction techniques \nand safety enhancement, for different classes of roads and civil works; and (ii) increase the \nimpact  of  other  components  of  the  Project  (e.g.,  feeder  roads  for  the  Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang \nExpressway and rural roads in the area of impact of the village bus demonstration project). \n \n \nBox A2: Selection Criteria for the 5-Year Local Roads Investment Program \n \n \n  1.

Fuel Tax Reform. The PRC Government initiated the fuel tax reform on 1 January 2009. \nSix transport user charges collected by provincial and local administrations were abolished. The \ntolls on class II roads were removed in 12 pilot provinces by May 2009, including Anhui. To \ncompensate, the Government introduced a new fuel tax of CNY0.8\u2013CNY1.0 per liter, collected \nby the central administration. The fuel tax reform has several aims: (i) improve the economic \nefficiency of the fee structure, now closer to a pay-as-you-go mechanism, (ii) remove inefficient \ntolling practices, as tolls on class II roads often barely covered operation and maintenance \ncosts, and (iii) improve financial accountability of the sector. In 2009, AHAB expects to receive \nCNY2.4 billion from the central Government,  through the province's finance bureau. AHAB \nplans to prioritize staff and maintenance expenses, while dedicating about CNY400 million to \nupgrading roads. AHAB will soon face important issues regarding the financing of its class I \nroad development program and repayment of debts accumulated for the construction of class II \nroads.3 The reduction of maintenance and investment budgets appears to be a key medium-\nterm risk. \n \n8.  Management of Maintenance of Local Roads. Routine and periodic maintenance has \nhistorically been undertaken by AHAB's local in-house units. With 11,300 staff and a share of \nnonmanagerial  staff  double  that  in  other  provinces  in  the  PRC,  AHAB  appears  currently \noverstaffed, a factor that limits budgets available for maintenance works. With World Bank \nsupport,4  AHAB  has  been  strengthening  its  maintenance  management.  AHAB  is  currently \ndeploying a road asset management system. It pilots the contracting out of periodic and routine \nmaintenance through a combined 2-year contract covering a total of 120 km. Adjusting to this \nnew  framework  would  require  institutional  changes,  such  as  creating  a  performance \nmanagement  regime,  clarifying  the  division\u2019s  responsibilities  for  maintenance,  emergency \nworks, and winter operation of the road; as well as fostering the emergence of multipurpose \nprivate contractors. AHAB has limited capacity to reduce its staff and will thus face difficulties \nscaling-up the pilot on its network. \n \n9.  Road Safety. Road safety continues to be a major issue in the PRC. The road accident-\nrelated  fatalities  exceeded  100,000  annually  in  the  early  2000s.  In  2004,  the  Ministry  of \nTransport launched a highway safety enhancement program to address this situation, involving \nimproved road design, safety audits, removal of black spots, improved road signage, and speed \ncontrol. By 2008, the total number of fatalities was reduced to 73,500. However, with the rapid \nincrease in the number of vehicles and improvements in the quality of roads, road safety \nremains a serious problem. Table A2.3 summarizes the accident situation in Anhui. In 2008, \n8,413 accidents were reported, resulting in 3,000 fatalities and more than 10,000 casualties. \nExpressways account for 20% of the traffic volume, but only 10% of accidents. Comparatively, \nclass I, II, and III highways appear to be 3\u20135 times more dangerous. \n \n                                                 \n3  In 2009, the outstanding balance of those loans in Anhui is CNY16.0 billion at the provincial level, CNY12.0 billion \nat the municipal level, and CNY0.6 billion at lower levels. \n4  World Bank. 2008.

Public Transport. Many public transport services in rural areas in the PRC are provided \nby unlicensed operators, often using vehicles that are unsuitable for the purpose, are not \nproperly maintained, and are not always driven safely. Most rural transport operators tend to \npurchase vehicles with the lowest initial cost, even though their whole-life cycle costs may be \nmuch higher than alternative vehicle types. Anhui Province is characterized by a predominance \nof three-wheelers or seven-seat minibuses; larger vehicles would be more cost-effective. ADB \nTA outlined how the development of more flexible regulatory frameworks adapted to village \ntransportation could allow a regularization of unlicensed operators and foster better access, \naffordability, and safety of rural public transport.5 \n \n11.  Overloading. The important production and demand for raw  materials and primary \nproducts in Anhui generates incentives for truck overloading. Overloading is cited as the major \ncause for the deterioration of the pavement on lower classes of Anhui's road network, which \nwere built according to light technical standards. In 2004, the APG formulated a comprehensive \noverloading  management  program,  combining  enforcement,  weight-based  tolling,  and \ninformation systems upgrade. Efforts reduced the truck overloading rate from more than 80% to \na current 10% on the provincial network. However, important geographic disparities remain and \nthe situation on lower networks is poor. \n \n12.  Private  Sector  Participation.  Anhui  Communications  Investment  Group  Company \nLimited used private financing to develop its trunk road network. Between 1993 and 2004, the \nprivate  sector  was  involved  in  23  projects  involving  bridges,  highways,  and  expressways \nthrough  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  or  build\u2013and\u2013transfer  concession.  However,  many  projects \nincurred financial difficulties after 2004, when the banks tightened their credit, and the provincial \ngovernment had to buy back several projects. Some private contractors have focused on short-\nterm rather than long-term profitability, as they have had little security over their investments: \n(i) contracts are incomplete and weakly enforced, and (ii) provincial toll rates are determined by \nthe Price Bureau on a 5-year basis, independent of the contracts.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.

In  the  road  subsector,  the  World  Bank  (WB)  and  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) have been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national and local road \nnetworks. The WB has provided loans of about $9.4 billion to finance road investments and the \nJICA (provided by Japan Bank for International Cooperation) has provided about \u00a5195.0 billion \nfor  this  purpose.  The  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD) provided cofinancing in the amount of Euro 85 million for road projects in \nthe southwestern region of the PRC. ADB coordinates with these development partners to \ndiscuss progress and issues in the sector. ADB has met regularly with the WB for coordination \nand information sharing. The Government coordinates the activities of different development \npartners and has utilized ADB TA support for researching and influencing a number of policy \ninterventions.

The Project has four components: (i) Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway (XME), (ii) local \nroads and safety improvement, (iii) rural village bus services, and (iv) institutional development \nand capacity building. \n \nA.  Component A: Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway  \n \n2.  The XME is located in the northeast of Anhui Province, close to the border with Jiangsu \nProvince. The XME will be a section of about 139 kilometers (km) of an expressway linking the \nXuzhou area in Jiangsu to Mingguang in Anhui. At the Xuzhou (northern) end, it starts at an \ninterchange  on  the  Xuzhou\u2013Huai\u2019an  Expressway  in  Jiangsu  Province  and  ends  at  an \ninterchange on the Bengbu\u2013Nanjing Expressway in the south. The XME is a priority project of \nthe provincial 11th five-year plan. It forms part of the planned network included in the Central \nRegion  Development  Plan,  which  proposes  a  growth  strategy  for  the  six  central  region \nprovinces\u2014Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shanxi. \n \n3.  The alignment was chosen to minimize impacts on populations and environment, while \nserving  future  urban  development  centers  and  being  cost-effective.  While  the  most  direct \nalignment considered would have crossed the Touhu Lake Nature Reserve, after a multi-criteria \nanalysis of three alternatives, an alignment that completely avoids the natural reserve was \nchosen. The XME was originally proposed as a six-lane carriageway. After review of the traffic \nforecasts, it will now be the four-lane expressway standard with a design speed of 120 km per \nhour, and an overall formation width of 27 meters. The overall cost, including civil works, land \nacquisition, and environmental measures, but excluding contingencies, is $844.8 million, or an \naverage of $6.9 million per km. \n \n4.  The starting point of XME is the provincial border with Jiangsu; construction of an \nadditional 4 km of route is required to connect with the Xuzhou\u2013Huai\u2019an Expressway. The cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis assumes prorated costs and benefits for the additional 4 km. Brief assessments \nof the potential resettlement and environmental impacts of the section within Jiangsu were \nundertaken as it is clearly a \"linked\" project. Jiangsu Provincial Communications Department will \nfinance and complete the 4 km link by 2014 under the existing interprovincial arrangements \nreached in early 2009. \n \nB.  Component B: Local Roads Improvement \n \n5.  Anhui Highway Administration Bureau (AHAB) is undertaking a progressive upgrade of \nthe local road network to support the overall development objectives of Anhui Province. This \nprogram has three objectives: (i) ensure that the condition and capacity of infrastructure meets \ncurrent and future demand needs; (ii) provide quality access to the trunk network to all sectors \nof society by developing a balanced hierarchy of roads linking all major centers, counties, and \ntownships; and (iii) progressively bring the highway infrastructure to modern safety standards. \nThe Project will contribute to the three objectives by financing improvements including road \nupgrading, rehabilitation, and safety enhancement to nine trunk and feeder sections of the \nnetwork. Three of the sections are in relatively poor agricultural districts in the northeast of the \nprovince and will provide access to the XME; four are in the poor mountainous areas in the \nsouthwest of the province; the remaining two will stimulate and serve economic and industrial \ndevelopment in key corridors.

A feasibility stage safety audit reveals that all road sections present significant safety \nhazards, notably at intersections, urban crossings, and for vulnerable traffic (Table A5.2). Also, \npavement on several sections has outlived its useful life and is severely deteriorated.  \n \nTable A5.2: Safety Appraisal of Local Roads \nItem  S105  S312 X056 S318 S304 S309 S209  X044 G206\nHead-on collision  *  *  ***  *  ***  ***  **  **  ** \nLateral collision  ***  ***  ***  *  **  **  *  *  ** \nRear\u2013front collision  **  **  *  *  *  *  *  *  * \nSideswipe  **  **  *  *  *  *  *  *  * \nPedestrians  ***  ***  ***  **  **  **  **  **  ** \nNonmotorized traffic  ***  ***  ***  **  **  **  **  *  ** \nRollover  **  **  **  ***  *  *  ***  ***  *** \nCollision with objects  ***  **  **  **  **  **  **  **  ** \n* = low, ** = medium, *** = high. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; Anhui Provincial Department of Transport. \n \n7.  All roads will receive an in-depth safety treatment (Table A5.3). Additional safety audits \nwill  be  performed  during  detailed  design,  implementation,  and  operation.  Measures  will \nparticularly target safety at intersections, roadside safety, and urban crossings. In urban areas \ncrossed by the project roads, driving speed will be reduced by traffic-calming measures and \nstrictly  enforcing  regulations.  Where  urban  bypasses  are  built,  the  existing  road  sections \ncrossing  urban  centers  will  be  redesigned  for  local  traffic.  In  parallel  to  this  engineering \napproach to road safety, the traffic police will implement a user education program and focus \ntraffic  enforcement  in  the  project  area  based  on  recommendations  agreed  during  project \nformulation.  Continued  consulting  services  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  institutional \nstrengthening component. \n \nTable A5.3: Road Infrastructure Safety Enhancement Measures \n  Cost\nItems  Detailed Measures  (CNY million)\nIntersection  Channelization and speed tables.

The objective of this component is to implement on a pilot basis the recommendations of \nthe  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services  Study  (Asian  Development  Bank  technical \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \nassistance).1 The reforms proposed by the study support the provision of sustainable, safe, \nreliable, adequate, and affordable public transport services in rural areas without the need for \ngovernment  subsidy  other  than  in  exceptional  circumstances.  The  principal  strategic \nrecommendations that could be applied under the Project are to \n \n(i)  encourage the development of local bus operators based in townships that would \nhave the exclusive right to provide a coordinated network of bus services to \nsurrounding villages; and \n(ii)  amend the licensing regulations applicable to bus services between townships \nand villages, and between villages, to permit greater flexibility in the use of \nvehicles, fares charged, and type of vehicles used. This involves the creation of \nthree new licensing arrangements: village bus operator license, village bus route \nlicense, and village bus license. \n \n9.  Three  representative  townships  were  selected  to  pilot  the  study  recommendations, \nbased  on  discussions  with  stakeholders  and  fields  visits.  Initial  implementation  will  be \nundertaken in Shipai (Huaining county) and Ducun (Qingyang county), which present the double \nadvantage of being geographically close for easier implementation of the reforms, and of having \na wide variety of informal transport services. Based on the lessons of the first two demonstration \nprojects, a third pilot will be undertaken in Xiaowei (Wuhe county). The main activities involved \nin the demonstration projects are \n \n(i)  establish a project development group for each township, chaired by the county \nadministration and including all stakeholders, to oversee the Project (para. 10) \n(ii)  provide detailed briefings for and consultations with all parties affected (several \nrounds of consultations were conducted during project preparation); \n(iii)  select and support the setup of a suitable company or group to operate services \nunder the village bus route license \n(iv)  draft the necessary decrees and dispensations; \n(v)  select the routes to be included in the village bus route license, and define \nstopping places and minimum service frequencies if considered necessary; \n(vi)  draft the conditions attached to a village bus operation license and village bus \nroute license, and issue temporary licenses to the village bus operator; \n(vii)  draft  the  conditions  attached  to  a  village  bus  license,  and  issue  temporary \nlicenses to bus owners wanting to join the village bus operator; \n(viii)  adjust the role and procedures of the Communications Bureau; and \n(ix)  evaluate the results of the pilot project, and prepare for replication. \n \n10.  Two project development groups were set up, one each in Shipei and Ducun, during \nproject preparation. The groups are chaired by the head of the county administration to oversee \nthe Project; membership includes representatives of the Transport Administration Bureau, the \nhead of the township administration, the bus companies operating the routes to the county \ncenter,  any  existing  terminal  operators  (if  separate  from  the  county  bus  operator)  and \nrepresentatives  of  bus  users.  When  the  village  bus  operator  to  be  assigned  the  future \nresponsibility for operating the village bus route licenses is identified, its representative should \nbe appointed to the respective project development group. The groups will have the authority to \nrecommend  implementation  of  regulatory  changes.  Continuous  consulting  services  will  be \nprovided  during  implementation  to  develop  and  agree  on  necessary  procedures  and \ndocumentation. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

The power to move a vehicle comes from burning fuel in an engine. The main products \nof  the  combustion  process  are  carbon  dioxide  and  water,  but  inefficiencies  and  high \ntemperatures  inherent  in  engine  operation  also  produce  other  by-products  such  as \nhydrocarbons,  oxides  of  nitrogen,  carbon  monoxide,  particulate  matter,  and  their  chemical \ncompounds. The emission of pollutants has global and regional social, environmental, and \neconomic impacts. Excessive carbon dioxide emissions increase global warming and cause \n \nclimate  change;  nitrogen  oxides  play  a  major  role  in  the  formation  of  acid  rain  in  the \natmosphere, and particulate matter damages human beings health. Vehicle emissions have a \ndirect  and  adverse  impact  on  health  and  the  environment.  Reducing  vehicle  emissions  to \nimprove air quality is an important challenge that must be addressed in transport projects. \n \n2.  In general, the vehicle emission from individual vehicles depends on various factors, \nincluding the maintenance of the vehicle, driving behavior, and road and traffic conditions. \nReduction of emission pollutants was estimated by comparing the case with and without the \nProject. Without the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing road, which will be more \ncongested, engines will consume more fuel and produce more pollutants as a result of slow-\nmoving traffic, inefficient stop-and-go travel, and longer engine running times. With the Project, \ntraffic will benefit from shorter distance, optimal alignment, and less congestion. Vehicles will \noperate efficiently without stop-and-go, which will result in lower fuel consumption and less \nemission of pollutants. Smooth traffic flows will raise fuel efficiency on the project roads and \nreduce emissions.  \n \n3.  The Project will increase the efficiency of energy use, which will reduce vehicle emission \nper unit of transport. The estimation of vehicle emissions is based on the relationship of fuel \nconsumption, emission of pollutants, and vehicle average speed. The average fuel saving is \nestimated about 65,572 tons of oil equivalent (toe) per year and carbon dioxide reduction is \nabout  211,090 toe  per  year.  On  average,  emission  reductions  will  be  the  following: \nhydrocarbons,  2,433  toe  per  year;  nitrogen  oxides,  2,064;  carbon  monoxide,  4,647;  and \nparticulate matter, 50,341. \n \n4.  Anhui Provincial People\u2019s Government is committed to adhering to the national vehicle \nemission control strategies and plans, which include (i) enforcing stricter emission standards by \nJuly 2010 (GB18352-3-2005 and GB17691-2005 that are equivalent to step IV of European \nemission standards); (ii) enforce inspection and maintenance programs for all existing vehicles, \nincluding (a) annual emission checks and random roadside testing, (b) require emission control \ndevices to be repaired, updated, and installed if the vehicle can\u2019t meet the standard, (c) develop \na quality audit system to guarantee the quality of testing and prevent fraud and corruption, \n(d) upgrade  vehicle  testing  facilities,  and  (e)  promote  environmental  awareness  regarding \nvehicle  emission  and  fuel  consumption;  (iii)  encourage  the  use  of  cleaner  fuel;  (iv) force \nretirement of vehicles that are more than 8\u201310 years old and have failed the emission inspection \ntest three consecutive times;7 and (v) encourage retirement of old vehicles through subsidy. \nTable A7 provides an integrated plan developed to help agencies reduce vehicle emissions in \nAnhui. \n                                                 \n7  On the vehicle emission spectrum, the older model vehicles and vehicles with poorly maintained or malfunctioning \nemission control equipment emit a large percentage of the pollution from on road vehicles. \n ", "  Appendix 7  43 \nTable A7: Strategic Vehicle Emission Reduction Plan: Targets and Expected Outputs \n      Expected  Responsible \nTarget  Proposed Action  Schedule  Output  Agency \nA.

The proposed Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway (XME) is located in the northeast of \nAnhui Province, close to the border with Jiangsu Province. The XME will be a 139-kilometer \n(km) four-lane expressway linking the Xuzhou area in Jiangsu to Mingguang in Anhui, thus \ncompleting  a  key  link  in  the  Xuzhou\u2013Nanjing  corridor.  The  present  design  includes  five \ninterchanges plus six reserve sites to connect the local road network. The design speed is \n120 km per hour (km/h). The XME will be a shorter route between Xuzhou and Nanjing, two \nimportant transport hubs in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). It will provide an optimized \nlink in the Xuzhou\u2013Nanjing corridor to release traffic congestion in the near future. The XME is a \npriority project of the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan. \n \n2.  The start point of the XME is the provincial border with Jiangsu Province in the north, \nwith its 4 km extension to the Xuzhou\u2013Suqian\u2013Huai'an\u2013Nanjing Expressway (Xusuning), and \nends at an interchange in Mingguang on the Bengbu\u2013Nanjing Expressway in the south. The \nXME will parallel the existing national highway (NH104), which was upgraded to class II in the \nlate 1980s with a 12-meter width of road pavement. The pavement is generally fair, but the road \nis  poorly  aligned  with  substantial  ribbon  development.  Its  technical  standard  confines  the \naverage speed on the road and road capacity. The average daily motorized traffic in 2008 was \nabout 6,500 vehicles and the average speed on the road less than 50 km/h. The existing road is \nsaturated and cannot meet the rapidly increasing traffic demand. \n \n3.  The XME will provide a shorter and direct route between Xuzhou, Mingguang, and \nNanjing and beyond. The distance savings are 50 km from Xuzhou\u2013Hefei (Hehu) route via \nBengbu, 28 km from Xusuning via Suqian, and 30 km from route of NH104. Traffic will be \nredistributed upon the project completion. By 2014, Xusuning will mainly serve the traffic to or \nfrom Huai\u2019an and Lanyungang (an important seaport in the PRC); and the Xuhe will mainly \nserve traffic to or from Hefei, the capital city of Anhui. \n \n4.  The base year for establishing the road network is taken as 2008. Future road networks \nare derived for the project opening year of 2014 and 2020. The traffic origin\u2013destination survey \nand count survey were undertaken in 2007, and updated in 2008. According to the survey and \nanalysis results, internal traffic in the direct influence areas of the Project accounts for 50%, \ntraffic between internal and external areas accounts for 32%, and the external cross-boundary \ntraffic accounts for 18%. Much of the traffic on NH104 would be short- or medium-distance \ntraffic with either an origin or destination in the immediate areas.  \n \n5.  The traffic forecast for the XME uses a standard four-stage travel demand model, based \non 47 zones, including 25 zones in the immediate influence areas, and remainder zones in the \nindirect influence areas. The model assigns traffic between each of zones to anticipated road \nnetworks for two scenarios, with and without the XME, in the series of forecast years. Traffic \nforecasts are based on an analysis of economic growth, population, and vehicle ownership. \nTraffic demand is projected separately for passenger and freight vehicle for 2014, 2021, and \n2033, from the base year of origin and destination matrix and demand elasticity of 1.0 and 0.9. \n \n6.  The traffic forecasts allow for potential generated and diverted traffic as a result of  \n(i) additional traffic generated by the Project because of the lower trip costs in the corridor; and \n(ii) potential diverted traffic from other road networks because of the more direct and shorter \nroute to or from same origin and destination. Generated traffic is estimated using price elasticity \n ", "    Appendix 12  51 \nof minus 0.3 for passenger traffic and minus 0.2 for freight traffic, and is projected to be 10% of \nnormal passenger traffic and 8% of normal freight traffic. \n \n7.  Traffic is assigned between every pair of traffic zones. Vehicles moving from one zone to \nanother make a choice of link paths based on their perceptions of generalized costs of travel on \nthe expressway and its parallel route, a function of travel time, distance, associated toll cost, \nand affected by road conditions and traffic congestion. The diverted traffic from existing roads is \ncalculated using multiple paths with the capacity restraints trip assignment model. The results of \nthe analysis indicate that an average of 28% of vehicles may be diverted to the XME from the \nXuhe Expressway (21% in 2022), 35% of the vehicles diverted from the Xusuning (32% in \n2022), and the rest diverted from the NH104 in 2014 (47% in 2022).  \n \n8.  Traffic projection considers the effect of the railway network changes. The high-speed \npassenger railway of Beijing to Shanghai will divert some traffic from the Xuzhou\u2013Nanjing road \ncorridor.  According  to  the  feasibility  study  of  the  high-speed  railway,  the  railway  origin\u2013\ndestination and travel distance are quite different from project expressway, and traffic diversions \nto the railway are limited. Analysis show that traffic diversions to the railway are 598 passenger \ncar units (pcu) per day in the opening year and 841 pcu per day in the end of analysis year. \n \n9.  A \"ramp-up\" factor was built in to take into account the experience in previous projects \nthat traffic gradually builds up and often the full potential traffic is not realized for a few years. To \nestimate this effect, the assumptions are made as follows: 75% of the expected flow for 2014 \nand 90% in 2015. Traffic on the XME is forecast to be around 12,000 pcu/day in the year of \nopening, and increasing to around 29,000 pcu/day by 2021. The forecast annual growth rate at \nthe initial period of operation is 8%, dropping to 5% between 2021 and 2026, and 4% beyond. \nThe XME will be shorter than the existing routes between Xuzhou, Mingguang, and Nanjing; it \nwill cut travel time by up to 35 minutes for traffic diverting from existing expressways, and by up \nto 45 minutes for traffic diverting from the local road network. Generated traffic is expected to \nremain minor (Table A12.1). \n \nTable A12.1: Traffic Volumes on the Corridor  \n(pcu/day) \nItem  2008 2014 2021 2026  2033\nA.

Economic Analysis \n \n10.  The cost\u2013benefit analysis of the Project takes into account the capital costs and road \nmaintenance  costs,  and  benefits  from  road  user  cost  savings,  which  are  derived  from  a \ncomparison of the without-project and with-project scenarios. Without the Project, vehicles will \ncontinue to use the existing road network, which will be more congested and result in increased \ntravel time, vehicle operating cost (VOC), and road accidents. With the Project, the corridor \ncapacity will be significantly increased and road congestion will be relieved; vehicles will benefit \nfrom faster, cheaper, and safer travels. The HDM-4 model, a comprehensive road assessment \nprogram, was used to evaluate the road user costs. The economic evaluation uses 2009 prices, \nexpressed in CNY using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.03 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67, considering the lower \nproductivity and unemployment in the project area, is applied to convert the financial costs of \nunskilled labor into economic costs. \n \n11.  Possible  alternative  interventions  were  considered  to  meet  the  growing  transport \ndemand in the project area. Alternative analysis reviewed various options in terms of transport \nmodes, alignments, technical designs, timing of investments, and financing modalities. Options \nwere evaluated in light of environmental impacts, effects on land acquisition and resettlement, \ntraffic flow and safety, and project costs. The recommended project road location and alignment \noption  were  selected  after  the  analysis.  Alternative  financing  modalities  were  considered, \nincluding private sector investment. However, private sector investment was not found attractive \ndue to risks associated with construction and low estimated rates of return. Hence, public \nfinancing was considered appropriate. \n \n  1.  Costs \n \n12.  The  economic  costs  include  (i)  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingency,  land \nacquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation costs; (ii) costs of operation and \nmaintenance;  and  (iii)  costs  for  periodic  maintenance  and  replacement  of  depreciated \nequipment. The economic costs are derived from financial costs by (i) excluding taxes and \nduties, (ii) converting the cost of imported items to domestic prices using the shadow exchange \nrate factor, and (iii) converting unskilled labor costs using the shadow wage rate. \n \n  2.  Benefits \n \n13.  Project benefits result from improvements in road and traffic conditions as assessed by \ncomparing with-project and without-project scenarios. The economic benefits include (i) savings \nin VOC, (ii) savings in the value of passenger time tied up in transit, (iii) savings resulting from \nfewer accidents, (iv) benefits to generated traffic, and (v) benefits from the reduction of carbon \ndioxide (CO ) emission. These benefits are considered relevant and possible to quantify with \n2\nsufficient accuracy for inclusion in the appraisals.  \n \n14.  VOC savings allow for differences in roughness, terrain, speed, and congestion; as well \nas changing vehicle compositions for passenger and freight vehicles, and improvements in the \nvehicle\u2019s performance. Traffic on the project roads will enjoy higher travel speeds on a smooth \nroad with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less congestion, and shorter travel distance. \nSavings in VOC is a main source of economic benefits. \n \n15.  Travel time savings are obtained when road improvements lead to an increase in vehicle \nspeeds, thus reducing the journey times of passengers. Since the costs of driver and crew are \nincluded as a component of VOC, the time savings focus on passengers. Value time savings \n ", "    Appendix 12  53 \nconsider passenger trips that are work-related and non-work-related, combined with an average \npassenger load per vehicle and produces a passenger time cost per vehicle hour. The values \nused per passenger-hour are CNY9.1 for car passengers and CNY2.4 for bus passengers. Time \nsavings for freight cargos were not quantified because of the lack of reliable data. \n \n16.  Accident cost savings are based in part of an analysis of national accident statistics for \n2008, which were used to establish the accident rate on the expressway and part of the \naccident data for existing roads. The average accident rate on the expressway is 0.2\u20130.5 million \nvehicle-km and 1.0\u20131.2 million vehicle-km for the national highway. The economic costs of \naccidents are estimated in terms of direct life and property damage, and forgone income on the \nbasis of national data for 2008. The average unit cost of accidents is CNY112,000 on the \nexpressways and CNY86,500 on the national highway. The benefits of generated traffic are \nestimated at half the VOC and time savings of normal traffic as a proxy for willingness to pay. \n \n17.  Benefits from reduced vehicle emission were obtained from saving on fuel consumption. \nVehicles  can  drive  at  the  economic  speed  and  shorter  distances  after  project  completion, \nresulting in less fuel consumption, and CO  and harmful gases emissions. Under provisions of \n2\nthe  Kyoto  Protocol,  certified  emission  reductions  are  presently  valued  in  the  PRC  at \napproximately $10 per ton of CO  reduced. Other pollutant reduction benefits are attributable to \n2\nthe Project (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and suspended particles), which \nare not quantified in the benefits stream. \n \n  3.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n18.  The Project as a whole generates an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nof 15.8% (Table A12.2). The EIRR is 15.5% for the project expressway and 16.9% for the \nproject local roads. The VOC savings are the major economic benefits (53%), followed by time \nsavings benefits, generated traffic benefits, and other benefits. Reductions in accident costs and \nthe value of savings in CO  emissions are relatively small. The benefits of the local roads \n2\naccount for 23% of the total benefits.  \n \n4.  Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n \n19.  The  results  of  sensitivity  analysis confirm  the  robustness  of  the  project\u2019s economic \nviability (Table A12.3). The capital cost would have to be 64% higher than estimated for the \nEIRR to fall to the cutoff rate of 12%. The economic analysis model performed the risk analysis \nbased  on  triangular  probability  distribution  for  the  main  input  parameters.  Under  the  tests \nconducted, if the benefits are allowed to be 50% of their most likely values, the EIRR will fall \nbelow 12%. Considering the experience of ADB in the PRC, such an increase in capital cost or \nreduction in benefits is unlikely. \n \n5.  Distribution Analysis \n \n20.  A  distribution  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  project  effects  for  various \nbeneficiaries, including road users, labor, and government. Road users will receive the largest \nshare of net benefit, accounting for 87% (50% for passenger traffic and 37% for freight traffic) of \nthe total net benefits. \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(CNY million) \n  Costs    Benefits\n        Generated Local  Net\nYear  Capital  O&M       VOC   Time Accident Traffic CO   Roads  Benefit\n2\n2010  813.5  0.0    0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0  0.0  (813.5) \n2011  2,367.7  0.0    0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0  0.0  (2,367.7) \n2012  1,656.1  0.0    0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0  0.0  (1,656.1) \n2013  2,224.7  0.0    0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0  0.0  (2,224.7) \n2014  703.0  34.8    252.1  31.5  19.4  78.7  0.3  51.3  (304.5) \n2015  0.0  51.1    357.4  53.1  34.1  86.6  0.5  241.1  721.7 \n2016  0.0  53.2    445.4  72.9  46.7  95.3  0.6  267.7  875.4 \n2017  0.0  55.4    498.6  87.8  50.6  104.7  0.7  293.7  980.8 \n2018  0.0  57.7    558.2  105.7  54.9  115.0  0.9  329.3  1,106.3 \n2019  0.0  60.1    624.8  127.3  59.5  126.4  1.0  356.3  1,235.2 \n2020  0.0  62.6    699.4  153.2  64.6  138.9  1.2  392.1  1,386.8 \n2021  182.2  65.2    782.9  184.5  70.0  152.6  1.4  433.2  1,377.2 \n2022  108.6  68.0    929.0  217.0  76.0  161.5  1.8  480.3  1,688.9 \n2023  153.7  70.8    1,102.3  255.3  82.5  170.9  2.3  530.6  1,919.3 \n2024  0.0  73.8    1,307.9  300.3  89.5  180.8  2.9  580.1  2,387.7 \n2025  0.0  76.9    1,552.0  353.2  97.2  191.4  3.6  635.1  2,755.5 \n2026  0.0  80.1    1,841.5  415.5  105.5  202.5  4.5  696.7  3,186.1 \n2027  0.0  83.5    2,051.8  471.7  110.6  209.6  5.2  765.4  3,530.6 \n2028  0.0  87.1    2,286.1  535.4  116.0  216.8  5.9  834.7  3,907.9 \n2029  0.0  90.8    2,547.1  607.8  121.7  224.3  6.8  893.9  4,310.8 \n2030  182.2  94.7    2,837.9  690.0  127.6  232.1  7.8  957.7  4,576.2 \n2031  141.7  98.7    3,162.0  783.3  133.8  240.2  8.9  995.3  5,082.9 \n2032  200.6  103.0    3,523.0  889.1  140.3  248.5  10.2  1,067.0  5,574.6 \n2033  0.0  84.7    3,925.3  1,009.3  147.2  257.1  11.7  1,189.6  6,238.3 \n2034  (4,435.3)      0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0  0.0  4,435.3 \n          EIRR  15.80%\n          NPV  2,743.4\nCO = carbon dioxide, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and \n2 \nmaintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A12.3: Sensitivity Analysis \nEIRR NPV Switching Valuea \nItem  (%)  (CNY million)  Sensitivity Indicator  (%) \n1.

The financial analysis and projections for the Project were undertaken in accordance \nwith the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis \nof Projects (2005). The Project has both revenue and nonrevenue components. The revenue \ncomponent consists of a toll road project, the Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway (XME), which \nwill be implemented by the Anhui Communications Investment Group Company Limited. Two \nnonrevenue components will be managed by the Anhui Highway Administration Bureau (AHAB) \nand  the  Anhui  Transport  Administration  Bureau  under  the  overall  management  of  Anhui \nProvincial Department of Transport (APDOT).  \n \nA.  Revenue Component of the Project \n \n1.  Financial Projections \n \n2.  Anhui Province uses the standard system, which sets the same toll on all expressways. \nThe regulation on the administration of toll roads came into force on 1 November 2004, and the \ncurrent  toll  rates  have  been  applicable  since  1  January  2005.  Toll  increases  are  under \ndiscussion and the likely increase would to be up to 15%. Financial analysis of the XME uses a \nconservative assumption of zero increase in the base year toll rate in 2009 (Table A13.1). \n \nTable A13.1: Base Year Tolls for Passenger Vehicles in 2009 Prices \n(CNY per vehicle-km) \nVehicle Class  1 2 2 4 \nPassenger vehicles  \u22647 seats 8\u201319 seats 20\u201339 seats >=40  seats \nToll rate   0.40  0.70  1.00  1.20 \nSource: Anhui Provincial Department of Transport. \n \n3.  Anhui Province has been implementing weight-based tolls for freight vehicles since 2005 \n(Table A13.2). The minimum toll rate for freight vehicles is CNY20.  \n \nTable A13.2: Base Year Tolls for Freight Vehicles in 2009 Prices \n(CNY per vehicle-km) \nVehicle Class  1 2 3 \nFreight vehicles  \u226410 tons  10\u201340 tons >40 tons\nToll rate   0.08  Linear decrease up to 0.043  0.043 \nSource: Anhui Provincial Department of Transport. \n \n4.  Periodic maintenance and infrastructure rehabilitation will be required every 9 years. \nDepreciation  is  calculated  using  a  straight  line  method  with  an  average  life  of  40  years. \nCorporate income tax at 25% is paid on income after deducting business taxes, depreciation \nand interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward. \n \n5.  The Project will be funded 40% by equity (32% by Anhui Communications Investment \nGroup Company Limited and the rest by central and provincial governments) and 60% by long-\nterm loans from Industrial Commercial Bank China and ADB. The ADB loan for the XME is for \n$118.5 million. It will have a 25-year term including a 5-year grace period, and be a US dollar \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan with a 0.15% commitment fee. The projected \nfinancial statements (Table A13.3) indicate that forecast revenue under the base assumptions is \nsufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, and debt repayments on the ADB and \ndomestic bank loans; and generate reasonable profits. \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \n2.  Financial Analysis \n \n6.  The major assumptions used to calculate a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) include \n(i) all calculations are based on 2009 prices, covering 2010\u20132033; (ii) capital costs include all \nincremental capital expenditures related to construction and equipment for the expressway, but \nexclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operating costs include all \nannual incremental expenses incurred in operating the XME, but exclude depreciation and debt \npayments; and (iv) a residual value equal to the net book value of capital investment. \n \n7.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after-tax, in real terms, was \ncalculated using estimated capital mix and cost of funds. Costs considered include (i) the \napplicable 5-year LIBOR fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.2% is used for \nADB debt; (ii) the present interest rate of 5.94% per annum is used for the domestic bank loans; \nand (iii) the opportunity cost of equity capital is assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income tax of 25%. The nominal cost is converted to the real cost by \napplying domestic long-term inflation rates for local currency and international inflation rates for \nforeign exchange denominated debt. \n8.  The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.6% (Table A13.4), which \ncompares favorably with the WACC, computed at an after-tax basis at 3.7%. The Project is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate conditions causing \nthe Project's viability to fall below the WACC are unlikely to occur. The sensitivity of the Project's \nfinancial indicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table A13.5. \n3.  Summary XME Financial Results \n \n9.  The financial projections show that even with tolls not increasing with inflation there \nwould be no cash flow deficits and the debt service coverage ratio from the start is above the \nADB norm of a 1.2 after the third year of the XME opening to traffic. Similarly, without toll \nincreases and after tax, FIRR would be 6.6%, well above the 3.7% WACC. With an inflationary \ntoll increase, the situation will further improve. Hence, it can be concluded that the expressway \nproject is financially sustainable and viable.  \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Nonrevenue Components of the Project \n \n10.  Only the XME component of the Project is expected to earn revenue. Other project \ncomponents are (i) upgrading and rehabilitation of local roads, to be performed by AHAB;  \n(ii) a rural transport pilot project to be carried out by Anhui Transport Administration Bureau, and \n(iii) institutional capacity development. Even though class I roads in the country are generally \nrevenue-earning, the AHAB-administered local road upgrading from class II to class I under this \nProject are too short to be tolled. Financial evaluation of the nonrevenue components focuses \non fiscal impact on the operating entity. \n \n11.  The financial data confirm the availability of sufficient counterpart funds and the capacity \nof APDOT and AHAB to finance both investment in the Project, and future maintenance and \noperating expenses for the project roads. The analysis shows that the fiscal impact and risks \nare modest. The total capital required for the nonrevenue project components represents only \n0.4% of past annual APDOT revenues. \n \n12.  The total project annual expenditure relating to the nonrevenue components will be only \n2% of the average annual expenditure of APDOT from 2003 to 2008. This represents about \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \n10%  of  the  total  AHAB  expenditure  in  2008,  corresponding  to  11%  of  average  annual \nexpenditure  of  AHAB  in  the  past 3  years.  Similarly,  operation  and maintenance,  including \nperiodic maintenance, of the upgraded and rehabilitated local road components will represent \n4.3% of AHAB\u2019s annual historic costs for these items. \n \n13.  Full debt payments on the nonrevenue component when they become due in 2015 will \nbe 12.4% of APDOT's total debt payments and 1% of the total revenue of APDOT in 2008. \nThese low financial ratios indicate that the Project presents a very modest financial risk with \nrespect to (i) availability of resources to cover the project cost; (ii) operation and maintenance \nneeds, (iii) loan service requirements for the project roads, and (iv) financial burdens to the \nprovince. \n \n ", " \nTable A13.3: Projected Financial Statements  5\n8\n(CNY million)   \nItem  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015  2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\nIncome Statement                          A\np\n  Toll Revenue  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  365.5  480.2  589.7  658.3  734.7  820.1  915.4  1,021.7  p\ne\n  Interest Income on Cash Balance  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.1  0.9  3.7  5.8  8.2  10.7  13.6  16.7  n\nd\n  Less: Taxes on Turnover  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  20.1  26.5  32.6  36.5  40.9  45.7  51.1  57.1  ix\n  Total Net Gross Revenue  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  345.5  454.7  560.8  627.6  702.0  785.1  877.9  981.4   1\n3\n  Total Operating Costs  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  29.6  31.1  32.7  34.3  36.0  37.8  39.7  41.7   \n                         \n  Depreciation Expenses  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  159.1  155.4  151.8  148.2  144.8  141.4  138.1  134.9 \n  Interest Charge: Long-Term Debt  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  214.7  208.4  201.8  194.8  187.5  179.8  171.7  163.2 \n  Interest Charge: Short-Term Debt  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  1.8  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \n  Corporate Income Tax  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  43.6  62.5  83.4  106.5  132.1  160.4 \n  Appropriations of Net Income  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  50.0  109.5  156.9  209.2  267.1  331.2  402.2 \n  Retained Earnings (Loss)  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  (59.7)  9.8  21.5  30.8  41.0  52.4  65.0  78.9 \n                         \nBalance Sheet                         \nAssets                         \n  Current Assets  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  7.4  47.1  185.5  292.0  408.2  536.3  678  837.2 \n  Net Fixed Assets  879.8  3,500.3  5,447.0  6,833.0  6,673.9  6,518.6  6,366.8  6,218.6  6,073.8  5,932.4  5,794.3  5,659.4 \n    Total Assets  879.8 3,500.3 5,447.0 6,833.0 6,681.3 6,565.6  6,552.3 6,510.6 6,482.1 6,468.7 6,472.7 6,496.6\nLiabilities and Equity                         \n  Current Liabilities  0.0  0.0  0.0  132.5  179.3  188.4  286.2  350.0  420.1  497.2  582.1  675.8 \n  Long-Term Liabilities  564.8  2,270.1  3,483.0  4,189.5  4,050.7  3,905.4  3,753.1  3,593.4  3,426.1  3,250.7  3,066.8  2,873.9 \n  Equity  315.0  1,230.3  1,964.1  2,511.0  2,451.3  2,471.9  2,513.1  2,567.1  2,635.8  2,720.8  2,823.8  2,946.9 \n    Total Liabilities and Equity  879.8 3,500.3 5,447.0 6,833.0 6,681.3 6,565.6  6,552.3 6,510.6 6,482.1 6,468.7 6,472.7 6,496.6\n                         \nCash Flow Statement                         \nSources of Funds                         \n  Total Internal Cash Generation  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  337.5  450.1  560.8  629.8  706.9  793.1  889.3  996.9 \n  Total External Financing  879.8  2,620.5  1,946.7  1,386.0  37.4  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \n    Total Source of Funds  879.8 2,620.5 1,946.7 1,386.0 374.8 450.1  560.8 629.8 706.9 793.1 889.3 996.9\nApplication of Funds                         \n  Total Construction of Project  879.8  2,620.5  1,946.7  1,386.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \n  Total Debt Service  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  349.0  384.5  347.2  347.2  347.2  347.2  347.2  347.2 \n  Total Distributions  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  18.4  25.9  75.3  176.2  243.5  317.9  400.0  491.0 \n    End of Year Cash  0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 7.4 47.1  185.5 292.0 408.2 536.3 678.4 837.2\n                         \nRatio Analysis                         \nDebt-Service Coverage Ratio  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  0.91  1.10  1.52  1.71  1.92  2.15  2.41  2.71 \nDebt\u2013Equity Ratio (%)  64  65  64  63  63  62  61  59  58  56  54  51 \nWorking Ratio (%)  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  9  7  6  5  5  5  5  4 \nSources: Anhui Provincial Department of Transport;

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Project will continue engagement with the central and provincial governments in the transport sector, which is \nconsidered a key intervention area for poverty reduction in Anhui Province. Anhui, as the least developed province in the \ncentral People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), is a key province of the central Government for poverty reduction because of the \nconcentration of poor in the Dabie Mountain area in the southwest and in the flood-prone Huaibei Plain in the northeast. The \nProject will construct an expressway in the northeast and upgrade or rehabilitate nine existing roads, of which seven are in \nthese two poor areas. The Project will provide more reliable and safe transport services to local people, which will contribute \nto economic development, livelihood improvement, and indirect poverty reduction. \n \nThe Project will directly contribute to implementation of the PRC\u2019s central region development strategy. The main strategies \nof the program include (i) revitalizing old industrial cities; (ii) accelerating formation of the central manufacturing area; \n(iii) promoting economic cooperation between the central regions; (iv) strengthening the driving effects of central city circles; \nand (v) constructing a growth pole in the central area by resultant force. Under the program, Anhui intends to be the priority \nreceiver of shifting industries from the coastal region. The proposed expressway and local roads will play important roles in \nfulfilling all the strategies for Anhui and for the whole central region. Improved access to eastern cities will attract more labor-\nintensive industries.  \n \nAlso, the Project is consistent with the ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy, especially pillar I\u2014inclusive growth and \nbalanced development. Under pillar I, the strategy states that \u201cADB will help the PRC build a harmonious society and boost \nrural development.\u201d Operations will be concentrated in the areas where growth and development are lagging, focusing on \ncentral and western provinces. To help the PRC maximize benefits from urbanization and put the economy on a sustainable \ngrowth path, ADB will continue to assist investments in transport, including expressways and railways, needed to integrate \nthe domestic economy and boost the services sector.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nAnhui\u2019s rural poverty incidence (purchasing power parity $1.25) of 10.5% in 2007 is slightly higher than the national average \nof 10.0%. Poverty is concentrated in the Dabie Mountain area and in Huaibei Plain. Huaibei Plain is a major grain production \narea, however its flood-prone nature has restricted its economic development; also, agriculture alone cannot support high \nincome. The main causes of poverty are high population density and limited nonagriculture employment, which results in a \nlarge surplus of rural laborers. Underdeveloped transport is also considered one of the major causes of poverty, especially in \nthe southwest. Consequently, investment in the highway and local roads network is a key intervention for poverty reduction. \n \nThe Project targets both poverty pockets of Anhui, and will significantly help local people and governments to overcome the \ntransport barriers and improve transport services and road safety. As a consequence, it will directly and indirectly contribute \nto poverty reduction. Six of the 14 project beneficiary counties are designated as national or provincial poverty counties in \nAnhui that will directly benefit from the Project. Rural poverty incidence (based on purchasing power parity $1.25) of \n14 project counties averages 10%. However, the poverty incidence in Yuexi is very high (29.5%) and will benefit directly from \nthe rehabilitation of local road S209. Also, the expressway and upgrading of local road X056 will directly benefit Lingbi and \nSixian counties, which have a poverty incidence of 19.6% and 18%, respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of people \nearning less than $2/day (CNY2,500) is 25.2% on average for the 14 project counties: 59.8% in Yuexi, 56.8% in Qianshan, \n34.7% in Lingbi, and 34.0% in Sixian. Consequently, economic development needs to be targeted at these densely \npopulated poverty areas. \n \nIn addition to improved transport and access conditions to and from the project area, the Project will contribute to poverty \nreduction, local economic growth, and social development by facilitating (i) local urbanization, (ii) industrialization in industrial \nparks along the future expressway, (iii) agricultural and animal production through better market access and through setting \nup processing enterprises, (iv) tourism development in the Dabie Mountain area; (v) employment of locals as unskilled \nlaborers during project construction, and (vi) government social development programs and initiatives that can be integrated \nwith the project resettlement and rehabilitation measures. \n  \n2.  Design Features \nThe highway sections crossing the township centers along the poverty roads will be properly designed with safety and other \nnecessary facilities to enable better and safer operations of local markets. A social development action plan (SDAP) has \nbeen formulated and includes complementary poverty reduction measures that will be implemented by local government. \nThe timing of these programs with the project interventions will accelerate the benefits for the poor. Since the Project \nconstruction will require a significant amount of unskilled labor, available surplus laborers will be identified by the labor \nbureaus and hiring arrangements will be made with the project contractors. Such workers will receive training and gain \nvaluable skills that will make them more employable after the Project. These and other social development measures are \npresented in the SDAP to improve the inclusiveness of the Project. \n ", "    Appendix 14  61 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nSimilar to many other areas in the PRC, although the project counties are basically rural, agriculture is no longer the \nbackbone of local economies. The contribution of the primary sector or agriculture to total gross domestic product ranges \nfrom 12.3% to 50.5% among these counties. In the expressway areas, the primary sector still accounts for 40%\u201350% \nbecause few industries are currently located there. This could change significantly due to improved transport access, \navailability of abundant low cost labor, and the government policy to shift industry from the coastal areas. Twelve of the 14 \nproject counties have per capita gross domestic product below the provincial average; 6 of the 14 project counties have rural \nper capita income below the provincial average. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit 4.0 million local people, of whom 90% are rural residents. No ethnic minority villages are in \nthe project area. All government agencies, townships, villages, households, industrial park, and industrial enterprises \nconsulted and interviewed support the Project. Three local roads to be rehabilitated will benefit three national poverty \ncounties in the southwest. The new expressway and the upgrading of local road X056 will benefit two provincial poverty \ncounties in the northeast. \n \nThe potential adverse social impacts from the Project include (i) land acquisition and resettlement, (ii) increased accidents \ndue to higher speeds and mixed traffic, (iii) transmissible diseases spread by the large construction workforce, and \n(iv) disruption to local communities during construction. The expressway project area is densely populated, so there will be \nno adverse impact to businesses along the existing road network. \n \nRegarding transport services, many informal service providers use vehicles that are consider unsafe, yet provide a source of \nincome for many people and provide low cost transport service. To address this issue, two counties have been selected as \npilot projects for transport services to improve quality and safety, and possibly permit some informal services that satisfy \nbasic safety standards. \n \nSince Anhui Province has more developed government services and a strong All-China Women's Federation, this Project \noffers potential to enhance implementation quality and project benefits through greater coordination and involvement of key \nagencies, such as labor and social security, traffic police, centers for disease control, and tourism. There is also potential to \ninvolve local communities in project design, implementation, and monitoring, since this region has higher education levels \nand greater awareness of modern transport services due to close proximity to Jiangsu and Shanghai. Also, local agencies \nhave already adopted many of the proposed social measures, so the main issue is to determine what measures are most \nimportant and ensure they are being implemented in an adequate and timely manner. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \nAbout 140 villages from 40 townships in 12 project counties were consulted during the project preparatory TA in the process \nof the socioeconomic survey for social analysis and resettlement planning. Provincial and county government agencies \nconsulted include transport bureaus, development and reform committees, poverty reduction offices, women\u2019s federations, \nagricultural bureaus, land administration bureaus, labor and social security bureaus, civil affairs bureaus, and tourism \nbureaus. In addition, an industrial park and an enterprise within the park were consulted. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \nFor road and traffic safety design on two Class I roads, it is planned to have collaborative decision making with the local \ncommunities.  \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nContinuous consultation will be done with stakeholders during the detailed design and construction stages led by Anhui \nCommunications Investment Group Company Limited, AHAB, and Anhui Transport Administration Bureau. This will involve \nother local agencies, local communities, and affected people. For project implementation, the SDAP includes some key \nsocial measures that will require consultation and participation. Also, the four resettlement plans include C&P plans, \nparticularly to consult with villagers on how to avoid or minimize impacts during construction.  \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. The Project will not entail disparities and inequalities between men\u2019s and women\u2019s access to the project \nroads and transport services, to the contrary women could benefit more from the Project\u2019s safety improvement measures in \nthe towns and villages traversed by the Project's local roads because women, children, and the elderly are the main \npedestrians. Environmentally sustainable transport services will result in additional benefits for the community especially for \nwomen and children. \n \nWomen and men have different roles and responsibilities that lead to differences in division of labor, needs, and preferences. \nWomen  and  men  also  participate  differently  in  various  social  activities.  The  presumption  that  domestic  role  and \nresponsibilities are women\u2019s primary function can cause barriers for them to participate effectively in various community \nactivities and income-generating opportunities. This also leads to differential access to and control over facilities and \nservices available in the community. These issues need to be addressed adequately to ensure that provision of rural roads \nand services will also directly benefit women. \n ", "62  Appendix 14 \nThe Project will provide necessary provisions for empowering women throughout the project cycle, and anticipates continued \nparticipation of women during planning, implementation, and postconstruction activities. \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process:  \n    Gender plan           Other actions/measures (see Gender Analysis)        No action/measure \n \nThe SDAP includes measures to (i) increase women\u2019s participation in project preparation and implementation activities; \n(ii) include women in the design of road and traffic safety for the local roads, (iii) encourage women to provide food service to \ncontractors, (iv) hire women for reforestation and landscaping along roadways, (v) hire women for toll booths along the \nexpressway, (vi) improve the cleanliness and lighting for bus stations, (vii) monitor the protection of women's rights regarding \nlabor and re-registration of land and property rights, and (viii) improve women's awareness of transmissible diseases. The \nSDAP monitoring and reporting includes sex-disaggregated baseline data and gender-specific indicators that form part of the \nproject performance monitoring system.  \n \nThese measures will be supported by relevant local government agencies and the All-China Women's Federation, which \nalready include many of these measures in their routine activities. \n \nIII.

The Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway (XME) and three upgraded roads (S312, S105, \nand X056) will necessitate land acquisition and resettlement. Four full resettlement plans were \nprepared in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) procedures. The other six local \nroads only require road resurfacing or traffic safety measures, so have no land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts. The three bus stations will not have involuntary resettlement impacts. The \nresettlement  plans  are  based  on  the  feasibility  studies;  when  the  detailed  design  of  each \nsubproject is finalized, the resettlement plans will be updated, disclosed to affected persons, \nand submitted to ADB for approval prior to commencement of civil works. \n \n2.  To avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, consultations with local officials, \nvillage committees, and affected persons were carried out for preparation of the resettlement \nplan. The Project will affect 129 villages of 37 townships and/or streets in 9 counties and/or \ndistricts. The Project will permanently acquire 952 hectares (ha) of land, of which 877 ha (92%) \nare classified as cultivated land. This will partially affect an estimated 16,925 households, which \nassumes the average loss is only 15%. Another 420 ha of land will be occupied temporarily for \nborrow pits, spoil areas, and construction camps; the specific sites will be selected during \nimplementation in accordance with land use and environmental regulations. Also, an estimated \n108,100 square meters of residential and nonresidential structures will need to be removed, \nrequiring the relocation of 921 households and affecting four enterprises with 45 staff. \n \n3.  For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome and living standards in accordance with the People\u2019s Republic of China laws and \nregulations, as well as ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). All persons affected by \nthe Project will be eligible for compensation and assistance. A cut-off date for eligibility for \ncompensation and assistance is the date of project feasibility study approval; notification will be \ngiven to all affected persons immediately thereafter. For land acquisition, compensation fees \ninclude a land compensation fee and a resettlement subsidy. The land compensation will be \npaid to the affected village or affected persons, while the resettlement subsidy will be paid to the \naffected persons. The land acquisition compensation is based on the comprehensive average \nannual output value of the land, time a multiple of 16 times. For house demolition, compensation \nwill be paid to owners based on replacement cost without depreciation, plus relocation and \ntransition  expenses.  Compensation  for  young  crops,  trees,  other  facilities,  and  temporary \nimpacts  will  be  paid  directly  to  affected  persons.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced \nproduction, sales, and wages caused by the Project will be assessed and compensated. \n \n4.  Livelihood rehabilitation strategies and initial village plans for restoration and relocation \nare included in each resettlement plan. The main income restoration strategies and measures \ninclude cash crop planting, livestock raising, and seeking work outside the province. Assistance \nmeasures include employment in project construction, provision of skills training, advice for \nstarting small businesses, and employment information for all affected persons. Regarding \nhouse relocation, the affected households can rebuild their houses by themselves or can select \nexchange housing. All displaced households will be allocated a free house plot with basic \nservices  (water,  electricity,  television  cable,  telephone,  and  road  access).  For  the \nfour enterprises, the owners will be compensated with cash at replacement cost for the lost \nstructure; they can be moved back and rebuilt along upgraded roads. \n \n5.  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  vulnerable  groups  for  their  relocation  and/or \nrehabilitation.  Vulnerable  groups  include  the  Wubao,  disabled,  elderly,  single-parent \nhouseholds, poverty households, and households seriously affected by land acquisition and \nresettlement. Within these groups, special attention and support is also for women, who may \nface unique impacts or may need assistance that is more appropriate to their special needs. \nVulnerable groups will receive additional assistance from the Project: (i) setting up special \n ", "64  Appendix 14 \nsupporting funds in each component, and (ii) providing skill training and arranging employment \nfor affected vulnerable persons. \n \n6.  The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement of the expressway and three \nupgraded local roads is CNY606.923 million including contingencies and land taxes, which is \nabout 7% of the total project cost. The land acquisition and resettlement costs are included as \npart  of  project  budget  and  will  be  funded  by  Anhui  Provincial  People's  Government.  The \npayment and usage of compensation funds will be carried out under the supervision of the \ninternal  audit  agencies,  with  regular  audit  review.  Detailed  measurement  surveys  will  be \nconducted and the compensation contracts negotiated and signed with village committees, \nhouseholds, and enterprises. \n \n7.  The resettlement social survey and initial consultation process were conducted. The \npeople  affected  have  been  informed  about  the  key  elements  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement through consultation during the planning stage and information disclosure sessions \nwith the affected people, villages, and county governments during the project preparation stage; \ntheir concerns are integrated in the resettlement plans. The draft resettlement plans will be \ndistributed to the affected counties and townships, and resettlement information booklets will be \nprovided to affected villages and affected persons in June 2009. Local governments will set up \nresettlement offices to supervise implementation, continue the public consultations, monitor \nprogress, and deal with grievances. \n \n8.  Anhui  Provincial  People's  Government  will  entrust  Anhui  Provincial  Department  of \nTransport  (APDOT)  to  assume  overall  responsibility  for  resettlement  management  and \nsupervision. A social, environment, and resettlement office within APDOT will coordinate the \nplanning, implementation, financing, and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement. The \nimplementing agency for the XME is the Anhui Communications Investment Group Company \nLimited (ACIG) and the implementing agency for the nine local roads is the Anhui Highway \nAdministration Bureau (AHAB). The local headquarter offices set up under ACIG and AHAB will \ntake primary responsibility for resettlement supervision, consultation, implementation, and timely \ndelivery of entitlements. A training program will be organized for ACIG, AHAB, and relevant \nlocal government resettlement officers. \n \n9.  In June 2009, the Anhui Provincial Land and Resources Department approved pre-\nexamination of land use for the XME. The formal procedures for land acquisition are expected to \nbe  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  by  June  2010.  Land  acquisition \ncompensation procedures and payments will be completed 1 month prior to the start of civil \nworks, which are scheduled for March 2010. House demolition will start in March 2010 and be \ncompleted by the end of 2010. To ensure a short transition for new house construction and \nresettlement site selection, government approvals and preparation of village infrastructure will \ncommence in August 2009 so that house construction can be completed in 2010. Training and \nincome restoration measures will be carried out from April 2010 to July 2011. Temporary land \noccupation will commence in March 2010; all lands should be restored before the completion of \neach subproject, which is scheduled in 2013. \n \n10.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted in \naccordance with methodologies specified in the resettlement plans. The terms of reference for \nexternal monitoring and evaluation is attached to the resettlement plans. Internal supervision \nand monitoring will be done by ACIG and AHAB to ensure compliance with the provisions of the \nplans. Resettlement progress and any key issues will be included in the quarterly progress \nreports submitted to ADB. ACIG and AHAB will engage an independent agency for semiannual \nmonitoring  and  annual  evaluation  of  project  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activity  until  \n2 years after the completion of land acquisition and resettlement. External monitoring reports \nwill be submitted to APDOT and ADB for comments and follow-up actions. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091119110240+08'00'", "Author": "lpc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 9.0.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091222123624+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Anhui RRP_Main_Final_Clean.doc"}}
