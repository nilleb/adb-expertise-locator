INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has asked the Asian Development Bank \nfor technical assistance (TA) in regulating and sustaining road transport in the country. ADB \nconducted a fact-finding mission during 23\u201326 April 2012 to discuss and formulate a policy and \nadvisory TA to address this need and reached agreement with the government on the scope, \nimpact  and  outcome,  outputs  and  activities,  cost  estimate,  financing,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for TA consultants. The TA is in accordance with the \ncountry partnership strategy (2011\u20132015)1 for PNG and is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for 2012\u20132014.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB  support  for  the  PNG  road  sector  commenced  in  1972,  well  before  other \ndevelopment partners started similar assistance.4 It has provided eight loans totaling about \n$400 million for seven investment projects in the sector so far and has also financed over $8 \nmillion of TA for 16 initiatives to reform policies, strengthen institutions, and develop capacity. \nADB is a lead development partner in the transport sector. Transport infrastructure development \nis a key focus of the current country partnership strategy.    \n \n3.  In 2008, ADB provided TA5 to help the Department of Transport (DOT) prepare a 20- to \n30-year national transport strategy (NTS). Sector analysis during NTS preparation has shown \nthat road transport in PNG suffers from inefficient and fragmented regulation. The DOT\u2019s Land \nTransport Division (LTD) is responsible for administering the regulations that govern vehicles, \ndrivers, and road transport but cannot provide the desired level of enforcement. The obstacles \nto better regulation are (i) a lack of coordinated strategic planning; (ii) unplanned delegation of \nresponsibility  to  provinces  that  lack  administrative  and  technical  capacity;  (iii)  overlapping \nfunctions  and  responsibilities  between  institutions;  (iv)  an  unclear  role  for  government  in \nregulating public transport; (v) poor road safety; and (vi) weak enforcement of vehicle licensing \nand inspection standards, drivers licensing, and route permits. To address these issues, the \nNTS  will  recommend  (i)  reforms  in  legislation,  statutory  instruments,  administration,  and \nenforcement; (ii) the establishment of a road traffic authority (RTA) by combining the LTD and \nthe  National  Road  Safety  Council;6 and  (iii)  sustainable  financing  for  the  RTA.  The  DOT \nsupports these recommendations and is keen to implement them.  \n \n4.  The RTA will regulate vehicles and drivers  but the responsibility for managing and \nmaintaining the country\u2019s national roads lies with the National Roads Authority (NRA) that was \nestablished in 2003 under the NRA Act. ADB supported the establishment and strengthening of \nNRA through TA approved in 2001 for Preparing the Road Authority Development Project.7 The \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 April 2012. \n4  By comparison, the Government of Japan\u2014through Japan Bank for International Cooperation and now Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency\u2014initiated road sector assistance in 1985 and was followed by Australian Agency \nfor International Development in 1995, European Union in 1997, and the World Bank in 2002.  \n5  Attached to ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed \nMultitranche Financing Facility to Papua New Guinea for the Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment \nProgram. Manila (Loans 2496 and 2497). The National Transport Strategy is in final stages of preparation. \n6  Established in 1997, the National Road Safety Council and its activities are constrained by limited financial \nresources. It now focuses only on developing a traffic accident database and raising road safety awareness.  \n7  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Road Authority Development Project. \nManila (TA 3716).  \n ", "2   \nNRA Act created a road fund managed by an autonomous board that was established in 2004. \nA  chief  executive  was  appointed  in  2007  but  the  NRA  was  not  sufficiently  staffed  and \noperationalized until 2009. The authority is maintaining about 2,000 kilometers of national roads \nthat were transferred from the Department of Works (DOW).8 Under ongoing project,9 ADB is \nproviding expertise to strengthen the NRA\u2019s capacity. The NRA legislation allows for a variety of \nroad user charges (RUCs) to finance the road fund but only a small fuel tax has been approved \nso far for this purpose. The NRA\u2019s ability to maintain roads is therefore limited. ADB is helping \nthe NRA enhance the fund\u2019s resources through its ongoing TA.10 This TA\u2019s recommendations \ninclude (i) increasing the existing levy on diesel, (ii) adding a levy on petrol, (iii) applying annual \nvehicle charges to be earmarked for the NRA, and (iv) working with resource companies to use \nthe government\u2019s tax credit scheme for maintenance of NRA roads. The NRA needs to convince \nthe  government  to  implement  these  recommendations  and  undertake  the  institutional  and \nprocedural reforms needed to increase the road fund\u2019s resources.  \n \n5.  The NRA also needs to improve its capacity to take over maintenance of more roads \nfrom the DOW and manage the targeted increase in road fund revenues. Its ability to award \nmaintenance contracts on time and keep to annual maintenance schedules is constrained by a \nlack of streamlined operational procedures and weak financial management. It needs support to \nimprove productivity. \n \n6.  The country\u2019s subnational road network  of provincial and district roads totals about \n20,000  kilometers  and  serves  85%  of  the  rural  population.  Because  government  road \nimprovement efforts have focused on national roads, rural roads have deteriorated through \nneglect. The provincial and local governments responsible for these assets do not have financial \nmeans or technical capacity to manage them and the few government initiatives to improve rural \ninfrastructure have so far been poorly managed and mostly ineffective. Preparation of the NTS \nhas  highlighted  these  issues,  as  well  as  the fact  that  without comprehensive  data  on  the \ncountry\u2019s subnational road network, the ability of national agencies to help provinces evaluate \nrural accessibility issues and plan and prioritize rural road improvements will remain limited.11 It \nis  important  that  a  comprehensive  and  reliable  database  on  rural  roads  be  compiled  and \neffectively managed and that the information that is currently held by the provinces and districts \nbe made easily available. Clear institutional responsibility for this work must also be assigned.  \n \n7.  Limited capacity in both the responsible government agencies and the private sector has \nslowed PNG\u2019s infrastructure development. One factor is a national shortage of skilled workers. \nThe government, for example, spends about $400 million annually to employ workers from \nabroad. PNG\u2019s Development Strategic Plan (DSP) for 2010\u2013203012 cites the importance of \nhigher education and a trained workforce to the country\u2019s development. The Medium Term \nDevelopment Plan (MTDP, 2011\u20132015) recognizes  that the current quantity and quality of \ngraduates in technical fields fall far short of PNG\u2019s needs. The DSP estimates that the country\u2019s \nskilled workforce of about 70,000 in 2011 should increase to about 300,000 by 2030 to meet its \ndevelopment targets and proposes to increase the number of graduates with necessary skills \n                                                \n8 The 8,500-kilometer national road network was once all under the management of the DOW. Since 2009, this \nresponsibility has been gradually shifting to the NRA as it develops capacity and collects financial resources \nthrough the road fund for road maintenance.   \n9  ADB. 2008.

Trained  engineers,  technicians,  and  skilled  field \npersonnel  are  particularly  needed  to  strengthen  the  capabilities  of  the  government  road \nagencies, the national consultancy sector, and contractors. Addressing these shortages and \nmeeting the DSP and MTDP targets will require the creation of a human resources strategy for \ntransport infrastructure development.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is a continuation of ADB\u2019s support for policy and institutional reforms to improve \nsustainability of investments in PNG\u2019s road sector. The impact of the TA will be more efficient \nand safer movement of goods and people on the country\u2019s roads. This will be reflected in \nreduced travel time and better conditions on national roads.  \n \n9.  The outcome will be better regulation of road transport that will result in a reduction in \nthe number of unregistered vehicles, unlicensed transport services, un-roadworthy vehicles, and \nroad  accidents.  Moreover,  an  increase  in  the  NRA\u2019s  annual  revenues  will  improve  the \nsustainability of road infrastructure.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will support government\u2019s initiatives in four areas: \n \n11.  Output 1: Establishing the Road Traffic Authority. The TA will help the DOT establish \nthe RTA by combining the functions of the LTD and the National Road Safety Council and \nensuring  that  the  RTA  is  financially  sustainable.  The  DOT  is  updating  the  country\u2019s  land \ntransport regulations13 and preparing legislation to establish the RTA.14 Once established, the \nRTA can review and update technical aspects of regulations governing, among others, fees, \nfines, and vehicle weight limits and implement any needed rules and procedures. Establishment \nof a successful RTA will involve preparatory work prior to legislation enactment, followed by the \nimplementation of new policies, rules, procedures, and systems after formal creation. The TA \nwill provide the initial guidance and support needed for the RTA to be launched and become \noperationally  effective.  The  TA  will  help  the  DOT  (i)  formulate  a  committee  that  will  be \nresponsible for establishing the RTA, and (ii) advise and guide the committee.   \n \n12.  Output 2: Increasing National Roads Authority capacity. The TA will help the NRA \nimplement  RUCs  developed  earlier  (footnote  10)  and  finalize  a  timeline  and  agency \narrangements for collection of revenues. It will also improve the NRA\u2019s capacity for planning, \nprogramming, financial management, and implementation. Recommendations prepared under \nthe TA (footnote 10) for increasing revenues for the NRA\u2019s road fund are being considered by \nthe government (paragraph 4). The proposed additional revenue will come from (i) an enhanced \nlevy on fuel, (ii) NRA annual charges, and (iii) use of the government\u2019s infrastructure tax credit \nscheme. Detailed action plans have been prepared to implement these charges. The DOT legal \nadvisor will assist in any legislative reforms needed (footnote 15). The TA will help the NRA \nimplement the charges. The TA will also help the NRA improve its capacity for (i) planning and \n                                                \n13 This  includes  the Motor  Traffic  Act  and  Regulations,  the Heavy  Vehicle  Licensing  Act,  the Land  Transport  \nBoard  Act, the Motor Vehicles Dealers Act, and the National Road Safety Council Act.  \n14 Under the Australian Agency for International Development financed Transport Sector Support Program, a legal \nadvisor is assisting DOT in this effort.  \n ", "4   \nmanaging road maintenance works, (ii) collecting RUCs, (iii) administering staff, (iv) financial \nmanagement, (v) improving governance, and (vi) measuring performance.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Developing a database on rural roads. The TA help the DOW develop a \nreliable, comprehensive geographic information system-linked database to identify existing rural \nroads and estimate the population served, design characteristics, and road conditions to help \nimprove  network  planning  and  prioritize  improvements.  The  TA  will  also  recommend \napproaches to managing and updating the database. The TA will help prepare an action plan to \ndevelop a geographic information system-linked database of provincial and district roads that \ncan be managed through a system similar to the DOW\u2019s road asset management system for \nnational roads. Data now available from the provinces, districts, and other sources will be used \nand supplemented by field surveys. The proposed database will cover the entire rural roads \nnetwork  and  be  linked  to  existing  information  on  the  national  roads  and  other  transport \ninfrastructure. It will also reflect connectivity to social and economic facilities as schools, clinics, \nand markets. The information on road characteristics and conditions to be included in the \ndatabase will be used for planning and prioritizing rural road improvements and estimating \nfunding needs. \n \n14.  Output 4: Expanding the skilled workforce. The TA will help the Office of Higher \nEducation (OHE) review human resource requirements to meet the DSP and MTDP transport \ninfrastructure  improvement  targets  and  recommend  measures  to  increase  the  skilled \nworkforce.15 The TA will work with the OHE to review the human resource requirements for \nmeeting the DSP and MTDP targets for transport infrastructure development. It will prepare \nrecommendations for increasing the size and quality of the workforce of engineers, technicians, \nand field personnel. The TA will (i) review government plans for increasing the skilled workforce \nas outlined in PNG Vision 2050,16 the DSP, and the MTDP and to meet the needs in transport \ninfrastructure; (ii) undertake a skilled labor market assessment through a survey of the private \nsector and industry (such as contractors, consultants, and operators) to estimate the current \nsupply of, and demand for, new engineers, technicians, and field personnel, as well as the need \nfor upgrading skills; (iii) prepare recommendations on how the current, medium-term, and long-\nterm needs for skilled labor can be met; (iv) review existing scholarship schemes; (v) review the \ncapacity of the national technical universities and colleges and explore the scope for expanding \nthem; (vi) identify the role of regional institutions; and (vii) prepare cost estimates and plans to \nimplement the recommendations. The TA output will also help the OHE prepare a national \nhigher education plan. \n       \n15.  The TA will support ongoing and planned initiatives by key development partners in the \ntransport  sector.  In  particular,  it  will  complement  phase  2  of  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  Transport  Sector  Support  Program,  which  covers  road  asset \nmaintenance through the NRA, road safety, and improving the performance of road agencies. \nMajor assumptions and risks are identified in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by  \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide counterpart \n                                                \n15 The initiative is not only included in the DSP and MTDP but was also recommended by IED\u2019s Sector Assistance \nProgram Evaluation on Transport Sector in the Pacific Developing Member Countries (1995\u20132010) and endorsed \nby the Development Effectiveness Committee.  \n16 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2009.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will have four implementing agencies: (i) the DOT, for establishing the RTA; (ii) \nthe NRA, for increasing NRA capacity; (iii) the DOW, for developing the rural roads database; \nand (iv) the OHE, for expanding the skilled workforce. The NRA will be the overall executing \nagency. The implementing agencies will support the TA consultants by providing furnished \noffice space, all relevant reports and materials, and counterpart staff. \n \n18.  The  TA  will  require  an  estimated  27  person-months  of  input  from  international \nconsultants and 5 person-months input by national consultants. The terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. Due to the specialized and varied nature of the required expertise, individual \nconsultants will be engaged to implement the TA. Individual consultants will be selected by ADB \nin accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA is expected to begin by \n27 August 2012 and to be completed by 31 December 2013. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  be  monitored  by  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  transport  sector  coordination,  monitoring,  and  implementation  committee  will \nserve as the TA steering committee to guide and advise on implementation. The transport and \ninfrastructure sector committee of the independent Consultative Implementation and Monitoring \nCouncil will also review the TA outputs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.
