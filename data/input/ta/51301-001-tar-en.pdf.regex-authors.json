INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help (i) strengthen \nteacher  quality  and  leadership  capacities  for  school  education  in  the  Philippines  through \ninnovative  initiatives  for  teacher  professional  development  and  education  leadership;  and \n(ii) enable knowledge exchange with Bangladesh, Cambodia, and the Philippines on innovative \napproaches  for  improving  teacher  quality  and  effectiveness  through  partnerships  between \ngovernment and civil society organizations (CSOs). \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2019 results-based work plan of the Sustainable Development \nand Climate Change Department.1 It is aligned with (i) the country partnership strategy of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for the Philippines, which focuses on reforms to increase school \ncompletion rates;2 (ii) the Secondary Education Support Program in the Philippines, funded by \nADB;3 and (iii) the objectives of school education programs supported by ADB in Bangladesh and \nCambodia.4 It also aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and the operational priority on addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities, which includes education.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and the Philippines are reforming their \neducational systems to improve quality and increase student learning. The aim is to create a \ncompetitive workforce that can respond to the demands of fast-changing labor markets.6 The job \nmarkets of tomorrow require highly skilled workers. Capable and highly skilled teachers are crucial \nto creating a new generation of learners. However, in the Philippines, while enrollment has been \nincreasing, quality remains a significant issue. A 2016 World Bank study showed that teachers\u2019 \ncontent knowledge is weak, in-service teacher training (INSET) is inadequate, and student \nlearning  remains  poor. 7  School  needs  and  teacher  specialization  and  deployment  are \nmismatched, and professional development is inadequate to deliver the recently mandated K to \n12  Program  (K\u201312) 8curriculum.  Countries  such  as  Bangladesh  and  Cambodia  also  face \nproblems regarding the quality and skills of their teachers. Bangladesh faces challenges in the \nquality of learning and inadequate teacher capacity. Cambodia faces disparities in educational \nattainment and lack of qualified teachers, particularly in secondary schools. The ministries of \neducation  in  Bangladesh,  Cambodia,  and  the  Philippines  are  partnering  with  CSOs  in \nimplementing innovative approaches to teacher professional development to improve teaching \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 March 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Teach for All (TFA), a global CSO, has been implementing a unique approach to \nattract talented and qualified graduates to improve the quality and impact of teaching. It is part of \na global CSO network of 48 independent country organizations with a shared vision of expanding \neducational  opportunities.  With  a  common  approach  of  selecting  young  high-performing \ngraduates and placing them as teachers with intensive and contextual teacher training, the \ncountry organizations affiliated with TFA have contributed to augmenting high-quality teacher \nresources in poor and remote schools. In the Philippines, Teach for the Philippines (TFP) has \nbeen a partner of the Department of Education (DepEd) in addressing teacher shortage. TFP has \na rigorous selection process to recruit qualified and motivated college graduates to be teachers. \nCandidates  undergo  500  hours  of  intensive  training  in  pedagogy  before  being  placed  in \ngovernment schools in collaboration with DepEd to alleviate teacher constraints. This partnership \nhas increased high-quality teacher resources in Grades 1-6 in underprivileged elementary schools. \nUnique to the Philippines, TFP has nurtured teachers to transition to being \u201cambassadors9\u201d to \nsupport education policy reform. The TA will engage TFP through direct contracting to scale up \nits interventions in Philippine schools by collaborating closely with DepEd. \n \n4.  It will build on TFP\u2019s work and achievements since its evolution from a predecessor CSO \n(Sa Aklat Sisikat Foundation) to TFP in 2012. It will also build on previous TA supported by ADB \nwith TFP, which adapted the TFA model to the Philippines. 10 The activities proposed in this TA \nrepresent a natural continuation and expansion of interventions undertaken through partnership \nbetween ADB, TFP, and DepEd to address teacher shortages and lack of adequate teacher \ncapacities for interactive classroom practices. An impact evaluation by the Abdul Latif Jameel \nPoverty Action Lab, a global research center working to reduce poverty by ensuring that policy is \ninformed by scientific evidence, confirmed the positive effect of the previous TA. Lessons learned, \namong others, include (i) the recognition that capacitating public school teachers in software and \ninformation and communication technology tools may require a back-to-basics approach and in-\ndepth training;  (ii)  considering  a  series  of  one-on-one meetings for  the  design  of steering \ncommittees instead of a single group format; and (iii) the value of developing an implementation \narrangement that works directly with TFP in managing consultants, which promoted ownership \nand prompt reporting of activities under the TA. The previous TA\u2019s completion report recommends \nexpanding TFP training to public school teachers for scale and sustainability. 11 The new TA will \nhelp to extend teacher training resources to more government teachers and to develop new \nteacher training modules for higher grades (7\u201310). \n   \n5.  In addition to ensuring cognitive skills, students need to develop soft or employability skills. \nSoft skills are part of the 21st century skills the Philippines has incorporated into the K\u201312 \ncurriculum. The TA will assess and document unique and country-specific efforts of the TFA \nnetwork in the three countries covered by the TA to enhance teacher competencies in preparing \nstudents for jobs of the future.  \n \n6.  Similar to TFP, Teach for Bangladesh and Teach for Cambodia complement efforts of the \nrespective governments in teacher training. The TA will support the development of a knowledge \nproduct  that  documents  country-specific  approaches  in  Bangladesh,  Cambodia,  and  the \nPhilippines;  and  emerging  lessons  and  promising  approaches that  could  be  used  in  other \n                                                \n 9  Ambassadors are TFP teachers who opt to spend another year working in the Philippine government, at various \n    agencies to do policy-related roles (Source: TFP). \n10 ADB. 2010.

The TA will help to remedy the lack of adequate teacher capacities in poor government \nschools by creating new pedagogical models. It will support the expansion of TFP good practices \nand help to capture tacit knowledge by documenting the experience of Teach for Bangladesh and \nTeach for Cambodia in teacher professional development to improve teaching and learning. \nBangladesh and Cambodia exemplify the challenges faced by developing countries in improving \nthe quality and performance of the teaching force. The TA will complement ongoing  ADB \noperations in support of nationwide reforms to school education in these countries and help \nstrengthen government\u2013CSO partnerships to improve quality. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: quality of teaching and learning in intervention \nschools improved.12 The TA will have the following outcome: instructional practice and leadership \nskills in intervention schools improved.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Teacher professional development for primary and junior secondary \neducation in  government  schools  enhanced. This  will  support  the development  of  new \ncurricula and training material for in-service professional development of teachers, covering \n100 TFP teachers and 1,000 government teachers, through DepEd\u2019s INSET in the Philippines. \nTraining materials developed under this TA will be available in an open domain. This will benefit \n15,000 students in primary and secondary needy public schools in the Philippines.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Leadership skills for basic education strengthened. This will help to develop \na customized training program for public officials and TFP teachers seeking to transition from \nteaching to public service roles in the Philippines. This leadership training program will also \nfacilitate education sector reforms. The TA will finance the development of curricula, training \nmaterial, and training of trainers, designed in partnership with a leading management institution. \nA certificate program on leadership and change management will be developed, and this training \nwill benefit 30 public officials and 30 TFP ambassadors to facilitate leadership for implementing \nK\u201312 reforms in the Philippines, particularly to improve quality. \n \n11.  Output 3: Knowledge sharing and dissemination facilitated. The output will support \nsharing of key lessons and successful approaches in a two-pronged way in ADB\u2019s developing \nmember countries. First, it will support knowledge sharing through DepEd\u2019s INSET training and \nlearning circles, reaching a larger group of government teachers. Second, a regional workshop \nwill present a knowledge product from Bangladesh, Cambodia, and the Philippines to enable \npooling of knowledge on teacher professional development and teacher effectiveness. Innovative \napproaches to teacher professional development through CSOs in these three countries will be \n                                                \n12 This impact statement is adapted from ADB. 2016.

These are examples of countries in the region with significant ADB interventions in the education   \nsector. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \ndocumented and disseminated, using possible multimedia tools. The TA will facilitate focus group \nand online discussions, and multimedia tools on sharing best practices. Online resources will be \ndeveloped for knowledge sharing with stakeholders in ADB\u2019s three developing member countries \non how to improve the capacity of teachers and government officials. These will be documented \nin the planned knowledge product and online knowledge resources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6: $165,000 and TASF-other sources: $585,000). The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing and implementing agencies. TFP will \nbe engaged as a consultant through direct contracting in accordance with the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) to deliver the outputs. A steering committee, with \nrepresentation from TFP and DepEd, will meet annually to review implementation progress. The \nTA will be monitored by ADB\u2019s Education Sector Group Secretariat in coordination with the \nrespective regional departments. Regular TA review missions will be fielded to monitor progress. \n \n14.  A direct contract is envisaged with TFP since it is in a unique position to undertake this TA \nas the continuation of a partnership between TFP\u2013ADB and TFP\u2013DepEd in the following ways: \n(i) placing TFP teachers in needy government schools facing teacher shortages; (ii) expanding \nteacher training beyond the primary grades to junior secondary grades at the request of DepEd; \nand (iii) extending the methodology for teacher professional development to more than 1,000 \ngovernment teachers and to DepEd\u2019s INSET for wider application of successful practices. As a \ntrusted  CSO,  TFP  will  collaborate  with  DepEd  to  advance  initiatives  to  improve  teacher \nprofessional development and in-school support to enhance the learning environment. TFP will \nalso enable the sharing of country-specific experiences in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and the \nPhilippines. All three countries have TFA initiatives, which is a unique worldwide effort based on \na common model for improving teacher resources in poor public schools. No other global CSO \nnetwork comparable with TFA is working on issues of teacher professional development and \npractice. The TA will enable ADB to apply innovative CSO-led approaches to improve classroom \nteaching and learning to large-scale education sector programs financed through ADB loans. \n \n15.  TFP will carry out procurement in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy and its \nassociated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. TFP will be engaged for \nthe TA using direct contracting. This is in line with the provisions for a direct contract, as the \nconsulting services of TFP represent a natural continuation of work carried out in the previous TA \n(para. 14). TFP will oversee day-to-day implementation, including procurement, disbursement, \nreporting, and information collection. TFP will procure goods through request for quotations. \nLimited office equipment, data management tools, and software licenses may be purchased. All \nequipment will be procured by TFP and will be turned over to DepEd at the end of the TA. \n \n16.
