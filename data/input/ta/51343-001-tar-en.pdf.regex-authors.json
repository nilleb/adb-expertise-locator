INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Indonesia has requested knowledge and support technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on the implications of disruptive technologies on \nIndonesia. The TA will study the impact of disruptive technology, and how Indonesia can position \nitself to maximize the benefits and minimize the potential risks. It will address a critical knowledge \ngap and inform the government\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN, 2020\u2013\n2024).  \n \n2.  The TA supports the government\u2019s policy priorities under the National Medium Term \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJMN,  2015\u20132019).1 While  the  TA  is  not  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations  business  plan  for  Indonesia,  2018\u20132020,  it  is  fully  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019 and Midterm Review of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.2 The \nTA is consistent with the country knowledge plan and ADB\u2019s priorities on supporting new \nknowledge and high-level technologies to maximize development impact.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Transformative impact of disruptive technologies.4 The digital economy is disrupting \nand transforming production, consumption, governance, and societal interactions. It is driven by \ntwo interlinked technological forces: increasing internet connectivity and advancement in machine \nlearning. The combination of these technologies is enabling humans to decipher with speed the \npatterns of large structured and unstructured data generated by the connectivity. Disruptive \ntechnologies (internet of things, robots, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, blockchain) will influence \nhow (as well as where) goods are produced and services delivered, and people\u2019s lifestyle choices, \nincluding the future of work. For example, mobile phones and the internet took only a few years \nto spread, but the technology has disrupted and transformed a wide range of economic activities. \nThe speed  of  \u201ccreative  destruction\u201d  heralded by  disruptive  technologies  is  expected  to  be \nexponential. The current suite of disruptive technologies is referred to as \u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d because \nof the scope, scale, and speed of the impact.5 \n  \n4.  Potential for digital transformation. 6 Indonesia is among the fastest-growing internet \nmarkets in the world, and Southeast Asia is the fastest-growing region. From 2014 to 2015, mobile \ninternet usage in Indonesia increased from 55 million to 67 million; revenues from cloud services \nincreased from $269 million to $364 million; the total number of connected devices (internet of \nthings) increased from 32 million to 39 million; and internet traffic (big data and advanced analytics) \nincreased from 277 petabytes to 448 petabytes. Among the active internet user population, 78% \n                                                \n1  Government of Indonesia. 2015. National Medium-Term Development Plan: RPJMN, 2015\u20132019.

Based \non this trend, the e-commerce market in Indonesia is projected to increase from about $2 billion \nin 2017 to $46 billion in 2025. \n \n5.  Benefits and risks.7 The potential benefits of digitization for Indonesia\u2019s economy is \nprojected to be about $150 billion by 2025, and the multiplier effect will likely be substantially \nlarger. The benefits of disruptive technology accrue from the increased participation of the \nnonproductive and partially active workforce as well as improvements in labor productivity. For \ninstance, online ride hailing applications in Indonesia, such as Grab and Go-Jek, have not only \nincreased jobs, but service providers have better wages and access to insurance. Likewise, the \nrapid growth of FinTech players has the potential to provide borrowers, especially the unbanked \npopulation, with alternative means to access financial services. Further, disruptive technologies \ncould  lead  to  improved  efficiency  in  the  economic  sectors  (e.g.,  manufacturing,  transport, \nagriculture, and public utilities). A surge in foreign investments in e-commerce platforms in \nIndonesia signals the potential of the digital economy for the country. \n \n6.  Disruptive technologies also pose important risks for Indonesia in the form of jobs losses \nin certain sectors and a potential increase in inequality. For instance, about 60% of salaried \nworkers in the manufacturing sector in Indonesia are potentially at risk from automation. In the \nabsence of effective policies, the economics of the internet tend to favor natural monopolies and \nlead to the concentration of markets and polarization of benefits. Analog complements (institutions, \nskills, and regulations) will be important in ensuring the impact of such technologies is more \ninclusive. \n \n7.  Constraints. 8 In 2012, Indonesia scored 3.11 (0 = lowest, 10 = highest) in the population \nweighted Knowledge Economy Index,9 down from 3.68 in 1995. Indonesia\u2019s global ranking on the \nknowledge economy has slipped from 88th position (out of 100; 1 = the best) in 1995 to 97th in \n2012. Indonesia lags on information and communication technology infrastructure compared with \nits peers, digital usage is uneven across regions, and internet penetration remains low. This is \nlargely due to low public and private investment in technology infrastructure, skills mismatch, and \nlack of an appropriate policy and regulatory framework. \n \n8.  Government initiatives to leverage benefits. The government has developed the 2020 \nGo  Digital  Vision,  which  entails  Indonesia  emerging  as  the  largest  digital  economy  in  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by 2020. The government\u2019s 14th economic \nreform package included a road map for promoting e-commerce.10 The road map included actions \naround funding, taxation, cybersecurity, consumer protection, education and human resources, \ncommunication infrastructure, and logistics. The government has started targeted measures to \n                                                \n7  McKinsey&Company. 2016. Indonesia in the digital age \u2013 an anthology of digital perspective.

Knowledge gap. A critical knowledge gap exists regarding the impact of disruptive \ntechnologies on Indonesia. This limits the development of enabling policies as well as a clear \nbusiness case for public investments. The following issues remain understudied: (i) the aggregate \nimpact on the economy; (ii) implications on productivity, efficiency, and employment at the sector \nlevel; (iii) an effective policy framework designed to help materialize the benefits and reduce the \nrisks for Indonesia; and (iv) the implications for development partners, including ADB. The TA will \nhelp address this knowledge gap. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s value addition. With Indonesia aiming toward higher income levels in the context \nof a complex global and regional economic environment, ADB\u2019s operations in Indonesia have an \nincreasingly strong focus on knowledge solutions, and seek to leverage knowledge and financing \nin the core sectors. In addition to the expected impact on the national economy and the job market, \nthe digital transformation will have direct implications on ADB\u2019s core sectors of operations in \nIndonesia. The TA will be part of a series of knowledge products that ADB will contribute in \ninforming the country\u2019s medium-term development plan. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  benefits  of  technology  leveraged  for \nsustainable and inclusive economic growth (TA defined). The study findings will inform the \nNational Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN, 2020\u20132024). The TA will have the following \noutcome: better informed public policies and investment plans.12 \n \nB.  Output, Methods, and Activities \n12.  Output: Flagship study on the implications of disruptive technologies for Indonesia \nprepared. The TA will support analysis of the implications of disruptive technologies on Indonesia. \nThe study will cover both economy-wide impacts, as well as the impacts on selected sectors and \nsubsectors (such as manufacturing, finance, energy, e-commerce, and urban). The analysis will \nseek to model the effects on the Indonesian economy, which are likely to be transmitted and \namplified through global value chains; and examine the broader implications for industrialization, \nemployment prospects, and inequality. \n \n13.  Analytical approach. The analysis will seek to answer the following questions: (i) What \nare the implications for economic productivity, jobs, and inequality? and (ii) What needs to be \ndone to leverage the benefits and mitigate the risks? Question (ii) will identify the policies and \ninvestment required for increasing Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness, capability, and connectedness. \nSocial concerns (e.g., impact on poverty and gender) will be integrated as crosscutting themes. \nThe current body of literature on the topic will be used to map technology and its relevance to the \n(sub)sector. The topics covered by the TA will include: disruptive technologies, macroeconomic \n                                                \n11 M. Basu. 2017.

Research methodology. The analysis will employ quantitative methods grounded in \nrelevant economic theory. As relevant, enterprise surveys will be conducted. Qualitative case \nstudies will be used to increase the granularity of the analysis. Sex disaggregated data, where \navailable, will be prioritized to inform the likely gender impacts. Data availability and limitations \nwill be taken into consideration when refining the methodology. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, secretarial assistance, domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Indonesia  Resident  Mission,  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment will select, administer, and supervise the consultants\u2019 outputs for the TA, and will \nevaluate  consultants.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and the Ministry of Finance will be the implementing \nagencies. The TA will be coordinated with relevant ministries, such as the Coordinating Ministry \nof Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Communications and Informatics. \nPursuing the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, the resident mission will closely coordinate the implementation \nof the TA with ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department as well as other \nrelevant departments and offices. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from January 2018 to March 2020. TA resources will be \ndisbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).
