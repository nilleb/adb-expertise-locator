I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Xinjiang  Altay  Urban  Infrastructure  and \nEnvironment Improvement Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will improve urban infrastructure facilities and the environment in five border \ncounties  (Buerjin,  Fuhai,  Habahe,  Jimunai,  and  Qinghe)  of  Altay  Prefecture  (Altay)  in  the \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), which will help upgrade urban living conditions \nand rehabilitate the environment. Improving urban infrastructure will contribute to long-term \npoverty reduction and improve the quality of life, particularly the health status of about 100,000 \nurban residents, in five project counties.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The development of XUAR is a top priority for the PRC. XUAR is one of the poorest and \nmost remote regions in the northwest with a large ethnic minority population of 46% Uygur and \n15% other minority ethnic groups.3 Around 97% of the population lives in an oasis belt covering \nonly 8% of the region's total land area. Water availability is a critical concern to the fragile \necology of XUAR, which is predominantly a desert territory characterized by strong winds, low \nrainfall, and a high evaporation rate. Recognizing the need for greater national support, the \nGovernment of the PRC inaugurated a counterpart or twinning scheme whereby assistance \nfrom other provinces and/or municipalities will be used to strengthen capacity in XUAR and \nimprove local living standards. In May 2010, the government outlined a number of policies and \nmeasures to aid XUAR\u2019s development. Nineteen nominated provinces and/or municipalities will \nprovide financial contributions from 2011 to 2020 to achieve noticeable impacts. Under this \nscheme,  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  provinces  in  the  northeast  PRC  will  jointly  support  project \ncounties in Altay. \n \n4.  Altay is the northernmost area in XUAR. It comprises one city (Altay City) and six \ncounties (Buerjin, Fuhai, Fuyun, Habahe, Jimunai, and Qinghe); and shares a border totaling \n1,175 kilometers (km) with Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation. Altay\u2019s total \npopulation of 658,000 comprises 51.4% Kazakh, 41.6% Han, and 7% other ethnic groups. While \n44% of the population is urban, about 16% of the urban population lives below the official \npoverty line, with Jimunai and Qinghe designated as national poverty counties. The XUAR and \nAltay Prefecture governments have accorded high priority to infrastructure improvement, which \nwill also benefit neighboring countries through the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC)4 program. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports the promotion of regional \ntrade through this program and is working with other development partners to advance cross-\nborder cooperation. Along with other areas in XUAR, Altay City and Kanas Scenic Zone in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China for Preparing the Xinjiang Altay Urban Infrastructure and Environment Improvement Project. Manila. \n3  All  data  refers  to  Government  of  the  PRC.  2009.  PRC  Statistical  Yearbook.  Beijing;  and  Xinjiang  Uygur \nAutonomous Region Government, 2009. XUAR Statistical Yearbook. Urumqi (in Chinese, unless otherwise stated).  \n4  ADB initiated the CAREC program in 1997. Its goal is to improve living standards and to reduce poverty in CAREC \ncountries through more efficient and effective regional economic cooperation. To date, the program has focused on \nfinancing infrastructure projects and improving the region's policy environment in priority areas of transport, energy, \nand trade policy and facilitation. ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Logistics \nDevelopment and Capacity Building in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Manila. ", "2 \nBuerjin are involved in two ongoing ADB-loan-funded urban projects in the region.5 \n \n5.  Altay suffers from a very harsh climate, with subzero temperatures between October and \nMarch,  and  annual  precipitation  of  about  180  millimeters  but  high  evaporation  of  about \n2,000 millimeters. It has scenic mountains, lakes, rivers, desert, and meadows, making tourism \none of its pillar industries. Currently, its top-ranked tourist destination is the Kanas Scenic Zone, \nfollowed  by  other  developing  tourist  destinations  such  as  the White  Birch  Scenic  Area  in \nHabahe, and Qinghe. Altay has four land ports with access to Kazakhstan and Mongolia. While \ntourism and cross-border trade have the potential to contribute to economic growth and job \ncreation, particularly for the ethnic population residing in these border towns, it also relies on \ngood accommodation, excellent delivery of municipal services, safe and available transport, and \na pristine environment. \n \n6.  Across Altay, infrastructure facilities are inadequate to meet existing demand and hinder \nthe expansion of local economies. Road surfaces are severely damaged by winter freezing and \ntraffic, and the road network is incomplete. Utilities are either nonexistent or are old, fragile, and \nmostly insufficient, resulting in frequent service failures and environmental pollution. Water \nsupply capacity is restricted by inadequate infrastructure and water quality is compromised by \nhigh  seasonal  turbidity.  Most  of  the  county  areas  lack  sewers,  and  wastewater  treatment \ncapacity is marginal. Refuse collection and disposal are poorly managed, and most landfills \nresemble unregulated dumping grounds. Decentralized heating plants have low-efficiency, coal-\nfired boilers while hot water distribution has limited coverage, thus creating serious pollution \nproblems in urban areas. All of these threaten human health, pollute the environment, and \nconstrain  necessary  improvements  in  living  standards.  Therefore,  comprehensive  urban \ninfrastructure improvements are needed urgently.6 \n \n7.  In view of the experiences and lessons obtained from the previous urban projects in the \nPRC,  the  project  design  features  multisector  integrated  approaches.  The  project  will  thus \nprovide essential road, water supply, wastewater and solid waste management, and centralized \nheating infrastructure to five county seat towns in Altay and the Takeshiken Land Port. The \nholistic  approach  to  better  infrastructure  will  (i)  improve  living  conditions  and  the  urban \nenvironment, (ii) support tourism to enhance inclusive growth, and (iii) help raise the efficiency \nat land ports. This will assist Altay\u2019s growing cross-border trade and tourism, create favorable \nconditions for trade-related investment and employment, and expedite the development of the \nprocessing and service industries, all critical for poverty alleviation. \n \n8.  Low-impact urban development with low carbon footprint. The project will support \nthe  government\u2019s  strategy  in  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan  to  build  environment-friendly  and \nresource-efficient  towns.  A  parallel  technical  assistance  initiated  by  ADB\u2014the  Resource-\nEfficient Towns Development in the Xinjiang Altay Area7\u2014has highlighted initiatives to limit \nimpacts of urban activity on the environment. This technical assistance developed a plan8 to \npromote reduction, reuse, and recycling (3Rs) approaches to municipal service delivery and the \napplication of renewable energy use, which have been incorporated in the project design and \nimplementation.  In  particular,  the  promotion  of  the  3Rs  will  recommend  service  delivery \nimprovements such as solid waste recycling, water demand management, wastewater effluents \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

", "3 \nand  sludge  reuse,  and  the  introduction  of  renewable  energy.  It  also  provides  for  a public \ninformation and training campaign to build awareness and ensure the effective application of the \n3Rs principle. Wastewater treatment schemes will also provide effluents and sludge suitable for \nirrigation and fertilization of windbreak forest in arid lands, thus avoiding the need to abstract \nraw river water or discharge polluting effluents to the rivers, which addresses water scarcity by \nsaving the raw water and also conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Policy.9 Well-managed potable water \nsupply, wastewater reuse, solid waste recycling, and reduced pollution through improvements in \nthe centralized heating system are vital in keeping the environment and economy sustainable.  \n \n9.  Enhanced  long-term  operational  efficiency  and  sustainability.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities in support of urban infrastructure development. Based \non the lessons learned on the importance of securing operation sustainability, the project will \nprovide an institutional capacity building program for implementing agencies and for future \noperation and maintenance (O&M) units. Owing to the small scale and remote location, an \nindividual component may not have either the skilled personnel or the capacity to engage them \nfull-time. Therefore, the  project  will  set  up  regional  technical  support groups for  municipal \nengineering management. Under the scheme, the project counties will develop and share their \ntechnical capacities. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be better living standards and conditions in the project counties. The \noutcome will be integrated and more efficient municipal services in the project counties of Altay. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will implement 26 components based on seven main outputs. These are \n(i) construction and/or upgrading of 59.1 km of roads of varying widths and capacities, including \nlighting,  signage,  and  traffic  controls;  (ii)  water  supply  including  better  quality  raw  water \nabstraction, four new water supply plants with a total capacity of 16,890 cubic meters per day, \nand laying of water pipes with a total length of 153.3 km; (iii) wastewater treatment and disposal \nconsisting of six new wastewater treatment plants with a total capacity of 31,200 cubic meters \nper day and 78 km of collector and trunk sewers; (iv) solid waste management comprising five \nnew sanitary landfills with a total capacity of 238 tons per day, 11 km of access roads, 10-\nkilovolt power line, transfer stations, multiple waste collection points, and provision of transport \nand auxiliary equipment, and environmental improvement of five existing landfills; (v) centralized \nheating supply including two new or upgraded central-heating, coal-fired boiler stations, 15 \nheating exchange stations, and heating pipes with a length of 17.8 km; (vi) construction of \ninfrastructure in White Birch Forest Scenic Area; and (vii) capacity building that will include \nintensive project management and implementation training for the Altay project management \noffice  (PMO)  and  county  PMOs,  and  additional  capacity  assistance  for  other  agencies \nconcerned. 10  A  detailed  description  of  the  outputs  and  components  is  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).11  \n \nD.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term including a grace period \nof 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, interest and other \ncharges during construction to be capitalized in the loan, and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan will cover civil works, equipment, \nproject management consulting services, and capacity building. The government will finance the \nremaining $68.52 million of project cost, including contingencies. The government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility \nbased on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The \nfinancing plan is in Table 2 and is further detailed in the PAM. \n \n14.  Relending arrangements. The borrower of the loan is the PRC. The loan proceeds will \nbe entirely made available to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government (XUARG), \nupon  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.  XUARG,  through  the  Altay  Prefecture \nGovernment (APG), will make the loan proceeds available to the project county governments in \nthe amounts indicated in the loan agreement. The relending terms and conditions of the loan \nproceeds will be the same as those of the ADB loan. Each county government will bear the \nforeign exchange and interest rate variation risks in proportion to the loan amount it receives. \nThe indicative flow of funds and relending arrangements are in the PAM. \n ", "5 \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  100.00  59.0 \nGovernment   68.52  41.0 \n  Total  168.52  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  A Xinjiang project leading group and Xinjiang PMO were formally established by XUARG \nin 2006 and have now been assigned the role of overseeing and managing the preparation and \nimplementation of the project. All project components are located within the jurisdiction of the \nAltay Prefecture and APG will be the project executing agency. The Altay project leading group, \nestablished in 2007, will be responsible for providing policy guidance for the project within the \nprefecture. APG, through the Altay PMO, will undertake detailed project coordination, and will \nengage  and  supervise  the  technical  engineering  design  institutes,  project  implementation \nconsultants, and external social and environmental monitors involved in the project. The Altay \nPMO will also manage the procurement process. Both the Xinjiang and Altay PMOs have \nprevious experience in implementing ADB-financed projects. Each project county's government \nwill be the implementing agency for the project components carried out in its jurisdiction. Each \nimplementing agency will designate its county urban construction bureau to be the project \nimplementation unit (PIU). The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2011\u2013December 2017 \nEstimated completion  31 December 2017 \ndate \nLoan closing date  30 June 2018 \nManagement     \n(i)  Oversight body  Xinjiang PLG and  Xinjiang PLG is chaired by XUARG vice governor and \n  Xinjiang PMO  includes: (i) XUARG deputy secretary-general; \n(ii) senior officials from XUAR Development and \nReform Commission, XUAR Finance Bureau, and \nXUAR Housing and Urban-Rural Development \nBureau; and (iii) APG vice governor.

The project includes funding for international and national consulting services to support \nthe executing agency and implementing agencies in addition to building capacity of the O&M \nunits.12 The terms of reference for consulting services are in the PAM. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n17.  The project will directly benefit about 100,000 people in Altay, of which about 16,000 or \n16% live below the official poverty line. It will improve infrastructure facilities and the urban \nenvironment in five border counties of Altay through building road network facilities; new water \nsupply, wastewater, and solid waste treatment facilities; central heating systems; and enhancing \nwater  resources  management,  solid  waste  recycling,  and  disposal  management.  Net \nenvironmental benefits will also be gained from the closure of polluting and inefficient landfills, \nwastewater treatment facilities, and heating centers. The reuse of wastewater in revegetating \ndesert fringe areas will also prevent land degradation. \n \nA.  Technical \n18.  All  project  components  are  designed  taking  into  account  local  circumstances, \ntopography, and climate (predominantly flat arid terrain but with long, harsh winters), and in \naccordance with relevant PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The processes selected \nfor water and wastewater treatment as presented in local feasibility study reports are relatively \neasy to operate and maintain, and appropriate for small towns where technical capacity is \nlimited. The component designs also incorporate the 3Rs approaches and renewable energy \nuse. Capacity building to ensure adequate skills for O&M will be financed under the loan. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  Economic analysis13 (cost\u2013benefit) was conducted for 15 of the 26 components and \nincluded  the  calculation  of  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  economic \nopportunity cost of capital was assumed to be 12%. The EIRR of all components analyzed \nranged from 14.5% to 18.7%, and was thus above the economic opportunity cost of capital.  For \nthe 11 components for which the EIRR was not calculated, a least-cost (cost-effectiveness) \n                                                \n12 To be provided through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n13  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nanalysis was applied. Financial analysis14 of components was undertaken to determine the \ncapacity of implementing agencies to recover project costs, including debt service obligations \nand O&M costs. The financial internal rate of return was calculated for revenue-generating \ncomponents. Financial internal rates of return for the sectors are: 4.8% for solid waste, 14.3% \nfor heating, 3.9% for wastewater, and 4.1% for water supply. These figures are all above the \naverage weighted cost of capital, which ranges from 2.3% to 2.7% for separate sectors. \n \n20.  Tariffs for water, wastewater, and solid waste will need to be increased when the ADB-\nfinanced facilities come into operation. Tariffs will be increased gradually until full cost recovery \nis achieved, taking into account affordability factors.15 Subsidies will be provided to cover O&M \nwhere  revenues  are  insufficient. The tariff subsidy  for the  poor  (minimum  living  standards \nguarantee recipients) will be maintained. The project will provide capacity building on tariff \nsetting and tariff reforms. The affordability of tariffs was calculated for all households and for the \nsubset of low-income (poor) households. Combined tariffs for water, wastewater, and solid \nwaste ranged from 0.5% to 1.9% of the income for average households across project counties, \nand between 0.6% and 2.3% for low-income households. For project counties with heating \nsubcomponents, combined tariffs for water, wastewater, solid waste, and heating ranged from \n1.2% to 3.6% of the income of average households and between 1.5% and 3.9% for low-income \nhouseholds.  This  is  within  the  acceptable  range  of  affordability,  as  measured  against  the \ninternational  benchmark  that  such  services  should  not  exceed  5%  of  household  income. \nRegarding the 10 nonrevenue-generating components, a sustainability analysis was undertaken \nof county governments\u2019 revenues and expenditures. They indicate that the project will not put \nundue strain on their ability to provide counterpart funds during implementation and meet debt \nservicing. Project counterpart requirements in the highest year (2012), when compared with \nrevenues in 2009, range from 2.5% to 5.0% of the governments\u2019 revenue base. A financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that the financial management capacity of implementing \nagencies is adequate for the implementation of the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith XUARG, APG, and the project county governments. The procurement capacity assessment \nconcluded that procurement capacity of the Altay PMO and the procedural arrangements in \nplace are adequate to enable full compliance with ADB procurement guidelines. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Living conditions in areas of the project county seats are poor, particularly during winter \nand spring, when garbage accumulates and well water becomes contaminated. The project will \nprovide households with access to safe and reliable water supply, and better roads, heating, \nand physical living environment. Public awareness programs and implementation of the 3Rs \nprinciple will ensure the positive and long-term social benefits of the project. Unemployment is \nthe main cause of poverty in the project counties, and job creation will have a significant impact \non  poverty  reduction.  Construction  activities  will  directly  create  1,465  temporary  jobs,  and \nindirectly 3,809 temporary jobs. The O&M will directly create an estimated 353 permanent jobs, \nand indirectly 565 jobs. Many temporary jobs will be unskilled, and contractors are required to \nemploy local workers when possible. The Altay PMO has set employment targets for women \nand ethnic minorities. County community offices and the Labor Bureau will assist the contractors \nin realizing these targets. Implementing agencies will ensure that all PRC labor laws and core \nlabor standards are respected. This will be closely monitored under the project performance \n                                                \n14  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nmonitoring system. Details on specific measures to ensure the poverty and social benefits are in \nthe gender action plan, social action plan in the PAM, and ethnic minority development plan.16 \n \n23.  At the macro level, current infrastructure in project county seats is inadequate to support \neconomic expansion. Despite the existence of an educated urban population and its specific \ngeographic and cultural conditions, Altay, due to infrastructure constraints, is yet to materialize \nits economic potential, particularly in the fields of tourism and cross-border trade. The project \nwill aid Altay\u2019s growing tourism and cross-border trade by providing an enabling condition to \nexpedite development of the related service industries, which are the engine for growth and \npoverty alleviation. \n \n24.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. More \neffective infrastructure will result in reduced time burdens, and greater mobility, access, and \npublic health. Women strongly support the project across all county seats, as it will improve their \nquality  of  life,  public  health,  and  create  jobs  and  income  opportunities.  Gender  has  been \nmainstreamed into the project design (features such as road lighting, nonmotorized transport, \nand pedestrian access are included); and a project gender action plan has been prepared that \nwill (i) ensure women\u2019s consultation and participation in project activities; (ii) provide gender-\nsensitivity training to the county PMO and implementing agency staff; (iii) ensure that project \ndecision-making bodies and participants in capacity building activities are gender-balanced; and \n(iv) include appropriate gender targets, indicators, and sex-disaggregated data.17 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  The  project  is classified  as  category  A  in  ADB\u2019s  environmental  categorization.  The \nproject environmental impact assessment (EIA) was posted on the ADB website on 9 November \n2010 and circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 12 November 2010. The EIA complies with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Extensive public consultation involving surveys, \nmeetings  with  stakeholders,  and  focus  group  discussions  was  undertaken  during  the \npreparation of the EIA. The EIA concludes that the project has substantial environmental and \nsocioeconomic benefits resulting from integrated improvements in urban transportation, water \nsupply, sewage collection and treatment, urban solid waste treatment and management, and \ndistrict heating facilities. The specific environmental concerns of the project during construction \ninclude soil erosion, dust generation, and closure and decommissioning of replaced facilities. \nDuring operation, concerns include secondary pollution from the wastewater treatment plant \nsludge, wastewater and landfill leachate, as well as cumulative impacts on downstream water \nusers. Such concerns have been fully dealt with in the environmental management plan and the \nenvironmental monitoring plan. Comprehensive river basin analyses and water balances have \nconfirmed that the impact on the region\u2019s sensitive surface water resources will be positive \nregarding  water  quality  and  acceptable  regarding  water  quantities.  The  reuse  of  treated \nwastewater to irrigate windbreak forests will help combat land degradation and desertification. \nSavings in carbon dioxide emissions will accrue from the rationalization of urban road transport \nand road connectivity, the replacement of aging heating facilities, and the carbon sequestration \nprovided by irrigated forest plantations. The Altay PMO will be responsible for setting up the \nenvironmental  management  system,  consisting  of  inspection,  monitoring,  reporting,  and \ninitiating corrective actions or measures. Environmental monitoring and reporting will continue \nduring operation, at the minimum on an annual basis. Each implementing agency will nominate \ndedicated,  trained,  and  qualified  environment  specialists  who  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the environmental management plan. A detailed training program for capacity \n                                                \n16  Gender Action Plan, Project Administration Manual, and Ethnic Minority Development Plan (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nbuilding and a project-wide grievance redress mechanism have been developed and included in \nthe project EIA.18  \n26.  The project is classified as category A for the involuntary resettlement safeguard. The \nproject will acquire about 51.47 hectares (ha) of collective land, of which 40.77 ha (79%) is \nclassified as grassland. It will also acquire 68.7 ha of state-owned land. A total of 16,144 square \nmeters  of  residential  houses  and  2,773  square  meters  of  shops  and  enterprises  will  be \ndemolished.  Overall,  permanent  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition  will  affect \n205 households and 657 persons in the project counties. Among these, 353 will be ethnic \nminority people, accounting for 54%. To attenuate land acquisition and resettlement impacts, \nresettlement plans have been developed for each county. County governments have endorsed \nthe resettlement plans, and have disclosed them in the community and village offices and to \naffected persons19 in both the Chinese and Kazakh languages on 14 and 17 February 2011. \nResettlement plans have also been posted on the ADB website. Compensation for lost assets \nand resettlement allowance will be paid to the affected persons before construction activities \nbegin, and the livelihood rehabilitation arrangements made in accordance with the resettlement \nplans. Each county PMO and PIU will have at least two full-time resettlement staff, and each \nPIU will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with resettlement \nplan provisions. An independent agency will be engaged to conduct the semiannual external \nmonitoring and evaluation. The total cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is \nCNY56.9 million or $8.4 million in 2010 prices, including contingencies.20 ADB staff and external \nmonitoring institution will supervise and monitor implementation of the resettlement plans to \nminimize grievances of the affected persons. \n27.  The project is classified as category B for the indigenous peoples safeguard. Ethnic \nminorities are the majority population in the project area. All households in urban areas will \nbenefit from the new infrastructure. Not all ethnic minority people speak Chinese. A project \nethnic minority development plan has been prepared that focuses on measures to aid the \ninclusion of ethnic minority men and women in all project activities and to protect them from any \ndisadvantages  that  language  barriers  may  create  with  respect  to  employment  by  project \ncontractors. It also includes measures to ensure that their customs and beliefs will be respected \nthroughout  implementation.  Ethnic  minorities  will  not  be  adversely  affected,  except  in  the \ncontext  of  resettlement.  Livelihood  restoration  measures  associated  with  resettlement  are \nincorporated in the resettlement plans. The project ethnic minority development plan endorsed \nby the government has been disclosed on 11 February 2011 in both the Chinese and Kazakh \nlanguages to ethnic minority people targeted by the project. The ethnic minority development \nplan  has  also  been  uploaded  on  the  ADB  website.  Detailed  monitoring  and  reporting \narrangements are included in the PAM and the project agreement.21 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan. The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs and risks.22 \n                                                \n18 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) trigger for involuntary resettlement changed the terminology of \"affected \npersons\" to \"displaced persons\", which are defined as persons who are physically and/or economically displaced \nas a result of involuntary acquisition of land or involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally \ndesignated  parks  and  protected  areas.  In  the  PRC,  although  the  resettlement  plans  maintain  the  original \nterminology of \"affected persons\u201d, the definition is equivalent to ADB's definition of \"displaced persons\". \n20 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Ethnic Minority Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of project coordination and synchronization  Altay PMO project monitoring and support from project \nbetween agencies  implementation consultant \nContinuation of each PMO\u2019s project management information \nsystem \nDelays in land acquisition approvals and  Prompt implementation of detailed measurement surveys \nimplementation  Early availability of affected persons\u2019 compensation funding \nStrict operational compliance with resettlement plans \nDelays in counterpart funding  Covenanted assurances from county governments for timely \nprovision of counterpart funding, and direct coordination with the \nAltay PMO  \nLack of sustainable operation and maintenance of  Long-term capacity building for water, wastewater, solid waste \nphysical components  management, and road maintenance agencies; funding \nassurance from county governments and capacity building \nsupport; and regular tariff reviews \nDifficulties in complying with ADB procurement  Early mobilization of external procurement specialists to provide \nprocedures  training and ongoing technical support \nFailure of the public to change behavior, thus  Conduct of community-based environment-friendly behavior \nreducing the positive impact of new infrastructure  campaign \non the livability of physical environment \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PMO = project management office. \nSource: ADB. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n29.  The government and APG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n30.
