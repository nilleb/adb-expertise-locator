THE ENSUING PROGRAM \n \n1.  The proposed policy-based loan for the Second Public Efficiency and Financial Markets \nProgram will help the Government of Armenia implement policy and institutional reforms that \nstrengthen fiscal sustainability and support the development of financial and capital markets.1 The \nproposed assistance is the second of this type of assistance by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in Armenia, and aims to continue to (i) strengthen public debt and fiscal risk management \nto support the authorities\u2019 efforts toward fiscal consolidation and reducing financial risks in the \neconomy; (ii) improve money market liquidity and financial market transparency by deepening the \ngovernment securities market and improving the infrastructure for money markets; and (iii) help \ndevelop corporate debt and equity markets by enhancing corporate transparency and developing \nlegislative frameworks for new instruments and investment vehicles. Medium-term reforms in \nthese three policy areas were initiated under the Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program \n(2017\u20132018), and the proposed program (2019\u20132021) will sustain previous reform achievements \nby finalizing newly initiated and complementary reform efforts. \n \n2.  The proposed assistance is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s forthcoming country partnership \nstrategy, 2019\u20132023 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations and business plan for Armenia, \n2019\u20132021, which prioritizes helping Armenia to rebalance its economy toward more resilient and \ninclusive growth, through better and more sustainable mobilization of financial resources to \nprivate sector development.2 The proposed ADB assistance is also in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030,  which  prioritizes  developing  the  financial  sector  and  capital  markets  to  support  the \ndevelopment of the private sector and enhance financial stability (i.e. operational priority area to \nstrengthen governance and institutional capacity). \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  To prepare and support the implementation of the Armenia Second Public Efficiency and \nFinancial Markets Program, a transaction technical assistance (TA) is required, especially with \nregards to the Post-Program Engagement Framework. Through this TA, ADB will continue to \nflexibly provide strategic policy advice to the government.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  The proposed program will aim to strengthen public efficiency and deepen financial \nmarkets in Armenia. The TA and program will have three outputs. Experts will support decision-\nmaking and the technical development of reform proposals to promote these objectives. The \nrequired  deliverables  will  be  in  most  part  confidential  in  a  first  instance,  but  stakeholder \nconsultations will be vehicles for dissemination whenever appropriate.  \n \n                                                \n1  The government confirmed its request for ADB assistance in the January and March consultation missions. An initial \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Transaction technical assistance (TA) will be provided for program \npreparation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n2  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2019\u20132021. Manila. \n ", "2 \n5.  Output 1: Public debt policies and fiscal risk policies strengthened. This output will \ncontinue to enhance fiscal discipline, transparency, and credibility. To this end, the TA will focus \non three key reform areas: ensuring effective risk management function within the Fiscal Risk and \nStatistics Department of the MOF; promotion of fiscally responsible and development-relevant \npublic-private partnerships (PPPs); and development of an effective public debt management \nstrategy. To ensure sound fiscal risk management, the TA program will help ensure that adoption \nof the newly drafted Fiscal Risk management framework roadmap remains on-track whilst \nimproving transparency in reporting and accounting of state-owned enterprises and completion \nof full-fledged risk vetting and monitoring of PPPs. The TA will promote development of fiscally \nresponsible PPPs by assisting with promulgation of the PPP Government Decree and remaining \nsecondary legislation as well as providing legal support to, if necessary, approve amendments to \nthe current Procurement Law which facilitate the requirements of PPP transactions. Finally, in \norder to strengthen the public debt management function, the TA will support  Public Debt \nManagement Department (PDMD) in the implementation of the 2020\u20132022 Medium Term Debt \nStrategy (MTDS) and developing a MTDS update for 2021\u20132023. The TA will ensure gender \ninclusive  training  of  MOF  staff\u2014including  in  the  selection  of  trainees\u2014to  ensure \ninstitutionalization of the abovementioned functions. The main implementing agency will be the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF). The Ministry of Economy (MOE) will also be an implementing agency \nfor this output.  \n6.  Output  2:  The  government  securities  market  deepened  and  financial  market \ninfrastructure improved. Under this output, the TA support will be centered around three key \nreform areas: developing financial and capital markets; improving cash and liquidity management \nand forecasting; and implementation of the Global Master Repo Agreement. To help develop \nfinancial markets, the TA will support MOF and CBA to jointly approve a full-fledged financial and \ncapital markets development program. In order to improve cash management and forecasting, \nthe TA will help PDMD finalize implementation of its time-bound Roadmap to improve Cash \nManagement and support CBA in the approval of necessary regulations for AMX to offer bond \nswitch action solutions. The TA will also help CBA complete the implementation of the time bound \nGlobal Master Repo Agreement Roadmap. The implementing agencies will be the MOF  (through \nthe PDMD) and the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA), with one key implementing partner: the \nArmenia Securities Exchange.  \n7.  Output  3:  Enhancement  of  the  investors  base  and  corporate  transparency \nsupported. This output will lay the foundations for further corporate market development efforts. \nActivities under this output include: development of the legal framework for new types of securities; \nstrengthened  corporate  transparency  standards;  and  ensuring  the  adoption  of  an  effective \ninsolvency framework. To develop a legal framework which is conducive to the issuance of new \ntypes of securities to broaden the investor base, the TA will support the CBA examining the \nregulatory  and  tax  incentive  and  impediments  to  securities  trading  and  issuance.  The \ndevelopment of a joint government/CBA issue draft policy providing recommendations which \npromote different financial instruments in local currency and wholesale financing initiatives to \npromote financial transparency. In order to strengthen corporate transparency, the TA will support \nthe  establishment  and  operationalization  of  the  Public  Oversight  Board  and  Chamber  of \nAccountants and Auditors of Armenia as well  as MOF assessment of options to increase \ntransparency in the public procurement system. The benefits of a gender sensitive approach to \nstaffing will be integrated in the TA\u2019s recommendations to the relevant authorities. Finally, in order \nto further strengthen the insolvency framework, the TA will support the government to maximize \nperformance of the specialized courts for insolvency and suggest improvements in the insolvency \nlegislation  that  ensure  maximization  of  return  to  creditors  in  insolvency  proceedings.  The \nimplementing agencies will be the CBA and the MOE, and two key implementing partners will be \n ", "3 \nthe Armenia Securities Exchange and the recently established Financial Markets Association of \nArmenia. \n8.  The TA will help the government implement the program\u2019s policy actions. The government \nwill be responsible to meet the policy actions. However, some of these will require technical skills \nand expertise, which may not be readily available within the government agencies. Further, \ninternational experience and alternative perspectives can help the government agencies find \noptimal solutions and overcome any issues that inhibit progress. Finally, implementing the policy \nconditions builds capacity within these government agencies, and this support can help entrench \nthe reforms. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $825,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Other sources). The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, domestic transportation, provision of office space, and communication facilities \nfor consultants. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will administer the TA. The TA is expected to be implemented from September 2019 \nto October 2021. The Central and West Asia Regional Department will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants, and procure goods, if applicable. The MOF  will be the executing agency.  \n11.  The MOF, MOE, and the CBA will be the implementing agencies. The TA will also have \ntwo key implementing partners: the Armenia Securities Exchange and the recently established \nFinancial Markets Association of Armenia.  \n12.  All disbursements under the TA will be made following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.3 A team of 16 specialists and one firm are required to meet the program\u2019s \noutputs and activities. Individual consultants will include at least seven international experts (for \na total of 15 person-months) and nine national experts (for a total of 19 person-months). ADB will \nengage the services of international and national consultants, mostly on an individual basis and \nusing a gender sensitive approach, as the required consultants\u2019 skills mix, and qualifications are \ndiverse and difficult to source from one consulting firm. However, specialized entities will be \nengaged directly as firms for particular training activities (e.g., for the staff of the [PDMD] and the \nFiscal Risks Management Department).  \n14.  All consultants will be required to assess the gaps in and binding constraints to the \nfinancial sector development in their area of expertise, assess the arrangements in their particular \narea, and compare these with international best practice to help strengthen the policy matrix for \nconsultations with the government, especially in connection with helping the government develop \nand approve a financial and capital markets development strategy. After the policy matrix has \nbeen agreed, the consultants will help the government implement the program.
