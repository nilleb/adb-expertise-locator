At the request of the Government of Tajikistan (the Government), technical assistance \n(TA) for Improving the Accounting and Financial Management System of the Subsidiaries of \nBarki Tajik was included in the 2003 TA program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \nTA1 (i) will provide hands-on assistance for improving procedures in line with international \nfinancial reporting standards (IFRS), and (ii) improve accounting and computer skills of the staff \nof Barki Tajik and its subsidiaries. The Fact-Finding  Mission  in  March 2003 concluded an \nunderstanding with the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, approach, cost estimates, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Barki  Tajik  is  the  state-owned  utility  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution of electricity in Tajikistan. Prior to the country\u2019s independence, Barki Tajik was a \nGovernment agency, and it became a state joint stock holding company in 1992. Although it is \nfully owned by the Government, Barki Tajik has an autonomous status according to its charter. \nBarki Tajik comprises 10 subsidiary power generation companies, 11 subsidiary distribution \ncompanies, and 7 supporting companies. The chairperson, who has overall responsibility for \noperations, is appointed by the Government and reports directly to the Prime Minister. Over the \nlast 2 years, the financial accounting systems went through a major transformation in response \nto changes in the business environment, the need to meet commitments made to international \nfinancial  institutions,  and  the  demand  for  immediate  investment  to  improve  the  electricity \nnetwork. Barki Tajik must maintain the momentum of transformation and lead its subsidiaries \ntowards a high-quality financial reporting framework. Improved financial disclosure standards in \nterms  of  relevance,  reliability,  materiality,  comparability,  understability  and  timeliness  are \nnecessary for efficient financial allocation of resources. \n \n3.  Different accounting traditions have developed around the world in response to varying \nneeds of users\u2014investors, business operators, and regulators\u2014of financial information. While \nthe  international  accounting  system  has  been  developed  by  the  International  Accounting \nStandards Board (IASB) to meet the needs of participants in the capital markets, in Tajikistan, \nlike other ex-Soviet republics, the accounting standards were developed primarily by the needs \nof central planners when state agencies were the only users of financial information. In the \ncentrally planned economy, the prime function of accounting was to monitor and control the use \nof financial resources to meet planned targets. This system of accounting differed from the IFRS \nin the treatment of (i) matching costs to revenues, (ii) valuation of assets, and (iii) computation \nof the cost of production and distribution. Since the Soviet accounting system was not based on \na double entry accrual accounting system, it failed to correctly record depreciation, pension \nliability provisions, accounts receivable, and valuation of inventories. Since enterprises were \nwholly state-owned and their creditors were also other state-owned agencies, the need for \nindependent financial accounting and reporting was never appreciated. The financial reporting \nsystems of Barki Tajik\u2019s subsidiaries are therefore inappropriate to the needs of a market \neconomy and must be reformulated to a double entry accrual accounting system compliant with \nIFRS to provide prospective investors and creditors a transparent disclosure of the financial \ncondition of the entries.  \n \n4.  Tajikistan is lagging behind other countries in Central Asia in modernizing its financial \nreporting standards and accounting system. The existing national system is largely based on \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 6 February 2003. \n ", "2 \nthe old Soviet accounting system. The banking sector is one exception, where the IFRS has \nbeen introduced  with TA from the World Bank. The Ministry of Finance is also considering \nrevising the country\u2019s accounting standards in line with the IFRS. The International Monetary \nFund (IMF) and the World Bank are encouraging economically significant enterprises (e.g., \ndealing with aluminium, cotton, power, telecom, aviation) to implement the IFRS directly and not \nto wait for the development of new national standards based on the IFRS. \n \n5.  The Government plans to unbundle Barki Tajik and create an enabling environment for \nprivate sector investment in the power sector. Investors will need comparable, transparent, and \nreliable information for evaluation and monitoring of investment options. Dependable financial \nreports are essential for efficient functioning of a  market economy as decisions about the \nallocation of capital relies on credible and understandable financial information. The quality of \naccounting standards\u2014usually based on a set of neutral principles applied in a consistent, \ncomparable way\u2014is critical to the development of a high quality financial reporting structure. If \naccounting standards are to satisfy the objective of having similar transactions and events \naccounted for in similar ways, these standards must be applied in a way that is consistent to \nboth the requirements and intent of the standards, and auditors and regulators must insist on \nrigorous interpretation and application of those standards. Otherwise, the comparability and \ntransparency will be compromised. Sole use of an acceptable accounting standard, however, \ncould not ensure high quality financial information. Effective financial reporting depends on the \nability of the company's management, which is responsible for implementing and properly \ninterpreting and applying generally accepted accounting standards. Thus, effort for improving \nfinancial reports needs to be supplemented with capacity building of technical staff on practical \nday-to-day accounting principles, auditing, and business management.  \n \n6.  Most of the assets operated by Barki Tajik are close to the end of their economic life and \nsignificant  investments  are  immediately  required  to  rehabilitate  and  modernize  existing \ninfrastructure. The Government needs to attract foreign investments in new infrastructure and \nfor modernization of existing energy infrastructure. Annual financial and business reports of \nBarki Tajik\u2019s operations are inadequate to support growing investment requirements. This has \nprompted Barki Tajik to introduce the IFRS at its corporate head office with the support of ADB-\nfunded TA.2 Supported by computer systems, accounting procedures were fully automated for \nfinancial planning and budgeting. As a result, Barki Tajik produced its first IFRS-based annual \nfinancial  report  for  2000  and  2001,  and  used  the  same  basis  for  preparing  the  financial \nprojections for 2002\u20132007. \n \n7.  Currently, Barki Tajik is preparing financial statements using both IFRS (at the head \noffice)  and  Tajik  standards  (at  the  subsidiaries).  The  skill  gap  between  head  office  and \nemployees of the subsidiaries\u2014mostly running a basic manual accounting system\u2014is widening, \nmaking introduction of the IFRS to the 28 subsidiaries an immediate priority. At each subsidiary \nlevel, data is regularly captured in manual form and is later summarized and submitted in \nnonelectronic  form\u2014mostly  in  letters  and  facsimiles\u2014to  the  head  office.  Poor  quality  of \nreporting makes it difficult to verify compliance. Data received from Barki Tajik\u2019s subsidiaries are \nunreliable  as  a  result  of  inconsistent  application  of  current  accounting  principles,  loose \ninterpretation of existing guidelines, and lack of accounting skills. Without proper treatment of \ndepreciation,  accrual  of  accounts,  accounts  receivable,  and  bad  debts  across  the  entire \nsubsidiaries, a true picture of Barki Tajik\u2019s financial performance, profitability, or asset quality \ncannot  be  established.  The  poor  quality  of  financial  report  demands  that  the  financial \nmanagement system\u2014bookkeeping, chart of accounts, systems, processes, and employee \nskills\u2014needs a complete reorganization. Also, this is vital for meeting the key loan covenant on \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n ", "    3 \naccounts receivable which should not be more than three month of gross billing from 31 \nDecember 2004 and onwards. \n \n8.  Barki Tajik will have to lead the process of establishing and improving accounting \nstandards to be used by its subsidiaries. Barki Tajik\u2019s head office team will also act like the \nregulator in interpreting and enforcing consistent application of accounting standards. This is \npossible by extending its efforts at the subsidiary level to achieve greater investor interest and \nconfidence. Barki Tajik has a strategic opportunity to reshape its entire operation: (i) reshape \nand  reengineer  internal  management  reporting  systems;  (ii)  evaluate  internal  performance \nmeasures; (iii) improve external communications with investors and other users of financial \ninformation; (iv) increase understanding of a company's position; and (v) better integrate pricing, \nfinancial reporting, earnings analysis, forecasting, and risk management. This initiative will \nassist future accounting separation of the subsidiaries, leading to eventual restructuring of Barki \nTajik. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s objective is to help Barki Tajik improve the standards of transparency in \nfinancial disclosure of its 28 subsidiaries to complement achievements in the holding company \nunder ADB\u2019s earlier TA (footnote 2). The TA\u2019s scope includes (i) establishing a training center \nfor  educating  the  staff  of  Barki  Tajik  and  its  subsidiaries  in  conversion  of  their  financial \nstatements into the IFRS; (ii) implementing a computerized and automated system for financial \nreporting based on the IFRS; and (iii) based on (i) and (ii), improving Barki Tajik subsidiaries\u2019 \nsystems  for  monitoring  working  capital  to  reduce  accounts  receivables  and  inventories  to \noptimal levels to improve overall financial performance by the IFRS. \n \n10.  The TA will (i) review and assess the accounting and financial systems and processes in \nthe subsidiaries; (ii) design and develop an accounting and financial management system for \nthe subsidiaries following the IFRS and in line with the system being used in Barki Tajik holding \ncompany under the earlier TA; (iii) identify and design a financial management system covering \nareas of cost control, accounts receivable management, budgeting and administration, and \nfinancial planning; (iv) recommend and install appropriate hardware and software for timely \nreporting; and (v) provide reports and training to subsidiary staff. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will replicate the work of the previous TA in a consistent way ensuring that all \nsoftware and training are fully compatible with the previous work. The TA will:  \n \n(i)  conduct  an  initial  workshop  on  the  difference  between  the  two  accounting \nsystems  and  to  review  existing  accounting  system  and  design  systems \ncompatible with those at Barki Tajik; \n \n(ii)  identify  and  implement  the  IFRS  in  three  pilot  tests,  and  establish  the  TA \nmanagement infrastructure with a steering committee and working groups; \n \n(iii)  organize study tour to the Kyrgyz Republic to see the implementation of the IFRS \nat Kyrgyzenergo and learn from their experience on restructuring and unbundling \nof the energy sector, and implement the IFRS in subsidiaries led by each pilot \nteam; \n ", "4 \n(iv)  finalize the IFRS financial reports for 2003 and the 5-year budget, establish \ntemplates for reporting, and develop practical networking and communications \nsolutions;  \n \n(v)  identify and equip a suitable training facility in Dushanbe and establish the \naccounting resources center for training of staff from subsidiaries other than the \nthree pilot ones; and \n \n(vi)  develop an action plan that will correctly reflect accounts receivables, including \ntreatment  of  long-term  accounts  receivables,  amounts  of  bad  debt  to  be \nconsidered for loss provision/write-off for each customer class, and a mechanism \nfor monthly reporting of accounts receivable. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is $500,000 equivalent, including foreign exchange of $341,000 \nand local currency of $159,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to finance \n$400,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $59,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will require 48 person-months of consulting services: 12 person-months from \nthree individual international consultants and 36 person-months from six individual domestic \nconsultants. The consulting team will comprise experts in accounting and financial planning, \nfinancial  reporting,  budgeting  and  training  in  accounting  and  computer  systems.  One \ninternational consultant will be the team leader and will be responsible for coordinating the work \nof international and local consultants. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. The consultants will be responsible for purchasing computers, \nlibrary books, and other equipment as per ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The outline terms \nof reference is given in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  Barki Tajik will be the Executing Agency for the Project. It will assign a project leader and \ncounterpart staff to work with the consultant and will closely monitor the domestic consultants\u2019 \nwork in close coordination with ADB on a regular basis. The TA will be implemented over 12 \nmonths starting in March 2004 and ending in February 2005.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n15.
