INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Maldives has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to develop the capacity of the Maldives Energy Authority (MEA). The \nstrengthening of the institutional framework in the energy sector is one of the key objectives of \nthe government\u2019s Strategic Action Plan for 2009\u20132013.  \n \n2.  A fact-finding mission in September 2011 reached agreement with the government on \nthe  purpose,  outputs,  methodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Maldives has achieved the goal of 100% electrification, with all inhabited islands \nreceiving electricity through diesel-based generators. The Maldives has among the highest \npower generation costs in South Asia currently averaging in excess of $0.30 per kilowatt-hour, \nseveral times higher than those of some other countries in the region.2 Petroleum-based fuels \nare a major import in the Maldives, with the country almost entirely dependent on these imports \nfor power generation. Fuel imports comprise nearly 16% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \nand this has resulted in the Maldives facing the impact of significant fluctuations in international \nfuel prices. \n \n4.  Given international volatility in fossil fuel prices and increasing concerns about energy \nsecurity and climate change mitigation, the government has pledged to be carbon neutral by \n2020. Since the energy sector has a key role to play in achieving this goal, the Ministry of \nHousing and Environment (MHE) formulated the Maldives National Energy Policy & Strategy in \nOctober 2010. Its objectives are to (i) provide all citizens with access to reliable and sustainable \nenergy services at the lowest possible cost; (ii) achieve carbon neutrality in the energy sector by \n2020; (iii) promote energy conservation and energy efficiency; and (iv) increase national energy \nsecurity. \n \n5.  With the announcement of the carbon neutral goal and an expected transition towards \nclean  sources  of  fuel,3 significant  investment  is  envisaged  in  the  electricity  sector  of  the \nMaldives by 2020. The Maldives is also one of the two Asian countries selected for the Scaling \nUp Renewable Energy Program (SREP).4 It is expected that concessional climate funds routed \nthrough the multilateral development banks would increase private sector financing to support \ninvestments  in  the  Maldives,  particularly  in  renewable  energy  (mainly  solar)  and  energy \nefficiency. A significant concern from the perspective of a long-term investor would be the \npresence of a well-defined and predictable regulatory regime. \n \n6.  MEA has been functioning for years under Presidential decree. It has the mandate to \nregulate the energy sector, advise the government on the energy sector, issue licenses to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 October 2011. \n2  This is mainly attributed to the small dispersed nature of the load for the inhabited islands. Each island requires a \nself-contained generating system and is therefore unable to benefit from economies of scale seen in other \ncountries. \n3  The government has targeted up to 60% of electricity to be generated from solar power by 2020. \n4  A targeted program of the Strategic Climate Fund within the framework of the Climate Investment Funds. ADB and \nthe World Bank Group will be supporting the program in Maldives.  \n ", "2   \nengineers and authorization to electricity suppliers, as well as to collect and maintain statistics \non the energy sector. MEA\u2019s functioning has been constrained by the lack of staff, finances, and \na clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities. \n \n7.  Significant changes in the sector\u2019s institutional structure have taken place over the last 3 \nyears including the reorganization of STELCO, the state-owned electricity utility responsible for \npower supply in Mal\u00e9 and nearby islands. There are now seven regional utilities operating \nacross the Maldives and the island development committees5 have been gradually absorbed \nwithin these regional utilities. Utilities, especially the newly formed ones, have reiterated the \nneed for timely guidance on technical, quality, and financial matters from MEA as they seek to \nmeet their obligations. These and other changes necessitate the immediate development of \nappropriate regulations as well as the capacity building of MEA to regulate the sector in this \ntransition period. \n \n8.  The  most  important  priorities  to  foster  greater  investment  in  the  energy  sector,  in \nparticular  in  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency,  are  better  technical,  licensing,  and \nfinancial  regulations.  The  introduction  of  new  technologies  and  innovative  financing \narrangements will require the presence of adequate and functional regulatory oversight in areas \nsuch as investment planning and contracting for utilities. This TA will address these priority \nrequirements and the capacity building needs in MEA. \n \n9.  In October 2011, the World Bank announced support of $200,000 for the MEA. This \nsupport is expected to cover governance arrangements, review of existing power purchase \nagreements, development of the technical regulatory framework, standards of performance, and \ndemand-side energy efficiency regulations. It will also cover the drafting of an institutional \ndevelopment plan. This support, which is expected to commence in 2011, will complement this \nADB TA. An investment framework has been approved by the cabinet to support renewable \nenergy investments. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be the development of an effective regulatory environment for \nthe delivery of affordable, reliable, and clean energy. The performance measures will be the \nestablishment  of  a  regulatory  framework  that facilitates increased interest  from the  private \nsector  in  the  energy  sector  by  2016  and  the  reduction  in  emissions  per  unit  of  power \nconsumption of at least 20% by 2016. The outcome of the TA will be the enhanced capacity of \nthe regulator to support the energy sector objectives. The performance measure will be the \ndevelopment of key regulations for the energy sector and capacity building for the regulator and \nutilities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The outputs of the TA comprise the following: (i) development of key licensing and \ntechnical regulations; (ii) capacity building activities undertaken for MEA; (iii) development of a \ncompliance framework for licensees; and (iv) support for energy efficiency and solar programs. \n                                                 \n5 Island Development Committees have traditionally been responsible for operation of the power-house and supply of \nelectricity to consumers on islands. Regional utilities have taken over this role on most islands. \n ", "  3\nThe outcome can be achieved through adequate and timely support from MHE, MEA, the \nRenewable Energy Investment Office and the licensees. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The Government of Maldives has requested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). \nThe  government  will  provide  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities, \nadministrative  support,  and  other  expenses.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MHE will be the executing agency. A steering group headed by MHE and comprising \nrepresentatives from MHE, MEA, and other agencies will be created to support implementation \nof the TA. MHE will also coordinate with stakeholders, including other ministries, utilities, large \nconsumers, prospective investors, and consumer representatives, to receive their inputs on the \nTA activities. \n \n14.  The TA will require the services of 4 international consultants and 1 national consultant \nfor a total of 14 person-months of consulting services. The international consultants will be: (i) a \nregulatory specialist and team leader (5 person-months), (ii) a technical specialist (4 person-\nmonths),  (iii)  an  energy  efficiency  specialist  (1  person-month),  and  (iv)  a  solar  program \nspecialist  (1  person-month).  The  national  consultant,  will  be  the  consultant  coordinator  (3 \nperson-months).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented from December 2011 to January 2014. Draft reports will be \nsubmitted by consultants and these will be finalized in discussions with MEA. Monthly progress \nreports will be submitted to MHE and ADB to ensure appropriate monitoring and evaluation. \nGood practices and lessons learned through the TA will be disseminated through workshops \nand the internet. \n \n \nIV.
