The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam requested assistance from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  build  the  capacity  of  Electricity  of  Viet  Nam  (EVN)  in \nimplementing the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the Son La Hydropower Project \n(SLHPP). A Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam in August 2005 and reached understanding \nwith the Government on the objective, scope, cost estimates, financing, and implementation \narrangements for the technical assistance (TA).1 The design and monitoring framework for the \nTA is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.   The TA focuses on achieving sustainable and environmentally sound development of the \nenergy sector in Viet Nam. The TA aims at building the capacity of EVN in environmental \nmanagement best practices in relation to developing its hydropower resources, the benefits of \nwhich will include poverty reduction and sustainable livelihood programs for the downstream \narea of the SLHPP. This is in line with the Government\u2019s priorities for poverty reduction as \noutlined in its comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy and other documents.2  \n \n3.  Implementation of an improved EMP for the SLHPP will help those affected by the \nProject to enhance their livelihoods and will help mitigate the Project\u2019s environmental impacts in \na  sustainable  manner.  In  addition,  capacity  built  in  EVN  to  employ  best  practices  in \nimplementing the EMP for areas upstream and downstream from the SLHPP can be extended \nto other EVN power projects. \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.   Electricity demand in Viet Nam grew at an annual rate of 15% during 2000\u20132004 and is \nprojected to continue to grow at this rate until 2010, and then at 12% per year until 2015. To \nmeet this demand, the Government and EVN expect to double installed generating capacity \nfrom 10,871 megawatts in 2004 to 22,600 megawatts by 2010. In addition, high-voltage and \nmedium-voltage  transmission  and  distribution  systems  need  to  be  improved  to  deal  with \ntransmission bottlenecks and reduce losses. EVN\u2019s master plan for the power sector for 2000\u2013\n2010  emphasizes  the  importance  of  developing  hydropower  along  with  other  generation \ntechnologies, mainly because of the country\u2019s abundant water resources and hydropower\u2019s \ncheaper generation costs. However, the country\u2019s large hydropower projects, such as the 2,400-\nmegawatt Son La hydropower plant, are expected to have significant environmental and social \nimpacts, especially downstream.  In provinces such as Lai Chau and Son La and in the central \nhighlands, where large hydropower projects are planned, the poverty rate is significantly higher \nthan  the  national  average.  Therefore  addressing  livelihood  enhancement  issues  for  those \naffected through improved environmental management is as important as developing the power \nprojects.  \n \n5.    ADB\u2019s past involvement in the power sector in Viet Nam focused on extending and \nrehabilitating existing substations and distribution networks. To support EVN\u2019s long-term need \nfor  growth  of  the  generating  and  distribution  capacity,  ADB  approved  the  $120.0  million \nNorthern Power Transmission Sector Project3 to improve the reliability and quality of high-\nvoltage transmission network in the northern region. A follow-up project, the Northern Power \nTransmission Expansion Sector Project (targeted for approval in December 2005), is currently \nbeing prepared to further strengthen transmission networks to enable the evacuation of power \nfrom generation projects currently under construction, improve north-south transmission, and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 16 September 2005. \n2  ADB. 2005.

Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Northern Power Transmission Sector Project. \nManila (L2128-VIE). \n ", "2   \nreduce  system  losses.  Further  ADB  assistance  to  the sector  will be  for  power  generation \nprojects, such as the Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project and the Moung Duong Coal Power \nProject.4 Given that ADB\u2019s focus in the power sector over the next 5 to 10 years will be power \ngeneration projects, there is a need to help build EVN\u2019s capacity to address the adverse impacts \nof such projects and support sustainable development in project areas. The SLHPP is the \nlargest  hydropower  scheme  planned  for  the  country  and  is  part  of  a  master  plan  for  the \nhydropower development cascades on the Da River listed in the Fifth Power Development Plan \n(2000 \u2013 2005). The Project is financed by the Government and EVN for about $2.5 billion (ADB \nis not involved in its financing) and is linked to the proposed Northern Power Transmission \nExpansion Sector Project. The mitigation of SLHPP\u2019s long-term environmental impacts requires \nadequate attention to implementation and monitoring by EVN, whose capacity in this respect \nneeds to be built.  \n \n6.    The  Government  has  various  laws  and  requirements  that  are  relevant  to  this  TA, \nincluding the 1994 Environmental Protection Law, which is being amended; the Water Law, \nwhich governs rights of access to water and to fish in rivers; a law governing the rights to \naccess forest resources, and so on. The Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources \n(MONRE), the authority for issues pertaining to environmental safeguards, and EVN have both \nrecognized  that  the  country\u2019s  capacity  for  formulating  and  implementing  EMPs  for  major \nhydropower projects has been weak and showed strong interest in receiving assistance. EVN, \nin particular, has not only taken the initiative in drafting the initial EMP, but has also expressed \nits desire to undertake measures to improve its EMP and to build its capacity.  \n \n7.    An environmental and social due diligence study conducted in 2005 for the SLHPP \nconcluded that the Son La power management board is proceeding with a modest EMP only for \nthe upstream area. This EMP, the first EMP prepared for a hydropower project of national \nsignificance by EVN, covers the scope of standard impact mitigation activities. ADB reviewed \nthe EMP and found that it could be further improved. In particular, it needed to include a \ncomprehensive list of mitigation and monitoring activities with indicative budgets and institutional \narrangements. Livelihood restoration and enhancement programs, such as aquaculture in the \nreservoir as part of the program to manage downstream impacts, will also be useful. ENV has \nrequested TA to improve the EMP for SLHPP and to build its capacity to implement the EMP. \nEVN envisages the EMP as a prototype for future power projects.  \n \n8.    An environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the SLHPP was submitted to MONRE \nand the National Assembly for review and is still being revised. The EIA focused on assessing \npotential impacts, but did not include an EMP, nor did it address downstream impacts. The final \nEIA for the SLHPP is currently being prepared, and the EMP will become a chapter of that final \nEIA. The EMP prepared by the Son La power management board was meant to be used as a \nguide during project implementation until MONRE officially approves the final EIA. The lessons \nlearned from formulating and implementing the EMP under this TA will be used to finalize the \nEMP for the final version of the EIA. EVN envisions a seamless transition from the current EMP \nto the final EMP. In addition, implementation of the improved EMP for the SLHPP will be carried \nout with the involvement of other hydropower project management boards that may soon need \nto devise their own EMPs, for example, for the Ban Chat and Huoi Quang hydropower plants. \nParticipation by these other management boards is a first step toward replicating the results of \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005.

Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Mong Duong Thermal Power \nGeneration. Manila (TA4670-VIE). \n \n ", "  3\nthe  TA  for  other  hydropower  projects  managed  by  EVN.  Given  that  EVN  is  planning  to \nundertake more than 20 hydropower projects in the next 10 years, opportunities to apply the \nlessons learned from the TA to future projects are substantial.  \n \n9.  Estimates indicate that about 2,000 people currently live in the temporarily flooded area \n(depending on rainy or dry seasons) downstream from the Son La hydropower plant. The \nflooding will reduce people\u2019s incomes by 10 to 50% by 2010, when the SLHPP becomes \noperational. Most of these people are vulnerable because of their high poverty rates (up to 45% \nin some communes); their ethnic origins (more than 60% of residents in most communes are \nminorities);  their  marginal  living  conditions  (little  arable  land  is  available  because  of  the \nmountainous terrain); and their resettlement in the 1980s during the construction of the Hoa \nBinh hydropower plant, which is located downstream from the planned Son La hydropower \nplant. \n  \n10.   Without additional external assistance for the EMP, expectations are that (i) about 2,000 \nto 3,000 hectares of productive land in the temporarily flooded area will be lost permanently, but \nmost households will not be compensated for this loss because they do not have formal titles to \nthe land; (ii) EVN may not be able to restore the livelihoods of these households because of its \nlimited experience in mitigating downstream impacts; and (iii) poverty rates will increase. Field \nsurveys of the downstream area undertaken in July 2005 found that the potential to restore, if \nnot improve, the livelihoods of those living downstream from the SLHPP is high. Local residents \nand  authorities  provided  several  suggestions  in  relation  to  livelihood  restoration  and \nenhancement, the most common of which included developing aquaculture for households \nlosing  productive  land.  By  incorporating  participatory  rural  appraisal  methodology  and  the \ndevelopment  of  alternative  livelihoods  in  the  EMP  and  by  involving  relevant  government \nagencies, nongovernment organizations, and other stakeholders, the expected downstream \nimpacts could be mitigated significantly by providing assistance for pilot aquaculture and other \nlivelihood restoration programs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The expected impact of this TA is the development of environmentally-sensitive power \ngeneration with an emphasis on sustainable development. The outcome will be EVN\u2019s adoption \nof an EMP in line with best practices that is sustainable, environmentally sound, and sensitive to \nupstream  and  downstream  impacts  and  affected  stakeholders;  the  implementation  of  pilot \nlivelihood enhancement programs; and the capacity building of EVN staff. Specifically, the TA\u2019s \npurpose is to (i) improve the formulation and implementation of the EMP for the SLHPP by \ndeveloping the monitoring mechanisms for the EMP, a realistic and sustainable implementation \nbudget for the EMP, and the specific performance indicators for evaluating  improvements in \nEMP outcomes (ii) build the capacity of EVN and the Son La power management board in EMP \ndevelopment and implementation; (iii) ensure that such capacity building is done in such a way \nthat accumulated experience will be used for future hydropower projects; and (iv) formulate and \nimplement a viable livelihood enhancement or restoration pilot program involving aquaculture for \nthose people affected downstream of the SLHPP as part of the EMP. This TA will complement \nand build synergies with other ADB TAs for capacity building in relation to livelihood restoration \nfor people affected by power generation projects.5\n \n12.  The  proposed  TA  will  focus  on  the  following  outputs:  (i)  an  improved  EMP  with  a \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Strengthening Institutional Capacity of \nLocal Stakeholders for Implementation of Son La Livelihood and Resettlement Plan. Manila (TA4690-VIE). \n \n   ", "4   \nmonitoring  program  and  budgets,  including  pilot  livelihood  restoration  and/or  enhancement \nprograms using a participatory approach with downstream stakeholders; (ii) the environmental \nspecifications for contractors, for example, the environmental management requirements to be \nincorporated in contracts and method statements for site EMPs; and (iii) the holding of public \ndisclosure and consultation events in areas affected by the Project. Expected TA results include \n(i) improved capacity of EVN and its power management boards to develop and implement \nhydropower  EMPs;  (ii)  improved  environmental  quality  in  and  near  the  SLHPP  area;  (iii) \nrestored or enhanced livelihoods for people affected by the SLHPP, especially downstream \ncommunities, including by means of aquaculture and fish stocks; and (iv) shared lessons within \nEVN, with its other hydropower plant management boards, and with MONRE. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Various methodologies will be employed to achieve the intended TA outputs, such as \ndesk reviews, field surveys, workshops, and consultations. A participatory approach will be \ngiven priority when developing the livelihood enhancement pilot program with the affected \npeople as part of the EMP mitigation measures. The TA will improve ownership and build \nawareness among decision makers and other stakeholders at the central and provincial levels, \nsuch as government agencies; the private sector; and civil society, including nongovernment \norganizations  and  representatives  of  those  affected  by  power  projects.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented from December 2005 through 2010, with its first activity being the establishment of \na steering committee.  \n \n14.   A small team of individually recruited consultants will help EVN modify, implement, \nmonitor, and report on the EMP for the SLHPP. The assistance will be oriented toward ensuring \nthat the EMP\u2019s scope, content, and activities are in accordance with the safeguard requirements \nof  the  national  and  provincial  governments,  ADB,  and  other  donors  and  with  relevant \ninternational best practices. The targeted EMP will cover, but will not be limited to, the following: \nthe  Son  La  dam  site,  construction  roads,  diversion  channels,  resettlement  sites,  quarries, \nworkers\u2019 camps, waste disposal sites, materials staging and storage sites and other ancillary \nfacilities, and identified sensitive areas both upstream and downstream from the SLHPP. It will \ncover preconstruction, construction, and operational phases. \n \n15.   A brief review of the hydropower sector\u2019s experience with EMPs in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion will be conducted to serve as a reference for the TA work. Best practices will be a \nrecurring theme for each component. Specific components of the TA activities will involve the \nfollowing:  \n(i)  Set up a monitoring system and performance indicators for the EMP, including \n(a) demonstrating the monitoring of mitigation measures to be undertaken by \ncontractors  (referred  to  as  environmental  performance  monitoring)  and \ndocumentation and corrections of these mitigation measures as applicable; (b) \ndemonstrating the monitoring of the Project\u2019s impacts on air, water, soil, and \nbiodiversity (referred to as environmental effects monitoring) with documentation \nand corrections of these monitoring results, with a focus on downstream water \nquality; (c) reviewing the results of monitoring to assess the effectiveness of the \nmitigation measures applied; (d) preparing a sustainable and realistic budget for \nthe EMP; and (e) recommending corrective action based on the results of the \nmonitoring. \n(ii)  Help build capacity in EVN, including (a) assisting EVN to revise and improve the \nEMP in accordance with the safeguard requirements of ADB and other donors \nand  following  international  best  practices;  (b)  train  staff  from  EVN,  Son  La \nHydropower Project Management Board, and other related agencies in EMP \nformulation  and  implementation;  and  (c)  draft  contractor  specifications  for \n ", "  5\nenvironmental  management  and  strengthen  the  awareness  of  construction \ncontractors  in  relation  to  the  design  and  implementation  of  their  site  EMPs. \nGuidance and assistance will be provided by the TA consultants for drafting \nthese documents based on EMP best practices. \n(iii)  Engage in public participation and consultation, including (a) strengthening the \nuse  of  a  participatory  approach  in  relation  to  EMP  implementation  and \ncooperation between project owners and related parties, such as MONRE and \nprovincial departments of Natural Resources and Environment, and Agriculture \nand Rural Development; (b) conducting disclosure and consultation events with \nthose  affected  by  the Project;  and  (c)  developing  options  for integrating  the \nresults of consultations into the Project and into improvements of the EMP. \n(iv)  Initiate pilot livelihood improvement activities by, for example, coordinating with \nthe  Danish  International  Development  Agency\u2019s    fishery  program  in  Son  La \nprovince and other donor programs; conducting participatory rural appraisal; and \ntesting the pilot livelihood improvement program to see its future applicability in \nthe downstream area. \n16.  The consultants will provide interim and final reports and will disseminate summary \nreports in both Vietnamese and English to stakeholders by means of workshops and web sites, \nfollowing approval by ADB, as part of the public communications and disclosure process. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n17.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,050,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $700,000 and the local currency cost is $250,000. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $800,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and \na portion of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government \nof Finland and will be administered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining cost of \n$250,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs  through  in-kind  contributions.  Detailed  cost \nestimates and the financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements  \n18.  The executing agency for the TA will be EVN. ENV will set up a steering committee to \nimplement the TA activities that will consist of representatives from MONRE, the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Fisheries, the Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development,  provincial  departments  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment  and  Natural  Resources  and  Environment,  provincial  and  district  peoples \nCommittees, and EVN. The main role of the committee will be to guide the implementation of \nthe TA and to advise on the overall policy direction. The team of individual consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The TA will require a total \nof  54  person-months  of  consulting  services,  consisting  of  28  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants and 26 person-months of international consultants in the areas of environmental \nassessment and aquaculture, and will be carried out over a 61-month period commencing in \nDecember  2005  and  ending  in  December  2010.
