INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will prepare energy system \ndevelopment scenarios and technology road maps and support the scale-up of innovative energy \ntechnologies in developing member countries (DMCs). The TA cluster is aligned with the energy \npolicy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It will support ADB in implementing its Strategy \n20301 and  DMCs  in  meeting  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  including  their \nnationally determined contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement on climate change. \nThe TA cluster is included in the ADB Management-approved Energy Sector Group (ESG) work \nplan for 2018-2019. \n \n2.  The TA cluster outputs have been identified in consultation with ADB\u2019s energy divisions \nand based on reviews and assessments of relevant regional TA projects (para. 5). The TA cluster \naims to achieve greater development impact through energy sector technology innovations in \nADB operations to meet the SDGs and NDCs in Asia and the Pacific.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The  SDGs  and  NDCs  encourage  a  transformative  change  in  production  systems, \nemployment patterns, technologies, behaviors, and lifestyles to enable poverty reduction and a \ntransition towards efficient low-emission production and consumption. Access to reliable, clean, \nand affordable cost-effective energy remains a key development imperative for DMCs. As of 2014, \n421 million people in Asia and the Pacific were still living without access to electricity;3 most of \nthis population live in remote areas and islands. With business-as-usual solutions\uf0besuch as \nnational  grid  extension,  centralized  power  generation,  and  low-efficiency  end-use \ndevices\uf0beDMCs will either not be able to achieve universal energy access or will not achieve it \nwithout producing much higher emissions. Innovations in the energy sector and other sectors \n(e.g., urban, transport, agriculture, water, information and communication technology) will provide \nnew opportunities to meet DMC energy sector needs faster and  leapfrog to lower carbon energy \nsector development pathways. \n \n4.  Innovative technologies and business models4 are needed by DMCs to facilitate and \nspeed up transitions, and infrastructure investments must be future-proofed regarding rapid \ntechnological evolution and climate change. However, many DMCs have limited knowledge or \nexperience in determining the benefits and risks associated with innovative energy technologies \nand business models; therefore, they often default to conventional carbon intensive approaches. \nDMCs may be reluctant to embrace cutting-edge technologies given the lack of understanding of \nthe benefits and risks of using them, as well as perceived higher costs. \n \n5.  ADB can increase the use of innovative technologies in its operations since it has gained \nvaluable experience from a broad spectrum of investments and TA, demonstrating a growing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 April 2018. \n3 United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). 2017. Asia\u2013Pacific Progress \nin Sustainable Energy: A Global Tracking Framework 2017 Regional Assessment Report. Bangkok. \n4 The emphasis will be on sustainable technologies and supporting business and regulatory models that can be scaled \nup across many ADB DMCs. These technologies include but are not limited to waste-to-energy, renewable \ngeneration,  sustainable  hydropower,  thermal  energy  and  electricity  storage,  electric  mobility,  demand-side \ntechnologies that support energy efficiency and electricity system operational support, efficient and clean heating \ntechnologies,  decentralized  technologies  that  can  support  access  to  energy,  and  enabling  information  and \ncommunication technologies, including smart grids. \n ", "2 \ndemand for innovative solutions by DMCs. The midterm review5 of the regional TA cluster for \nEstablishing a Pilot Center to Facilitate Climate Change Technology Investments in Asia and the \nPacific6 identified the need to (i) determine technology options through country-specific analysis \nmore strategically; (ii)  create a more direct link with ADB operations and the lending pipelines; \nand (iii) bring projects into early assistance discussions with ADB (as either stand-alone projects \nor components of larger projects) to ensure DMC ownership and commitment, country relevance, \nand increase the likelihood of upscaling. ADB\u2019s regional TA cluster for Promoting Sustainable \nEnergy for All in Asia and the Pacific7 has demonstrated the need for increased pilot projects to \ndemonstrate the ability to standardize solutions and support, and scale-up opportunities for \npromising technologies. ADB\u2019s regional TA for Promoting Carbon Capture and Storage in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and Indonesia8 has identified the need to focus more on using carbon \ndioxide to support business models and to learn by doing for carbon capture and storage \ndevelopment. \n \n6.  High-impact innovative energy technologies can be scaled up by performing practical \nanalysis through energy technology road maps and future-looking scenarios to identify and match \nregion-, country-, or city-specific energy needs with sustainable energy technology, regulatory, \nand business model solutions, followed by testing of the applicability of these solutions in real-\nworld situations. A holistic approach is needed to develop investments in technology areas that \noffer the best prospects for (i) driving cost and price reductions to improve the affordability and \nvalue of services; (ii) minimizing risk for early adopters; and (iii) accelerating scale-up and \nreplication, with minimal environmental and social footprints and relative ease of implementation. \nSuch an approach would demonstrate actual costs, challenges, and benefits, which would enable \na realistic assessment of value and support cost reduction through technology deployment and \nrisk mitigation. \n \n7.  To mobilize and accelerate investment at the scale necessary to address the SDGs and \nNDCs, ADB needs to deliver innovative technical and financial assistance that can improve the \nbankability of infrastructure projects, especially in the energy sector. Pilot projects are often \nneeded to demonstrate in-country technology viability, and dissemination of the knowledge \ngained through these pilots by connecting Asian countries with knowledge developed in Asia and \nthe Pacific is important along with global knowledge transfer. The TA cluster approach will enable \nthe broad sharing of best practices across multiple countries and regions and technologies, \nseeking  commonalities  and  differences  to  adjust  approaches  to  meet  the  overall  lending \nobjectives of ADB. \n \n8.  Scaling up initial deployments of high-level technology investments remains challenging. \nBarriers to renewable energy development persist; e.g., where agriculture activity is the highest \npriority, utility-scale solar power development may not be viable. Renewable resources may be \nabundant, but energy pricing policies and concerns around integrating with power systems limit \ncommercial development. Opportunities for many technologies\uf0besuch as energy-efficient heating \nand cooling, more efficient and low-cost sustainable hydropower, carbon capture and storage, \nand waste-to-energy\uf0beneed to be identified in specific countries first and then adapted to country-, \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016.

These instances should be complemented with knowledge \nproducts and capacity building to intensify development. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n9.  A TA cluster approach  is the most appropriate means of supporting the increased use of \ninnovative sustainable energy technology. Strategically linked subprojects will support a program \nof activities covering the development of energy system scenarios and technology road maps; \ncity-,  country-,  or  region-specific  feasibility  studies;  pilot-testing  of  innovative  technologies; \ncapacity development; and knowledge sharing. Together, these activities will enable critical \ntechnical  and  economic  analytical  work,  support  the  development  of enabling  policies  and \nregulatory requirements, and deliver on the country-based capacity to evaluate energy system \nneeds with the common objective of advancing the use of a number of technologies over the short \nto medium term. The TA cluster approach provides the flexibility to support technology and \ncountry-specific needs by designing subprojects during the TA cluster implementation period. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n10.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: access to reliable, low-carbon, and \ncost-effective  energy  increased.9 The  TA  cluster  will  have  the  following  outcome:  use  of \nsustainable innovative technologies in participating DMCs increased, with the following five \noutputs.10 \n \n11.  Output 1: Energy system scenarios and technology road maps produced. The TA \ncluster  will  support  the  development  and  dissemination  of  energy  system  projections  and \ntechnology road maps that demonstrate sustainable energy system development pathways for \nspecific cities, countries, or subregions in consideration of their NDCs. \n \n12.  Output 2: City-, country-, and/or region-specific feasibility studies for pilots or \ninvestments produced.  The TA cluster will provide support to ADB\u2019s regional departments and \nthe Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) for feasibility studies for innovative energy \ntechnologies,11 focusing on costs, environmental and public health benefits to consumers, carbon \nfootprint, sustainability and deployment considerations, and scalability and future investment \npotential specific to supporting ADB\u2019s pipeline. \n \n13.  Output 3: Pilot testing of innovative technologies deployed. The TA cluster will \nidentify and support pilot demonstrations of innovative technologies and business models in \ncoordination with ADB\u2019s regional departments, including cross-sector and thematic initiatives with, \nbut not limited to, water, transport, environment, and urban sector groups; the Climate Change \nand Disaster Risk Management Thematic Group; and the Digital Technology for Development \nUnit.12 \n                                                \n9  Defined by TA. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 Technologies supported by output 2 will be consistent with the analysis performed in output 1, the country NDC, the \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  and/or specific  projects in the  operation\u2019s pipeline.  This  will ensure  that \ntechnologies are chosen deliberately and not in an ad hoc manner. \n12 Cross-sector initiatives could include projects with energy aspects in addition to sector-specific topics. Examples \ncould  include  water  management  and  energy  production  (water  and/or  climate  change  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement), electric mobility (transport), waste to energy (urban and/or environment), and smart energy systems \n(digital technology for development). \n ", "4 \n \n14.  Output  4:  Prefeasibility  analysis  for  carbon  capture,  utilization,  and  storage \nprepared and published. In coordination with ADB\u2019s regional departments and PSOD, the TA \ncluster will focus on carbon utilization opportunities rather than storage-only approaches.13 \nBecause of the typical scale and overall cost of such projects, the TA cluster will be limited to \nprefeasibility analysis to determine the needs for additional support and potential demonstration \nand deployment. \n \n15.  Output  5:  Regional  knowledge  sharing  and  support  of  scale-up  of  innovative \ntechnologies and suitable business models disseminated. The TA cluster will deliver capacity \nbuilding and knowledge sharing (especially supporting experience transfer and connectivity \nacross  Asia  and  the  Pacific)  to  ensure  that  the  knowledge  developed  and  the  applicable \ntechnologies identified (including new and existing technologies not well known across the region) \ncan be shared throughout Asia and the Pacific to promote sustainable innovative technology \ntransfer and deployment. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $6.6 million, of which (i) $1 million will be financed on \na grant basis by the Climate Change Fund,14 (ii) $2 million will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Carbon Capture and Storage Fund15 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, \n(iii) $1 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund16 under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility, (iv) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the \nClean Technology Fund, (v) $1 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, (vi) $1 million will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUrban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund17 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility, \nand (vii) $0.1 million will be financed on a grant basis by the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each TA \nsubproject proposal submitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB, through ESG of the Sector Advisory Service Cluster of the Sustainable Development \nand Climate Change Department, will administer the TA cluster and will be the executing agency. \nESG will closely liaise with ADB\u2019s regional departments, PSOD, and other sector and thematic \ngroups as well as DMC stakeholders to ensure that (i) they each understand the support and \nresources available from this TA cluster and the means to access those resources; (ii) the TA \ncluster outputs support their operations; and (iii) the analysis and pilots are demand-driven in \nnature, have strong ownership in the country of focus, and have replication opportunities, both in-\ncountry and in other regions, providing the highest potential to support ADB lending pipeline \ndevelopment. \n \n                                                \n13 Countries and technologies supported by output 4 will be consistent with the analysis performed in output 1 in addition \nto current and/or planned use of fossil fuels. This will ensure that studies are chosen in a deliberate fashion that can \naddress emissions from both the power sector and industry. \n14 Established by ADB. \n15 Financing partners: Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute and the Government of the United Kingdom. \n16 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n17 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  November 2018\u2013September 2023 \nfor the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  ADB (Energy Sector Group) \nImplementing agency  ADB (Energy Sector Group) \nConsultants  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by \nFirm/s  Quality- and cost- ADB for subprojects 1, \nbased selection  2, and 3  \nIndividuals   Individual  ADB for subprojects 1, \nconsultant selection  2, and 3 \nDisbursement  The TA cluster resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).
