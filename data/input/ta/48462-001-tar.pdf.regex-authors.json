INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  A series of loan and technical assistance (TA) projects is being prepared to support \ncoordinated development in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region with a focus on sustainable \nand inclusive growth. Immediate support includes four TA projects and one sovereign loan to \npromote  policy  reforms  in  areas  of  air  pollution  reduction,  balanced  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, and low-carbon transport.1 \n \n2.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \nTA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for coordinated development in the BTH region. \nADB fielded a mission in May 2015 and reached an understanding with the government on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for \nconsultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 The TA is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015 for the PRC.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Beijing municipality, Tianjin  municipality, and Hebei province make up an important \neconomic region in the PRC. The region is home to 109.2 million people and generates a gross \ndomestic product of about CNY6.2 trillion, accounting for 10% of the national total in 2013. The \nregion  also  has  the  world\u2019s  eighth  largest  urban  agglomeration  of  Beijing  (19.5  million \ninhabitants as of 1 July 2014) with the fastest average annual population growth rate of 4.6% \namong the top 10 city agglomerations in the world during 2010\u20132015.4 \n \n4.  Even though the BTH region is geographically connected, the socioeconomic structure is \ndisconnected.  Beijing  and  Tianjin  are  two  special  municipalities  directly  under  the  central \ngovernment and have advanced manufacturing capacity and strong tertiary sector. Hebei is less \ndeveloped, with a vast peri-urban and rural hinterland, and lags in overall regional development. \nThe gross domestic product per capita of Hebei was only 42% of that of Beijing and 39% of \nTianjin in 2013. About 88% of the 3.1 million people in poverty in the BTH region live in Hebei.5 \nAs a result of the available business opportunities, high-quality education, and health care \nresources,  Beijing  has  attracted  too  many  residents.  Heavy  smog,  sprawling  traffic,  and \nnotoriously long commutes downgrade the living standards of the residents. Beijing is facing the \nso-called megalopolis disease challenge. \n \n5.  For  the  BTH  region  as  a  whole,  in  addition  to  imbalanced  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, air pollution is a huge health and environmental challenge threatening all BTH \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB).

New York. \n5  Based on Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei National Economic and Social Development Statistical Communiques in \n2014. \n ", "2   \nregional residents. As part of unprecedented rapid growth, the BTH region suffers from air \npollution  resulting  from  industrialization,  urbanization,  and  motorization.  The  BTH  region \nencompasses  a  large  area  with  diverse  sources  of  pollutants,  including  emissions  from \nautomobiles in metropolis such as Beijing, coal based power plants and energy-intensive and \npolluting industries in Tianjin and Hebei, emissions from the vessels and equipment in Tianjin \nport, and coal based boilers for residential heating and seasonal stalk burning on farm lands in \nHebei. All three jurisdictions have adopted air pollution reduction strategies; for example, Hebei \nProvincial Government (HPG) has committed to reduce PM concentration by 25% by 2017 \n2.5 \nthrough reduction of industrial production capacities and other related methods.6 However, there \nhas been a lack of coordinate effort to work jointly among the three areas. \n \n6.  Against this backdrop, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of \nChina approved the Program Outline for Coordinated Development of the BTH Region (the \nprogram outline) on 30 April 2015. The program outline aims to develop a more coordinated \nBTH region by 2030, mainly through transfer of some industry capacities and public service \nfacilities  out  of  Beijing  to  neighboring  areas,  including  some  energy-intensive  industries, \nwholesale  markets,  public  service  entities,  and  state-owned  enterprises  and  administrative \ninstitutions. Accordingly, the following phased targets have been set:  \n(i)  By  2017,  breakthroughs  in  transport  integration,  environmental  protection,  and \nindustrial upgrading in the BTH region will be achieved, with \u201cremarkable progress\u201d \nmade in curing for Beijing\u2019s megalopolis disease.  \n(ii)  By 2020, the pressure of congestion and air pollution will ease, as the population of \nBeijing is expected to be controlled at 23 million. Regional industry linkage will be \ncreated. Social development gaps within the BTH region will be reduced with solid \nprogress in public service equalization.  \n(iii)  By 2030, an integrated BTH region will be created, with a rationalized economic \nstructure, improved environment, and generally equalized public service.  \n \n7.  To achieve these targets, the central government of the PRC will carry out a large \nnumber of projects involving relocating industry capacities and public service facilities from \nBeijing  to  nearby  provinces;  initiating  BTH  region-wide  industrial  transformation;  equalizing \nbasic  public  services;  improving  air  quality  control;  developing  integrated  urban  and  rural \ntransport system; constructing a megalopolis area in the BTH region and creating an integrated \nscience and technology innovation market. The program outline also recommends enhanced \npolicy coordination and further reform of present systems and institutions during the program \nimplementation at the local government level. \n \n8.  However, the program outline does have some shortcomings:  \n(i)  The main focus of the program outline was to solve the megalopolis disease facing \nBeijing rather than achieve economic integration of the BTH region. More detailed \neconomic analysis and innovative reform design should be integrated into the \nimplementation  plan  of  local  governments  involved  to  ensure  those  central \ngovernment-initiated  projects  contribute  to  sustainable  region-wide  economic \ndevelopment and integration.  \n(ii)  Central government projects will be assigned to local governments using a top-\ndown approach, where coordination among the same level of local governments is \nweak or even missing.  \n                                                \n6 2013, Hebei Clean Air Action Plan, Hebei.   \n ", "  3 \n(iii)  The relocation of industry capacities and public service facilities from Beijing may \ncreate new environmental and social challenges in the relocating region, especially \nHebei. \n \n9.  To help improve the air quality of Hebei and the BTH region, ADB prepared a policy-\nbased loan (PBL) to Hebei, the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Air Quality Improvement Program. The \nPBL model, which has not been used before in Hebei, is complicated to implement for local \ngovernment when compared with traditional project lending. It involves adjustments to policies \nand investment plans and capacity building of institutions. Smooth implementation of the PBL \ndepends on the capacity of HPG and close implementation monitoring from ADB. The Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Air Quality Improvement Program supports the HPG to (i) reduce emissions from \nmajor air pollution sources, (ii) strengthen environmental policy and the institutional framework \nfor implementation, and (iii) enhance employment support for inclusive industrial transformation. \nBased on international experiences, air quality improvement in the BTH region is a long-term \nchallenge. ADB is committed to continued support in the medium term. \n \n10.  The proposed TA will support the HPG to implement the program outline through (i) \ndesigning its own implementation policies related to creating a megalopolis in the BTH region, \nupgrading  Hebei  industries,  equalizing  basic  public  services,  creating  a  regional  science-\ntechnology market, and eliminating the poverty belt around Beijing and Tianjin; (ii) enhancing \npolicy coordination within the BTH region; and (iii) facilitating the implementation of the Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Air Quality Improvement Program. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The impacts will be increased integrated, sustainable and inclusive economic growth, \nand reduced air pollution in the BTH region. The outcome will be better coordination of program \noutline implementation in Hebei and development in the BTH region. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will assess the Hebei provincial development experience, design the program \noutline implementation policies for Hebei, and enhance policy coordination  within the BTH \nregion to facilitate the implementation of the program outline and the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Air \nQuality Improvement Program. The program has three outputs: \n \n13.  Output 1: Formulation of Hebei program outline implementation policy supported. \nIn  the  summary  report,  the  consultants  will  review  the  experiences  of  Hebei  economic \ndevelopment. They will also assess the economic integration status of the BTH region and \nidentify main challenges Hebei is facing, such as limitations of the present industrialization \nstrategy  focusing  on  heavy  industries,  and  comparative  advantages  of  Hebei  from  the \nperspective of an integrated BTH region. The consultants will also analyze how Hebei can \nbenefit from future integration and develop a plan for how Hebei can achieve more sustainable \nand inclusive growth. The effectiveness of the policy actions under the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Air \nQuality Improvement Program will be analyzed. Based on the summary report, this TA will \nprovide policy notes for the HPG. \n \n14.  In addition to the summary report, there will be the following five thematic reports: \n ", "4   \n(i)  Construction  of  world-class  megalopolis  area  in  BTH  region  Based  on \ninternational  and  local  megalopolis  area  development  experience,  the \nconsultants will design a development path for an inclusive and environmentally \nsustainable BTH city cluster. \n(ii)  Upgrading of Hebei industries. The consultants will assess the Hebei heavy \nindustry development experience and design a more environmentally sustainable \nHebei industry strategy. \n(iii)  Equalization of education, health care, and other basic public services. The \nconsultants will assess the BTH basic public service disparity status and make \npolicy recommendations for BTH regional basic service equalization. \n(iv)  Creation  of  a  regional  science-technology  innovation  market.  The \nconsultants will review the present BTH science-technology market development \nstatus,  and  make  recommendations  on  the  creation  of  an  integrated  BTH \nregional science-technology market. \n(v)  Further study on elimination of the poverty belt around Beijing and Tianjin. \nThe consultants will review the government\u2019s poverty reduction achievements \nand  recommend  future  poverty  reduction  measures  through  integrating  a \npractical  environmental  compensation  mechanism  and  BTH  regional  joint \ncontribution arrangement. \n \n15.  Two workshops to review the interim and the draft final summary reports will be held. \nTripartite meetings involving ADB staff, the consultants, and the HPG will be held frequently to \nreview  the  progress  of  TA  implementation,  offer  guidance  to  the  consultants,  and  review \nconsultants\u2019 reports. After submission of the final report, the HPG, with support from ADB, will \nhold a symposium for the dissemination of the TA findings.  \n \n16.  Output  2:  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  regional  policy  coordination  enhanced.  Five \nthematic reports under output 1 cover the main challenges three BTH regional governments \nfacing during BTH region integration. To enhance BTH region-wide policy dialogue, when the \ndraft thematic reports are completed, the consultants will arrange and conduct a series of \nconsultation conferences led by the HPG, with support from ADB, to present the findings and \nrecommendations to stakeholders concerned, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei government  \nagencies;  private  enterprises;  and  research  institutes.  Comments  and  feedback  from \nconferences will be incorporated into the final reports and policy notes. After each consultation \nconference,  the  HPG  will  share  discussion  records  and  policy  notes  with  the  BTH  region \ngovernment agencies for further policy coordination. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Effectiveness  of  the  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Air  Quality  Improvement \nProgram  policy  actions  assessed.  The  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Air  Quality  Improvement \nProgram supported by ADB\u2019s PBL in strengthening Hebei\u2019s framework for incremental policy \nand  investment  actions to  improve the  air quality  in  the  BTH  region  (planned  approval  in \nDecember 2015), includes 17 key policy reform actions and 10 key performance monitoring \nindicators    in  three  areas  mentioned  in  paragraph  9.  The  consultants  will  monitor  the \nimplementation of the program, assess the effectiveness of the HPG-agreed 17 key policy \nactions, and make suggestions regarding future medium- and long-term reform and investment \nneeds. The output will be the basis for future dialogue between ADB and HPG to scale up the \npartnership in the BTH region. \n \n \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The HPG will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office space and local transport, remuneration and per diem \nof local support staff, workshops, and equipment, and will assist in arranging meetings with \ncounterpart agencies. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months, from 15 December 2015 to 15 August \n2017. Representing the HPG, the Hebei Provincial Finance Bureau (HPFB) will be the executing \nagency.  The  HPFB  will  coordinate  with  Hebei,  Tianjin,  and  Beijing  government  agencies; \nacademia; and other stakeholders, and assign counterpart staff to assist the consultants. The \nInternational Division of the HPFB, as the implementing agency, will supervise the day-to-day \nwork of the consultants and assume overall responsibility for workshops and conferences. \n \n20.  Three  international  consultants  (5  person-months),  eight  national  consultants  (32 \nperson-months), and several resource persons will be recruited. The international consultants \nwill provide international experiences and organize an overseas study tour in ADB member \ncountries on megalopolis development. The national consultants will have expertise in economic \ndevelopment planning, urban planning, macroeconomics, as well as fiscal and taxation policies. \nThe resource persons will participate in the consultation conferences and workshops to provide \nspecific expertise and experiences relevant to the issues addressed by the event. \n \n21.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  through  a  consulting  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method following the simplified technical proposal procedure. The \nweighted ratio of technical\u2013financial proposal will be 80:20. All reports will be submitted in both \nEnglish and Chinese to the HPFB and ADB, in hard and electronic copies, by the consulting \nfirm. The final outputs will be posted online in both languages. The consultants will maintain \nclose working relations with ADB and the HPFB and will regularly discuss progress and findings. \nTripartite meetings involving ADB, the HPFB, and consultants will be held when necessary to \nprovide guidance to the consultants and to review draft reports. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented in close coordination with related ADB-supported projects \ntargeting coordinated development in the BTH region. The TA will be monitored and evaluated \nbased on satisfactory implementation and delivery of outputs following the agreed time line and \nbudget allocation. To support monitoring and evaluation, the consulting team will submit an \ninception report, a midterm report, a draft final and a final report to the HPFB and ADB. TA \nreview missions will be conducted periodically to monitor progress, assess performance, and \nensure relevance. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Study  on  the  Coordinated \nDevelopment of Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with \nBTH region integrated sustainable and inclusive economic growth increased (2015, Program Outline for \nCoordinated Development of the BTH Region, Beijing) \nAir pollution in the BTH region reduced (Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, 2013\u2013\n2017) \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nThe program outline  a.
