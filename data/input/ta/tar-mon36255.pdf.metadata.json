At the request of the Government of Mongolia, technical assistance (TA) to promote off-\ngrid renewable energy, for small-towns in rural areas of Mongolia was included in the 2002 TA \nprogram of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA1 will assist the Government to develop \na  renewable  energy  strategy  for  isolated  rural  areas,  study  hybrid  pilot  systems  that  may \ncomplement  existing  diesel  generation  in  schools  and  hospitals,  and  analyze  options  for \nmainstreaming  renewable  energy  to  improve  access  for  poor  nomadic  families.  The  Fact-\nFinding Mission in July 2002 and subsequent communications concluded an understanding with \nthe Government on the goals, purpose, scope, approach, cost estimates, and implementation \narrangements for the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In Mongolia, the primary commercial energy resources are indigenous coal and imported \npetroleum products. Coal is used for generating electricity and heat; petroleum products are \nused mainly for transportation and electricity generation in isolated systems. The country has \nlarge coal reserves (about 50 billion metric tons). Although about one fifth of the coal is high \nquality, only the low quality brown coal (lignite) adjacent to the population centers is currently \nmined.  Mongolia  also  has  limited  hydropower  resources,  which  remain  undeveloped. \nHydrocarbon deposits have not been fully surveyed but are thought to hold potential. Traditional \nfuels such as animal dung and wood are used in many remote areas where it is difficult to \nsupply  commercial  energy  resources.  The  Mongolian  thermal  power  generation  capacity \nconsists of seven coal-fired combined heat and power generation plants and numerous diesel \npower stations, mostly, off-grid province and village centers.  \n \n3.  Three  independent  transmission  grids  (the  Central  Energy  System  or  CES,  Eastern \nEnergy System or EES, and Western Energy System or WES) and five isolated province \ncenters cover the vast country. The CES reaches about 53% of the population and covers 40% \nof the land. In 2000, the grid supply amounted to 3,130 gigawatt-hour (GWh) with a total load of \n558 megawatt (MW). CES supplied more than 96%, EES about 2%, WES 0.7%, and the five \nisolated province centers 1.2%. The average load factors are: CES 65%, EES 61%, WES 32% \nand isolated imag centers 36%. Both the CES and WES are connected to the Russian grid and \nWES relies mostly on imported energy from Russia. The electricity grid of the CES consists of a \nlarge 220 kV and 110 kilovolt (kV) transmission network. It comprises 5 substations at 220 kV \nand 54 at 110 kV. A 220 kV ring system interconnects the principal generation and load centers \nof Darkan, Erdenet, and Ulaanbaatar, and further 220 kV interconnections are going to the load \ncenters of Baganuur and Choir. The CES 220 kV grid is connected to the Russian system by a \n220 kV double circuit line. Primary distribution is mainly at 35 kV. \n \n4.  The Government initiated a rapid transformation from a centrally planned to a market-\noriented economy in 1990. ADB loan2 conditions required the Government to implement the \nrestructuring action plan for the energy sector, which included enactment of the energy law.  \nThe  Energy  Law  provides  a  basic  regulatory,  inspection,  and  enforcement  structure  for \nproducers, suppliers, and consumers. It allows private and public sector involvement in the \nproduction  of  energy  and  establishes  key  policies  in  areas  of  tariff,  energy  efficiency, \nenvironmental  quality,  and  safety.  The  Mongolian  electricity  industry\u2015with  total  installed \ncapacity of only 830 MW\u2015was recently unbundled into 18 companies including 9 generation, 4 \nelectricity distribution, 2 heat distribution, and 3 electricity transmission companies. Independent \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 June 2002.  \n2  ADB.  1994.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  Mongolia  for  Power \nRehabilitation Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \nregulation was also introduced as part of the deregulation initiative. A single buyer model is \nbeing implemented as a proxy for implementing a wholesale electricity market. Under the \nmodel, the transmission companies will allocate a proportion of their revenues to distribution \ncompanies under the guidance of the Energy Regulatory Authority (ERA). ERA has power, to \nset requirements for licenses for generation, transmission, distribution, dispatching of heat and \nelectricity;  issue  and  revoke  licenses;  develop  methodology  for  determining  tariffs;  resolve \ndisputes between licensees; and define the level of supply reliability. ERA was established with \nits representative offices in each of the 18 provinces. The grid covers 97% of the total electricity \nsupply. Currently 33% of the population does not have access to electricity; 10% of those \nwithout electricity live in village centers and 82% live in remote rural area.  \n \n5.  The Government has focused on improving rural living conditions to arrest the increasing \nmigration of rural population to cities, in particular to the capital Ulaanbaatar. This creates \ndemand on schools, hospitals, and other social infrastructure services that can not be met in the \nshort to medium term. Many rural cities were relying on economic activities created by the \nalmost 1 million former Soviet soldiers that were permanently posted along the border with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. After the withdrawal of the soldiers, general economic activities in \nthese remote areas have shrunk; as a result, Government funds are no longer made available \nfor public infrastructure for health, education, and energy supply. The disparity between the \nreality  and  expectations  based  on  past  service  levels  are  contributing  to  the  accelerated \nmigration toward city centers, particularly to Ulaanbatar. Poor electricity supply is a contributor \nto the deterioration of these public services in rural areas.  \n \n6.  Each  village  administrative  center  has  administrative  buildings,  houses,  schools, \ndormitories,  hospitals,  communication  facilities,  other  public  utilities,  and  some  permanent \nprivate houses. Village centers provide health care, education, and other supplies for the day-to-\nday  needs  of  nomadic  people,  making  them  hubs  for  the  nomadic  lifestyle.  The  herding \npopulation  needs  electricity  for  cooking,  milk  processing,  sewing,  and  lighting  for \nreading\u2015functions that are mostly carried out by women and children in a family. Village \nschools are the only formal option for a child\u2019s education in a herders family. Herders use village \ncenters to access basic services and necessities including trading of livestocks. \n \n7.  The reliability of electricity supply varies widely across Mongolia and is worst in the \npoorest villages, which are not connected to the grid. Of 314 village centers, only 117 are \nconnected to grid-based electricity supply; the remaining 197 centers operate isolated systems \nwith small diesel generation capacity (60-100 kW) that mostly operate 3-5 hours each day. \nBecause of rough terrain and vast distances between population centers and the volume of \nelectricity consumption due to small population, diesel generation is the most economic source \nof  electricity  for  some  province  centers.  Diesel  needs  to  be  imported,  transported,  and \nstockpiled  at  high  volumes  and  supply  interruptions  can  cause  severe  power  shortages. \nCurrently,  during  summer  months,  operating  hours  for  diesel  generation  are  reduced  to \nminimize the cost of expensive diesel\u201546% of villages provide no service, 40% have only \nevening service, and only 13% provide electricity for full 24 hours. Lack of critical spare parts for \nregular maintenance can increase the frequent interruptions of supply making diesel generation \nextremely unreliable. The same capacity could support more users with efficient appliances. \n \n8.  The Government cannot sustain its current approach for electricity supply to the highly \ndispersed Mongolian population. The urban population receives poor quality electricity while the \nsubstantial rural population has little or none. The Government subsidizes the operation of \nutilities at each province. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided \naid to replace some of the old Russian generators during 1997-1999 in all off-grid provinces, but \nthe combination of high losses and low tariffs means that the authorities do not have enough \n ", "    3 \ncash  to  maintain  the  generators  properly  and  only  limited  emergency  maintenance  is \nundertaken,  which  increases  outages.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s  generous  subsidies,  the \nelectricity supply in the village centers is deteriorating. \n \n9.  ADB TA3 concluded that while large application of renewable sources like wind, solar, \nand  geothermal  is  not  economic  for  power  generation,  small-scale  projects  could  be \nimplemented for isolated rural areas, an alternative that required further investigation. The \nrecommendation emphasized the possible role of renewable energy in strengthening overall \nrural development. \n \n10.  An ADB loan4 for education highlighted key problems in electricity supply for schools and \nkindergartens in remote rural areas. Generation of electricity using diesel is relatively expensive \nand schools cannot maintain a continued supply with their limited resources. Poorly designed \nbuildings, inadequately maintained electrical systems, and use of inefficient electrical appliances \namplify  this  problem.  Renewable  energy  sources\u2014although  they  are  considered  relatively \nexpensive for most areas connected to main electricity grid\u2015could provide cheap electricity \ncomplementing existing diesel generation. ADB\u2019s experience with remote schools suggests that \nlack of capital resources is the reason for low use of alternative electricity sources, such as wind \nand solar despite high prevailing winds and over 300 days of annual sunlight. \n \n11.  Village hospitals provide primary health care services to the rural population that are \ncomparable to family group practices in urban areas. Electricity is typically used for fluorescent \nlamps, television, radio, electric kettles and a refrigerator. Village hospitals are usually equipped \nwith beds as they serve a vast area (some patients may need to travel 200 kilometer (km) to \nreach a hospital). Like schools and kindergartens, lack of a reliable supply of electricity in village \nhospitals undermines their operations. For example, in summer when rural areas receive full \nsummer sun exposure everyday, some village hospitals operate under candlelight at night to \nsave  diesel  fuel.  The  ADB  healthcare  project5  recommended  that  village  hospitals  be \ndownsized, as hospital beds serve social and community purposes more than healthcare and \nthese  hospitals  should  cater  to  the  needs  of  specific  communities  as  health  centers.  The \ndownsizing  of  village  hospitals  will  make  them  more  suitable  for  complementary  hybrid \nrenewable generation. \n \n12.  Wind  and  solar  hybrid  systems  for  rural  hospitals,  schools,  dormitories,  and \ncommunication centers are currently being used in some village centers and isolated initiatives \nare evaluating various options. There are no support facilities for maintenance of existing solar, \nwind, and diesel generation and spare parts are difficult to find. Higher penetration of renewable \nenergy  sources  is  one  way  of  ensuring  that  secondary  industries  will  be  developed  for \nmaintenance. The Government and customers need to physically assess the technology that \nmay be suitable to Mongolia. An integrated strategy should be developed to address these \ntechnical support and capacity building issues, without which the efficiency level will further \ndeteriorate  and  losses  will  gradually  erode  the  industry.  Information  on  successful \nimplementation  of  renewable  energy  generation  needs  to  be  closely  studied  before  the \npossibility of a broader scale application can be addressed. \n \n13.  In  Mongolia  with  its  vast  land,  sparse  population,  and  hundreds  of  isolated  small \nsettlements throughout the country, an off-grid solution is the most economic option to provide \nelectricity in rural areas and isolated small towns. The major problem of the current diesel \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 1991. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Capacity Building in Energy Planning.

Manila.  \n ", "4 \nsystem is the pressure of the recurrent expenditures for operation and maintenance that often \ncause interruptions in power supply. This is also a major concern to ensuring the success of \nADB's poverty reduction intervention in the health, education, and municipal services in rural \nareas and small towns. Given its natural endowment, Mongolia has great potential to benefit \nfrom the appropriate technology in renewable energy. Large scale use of renewable energy will \nrequire policy support, substantive capital investment, skilled labor to operate and maintain, \nregular maintenance, and stable supply of spare parts. These have technical and financial \nimplications, which may be why the country has used only limited renewable energy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The immediate purpose of the TA will be to assist the Government to undertake a \ncomprehensive  assessment\u2015through  policy  study,  technical  review,  and  a  few  pilot \nschemes\u2015of  the  technical  feasibility  and  economic  viability  of  new  renewable  energy \ntechnology  under  Mongolian  circumstances,  as  a  basis  for  decision  making  and  policy \nformulation.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  to  develop  a  renewable  energy  policy  for \nisolated  rural  areas  and  formulate  strategies  for  implementation.  The  strategy  will  identify \noptions for mainstreaming renewable energy to improve access to electricity for poor nomadic \nfamilies.  \n \n15.  The TA will (i) formulate a renewable energy policy and study existing renewable energy \nuse in Mongolia; (ii) finance a renewable energy exhibit in Ulaanbaatar; (iii) develop a campaign \nfor mainstreaming renewable energy in rural areas; (iv) select appropriate technology from the \nexhibit, if possible, and design pilot projects for wind-diesel or solar-diesel hybrid systems\u2015two \nsources of power that complement each other to supply schools and hospitals in village areas; \n(v) implement pilot projects6 and periodically monitor technical performance and reliability of \nhybrid systems for a year; (vi) publish results of monitoring; (vii) analyze options for possible \nprivate sector participation by way of maintenance contracts for maintaining diesel and hybrid \nsystems for the whole region; and (viii) develop leasing options by packaging existing subsidies \nand other sources to develop a single tariff solution for installing hybrid systems in schools and \nhospitals. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will adopt a consultative participatory approach and build on the work of the \nGovernment and other agencies. Key activities will include policy dialogue with the Government, \nthe workshop and exhibition, a media campaign promoting renewable energy, development of a \nmonitoring mechanism for pilot projects, development of options for outsourcing maintenance of \nexisting diesel generation to private companies at fixed cost, formulation of packaged solutions \nfor hybrid systems, and a report and final presentation to government and other stakeholders.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $475,000 equivalent, of which $365,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $110,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$35,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Denmark (see Appendix 2). \n                                                 \n6  Efforts will be taken to reduce the need for pilot study, if possible, to increase the budget for study and training on \nefficient operation of diesel generation. \n ", "    5 \nThe Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost through the provision of \noffice  accommodation,  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  local  transport,  equipment,  and \nsecretarial support.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The  TA  will  require  18  person-months  of  services  from  a  consulting  firm:  8  from \ninternational and 10 from domestic consultants. The consulting firm team will comprise the \nfollowing international and domestic experts: renewable energy economist and Team Leader, \nrenewable  energy  technical  expert,  domestic  renewable  energy  economist,  and  domestic \nrenewable energy technical expert. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used  to  recruit \nconsultants  and  the  quality-and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used  for  consultant \nselection. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  The Department for Fuel and Energy of Ministry of Infrastructure will be the Executing \nAgency. It will assign a project leader and counterpart staff to work with the consultants, and will \nprovide the consultants with adequate office accommodation in Ulaanbaatar, support secretarial \nstaff,  telephone,  photocopying  and  office  services,  and  some  local  costs.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over a period of 18 months to provide a full year of monitoring for the pilot projects. \nIt will start in February 2003 and will be completed in July 2004. The major reports required from \nthe consultants are (i) an inception report describing detail work program (3 weeks after the start \nof the TA); (ii) two reports describing progress of work (after 4 and 8 months); (iii) a draft final \nreport with all deliverables including results from pilot projects as per the terms of reference (16 \nmonths);  and  (iv)  a  final  report,  which  is  the  draft  final  report  after  incorporating  ADB's \ncomments (18 months). \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Denmark for Renewable \nEnergy Development in Small Towns and Rural Areas, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1        \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanism  Assumptions and Risks \nGoals       \n       \nPromote economic development and  Improve adequacy and  Energy institutions\u2019  Government\u2019s ability to \npoverty reduction by satisfying  reliability and of power supply.   annual reports.  provide counterpart \nelectricity demand for remote rural      funding and attract foreign \ncustomers.
