INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Fiji  has  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the development of institutional capacity for regulation of \nFiji\u2019s electricity sector, and for development of a sector investment planning framework.  ADB \nconsulted with government representatives in March 2015 and agreed on the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation, cost, financing, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.1  The proposed TA is included in the country \noperations business plan, 2015\u20132017. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Fiji\u2019s  power  sector  is  dominated  by  the  Fiji  Electricity  Authority  (FEA),  a  statutory \nauthority  established  under  the  provisions  of  the  Electricity  Act  of  1966.  FEA  officers  are \nappointed by the Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources. FEA is the sole entity authorized \nto generate, transmit, distribute, and sell electricity in Fiji, and to license other entities to operate \nin the power sector. \n \n3.  The Government of Fiji has indicated its intention to increase the share of private-sector \nparticipation in the power sector through corporatization and privatization of FEA, and through \nthe attraction of new entrants on a competitive basis in key market segments (in particular \ngeneration). The government expects that this will yield efficiency increases within the sector \nthrough the forces of competition, and accelerate investment in new  assets to meet Fiji\u2019s \ngrowing demand and increase the share of renewable sources in its generation mix. To facilitate \nthese  processes  and  achieve  these  objectives,  developing  a  credible,  modern  and  robust \nregulatory regime for the power sector is essential. \n \n4.  Fiji\u2019s installed capacity is about 263 megawatts, comprising 136 megawatts of renewable \ngeneration  (hydro,  wind,  solar,  and  biomass),  with  the  remainder  consisting  of  fossil  fuel \nplants\u2014diesel  or  heavy  fuel  oil.  Total  power  generation  in  2013  was  approximately  62% \nrenewable, 38% fossil fuel. Fiji\u2019s newly revised sector policy set targets of 67% renewable \ngeneration by 2015, and 99% by 2030.2 To this end, FEA has been pursuing renewable energy \ninvestments,  the  latest  addition  being  the  40-megawatt  Nadarivatu  hydroelectric  plant \ncommissioned  in  2012.  Favorable  rainfall  and  the  addition  of  Nadarivatu  allowed  FEA  to \ngenerate 65% of its output from hydroelectric sources in 2012 (a 15% increase in hydroelectric \ngeneration over 2011). Complemented by a 37% increase in wind power output, diesel and \nheavy fuel oil generation decreased to 42% of total output (21% below 2011). Nevertheless, \nFEA expenditure on diesel and heavy fuel oil totaled over F$105 million in 2012, roughly 48% of \ntotal costs.3 \n \n5.  Most of Fiji\u2019s power generation is owned by FEA. Two independent power producers \ncontractually authorized to sell to FEA account for 2.4% of installed grid-connected capacity in \nFiji (Tropik Wood Industries Limited and Fiji Sugar Corporation, both of which use biomass as \nfuel stock). FEA\u2019s customer base consists largely of residential consumers (91%), commercial \nconsumers (9%), and industrial consumers (<0.1%). Consumption and revenue statistics are \nstrikingly different, with 48% of electricity sales revenue attributed to commercial consumers, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 3 July 2015. \n2 Government of Fiji, Department of Energy. 2013. Fiji National Energy Policy 2013\u20132020, Final Draft. Suva \nNovember. \n3  FEA. 2012. Annual Report.  http://www.fea.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FEA-ANNUAL-REPORT-2012.pdf  \n ", "2  \n26% to industrial consumers, and the remaining 26% to domestic consumers. Fiji\u2019s electricity \npenetration  rate  among  households  is  roughly  90%,  with  a  state  policy  target  of  100% \npenetration by 2020 (footnote 2). Approximately 10% of the population is still without access to \nelectricity and Fiji is struggling to provide remote areas and isolated islands with access to \nelectricity in a sustainable manner. Additional network infrastructure and generation is needed \nto  expand  service  to  these  populations.  Overall,  Fiji\u2019s  electricity  system  needs  significant \ninvestment, estimated to be in the order of $760 million (F$1.5 billion) (footnote 2), over the next \ndecade. \n \n6.   Despite progress in increasing the share of renewable resources in Fiji\u2019s generation mix, \na high reliance on imported fuels remains. Grid-based power supply has arguably the greatest \npotential  to  make  Fiji\u2019s  energy  sector  more  efficient,  cost  effective,  and  environmentally \nsustainable. There are a number of undeveloped but promising hydro sites, and significant \nunexplored geothermal, solar, and wind resources that can reduce Fiji\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel \ngeneration.  \n \n7.   As the sole statutory authority authorized to operate in the power sector, FEA exists \neffectively as a self-regulating entity. Tariffs are approved by the Fiji Commerce Commission, \nbut the manner in which prices are reviewed is not transparent and does not offer the long-term \ncertainty and predictability that private investors would prefer. Tariffs are distorted, and contain \ncross subsidy by industrial and commercial customers (F$0.42/kilowatt-hour [kWh]) in favor of \nresidential  customers  (F$0.33/kWh).  For  domestic  customers,  the first  block  of  75 kWh  is \nsubsidized  at  roughly  50%;  for  commercial  and  industrial  customers,  a  reduced  rate  of \nF$0.40/kWh is applied to the first 14,999 kWh per month, rising to F$0.42 thereafter. \n \n8.   This TA reflects the government\u2019s intentions for sector regulation. In March 2015, ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative presented an analysis of options for the creation of a \nmultisector  regulatory  agency  based  on  existing  regulatory  institutions.  The  government\u2019s \npreference is to consolidate regulatory functions within a single agency, rather than create \nseparate agencies for each regulated industry or network monopoly. The government has not \nyet identified which existing institution might be transformed into such an agency, or whether an \nentirely new agency will be created; nor has it defined what will be the prospective agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  \n \n9.  This TA coincides with the government\u2019s pursuit of partial divestment of FEA. The \nestablishment  of  a  credible  regulatory  regime  for  the  electricity  sector  is  essential  for  the \nmaximization of the transaction\u2019s value, and the stimulation of sector development through \nmobilization  of  private  investment.  A  coherent  investment  planning  framework  is  likewise \nimportant  to  direct  investments  (public  and  private)  in  accordance  with  government  policy \nobjectives. \n \n10.  Government policy objectives include the following:  \n \n(i)  Affordable energy for all. Ensure that all Fijians have access to affordable and \nreliable modern energy services.  \n(ii)  Sustainable energy supplies. Establish environmentally sound and sustainable \nsystems for energy production, procurement, transportation, distribution, and end \nuse.  \n(iii)  Reduced import costs. Encourage the efficient use of energy and the use of \nindigenous energy sources to reduce the financial burden of energy imports on \nFiji.  \n ", "  3\n \n11.  To achieve the objectives, government priority actions include: (i) expand role of the \nprivate sector in grid electricity generation, including the partial privatization of FEA; (ii) promote \nan increase in the contribution of non-FEA renewable energy, in particular from small-scale \nsystems; (iii) restructure regulatory arrangements to improve transparency and accountability \nand  remove  possible  conflicts  of  interest;  and  (iv)  achieve  a  renewable  energy  share  in \nelectricity generation of 99% by 2030. \n \n12.   Technical regulatory functions currently held by FEA, including licensing and approvals, \nwill be transferred to a new multisector regulator. Options for division of essential regulatory \nfunctions will be the subject of analysis to be provided under the proposed TA. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n13.  The TA responds to the Government of Fiji\u2019s request for ADB assistance to develop \nregulatory capacity and sector planning capacity within appropriate agencies. ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Fiji focuses on three interlinked priorities of (i) raising Fiji\u2019s \nlonger-term growth potential, (ii) building resilience and reducing vulnerability, and (iii) reducing \npoverty through more inclusive growth and better service delivery. This TA supports all three of \nthese priorities by promoting greater, more sustainable, and secure energy supply to Fiji\u2019s \npopulation and economy. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the TA will be a resource efficient, cost effective, and environmentally \nsustainable energy sector. The outcome of the TA will be improved framework for development \nof Fiji's energy sector. The TA will improve the environment for private and public investment in \nFiji\u2019s energy sector and promote the expansion of renewable generation and electricity service \nto portions of Fiji\u2019s population that currently do not enjoy formal electricity service. The TA will \nprovide the foundation for a robust and best-practices energy sector regulatory environment as \nit relates to key aspects of economic regulation of public utilities and to sector development \nplanning and investment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The proposed TA has two distinct outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Capacity development at selected regulatory agency. The TA will \nreview existing legal and institutional frameworks governing the energy sector, and will \nproduce  draft  legislation  to  assign  sector  regulation  responsibilities  to  designated \ngovernment agencies. The identification of the government agency or agencies to which \nregulatory authorities and functions will be assigned will be the subject of examination \nunder this component. The TA will also produce recommendations for the recipient \nregulatory agencies\u2019 structures, resources, and personnel, to correspond with assigned \nregulatory responsibilities, and will provide training for selected personnel as described \nbelow; and \n  \n(ii)  Output  2:  Enhanced  sector  planning  capacity  at  relevant  government \ndepartment.    The  TA  will  work  with  the  selected  regulatory  agency  and  relevant \ngovernment department to prepare sector planning and investment project screening \n ", "4  \nmethodologies,  and  will  produce  one  generation  and  one  network  investment  pre-\nfeasibility study under the proposed planning and project screening methodologies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  The Government of \nFiji will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimate and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA with the Pacific Department acting as the \nfocal department. The Ministry of Finance will facilitate provision of all data and information from \npublic and government sources necessary for consultants\u2019 work and facilitate interaction with \nother government and nongovernment Fiji stakeholders. \n \n18.  For the first output, an international consultant will be engaged to analyze and confirm \noptions for development of a multisector regulatory agency on the basis of existing government \nagencies  or  creation  of  a  new  agency;  assess  the  legal  framework  providing  for  sector \nregulation; draft enabling legislation or revisions to existing legislation; define the agency\u2019s \ncapacity development requirements; and develop recommendations for secondary legislation to \nenable the selected agency to begin to discharge its functions. The consultant will also identify \nrequired competencies and skills for the agency\u2019s function and propose the training needed for \npersonnel  to  perform  assigned  regulatory  functions,  prepare  criteria  for  the  selection  of \npersonnel to receive training, assist in selecting candidates for training, and assist in identifying \nappropriate training opportunities to be funded under the TA. The international consultant will be \nsupported by a national consultant with familiarity with the Fiji legislative process and norms of \nlegislative drafting. Consultants will be hired on an individual consultant basis. Level of effort \nand contract period shall be 6 person-months (international) and 10 person-months (national) \nover 12 months (intermittent). \n  \n19.  To support the first output, the TA will provide training for identified multisector regulatory \nagency and other government personnel in recognized professional training programs to be \nproposed by the consultant and confirmed by ADB. ADB will collaborate with consultants and \nthe  executing  agency  to  identify  training  providers. Training  programs  will  be  off-the-shelf, \nresident short-term programs of approximately 2 weeks\u2019 duration.4 \n \n20.  For the second output, ADB will hire and manage a consulting firm to deliver detailed \nrecommendations  for  establishing  the  underlying  policy  framework  for  the  identification, \nprioritization,  selection,  and  implementation  of  discrete  renewable  generation  and  service \nexpansion  investments,  and  to  develop  sector  planning  capacity  and  project  screening \nmethodologies within the regulatory agency and relevant government department, including the \npreparation of a geospatial inventory of existing power sector assets, infrastructures, renewable \nenergy resources, and population centers of all permanently inhabited islands. The consulting \nfirm will be hired under the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a ratio of 90:10 in \nfavor of quality. \n \n                                                \n4  Courses      such      as    those    offered      by    the    World    Bank    Public      Utility    Research    Center \n(http://warrington.ufl.edu/centers/purc/training/itp.asp)  or  the  Institute  for  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships \n(http://www.ip3.org/ip3_site/index.php/courses/regulation-courses) are suggested for consideration. \n ", "  5\n21.  Indicative  key  personnel  positions  for  the  second  output  include:  (i)  geographic \ninformation systems expert (2 person-months); legal and regulatory expert (3 person-months); \nrenewable  energy  generation  expert(s)  (solar,  wind,  or  hydro,  to  be  confirmed;  4  person-\nmonths); transmission and/or distribution electrical engineer (4 person-months); project finance \nexpert  and  economist  (4  person  months);  private  sector  investment  and  public\u2013private \npartnership advisor (4 person-months); environmental safeguards expert (2 person-months); \nand  social  and  poverty  expert  (2  person-months).    Contract  period  will  be  18  months \n(intermittent).5 \n \n22.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursement will follow direct payment \nprocedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for consultants appear in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from approval to completion.  ADB will field \nan  inception  mission,  regular  review  missions,  a  midterm  review  mission,  and  finalization \nmission.  ADB will liaise closely with government counterparts and attend meetings between \nconsultants  and  counterparts,  including  presentation  of  results  and  outputs.  ADB  and  the \nMinistry of Finance will closely monitor progress against schedules agreed at inception, and will \nevaluate consultants\u2019 fulfilment of agreed terms of reference and deliverables requirements. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe Government of Fiji for Support for Energy Sector Regulatory Capacity and Electrification \nInvestment Planning, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                \n5 Level of effort is indicative.
