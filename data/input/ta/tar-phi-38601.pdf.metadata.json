The Government of the Republic of the Philippines  has requested technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support its ongoing efforts to strengthen the \ncountry's anti-money laundering (AML) regime.1  The scope and design of the TA draw upon the \nGovernment's request at the 2004 annual meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group  (APG) on money \nlaundering2 as well as subsequent discussions with key stakeholders\u2014notably the Anti-Money \nLaundering Council (AMLC)3 and development partners active in this area.  A mission fielded in \nFebruary 2005 reached an understanding with the Government on the goal, purpose, scope, \nimplementation, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Philippines is currently in the process of strengthening implementation of its AML \nregime.  With support from TA 3847-PHI4 and other development partners,5 key elements of an \nAML regime are now in place with the establishment of a functional financial intelligence unit \n(FIU) and strengthened legal, regulatory, and interinstitutional frameworks.  Significant capacity-\nbuilding  support  has  also  been  provided  across  a  range  of  key  AML-related  institutions. \nAppendix  1  gives  a  summary  of  recent  ADB  support  in  this  area.    In  recognition  of  the \nsubstantial progress achieved in establishing its AML regime, the Philippines was removed from \nthe Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) list of noncooperative countries and territories (NCCT) \nin February 2005.6 \n \n3.  Sustained effective implementation of the AML regime, however, is now required (and is \nthe  focus  of  this  TA).    That  is  essential  to  support  the  Government's  efforts  to  address \nfundamental and chronic governance and security issues that are retarding economic growth, \nas well as to demonstrate continued commitment and progress during the probationary period \nfollowing the country's removal from the NCCT list. \n \n4.  A well-functioning AML regime involves the effective discharge of responsibilities by a \nwide  range  of  parties\u2014e.g.,  reporting  of  covered  and  suspicious  transaction7  by  covered \ninstitutions monitoring and analysis of transaction reports and related information by the FIU, \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 October 2004. \n2 APG is a regional body concerned with money laundering issues. It complements the role of FATF (FATF, footnote \n6) by facilitating more focused monitoring along with support of countries' efforts to establish and strengthen their \nAML regimes.  \n3 AMLC is the lead monitoring and investigative agency in this area (i.e. the financial intelligence unit).  It is a tripartite \nbody composed of the Central Bank governor, the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, and the Insurance \ncommissioner.  By composition, AMLC serves as a natural and effective mechanism for coordination in this area.  \n4 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering \nRegime.  Manila. \n5 Notably the United States Agency for International Development, with whom there has been close and ongoing \ncoordination. \n6 FATF is the principal international body concerned with money laundering issues.  It began the process of \nidentifying jurisdictions with serious deficiencies in their anti-money laundering regime in 1999.  The Philippines \nwas placed on FATF's NCCT list in June 2000 as a result of this exercise and was removed from the list in \nFebruary 2005.  Delisting carries with it a 1-year probationary period during which significant progress on \nimplementation is expected and will be closely monitored.  FATF has noted a particular need to focus on (i) \nstrengthening effectiveness of supervisory authorities, (ii) improving investigative tools and techniques used by law \nenforcement and AMLC, (iii) achieving progress on outcomes for AML-related cases currently before the courts, \nand (iv) strengthening identification and reporting of suspicious transactions by banks and other relevant parties. \n7 See glossary for definitions of covered and suspicious transactions.  Identification and reporting of suspicious \ntransactions do not depend on exceeding a value threshold but rather on effective procedures in covered \ninstitutions (see glossary) and appropriate training, judgment, and compliance of staff (paras. 6 and 7). \n ", "2   \ninvestigation and prosecution by law enforcement agencies, and adjudication of cases by the \ncourts.  Appropriate coordination and cooperation among parties are likewise crucial to effective \nimplementation of the regime.   \n \n5.  The Philippines has made significant progress in some aspects of implementation\u2014\nnotably, in the reporting of covered transactions by covered institutions8\u2014but bottlenecks and \nobstacles persist, as is suggested by the lack of convictions to date on AML-related cases.  For \noverall implementation to be effective, it is crucial that issues are identified and addressed in a \nsystematic rather than piecemeal fashion.    \n \n6.  There  are  areas  where  effective  addressing  of  issues  can  broadly  support  overall \nimplementation or where the need for demonstrable progress is pressing.  In particular, FATF \nconsiders the level of suspicious transactions reports (STRs) filed by covered institutions to be \nlow9 and has noted the need to strengthen compliance.   \n \n7.  Weak compliance appears to be due in part to perceived competitiveness and cost \nconcerns on the part of covered institutions, job and personal security concerns10 on the part of \nstaff, and an assumption of weak enforcement by supervisory bodies.  Enforcement, in turn, is \nweak in part because of inadequate protection for supervisors from lawsuits by affected parties, \nas well as resource and capacity constraints.11 Incentives, procedures, and capacity of covered \ninstitutions as well as supervisory bodies will need to be strengthened if compliance with \nsuspicious transaction reporting requirements is to improve. \n \n8.  While a basic legal and regulatory framework to address money laundering is now in \nplace with the passage of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA), amending legislation, and \nimplementing rules and regulations,12 there is a need to further strengthen AMLA13 as well as \ndevelop  complementary  legislation  and  regulation  in  key  areas  to  support  effective \nimplementation.  Among others, civil forfeiture rules must be developed to allow for timely and \neffective penalization of criminal activity, as processing of cases through the court system is \ncurrently lengthy as well as unpredictable. \n \n9.  Effective  discharge  of  AML-related  responsibilities  by  implementing  institutions  also \nclearly depends on adequate availability of appropriately trained staff.  In this regard, there is \nneed to develop locally-based training programs that allow for sustainable and cost-effective \ncapacity building in general as well as specialized (e.g., forensic accounting) AML-related skills. \n \n10.  Finally, money laundering as well as the underlying predicate crime is often cross-border \nin  scope  (e.g.,  drug  trafficking)  and  has  a  strong  regional  dimension.    Addressing  them \neffectively will require close cooperation between the Philippines and other jurisdictions.  The \ndevelopment of strong working relationships and sharing of experience and expertise as well as \n                                                 \n8 As of 31 December 2004, 22,701,905 covered transactions had been reported, and AMLC had established a \nsystem that can effectively receive and store such transactions to allow further analysis. \n9  As of 31 December 2004, 904 suspicious transaction reports had been filed with AMLC by covered institutions. \n10  For example, here is a lack of effective whistleblower protection for parties originating STRs. \n11  Weak enforcement by financial sector supervisory bodies is a general issue and not specific to AML regulation. \n12  Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9160 otherwise known as the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001 was signed into law on \n29 September 2001.  On 7 March 2003, R.A. No. 9194 (An Act Amending R.A. No. 9160) was signed into law. \n13  For  example,  to  increase  the  scope  of  institutions  covered  under  the  law  in  line  with  the  revised  FATF \nrecommendations, which now extend to key nonfinancial businesses and professions such as casinos, real estate \nagents, dealers in precious metals and stones, lawyers, notaries, and other legal professionals, and accountants. \n \n ", "  3\noperational intelligence between relevant authorities across jurisdictional boundaries are crucial \nto facilitating this goal. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA is intended to deter money laundering and predicate crimes through support for \nstrengthening the institutional framework for AML.  The TA framework is in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The major outputs expected from the TA are \n \n(i)  a process map that systematically identifies (a) key money laundering-related \nvulnerabilities in the Philippines and the extent to which they are addressed by \nthe  current  AML  regime,  and  (b)  bottlenecks  and  obstacles  to  effective \nimplementation;  the  process  map  will  be  regime-wide  in  scope  (i.e.,  from \ntransaction reporting through to judicial enforcement) and is intended to provide a \ncomprehensive and common frame of reference for the Government as well as \ninterested development partners to allow for a more systematic and coordinated \napproach to implementation issues; \n(ii)  a strategy and monitorable implementation plan for strengthening compliance \nwith suspicious transactions reporting requirements; \n(iii)  strengthened legal and regulatory framework for AML including development of \ncomplementary legislation and regulation and related technical seminars for key \nconstituencies including legislators, legislative staff, and the judiciary; \n(iv)  locally-based training programs and computer-based training materials to allow \nfor sustainable, cost-effective capacity building;14 and \n(v)  strengthened relationships between Philippine AML authorities and counterparts \nin selected other jurisdictions in the region. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The process map will draw upon an initial desk review of relevant money-laundering \ntypology reports and AML-related country and sector assessments followed by consultations \nwith relevant stakeholders.  Where possible, the process map will identify and make use of \nindicators that allow for objective assessment of the extent of vulnerabilities and bottlenecks as \nwell  as  monitoring  of  progress  in  addressing  them.    In  this  regard,  use  of  cross-country \ncomparisons and reference to international good practice will be made where possible.  To \nensure  consistency  of  findings  with  local  circumstances  and  facilitate  ownership  by \nstakeholders, the process mapping exercise will be led by domestic experts, who will work in \nclose consultation with AMLC, ADB staff, and other experts as appropriate. \n \n14.  The  compliance  strategy  for  suspicious  transaction  reporting  will  cover  supervisory \nauthorities as well as covered institutions and will build on an initial assessment of issues.  The \nassessment will draw upon consultations with relevant stakeholders to identify weaknesses in \ninstitutional  capacity,  procedures,  and  the  incentive  framework  for  suspicious  transaction \nreporting.  The subsequent strategy will offer a coherent package of short-, medium-, and \n                                                 \n14 Training programs under TA 3847-PHI (footnote 4) addressed the need to quickly build basic capacity in relevant \ninstitutions to allow for timely implementation of the then recently passed law (details in Appendix 1).  The present \nTA builds on that base by providing for increased depth and scope in coverage and emphasizing cost-effectiveness \nand sustainability through greater use of computer-based training and local training institutions. \n ", "4   \nlonger-term  measures  to  address  issues  identified.    Where  appropriate,  it  will  draw  upon \neffective  approaches  in  other  jurisdictions  in  addressing  similar  issues\u2014while  taking  into \naccount  local  institutional  constraints.    The  strategy  will  include  an  implementation  plan, \ndeveloped in close consultation with stakeholders, which makes use of relevant milestones and \nindicators  to  track  changes  in  institutional  capacity,  procedural  efficacy,  and  incentive \nframework. \n \n15.  Support for strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for AML will draw upon the \nfindings of the process map to identify implementation issues that would require or benefit from \nchanges  in  the  framework.    Particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  development  of  rules  that \nstrengthen institutional or individual incentives for AML implementation or allow for alternative \nmeans  to  address  otherwise  thorny  implementation  issues  requiring  systemic  long-term \nsolutions.15  In close consultation with AMLC and other relevant stakeholders, experts under the \nTA will identify key areas where changes to the legal and regulatory framework would be \nbeneficial as well as politically feasible and provide related support. \n \n16.  Development and provision of locally based AML-related training programs will be done \nin close collaboration with relevant local institutions.  Subjects will focus on key areas such as \nforensic  accounting  where  expertise  is  widely  needed  but  local  training  capacity  does  not \ncurrently exist.  Particular attention will be paid to designing courses that are accessible to \ntarget audiences in terms of time and cost and tightly focused on operationally relevant content.  \nWhere appropriate, support will also be provided to facilitate integration of subject matter into \nmainstream curricula.  Experts will work with relevant authorities and professional bodies to \nfacilitate development of standards for course accreditation and professional certification.  To \nfacilitate future course development, establishment of linkages between local training institutions \nand appropriate foreign counterparts will be supported.  \n \n17.  Development and provision of AML-related computer-based training materials will be \ndone in close collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which \nhas developed a set of 13 computer-based training modules focused on AML-related topics.  \nThe modules provide for well-designed and targeted training that is individually monitorable, \ncost-effective, and user-oriented in terms of pace and scheduling.  Experts under the TA will \nprovide technical content and work with UNODC to develop additional modules to widen the \nscope of the existing package in line with local needs.  The modules and related software and \nmaterials will be provided to AMLC and will be made available to its staff and well as staff of \nother relevant institutions.  There will be support for installing the modules and training the staff \non use and maintenance. \n \n18.  Strengthening  working  relationships  between  the  Philippines\u2019  AML  authorities  and \ncounterparts in selected other jurisdictions in the region will be facilitated through support for \ndevelopment of twinning arrangements and may include on-site visits and, where appropriate \nand feasible, secondment of selected staff. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $575,000  equivalent,  comprising  $293,000  in  foreign \nexchange and $282,000 equivalent in local currency.  The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance $400,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $107,000 equivalent of local \n                                                 \n15 For example, for timely and effective penalization of criminal activity, civil forfeiture rules provide an alternative to \nreliance on processing of criminal cases through the court system. \n ", "  5\ncurrency costs.  The TA will be provided on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for Regional \nTrade and Financial Security Initiative and administered by ADB.  The Government will provide \nfacilities  and  counterpart  support  valued  at  $175,000  equivalent.    The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  AMLC will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  Implementing Agencies will include the \nCentral Bank, Securities and Exchange Commission, Insurance Commission, Department of \nJustice, and the Supreme Court as well as other relevant courts.  The TA will be implemented \nover 12 months and is expected to start in July 2005 and be completed by June 2006.  \n \n21.  The  TA  will  require  an  estimated  20  person-months  of  consulting  services:  8 \ninternational  and  12  domestic.    International  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  (i)  a \ncompliance expert, (ii) a regulatory expert, and (iii) a forensic accounting/training development \nexpert.  Domestic consulting services will be provided by (i) a project coordinator/regulatory \nexpert,  (ii)  a  senior  advisor  (process  mapping),  (iii)  a  process-mapping  expert,  and  (iv)  a \ncompliance expert.  The project coordinator/regulatory expert will be responsible for identifying \nand recruiting (in consultation with other relevant experts and with ADB concurrence) additional \nresource persons, as needed, for implementing training programs with specialized content.  \nConsultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.  All consultants will submit an \ninception report detailing a draft work plan and schedule within 1 week of fielding and submit to \nAMLC and ADB concise, regular updates outlining progress and identifying implementation \nissues.    The  project  coordinator  will  prepare  and  submit  to  AMLC  and  ADB  consolidated \nmidterm, draft final, and final reports based on individual consultant reports and consultations, \nas necessary, according to a schedule agreed to with AMLC and ADB. \n \n22.  UNODC will install the set of AML-related computer-based modules in a training facility \nadministered by the AMLC secretariat and provide training on its use and maintenance.  For \nsupport in producing additional modules, ADB will directly select the firm that produced the the \nexisiting set of modules to take advantage of extensive specialized experience and skills and \nallow for effective integration with existing software.  All services, equipment, and material to \nsupport implementation of the TA will be procured by direct purchase in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on Procurement. \n \n23.  AMLC will disseminate relevant TA outputs though its web site.  The process map will \nalso be published in print form and provided directly to relevant stakeholders and interested \ndevelopment partners.  Relevant TA outputs will be provided to APG to facilitate regional \ndissemination. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for Regional Trade \nand Financial Security Initiative for Strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering Regime (Phase \nII), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY OF RECENT AND ONGOING ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANTI-MONEY \nLAUNDERING-RELATED SUPPORT TO THE PHILIPPINES \n \nTA 3847-PHI: Strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering Regime ($1 million; 2002) \nLoan 2003-PHI: Second Nonbank Financial Sector Governance Program ($150 million; 2003) \n \nA.

The technical assistance (TA) has supported the establishment and development of key \nelements  necessary  for  an  effective  anti-money  laundering  regime,  including  a  functional \nfinancial intelligence unit (FIU) and strengthened legal and interinstitutional frameworks.  Key \noutputs include the following: \n(i)  development of an anti-money laundering (AML) implementation strategy and a \ncorresponding timebound plan; \n(ii)  development of a common compliance policy that provides for transparent and, \nwhere feasible, consistent AML compliance procedures and penalties across \nfinancial sector supervisors; \n(iii)  design and development of a transaction monitoring system for the FIU; and \n(iv)  extensive legal advice on areas that require legislative reform. \n \n2.  Substantial capacity-building support has also been provided across a range of AML-\nrelated institutions.  Training has been based on a detailed needs assessment and covers the \nfollowing areas to date: \n(i)  general AML awareness \n(ii)  compliance for \n(a)  staff of financial institutions \n(b)  staff of supervisory authorities \n(c)  senior managers in supervisory authorities \n(iii)  investigation techniques \n(iv)  financial investigation \n(v)  training for prosecutors and legal personnel (includes development of a \nprosecutors\u2019 manual) \n(vi)  training for judges (includes development of an AML benchbook/resource \nmaterial) \n(vii)  civil forfeiture \n \n3.  Training has been complemented by support for on-site visits to Malaysia and Australia \nto familiarize key Philippines officials with operational aspects of functional AML regimes, and \nfor the development of working relationships with counterpart institutions in these jurisdictions. \n \n4.
