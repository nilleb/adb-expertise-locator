In December 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Northern Economic Corridor Project1 along National Route 3 in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR). The Government of the Lao PDR, through the Louang Namtha \nprovincial  government,  recognizes  the  positive  opportunities  and  also  potential  negative \nconsequences  of  Route  3  upgrading.    The  provincial  government  therefore  requested \nassistance through ADB to initiate sustainable approaches for reducing poverty and to introduce \nproactive  measures  to  enable  affected  communities  to  partake  of  the  potential  economic \nadvantages resulting from Route 3 upgrading, while shielding them from the potentially adverse \nimpacts of rapid modernization made possible by the road improvements.  The upper Nam Ha \nsubcatchment was proposed as a representative venue for pilot interventions that would pave \nthe way for eventual upscaling along the Route 3 corridor.2  The pilot interventions would focus \non  nine  impoverished  rural  communities  in  the  upper  Nam  Ha  subcatchment  that  were \npreviously the most isolated along the whole of Route 3.  \n \n2.    At the request of the provincial government, a pilot project proposal was prepared for the \ndevelopment of sustainable livelihoods for the nine target villages. Because of cost and scope \nlimitation  of  various  grants,  it  has  been  necessary  to  seek  parallel  financing  for  various \ncomponents of the Nam Ha project. During consultations and a Fact-Finding Mission in May and \nJune 2004, agreement was reached on the preparation of proposals for three discrete stand-\nalone projects with separate sources of funding, including this one for the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund (PRF).3 The Government confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) \nfor this PRF project during ADB\u2019s 2004 Country Programming Mission. The Project has been \nincluded in the Lao PDR Country Strategy and Program Update for 2004.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The upper Nam Ha Subcatchment is a geographic area of 250 square kilometer (km2), \nlocated mostly in northern Viengphukha district with a part in Namtha district, through which a \n35 km segment of Route 3 passes.  The area encompasses the territories of nine ethnic \nminority villages, with eight of the villages located on the roadside and the remaining village \naccessible  only  via  a  steep  narrow  seasonal  feeder  road.  An  85  km2  section  of  the \nsubcatchment is located within the ecologically highly important and environmentally sensitive \nNam Ha National Protected Area (NPA).  The total population of 3,250 is ethnically diverse and \nis growing at an average annual rate of 2.8%. Socioeconomic and livelihood analysis surveys \nreveal that these villages suffer poverty incidence rates of 85-98%, with six of the nine villages \nexperiencing rice deficits and virtually none having a level of income adequate for savings or for \nensuring coverage of family medical or education costs.  The high level of poverty is primarily \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for the Proposed Loan to the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the GMS Northern Economic Corridor Project. Manila.  \n2  The smallest geographical unit (or area) in which it is possible to achieve realistically a sustainable alternative \napproach to traditional shifting agricultural practices within this fragile ecosystem is a subcatchment area and not a \ncommune or village. Normally several villages located in one subcatchment area are ecologically linked to one \nanother, and targeting the pilot activities in only a few villages, while excluding other villages located in the same \nsubcatchment area, would dramatically compromise the overall sustainability of the subcatchment area and the \nwhole pilot, since the villages outside of the pilot activities would continue their traditional agricultural practices \nthereby destabilizing the ecosystem. Destabilization would affect the neighboring villages and be counterproductive \nto the intended objectives of the proposal of the PRF. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 August 2004. \n4  The name of the project in the Country Strategy and Program Update is Poverty Reduction through Development \nof Sustainable Land Use Systems in the Nam Ha Watershed.  The name has since been changed to the present \ntitle. ", "2 \ndue  to  the  declining  productivity  of  their  traditional  livelihood  of  slash-and-burn  shifting \ncultivation (swidden agriculture), resulting from shortened fallow periods, declining hunting and \nfishing yields, and low nontimber forest product (NTFP) in the face of growing local population \npressure and outsider demand. The majority suffer from one or more of the maladies that \ncommonly affect traditional agricultural communities in watersheds throughout Southeast Asian \nas they experience growing population and aspiration pressures. These maladies include (i) \npervasive poverty due to food and income insecurity; (ii) high birth rate, high infant mortality, \nand low life expectancy; (iii) low labor productivity due to poor health; (iv) soil and watershed \ndegradation due to deforestation and erosion; (v) ecological degradation due to overexploitative \nhunting and gathering and uncontrolled burning; and (vi) abuse, production, and trading of \nnarcotic substances for medication and income augmentation. Women and families headed by \nwomen are particularly disadvantaged due to low levels or lack of education, nonassertion of \nlegal rights to landownership, and the high component of female labor for swidden cultivation, \nparticularly for weeding. Many of the youth and young adults have not had the opportunity for \nbasic formal education.  As a result, they have poor fluency and literacy in the Lao language \nand lack numeracy skills, with ethnic minority women and girls being particularly disadvantaged.  \n \n4.   Population pressures will be further accelerated by the improvement of Route 3, which \nwill unavoidably encourage unplanned in-migration of opportunistic entrepreneurs in the area, \nand put more pressure on the scarce resources and the fragile ecosystem. Since 1997, the \nLand Law has provided the primary legal basis for the Land-Forest Allocation Program. This \nprogram was originally conceived as a way of preventing illegal logging by provincial and district \nentrepreneurs  by  giving  villagers  ownership  of  forest  resources  through  a  process  of \nparticipatory land use planning. The land-forest allocation is premised on the lowland notion that \npermanent agriculture comprises only paddy cultivation, gardens, orchards and plantations, \nwhich are classified as permanent and land title is automatically given, providing it can be \nverified by local authorities. Swidden agriculture, on the other hand, is considered impermanent \nand is therefore the target of the national goal to reduce shifting cultivation. \n \n5.  The  provision  of  nonformal  education,  and  health  services,  and  awareness  of \nparticipatory wildlife management have already been piloted successfully in Louang Namtha \nProvince in previous projects involving nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and as such do \nnot require further piloting in the province. What is required instead is their incorporation into an \nintegrated approach to overall poverty reduction. Land allocation to families based on livelihood \nplanning and capability assessment has been piloted in the Theun Hinboun Hydropower Project \nand would be utilized as a reference venue for incorporation into the Nam Ha subcatchment. \nThe entire pilot could be considered as a pilot for upscaling along the length of Route 3 and its \naffected districts. \n \n6.    The objectives of the PRF proposal, as elaborated in the following sections, are in \naccord with (i) the Government\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES \nJanuary 2004), which focuses on the main sectors of agriculture/forestry, education, health and \ntransport (especially road infrastructure), with cross-sectoral priorities including environment, \ngender,  population  and  capacity  building;  and  national  poverty-related  priority  programs \nincluding drug control and human immunodeficiency virus/acute immunodeficiency syndrome \n(HIV/AIDS); (ii) the Government\u2019s Strategic Vision for the Agricultural Sector (1999); and (iii) \nregulations and conventions for management of NPAs and wildlife. The PRF funding would also \nsupport  the  Northern  Region  Development  Strategy  (NRDS),  including  (i)  environmental \ndevelopment strategies for capacity building and human resource development, conservation of \nthe natural environment for stabilizing shifting cultivation through province-level land use zoning, \nparticipatory village-level land use zoning, agricultural intensification, land allocation; (ii) the ", "3 \nhuman  resource  development  strategy  for  education  and  health;  and  (iii)  the  gender  and \ndevelopment  strategy  through  improvements  in  nonformal  education,  family  planning  and \nreproductive health, and gender-equitable land allocation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.    The overall goal is socially, economically, environmentally and ecologically sustainable \npoverty reduction in the nine villages within one subcatchment area in Louang Namtha Province \nof the Lao PDR. The purpose of the TA is for nine typical poor rural ethnic minority communities \nto be socially prepared with secure land tenure and basic health and education and able to \nmanage their natural resources and respond to the opportunities and challenges brought about \nby improvements to Route 3. The outputs will consist of the following: (i) socially prepared \nvillagers; (ii) land capability assessed, land use planned and allocated; (iii) natural resources \nsustainably managed; (iv) enhanced government capacity; and (v) dissemination of lessons \nlearned. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  provincial  authorities  requested  the  collaboration  of  the  Adventist  Development \nRelief Agency in the Lao PDR (ADRA Lao) for the formulation of the pilot proposal.  After \nextensive field investigation over a 3-year period, and consultation with and participation of the \ntarget  villages  and  various  Government  departments,  ADRA  designed  the  integrated  rural \ndevelopment project for the Nam Ha subcatchment.  ADB wishes to draw on ADRA Lao to \nassist the provincial government to implement the project. The project activities will focus on \npreparing the target communities to enable them to respond to the opportunities and challenges \nbrought about by improvements to Route 3 in the areas of land allocation and certification, and \ncommunity-based  natural  resource  management  and  conservation.  In  addition,  the  TA  will \nassist in expanding visionary planning to the whole of Viengphukha District as a step toward \nultimate  province-wide  planning.  The  Project  will  consist  of  five  components:  (i)  social \npreparation;  (ii)  land  capability  assessment,  land  use  planning  and  allocation;  (iii)  natural \nresource management; (iv) capacity building for the local government; and (v) dissemination of \nlessons learned. Gender analysis will be conducted and a gender action plan will be prepared \nduring the inception phase of the Project. \n \n9.  Component 1 will (i) establish and strengthen village institutions, (ii) provide nonformal \neducation for adolescents (with emphasis on girls) and adults who have not had access to \nformal  education,  thereby  opening  up  the  possibility  for  them  to  engage  in  development \nactivities and enterprise opportunities to a much greater degree: basic literacy, numeracy, and \nLao language fluency training built around a curriculum that includes the key health, business, \nmicroenterprise,  marketing,  conservation,  agricultural  and  forestry  messages,  thereby \nreinforcing and strengthening the development process; (iii) work with district and provincial \nhealth services to upgrade community health systems, including family planning, birth spacing, \nsafe motherhood, disease prevention, and building the capacity of the village-based health \nworkers to have a healthy, productive, and stable population; and (iv) provide training in basic \nbusiness  skills,  rice  and  cattle  bank  systems  and  bookkeeping  skills,  local  product \nprocessing/value adding; and seed money and training for establishing revolving funds, in \ncollaboration with other in-country ADB microfinance initiatives. \n \n10.  Component 2 will consist of (i) land capability assessment for Viengphukha District; (ii) \nconsultative  land  use  planning  and  land  allocation  for  the  nine  target  villages,  including ", "4 \npreparation of village land use and resource use regulations; (iii) protection of women\u2019s rights to \nland by ensuring equal participation in land allocation and the titling process, issuance of land \ntitles in the names of both husband and wife, and full understanding of their rights; and (iv) \neducation of villagers and provincial government staff regarding the application of the Land Law, \nthe Forestry Law and relevant local subordinate legislation, and rights to claiming land titles. \n \n11.  Component 3 will support management of wildlife and NTFP harvesting and watershed \nplanning and training, which are important for sustainable resource use by communities. The \nactivities will include training and installing local residents to act as fire wardens, game wardens, \nand ecotourism guides and caterers; and support the participatory development of local natural \nresource use regulations that contribute to sustainable resource use. \n \n12.  Component 4 will provide support and on-the-job training for local government staff in \nthe areas of nonformal education and basic health service delivery, map-based land capability \nassessment, zoning, allocation, and certification, and natural resource management. \n \n13.  Component  5  will  consist  of  dissemination  of  lessons  learned  and  preparation  of \nprocedural manuals for appropriate technologies. \n \n14.  A  separate  complementary  proposal  for  $1.5  million  has  been  submitted  for  grant \nfinancing from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction that would focus on development of \nproject lands and establishment of sustainable land use systems for the subcatchment area. \nADRA Germany has also expressed willingness to provide $39,000 to support a parallel project \nof income-generating activities of (i) fruit orchard development, (ii) NTFP domestication, and (iii) \nlivestock husbandry and aquaculture. A summary description of these complementary projects \nis presented in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,023,300 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $659,300 and the local currency cost is $364,000 equivalent. The entire \nforeign exchange cost and $190,700 equivalent of the local currency cost will be financed on a \ngrant basis from the PRF to be administered by ADB.5  The Government will finance in kind \n$160,000 equivalent, while the remaining $13,300 equivalent will be financed by the community \nthrough labor contribution. The detailed cost estimates and proposed financing arrangements \nare in Appendix 3. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Procurement will be done jointly by the chief technical advisor (CTA) and the \nnational project director (NPD) of the project implementation unit (PIU). Goods and related \nservices  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Goods and related services below $100,000 will be procured using ADB's direct \npurchase  procedure.  Goods  and  services  above  $100,000  will  be  procured  using  ADB's \ninternational shopping procedure.  \n \n                                                 \n5  The TA funds will be supplemented by $0.39 million on a grant basis from the United Nations World Food \nProgramme (UNWFP) to provide rice as food for work for families participating in the project activities. The UNWFP \nassistance will be provided on a parallel basis directly to the project implementation unit (PIU) and will not be \nadministered by ADB. ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Louang Namtha provincial government will be the Executing Agency for the Project, \nand will establish a PIU in Louang Namtha, made up of a qualified NPD, appointed by the \nprovincial governor, and a technical support team headed by the CTA, with counterparts from \nthe  provincial  and  district  governments.  A  project  coordination  committee,  chaired  by  the \nprovincial  vice-governor,  will  provide  overall  implementation  guidance,  approve  overall  and \nannual work and financial plans, and monitor implementation progress. Procurement will be \ndone by the PIU. Since the Project is multisectoral, it will be anchored at the national level with \nthe Department of International Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs acting as coordinating \nbody  with  the  relevant  technical  line  ministries.  The  organization  structure  is  attached  as \nAppendix 4. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months beginning in January 2005 and will require \nthe services of one international consultant for 36 person-months as CTA with expertise in a \nrural development-related field, and 312 person-months of domestic consultants with expertise \nin  community  organizing,  cadastral  surveying,  wildlife  conservation,  health  and  education, \nmicrofinance, product processing, and marketing. ADB will recruit, through direct selection, the \ninternational NGO ADRA Lao,6 which, at the request of the provincial government, designed the \nfull  Nam  Ha  subcatchment  project  before  it  was  submitted  to  ADB  for  consideration  for \nfinancing, and at the request of ADB prepared the proposals for the three complementary \nprojects for parallel financing, including this PRF proposal. ADRA has established a close \nworking  relationship  with  and  has  gained  the  trust  of  the  province,  district,  and  target \ncommunities  and  is  best-placed  to  implement  this  project  effectively.  Because  of  ADRA\u2019s \nintimate  knowledge  about  the  design,  they  will  not  require  any  learning  curve  and  can \ncommence  their  consultancy  immediately  and  efficiently,  with  less  consultants\u2019  time  and \nreduced cost. ADRA will subcontract the services of two technical service contracts to the two \nagencies that assisted it to design the project over the past 3 years: (i) EcoLao to undertake the \nland capability assessment in Viengphukha District, and (ii) Wildlife Conservation Society to \nconduct wildlife conservation training and action research.7 The consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.8 \n \n18.  The Project will work through representative village development committees as the \nprimary  interface  between  the  PIU  and  the  communities  in  participatory  and  collaborative \ndecision making. As a nonvoting member of the project coordination committee, ADB will also \nmonitor and provide guidance through frequent supervision missions. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 5.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 to the Government \nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund for the Poverty Reduction through Land Tenure Consolidation, \nParticipatory Natural Resources Management, and Local Communities Skills Building Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n6  ADRA is an international rural development NGO based in the Lao PDR with the broad-based capabilities of \nmanagerial, technical, and administration experience with similar projects in the Lao PDR since 1994. ADRA has \nbeen operating in the Lao PDR since 1991 and in Louang Namtha Province since 1994.   \n7  EcoLao is experienced with land capability assessment in the Lao PDR, and the Wildlife Conservation Society is \nexperienced in wildlife conservation training and action research in the project area. \n8  Direct selection is justified as per clause 6.13.

Rationale for the Interventions  \n1.  The Northern Areas Development Stategy has identified  forestry as the main economic \nfocus for the rural areas of northern Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR). Before forestland \nareas can be released from shifting cultivation in preparation for wide-scale forest investment \n(i.e., eventual integrated program upscaling), it will be necessary to invest in the rehabilitation of \nthe entire livelihood regime of the ethnic minorities (subsistence rice plus cash crops, plus \nlivestock husbandry + orchards). Most of the past rural development interventions in the region \nhave  been  piecemeal  and  thus  have  not  resulted  in  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  This \nintegrated program therefore takes a holistic approach to sustainable livelihood enhancement \nwith sufficient investment per family to ensure that sedentary agriculture releases sloping lands \nfor forestry. The attactive prospects of favorable economic returns in the long term from forestry \nshould be evident from a review of the proposals for the complementary projects. Operationally, \nit would have been preferable to have funded this program under one combined project, but \ngrant funding terms and conditions have necessitated a split-funding approach.  \n \n2.  To lift rural families, currently practicing shifting cultivation, out of poverty, enable them \nto partake of opportunities for and protect them from key negative consequences of road \nupgrading, the best option is to make agriculture sedentary under intensive yet sustainable \npermanent  land  use  systems.  Sedentary  agriculture  will  significantly  improve  family  farm \nproductivity and pave the way for official land occupancy certification and, hence, secure land \ntenure. Bush fallows, previously required for agricultural usufruct under the shifting cultivation \nregime, will be released for regeneration of forest, part of whose proceeds can augment farm \nfamily income, with the remainder reverting to the State. Domestication of nontimber forest \nproducts (NTFPs) in village gardens will offset the ongoing degradation of this resource base \ndue to uncontrolled harvesting from the wild. \n \n3.  Livelihood modeling demonstrates that sedentary agriculture augmented by farm forestry \nis feasible.  In the target area, a typical farm family practicing shifting cultivation utilizes just over \n10 hectares (ha) for its agriculture/bush fallow rotational cycle.  By implementing sedentary \nagriculture, land requirement per family can be reduced to an average of 2.4 ha. The potential \nproduction from 2.4 ha under sedentary agriculture is considerably greater than that from 10 ha \nunder shifting cultivation.  Sedentary agriculture would permit the release of over 7 ha per family \nfor regeneration as productive forest.  Of this rehabilitated forest, 3 ha would be allocated to \neach  family  as  community  and  village  production  forest  that,  under  sustained  yield \nmanagement, will provide firewood and housing maintenance timber as well as approximately 3 \ncubic meters (m3) of salable lumber per family per year to augment income from agriculture.  \nThe remaining 4 ha will be returned to state management for production or conservation forestry \nas appropriate.  This agroforestry strategy, incorporating improved productivity possible under \nsedentary agriculture and augmented by income from farm forestry, will lift farm family livelihood \nwell above subsistence levels to approximately $1,900 per family per year.  This is close to \ndouble what is currently possible under shifting cultivation, while remaining well within the labor \ncapacity of the farm family. \n \n4.  Sedentary agriculture would focus on the low slope valley bottoms and gentle foot \nslopes where stabilization and soil erosion protection measures are relatively straightforward to \nestablish.  This will release large areas of medium- to high-slope land, currently used for shifting \ncultivation, for reforestation.  Reforestation on middle and high slopes will have multiple benefits \nincluding income generation for local communities, revenue for the State, watershed protection ", "12 Appendix 2 \nthrough soil erosion, enhanced biodiversity habitat, etc.  Watershed protection in the hills is vital \nto  sustainability  of  irrigated  agriculture  in  the  valleys.    In  essence,  making  the  agriculture \nsedentary  is  a  prerequisite  for  reforestation,  while  reforestation  is  essential  for  generating \ncomplementary income and maintaining the sustainability of sedentary agriculture, especially \nthrough irrigation, in addition to other environmental and economic benefits. \n \nB.  Scope of the Nam Ha Project \n5.  The JFPR Project.  The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) Project will focus on \nthe development of sedentary and intensified agro-forestry livelihood systems that will lift farm \nfamily awareness and productivity sufficiently to enable confident and equitable engagement in \nthe economic opportunities afforded by Route 3 upgrading.  The project will consist of the \nfollowing  components:  (i)  new  and  improved  irrigation  systems;  (ii)  terracing  for  rain-fed \nagriculture; (iii) forage cropping for livestock; (iv) rice production and postharvest management; \n(v) community forestry, village production forestry, and dedicated plantations for maintenance \nand repair of communal infrastructure.  This will pave the way for land occupancy certification \nthat will give local communities\u2019 land occupancy security.   \n \n6.  The PRF Project. The parallel complementary Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund \n(PRF) grant Project will focus on social preparation for the target communities. It will consist of  \n(i) land capability assessment for Vieng Phukha District; (ii) social preparation through a basic \nhealth and nonformal education program, product processing and marketing for the nine target \nvillages; (iii) land use planning, allocation, titling, and land-use rights education for the nine \ntarget villages; (iv) community-based natural resource management training and planning for \nthe nine target villages; and (v) capacity building for provincial and district government staff. The \npreparation will enhance the communities\u2019 ability to confidently and equitably partake of the \nopportunities of Route 3 upgrading while resisting potential negative social, economic, and \nenvironmental consequences.  \n \n7.  ADRA Germany Funding.  The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) \nfunding would be for income-generating activities of (i) fruit orchard development, (ii) NTFP \ndomestication, and (iii) livestock development. \n \nC.  Sustainability  \n1.  Social Sustainability \n8.  The Project will empower farm families through community organizations to participate in \ninformed decision making concerning their present and future livelihood. Having had on-the-\nground experience with land use and land occupancy stabilization, farm families will be able to \ninteract  on  an  equal  footing  with  outsiders  and  local  government  agencies  after  project \ncompletion.  The project area communities are representative of most of those along Route 3 \nand, as such, the project area will serve as a useful venue for demonstrating and extending to \nother communities the various poverty reduction strategies espoused. \n \n2.  Economic Sustainability \n \n9.  Livelihood  modeling  demonstrates  that  the  envisaged  developments,  when  fully \nimplemented, can be expected to raise household subsistence and cash incomes well above \nthe poverty line, as the following summary shows: \n ", "Appendix 2  13\nAnnual subsistence need for an average family of six people  $1,261 \nActual present income of an average family of six people  $   870 \nProjected  level  of  Income  with  project  intervention  after \nproject completion for an average family of six people  $1,904 \n \n10.  Such enhanced livelihoods will remove any necessity or justification for beneficiaries to \ncontinue with current unsustainable or undesirable livelihood practices (e.g., slash-and-burn, \nwildlife poaching, illegal lumbering, narcotics production/trading, etc.) to meet family income \nneeds. \n \n11.  Project costs are approximately $2,700 per family, but only $60/ha for the overall target \narea and $108/ha for rehabilitated/regenerated production forest.  Annual incremental timber \nvalue of production forest in northern Lao PDR exceeds $200/ha. Thus, long-term returns from \nsustained  yield  forestry  on  land  released  and  protected  for  reforestation  by  agricultural \nintensification more than justify the proposed expenditure. \n \n3.  Technical Sustainability \n \n12.  Although the technologies being promoted may be new to the project area, they have \nbeen  well  proven  elsewhere  in  similar  environments.    The  technologies  emphasize  labor-\nintensive rather than capital-intensive approaches wherever feasible.  Technicians from the \nconcerned government agencies will be trained on the job and will be involved effectively in \nupscaling to other areas.  The agricultural production systems being promoted place heavy \nemphasis on soil erosion control and maintenance of soil fertility. \n \n4.  Environmental Sustainability \n \n13.  The  proposed  strategy  involves  a  geographical  rather  than  a  sectoral  approach  to \nstabilize rural livelihoods and the project area without negatively impacting the livelihood of \nothers downstream, downwind, or in the future.  Reducing the agricultural area, reducing the \nincidence of fire, reforestation of steep-slope land, etc.\u2014all contribute positively to air and water \nquality, stream flow regime, and maintenance of a secure biodiversity habitat.   \n ", "14   Appendix 3 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n(US$\u2019000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
