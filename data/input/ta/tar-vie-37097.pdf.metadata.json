Subsequent to the satisfactory implementation of the Rural Infrastructure Sector Project \n(RISP),1 the Government of Viet Nam (the Government) requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the Rural Infrastructure for Sustainable \nLivelihood Improvement in Central Region Project.2 The TA is included as a firm project in the \nADB 2004 TA pipeline. A reconnaissance mission fielded during 19\u201327 May 2003 developed a \nbasic framework for the TA with the Government, and drew lessons learned from the RISP to be \nreflected in the new project formulation. Subsequently, a fact-finding mission fielded during 4\u201312 \nMarch 2004 discussed and agreed with the central and six participating provincial government \nagencies on the objective, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference of the TA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Among various development challenges, rural development remains one of the highest \npriorities of the Government. Viet Nam made substantial progress during the 1990s in reducing \npoverty, backed by strong economic growth. The overall poverty incidence declined from 58% in \n1993 to 29% in 2002, and social indicators improved rapidly at the same time.3 However, the \ndistribution of benefits gained from such growth has been uneven. The urban-rural income gap \nhas widened, leaving the poor, particularly in remote rural areas, comparatively worse off. The \nmost recent poverty mapping exercise revealed that the regional disparity in poverty incidence \nwas large and increasing over time, and the North Central Coast and the Central Highlands \nregions particularly show a steady increase in their contribution to poverty incidence.4 Data from \nthe General Statistics Office also indicate that poverty rates of ethnic minority groups are not \ndeclining as quickly as the rest of the population.5 Female-headed households are reported to \nbe in a particularly vulnerable state. Thus, effectively targeted assistance for the poor in most \nneed is increasingly becoming significant if the Government is to achieve its poverty reduction \ntargets. The Government has a strong commitment to promote economic growth with equity, \nwhich is reflected in the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. \n \n3.  Rural infrastructure development in poor rural communities has strategic significance in \nachieving the country\u2019s goal of growth with equity. Inadequate access infrastructure and poor \nstate of community infrastructure in remote rural villages are recognized to be key causes of \nwidening  regional  gaps  in  living  standards  and  economic  opportunities.  An  initial  social \nassessment (Appendix 1) found that a majority of the poor live in rural remote areas where \naccess to resources and opportunities to improve their lives is limited, and poor conditions of \nbasic  rural  infrastructure  are  fundamental  constraints  to  the  development  of  isolated  rural \ncommunities. In particular, substantial needs exist in poor areas in the North Central Coast to \nimprove road, water supply and sanitation, and irrigation infrastructure, which is highly relevant \nto addressing rural poverty issues.6 The poor state of roads and community infrastructure has \n                                                           \n1  Loan 1564-VIE (ADB. 1997. Rural Infrastructure Development Sector Project. Manila.) was approved in October \n1997 and is expected to close in December 2004. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 04 February 2004. \n3  Based on the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey of 1993 and 2002. \n4  Inter-ministerial Poverty Mapping Task Force. 2003.

Hanoi.  \n6  The Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting. 2004. Vietnam Development Report. Hanoi. For instance, more than \n1 million villagers in the North Central Coast do not have access to clean water, provision of more water supply \nfacilities combined with appropriate understanding of hygiene issues would significantly contribute to reducing \nwaterborne diseases caused by contaminated water among humans as well as livestock.  ", "2  \nresulted  in  isolation  of  poor  villages,  their  poor  access  to  social  services,  and  stagnant \nagricultural development  due  to  limited  input  supply  and  inefficient  use  of  land  and  water \nresources, few output trading opportunities, and inadequate flow of information and technology. \nTherefore, investments in rural infrastructure should serve as a vehicle to address regional \ninequality by improving the living standards and promoting economic development opportunities \nof disadvantaged and remote communities in the impoverished region. Such an approach is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s poverty partnership agreement7 and the country strategy and program. In \naddition, if water supply infrastructure is to be developed, sanitation and hygiene promotion \nactivities should be included alongside physical infrastructure development in order to assist the \nGovernment in achieving the development targets stipulated in the National Rural Water Supply \nand Sanitation Strategy (NRWSSS). This would require effective intervention models developed \nby existing government and other funding agency projects.8  \n \n4.  Despite satisfactory implementation in general, the RISP has critical areas that should \nbe improved by future rural infrastructure sector interventions to maximize their contribution to \nreducing rural poverty. Scattered subprojects of the RISP and limited beneficiary participation in \nsubproject  planning  and  implementation  have  weakened  the  relevance  of  investments  to \npoverty  reduction,  ownership,  and  understanding  of  stakeholders  on  their  maintenance \nresponsibilities.  Key  lessons  learned  from  the  RISP  emphasize  the  significance  of  (i) an \nintegrated investment approach to address the development needs of poor communities more \neffectively;  (ii) more  active  beneficiary  participation  in  identification,  planning,  designing, \nimplementing,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  subprojects;  (iii) identification  of \ntechnical, institutional, and financial O&M arrangements for each type and scale of infrastructure \nto ensure its sustainable use; and (iv) establishment of a management framework that will \nsystematically  evaluate  and  monitor  environmental  and  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  in \norder to fully comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies.  \n \n5.  To make infrastructure investments more relevant to the priority development needs of \npoor  beneficiaries,  particularly  women  and  ethnic  minority  groups,  a  more  integrated  and \nparticipatory approach in identifying rural infrastructure investments should be employed during \nthe medium-term regional socioeconomic development strategy formulation. Rural infrastructure \ndevelopment planning should begin with (i) identification of target poor areas, (ii) analysis of \nthese areas\u2019 development needs, and (iii) gender and ethnicity dimensions of poverty. More \nefforts to support active participation of beneficiaries in selecting and planning subprojects \nshould  be  made,  particularly  for  small-scale  community  infrastructure  development.  In  this \nrespect, practical and cost-effective modalities to facilitate active beneficiary participation in \nidentifying, planning, designing, and implementing rural infrastructure investments need to be \ndeveloped.  Such  participatory  rural  infrastructure  development  processes  should  also  be \nincorporated in the current planning system at the district and province levels. The forms of \ncommunity participation should be differentiated depending on the nature of decision-making \nstyles required for various scales and types of infrastructure. Planning of investments should \nalso consider all relevant future investments planned in the target areas, and strategically \nintegrate infrastructure investments with other investments to maximize synergy effects and \nadequately address the identified priority needs of the poor. The type, location, and scale of \ninfrastructure should also be planned with consideration of the interdependence of various types \nof infrastructure.9  \n                                                           \n7  ADB and the Government signed the agreement on 25 February 2002. \n8  Including  projects  funded  by  Danish  International  Development  Assistance  (Danida),  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank. \n9  For instance, there may be a choice between providing road access to an existing school or building more \nschools. ", "  3\n \n6.  To secure the sustainable use of rural infrastructure, appropriate and workable O&M \nmechanisms need to be developed for each type and scale of infrastructure depending on its \nnature, affordability to beneficiaries, and work requirements as a key part of investment planning \nprocess.10 All subprojects need to be designed in accordance with the expected demand of \nproject beneficiaries, their ability and willingness to pay and technical capacity. Effective O&M \nrequires not only adequate funding, but also the capacity to carry out the work.  \n \n7.  A preliminary policy analysis and institutional assessment found a sound framework for \nrural infrastructure development in place. The policy framework stipulated in the Comprehensive \nPoverty Reduction and Growth Strategy and the 10-year Socioeconomic Development Plan \nsupport rural infrastructure development as a means to improve the well-being of the poor and \nto correct growing regional disparities.11 The experience of RISP has demonstrated adequate \nimplementation capacity of provincial governments to appraise and implement subprojects. \nFurther  analysis  is  required  to  evaluate  the  sector  development  plan  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD),  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  sector \ndevelopment  plan,  possible  need  for  policy  and  regulatory  improvement,  coordination \nmechanisms among the departments of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) and other \nprovincial government agencies, available human and fiscal resources at the provincial and \ndistrict levels, and management structures to undertake O&M required for each type and scale \nof rural infrastructure. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  prepare  a  detailed  rural  infrastructure  sector \ninvestment proposal, including a prefeasibility study for the whole project and detailed feasibility \nstudies for three or four  sample subprojects, in order to contribute to the country's equitable \neconomic growth and reduction of rural poverty through improving basic rural infrastructure \nwithin the six project provinces.12 A draft project framework is attached in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will first review the Government\u2019s sector plans at the national and provincial \nlevels; assess past rural infrastructure investments and their lessons learned, the supporting \npolicy and regulatory environment, and key elements of sector expenditures; and analyze how \nthese  factors  are  reflected  in  the  commitments  and  capacity  of  the  national  and  local \ngovernment  agencies  to  finance  and  implement  rural  infrastructure  programs.  The  sector \nassessment will include institutional assessment, such as analysis of fund and information \nflows,  governance  system,  technical  and  administrative  capacity,  and  incentives  and \nperformance of existing institutions at the various levels. Based on the sector assessment, \nsocial state of beneficiaries, and other relevant investments planned in the project provinces, \n                                                           \n10  For many subprojects financed by the RISP, linkage between the construction phase and O&M phase remains \nweak, and often O&M arrangements are left to the relevant management agencies to work out after the \ncompletion of civil works. \n11  The 10-year Socioeconomic Development Plan specifies several targets for the provision of rural infrastructure for \nthe poor, including 100% of poor communities having access to essential infrastructure, 85% of the rural \npopulation having access to clean water supply, and 75% of rural households meeting sanitation standards by \n2010.  \n12  The project provinces are Ha Tinh, Nghe An,  Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, and Thanh Hoa. Participation \nof up to four additional provinces will be considered only if substantial additional financing becomes available. \n ", "4  \nthe TA will prepare practical subproject selection criteria and a medium-term rural infrastructure \ndevelopment plan for each participating province, which will strategically integrate the proposed \ninfrastructure investments with other planned economic and social development investments to \nmaximize synergy effects and ensure the delivery of tangible development benefits to the target \npoor areas.  \n \n10.  The  TA  will  mainly  prepare:  (i) a  review  report  on  lessons  learned  in  the  rural \ninfrastructure sector development; (ii) assessment of institutional framework, administrative and \nfinancial management capacity, efficiency of the current decentralized implementation model, \nand an institutional capacity-building program required for local government agencies to identify, \nplan, design, implement, and sustain subprojects more effectively; (iii) a list of ongoing and \nplanned  infrastructure  investments  for  the  next  10  years  in  each  project  province  and  a \ngeographic  information  system  map  to  indicate  their  locations;  (iv) a  medium-term  rural \ninfrastructure investment plan that indicates target poor areas and optimal clusters of rural \ninfrastructure development activities in each project province; (v) analysis of the social profiles, \nneeds,  and  absorptive  capacity  of  potential  project  beneficiaries,  including  an  indigenous \npeoples\u2019 development plan, an indigenous peoples\u2019 development framework, and a gender plan; \n(vi) a prefeasibility study for the whole project and detailed feasibility studies of three or four \nsample subprojects that satisfy the standard requirements of both the Government and ADB; \n(vii) a resettlement framework, resettlement plans, initial environment examinations for sample \nsubprojects, and an environmental management plan; and (viii) a sector development project \nproposal. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million equivalent, comprising $508,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $492,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$800,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange costs and part of the local currency \ncosts, amounting to $292,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The balance of the local currency costs, \namounting  to  $200,000  equivalent,  will  be  met  by  the  Government  to  cover  office \naccommodations, executing agency (EA) and provincial counterpart staff support, facilities for \nseminars and meetings, translation, maps, relevant data collection, part of local transport costs, \nand other administrative expenses. Relevant local government agencies will provide adequate \ncounterpart funds for preparation of selected sample subproject feasibility studies. A government \nrepresentative will be invited as an observer for TA contract negotiations. Detailed cost estimates \nare in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to financing any ensuing loan project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The  EA  for  the  TA  will  be  MARD,  which  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  TA \nimplementation, and establish a project preparation unit (PPU) headed by a director-level official \nto ensure smooth implementation of the TA. The PPU will report to a project coordination group \n(PCG) and ADB on implementation progress, and include a rural infrastructure engineer, social \ndevelopment specialist, resettlement specialist, and environment specialist. The PCG will be \nheaded by the vice minister of MARD and will comprise representatives from MARD,13 Ministry \nof Transport, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, State Bank of Viet Nam, \n                                                           \n13  At least one representative of the Center for Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation needs to be \nincluded. ", "  5\nand participating provincial governments. The PCG will be responsible for (i) overall policy \ndirection and guidance, (ii) coordination within the Government, (iii) resolution of outstanding TA \nimplementation issues, and (iv) provision of comments on major consultant outputs. The PPU \nwill work with consultants on a daily basis, and the PCG meeting will be held 2 weeks after the \nsubmission  of  consultants\u2019  main  reports.  Respective  DARDs  of  the  project  provinces  will \nestablish a provincial project preparation unit (PPPU) to serve as the TA counterpart at the \nprovince level. DARD will assign staff to the PPPU with expertise in regional development \nplanning, irrigation engineering, road engineering, rural water supply, resettlement, community \nparticipation, and environment as counterparts. The PPPUs will provide office accommodations, \nsupplies,  transport  (part-time),  translation  services,  and  other  logistics  and  administrative \nsupport as required.  \n \n13.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  11  months,  commencing  in  February  2005  with \ncompletion expected in December 2005. The TA will require a total of 62.5 person-months of \nconsulting services including 20.5 person-months of international and 42 person-months of \ndomestic consultancy. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. The rural infrastructure \ndevelopment  planner  will  lead  the  entire  team  of  TA  consultants.  The  rural  infrastructure \nengineer and resettlement specialists will be recruited individually, and the rest of the consultant \nteam will be selected and engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  In  preparing  feasibility  studies  for  potential  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \nactivities to be financed by an ensuing project, the consultant team will closely cooperate with \nthe  Royal  Danish  Embassy  in  Hanoi.  Community-based  organizations,  including \nnongovernment  organizations,  may  be  engaged  for  some  portion  of  the  consultants\u2019 \nassignment. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used for consulting firm \nselection,  and  shortlisted  consulting  firms  will  submit  simplified  technical  proposals.  The \nconsultants will purchase the necessary office equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Equipment procured under the TA will be handed over to the Government at \nTA completion.  \n \n14.  The medium-term rural infrastructure development plans will be developed based on \nconsultative  discussions  with  all  relevant  stakeholder  groups  including  various  beneficiary \ngroups and commune and district government officers. National stakeholder workshops will be \norganized on at least three occasions: the first at inception, and the next two to discuss the draft \ninterim report and the draft final report prepared under the TA. The consultants will prepare \n(i) an inception report including a detailed work program, to be submitted within 1 month of the \nstart of the TA and to be discussed at the initial tripartite review meeting; (ii) an interim report to \npresent preliminary findings based on the TA's interim results, to be submitted by the end of the \nfourth month of the TA and to be discussed at the interim tripartite review meeting; (iii) a draft \nfinal  report  about  2  months  before  the  final  report  and  to  be  discussed  at  national-  and \nprovincial-level workshops and the final tripartite review meeting; and (iv) a final report upon \ncompletion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Rural Infrastructure for Sustainable Livelihood \nImprovement in Central Region Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n  \nA.

Yes        country poverty partnership agreement?          Yes      \n                             \nThe proposed Rural Infrastructure for Sustainable Livelihood Improvement in Central Region Project \nsupports the national priority to improve rural infrastructure for the poor. The Comprehensive Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) and the 10-year Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) \nemphasize rural infrastructure development as a means to improving the well-being of the poor, \nparticularly those living in remote areas. The CPRGS prioritizes spending on infrastructure, and in \nparticular rural infrastructure to narrow the development gap and improve the living standards of the \npoor, in particular those of the ethnic minority. It also underscores that provision of rural infrastructure \nshould be needs-based. \n \nThe SEDP includes several targets related to the provision of rural infrastructure for the poor. These \ntargets include 100% of the poor communes having access to essential infrastructure, 85% of the rural \npopulation having access to clean water supply, and 75% of rural households meeting sanitation \nstandards by 2010. The SEDP highlights the need to pay attention to the provision of clean water \nsupply, particularly for those far away from roads. The targets related to clean water supply and \nsanitation are part of the National Strategy for Rural Clean Water Supply and Sanitation. One of Viet \nNam's Millennium Development Goals also includes the target of ensuring that 85% of rural people \nhave access to clean water supply by 2010. \n \nThe Project is consistent with the poverty partnership agreement (PPA) between the Government of \nViet Nam and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), signed on 14 March 2002. The PPA highlights the \nCentral region as a focus area for development assistance and promotes integrated development \nsupported by complementary investment, including development of rural infrastructure. \n \nInvestment in rural infrastructure will help reduce the increasing gap between urban and rural areas and \nalso mitigate growing regional disparities. Since the majority of the poor live in rural and remote areas, \ninvestment in rural infrastructure will improve their well-being and livelihoods. Better road access would \nenable more active participation of the poor in local market economies and would make possible their \nvisits  to  health  centers  and  school  attendance  for  children.  Clean  water  supply  and  sanitation, \ncombined  with  appropriate  public  education  on  hygiene  issues,  would  be  important  in  reducing \nwaterborne diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water among humans and also \namong livestock. Irrigation is important to increasing the productivity of land, while markets promote \ntrade,  encourage  diversification of  income source,  and  enable  information exchange.  Thus, rural \ninfrastructure is an important means for supporting economic activities and addressing key issues \nrelated to poverty in rural areas. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Proposed Classification: Economic growth \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe ensuing project will be implemented in the six provinces of Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Quang Binh, Ha \nTinh, Quang Tri, and Quang Nam. The targeted provinces are mainly in the North Central region that \ncomprises 13% of the total population, and accounts for approximately 20% of the poor.14 The region \nhas seen a steady increase in its contribution to overall poverty in Viet Nam. While poverty in Viet Nam \nhas declined from 58.1% in 1993 to 28.9% in 2002, regional disparity has increased, the rural-urban \n                                                           \n14  The General Statistics Office. 2002. Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey. Hanoi.  ", "Appendix 1     7 \nincome gap has widened, and poverty among ethnic minority groups is not declining as quickly as in \nthe rest of the population.15  \n \nTo ensure maximum social and economic benefits of the Project, a poverty and social analysis should \nbe undertaken to identify the target beneficiaries and subgroups in each province. To determine the \ntarget beneficiaries it would be important to review the provincial masterplan, the existing infrastructure, \nand investments already identified. A mapping exercise for each province will help to identify the \ndistribution of population, concentration of poverty, areas where different ethnic groups live, existing \nrural infrastructure, and investments in rural infrastructure in the pipeline. This exercise will be useful in \nidentifying the potential target beneficiaries.  \n \nThe varying needs, priorities, and attitudes toward the different types and scales of infrastructure \nprojects, including willingness and ability to contribute to the construction and to pay for services, \nshould be assessed for different groups (socioeconomic, gender, and ethnic) of the population. In the \nprocess, any population groups that may be affected by the Project or are disadvantaged should be \nidentified and appropriate mitigation measures should be prepared. \n \nThere are a number of rural infrastructure projects targeted at improving the well-being of the poor, \nparticularly those living in remote areas and ethnic minority groups. They include projects supported by \nthe Government (Program 135 and the Concretization Program) and by others such as International \nFund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  (Rural  Income  Diversification  Project  and  Ha  Giang \nDevelopment Project for Ethnic Minorities), and the World Bank (Community-based Rural Infrastructure \nProject). Many projects are being implemented in the Central region. Given the number of existing rural \ninfrastructure and development projects, attention should be paid to determining whether or not the \nrural infrastructure needs of groups who are not very poor but also not well-off are being addressed. \nWhile the very poor may receive rural infrastructure support on a grant basis, those slightly better-off \nare more likely to be requested contributions to build the required infrastructure. Given their limited \nsavings/income, these groups may have to borrow to meet the contribution requirements. However, \nthey may not be willing or have the capacity to borrow, given that they live on the margins of poverty. \nThe experience of existing initiatives should also be reviewed particularly on targeting of beneficiaries \nand community participation. The lessons learned should be incorporated in the project design to \nensure that implementation will be participatory and equitable. \n \nTo this end, during project preparation, the following main tasks should be undertaken: (i) identify the \nbeneficiaries and subgroups in each province that are expected to benefit from the Project, reviewing \nthe provincial masterplan, existing rural infrastructure and planned investments, determining their \nneeds, demands, priorities, and willingness and capacity to provide in-kind contribution and pay for \nservices,  by  socioeconomic  status,  gender,  and  ethnicity,  through  surveys/participatory  rapid \nappraisals; (ii) determine whether or not any groups of people will be affected or disadvantaged by the \nProject and prepare appropriate mitigation measures; (iii) propose an approach to balance the differing \nneeds for various types/scales of rural infrastructure given variations in socioeconomic status, gender, \nand ethnicity, to maximize the social and economic benefits of the Project; and (iv) review and develop \nthe approach for integrating participation into the Project, taking into account the different types of rural \ninfrastructure.  \n \n \nC .  Participation Process  \nStakeholder Analysis                                                                               Yes \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  should  be  undertaken  during  project  preparation  to  determine  the  key \nstakeholders  and  their  roles,  interests,  and  priorities.  Stakeholders  would  include  the  national, \nprovincial, and district level government officers; commune and village or hamlet chiefs; and the \n                                                                                                                                                          \n15  The Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting. 2004.

It  would  be  important  to  assess  the  capacity  of  different  stakeholders,  in \nparticular at the commune and village levels to equitably participate in the process of selection, design, \nimplementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M). The appropriate roles and responsibilities at \nthe provincial, district, commune, and village levels in the O&M of different types of rural infrastructure \nsubprojects need to be determined. It is also important to assess the affordability for community \nmembers to participate in identification, planning, design, and implementation in terms of labor and \nmaterial contribution to construction works and monetary contribution to services and O&M for different \ntypes/scales of rural infrastructure. Specific attention is required to assess the needs and priorities of \nwomen  and  ethnic  minority  groups,  and  to  identify  any  capacity-building  and  training  needs  to \ncomplement investments in rural infrastructure under the ensuing Project. \n \nParticipation Strategy \nDifferent types/scales of rural infrastructure will require varying levels of community participation and \ncontribution  to  the  project  identification,  design,  implementation,  monitoring,  operation  and \nmaintenance. In Viet Nam, participatory development appears to focus mainly on consultations at the \nvillage level, which provides the basis for developing the socioeconomic development plan at the \nprovincial level, and for implementing government projects targeted at reducing poverty.  \n \nReview of existing projects in Viet Nam focused on community-based, participatory rural infrastructure \ndevelopment  indicates  that  more  active  community  participation  is  required  to  encourage  real \nownership. Active community participation is especially important for small-scale infrastructure that has \ndirect impact on community well-being and livelihood. It builds ownership and supports the sustainable \nuse and maintenance of the infrastructure in the longer-term. So far, the respective projects appear to \nhave different levels of community engagement. Thus, during project preparation, the experience of \nother community-based rural infrastructure projects should be reviewed. Based on the results, the most \nrealistic and practical approaches for community participation should be adopted for the Project, \ncarefully considering women\u2019s and ethnic minorities\u2019 roles, priorities, and needs in the decision-making \nprocess.  These  approaches  should  also  take  into  account  the  different  types/scales  of  rural \ninfrastructure  and  the  specific  requirements  to encourage  the  participation  of  women and  ethnic \nminorities.   \n \nIn developing an appropriate approach for effective community participation for the Project, consider \nexisting  organizational  structures/mechanisms  that  may  act  as  effective  conduits  for  community \nparticipation and communication methods. Capacity building required to facilitate participation should \nalso be identified. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women \nDevelopment of rural infrastructure may dramatically improve the livelihood of women. For example, in \nViet Nam as in many other Asian countries, women and children are the ones to collect water for the \nhousehold and for livestock. Thus, provision of clean water supply will enable women to allocate time \nrequired to fetch water for other productive purposes. Inequality within the household, particularly \nburdensome workload of women, opportunities, and time and access to information and opportunities, \nand legal and other sociocultural barriers that may hinder women\u2019s participation in decision-making \ndiscussions will be analyzed. Many women are also traders and they are the ones to bring fresh produce \nand other products to the markets. As such, safe road access and clean markets are important.  \n \nIt may be the case that the priorities of women differ slightly from men with regard to rural infrastructure \ngiven their different household responsibilities. Thus, it is important to involve women and seek their \ninputs. Women should be actively consulted and engaged in the subproject identification, design, \nimplementation, monitoring, and O&M of small-scale infrastructure. While women in Viet Nam appear to ", "Appendix 1     9 \nhave an active voice through the Women's Union, it is important to include measures to reach and \ncommunicate with women to promote their participation. Based on the analysis of the gender dimension \nof poverty and focused consultative field discussions, a gender plan will be developed. The plan will \nreflect the needs and priorities of women, particularly among ethnic minority groups, and may entail \ncapacity  building  and  training.  Care  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  women  are  not  affected  or \ndisadvantaged by the Project. \n \n \nE.

Thus, \nresettlement  plans  should  be \nprepared  as  required  for  core \nsubprojects and a framework should \nbe  prepared  in  accordance  with \nADB's resettlement policy.  \nAffordability  Significant  A survey/participatory rapid appraisal  To be determined \nshould  be  undertaken  to  measure \nand determine ability and willingness \nof different income groups to pay for \nservices  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  for  each  rural \ninfrastructure  type.  It  should  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Handbook  on  Poverty  and \nSocial  Analysis  and  Handbook  for \nIncorporation  of  Social  Dimensions \nin Projects. A mitigation plan may be \nrequired  to  address  affordability \nissues. \nLabor  May be significant  There is an expectation for in-kind  No \ncommunity  contribution,  which \nnormally is in the form of labor. The \nissues  related  to  combining  local \ncontractors  and  community  labor \nshould be considered. There is also \na need to ensure that there are not \ntoo  many  projects  ongoing  at \ncommune and village levels at the \nsame time where in-kind contribution \nis  required  since  community \nmembers  may  be  overburdened. \nLabor  seasonality  should  also  be \nconsidered  to  ensure  that  labor \ncontribution is not being requested \nduring, for example, the planting and \nharvesting seasons. \nIndigenous  May be significant  Category B. Further investigation is  To be determined \nPeoples  required  to  determine  how  ethnic \nminority groups may be affected or \n ", " 10 Appendix 1 \ndisadvantaged.  While  many  of  the \nethnic  minorities  live  in  isolated \nareas in the six targeted provinces, it \nis  also  evident  that  in  some \ncommunes,  ethnic  minorities  are \nactive members of their community \nand  their  representatives  are \ncommune chiefs or district heads. An \nethnic  minority  development  plan \nmay  be  required.  Additionally,  a \nframework may be required for the \nProject.  It  may  be  possible  to \naddress the issues and constraints \nof  participation  by  the  ethnic \nminorities  through  the  detailed \napproach for community participation \nin the Project. \nOther Risks    The  project  design  should  ensure  No \nand/or  that the project activities reach the \nVulnerabilities  targeted  beneficiaries.  For  core \nsubprojects related to road access, \nrisks related to increased mobility of \npeople  and  possible  rise  in  the \nexploitation  of  local  and  natural \nresources will be reviewed. \n \nCPRGS = Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy; O&M = operation and maintenance; PPA = \npoverty partnership agreement;  SEDP = Socioeconomic Development Plan.", "Appendix 2     11 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nEquitable economic  \u2022 Average growth in annual  \u2022 Annual survey of   \ngrowth and reduction of  real per capita  MOLISA \nrural poverty within the  expenditure - increased  \u2022 Biennial survey of \nsix project provinces  from 7.4 % (1993\u20131998)  GSO \nthrough improving basic  \u2022 Absolute poverty head   \u2022 Project baseline \nrural infrastructure  counts -  reduced from     survey \n     48% (1998)  \u2022 Project completion \n\u2022 Regional disparity    report \nreduced \n \nPurpose      Assumptions: \nProvide essential rural  \u2022 Social indicators in the  \u2022 Household living  \u2022 Target poor population \ninfrastructure to    target areas improved    standards survey    that needs assistance \nimprove the livelihoods  \u2022 Agricultural production in  \u2022 Project baseline    most is identified, and their \nof rural population and    the target areas    survey    priority needs adequately \nto increase economic    increased  \u2022 PPMS reports    studied \nopportunities in the  \u2022 Distribution of goods and     \ntarget poor areas     services improved in the  \u2022 The Government\u2019s \n    target areas    commitment to address \n  the critical development \n  needs of the rural poor  \n \nOutputs       \n      Assumptions: \n1.
