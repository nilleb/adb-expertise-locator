I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the South Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation Dhaka\u2013Northwest Corridor Road Project, Phase 2. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Updating the Road Master Plan, and \nif the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will improve the road connectivity and efficiency of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest \ninternational trade corridor.1 Three outputs will be delivered: (i) Dhaka\u2013Northwest international \ntrade corridor (Elenga\u2013Hatikumrul\u2013Rangpur) upgraded; (ii) institutional capacity of the Roads and \nHighways Department (RHD) for road operation and management enhanced; and (iii) stronger \nroad safety and gender-responsive features, and the cost overrun for phase 1 of the Dhaka\u2013\nNorthwest  international  trade  corridor  (Joydeypur\u2013Chandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga)  financed. 2 To \nensure the sustainability of the outcome, associated TA is proposed to assist the government in \nupdating its master plan for roads and improving its planning capacity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic context. Bangladesh reached lower middle-income status in July 2015. With its \nyoung and rapidly growing population, Bangladesh has the potential to become a major exporter \nof labor-intensive products. Its location between South and Southeast Asia provides the country \ngood prospects of becoming a regional trading hub. But the country\u2019s transport infrastructure is \ninadequate, which raises costs, reduces competitiveness, and impedes intra-regional trade. As \nsuch, Bangladesh\u2019s successive 5-year development plans embed regional cooperation and \nintegration,  which  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  through  its  projects  in \nBangladesh.3 \n \n4.  Sector road map. Bangladesh\u2019s transport system consists of roads, railways, inland \nwaterways, maritime shipping facilities, and civil aviation. Road transport\u2019s modal share is over \n70% for passenger traffic and 60% for freight. Traffic has been growing at an average rate of \nabove 8% per year. The government has three main policy documents for the road subsector: (i) \nthe Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020,4 (ii) the Road Master Plan,5 and (iii) the National \nIntegrated Multimodal Transport Policy.6 Guided by these policies, the government is gradually \n                                                \n1  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, \n2017\u20132019. Manila. The project\u2019s title was changed to reflect its location and nature. The Government of Bangladesh \nrefers to the project as \u201cSASEC Road Connectivity Project-II: Improvement of Elenga-Hatikumrul-Rangpur Road to \na 4-Lane Highway\u201d. No project preparatory TA and/or project design advance is required. \n2  ADB. 2012.

Manila. The Road Connectivity Project is considered \nphase 1 of this proposed project, since there is strong correlation between these two segments of the Dhaka\u2013\nNorthwest international trade corridor. \n3  ADB. 2016.

Dhaka. \n ", "2 \nupgrading the main corridors to facilitate international trade with and between Bhutan, India, \nMyanmar,  and  Nepal.  However,  road  agencies\u2019  human,  technical,  and  financial  resource \nlimitations have hindered progress in eliminating the bottleneck issues caused by limited road \ncapacity, deteriorated conditions, and the mixture of slow- and fast-moving traffic. \n \n5.  Policy framework. The Seventh Five Year Plan aims for a well-maintained, cost-effective, \ndurable, and safe road network. RHD is implementing a series of institutional development actions \nto meet the target.7 The Road Master Plan focused on the main roads when it was prepared in \n2009 and is now due for an update to meet the needs for subregional corridors and rural roads. \nThe government requested ADB support in updating the Road Master Plan. \n \n6.  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation.  Transport  infrastructure  is  the \ncenterpiece of the ADB-supported South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) \nprogram, which promotes regional prosperity.8 Since 2001, SASEC member countries have \ninvested over $9.17 billion in projects with a regional dimension, including 31 transport projects \nworth  $7.30  billion.  SASEC  transport  investments  in  Bangladesh  and  neighboring  member \ncountries  focus  on  developing  South  Asian  Association  of  Regional  Cooperation  highway \ncorridors. The SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025 identified 128 priority regional cooperation \nand integration transport projects worth about $63 billion\u2014of which 35 are in Bangladesh.9 \n \n7.  Dhaka\u2013Northwest International Trade Corridor. Among the subregional corridors, the \ngovernment  considers  the  Dhaka\u2013Northwest  international  trade  corridor  on  South  Asian \nAssociation of Regional Cooperation highways 4 and 8 as top priorities.10 The corridor is the \nsecond busiest artery in Bangladesh after the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong road. At the northwestern end \nof the corridor is the Burimari Land Port, which is managed by the Bangladesh Land Port Authority \nand  provides  a  gateway  to  Bhutan  through  India.  Improving  the  transport  infrastructure  is \nexpected  to  significantly  increase  trade  in  the  land  port.  ADB  has  been  a  partner  of  the \ngovernment in improving the Dhaka\u2013Northwest international trade corridor since 1994.11 \n \n8.  Road Connectivity Project. In 2012, ADB approved a $198 million loan for the SASEC \nRoad Connectivity Project (footnote 2), which is considered phase 1 of the proposed project, since \nthere is strong correlation between the phase 1 and phase 2 segments of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest \ninternational trade corridor. Phase 1 (i) increased road capacity on 70 kilometers (km) of the \nJoydeypur\u2013Elenga section of the international trade corridor, (ii) improved operational efficiency of \nthe Benapole and Burimari land ports, and (iii) enhanced the institutional capacity of the RHD.12 \nThe project is performing well based on the following criteria: \n                                                \n7  Institutional Development Action Plan Update (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  SASEC comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n9  ADB. 2016. South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025. Manila. \n10 Because of the large financing and implementation resources required, the government plans to improve the corridor \nin three phases: (i) Joydeypur\u2013Elenga section and the Burimari Land Port, (ii) Elenga\u2013Hatikumrul\u2013Rangpur section, \nand (iii) Rangpur\u2013Burimari section. \n11  ADB. 1994. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Jamuna Bridge Project. Manila; ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of \nBangladesh for the Jamuna Bridge Access Roads Project. Manila. \n12  The financing plan of the SASEC Road Connectivity Project comprises (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR128,114,000 ($198 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; (ii) a $30 million loan from the \nOPEC Fund for International Development, administered by ADB for procurement and disbursement supervision; \nand (iii) a $30 million loan from the Abu Dhabi Fund for International Development for the parallel financing of the \ncivil works to upgrade about 10 km of project road. The government is financing the remaining local cost of \n$86.7 million equivalent, based on cost estimates during project preparation. \n ", "3 \n(i)  Delivery of expected outputs. The output delivery is satisfactory: project roads \nwill be completed by December 2018 and improvement of the land ports is on track. \nThe RHD is implementing the institutional development actions as planned. \n(ii)  Satisfactory implementation progress. As of 30 June 2017, or 82% into the loan \nperiod, the cumulative contract award eligible for ADB loan financing was $243.09 \nmillion13 (140.00% of projection) and the cumulative disbursement was $75.83 \nmillion (31.20% of cumulative contract award and 114.20% of projection).  \n(iii)  Satisfactory compliance with safeguard policy requirements. The project\u2019s \ncompliance with safeguard policy requirements is proceeding satisfactorily. \n(iv)  Successful management of risks. The mitigation measures have been well \nimplemented. Project implementation is not threatened by major risks. \n(v)  On track rating. The project has been rated on track for over 12 months as of \nsecond quarter 2017. \n \n9.  However, phase 1 faces a cost overrun of about $150 million on the components financed \nby ADB because the (i) depreciation of the special drawing rights relative to the US dollar raised \ncosts by about $33.3 million;14 (ii) road safety and gender-responsive features were further \nstrengthened, which added about $34.3 million; and (iii) actual contract prices are about $82.4 \nmillion higher than the engineer\u2019s estimates. Other lessons from phase 1 are: (i) procurement of \ncivil works should be advanced to minimize the delays, (ii) the quality of the engineering design \nand cost estimate should be assured through systematic reviews, (iii) the government should \nrelease counterpart funds in a timely manner, (iv) safeguard actions should be advanced to the \nextent possible, and (v) institutional enhancement requires long-term support. \n \n10.  Phase 2. In 2017, the government plans to start phase 2, which is to improve the 190 km \nsection from Elenga through Hatikumrul to Rangpur.15 The proposed project will continue ADB \nsupport to the corridor. To manage the issues faced during phase 1, RHD has (i) set up a project \nimplementation committee to review engineering designs; (ii) obtained government approval for \nthe  project  proposal  in  advance  to  set  up  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  prepare \nprocurement documents, and initiate safeguard actions; and (iii) requested ADB support to update \nits Road Master Plan. \n \n11.  Financing modality. An MFF is proposed as the financing modality.16 Table 1 explains \nwhy an MFF is more suitable than other modalities. Based on phase 1 implementation, the \ngovernance risks, security issues, and political concerns are manageable. The ADB project team \nhas completed due diligence for the entire MFF scope to enable financing as a large stand-alone \nproject applying a time-slice approach. \n \nTable 1: Comparison of Financing Modality \nComparison \nIssues  MFF  Project Loan  Remark \nThe project cost is about  An MFF enables ADB to offer financial The possible size is significantly  MFF is \n$1,672.6 million.  resources in tranches.  less than the requirement.  preferred. \n                                                \n13 Based on latest review, further contract variations are expected, which will add about $36.31 million.  \n14 Consists of currency depreciation of about $23.4 million, and estimated financing charges of about $9.9 million for \nthe additional financing of phase 1. \n15 Excluding the Bangabandhu bridge (also known as the Jamuna bridge).  \n16 Comparison of Financing Modality and Approach to Time-Slice Financing (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nComparison \nIssues  MFF  Project Loan  Remark \nThe sustainability of  An MFF allows ADB assistance to be  Client needs are mainly  MFF is \nsubregional road improvements aligned with the client\u2019s long-term  assessed in the country  preferred. \nrequires continuous efforts.  needs.  programming dialogue. \nThe government will strengthen An MFF allows ADB to enter a  The support provided by a  MFF is \nits institutional capacity for the  sustained partnership on the  project loan is subject to the size preferred. \ncorridor operation.  institutional strengthening plan.  and term of the loan. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MFF = multitranche financing facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The impacts will be that (i) an efficient and modern road transport system in Bangladesh \nis achieved, and (ii) subregional connectivity and trade are improved. The outcome will be that \nthe road connectivity of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest international trade corridor is improved. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The proposed project will deliver three outputs: (i) phase 2 of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest \ninternational trade corridor (Elenga\u2013Hatikumrul\u2013Rangpur section) is upgraded; (ii) the RHD\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity in road operation and management is enhanced; and (iii) stronger road \nsafety and gender-responsive features, and cost overrun for phase 1 of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest \ninternational  trade  corridor  (Joydeypur\u2013Chandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga  section)  are  financed  and \ncompleted. \n \nD.

Interest during construction for regular ADB loans from ordinary capital \nresources has been computed at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a spread of 0.5%. \nCommitment charges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. Interest \nduring construction for concessional ADB loans from ordinary capital resources has been computed at 2% per year. \nThere is no commitment charge for concessional ADB loans from ordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Roads and Highways Department estimates. \n \n15.  The government has requested an MFF of up to $1,200 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance part of the project. The MFF will consist of about four \n ", "5 \ntranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement.17 The MFF will \nprovide regular and concessional loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources up to the aggregate \nMFF amount. Any allocation for concessional loans will be subject to (i) the availability of such \nresources, (ii) Bangladesh\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy18 and \nthe requirements of donors for such resources, and (iii) the availability of such resources to \nBangladesh given ADB\u2019s policy of performance-based allocation of such resources.19 Any change \nin the amount of concessional loans will be balanced by a corresponding change in the regular \nloans\u2014total financing provided under the MFF is not to exceed the aggregate MFF amount. \n \n16.  The Japan International Cooperation Agency, as a collaborative cofinancier for the project, \nwill finance the Western Bangladesh Bridge Improvement Project through a loan of \u00a529,340 \nmillion. Under the collaborative project, about 60 bridges will be constructed in the same area \ncovered by this proposed project, which will enhance land transport connectivity toward India. \n \n17.  Time-slice financing. The financing plan and an indicative tranche schedule for the \nproject are in Table 3. The MFF will finance slices of long-term contract packages, each tranche \nwill finance slices of a group of contracts per the indicative tranche schedule, and the amount for \neach tranche will be requested per the disbursement progress and projection. The tranche \nschedule  is  based  on  the  disbursement  projection.  Preconstruction  activities  such  as  land \nacquisition, resettlement, and procurement will be all advanced to the first 3 years of the project. \nThe government has completed preparation and due diligence for the project, and, following the \ndisbursement-based tranche approach, it intends to request tranche 1 together with the MFF to \nfinance the first slice of the project. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n  Amount  Total \nTranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3  Tranche 4  Amount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank             \nOrdinary capital     \nresources \n(concessional loan)  50.0    50.0  3.0 \nOrdinary capital \nresources \n(regular loan)  250.0  300.0  300.0  300.0  1,150.0  68.7 \nGovernment  171.4  100.0  100.0  101.2  472.6  28.3 \nTotal  471.4  400.0  400.0  401.2  1,672.6  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n21.  Transaction TA for Updating the Road Master Plan will be provided along with the \nproject.24 The TA will support the government in (i) updating the Road Master Plan, (ii) enhancing \n                                                \n22 Such features will be incorporated in the existing civil works contracts. In general, the MFF policy allows for additional \nfinancing for \u201cpurely price or financing arrangement changes.\u201d ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming Multitranche Financing \nFacility. Manila (para. 78). In this project, the features are introduced to enhance road safety and gender \nresponsiveness within the project scope. \n23 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The contracts awarded \nunder phase 1 will be completed with variations for the stronger road safety and gender-responsive features. Those \nof the project implementation consultants will be extended as necessary to complete construction supervision. \n24 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Because of the \nmultidisciplinary expertise required to manage the TA tasks, the government requested ADB to provide TA and \ndirectly supervise the consultants together with the executing agencies. \n ", "7 \nthe planning capacity of RHD and the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), and \n(iii) facilitating and monitoring key project implementation activities, such as procurement and land \nacquisition. LGED is responsible for provision of rural roads, but does not have any master plan. \nThe updated Master Plan will expand its scope to include national highways, including subregional \ncorridor highways, and rural roads. RHD and the LGED will be the executing agencies for the TA, \nwhich will be implemented from January 2018 to December 2023. The TA is estimated to cost \n$2,220,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-6).  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, data, reports, and other in-kind contributions. ADB will engage consulting firms \nand individual consultants following its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  Phase 2. The engineering designs are optimized for economy, construction efficiency, \nroad safety, and gender responsiveness following applicable international and national design \nstandards.  The  construction  method  will  use  proven  technology  and  standard  materials \ncompatible with local conditions, including concrete pavement used at the locations of bus \nstations. The contracts will incorporate performance-based maintenance for 6 years as part of \npublic\u2013private partnership initiatives. Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries \nglobally, and the government has anticipated future increases in intensity and frequency of \nrainfalls  and  floods  that  require  road  design  modifications.  Accordingly,  the  RHD  has \nstrengthened the engineering design regarding embankment level, bridge height, and pavement \nand drainage structures. The incremental costs for the climate change adaptation measures is \nabout $55.6 million. The project implementation consultants will conduct road safety audits during \nthe design, construction, and maintenance stages. \n \n23.  Phase 1. The RHD reviewed and strengthened the engineering designs for the road safety \nand gender-responsive features. Two flyovers at congested junctions, six underpasses, 22 km of \nfootpath, and two bridges for slow-moving vehicles will be added to the civil works. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic viability. The economic analysis compared the societal cost of transportation \nwith and without the project, considering the benefits of capacity augmentation and better service \non the project road sections. The project will reduce vehicle operating costs and travel time for \nroad users and improve road safety for motorized and non-motorized traffic. Without the project, \ntraffic congestion will cripple movement on the road corridors. \n \n25.  The project benefits will include vehicle operating cost savings, travel time savings, fewer \naccidents, reduced vehicle emissions, and less congestion along the corridor. The project will \nalso aid the economic development of the region served by the corridor. The economic internal \nrate of return for the project is estimated at 17.4% for the phase 2 road section, 19.9% for the \nphase 1 road sections with updated costs, and 18.4% for the combined project, which indicates \nthat the overall project is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the \neffects of unfavorable changes in the key parameters that affect the project\u2019s costs and benefits. \nThe economic viability remained satisfactory in the sensitivity analyses. \n \n ", "8 \n26.  Financial  sustainability.  The  project  will  be  implemented  with  performance-based \nmaintenance included in the contract for an extended period of 6 years after construction. The \ngovernment has substantially increased the allocation for maintenance from $88 million in FY2012 \nto $183 million in FY2016. As a result, the proportion of roads in good-to-fair condition increased \nfrom 40% to 63% in that period. Upon completion of performance-based maintenance under the \nproject for 6 years, incremental recurrent costs (annualized) associated with the project road \nsections are estimated to be 2.8% of the RHD\u2019s projected maintenance budget. The maintenance \nbudget  requirement  estimated for  the  project  road  is  within  the  limits  of the  proportionate \nmaintenance budget allocation for these road sections. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that \nfunds will be available to meet the maintenance requirements. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  Institutional and financial management. The RHD has the experience and sufficient \ncapacity to implement externally funded projects, particularly with regard to ADB disbursement \nprocedures. The implementation consultants will support the RHD in construction supervision and \ninstitutional enhancement. ADB has conducted a financial management assessment, which rated \nthe risk moderate. \n \n28.  Procurement and anticorruption. ADB will recruit consultants following its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). National procurement regulation \nhas improved through the Public Procurement Act, 2006 and the related Public Procurement \nRules,  2008  (with  subsequent  amendments).  The  World  Bank  also  supports  capacity \ndevelopment in procurement under the Public Procurement Reform Project II. Procurement of \nworks and goods will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) \nand use bidding documents that are in line with ADB policies and include a policy statement on \navoiding corrupt practices. Bidding packages procured using national competitive bidding will \nfollow  the  government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act  and  Public  Procurement  Rules,  with \nmodifications agreed between the government and ADB, as set out in the procurement plan. The \nRHD will publish on its website (i) procurement information relating to the project, including \nbusiness  opportunities;  and  (ii)  the  project  implementation  track  record.  To  enhance  good \ngovernance, the RHD will involve in its procurement processes a procurement advisor to be \nengaged under the attached TA. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the RHD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual.25 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  Social.  The  project  is  expected  to  improve  accessibility  between  Dhaka  and  the \nnorthwestern region of Bangladesh. This will in turn facilitate intra-regional and international trade \nand contribute to poverty reduction. Overall, poverty rates in the districts26 crossed by the road \nrange from 20% to 47%, with the main sources of income being business, day labor, and \nagriculture. Road safety remains a major challenge, with pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists \naccounting for 80% of fatalities. The project is expected to reduce road accidents and fatalities \nthrough the inclusion of key safety design features, notably lanes dedicated to slow-moving \nvehicles (i.e., rickshaws, bicycles, motorcycles, and tractors) and footbridges for pedestrians. The \n                                                \n25 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Bogra, Gaibandha, Rangpur, Sirajganj, and Tangail. \n ", "9 \nproject\u2019s key beneficiaries will be the estimated 15 million residents in the districts, as well as \nbusinesses, particularly those in the trade sector. \n \n31.  Bangladesh has a low HIV prevalence rate (0.7% reported among high-risk groups). The \ncountry remains an important source of internal and cross-border human trafficking. The project \nis not expected to contribute to an increase in HIV incidence or human trafficking because it is \nonly expanding an existing corridor. The contractor will conduct an awareness program on \npreventing HIV transmission and human trafficking for its personnel and the local community. \n \n32.  Gender. Tranche 1 is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The same category is \nexpected for the subsequent tranches because due diligence already covers the entire scope of \nthe MFF. Women\u2019s modes of transport in the project area are mixed but are dominated by walking \n(55%) followed by using slow-moving vehicles such as rickshaws (33%). The majority of women \nsurveyed during due diligence (64%) stated that they would be comfortable traveling alone by \nbus. The objectives of women\u2019s most frequent motorized journey patterns are to visit relatives, \nshop, and go to work. Given their preference for walking and rickshaws, women are particularly \nvulnerable to road accidents. The project will  thus improve women\u2019s accessibility to these \ndestinations while making their journeys safer. \n \n33.  The project includes a gender action plan with proactive gender-mainstreaming features: \n(i) integrated gender-responsive and safety design features (i.e., slow-moving vehicular traffic \nlanes,  footpaths,  and  pedestrian  footbridges);  (ii)  road  safety  awareness  campaigns  for \ncommunities along the corridor with specific gender targets for pedestrians (target 50% women), \ndrivers, parents, schoolchildren (target 50% schoolgirls), and professional drivers; (iii) public \nawareness  campaign  on  preventing  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  human  trafficking, \ntargeting an audience with 50% women; (iv) proactive measures to support the rehabilitation of \nwomen who need to be resettled; (v) target to have women make up at least 15% of the road \nmaintenance teams; (vi) target to have women make up at least 40% of tree plantation program \nteams; and (vii) impact evaluation study on the gender responsiveness of phase 1. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement. Tranche 1 is classified category A as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement given its significant resettlement impacts. The same category is expected for \nthe subsequent tranches, since all activities have been appraised up front. The RHD conducted \na detailed survey of involuntary resettlement impacts and identified the acquisition of 198.94 \nhectares of private land and impacts on 17,200 households (about 53,000 persons), most of \nwhom (70%) are non-titleholders. Most impacts on households are minor. However, close to \n6,800 households (about 20,000 persons) need to physically relocate because they will lose their \nresidential or commercial structure. The project is expected to affect 390 community structures. \n \n35.  The RHD prepared three resettlement plans and included compensations for replacement \ncost, income-restoration measures, shifting and reconstruction assistance, special provisions for \nvulnerable households, and assistance in identifying alternative plots of land to buy or rent. The \nRHD informed the affected persons about the resettlement impacts and related entitlements, and \nconsultations will continue during implementation. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities is estimated at $256.56 million and will be financed entirely by the government, which \nhas already approved the budget. The PIU will implement the resettlement plans with support \nfrom a nongovernment organization already recruited for that purpose. The RHD is familiar and \nexperienced with ADB requirements; it is currently conducting land acquisition and resettlement \n ", "10 \nactivities for two ADB-financed projects.27 Capacity development measures for the PIU will be \nincluded as part of project inception. A resettlement framework was prepared in compliance with \nMFF modality requirements.28 Since the project will also finance the stronger safety and gender-\nresponsive features and phase 1 cost overrun, ADB conducted due diligence on the resettlement \nprocess, which confirmed the project\u2019s compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement.29 All \nsocial safeguard reports, including the entitlement matrix, are disclosed on the ADB website and \nwill be disclosed locally. A local grievance system will be put in place by the PIU. An external \nmonitor will be recruited under the associated TA to assess compliance with the Safeguard Policy \nStatement and provide guidance in the resettlement process. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples. Tranche 1 is classified category C as per the Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The alignment does not affect tribal lands, and the survey confirms that no indigenous \nperson is affected. Given that the project will be financed through an MFF, an indigenous peoples \nplanning framework was prepared and disclosed.30 \n \n37.  Environment.  Tranche  1  was  classified  category  B,  as  per  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement, since the project scope involves upgrading the existing two-lane road to four lanes \nand no environmentally sensitive areas are nearby. An initial environmental examination was \nprepared and disclosed on 18 May 2017 on the ADB website. The team carried out due diligence \non phase 1\u2019s additional financing component. The anticipated environmental impacts are mainly \nrelated to the substantial earthworks required for road embankment and expansion. Dust, noise, \nsiltation, removal of trees, and occupational health and safety issues are also expected. These \ncan  be  easily  mitigated  with  proper  engineering  measures  and  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental management plan, which will be mandatory for the contractor. Increased traffic-\nrelated emissions and noise are the expected key impacts during operation. ADB conducted \nconsultations with concerned stakeholders during project preparation in May 2013, January 2014, \nand March 2017 and will continue the consultations during project construction. A grievance \nredress mechanism was prepared to deal with concerns during project construction. \n \n38.  The PIU has adequate staff for implementing environmental safeguards but will need \ncapacity building and support for monitoring and reporting. Training and support will be provided \nby the RHD Environment and Social Circle and the project implementation consultants. An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework was prepared to provide guidance for the MFF \nand was disclosed on the ADB website on 18 May 2017.31 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n39.  The overall risk assessment is moderate without mitigation and low with mitigation. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.32 \n \n                                                \n27 Footnote 2; and ADB. 2012.

ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The government and the RHD have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n41.  The government and the RHD have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which \nare set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government \nwith respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreements for the \nrespective tranches. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the South \nAsia Subregional Economic Cooperation Dhaka\u2013Northwest Corridor Road Project, Phase 2 in an \naggregate principal amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000,000, which comprises \n(i)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; \n(ii)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, \nwith interest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s applicable \npolicies relating to ordinary capital resources; \nand is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n4 September 2017 \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nAn efficient and modern road transport system in Bangladesh achieved (Seventh Five Year Plan, \nFY2016\u2013FY2020)a \nSubregional connectivity and trade improved (Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2028     \nRoad connectivity of  Use of project roads  RHD project  Inadequate post-project \nthe Dhaka\u2013 (average daily vehicle-km  performance report  road operation and \nNorthwest  in the first full year of  maintenance. \ninternational trade  operation) reaches \ncorridor improved  8.31 million vehicle-km \n(2016 baseline: \n4.20 million vehicle-km) \nOutputs  By 2027     \n1.
