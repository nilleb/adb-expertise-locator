During discussions for the country operations business plan (COBP) 2009\u20132012,1 the \nGovernment of Mongolia sought Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to \nupdate the energy sector master plan. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy2 in promoting \nenergy sector reforms, capacity building, and governance. It will complement the energy sector \nroad map by identifying priority lending and nonlending interventions to attain sector road map \nobjectives  in  the  COBP.  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  COBP,  2009\u20132012  as  nonlending \nassistance for 2010.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The current installed power capacity in Mongolia is 1,050 megawatts (MW),4 but only \n728 MW (69%) is available because of aging power plants.5 The transmission and distribution \nnetwork,6 connecting  around  70%  of  the  population,  has  been  less  than  reliable\u2014causing \nfrequent blackouts in major cities including Ulaanbaatar\u2014mainly because of aging transmission \nlines and substation facilities. The obsolete power infrastructure has contributed to a total \nsystem loss of power supply exceeding 30%.7 The government targets reducing the total system \nloss to less than 15% by 2010. This inefficient system is coming under tremendous pressure as \nthe power demand led by the mining boom has risen consistently since 2003.8 Investment in the \npower sector has traditionally been inadequate as a result of limited state finance, moderate \ndemand growth, and uneconomical electricity tariffs inhibiting private investment. \n \n3.  The government has initiated various energy sector reforms and developments since \n2001, including sector commercialization, energy efficiency, and renewable energy diffusion. \nFurther to the Energy Law, 2001, which aimed to unbundle the energy sector9 and establish a \nsector regulatory agency,10 the government issued the Energy Sector Development Strategy \nwith Short and Long-term Action Plans, 2002\u20132010 in 2002 focusing on (i) sector restructuring, \n(ii) energy conservation, (iii) planning and operational capacity enhancement, and (iv) energy \naccess for all. The Renewable Energy Law, 2007 targets increasing the share of renewable \nenergy in total primary energy sources up to 3%\u20135% by 2010 and 20%\u201325% by 2020. In 2008, \nthe government issued the State Policy of Mongolia on Fuel and Energy, which identifies sector \nstrategies, priorities, and actions from 2008 to 2015. The priorities include (i) enhancing energy \nsecurity, (ii) improving the efficiency of the sector and creating favorable conditions for operation \nin the market environment, (iii) developing coal processing and clean coal technologies, and \n(iv) building energy exporting capacity.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 July 2010. \n4  The current energy mix is 89% coal-fired, 6.5% diesel, 3.8% hydropower, and 0.7% wind and solar power. \n5  All four major power plants operating in Mongolia have reached the end of their economic life and need urgent \nrehabilitation or replacement.   \n6  The transmission and distribution network covers 21,542 kilometers of 35\u2013220 kilovolt transmission lines and more \nthan 20,000 km of 6\u201335 kilovolt overhead lines and underground cables.  \n7  In 2009, generation loss was 16% and transmission and distribution losses were 18%. However, system loss \n(including generation, transmission, and generation loss) improved from 43% in 2001 to 34% in 2009.  \n8  Power demand since 2003 in industry, transportation, agriculture, and households have increased 31% (459.2 \nGWh), 30% (30.2 GWh), 22% (7 GWh), and 31% (174.7 GWh) respectively. The installed capacity growth has \nincreased by 53.7 MW since 2003, a modest increase (6.8%).   \n9  The single-buyer model was introduced in 2001. The monopolistic supply scheme was unbundled into seven \ngeneration companies, one transmission company, and nine distribution companies. \n10 The Energy Regulatory Authority authorizes tariff setting of heat and electricity and licensing of heat and electricity \ngeneration in Mongolia.  \n ", "2   \n \n4.  In spite of progress in policy reform and development, the state of the power sector is \nthreatening to constrain economic growth11 and may lead to serious failures with catastrophic \nconsequences for the economy and social well-being.12 While the mining boom is expected to \nprovide much needed revenues to the government for undertaking urgent investments in the \npower  sector,  the  private  sector  is  expected  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  sustaining  these \ninvestments in the long term. There is an urgent need to take stock of the existing sector \ninfrastructure, identify existing and projected critical capacity gaps over the short to medium \nterm  (2010\u20132020),  and  prepare  a  practical  investment  plan  considering  the  available  and \nanticipated public sector investment and potential private investment. In view of the above \nurgent needs, the power sector is being prioritized for ADB intervention in the proposed country \npartnership strategy (CPS), 2010\u20132015, which is being finalized.  \n \n5.  The present energy sector master plan for Mongolia, 2000\u20132020 was prepared under \ntwo ADB-supported TA projects.13 During the energy sector assessment in preparation of the \nCPS, many discrepancies were noted in the power demand forecast for 2000\u20132010, where \nactual demand grew much faster than projections. The mining boom has led to rapid economic \ngrowth\u2014the gross domestic product of Mongolia has increased by 7%\u201310% per annum since \n2003.  This  has  spurred  demand  for  electricity  that  is  far  beyond  the  high  case  growth \nassumption (4.5%\u20135.0% per annum) of the present energy sector master plan, 2000\u20132020. \nRapid economic growth beyond forecasting has also caused a mismatch between forecast \npower demand growth (2.9% per annum) and actual demand growth (4.2% per annum on \naverage). Because of this high demand pressure, the overall power plant reserve margin of the \ncentral  energy  system 14  has  fallen  below  the  required  20%.  New  large-scale  mining \ndevelopment in the South Gobi is expected to cause significant power demand15 pressure on \nthe central energy system, worsening an already critical situation.  \n \n6.  Coal  mining  development  in  the  South  Gobi  could  also  provide  an  opportunity  for \nMongolia to add power supply capacity and enhance revenues through power export via cross-\nborder power trade with the People\u2019s Republic of China.16 In 2005, the government signed \nmemorandums of understanding with the State Grid Corporation of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina,  jointly  developing  (i)  power  plants  (3,600  MW)  in  Siveovoo,  South  Gobi;  and  (ii) \ninterconnected transmission line.   \n \n                                                 \n11 From 2004 to 2007, the number of registered business entities in Ulaanbaatar nearly doubled. About 70% of the \ntotal registered business entities in Mongolia are in Ulaanbaatar, which accounts for 50% of the country\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Since 2009, approval of new business licenses has been suspended because of limited \npower supply capacity in Ulaanbaatar.  \n12 Electricity and heating are essential during the harsh winter (about 7 months per year) when the temperature drops \nto \u201340\u00b0C or lower. About 69.1% of the population (56.7% of the poor) is connected to the grid system, and 23.8% \nof the population (9.0% of the poor) is covered under the central heating system network. Because of insufficient \nreserve margin in the power system, system failure could significantly affect industry and households. \n13 ADB. 1994. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for the Power System Master Plan. Manila (TA 2095-MON, \napproved on 6 June, $595,000); ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Capacity Building for Energy \nPlanning. Manila (TA 3299-MON, approved on 17 November, $700,000). \n14 The central energy system, the largest grid system in Mongolia, covers 60% of the population and 60% of the \ncountry surface, with 840 MW installed capacity (80% of the total installed capacity) and 19,046 km of transmission \nlines (88% of total transmission lines). \n15 The South Gobi plans to be interconnected to the central energy system by 2012. Power demand in the South \nGobi is expected to grow sharply (around 400 MW) by 2020 as a result of various mining developments including \nOyu Tologoi gold and copper mine, Naryin Suhait and Ovoot Tologoi coal mines, and Tavan Tolgoi coal mine.  \n16 Mongolia  currently  imports  peaking  power  through  an  interconnected  transmission  line  from  the  Russian \nFederation.  ", "  3\n7.  In addition to the urgent capacity addition and the opportunity for cross-border power \ntrade, there is a strong need to align the sector strategies based on energy efficiency and the \nlow-carbon  development  path.  Mongolia  is  currently  the  world\u2019s  fifth  most  carbon-intense \neconomy (1,413 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per $1 million)17 and the 10th most \nenergy-intense (45,058 British thermal units per $2,000 of gross domestic product).18 As well as \nharnessing  supply-  and  demand-side  management  for  energy  efficiency,19  accelerating \nrenewable energy diffusion is a challenge. Despite high renewable energy potential, including \n175 gigawatt (GW) of solar power and 370 GW of wind power, the current installed capacity of \nrenewable energy in the total primary energy mix is only 0.7% (3 MW)\u2014far below the 25% \ntarget share of renewable energy in the mix by 2020.  \n   \n8.  The government target on energy access for all remains to be achieved. About 94% of \nthe total population has access to either grid system or stand-alone electricity supply, but \naccess  to  electricity  is  uneven  among  regions  and  households.  About  13%  of  the  rural \npopulation and 17% of the rural poor still do not have access to electricity, while only 0.5% of \nthe urban population and 1.8% of the urban poor lack access to electricity.20 Access to a reliable \nheating  service  is  another  issue.  Around  1,200  coal-fired  heat-only  boilers  have  been  in \noperation for heating supply in aimag (province) and soum (district) centers since the 1980s. \nThe  condition  of  heat-only  boilers  and  piping  systems  for  heating  supply  has  deteriorated \nbecause of aging, and their combustion efficiency is only 40%.21  \n \n9.  In view of these developments, it is urgent to analyze, refine, and update the existing \nenergy sector master plan comprehensively for 2010\u20132020. This will complement the ADB \nsector strategies in the new CPS and the ongoing support for the sector reforms, especially \nseeking private sector investment. To build investor confidence and improve private sector \ninvestment  in  the  energy  sector,  the  government  is  developing  a  legal  and  institutional \nframework  for  public\u2013private  partnership  and  preparing  an  investment  project,  which  is \ncomplemented by two ongoing ADB-financed TA projects.22  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n10.  The TA will support the government in (i) comprehensively assessing the sector to \nidentify investment gaps and the urgent reforms needed to create an enabling environment for \nsustained  sector  development,  (ii)  formulating  priority  investments  in  power  supply,  and \n(iii) enhancing the government\u2019s capacity in sector assessment and investment needs analysis.  \n \n                                                 \n17 World Resource Institute. 2009.

The impact of the TA will be improved power supply in an environmentally sustainable \nmanner. The outcome of the TA will be increased capacity in electricity and heating to meet \nadditional demand. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The key outputs of the TA include the following:  \n(i)  A policy note with recommended policies and reforms to overcome the sector's \ninvestment  constraints.  The  TA  will  conduct  a  comprehensive  energy  sector \nassessment that comprises (a) gap analysis between achievements and goals in \nthe sector policy and strategy, (b) reform option analysis including tariff and \nsector deregulation, and (c) long-term energy demand\u2013supply simulation and \nimpact analysis under several energy demand\u2013supply scenarios to identify the \noptimal investment scale in the energy sector together with feasible sector reform.    \n(ii)  A  comprehensive  sector  investment  plan,  2010\u20132020  to  identify  priority \ninvestment projects. The TA will (a) analyze the investment plan for electricity \nand heat generation, transmission, and distribution to identify the investment long \nlist,  and  (b)  develop  selection  indicators  to  identify  a  short  list  of  potential \ninvestment to prepare a comprehensive sector investment plan.  \n(iii)  Capacity development training and seminars to strengthen capacity in sector \nassessment and investment needs analysis. The TA will (a) identify core capacity \nneeds  in  energy  sector  analysis  and  planning,  and  (b)  prepare  a  capacity \nenhancement module and conduct training and seminars.  \n \n13.  The main assumptions relate to the continued economic growth led by the mining boom \nrequiring  sustained  additional  investment  in  the  sector  and  the  need  to  undertake  urgent \ninvestment projects to meet rising demand. Another assumption relates to the strong buy-in \nfrom the government to address sector needs and undertake required reforms. The critical risks \nare frequent political changes that may threaten either the priority on the investment plan or the \nproposed reforms or both. The TA design has been extensively discussed with all relevant \nstakeholders to ensure their buy-in. The TA will be implemented in a participatory manner and \nthe government will be extensively consulted in formulating the investment plan as well as \nreforms action plan so that the recommendations are practical and implementable.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The \nGovernment  of  Mongolia  will  contribute  $200,000  to  finance  the  cost  of  the  project \nimplementation unit. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.
