The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership strategies (CPSs) and related \ncountry gender assessments (CGAs)1 for the Central Asian republics (2005\u20132006) recognize that \nthere are acute gender disparities in the impacts arising from economic restructuring, agriculture \nsector reforms, and the dismantling of social services. To complement the strategies outlined in the \nCPSs and CGAs, the proposed technical assistance (TA) will identify and address obstacles to \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. The TA will be implemented in three ADB \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs): the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.2 \n \n2.  During the TA fact-finding mission, discussions with governments, development partners, \nand civil society organizations at central, provincial, and district levels confirmed the relevance of \nthe proposed activities, impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference.3 The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Women in Asia are a significant entrepreneurial force, contributing to local, national and \nregional economies and to poverty reduction, but they face different constraints and opportunities \nfrom those experienced by men. Social and cultural norms and practices can limit women\u2019s access \nto markets, resources, training, and other services. The policy environment, whether formal or \ncustomary, can constrain their access to assets and collateral. Even when formal gender equality \nexists in law, problems of implementation can result from institutional and operational weaknesses. \nComplex bureaucratic procedures can also create barriers to the formalization and growth of the \nsmall enterprises that they frequently own. \n \n4.  The CGAs for the Central Asian republics (para. 1) confirm that these conditions apply to \ntransition  economies,  and  especially  to  rural  areas,  where  the  majority  of  the  population  is \nconcentrated. The CGAs highlight the fact that, despite the high level of women\u2019s labor force \nparticipation  and  educational  achievements  in  Soviet  times,  current  conditions  at  policy, \norganizational, and community levels prevent women from benefiting fully from the opportunities \nthat transition processes present. \n \n5.  Governments acknowledge the adverse impact of economic restructuring and privatization \non women\u2019s entrepreneurship and reflect this in broad policy and legal instruments. In the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, a strategy for the development of small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) is being \ndeveloped, though not one that specifically addresses women\u2019s needs. In Tajikistan, the Gender \nEquality Law (2005) intends to guarantee women\u2019s equal access to land, financial assets, and \ncredit. In Uzbekistan, several presidential decrees have been approved, such as the decree to \nenhance the economic status of women (2004); and the decree to stimulate cooperation between \nlarge  and  small  industries  (2006),  which  grants  home  workers  the  same  rights  as  formal \nemployees. Despite the above, the policy environment suffers from the following weaknesses: (i) \nlimited enforcement of gender policies and legislation, (ii) only partial reflection of gender equality \nprinciples within agriculture and rural development sector polices and strategies, (iii) insufficient \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2005.  Country  Gender  Assessment:  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Manila;  ADB.  2006.  Country  Gender  Assessment: \nTajikistan. Manila; ADB. 2005. Country Gender Assessment: Uzbekistan. Manila. \n2  The selection of the three DMCs is based on geographic proximity, shared historical past, linguistic and cultural \ncommonalities,  similar  impact  of  economic  restructuring  and  privatization,  similar  trends  in  women\u2019s  economic \ninsecurity, and the resurgence of patriarchal values and gender-based discriminatory practices. \n3  The proposal was endorsed for funding under the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund on 11 August 2007. \nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 August 2007. \n ", "2   \norganizational mechanisms for the observance of norms of gender equality, and (iv) a weak \nstatistics base that does not allow for a breakdown of data by sex. \n \n6.  With privatization and the growth of private markets, unemployment is increasing. This has \nled to large migration outflows among men and an increasing role for women in primary crop \nproduction. However, earnings from agriculture are low and insecure, making it necessary for \nwomen to search for additional sources of income through entrepreneurial activities. Women face \nobstacles in accessing new technology and equipment; services such as credit, extension, and \ntraining; information and knowledge required to start SMEs, and the skills for financial planning. \nImposition  of  user  fees  for  services,  such  as  water,  may  also  reduce  women\u2019s  access  to \ninfrastructure and services essential for entrepreneurial activities. The CGAs summarize these \nconditions  by  stating  that  women  are  experiencing  diminishing  opportunities,  deteriorating \ncapabilities, disempowerment, and reduced security. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s CPSs for the focus countries all reflect the need and commitment to provide policy \nand program support in agriculture and natural resource management, rural development, and \nprivate  sector  development.  However,  gender  concerns  are  reflected  in  the  CPSs  to  varying \ndegrees.  For  example,  the  Uzbekistan  country  strategy  and  program  (2006\u20132010)  identifies \nimproving  women\u2019s  access  to  land  and  technology  and  stimulating  women\u2019s  entrepreneurial \nactivities as key strategic and practical choices for ADB. The Tajikistan country strategy and \nprogram (2004\u20132008), while emphasizing that rural development reduces poverty, limits gender \nconsiderations  to  an  analysis  of  women\u2019s  segregation  in  low-paying  jobs.  Similarly,  the  joint \ncountry support strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (2007\u20132010) acknowledges gender inequality and \nwomen\u2019s limited access to economic opportunities as serious issues, but does not list them among \nADB\u2019s areas of focus.  \n \n8.  The priority assigned by CPSs to agriculture and natural resource management and to rural \ndevelopment is reflected in the countries\u2019 lending portfolios. In recent loans, social and gender \nanalyses corroborate the findings of ADB\u2019s CGAs concerning (i) the discriminatory nature of some \ncustomary laws; (ii) rural women\u2019s limited livelihood opportunities and access to off-farm income-\ngenerating activities; and (iii) women\u2019s limited representation in agriculture and extension services, \ninputs, processing, and market support. The same loans try to address these problems as follows: \n(i)  the  Agriculture  Area  Development  Project  (Kyrgyz  Republic)  supports  women\u2019s  access  to \nproducers\u2019 organizations and financial services; (ii) the Land Improvement Project (Uzbekistan) \nestablishes quotas for women's representation in model farms and water users\u2019 associations; and \n(iii) the Rural Development Project (Tajikistan) supports women\u2019s access to rural business advisory \nservices, extension services, and training.4  \n \n9.  Despite  these  elements,  the  loans  in  question  (i)  do  not  address  the  policy  and \norganizational barriers to women\u2019s livelihood and entrepreneurship, (ii) tend to focus on on-farm \nactivities at the expense of off-farm activities, (iii) do not extend support to strengthening the \nnascent organizations working on women\u2019s economic empowerment and rights, and (iv) do not \nplan for knowledge creation and sharing of different gender dynamics in rural development. These \nconsiderations form the basic rationale for the approach and contents of the proposed TA. \n                                                 \n4  Technical assistance has been used to trigger niches of women\u2019s entrepreneurship in selected raions (districts). For \nexample, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction-supported project on Improving Livelihood of Women through \nDevelopment of Handicrafts Industry was explicitly designed to increase income and job opportunities for women. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  proposed  impact  of  this  regional  TA  will  be  enhanced  rural  women\u2019s  economic \nempowerment in identified raions (districts) in the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The \noutcome will be increased knowledge by ADB staff, governments, and other development partners \nabout effective ways to incorporate gender equality and women\u2019s entrepreneurship considerations \ninto  the  design  and  implementation  of  their  operations.  The  outputs  will  be  as  follows:  (i) \ncomparative analysis of major constraints to, and opportunities for, rural women\u2019s entrepreneurship \nin  agriculture-related  activities  in  the  selected  DMCs;  (ii)  policy,  organizational  capacity \ndevelopment, and strengthening of national women\u2019s associations (i.e., women\u2019s self-help groups, \ncooperatives, and nongovernment organizations [NGOs]) and networks; (iii) a portfolio of proposals \nfor  activities  to  be  funded  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners;  and  (iv)  a  publication \nsummarizing the findings of the comparative analysis and the achievements of the interventions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Activity  1:  Analysis  of  constraints  and  opportunities  for  rural  women\u2019s \nentrepreneurship. The TA will collect relevant background information on the factors that enable \nrural women to, or constrain them from, becoming effective entrepreneurs in selected subsectors \nknown for women\u2019s involvement (i.e., dairy products, dried fruits and vegetables). Information will \nbe collected from existing literature, through consultation with government, civil society, and NGO \nstakeholders;  and  from  field  research  to  be  carried  out  in  selected  raions  relevant  to  ADB \noperations. This will involve gathering baseline and other information for each country on  (i) \nwomen\u2019s self-help groups, cooperatives, and NGOs, and women\u2019s participation in SMEs in the \nproject area; (ii) changes in the gender division of labor and access to assets and benefits in \nagriculture-related activities resulting from the transition to a market economy; (iii) constraints from \nthe reemergence of patriarchal values and their influence on the status of women in the family and \nsociety;  (iv)  formal  policy,  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  related  to  women\u2019s  rural \nentrepreneurship; and (v) documentation of innovative and diverse approaches to overcoming the \ngender-related barriers to women\u2019s entrepreneurship. Identified gaps and information needs will \ninform the design of the other activities, described below. Country reports will be discussed with \nrelevant stakeholders upon completion of the activity. \n \n12.  Activity 2: Direct interventions in policy and organizational capacity development. \n \n(i)  Policy  and  organizational  capacity  development.  The  TA  will  support  the \nimprovement  of  policies  and  strategies  for  the  promotion  of  women\u2019s \nentrepreneurship in agriculture, and the development of organizational capacities of \nagencies involved in ADB operations and other strategic partners. More specifically, \nin Uzbekistan, the TA could engender the activities of the Chamber of Commerce, in \ncollaboration with the Women\u2019s Business Association, and the National Association \nof NGOs (NANNOUZ). In Tajikistan, the TA would develop the gender capacity of \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, integrating gender perspectives within its agricultural \ndevelopment  strategy  and  organizational  structure,  and  the  Small  Enterprise \nAssociation; and expand the coverage of the networks of Women\u2019s Committees at \nthe district level. Similarly, in the Kyrgyz Republic, the TA could improve the gender \ncapacity of economic and line ministries, such as the newly-established Ministry of \nEconomic Development and Trade. \n \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Strengthening national women\u2019s associations and networks. In the three DMCs, \nthe TA will support initiatives aimed at (i) strengthening women\u2019s self-help groups \nand  cooperatives  already  formed  through  social  mobilization,  to  enhance  the \nproductivity  of  their  enterprises  and  their  ability  to  access  markets,  specifically \nthrough  intensive  capacity  development  activities  and  technical  and  financial \nsupport in agribusiness processing; and (ii) supporting the capacity development of \nselected  national  women\u2019s  associations  involved  in  rural  women\u2019s  economic \nempowerment and rights in selected project areas. \n \n13.  Activity 3: Collection of proposals for funding. A portfolio of proposals for projects in \nrural areas and in sectors of interest will be compiled for possible funding by ADB and other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  proposals  will  address  barriers  to  female  entrepreneurship  in \nproduction and marketing, policies, access to equipment, and services. Proposals will be written in \nRussian and English. Selection criteria and mechanisms will be developed, which will include \nsustainability and relevance to ADB\u2019s portfolio in each country. \n \n14.  Activity 4: Dissemination of TA findings and identification of follow-up initiatives. The \nTA will assess the impact and lessons learned from Activities 1 and 2. Findings and sector-specific \nlessons learned from the supported initiatives targeting rural women will be translated into the \nrelevant languages, and widely disseminated in the DMCs. The final report will be discussed at a \nregional conference, which will aim to present findings; seek feedback from government focal \nagencies, civil society organizations, and other development partners; and plan follow-up initiatives. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000, to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund5 and  administered  by  ADB.  In  parallel  with  the \nactivities financed by ADB, the United Nations Development Programme in the Kyrgyz Republic \n(UNDP-KGZ), Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will provide financing for direct interventions (Activity 2) in \ntheir respective countries; and the Government of Switzerland will provide financing for direct \ninterventions in Uzbekistan. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. ADB\u2019s Gender, Social Development, and Civil \nSociety Division will be responsible for overall administration. It will interact closely with relevant \ndivisions in ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department, and resident missions. UNDP-KGZ will be \nretained as implementing agency for all three countries, to undertake the consulting services under \nthis project, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time), based on direct selection procedure.6 Administrative arrangements7 between \n                                                 \n5 The Governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway are contributors to the Gender and Development \nCooperation Fund. \n6  The rationale for the direct selection of UNDP-KGZ includes its (i) leading role in policy dialogue and gender-\nresponsive law reforms for promoting the status of rural women in Central Asia; (ii) long-term commitment to and \ninvolvement  in  supporting  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development  of  governments  and  women\u2019s \nassociations and networks involved in rural women\u2019s entrepreneurship; (iii) strong commitment to partner with ADB; \nand  (iv)  financial  contribution  to  the  TA  activities.  Most  specifically,  UNDP-KGZ  has  been  identified  as  the \nImplementing Agency for the TA in light of its leading role in the three selected countries, its commitment to liaise and \ncoordinate with relevant UNDP offices in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and its ability and experience to coordinate and \nmanage regional programs in the three project countries. The current limitations on international NGOs\u2019 operations in \nUzbekistan effectively mandate the direct selection of UNDP. \n7  The term \u201cadministrative arrangements\u201d refers to regulations, rules, and procedures to be used for implementation of a \nproject with respect to the following: access to information, disclosure and confidentiality policies; application of \nsafeguard policies; audit and anticorruption requirements; financial management requirements; procurement of goods \n ", "  5\nADB  and  UNDP-KGZ  will  be  finalized  in  accordance  with  the  standards,  approaches,  and \nprocedures detailed in the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between ADB and the UNDP on \n23 July 2007. The TA administrative and technical reporting requirements to be finalized and \nsubmitted by UNDP-KGZ (Appendix 3) will be in accordance with the provisions of the same MOU. \n \n17.  ADB will participate in the selection of the TA implementation team to be fielded by UNDP-\nKGZ. The Team will be composed of: 6 person-months for an international consultant (gender and \nwomen\u2019s  economic  empowerment);  84  person-months  for  five  national  consultants  (project \nmanagement, rural women\u2019s entrepreneurship and livelihood); and 12 person-months for selected \nnational women\u2019s associations (i.e., women\u2019s self-help groups, cooperatives, and NGOs). The \noutline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  national  women\u2019s \nassociations will implement direct interventions under Activity 2 and be selected based on criteria \nin Appendix 4, and terms and conditions subject to ADB approval.8 Equipment budgeted under the \nTA consists of computer and office equipment for selected national women\u2019s associations, which \nthey will retain after project completion. Funds transferred by ADB to UNDP-KGZ shall be used for \nprocurement of equipment, goods, and services from eligible ADB member countries only (para. \n22[b], MOU), which will be accomplished under open and competitive selection (para. 23[b], MOU). \nAll procurement of goods, equipment, and services using funds transferred by ADB to UNDP-KGZ \nfor the TA shall be carried out using, and in accordance with, UNDP polices, procedures, and \ndocumentation for the procurement of goods, equipment, and services as set out in the UNDP \nProcurement User Guide and as agreed upon under the MOU. \n \n18.  A Project Board will be established in the selected countries, led by UNDP-KGZ. The Board \nwill provide technical oversight to the TA implementation team on the selection of policies, capacity \ndevelopment, and direct interventions to be financed by the TA (Activity 2); and review the portfolio \nof proposals for follow-up support under the TA (Activity 3). They will serve advisory functions, and \nensure the complementarity of the TA-financed activities with ongoing initiatives and programs on \nagriculture  development,  livelihood  and  food  security,  and  land  reform.  They  will  include \nrepresentatives of sector government agencies, ADB resident missions, donor partners, women\u2019s \nbusiness associations, civil society, NGOs, and private sector entrepreneurs. Government focal \nagencies will be identified based on their current and/or potential involvement in the promotion of \nrural women\u2019s entrepreneurship. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, commencing in March 2008, with completion \ndate expected in March 2010. No activities will commence under this TA in any DMC until a letter \nof no-objection has been received by ADB from its government. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund for Promoting Rural Women\u2019s \nEntrepreneurship in Transition Economies, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                                                                                                                               \nand services (including selection of consultants); project management responsibilities and accountabilities; and public \nrecognition of support. \n8  Simplified technical proposals will be required for the proposed national women\u2019s associations. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  Women\u2019s self-help  \u2022  Government and  Assumption \nRural women\u2019s economic  groups, cooperatives,  donors\u2019 reports, private  Economic, political, and \nempowerment is  and NGOs in project area  sector, civil society,  social stability in the DMCs \nenhanced in selected  increase the number of  and NGOs\u2019 \ntransition economies  women they serve (20%  documentation \nfrom baseline) and  \u2022  Registration of self-\nrespond more effectively  help groups, \nto their needs  cooperatives, and \nNGOs in the project \narea  \nOutcome  ADB\u2019s CPS, loan, and TA  \u2022  Project documents  Assumptions \nDMC officials and ADB  documents explicitly and  \u2022  Proceedings from  \u2022  Working environment \nstaff gain knowledge  concretely address  regional conference   conducive to learning \nabout effective ways to  gender differences and  \u2022  TA final report   \u2022  Effective coordination \npromote women\u2019s  women\u2019s  among funding agencies \ncollective efforts as  entrepreneurship in the \nentrepreneurs  project countries \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
