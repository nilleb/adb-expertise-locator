INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported the decentralization of water resources \nmanagement in Indonesia from December 2007 to June 2010 through a technical assistance \n(TA) for Capacity Building in Water Resources in a Decentralized Environment,1 which aimed to \n(i) strengthen the capacity for integrated water resources management (IWRM), (ii) implement \nthe Water Law of 2004, (iii) follow up recommendations from the Capacity Building Project in the \nWater  Resources  Sector, 2  and  (iv)  build  the  capacity  of  local  government  under  the \ndecentralization policy. The TA for Capacity Building in Water Resources in a Decentralized \nEnvironment produced a draft National Strategy for Capacity Building in Water Resources \nManagement under the Water Law and 29 capacity development action plans (CDAPs) in seven \nprovinces.3 However, significant further efforts are needed to realize the endorsement of the \nnational  capacity  development  strategy  by  the  government.  In  addition,  capacity  of \ndecentralized water resources agencies (WRAs) needs strengthening to implement the Water \nLaw and the approved 29 CDAPs.   \n \n2.  In September 2010, the Government of Indonesia requested ADB to provide further \nsupport for CDAP implementation in pilot river basins, including the approval of the national \nstrategy for capacity building in decentralized WRAs. ADB considered the proposed capacity \ndevelopment TA a high priority and fielded a fact-finding mission from 21 to 24 September 2010. \nThe mission and the government concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The government promulgated the Water Law in 2004 for sustainable management of \nwater resources, but its enforcement has been hampered by gaps in human resources capacity \nin terms of the number and skill mix of staff.5 The problems are mainly the result of (i) a decade-\nlong zero-growth policy for civil servants\u2019 recruitment resulting in the shortage of well trained \nwater sector professionals; (ii) insufficient knowledge of WRAs on how to plan and implement \nIWRM; and (iii) the decentralization of public administrative responsibilities including budget and \nstaff allocation. The effective implementation of the Water Law and sector plans needs human \nresources capacity building. \n \n4.  The Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) within the Ministry of Public \nWorks  is  responsible  for  overall  water  sector  policy  guidance  in  the  country.  It  is  also \nresponsible for implementing IWRM in national river basins. DGWR prepared the necessary \ngovernment regulations, reorganized its structure to implement the Water Law, and identified \nthe human resource capacity gaps for its implementation. In 2008, the government approved \nthe regulation on water resources management6 following the Water Law, which defines and \ndescribes the roles of the WRAs.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Capacity Building in Water Resources in a \nDecentralized Environment. Manila (TA 7016-INO). \n2  ADB. 1994.

Manila. \n3  Aceh, Bali, Central Java, East Java, North Sulawesi, Papua, and West Sumatra, were selected as they were \ncovered by ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans \nto the Republic of Indonesia for Participatory Irrigation Sector Project. Manila (Loans 2064-INO[SF] and 2065-INO). \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 October 2010. \n5  This was confirmed by the ADB agriculture, natural resources, and environment sector assessment for Indonesia. \n6  Government Regulation on Water Resources Management (Peraturan Pemerintah No. 42/2008). \n ", "2   \n5.  Under the Water Law, independent WRAs providing water related services in provincial \ngovernments  were  established  within  decentralized  local  government  administrations.  The \ndecentralization provides the water sector with opportunities for local WRAs to assume their \nnew role in effective water resources management. The decentralized WRAs, however, are still \nlearning and understanding their roles under the Water Law. Specifically decentralized WRAs \nlack clarity on (i) the scope of their jurisdiction; (ii) the roles and responsibilities of national, \nprovincial, and district WRAs; and (iii) budget allocation. Clear demarcated responsibility with \ncommensurate resources, adequate incentives, and accountability for each agency within a \nclearly managed decentralized environment, are required to implement the Water Law. \n \n6.  In  response  to  these needs,  ADB provided  the  TA for  Capacity  Building  in Water \nResources in a Decentralized Environment. It assisted DGWR and the seven provinces in \npreparing CDAPs, which included performing a diagnostic analysis of each WRA, familiarizing \nthe agencies with the CDAPs, establishing a change management team, training trainers, and \ncollecting information and data. The CDAPs helped the government define its capacity building \nstrategy,  including  detailed  implementation  arrangements  and  required  funding.  The  main \nelements of a CDAP were (i) the policy framework; (ii) institutional development; (iii) human \nresource management; (iv) financial management, budgeting, and planning; (v) monitoring and \nevaluation;  and  (vi)  human  resources  development,  education,  and  training.  The  CDAPs \nreflected the new institutional roles and identified the new organizational needs of the local \nWRAs under the Water Law.  \n \n7.  The  CDAPs,  however,  have  not  been  implemented  as  the  WRAs  have  not  fully \nappreciated  the  importance  of  the  changes  in  their  roles  and  responsibilities  in  the \nimplementation of the Water Law. In addition, DGWR was unable to provide WRAs with a \nbudget for CDAP implementation. However, of the seven provinces, only Aceh and North \nSulawesi demonstrated their commitment to CDAPs.  \n \n8.  In 2010, based on the 29 CDAPs in the seven provinces, DGWR prepared a draft \nstrategy for national capacity building of WRAs with assistance from the TA for Capacity Building \nin Water Resources in a Decentralized Environment. The strategy, however, has not yet been \nendorsed by the government as further consultations and greater buy-in from stakeholders are \nneeded.  \n \n9.  In  addition  to  effective  CDAP  implementation,  the  regulation  on  water  resources \nmanagement requires that (i) the local governments should establish a river basin council in \neach river basin and (ii) all river basins have a strategic river basin framework (pola) and its \nimplementation plan (rencana) by 2011. Civil society engagement and IWRM principles are \nembedded in the regulation. This target is challenging because of the limited capacity of local \nWRAs. For example, Aceh has 11 river basins and is one of two champions in river basin \nmanagement among the seven provinces. However, it could establish only one river basin \ncouncil in the Aceh Besar river basin and prepare a pola without a rencana.  \n \n10.  A  number  of  development  partners  are  providing  complementary  and  coordinated \nsupport for the implementation of the Water Law and capacity development of WRAs. In 2011, \nDGWR prepared a human resources development master plan for itself and national WRA staff \nwith  assistance  from  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO). DGWR has recruited 40 staff in 2009 and 20 staff in 2010. The World Bank will also \nassist with the capacity development of national and local WRAs through the planned second \nphase of the Water and Irrigation Sector Management Program, which will assist 12 provinces \nin implementing their CDAPs, including the five provinces covered by the TA for Capacity \n ", "  3 \nBuilding  in  Water  Resources  in  a  Decentralized  Environment.7 In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  TA  for \nInstitutional  Strengthening  for  the  Water  Resources  Sector  will  assist  the  government  in \npreparing  a  stronger  institutional  framework  for  the  water  resources  sector.8 The  TA  will \ncomplement the World Bank support for implementing the CDAPs in other provinces. \n \n11.  To ensure the champion provinces continue to support sustainable decentralized water \nresources management, DGWR needs to communicate the strategy to relevant stakeholders to \neffect  its  implementation.  This  will  also  help  the  government  to  obtain  the  necessary \nendorsement of the strategy. Furthermore, the decentralized WRAs need to establish river basin \ncouncils, develop a pola and a rencana for each pilot river basin (as top priority activities of the \nCDAPs),  and  strengthen  their  water  resources  management  technologies  and  reporting \nsystems.    \n \n12.  The TA supports Indonesia\u2019s priorities outlined in the Medium-Term Development Plan \nfor 2011\u20132015 and is consistent with the ADB Water Policy,9 the Indonesia Country Partnership \nStrategy, 2006\u20132009,10 and the proposed new Indonesia Country Partnership Strategy, 2011-\n2013 (scheduled for approval in 2011).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be improved water resources management in Indonesia. The \noutcome  will  be  improved  capacity  of  decentralized  WRAs  for  effective  Water  Law \nimplementation.  \n \n14.  The outputs of the TA will include: (i) pilot implementation of CDAPs for pilot river basins in \nAceh and North Sulawesi,11 (ii) a national strategy endorsed for capacity building on water \nresources management, (iii) increased capacity of six pilot river basin councils in the Aceh and \nNorth Sulawesi provinces, and (iv) participatory polas and rencanas prepared for pilot river \nbasins. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will implement CDAP activities in the pilot river basins of the Aceh and North \nSulawesi provinces. The CDAP activities will be implemented based on implementation plans \nprepared by the river basin councils using a participatory approach. There is a risk of delayed \ncounterpart  budget  allocation  for  implementing  the  CDAPs,  however,  central  and  local \ngovernments have made assurances that their contributions of counterpart staff and budget will \nbe provided on time.  \n \n16.  The TA will also review the CDAPs of the seven provinces in order for DGWR to update \nand endorse the national strategy for capacity development. DGWR will consult with the seven \n                                                \n7   The five provinces are Bali, Central Java, East Java, Papua, and West Sumatra. \n8  ADB. 2010.

As all the WRAs have different statuses on river basin council, pola, rencana, and water \nresources management activities, the TA will help DGWR provide guidance to the pilot river \nbasin  organizations.  The  TA  will  also  assist  each  province  in  implementing  its  capacity \ndevelopment  activities  according  to  their  priorities.  The  TA  will  support  civil  societies\u2019 \nparticipation in the river basin councils. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2.25 million equivalent. Of this, $1.80 million will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by \nADB. The Government of Indonesia will finance the remaining $0.45 million equivalent as in-\nkind contribution for offices, remuneration, and per diem of counterpart staff, workshops, and \nreports. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The executing agency of the TA is the Ministry of Public Works and the implementing \nagency is DGWR. DGWR will implement the TA activities in close coordination with provincial \nwater resources departments. Each provincial water resources department of Aceh and North \nSulawesi will carry out priority CDAP activities in the three pilot river basins. BAPPENAS will \nfacilitate  the  consultation  on  the  draft  national  strategy  and  provide  support  for  strategy \nconsultation workshops in Jakarta. Civil society organizations will be invited to participate in the \nTA  activities,  not  only  in  the  consultation  workshops  but  also  in  the  river  basin  council \nmanagement and capacity development activities. \n \n20.  The  CDAP  implementation  in  the  Aceh  province  will  involve  the  provincial  water \nresource department, Aceh Besar river basin organization, Sumatra 1 river basin organization, \nand the Bireun district. The North Sulawesi province will also implement the CDAPs in the \nprovincial water resources department, Sulawesi 1 river basin organization, North Sulawesi river \nbasin organization, and Minahasa district. The provincial departments will support the river \nbasin councils in the pilot river basins. \n \n21.  The TA will require 132 person-months of consulting services over an implementation \nperiod of 3 years from 1 September 2011 to 31 August 2014. The consultant services include 12 \nperson-months of one international water resources planning specialist and 120 person-months \nof six national consultants, which include two specialists in Jakarta for 20 person-months each \nand  two  specialists  in  both  Aceh  and  North  Sulawesi  for  20  person-months  each.  The \nconsultants will be recruited as individuals. The outline terms of reference is in Appendix 3. All \nconsultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Any  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All \nprocured assets will be transferred to the executing agency at the completion of the TA. All \ndisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n ", "  5 \n22.  To facilitate the pilot demonstration activities of the CDAPs (Appendix 4), the advance \npayment facility shall be provided to DGWR and the provincial water resources departments in \nAceh and North Sulawesi. These agencies have sufficient capacity to complete the activity and \nliquidate  the  advances.  The  amount  of  the  advance  shall  be  based  on  the  estimated \nexpenditures for up to 6 months. The advances shall be liquidated regularly through submission \nof supporting documents. \n \n23.  The expected outputs and outcome evaluation will be disseminated through workshops \nand training courses during the TA implementation. The TA outputs and outcome evaluation will \nbe uploaded in DGWR and ADB websites for public disclosure. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n24.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,800,000 to the Government of Indonesia to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Water Resources and \nRiver Basin Management. \n  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and   \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting   \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved water  Effective Water Law  Annual reports of the  The central government \nresources  implementation in at  Directorate General  continues to provide the \nmanagement  least eight water  of Water Resources  regulatory framework for \nresources agencies  (DGWR)   integrated water resources \n(WRAs)  management. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nImproved capacity  Pilot-testing  Annual provincial  The provincial government \nof decentralized  implementation of  water resources  supports the consultants and \nWRAs for effective  WRA\u2019s capacity  reports  project activities. \nWater Law  development action     \nimplementation  plans by 2014    Intergovernmental coordination \n  on the national strategy for \ncapacity building is facilitated \nby BAPPENAS and the \nMinistry of Public Works. \n \nRisk \n \nThe establishment of river \nbasin councils is delayed. \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.

Introduction \n1.  The technical assistance consultants are envisaged to assist the Directorate General for \nWater Resources (DGWR) in (i) preparing the national strategy for capacity building strategy on \nwater resources management, and (ii) implementing capacity development action plans in the \nthree pilot river basins each in the Aceh and North Sulawesi provinces. The consultants will also \ntrain  local  water  resources  agencies  (WRAs)  on  the Water  Law,  the  regulation  on  water \nresources management, and government policy on integrated water resources management. \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n2.  Consultants for 132 person-months will be engaged individually, indicatively including 12 \nperson-months of one international water resources planning specialist, and 120 person-months \nof six national consultants, which include two specialists in Jakarta for 20 person-months each \nand two specialists for 20 person-months each in both Aceh and North Sulawesi.   \n \nTable A3: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement \n \n  Person-   Person-\nPosition  Months  Position  Months \nInternational    National   \nWater resources planning specialist/    Institutional development specialist   \nteam leader  12  (Jakarta)/deputy team leader  20 \n    Capacity development specialist (Jakarta)  20 \n    Two water resources planners  40 \n    Two institution and finance specialists  40 \n  Total  12  Total  120 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n3.  Considering the small number and limited capabilities of staff in the local WRAs, the \nconsultants need to focus on building capacity in the following major areas.  \n \n4.  Institution. Water resources infrastructure has suffered from a lack of institutional support, \nincluding operational funding. Therefore, the strategy should first be to ensure that the institutional \nand funding bases are adequate before major investments are made in new or improved technology \nsystems, including data and information systems. With the support of consultants, DGWR will \nreview the organizational needs for river basin planning, river basin leadership (coordination), water \nallocation, water quality management, and flood management. This means the national capacity \nbuilding strategy should perform the role in preparing for investment in institutional strengthening of \nWRAs.  As the institutional arrangements of national WRA, provincial WRA, and district WRA will be \ncritical factors in the implementation of the capacity development action plans (CDAPs), the team \nleader will facilitate the institutional arrangements, including the individual staff resources, before \nmobilizing the main resources of the national consultants before the inception workshop. \n \n5.  Staff.  Management  tools  have  been  introduced  in  recent  projects,  but  their  success \ndepends  very  much  on  individual  managers\u2019  motivation  to  adopt  them.  If  a  general  active \nmanagement culture is not created at the top of the organization, then management tools such as \nCDAPs and benchmarking will be performed in a mechanical way only. The general management \nenvironment has to be improved before such tools are applied. The consultants need to introduce \n ", "10      Appendix 3 \nmanagement tools selectively within programs for coordination, river basin planning, and other water \nresources issues and link them to a performance indicator reporting system for all water agencies, \nadapted as closely as possible to existing financial reporting and budgeting procedures. \n \n6.  Technology.  While water resources management principles are better understood in the \nprovinces in Java, local WRAs in other provinces have been found to possess a low level of water \nresources management or services orientation. Two priority programs follow the initiatives of DGWR \nin implementing the Water Law, namely coordination and river basin planning for newly created river \nbasin and province coordinating bodies. While a pola (strategic river basin framework) and a \nrencana (implementation plan) must be made for all river basins in Indonesia, the regulation on \nwater resources management making them sets out technical and management requirements that \ncannot be fully met at present because of a  lack of data, technical capacity, and water management \nexpertise. Lessons from water resources management projects need to be collected for training \ncapacity building, in particular integrated flood management and participatory irrigation services. \n \n7.  The integrated flood management program and participatory irrigation services have been \nprioritized and are being conducted in the pilot river basins. While flood control works have been \ndesigned and, in a few cases, flood warning and prediction information technology have been \ndeveloped, comprehensive flood coordination and management systems have not been set up. The \ninstitutional and management element is needed in addition to physical works and information \nsystems to minimize flood impacts. The strategy for integrated flood management should first be to \nensure that the institutional and funding base is adequate before major investment is made in new \nor improved technology systems, including data and information system for flood hazard mapping. \nWithin river basin planning, river basin leadership, and flood management, it is recommended to \nreview the technology needs in the support environment before deciding investments. \n \n8.  Participatory irrigation services also faced problems in the pilot river basins in (i) integrating \nchanges into the administrative practice of the provincial and district agencies, and (ii) motivating \nfarmers to take on more active roles in irrigation management. Therefore, there are questions about \nhow to improve the responsiveness of the administrators to the farmers\u2019 needs. It  may be partly \naddressed by investigating the procedural, funding, and institutional factors to improve the outputs. \nIn general, it is necessary to promote better understanding among water users and beneficiaries of \nwater services and water management, work towards the application of a service standard system \nfor  irrigation,  and  review  policies  and  procedures  to  minimize  impediments  to  water  user \nresponsibility. \n \n9.  Training  program. The  consultants  will  prepare a program for the Water  Law and \nmanagement information, which involves an initial stage to develop information and training \nmaterials  and an  implementation  stage  to  deliver  the  information  and  training.  The  target \naudiences need to be identified and enrolled before the inception workshop. The training will \nprovide  (i)  the  general  and detailed provisions  of  the Water Law and  regulations,  (ii)  the \nprinciples of water resources management, and (iii) how to implement the Water Law. The \nparticipants will include (i) staff of national WRAs, (ii) staff of provincial and district WRAs, (iii) \nstaff of other local government agencies with related roles in water resources, (iv) stakeholders \nin water resources, and (v) the general public. To suit these groups, training materials need to \nbe developed for two main audiences: (i) those with core operating responsibilities in the water \nresources sector, and (ii) those with lesser roles in the water resources sector (including the \npublic). \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 3         1   1                                                               \nC.

Institutional  development  specialist/deputy  team  leader  (national,  20  person-\nmonths). The consultant should have a university degree in water resources engineering and at \nleast  15  years  of  experience  in  water  resources  management  projects  in  Indonesia.  The \nconsultant, located in Jakarta, will be responsible for assisting the team leader in preparing an \ninstitutional strengthening action plan for integrated river basin management and a national \nstrategy for provincial water resources agencies, and assessing the performance indicators of \nriver basin organizations by using the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations performance \nindicators at the inception stage in 2011 and the final report stage in 2014. The consultant will \nalso monitor the performance of the national consultants, including water resources planners \nand water resources institutional specialists working in the provinces. The consultant should \nintroduce management tools and systems to organizations where there is a general management \nprogram for the whole of the organization, or where the tools are to be introduced as a formal \nrequirement. New procedures should be supported and approved by DGWR and by the head of the \norganizations before being implemented within the organizations. Direct dealing with the head of the \nWRA is an essential part of any program to develop and improve that organization; and that a \nprogram must be initiated to inform and educate water resources stakeholders and the public on \nwater services and water management. Institutional structures, budgets, and changes to procedures \nto facilitate improved water sector performance should be introduced as required. The consultant \nwill  prepare  monthly  progress  reports  and  a  special  report  on  procedures  for  river  basin \nmanagement for river basin councils and local WRAs by February 2012.  \n \n ", "12      Appendix 3 \n12.  Capacity development specialist (national, 20 person-months).  The consultant should \nhave a university degree in water resources engineering and at least 15 years of experience in \nwater resources management projects in Indonesia. The consultant, to be located in Jakarta, \nwill be responsible for assisting the team leader in assessing training needs in integrated river \nbasin  management  and  institutional  strengthening  action  plans  for  integrated  river  basin \nmanagement, and implementing capacity building activities. An early program in the capacity \nstrategy needs to apply performance indicators for river basins and WRAs, which were implemented \nin river basin institutional benchmarking. The agreed performance indicators should be integrated \nwith annual reporting and budget submissions by WRAs. Investments in technical hardware and \nsoftware need to be contingent on developing appropriate funding, procedural, and staff incentive \nconditions. The consultant will develop training materials on the Water Law and regulations, the \nprinciples of water resources management, and the implementation of the Water Law in provincial \nand district governments. An initial 2-year phase of the capacity strategy will be implemented and, at \nthe end of that period, the task force will review all programs and advise how the second phase \nshould continue. The consultant will prepare monthly progress reports, a training need assessment \nreport, and training materials for (i) the general and detailed provisions of the Water Law and \nregulations, (ii) the principles of water resources management, and (iii) the implementation of \nthe Water Law. \n \n13.  Water  resources  planner  (two  national, 20  person-months each).  The  consultants \nshould each have a university degree in water resources engineering and at least 10 years of \nexperience in water resources management projects in Indonesia. The responsibility of the \nconsultants, one to be located in the Aceh province and one in North Sulawesi province, will be \nto (i) act as provincial team leader, (ii) identify priority reforms in provincial water resource \ndatabase management, (iii) guide a situation and gaps analysis of the integrated river basin \nmanagement, (iv) review river basin frameworks and implementation plans to identify issues to \nbe  addressed  by  the project,  (v)  support  water  resources  conservation activities,  and  (vi) \nevaluate  and  monitor  capacity  building  activities  on  water  resources  management.    The \nconsultant will prepare monthly progress reports and a provincial water management report to \nrecommend priority CDAP activities for each pilot river basin, including establishing river basin \ncouncils, preparing river basin strategic frameworks and implementation plans, and allocating \nthe budget for improved water resources management. \n \n14.  Institution  and  finance  specialist  (two  national,  20  person-months  each).  The \nconsultants should each have a university degree in water resources engineering or economics \nand at least 10 years of experience in water resources management projects in Indonesia. The \nconsultants, one located in the Aceh province and one in the North Sulawesi province, need to \nhave strong institutional skills, with nontechnical change management, and capacity building \nexperience  to provide  complementary  skills.  The  consultants  will  train  the WRA  staff and \nstakeholders on the Water Law and regulations, and assist the provincial water resources \ndepartment in supporting the selected provincial water resources councils. The consultants will \nsupport civil society stakeholders, who represent, together with private sector representatives, \n50% of the representatives under the Water Law. Capacity development programs to civil \nsociety organizations in the pilot river basins should ensure their full participation in the water \nresources  councils  for  nonstructural  river  basin  management.  The  consultants  will  be \nresponsible for assisting the provincial water resources planner/team leader in preparing an \ninstitutional reform report for the provincial water resources management. The consultants will \nprepare monthly progress reports and an institutional reform report of the provincial river basin \nmanagement in administration, financial management, and capacity building aspects. \n \n ", "    Appendix 4  13\nPILOT IMPLEMENTATION OF CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN \n \nA.  Capacity Development \n \n1.  The capacity development process has three essential phases: \n \n(i)  Performance analysis. Identify performance gaps that the organization wished to \naddress. \n(ii)  Capacity diagnostic analysis. Identify the factors leading to the organizational \ngaps. \n(iii)  Strategy development. Based on the diagnostic analysis, develop strategies to \naddress factors that constrain capacity. \n \n2.  The evaluations of the Asian Development Bank of a number of capacity development \ntechnical assistance projects indicate that such a systematic capacity development process is \noften not followed because of (i) development partners\u2019 bias toward pre-favored interventions, \nand  (ii)  lack  of  capacity  development  capability  of  consulting  firms  working  on  capacity \ndevelopment programs. Capacity development investments will not be optimum unless a prior \nholistic, systematic, and rigorous capacity analysis, led by and involving key stakeholders in the \norganization, has already been carried out. \n \n3.  The capacity development process (strategy, pace, and sequencing) must be led by the \norganization, with help from consultants when needed. The consultant facilitator can provide a \nroad  map,  help  to  avoid  barriers,  monitoring  and  feedback,  and  experience  from  lessons \nlearned. Training can be cost effective and add learning to the process. Internal ownership, \nfostered from leading and participating in performance and diagnostic analysis, will lead to \nsustainability. \n \nB.  Capacity Development Action Plan \n \n4.  Capacity development action plans (CDAPs) for water resources management will help \ngovernments define their capacity building strategy, detailed programs, and required funding. \nThe main elements of a CDAP are (i) policy framework; (ii) institutional development; (iii) human \nresource management; (iv) financial management, budgeting, and planning; (v) monitoring and \nevaluation; and (vi) human resources development, education, and training. \n \n5.  A CDAP must cover a period of implementation to deliver meaningful benefits. It was \ndesigned  as  a  medium-term  action  plan,  broken  down  into  annual  action  agendas  and \ninvestment and recurrent budgets. The process of CDAP formulation is summarized as follows: \n \n(i)  Needs assessment and diagnostic analysis. The local CDAP team maps out \nexisting capacity problems and priority actions, and develops strategies in the \nmain  elements  in  paragraph  4.  This  is  done  through  intensive  consultation \nbetween  various  state  and  non-state  agencies,  including  civil  society \norganizations. \n(ii)  Drafting of relevant components of the CDAP. This includes scheduling short- \nand medium-term measures and the provision of technical backstopping. \n(iii)  Present the draft CDAP for consultation among relevant local agencies. \n(iv)  Develop the CDAP budget through consultation between the CDAP team, the \nlocal financial agency, and the local parliament budgetary commission. \n(v)  The draft CDAP is reviewed by the support team at the national level. \n ", "14      Appendix 4 \n \nC.  Capacity Development Action Plans under the TA for Capacity Building in Water \nResources in a Decentralized Environment  \n \n6.  Under  ADB\u2019s  TA  for  Capacity  Building  in  Water  Resources  in  a  Decentralized \nEnvironment,1 the Directorate General for Water Resources prepared 29 CDAPs in December \n2009  through  (i)  project  dissemination  workshops  in  eight  provinces,  (ii)  assessment  and \ndiagnostic analysis in the 41 water resources management institutions within the provinces, (iii) \ntraining of trainers, (iv) preparation of CDAPs, (v) a provincial workshop in each province, and \n(vi) a national workshop. This TA also prepared the guidelines for facilitating institutional self \nassessment  for  CDAP  preparation.  The  CDAP  covers  the  activities  of  policy,  institutional \nstrengthening, human resources management, finance, technical water resources management, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and human resources development for the river basin organization \nand provincial and district water resources agencies. \n \n7.  All  the  participating  institutions,  except  those  in  South  Kalimantan,  submitted  their \nCDAPs and had a provincial workshop with all the participating institutions in the province to \nconduct peer review of these plans. The institutions in South Kalimantan failed to submit the \nCDAPs because of their routine workload. The CDAPs showed that the number of activities for \neach  WRA  ranged  from  6  to  99  because  of  differences  in  (i)  understanding  of  change \nmanagement  team  and  the  working  units  on the  purpose  and  role of  the  CDAP for  their \ninstitution; (ii) commitment of the head of the institutions; (iii) capacity of each institution to \nidentify their problem, needs, and strategy; and (iv) time constraints. \n \n8.  The CDAP budget was estimated at $35.182 million for 948 activities, including national \nriver basins of $8.576 million, provincial river basins of $11.230 million, and district river basins \nof $15.376 million. The two pilot provinces of Aceh and North Sulawesi were selected as \nchampions for water resources management during the final workshop of the TA for Capacity \nBuilding  in  Water  Resources  in  a  Decentralized  Environment.  They  have  the  179  CDAP \nactivities that are estimated at $12.305 million, with 55 activities in Aceh estimated at $4.839 \nmillion for Aceh and 124 activities estimated at $7.466 million for North Sulawesi. \n \nD.  Pilot Demonstration of Capacity Development Action Plans \n \n9.  The Aceh province prepared the CDAPs for the national river basin organization of \nSumatra 1, the provincial water resource department, the river basin organization of Aceh Besar, \nand the district government of Bireun. The North Sulawesi province prepared the CDAPs for the \nnational river basin of Sulawesi 1, the provincial water resources department of North Sulawesi, \nand  the  district  government  of  Minahasa.  Those  river  basin  organizations,  provincial \ndepartments, and district governments will pilot demonstrate their CDAP activities.  \n \n10.  Each provincial water resources department will assist in (i) establishing and facilitating \na water resources council for each river basin, (ii) preparing a pola and a rencana for each river \nbasin, and (iii) supporting training as a priority human resources development activity, which \nfocuses on institution, staff, and water resources technology. The detailed CDAP implementation \nplan will be prepared during the inception workshop. The consultants will evaluate and monitor \nthe capacity development activities. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2007.
