INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) for the Master Plan for Road \nConnectivity will help enhance the planning and programming of transport sector investments in \nNepal by supporting the (i) development of the national highway network (NHN) expansion plan, \n(ii) preparation of the priority investment plan (PIP) for 2023\u20132033, and (iii) capacity building of \nthe Department of Roads (DOR). \n \n2.  This TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Nepal, and its objective is identified as one of the three pillars in \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2020\u20132024: improved infrastructure by supporting road \ntransport and logistics to strengthen domestic, regional, and international connectivity.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Country context. Nepal is landlocked, bordered to the north by the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and to the east, south, and west by India. The country is divided into three physiographic \nareas: the mountains in the north, the hill and Siwalik regions in the middle, and the Terai (lowland \nplains)  bordering  India  in  the  south.  In  February  2021,  the  United  Nations  Committee  for \nDevelopment Policy recommended Nepal\u2019s graduation from the least-developed country category \nafter a preparatory period of 5 years, to be effective in 2026.2 \n \n4.  Transport sector in Nepal. Transport connectivity in Nepal is a challenging and costly \nundertaking because of its natural terrain and geography. The transport sector comprises roads, \naviation, railways, inland waterways, and ropeways. Road transport is by far the dominant mode \nand, along with air travel, is considered the major mode of transport for freight and passengers. \nAviation plays an important role in maintaining international connectivity but the country\u2019s terrain \nas well as inadequate technology and operational skills are constraining its expansion. The \ntransport movement through waterways and ropeways is negligible, whereas the railway network \nis being examined for expansion with bilateral support from India and the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n5.  Existing road networks. Road transport carries about 90% of freight and passenger \ntraffic in Nepal and is considered the only mode of transport in Kathmandu Valley.3 Previously, \nthe road network was classi\ufb01ed as strategic road network (SRN) or local road network.4 The SRN, \nwhich consisted mainly of national highways and feeder roads, was reconfigured into 80 national \nhighways and presented as NHN in the Statistics of National Highway 2020/21 in May 2021.5 The \nNHN, covering about 14,923 kilometers (km), is under the jurisdiction of the DOR and serves as \nthe backbone for the physical and economic integration of the country, and of Nepal with its \nneighbors. However, less than half of these highways have bituminous pavements, which makes \nroad maintenance a huge challenge. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Nepal, 2021\u20132023. Manila; ADB. 2019. Country Partnership \nStrategy: Nepal, 2020\u20132024\u2014Promoting Connectivity, Devolved Services, and Resilience. Manila. The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 June 2021. \n2  United Nations. 2021. The United Nations Committee for Development Policy Plenary 2021. New York. \n3  The Kathmandu Valley covers the districts of Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, and Lalitpur. \n4  The local road network comprises district roads, village roads, and other minor roads with a total length of more than \n57,500 km; the jurisdiction is about to be devolved from the Department of Local Infrastructure to provincial and local \ngovernment agencies. \n5 Government of Nepal, DOR. 2021. Statistics of National Highway 2020/21. Kathmandu. About 3,734 km out of 14,923 \nkm are under construction and/or planned. \n ", "2 \n6.  The DOR\u2019s strategic roads are maintained mainly through the DOR\u2019s own support capacity, \nwhich plans and carries out routine maintenance, recurrent maintenance, periodic maintenance, \nand  emergency  maintenance.  The  practice  of  performance-based  road  maintenance  was \nintroduced in Nepal in 2003. The Roads Board Nepal was set up in 2002 with the aim of providing \nsustainable funding for planned road maintenance. However, funding has not been sufficient to \ncarry out periodic maintenance successfully. The 2007 PIP (paras. 12\u201313) showed that Nepal \nwas  losing  $1  billion  equivalent  in  vehicle  operation  and  rehabilitation  because  of  lack  of \nmaintenance works. The DOR still needs to fully establish an efficient road asset management \nsystem.6 In addition to the yearly maintenance budget, the DOR has proposed to earmark an \nannual budget for periodic maintenance of the core road network (CRN) to be funded by the \nMinistry of Finance for the Roads Board Nepal.7 \n \n7.  Intermodal transport connection is inadequate in the country. Although the current NHN \nhas provided connections to airports, nearly 85% of goods traded are transported by land and \nstrongly rely on the Kathmandu\u2013Birgunj\u2013Kolkata Corridor and the East\u2013West Highway. The \nBirgunj inland clearance depot is the only terminal that has rail and road connectivity with India. \n \n8.  Sector road map. The transport sector is guided by the (i) National Transport Policy, 2002; \n(ii) Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport (MOPIT), 2016\u20132020; \n(iii) sector-wide PIP; (iv) the government\u2019s Fifteenth Plan, fiscal year (FY) 2020\u2013FY2024; and \n(v) South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  Operational  Plan,  2016\u20132025 \nUpdate.8 The government\u2019s 15th plan emphasizes the need to strengthen the transport sector, \nparticularly road management capacity, with modern technologies and knowledge transfer. \n \n9.  The current sources of funding are primarily the annual budget allocation and assistance \nfrom  development  partners.  External  assistance  for  SRN  development  was  up  by  41%  in \nFY2017.9 The MOPIT envisaged expenditures on roads of NRs620 billion during 2016\u20132020. This \nspending has spilled beyond 2020 due to budgetary constraints and implementation delay. \n \n10.  Institutional arrangements. The DOR is the main agency responsible for the planning, \ndesign, operation, and maintenance of the NHN, or the former SRN, across Nepal. The DOR has \neight sub-branches including planning and monitoring, maintenance, and bridge. The planning \nand monitoring branch formulates the plan and budget for investment, monitors progress of projects, \nand is in charge of the road safety program. The maintenance branch is responsible for coordinating, \nsupervising, monitoring, and evaluating all maintenance activities of roads under the DOR\u2019s jurisdiction \nand will be accountable for the future road asset management unit. \n \n11.  Road networks and investment plans. First developed in 1995, the SRN consisted of \n15 national highways and 51 feeder roads. It was designed to provide connectivity to all district \nheadquarters and to enable balanced regional growth in an efficient and cost-effective manner. \nAdditional feeder roads were proposed in the first PIP in 1997, when large areas of the country \nwere not accessible for motorized traffic, which was followed by a program of staged construction. \n \n6  ADB. 2013.

Washington, DC. \n ", "3 \n12.  In 2007, a detailed study of accessibility provided by the SRN recommended progressive \nexpansion. A second PIP (2007 PIP) was formulated for a 10-year period, with a maintenance \nstrategy based on an analysis of the condition of the existing and committed SRN sections using \nthe  fourth  highway  development  and  management  model  (HDM-4).  The  government  then \nexpanded the SRN beyond the committed level  by including additional links with strategic \npotential that were presented in later SRN maps. \n \n13.  A midterm review of the 2007 PIP was carried out in 2016 that extended the plan up to \nFY2022. The review also found that many of those additional SRN links were unsealed local roads \nor connected to areas with small populations. Resources were shared with these roads and other \nsmall projects. The strategic functions of these roads and the actual demand for them over the \nyears shall be reviewed, and any proposed works should be determined independently. \n \n14.  The NHN is replacing the SRN and remains under the DOR\u2019s jurisdiction. The principal \nresponsibility for the development and management of the NHN is vested with the DOR under \nthe aegis of the MOPIT. As the current PIP is expiring, an up-to-date study is required to identify \n \nnew critical projects and estimates for future resource allocation.\n \n15.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The TA will contribute mainly to achieving three \noperational  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030:  (i)  address  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities, (ii) promote rural development and food security, and (iii) foster regional cooperation \nand integration. This will be achieved by supporting the NHN expansion to improve Nepal\u2019s \ndomestic and regional connectivity and to boost economic growth.10 The TA will also strengthen \nthe  DOR\u2019s  governance  and  institutional  capacity  so  it  can  identify  and  implement  quality \ninfrastructure investments more effectively, efficiently, and accountably. Gender equality will be \nassured by the participation of women staff in capacity training. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s contribution to transport in Nepal. ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \nNepal, 2021\u20132023 (para. 2) targets more reliable, sustainable, and resilient transport infrastructure. \nADB is a leading partner in Nepal's transport sector and has financed five projects in 2010\u20132019 to \nimprove about 1,300 km of the NHN (formerly SRN), for $885.8 million. ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in \nthe sector include improving access and mobility to enhance cities\u2019 livability and expanding multimodal \ntransport systems in the context of competitive economic corridors. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: road network connectivity in Nepal improved.11 \nIt will have the following outcome: planning and programming of roads in Nepal improved.12 To \nmanage the rapid increase in registered vehicles and traffic demand, and to promote continuous \ninvestment in roads, the NHN and PIP need to be reevaluated, updated, and used strategically in \ntransport planning. The NHN and all associated investments (new construction, rehabilitation, and \nmaintenance) need to be aligned with SASEC and the government\u2019s transport policy and strategy. \nThe TA will provide strong support for investment decision-making in the sector. \n \n \n \n10 ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n11 Defined by the TA. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n18.  Output  1:  Development  of  Nepal\u2019s  national  highway  network  expansion  plan \nsupported. The TA aims to support the expansion of the NHN to improve the country's domestic \nand regional connectivity. The TA team will \n(i)  review and assess the existing traffic data and traffic demand; \n(ii)  conduct surveys of passenger and cargo traffic showing the origin and destination \nof movements along the roads of study; \n(iii)  conduct a holistic review of the development plan of other modes of transport, such \nas urban transport (for Kathmandu Valley), aviation, rail, and inland waterways, \npaying particular attention to the promotion of the intermodal transport system; \n(iv)  review and incorporate relevant sector plans, such as the SASEC economic \ncorridor investment plan; \n(v)  prepare traffic volume forecasts for the NHN, and conduct network modeling with \nvarious strategies; \n(vi)  propose potential new roads to be added to the NHN and non-important roads to \nbe excluded from it, while considering environmental and social sensitivity, and \nclimate and disaster risk aspects; and \n(vii)  review the road inventory and database, and produce road data for new segments. \n \n19.  Output 2: Preparation of Nepal\u2019s priority investment plan for 2023\u20132033 supported. \nThe TA team aims to propose an investment plan to support the expansion of the NHN, and will \n(i)  review  and  collect  data,  e.g.,  vehicle  operating  costs,  construction  and \nmaintenance costs, and road data for analysis using HDM-4; and forecast different \nmaintenance budget scenarios;13 \n(ii)  determine an optimal investment plan, with balanced considerations including but \nnot limited to (a) new roads, or upgrade, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the \nNHN; (b) resource allocation based on geographic regions and road classification; \n(c) economic viability; and (d) environmental and social sensitivity, and climate and \ndisaster risks; \n(iii)  compare  different  budget  scenarios  and  determine  suitable  investments  in \nconstruction and maintenance in light of local resources and absorptive capacity \nconstraints, and probable foreign assistance in road transport from 2023 to 2033; and \n(iv)  propose an appropriate PIP and budget for the NHN for 2023\u20132033. \n \n20.  Output 3: Department of Roads\u2019 capacity on transport sector planning enhanced. \nThe TA aims to strengthen the capacity of the DOR to plan and prioritize investments in the sector. \nThe TA team will \n(i)  train 15 DOR engineers in network planning and maintenance using HDM-4, and in \ndata analysis and presentation through the geographic information system;14 and \n(ii)  conduct knowledge transfer sessions on road network modeling. \n \n21.  The TA encourages the DOR to consider environmental and social sensitivity, and climate \nand disaster risks in the planning of infrastructure projects, and during the formulation of the NHN \nexpansion plan and the PIP. \n \n13 HDM-4 is a software tool for the analysis, planning, management, and appraisal of road maintenance, improvements, and \ninvestment decisions. It has been widely used (by ADB and the World Bank) to conduct economic analyses of road projects. \n14 The geographic information system has been widely used to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, visualize, \nand present all types of data associated with geographic locations. \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,725,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n \n23.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff; access \nto TA-relevant data, information, and maps; staff time to review the outputs of consultants; \nnecessary  coordination  with  stakeholder  agencies;  staff  support  for  organizing  committee \nmeetings, workshops, and training sessions; and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.
