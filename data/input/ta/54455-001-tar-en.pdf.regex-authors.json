INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  business \ndevelopment activities relating to the identification, preparation, and processing of a pipeline of \nprivate sector high-level technology renewable energy projects. The TA will focus on Southeast \nAsian developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), especially \nCambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, and Viet Nam, as well \nas  Indonesia,  and  the  Philippines.  The  TA  will  cover  next-generation  renewable  energy \ntechnologies,  including;  offshore  wind,  green  hydrogen1,  tidal  and  wave  energies,  hybrid \nprojects  combining  multiple  technologies,  floating  solar,  integrated  renewable  energy  and \nenergy  storage,  grid  or  distribution-level  energy  storage,  other  next-generation  solar  or \nrenewable  energy  technologies,  and  smart  grid technologies  (including  demand  response). \nSome of these technologies may have been proven in other markets but have not yet been \ndeployed at sufficient scale within ADB\u2019s DMCs, or within the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) \nportfolio. 2  The  TA  will  involve  preliminary  desk-based  market  analysis;  client  outreach; \npreliminary  screening  of  project  opportunities;  development  of  an  investment  pipeline;  and \npreparation  of  further  funding  applications,  project  structuring,  and  ADB  processing.  This \napproach is consistent with the scope for a knowledge and support TA activity because it \ninvolves a sector-specific search for potential transactions and inputs for project preparation and \nprocessing. This TA will help build the capacity of ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department \n(PSOD) to identify and process next-generation renewable energy transactions. Opportunities \nfor a One ADB approach will be pursued where possible. This could include supporting Office of \nPublic\u2013Private  Partnership  initiatives,  or  working  with  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  and  the \nSustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department  on  particular  technologies  or \ntransactions. \n \n2.  The proposed TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which identifies power as the \nlargest infrastructure gap for Asia and the Pacific and includes a strong emphasis on climate \nchange. Promoting investment into next-generation renewable energy projects will support the \ncommitments to reduce emissions that ADB\u2019s DMCs have made under the Paris Agreement. \nThe  TA  is  also  strongly  aligned  with  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  3 (tackling  climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability) \nand with the following ADB country operations business plans (COBPs).3 \n(i)  COBP for Cambodia, 2021\u20132023, which supports the promotion and expansion \nof renewable energy; \n(ii)  COBP  for  Indonesia,  2021\u20132023,  which  supports  inclusive,  competitive,  and \nsustainable development in Indonesia, and which will explore opportunities for \nnonsovereign investments; \n(iii)  COBP for the Lao PDR, 2020\u20132022, which focuses on infrastructure and private \nsector development;   \n \n(iv)  COBP for the Philippines, 2020\u20132022, which has a strong focus on infrastructure \ninvestment and urbanization to respond to local climate change adaption; \n \n1  Green hydrogen is hydrogen that is produced using renewable energy. \n2  Climate Investment Funds, CTF Trust Fund Committee. 2017.

ISSUES \n \n3.  Energy  demand  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  has  increased  rapidly  alongside  economic \ngrowth. In 2016, the region accounted for 48% of global carbon dioxide emissions from the \nenergy sector.4 Fossil fuel subsidies still exist in many Asian countries, and Asia remains the \nlargest region globally for planned, under-construction, or operational coal-fired power plants.5 \nFossil fuel use within the energy sector also causes air pollution, which contributes to growing \nenvironmental  pressures  and  poses  challenges  to  sustainability,  exacerbating  existing \nvulnerabilities of underprivileged groups. \n \n4.  Current levels of investment in climate mitigation and adaptation in Asia  and the Pacific \nare  insufficient  to  meet  climate  goals.  ADB  estimates  that  meeting  climate-adjusted \ninfrastructure needs in Asia and the Pacific region will require $26 trillion of investment from \n2016 to 2030.6 The impacts from climate change already impose significant costs in Asia and \nthe Pacific. Reducing the region\u2019s emissions will help reduce the severity of future climate \nimpacts and support a more sustainable development pathway. \n \n5.  The United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal 7 highlights the urgent need to \nincrease  renewable  energy  use  and  reduce  the  energy  sector\u2019s  reliance  on  fossil  fuels. \nTransitioning to a green and climate-resilient economy is paramount to ensure that DMCs can \nreduce their greenhouse gas emissions and better hedge against climate change risks. The \nWorld Energy Outlook 2020 of the International Energy Agency (IEA) points out that although \npolicy,  regulation,  and public  finance  will  be  critical  to  give momentum to  a  clean  energy \ntransition, most of the investment will need to come from the private sector.7 \n \n6.  The  IEA  sustainable  development  scenario for  the  power  sector  estimates that  the \ncarbon intensity of electricity generation in Southeast Asia will need to fall from about 571 grams \nof carbon dioxide in 2018 to 118 grams by 2040.8 Although progress has been made globally in \nthe deployment of onshore wind and solar technologies, deploying renewable energy at the \nscale required to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement will likely require a variety of \nnext-generation technologies. The installation of some of these technologies, such as offshore \nwind and battery energy storage, remain very nascent in Southeast Asia. \n \n7.  Various factors inhibit the deployment of next-generation renewable energy technologies \nwithin the target countries for this TA, such as; increased first mover costs, lengthy project \npreparation  cycles,  lack  of  government  support,  weak  enabling  environments,  insufficient \ntechnical knowledge, and a lack of data on the potential resource. As a result, there remains a \n \n4  ADB. 2018.

The ongoing global energy transition offers the chance to create new jobs for women in \nscience,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  fields,  and  to  reshape  how  energy  is \nproduced and distributed to benefit all genders.9 Globally, renewable energy employs about 32% \nwomen,  compared  to  22%  in  the  energy  sector  overall.  Still,  within  renewables,  women\u2019s \nparticipation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics jobs is far lower than in \nadministrative jobs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  proportion  of  power  produced  from \nrenewable energy sources in the power generation mix increased and emission intensity per \nunit of gross domestic product reduced. The TA will have the following outcome: investment into \nthe deployment of next-generation renewable energy technologies increased.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Thematic and gender-sensitive research and due diligence is conducted \non certain next-generation renewable energy technologies and transactions. Research will \nbe carried out internally, or commissioned from individuals or firms, to understand technological \nrisk, resource risk, credit or business model risk, regulatory risk, and other factors that can \nimpact project development and bankability for next-generation renewable energy technologies. \nOther factors could include an assessment of the research gaps relating to the bankability of \nnew technologies and, where required, market and gender assessments, private and public \nsector outreach (including existing and potential clients), and reviews of existing literature and \nwork being undertaken within ADB or by other multilateral banks or organizations. This output \nwill help identify a pipeline of opportunities for further nonsovereign processing. \n \n11.  Output 2: Funding applications are prepared, or project structuring, due diligence, \nand  processing  with  gender  additionality  is  undertaken.  Applications  or  investment \nproposals will be prepared for internal or external concessional finance or other climate finance \nsources, and for internal ordinary capital resources processing and approval. More detailed due \ndiligence will be undertaken at this stage, including analysis that enables gender measures to \nbe identified and incorporated into each project at the time of processing. For energy projects, \ngender elements often include targets for employment, policies, or procurement. During project \nprocessing, the PSOD\u2019s gender specialists will be part of the project team and will help identify \nand incorporate appropriate measures. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Technology  or  sector  gender-inclusive  reports  or  case  studies  are \ndisseminated. ADB will publish reports or case studies on a particular technology, sector, or \ntransaction to disseminate knowledge. To the extent possible, the production and dissemination \nof the reports will apply a gender lens including sex-disaggregated data gathering, gender-\n \n9  International Renewable Energy Agency. 2019.

This  will  be  limited  to \nnonconfidential information or information otherwise approved for public disclosure. \n \n13.  Outputs  1\u20133  will  focus on  business  development,  including  screening opportunities, \nunderstanding  the  barriers  to  private  sector  participation  and  investment,  disseminating \nknowledge,  conducting outreach to  clients,  sourcing funding,  and  structuring  and  financing \ntransactions. \n \n14.  With  the  incorporation  of  gender  considerations  across  the  proposed  pipeline \ndevelopment  activities,  the  TA  corresponds  to  the  effective  gender  mainstreaming \ncategorization. \n \n15.  TA is proposed because of the emerging nature of the technologies identified in para. 1. \nBecause the technologies are still emerging in ADB\u2019s DMCs, the pipeline of potential projects is \nstill nascent and will require a combination of focused business pipeline development, due \ndiligence, research, and capacity development, in addition to project processing.11 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Clean Technology Fund and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department confirmed that the TA \nproject\u2019s scope is consistent with the ADB proposal submitted to the CTF Trust Fund Committee \nand approved in April 2018.12 Technologies and countries selected are deliberately broad to \nallow  flexibility  to  respond  to  private  sector  opportunities  during  implementation.  The  CTF \nrequest for proposals for its Business Development Facility (BDF) stated that: \n \nThe purpose of the BDF is to provide funding to support [multilateral development \nbanks]  and  countries  to  develop  project  pipelines  to  be  financed  by  multiple \nsources of climate finance. The BDF will target sectors and innovative projects \nthat face challenges to access climate finance or projects and programs that will \ntake an extended time to develop.13 \n \n18.  This TA will focus on Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, as well as \nIndonesia, and the Philippines, which are all CIF-eligible countries. The scope will  include \npotential cross-border or regional integration and cooperation projects, to the extent they involve \nnext-generation renewable energy technologies. Additional Climate Investment Funds (CIF)-\neligible countries that are also ADB DMCs may also be covered, such as Armenia, Bangladesh, \n \n11 The TA will complement other TA projects such as ADB. 2015.
