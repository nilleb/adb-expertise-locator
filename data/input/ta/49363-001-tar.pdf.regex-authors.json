INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In August 2015, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to support reducing the economic disparities between the \neastern,  central,  and  western  subregions  of  the  Yangtze  River.  During  a  reconnaissance \nmission  in  October  2015,  an  agreement  was  reached  on  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  and  estimated  budget  for  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening \nProvincial Planning and Implementation for the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB).1 The \nsupport would help implement the Guidelines on Promoting the Development of the Yangtze \nRiver Economic Belt Building on the Golden Waterway, which was issued by the State Council \nin 2014; and the Economic Development Plan for the Yangtze River Economic Belt, which is \nexpected to be issued by the end of 2015.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The government identified the YREB as one of three key growth engines to ensure the \nPRC\u2019s future economic development. The corridor along the PRC\u2019s longest river covers more \nthan 2 million square kilometers\u2014one-fifth of the country\u2019s total area. This economic backbone \naccounts for over 40% of the PRC\u2019s total population and about 45% of the gross domestic \nproduct. The Yangtze River, one of the busiest inland rivers for freight traffic worldwide, is home \nto the largest hydropower plant in the world and is the source of water for the South\u2013North \nWater Transfer Project. Ten provinces and one municipality make up the Yangtze economic belt \nsubregion, which includes three major urban agglomeration areas: (i) the Yangtze River Delta \nGlobal Mega Agglomeration focused on Shanghai, (ii) the Middle Yangtze City Cluster centered \nin Wuhan, and (iii) the Yangtze Upper Reaches centered in Chongqing.  \n \n3.  Development constraints include (i) limited overall institutional coordination for strategic \nplanning for the YREB; (ii) significant regional disparity between the highly developed global \nagglomeration  region  of  the  Yangtze  River  Delta  (eastern  subregion)  and  the  central  and \nwestern subregions (or the middle and upper reaches) of the YREB, with the central and \nwestern subregions lagging behind in economic diversification and industrial modernization; (iii) \nlimited  integration  of  waterways,  ports,  and  intermodal  logistics;  and  (iv)  increasing \nenvironmental pollution and pressure on natural resources.  \n \n4.  In April 2014, the State Council issued guidelines to enhance the traffic capacity of the \nriver and its tributaries in the YREB. It is envisaged that an integrated transport system will \nconnect roads, railways, waterways, and air routes by 2020. The government plans to boost the \ndevelopment of railways, highways, waterways, and airways along the Yangtze River to build a \nmultimodal  transport  corridor.  The  service  industry,  green  energy,  and  agricultural \nmodernization  and  industrialization  also  feature  prominently  in  plans  for  the  YREB,  with \ncoordinated urbanization and urban\u2013rural integration along the river, including the Chengdu\u2013\nChongqing city cluster and Guizhou and Yunnan provinces. At the same time, water resources \nwill be protected through strict control over pollution along the river. \n \n5.  The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) prepared a preliminary \nframework of the Outline of Planning on Development Strategy of Yangtze River Economic Belt. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 November 2015. \n2  http://china.org.cn/business/2014-09/26/content_33619889.htm, \nhttp://en.xinfinance.com/html/Policy/2015/147831.shtml, and \nhttp://english.gov.cn/state_council/vice_premiers/2015/11/26/content_281475242726998.htm \n ", "2 \nThe final version will be issued prior to the release of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20122020. \nIn line with the State Council\u2019s guidelines, the planning framework will strengthen access to \nregions along the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and boost growth in inland regions, \nreducing economic disparities between the eastern, central, and western YREB subregions. \n \n6.  The  government  is  seeking  support  for  strengthening  the  planning  for  industrial \ntransformation;  and  recognizes  that  better  coordination,  integration,  and  implementation  of \nholistic  development  approaches  is  needed  among  the  provinces.3  Aspects  of  needed \ncoordination include urban and social development, human resource capacity and workforce \ndevelopment,  economic  and  industrial  development,  multi-tier  and  multimodal  transport \ninfrastructure development, environmental protection and water resources management, energy \nsupply  and  management  including  renewable  and  low-carbon  initiatives,  private  sector \nengagement, and cross-provincial institutional arrangements. \n \n7.  The TA will contribute to the PRC\u2019s sustainable development agenda, as presented \nduring the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and \nthe PRC National New-Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020. It is in line with ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020, which emphasized the importance of environmentally sustainable and \ninclusive growth.4 The anticipated interventions will be aligned with and contribute to ADB\u2019s \nmain  sector  plans,  e.g.,  the  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  Operational  Plan;  the  Water \nOperational  Plan,  2011\u20132020;  the  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20132020;  Environment \nOperational  Directions,  2013\u20132020;  and  the  Operational  Plan  for  Agriculture  and  Natural \nResources: Promoting Sustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific in 2015\u20132020.5 Where \nrelevant, the TA will also contribute to the implementation of the memorandum of understanding \nbetween  Hunan  Provincial  Government  and  ADB  for  the  promotion  of  climate  technology \ndevelopment and deployment.6  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  impact  will  be  reduced  economic  disparities  among  the  eastern,  central,  and \nwestern YREB subregions. The expected outcome will be strengthened investment planning \namong local governments in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB.7 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) government directions and priorities for industrial \ntransformation  of  YREB  analyzed,  (ii)  priorities  for  investment  opportunities  for  industrial \n                                                \n3  This may include a need for improved coordination, cooperation, and connectivity among the three agglomeration \nregions. \n4  ADB. 2013.

The memorandum of understanding aims at promoting globally advanced and \nemerging low-carbon technology for investments in Hunan Province, and sharing experiences and practices in low-\ncarbon technology development with other developing countries in the region. \n7  Development history and experiences in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will be considered during \nimplementation of the TA, but the investment focus will be for the middle and upper Yangtze River, including the \nmiddle Yangtze City Cluster around Wuhan and the upper Yangtze reaches around Chongqing. \n ", "3 \ntransformation in selected municipalities in the middle and upper reaches of YREB identified, \nand (iii) human resource development needs assessed. The focus of the outputs may be further \nrefined during the TA inception phase. Outputs 1 and 3 aim at planning for medium and long-\nterm industrial transformation in the YREB. Output 2, aiming more specifically at identifying \ninvestment  opportunities,  comprises  two  phases:  (i)  selection  of  target  municipalities  and \nmunicipal clusters, and (ii) identification and conceptualization of investment projects in selected \nmunicipalities and municipal cluster.  \n \n10.  Output  1  will  analyze  government  directions  and  priorities  for  the  industrial \ntransformation  of  YREB.  This  output  will  comprehend  existing  and  planned  economic  and \nindustrial development (e.g., relocation, upgrading, and innovation) planning and priorities for \nlocations  and  industries,  including  analysis  of  the  supporting  infrastructure  development \nplanning\u2014such as the planning for transport and logistics, policy development for promoting \nregional cooperation, and the balanced city cluster development within the YREB at large.  \n \n11.  Output 1 will \n(i)  analyze  the  existing  overall  economic  geography  and  the  main  industrial \neconomic development zones and industrial parks within the YREB; \n(ii)  assess the competitive advantages of key industries in the YREB nationally and \ninternationally, and identify key factors to strengthen the competitive advantages \nfor the future; \n(iii)  analyze priority initiatives within the YREB based on national, provincial, and key \nmunicipal level economic and industrial development (e.g., relocation, upgrading, \nand innovation) planning; and \n(iv)  assess investment needs for implementation of the overall envisioned industrial \ntransformation strategy for the YREB in terms of (a) infrastructure (e.g., utility, \ntransport, energy); (b) enabling business environment (e.g., financial services, \nlogistic services, investment policies, facilities, and policies related to external \ntrade and customs); and (c) environmental goods and services. \n \n12.  Output 2 will identify investment opportunities for industrial transformation in selected \nmunicipalities  and  municipal  cluster  in  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the  YREB.  The \nproposed investments will (i) generate employment opportunities; (ii) facilitate coordinated city-\ncluster and integrated urban\u2013rural development; (iii) promote spillover effects and linkages from \nlarge cities to small cities, towns, and villages; and (iv) have demonstration effects on industrial \ntransformation and could be scaled up to other municipalities and municipal clusters in the \nYREB. These objectives are key to the government\u2019s goal of reducing economic disparities \nbetween the eastern, middle, and western reaches of the YREB. Investment opportunities \nrelated to economic development zones and industrial parks will be focused on as a driver for \nindustrial transformation.  \n \n13.  Output 2 will \n(i)  define suitable factors and process to select municipalities for the demonstration \nof pilot industrial transformation in development zones, in consultation with the \nNDRC, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and ADB; \n(ii)  short-list  candidate  municipalities  and/or  municipal  cluster  via  a  thorough \nassessment based on the selection factors in consultation with the NDRC, MOF, \nand ADB; \n(iii)  consult  with  short-listed  municipal  governments  to  finalize  the  selection  of \nmunicipalities; \n ", "4 \n(iv)  help selected municipal government(s) design comprehensive plan(s) (or make \nexisting  plans  comprehensive)  for  industrial  transformation  which  prescribe \nsolutions  to  various  issues  that  directly  and  indirectly  hinder  industrial \ntransformation\u2014such  as  lack  of  infrastructure,  labor  skill  mismatch,  lack  of \nenabling  business  environments,  weak  supply  chains,  a  weak  social welfare \nsystem, potential environmental impacts, and pressure on natural resources; \n(v)  help  the  municipal  government(s)  identify  investment  opportunities  for  ADB \nfinancing that will support the comprehensive industrial transformation plan and \npromote  various  development  objectives\u2014such  as  employment  generation, \nintegration of industrial development in urbanization, green energy, renewable \nand low-carbon initiatives, and circular economy; \n(vi)  conceptualize those investment opportunities in the form of ADB projects and/or \nprograms, and identify an appropriate financing modality; and \n(vii)  make  recommendations  for  future  investments  for  the  municipalities  and \nmunicipal cluster selected and short-listed to ensure longer term support and \ncooperation. \n \n14.  Output  3  will  assess  human  resources  development  needs  taking  into  account  the \ngovernment directions and priorities for the industrial transformation of the YREB from output 1. \nThe industrial transformation can have significant impacts on the surrounding rural and peri-\nurban areas, not only in terms of pressures on resources, notably water and food, but also \nsignificant implications for needed changes in the labor force and associated education systems.  \n \n15.  Output 3 will \n(i)  assess the existing higher education and technical and vocational education and \ntraining system, and how it responds to supporting human resource development, \nto support the priorities of industrial transformation in the YREB;  \n(ii)  assess  labor  market  requirements  and  projections,  including  emerging \noccupations, to identify human resources needs in the context of ongoing and \nplanned industrial transformation initiatives in small and medium-sized cities in \nthe middle and upper reaches of the YREB; \n(iii)  train project municipal government(s) on human resource development planning; \nand \n(iv)  prepare the outline for a human resources development plan, based on a labor \nforce assessment, conducive to industrial transformation. \n \n16.  At the outset of the TA, a consultation and work plan will be prepared. The TA will \norganize events to discuss with provincial, municipal, and county authorities; sector companies; \nbranch  organizations;  representatives  of  industry;  research  institutes;  commercial  banks; \nenvironmental agencies; and other potential stakeholders to identify urgent investment needs. \nDuring the discussion, opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships and different financing and \nlending modalities will be explored, in line with possible regional and provincial development \nplans and investment programs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $550,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, meeting venues, local transportation \nin the provinces, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months from 1 January 2016 to 31 March 2017. \nThe executing agency will be the NDRC, represented by the Foreign Capital Utilization and \nOverseas Investment  Department. The  NDRC will  be  responsible  for the  overall  planning, \ncoordination,  and  supervision  of  the  TA.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  municipal \ngovernments to be selected under output 2 at an early stage of the TA. Project management \noffices will be established at the selected municipal governments. The TA will be implemented \nin close cooperation with the International Economic and Financial Cooperation Department of \nMOF. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  provide  6.5  person-months  of  international  and  29.0  person-months  of \nnational consulting services. The consultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  through  individual  consultant \nselection. This is considered the most efficient method as the consultants will be supervised by \ndifferent cross-sectoral teams in ADB\u2019s East Asia Department. Cross-sectoral teams comprising \nstaff from different divisions have been established upon the request of the government. The \nEnvironmental,  Natural  Resources,  and  Agriculture  Division  will  take  the  overall  lead  for \nadministration  of  the  TA.  Disbursements  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  It  is  anticipated  that  the \nconsultants will be mobilized during the first quarter of 2016. \n \n20.  Resource persons will be engaged to assist in the preparation of presentation materials, \nand  make  presentations  during  the  in-country  workshops  and  consultation.  One  full-time \nadministrative support staff will be engaged for 10 person-months to assist the NDRC in the \ncoordination of the TA, and the organization of workshops and consultations.  \n \n21.  It is proposed that the NDRC administer the larger consultation workshops, for which an \nadvance payment facility will be established. The NDRC has the capacity to manage the funds, \nas it has experience working with ADB and other development partners.  \n \n22.  The  TA  will  follow  the  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-\nadministered TA. Best practices and lessons will be disseminated through technical workshops \nand via various technical reports, knowledge products, and other publications posted on the \nwebsites of the NDRC and ADB. \n \n23.  To ensure effective and efficient coordination among the NDRC, the local government, \nand national sector ministries, an inception phase is scheduled during which the consultation \nand coordination mechanisms will be discussed between the NDRC, ADB, and consultants. A \nconsultation and work plan will be agreed upon, prior to contacting the local government and \nsector ministries. The final agreements will be discussed and agreed during the TA inception \nworkshop.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strengthening Provincial Planning and \nImplementation for the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK   \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nThe economic disparities between the eastern, central, and western YREB subregions reduced. \n \n(Guidelines on Promoting the Development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Building on the Golden \nWaterway; Economic development plan for the Yangtze River Economic Belt)a \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome   By 2016:     \nInvestment planning  At least two investment projects  ADB country  Investment \namong local  and/or programs conducive to  programming missions  proposals of \ngovernments in middle  overall planning for industrial    project municipal \nand upper reaches of  transformation at municipal    government(s) \nthe YREB strengthened  level conceptualized  are not suitable \n  (2015 baseline: none)  for ADB financing \nOutputs  By 2016:     \n1.
