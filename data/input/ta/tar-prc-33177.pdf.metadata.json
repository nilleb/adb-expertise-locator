Resolving the issues related to water quality and pollution control in the Songhua River is a \npriority of the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  Following the successful \nexample of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed advisory technical assistance (TA) for Hai \nRiver  Wastewater  Management  and  Pollution  Control1  and  of  the  ongoing  TA  cluster  for \nTransjurisdictional Environmental Management,2 the PRC has requested advisory TA to support \nthe cleanup of the Songhua River basin. A Fact-Finding Mission was conducted in conjunction with \nthe Appraisal Mission for the Harbin Water Supply Project3 that visited the PRC from 18 to 29 \nSeptember  2002,  confirmed  the  objectives,  scope,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA.4 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Songhua river basin (SRB) is the third largest river basin in the PRC after those of the \nChangjiang and Yellow Rivers. Located in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and in the Autonomous \nRegion of Inner Mongolia, the SRB has a catchment area of 557,000 square kilometers and a \npopulation of 62 million. The urban population is relatively high, with 43% of the population of the \nbasin living in cities or towns. Harbin (urban population, 2.6 million), Changchun (2 million), Qiqihar \n(1.1 million), and Daqing (1 million) are key centers of economic development. The rural population \ntotals 35.4 million (57%) and about 17.4 million ha (31%) of the basin\u2019s area is farmland. While \nagriculture remains a significant economic activity, the region is an important industrial base. \nPRC\u2019s largest chemical industries were established on the upper reaches of the Songhua River in \nthe 1970s. Jilin is a key site of the national chemical industry, producing inorganic and organic \nchemicals. Harbin and Daqing and Qiqihar have electricity generation, chemical, oil/gas, fiber, \nplastic, lumber, and textile industries. Changchun hosts the automobile industry for the northeast \nregion, as well as chemicals, food processing, and a host of secondary and tertiary industries and \nservices. Qiqihar has metallurgical, machine tool, chemical, gold mining, and lumber industries. \nDaqing has the country\u2019s largest oil fields. \n \n3.  With population growth and rapid economic development, the number of pollution sources \nand the volume of untreated or partially treated waste discharged have increased, creating serious \nthreats to the environment and to human living conditions. The Songhua River is one of the most \npolluted  of  the  47  major  rivers  in  the  PRC,  and  is  contaminated  with  a  number  of  organic \nchemicals, some metals, and conventional pollutants. Water pollution has been identified as a \nmajor  constraint  to  the  sustainable  development  of  PRC\u2019s  economy.  The  Songliao  Water \nResources Commission (SLWRC) was established in the early 1990s, under the Ministry of Water \nResources (MWR), to oversee issues related to water use and pollution control in the SRB.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 December 2002. \n \nThis revised paper reflects agreed changes in implementation arrangements based on consultations \ncarried out between February and April 2003 with stakeholders at the central, provincial and regional \nlevels. The changes in implementation arrangements were formally endorsed by ADB  11 April 2003. \n \nThe revised paper has been prepared to consolidate agreed changes and provide a basic reference \nto facilitate implementation. \n ", "2 \nSongliao River Basin Water Resources Protection Bureau (WRPB) was established within the \nSLWRC to oversee issues related to water quality and pollution control (WQPC) in the Songhua \nand Liao River Basins. WRPB serves as the secretariat of the Songliao Watershed Protection \nLeading Group (SLWPLG) consisting of the governments of Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang and Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region, SLWRC, and Bureaus of Water Resources and Environmental \nProtection. SLWPLG has played an important role in SRB water pollution control management, \nincluding setting up water quality targets, developing water pollution prevention recommendations \nand restoring the Songhua River water quality. WRPB has conducted water quality monitoring, \nenvironmental impact assessment, environmental engineering design and scientific research on \nlarge and medium scale water projects but, as the concept of a river basin water quality and \npollution management was not widely understood, WRPB\u2019s role has not been adequately defined \nand it has not been able to exercise the full range of its responsibilities. While several ongoing \ninitiatives to control pollution emissions and improve Songhua River water quality have had some \nsuccess in recent years, it is uncertain how long the Songhua River will remain excessively \npolluted.  The  Government  deadline  of  December  2000  for  providing  industrial  wastewater \ntreatment was associated with control of conventional pollutants, rather than the types of trace \norganic chemicals affecting the SRB. Although PRC\u2019s quality guidelines5 for drinking water cover \ntrace organic chemicals, the effective removal of those pollutants from the Songhua River is not \ncurrently monitored.6\n \n4.  To date, ADB policy dialogue has stressed the need for strengthening SWRC to give it \ngreater  authority  for  comprehensive  flood  management7and  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement including issues related to WQPC. MWR has recently prepared the draft SRB Water \nResources Protection Plan, including water use function zone classification, pollution reduction \nquantity proposals and pollution control strategies and measures. In parallel, State Environmental \nProtection Administration (SEPA) has completed the draft Songhua Water Pollution Control Plan. \nThese plans represent the first concrete steps needed to return the Songhua River to minimum \nwater quality levels.8 The actual effects are not expected to be seen earlier than in 2015. A new \nlaw on management of water resources adopted late last year9 formally introduces the concept of \nriver basin management. Under the new law, river basin management institutions have been given \nexpanded authority over river basin management10, including WQPC. WRPB and the SLWPLG \nhave a mandate to coordinate WQPC activities in the SRB, and to integrate the MWR Water \nResources Protection Plan and SEPA Water Pollution Control Plan. \n  \n5.  Water  polluted  by  biological  or  chemical  sources  is  a  serious  public  health  concern. \nHowever, the precise quantification of the risks and assessment of the full implications associated \nwith using the Songhua River as a water source has not been possible. From 1997 to 2000, water \nquality  monitoring  along  the  Songhua  River  revealed  the  presence  of chemicals  known to be  \n                                                 \n5 The 1985 PRC Water Quality Standards defines quality standards for treated water. Potable Water Quality Guidelines,    \nprepared by the Ministry of Public Health was adopted in January 2002. New parameters have been introduced and    \nmore stringent values have been adopted. \n6 While some organic chemicals are currently treated and removed by existing municipal and industrial wastewater                  \ntreatment facilities, several chemical compounds have not yet been addressed. Water pollution from pesticides, \nchemical fertilizers,  and trace organic  chemicals from  nonpoint  sources  may  continue  if no adequate measures are \n   are taken urgently. \n7  ADB. 2002. Report  and  Recommendation of the President  to the Board of  Directors on a Proposed Loan to the PRC  \n   for the Songhua River Flood Management Sector Project. Manila. \n8 The 1999 PRC surface water environmental quality standards define standards for raw water. \n9 The Law on the Management of Water  Resources was  approved by  the  Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s     \n   Congress on 29 August 2002 and became effective 1 October 2002. \n10\nArticle 12 of the law specifies that for the major national rivers and lakes the State Council sets up a responsible \nauthority for river basin management, which should carry out water resources management and supervision under \nrelevant laws and regulations. ", "    3 \nharmful to human health.11 While the study made a major contribution to knowledge of Songhua \nRiver issues, the data may not accurately reveal the actual level of contamination and related \nhealth risks. Much of the data is not quantitative; without accurately determining concentrations of \nthe chemicals of concern, it is difficult to conclude the level of risk with certainty. An associated \nepidemiological study identified heightened levels of health risk in the use of Songhua River water \nfor drinking.  However, flaws in the methodology of the study limit confidence in its conclusions. \n \n6.  The TA will assist WRPB and TA stakeholders to synchronize efforts to develop effective \nmechanisms for SRB WQPC management, and urgently address a number of associated policy, \ntechnical,  institutional,  regulatory,  and  financial  issues.  The  TA  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nstrategic and environmental objectives in the water sector. \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n7.  The overall goal of the advisory TA is to improve water quality in the Songhua River. The \nTA will strengthen the capacity of WRPB and central and local TA stakeholders for policy analysis \nand pollution control management, and assist them in developing a long term vision and plan for \npollution control in the SRB. The immediate objectives are to assist the Government in identifying \nlines of institutional responsibility, developing basinwide, regulatory enforcement and executing \nmechanisms, and refining and prioritizing short- to long-term pollution control plans.  The TA will (i) \nestablish and initiate a program of priority studies and surveys to address technical knowledge \ngaps; (ii) strengthen the WQPC management role of WRPB and build its capacity; and; (iii) support  \nWRPB, central and local TA stakeholders in developing an integrated water quality and pollution \ncontrol management plan (IWQPCMP) up to year 2015 and an immediate action plan up to the \nyear 2010, under the quidance of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). \nThe TA will also develop appropriate and acceptable dissemination mechanisms, including public \ninformation campaigns to educate the public on the health risks associated with water pollution, \nand benefits from water saving and water protection.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will be conducted in three phases. During phase 1, data collection and situation \nanalysis, the TA consultants will \n \n(i)  identify  relevant  counterparts  among  Government  agencies  and  scientific  research \nbodies and establish  working contact with them; \n(ii)  review  the  baseline  information  on  social,  environmental,  economic,  financial,  and \ntechnical conditions of SRB; \n(iii)  review and analyze current and planned institutional, legislative, administrative, and \ntechnical controls setup for water quality and water resources management; \n(iv)  review relevant Government policies and plans, including the SEPA Water Pollution \nControl Plan and the MWR Water Resources Protection Plan; and \n                                                 \n11The study was conducted jointly by the Heilongjiang Provincial Environmental Protection Research Institute, Harbin        \nCity and National Environmental Monitoring and Testing Stations, Songliao Water Resource Protection Bureau, Harbin     \nUniversity of Medicine, Harbin University of Industries, and Sawa Universtiy, France. It reported 191 trace organic   \nchemicals (detected or suspected) in the Songhua River over its 1,200 kilometer length, of which 46 chemicals are  \nknown to cause serious health concerns. \n \n ", "4 \n(v)  assess the quality of the available scientific data, propose and carry out measures to \nverify or modify its conclusions and identify technical knowledge gaps. \n \n9.  In phase 2, development of institutional and regulatory mechanisms, the consultants will \n \n(i)  assess  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  existing  institutional  and  regulatory \nsystem; \n(ii)  develop  recommendations  on  responsibilities  and  regulations  for  protecting  water \nresources  and  preventing  pollution  basinwide  by  defining  policy,  institutional,  and \ntechnical roles of WRPB and central and local TA stakeholders; \n(iii)  develop  long-term  suggestions  for  basin-wide  coordination  of  WRPB  and  local  TA \nstakeholders on the issues of water quality and water use; and \n(iv)  strengthen the WQPC management role of WRPB in the SRB area, build its capacity \nand develop its long term work program. \n \n10.  In phase 3, formulation of  IWQPCMP and an immediate action plan, the consultants will \n \n(i)  recommend  achievable  water  and  wastewater  quality  targets,  given  the  physical, \nfinancial, social, and political constraints;  \n(ii)  in close coordination with WRPB and central and local TA stakeholders, incorporate the \nMWR Songhua River Basin Water Resources Protection Plan and the SEPA Five-Year \nSonghua  River  Basin  Water  Pollution  Control  Plan;  as  well  as  inputs  of  local  TA \nstakeholders into IWQPCMP under the guidance of the NDRC; formulate a framework \nand  milestones of IWQPCMP up to the year 2015; produce the immediate action plan \nup to the year 2010, prioritizing the various initiatives, and identifying and proposing \ninvestment packages suitable for external assistance; \n(iii)  develop recommendations for establishing of the environmental management system \nfor industrial pollution control; and \n(iv)  prepare and initiate long-term public information campaigns that explain water issues \nand  sensitize  consumers  to  the  benefits  of  water-saving  practices;  develop  public \nparticipation  mechanisms  to  promote  health  awareness  among  TA  stakeholders, \neducate the general public on potential risks caused by Songhua River pollution, and \nfacilitate the implementation of priority actions aimed at curbing pollution and mitigating \nassociated human health risks. \n \n11.  The results of each phase will feed into the next phase. Implementable strategies and \nprograms to be developed through this TA will be supported by establishing  working contacts and \nstructured working relationships with identified TA stakeholders. The TA team will work closely with \ncentral, provincial, and municipal authorities; river basin agencies; and representatives of the \nacademic community in reviewing, assessing, and prioritizing programs proposed under the TA, \nallowing for a high level of counterpart ownership. The TA will draw extensively on the experience \nof  ongoing  and  past  ADB-financed  loans  and  TAs.  The  TA  will  stress  introduction  of  public \nparticipation and public information programs. The quality of the TA outputs will enhance the \nparticipation of external experts at critical junctures. For the TA to succeed, the Government must \nclosely coordinate between the stakeholders, dialogue fully and in a transparent manner with the \nTA consultants, and disclose all necessary technical data. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,300,000 equivalent, comprising $550,000 in \nforeign exchange and $750,000 in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will finance $1,000,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign ", "    5 \nexchange cost and part of the local currency cost equivalent to $450,000. The Government will \nfinance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $300,000,  by  providing  offices, \nfacilities,  data  collection,  and  remuneration  for  the  counterpart  staff.  A  schedule  of  the  cost \nestimates and the financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  WRPB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. WRPB will set up a project management \noffice headed by a senior officer as the project manager, assisted by administrative officers and \nsupporting staff. The project manager will oversee the implementation of the TA and, among other \nthings, will (i) ensure adequate interdepartmental cooperation and interagency coordination, (ii) \nfacilitate the consultants\u2019 operations, (iii) monitor the progress of TA implementation, and (iv) \ncoordinate communications with ADB and concerned Government agencies. TA implementation \nunits will be established in the provinces of Heilongjiang, and Jilin and Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion under the auspices of the provincial environmental protection bureaus. \n \n14.  A Project Leading Group chaired by  NDRC will be formed to serve as a steering committee \non a central level and MWR, SEPA and the Ministry of Construction (MOC) are proposed as \ndeputy leaders. The Project Leading Group will meet periodically to provide policy guidance, \nfacilitate  interagency  coordination,  and  resolve  any  institutional  problems  affecting  TA \nimplementation. The members will include senior-level representatives of the SLWRC, Ministry of \nFinance, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Land Resources, and State \nForestry Administration. To synchronize implementation at the SRB level a Project Coordination \nGroup will be established under the auspices of SLWPLG, chaired by the Deputy Governor of the \nJilin Provincial Government. The SLWPLG will be expanded to include the other provincial and \nmunicipal stakeholders: Bureaus of Finance, Construction, Land Resources, Agriculture, Forest, \nHealth,  and  Meteorology;  Development  Planning  Commission;  and  Economy  and  Trade \nCommittee. An advisory body, consisting of the TA\u2019s international and domestic consultants and \ntwo external experts (one international expert and one domestic expert), familiar with PRC\u2019s water \npollution problems will assist the TA. \n \n15.  A firm of international consultants, in association with domestic consultants, will be engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants following quality and cost-based \nselection procedures and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging  \ndomestic consultants. Simplified technical proposals will be used. The TA will require about 72 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services:  20  international  consultants  and  52  domestic.  The \ninternational consultants will have expertise in wastewater management and pollution control, \nsocial analysis and assessments, environmental economics, environmental institutions, and river \nbasin management. The domestic consultants will provide services in wastewater management \nand pollution control, industrial pollution control, water treatment, financial analysis, environmental \nlaw,  health  risk  assessment/epidemiology,  social  assessments,  environmental  institutions, \ndevelopment, and water and wastewater engineering/interpretation. Equipment will be procured \naccording to ADB Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from from December 2003 to November 2004. \nThe consultants will prepare an inception report within 1 month after starting the services; an \ninterim report after 5.5 months, covering phases 1 and 2; a draft final report after 10.5 months, \ncovering all three phases; and a final report within 1 month after receiving comments on the draft \nfinal report. The consultants will organize a number of working seminars and three workshops. \nWorkshop participants will be key officials from the concerned central, provincial, and municipal \ngovernment  agencies;  international  assistance  agencies;  professional  associations;  and \nnongovernment  associations.  External  experts  will  also  be  invited  to  review  and  discuss  the ", "6 \nconsultant\u2019s reports during the workshops. An initial workshop will promote participation at all \nlevels, agree on the approach to implementing the TA, and refine the parameters of the TA. This \nworkshop will coincide with the first tripartite meeting. A second workshop will discuss the interim \nresults of the study. A concluding workshop will take place in conjunction with the final tripartite \nreview to present and discuss the investments proposed in the draft final report. The final report \nwill incorporate comments from the Government, external experts, final workshop participants, and \nADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000, on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution \nControl Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

Formulate a Strategic Action Plan (Phase 3) \n \n4.  The phase 3 consultants will perform these tasks: \n \n(i)  Evaluate the economic basis for existing water quality targets, recommend changes \nif the basis is not sound. Recommend achievable water and wastewater quality \ntargets, given the various physical, financial, social, and political constraints. \n \n(ii)  Incorporate  the  SEPA  Pollution  Control  Plan  and  the  MWR  Water  Resources \nProtection Plan as well as inputs of local TA stakeholders, and incorporate them into \nan integrated water quality and pollution control management plan (IWQPCMP) to \nyear 2015 under the guidance of NDRC. For the domestic wastewater management \nprograms and proposals, assess the proposed collection and treatment; disposal \nsystems,  including  combined  and  separate  sanitary  and  storm  sewers;  primary, \nsecondary, and tertiary wastewater treatment; and land disposal. For the industrial \nwastewater  management  programs  and  proposals,  identify  the  degree  to  which \nactions have been and will be taken, including progress in installing/constructing on-\nsite  and  off-site  treatment  systems,  closure  of  industries  to  prevent  industrial \npollution, adoption of clean technologies, relocation of industries. For the adoption of \nclean technologies, review the pollution prevention aspects of the processes and \ndetermine their technical, financial, and economic viability and the environmental \nbenefits of using these technologies. As a number of upstream factories are very old \nand produce or use toxic and hazardous chemicals, determine the monitoring, early \nwarning, and alarm systems that could protect the integrity of the water supply \nsystem. \n \n(iii)  In  cooperation  with  the  stakeholders,  identify  socioeconomic  development \nopportunities and assess problems and constraints in implementing the IWQPCMP \n(physical, financial, social, legal, institutional, and political), and suggest appropriate \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \nsolutions to achieve the set goal of the SRB cleanup, giving due attention to the \nspecific characteristics of the river and the diversified nature of the basin area, \nemphasizing  the  need  to  control  pollution  at  source,  and  giving  economic  and \nfinancial incentives.  \n \n(iv)  Implement surveys of representative groups of consumers to determine ability and \nwillingness to pay for water and sanitation services and perception of environmental \nissues.
