During the Country Programming Mission (15 April\u20134 May 2005), the Government of the\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam (the Government) confirmed its original plan to have the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  continue  assisting  it  in  implementing  the  Public  Administration\nReform  (PAR)  Master  Program  (MP)  2001\u20132010.1 The  continuing  assistance  will build on\nprevious assistance, namely Subprogram I of the loan cluster Support Implementation of the\nPAR Master Program (SIPARMP I),2 which has been approved and implemented together with\nthree accompanying technical assistance (TA) projects (TA 4080, TA 4081, and TA 4082),\nSIPARMP I and its accompanying TA projects are now close to completion.3 The Government\nrequested from ADB a project preparatory technical assistance to formulate Subprogram II of\nthe Support Implementation of PAR Master Program (SIPARMP II). ADB fielded a TA fact-\nfinding mission on 12\u201315 July 2005 to discuss the TA and reached an understanding with the\nGovernment  about  the  scope  of  the  TA  and  its  implementation  arrangements.  The  TA\nframework is in Appendix 1.4\nII.  ISSUES\n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s public administration has undergone some major changes since the adoption\nin 1986 of the policy of renovation, which was designed to prepare the country for its transition\nfrom a centrally planned economy to a socialist-oriented market economy. Since then, Viet Nam\nhas  continued  to  realize  considerable  socioeconomic  achievements,  including  fast  overall\neconomic growth and substantial poverty reduction, while ensuring social inclusion for the poor\nand unprivileged. The integration of the Vietnamese economy with the world economy has been\nintensified through bilateral and regional trade agreements and recently through preparations for\naccession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization.  PAR  needs  to  catch  up  with  these  policy\ndevelopments and reform agenda.\n3.  The Government\u2019s PAR MP laid a foundation for the public sector to shift its role from\ncontrolling (or \u201crowing\u201d) to enabling (or \u201csteering\u201d) to realize the twin goals of high economic\ngrowth and sustainable poverty reduction.5 The PAR MP is a comprehensive program covering\nfour key focus areas and seven action programs. The four key focus areas are (i) institutional\nreform, (ii) reform of the organizational structure of public administration, (iii) renovation of the\ncivil service, and (iv) public finance reform. These four focus areas are further subdivided into\nseven action programs: (i) improving the quality of legal documents; (ii) revising the roles,\nfunctions, and organizational structures of the Government; (iii) down-sizing staff; (iv) improving\n1  The Prime Minister approved the MP for 2001\u20132010 in September 2001, by decision no. 136/2001/QD-TTg. Of\nseven action programs under the MP, the Government requested ADB financing to support the implementation of\n(i) improving the quality of the cadres and civil servants, and (ii) modernization of the public administration system\nof the Office of the Government.\n2  ADB. 2002.Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan\nCluster, Phase I of the Proposed Program Loan and Technical Assistance Grants to the Socialist Republic of Viet\nNam to Support Implementation of the Public Administration Reform Master Program in Viet Nam. Manila (Loan\n1992-VIE).\n3  Loan 1992-VIE and its accompanying TA projects under SIPARMP I have been implemented since April 2003. The\nsecond and last tranche was released to the Government on the value date of 7 October 2005. The three TA\nprojects include (i) TA 4080, (ii) TA 4081, and (iii) TA 4082. These three TA projects were proposed and approved\nalong with the proposed program loan in December 2002. They are envisaged as continuing until the end of 2005\nto help the executing agencies finish all requisite TA outputs.\n4 The TA first appeared inADB Business Opportunities on 8 August 2005.\n5 The overall goal of PAR MP is to build \u201ca democratic, clean, strong, professional, modern, effective, and efficient\npublic administration system that operates in line with the principle of the Socialist state, ruled by law and under the\nleadership of the Party.\u201d", "2\nthe quality of cadres and civil servants; (v) reforming the salary structure; (vi) improving financial\nmanagement  mechanisms for administrative and public  service  delivery agencies; and  (vii)\nmodernizing public administration systems. Within these seven subprograms, the Government\nhas requested ADB financing to support the implementation of action programs 4 and 7. Several\ndevelopment partners provide assistance to the Government for other action programs.6\n4.  The PAR MP has served as a guiding tool for comprehensive reform in governance and\npublic administration. The first 5-year phase of the PAR MP will conclude at the end of 2005,\nand preparations are underway to develop detailed objectives for the next 5-year cycle, which\nconveniently corresponds with the next 5-year socioeconomic development plan (SEDP) of the\nGovernment. The new SEDP will be Viet Nam\u2019s national strategy for poverty reduction, which\nwill incorporate the fundamentals of the Government\u2019s comprehensive poverty reduction and\ngrowth strategy. That strategy recognized good governance through PAR as an important pillar\nof the country\u2019s poverty reduction and growth strategy. It is therefore important to synchronize\nthe second cycle of the PAR MP and the new SEDP and support further PAR implementation.\n5.  The implementation of PAR MP Phase I, which picked up speed in recent years, has\nestablished building blocks of critical reforms under the PAR MP, including a new organization\nof the Government, the separation of administrative and civil servants, and the simplification of\ngovernment procedures to create an enabling environment for business. The PAR Steering\nCommittee, the Secretariat to the PAR Steering Committee, and the PAR Department of the\nMinistry of Home Affairs (MOHA) have been established and strengthened to steer the reform\nprogram.  However,  the  number  of  highly  qualified  and  experienced  staff  supporting  and\ncoordinating PAR is still not sufficient. Many PAR issues have been addressed but only with\nvarying  degrees  of  success.  The  implementation  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)\nmechanisms under the PAR MP function reasonably well, though it took a long time to develop\nthose mechanisms and they still have much room for improvement. Currently M&E is carried out\nonly internally and therefore limited, as it is not supplemented by external M&E. The areas that\nare partly successful will be addressed in the next cycle of the PAR MP with support from\nSIPARMP II and other assistance.\n6.  Over  the  next  5  years,  Viet  Nam  will  increasingly  intensify  its  socioeconomic\ndevelopment efforts to become a market-oriented and internationally integrated economy. The\npressures  of  globalization  and  integration,  as  well  as  the  increasing  sophistication  and\ncomplexity of society and the economy, will pose new and different challenges. The second\ncycle of the PAR MP will take into account decentralization policies and their implementation.\nBetter  coordination  and  greater  coherence  in  administration  are  considered  necessary  to\nachieve efficiency and effectiveness in public management tasks. Lessons learned from the first\ncycle of the PAR MP will be useful to guide the formulation of the next cycle. A stronger public\nadministration  system  will  be  required  to  cope  with  the  emerging  public  service  delivery\nchallenges in the context of a more open and market-oriented economy.\n7.  ADB has assisted the Government in implementing the PAR MP, particularly those\nareas related to training civil servants and modernizing public administration systems. ADB\napproved SIPARMP I for $45 million in January 2003 under a program cluster modality. The\nprogram loan cluster comprises three subprograms to support the Government\u2019s PAR MP,\n6  See Appendix 7: Development Coordination Matrix in the report and recommendation of the President for Loan\n1992-VIE (footnote 2).  See also Annex 3\u2014PAR, Anticorruption and ICT/E-government Donor Matrix as per June\n2005 in the draft Governance Assessment of Viet Nam dated August 2005. ADB. 2005. Governance Assessment\n(draft). Hanoi.", "3\ncovering 2001\u20132010. SIPARMP I covers 2003\u20132005. Subprograms II and III will cover 2006\u2013\n2008 and 2008\u20132010, respectively. Noting the progress made in implementing SIPARMP I and\nsatisfying the conditions for the release, ADB approved the release of  the first tranche in\nNovember 2003 and the second tranche in September 2005.\n8.  SIPARMP I focuses on implementing two of the seven action programs of the PAR MP:\n(i) training and retraining to improve the quality of public officials under action program 4 of the\nGovernment\u2019s  PAR  MP,  and  (ii)  modernizing  the  administrative  system  including\ncomputerization and electronic government (E-government) initiatives under action program 7.\nThrough SIPARMP I and TA 4081, the training needs assessment (TNA) for priority groups (i.e.,\ntown and commune leaders, principal experts, and department directors) have been developed.\nBased on the TNA results, module-based training programs are designed for specific groups.\nThe application of the new concept and of the modern methodology in developing the TNA will\nhelp renovate the traditional training system into a new, competency-based training system. A\nstrategic plan to revise training curriculums up to 2010 was also developed. It provides the\nrationale,  objectives,  and  plan  to draw up  a  competency- and  performance-based  training\nsystem.  The  MOHA  strongly  shared  a  view  that  Subprogram  II  will  further  help  deliver\ncompetency-based  and  skill-oriented  training  courses  to  all  public  officials,  and  that  the\nemphasis for training in Subprogram II should be shifted from formulating conceptual plans\n(including  the  TNA,  short  training  courses,  and  curricula)  to  standardizing,  testing,  and\nimplementing renovated training programs.\n9.  In the area of modernizing the administrative system through SIPARMP I and TA 4080\nand  TA  4082,  commendable  efforts  were  made  in  delivering  training  in  information  and\ncommunication technology (ICT) management following the establishment of 115 executive\ninformation units. In the area of applying ICT to provide services to citizens and businesses, 43\npilot  projects  on  shared  software  have  been  implemented.  In  addition,  ADB has  provided\nassistance to the Science and Technology Committee of the National Assembly for preparing\nthe draft law on electronic transaction (E-transaction). The law on E-transaction, which was\nsubmitted to and approved by the National Assembly in November 2005, will provide a legal\nframework for E-government and electronic commercial transactions as the Law will become\neffective in March 2006. However, E-government in Viet Nam is still not advanced enough to\nallow electronic interactions either between the Government and its citizens, or between the\nGovernment and businesses. The implementation of E-government to improve the efficiency\nand  effectiveness  of  the  administrative  system  will  require  further  systematic  reforms  and\nresources. ADB\u2019s further assistance will help the Government formulate and implement the\nsecond cycle of the PAR MP. The new cycle will focus on deepening and sustaining the impact\nof first generation PAR and introduce second generation PAR reaching regional and local\ngovernments to improve public service delivery to people and businesses.\n10.  The Government continues to be committed to further PAR implementation. The ensuing\nprogram loan following the TA will address many new PAR issues and help implement related\naction programs, which will require considerable financial resources. The TA will, among other\nactivities, estimate the cost of new PAR action programs included in the SIPARMP II. The\nensuing program loan will also compliment other governance and PAR activities, including\nanticorruption endeavors,7 the implementation of the SEDP and improvement of governance in\nthe provinces,8 and small and medium enterprises development.\n7 On 5 July 2004, the Government of Viet Nam endorsed the ADB-OECD Anticorruption Initiative for Asia and the\nPacific action plan of ADB and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Viet Nam\nthen became the 23rd member country to join the initiative. Members of the initiative participate in annual meetings", "4\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Impact and Outcome\n11.  The overall goal of the TA is to further improve the public administration system in Viet\nNam through recommending policies and measures for ADB assistance to the Government in\nthe implementation of the PAR MP under the proposed SIPARMP II. The subprogram covers (i)\nimproving the quality of cadres and civil servants and (ii) modernizing public administration\nsystems. The main expected TA outcome is that the Government and ADB reach an agreement\non the proposed program loan to support the implementation of the PAR MP. The expected TA\noutputs  are  (i)  consultant  services and  reports  to  assist  in  the formulation  and  design  of\nSIPARMP II; and (ii) consultative workshops with stakeholders on PAR MP implementation. The\npolicy measures and action programs aim to (i) improve the quality of public officials to improve\npublic service delivery to people and businesses; (ii) strengthen the efficiency, effectiveness,\nand  coordination  of  agencies  through  reengineering  the  Government  agencies\u2019  working\nprocesses and applying ICT; (iii) integrate SEDP implementation and roll down the PAR MP to\nthe provinces; (iv) mitigate negative social risks of PAR measures and actions; and (v) conduct\npolicy dialogue in a well-coordinated and comprehensive manner with the Government and\nother development partners. These outputs will draw on outputs produced by previous TAs to\nthe  Government  related  to  the  implementation  of  PAR  MP,  particularly  from  the  three\naccompanying TA projects of SIPARMP I.\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities\n12.  The TA will use a consultative and participatory process for developing the proposed\nprogram loan. Through this process, the design and implementation of the TA tasks will be\nundertaken in close consultation with both central and local government officials as well as with\nother donors. The TA will build on findings from previous assistance supported by ADB and\nother funding agencies in areas related to PAR.\n13.  Two working groups addressing action programs 4 and 7 will be established to provide a\nsystematic channel for government officials, ADB staff, and consultants to carry out regular\nconsultative meetings regarding the formulation of the subsequent program loan SIPARMP II.\nEach working group will be headed by a director general of a relevant department of MOHA or\nthe Office of the Government (OOG).\n14.  The  key  TA  activities  include  (i)  reviewing  the  PAR  MP  and  evaluate  PAR  MP\nPhase I (2001\u20132005) and other poverty-related documents and data; (ii) preparing the inception,\nmidterm,  and  final  reports;  (iii)  preparing  and  conducting  consultative  workshops  and/or\nseminars with stakeholders on the impact and contribution of the proposed program loan; and\nto report on their anticorruption programs and exchange information and lessons learned in fighting corruption. In\nApril 2005, the Government of Viet Nam hosted the Sixth Steering Group Meeting of the initiative in Hanoi. ADB\nalso has ongoing small-scale TA to support the Government in its anticorruption endeavors through capacity\nbuilding in the Government Inspectorate, which is the focal agency responsible for formulating and implementing\nthe Government\u2019s anticorruption policy.\n8 Two ADB TA projects to support the implementation of poverty reduction and growth programs in the provinces of\nthe Central and Central Highland regions were approved in September and October 2005: ADB. 2005. Technical\nAssistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Capacity Building Support to Dak Nong Province for Improving\nPoverty Reduction and Growth Performance. Manila; and ADB. 2005.

The TA framework\nincluding its impact, outcome, outputs, inputs, and activities, as well as a processing schedule\nfor the TA and a subsequent proposed program loan, were formulated in consultation with the\ntwo Executing Agencies.9\nC.  Cost and Financing\n15.  The total cost of the TA  is estimated at $565,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign\nexchange cost of $272,900 and a local currency cost of $292,100 equivalent. The Government\nhas requested ADB to finance $450,000, including $272,900 in foreign exchange and $177,100\nequivalent in local currency. The TA is proposed to be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA\nfunding program. The Government\u2019s contribution to the TA, estimated at $115,000 equivalent,\nwill  be  in  kind  and  includes  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and\nsecretarial and  office  support.  Details of  the  TA  cost estimates and financing  plan  are  in\nAppendix 2. The Government has been advised that the approval of the TA does not commit\nADB to finance the ensuing project.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16.  The  TA implementation  will require (i) 14 person-months of  international consultant\nservices and (ii) about 28 person-months of domestic consultant services in the fields of public\nadministration  reform,  human  resources  management,  policy  coordination  and  reform,  E-\ngovernment, and local governance. MOHA and OOG will be the Executing Agencies for the TA.\nThe ADB Viet Nam resident mission will administer the TA in close consultation with MOHA,\nOOG, Ministry of Finance, State Bank of Viet Nam, and Ministry of Planning and Investment.\n17.   The TA will be implemented over 10 months starting in May 2006. The budget is based\non a number of output-based contracts requiring international and domestic consulting services.\nConsultants will be recruited on an individual basis. Consultant selection will be quality based\naccording  to  assessments  of  candidate  biographical  data.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank\nand its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants and institutions. MOHA and OOG will undertake necessary logistic arrangements\nfor all workshops and seminars to be conducted under the TA. Appendix 3 gives the outline\nterms of reference for consultants.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to\nthe Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for preparing the Support Implementation\nof Public Administration Reform Master Program, Subprogram II, and hereby reports this action\nto the Board.\n9 The TA Fact-Finding Mission was fielded in Hanoi on 12\u201315 July 2005.
