THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased  loan  (PBL) to the  Republic  of  Indonesia for  subprogram  3  of  the  Financial  Market \nDevelopment and Inclusion Program (FMDIP). \n \n2.  The program supports the main reform priorities of the government and the Financial \nServices Authority (OJK) to further develop and make the finance sector more inclusive by  \n(i) strengthening the regulatory structure for financial stability, (ii) deepening the financial market, \nand (iii) enhancing financial inclusion.1 Subprogram 3 is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), 2019\u20132021 for Indonesia.2 The proposed \nsubprogram is also aligned with the first two operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to \naddress poverty and reduce inequalities, and to accelerate progress in gender equality.3 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The  programmatic  approach  and  budget  support.  FMDIP  uses  a  programmatic \napproach, which aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s reform program over a medium-to \nlong-term horizon. The programmatic approach which consisted of three subprograms and \nsubprogram 1 amounting to $400 million were approved by the ADB Board of Directors in \nSeptember 2015.4 Subprogram 1 included 23 policy actions, focused on institutionalizing OJK as \nan integrated and independent financial services regulator and implementing best practices in \ncapital market development. Subprogram 2 was approved in June 2017 with a loan of $400 million \nand comprised of 25 policy actions. It supported the development of OJK\u2019s consolidated finance \nsector master plan, which focused on making the sector stable, inclusive, and contributive to the \neconomy. It also advanced OJK\u2019s fiscal independence and legal immunity, and began ADB\u2019s \nengagement in financial inclusion.5 All completed policy actions in subprograms 1 and 2 have \nbeen sustained. The focus of Subprogram 3 is on implementing the master plan, expanding \ncapital  market  products  and  services,  and  advancing  financial  inclusion  using  financial \ntechnology. The inclusion of the post-program partnership framework (P3F), 2019\u20132024 will \nenable ADB to continue supporting finance sector reforms and provides the platform for a \nsubsequent financial inclusion-focused program in 2021.   \n \n4.  The development problem. Indonesia\u2019s annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth \naveraged 5.0% during 2014\u20132017. Growth picked up to 5.2% in 2018 from 5.1% in 2017, with \npotential growth estimated at 5.7% for 2020\u20132024.6 However, the government needs to balance \nsustained growth with stability, while reducing inequality to meet the development targets in its \nnational medium-term development plan.7 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Income  inequality  as \nmeasured by the Gini coefficient declined from 0.410 in 2014 to 0.384 in 2018, while the poverty \nrate declined from 11.3% in 2014 to 9.7% in 2018, reaching single digits for the first time. \nNevertheless, close to 40% of the population remains close to the national poverty line and are \nvulnerable to slipping back into poverty. In addition, regional disparity remains a significant \nproblem. For example, the per capita income in Jakarta (about Rp158 million) is 13 times higher \nthan in East Nusa Tenggara. Recent improvements in revenue mobilization has enabled the \ngovernment to significantly expand social assistance programs and regional transfers. However, \nthe fiscal impact of large external shocks, such as the natural disasters in Central Sulawesi and \nLombok in 2018 can put this at risk.8 \n \n6.  Financial exclusion is directly linked to inequality. Lack of access to financial products \nand services deprives the poor of income and livelihood opportunities and exposes them to \nfinancial risks arising from natural disasters and economic shocks.9 Indonesia has increased \nfinancial  inclusion  more  than  its  regional  comparators  from  2011  to  2017  (Figure  1).  The \nproportion of the adult population with a formal bank account was 49% in 2017, compared with \n36% in 2014 and 20% in 2011.10 Similarly, access to formal bank accounts by the poorest 40% \nof population in Indonesia increased to 37% in 2017 from 22% in 2014, and Indonesia has made \nimpressive gains in women\u2019s access to finance (51% in 2017 from 38% in 2014). Despite this \nprogress, over half of the adult population remains financially excluded. Inclusion levels among \nthe poorest 40% of the population and women are considerably lower than in Malaysia and \nThailand (Figure 2). Over one third of the unbanked adult population in Indonesia considers \ndistance to be a key reason for not having a formal bank account. Close to 70% own mobile \nphones, highlighting the significant opportunity for the use of mobile phone-based financial \ntechnology to overcome geographical barriers and increase financial inclusion, with a view to \nreaching the target of 75% by 2019. \n \nFigure 1: Financial Inclusion in Indonesia  Figure 2: Financial Inclusion in Indonesia and \nand Selected Association of Southeast  Selected Association of Southeast Asian \nAsian Nations Countries (2011\u20132017)  Nations Countries (2017) \n   \nSource: A.

A deep and resilient finance sector is essential for efficient financial intermediation \nand stable economic growth. Indonesia\u2019s finance sector has become more developed and \nstable over the program\u2019s implementation period (2013\u20132018). The finance sector (bank credit, \nstock market capitalization, and bonds) has grown from 103% of GDP in 2013 to about 117% of \nGDP in 2017. The trading volume of the bond market has also improved from an average of $66 \nbillion in 2015 to an average of $94 billion in 2018. Similarly, indicators of financial stability such \nas credit default swap spreads have declined from 2014 to 2018. However, some factors may still \nsubject the finance sector to instability; it is heavily reliant on bank intermediation, and foreign \nownership of the government bond market remains relatively high at about 38%. Financial \ninstability disrupts economic growth and impacts poor households disproportionately as they have \nfewer and less-diversified assets. Further reforms to diversify the finance sector, including by \ndeveloping the capital market, are required to deepen the finance sector, strengthen its stability, \nand make it more inclusive. \n \n8.  Binding constraints. The government and OJK recognize these challenges and have \nidentified three primary constraints: (i) an incomplete framework and coordination mechanism for \nfinancial stability; (ii) the shallow finance sector; and (iii) financial exclusion of poor households.11 \nThese constraints are discussed in paras. 9\u201313. \n \n9.  Incomplete framework and coordination mechanism for financial stability. The Law \non Prevention and Resolution of Financial System Crisis (Financial Stability Law) enacted in 2016 \nwas a significant reform in providing OJK with legal immunity that allows supervisors to perform \ntheir duty without fear of litigation. The law also provides OJK with the authority to require systemic \nbanks to increase their capital to mitigate financial crises. However, several constraints remain. \nFirst, implementing regulations, including those governing recovery plans and resolutions, need \nto be adopted. Similarly, the borrowing criteria for the deposit insurance corporation (LPS) in the \nbank resolution process needs to be clarified. Second, integrated implementation of OJK\u2019s master \nplan is required so that financial service providers offering the same services are treated similarly \nto avoid distortions and regulatory arbitrage. This requires coordination through a crosscutting \nsecretariat with a focus on the priority reform actions. Third, integrated supervision needs to be \nmore holistic so that financial conglomerates are better supervised. Indonesia\u2019s finance sector is \ncharacterized by the strong presence of financial conglomerates, some having a horizontal \nownership structure, which complicates supervision. Under the current regulatory framework, OJK \ndoes not have access to information on nonfinancial holding companies because they are not \nlicensed or regulated by OJK. \n \n10.  Shallow finance sector. Notwithstanding recent finance sector growth (para. 7), it is still \ndominated by banks. The size of the equity market in 2017 (51% of GDP) and market liquidity as \nmeasured by share turnover velocity (26%) are small relative to Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) comparators. Similarly, the size of the bond market equals 18% of GDP, with \ncorporate bonds representing only 3% of GDP. \n \n11.  Despite strong potential, Indonesia\u2019s corporate sukuk (sharia compliant bond) market \nrepresents just 4% of its overall sukuk market. A key constraint is uncertainty in relation to tax \ntreatment. Specifically, to comply with Islamic finance principles, issuance of sukuk requires \nmultiple asset transfers; given the lack of clarity on tax treatment, there is a risk that value-added \ntax (VAT) will be charged each time the asset is transferred. For investors, sukuk investment \nreturns may not be eligible for the same income tax deductions as their conventional counterparts. \nTherefore, corporate sukuks are less attractive to both potential issuers and investors. A recent \n                                                \n11 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nADB survey of underwriters and investors suggests that VAT neutrality and income tax deductions \nfor sukuk investments would provide impetus and incentives for the sukuk market to expand. \n \n12.  The government is committed to developing municipal bond markets, but the lack of legal \ncertainty on audit requirements has constrained subnational government bond issuances. OJK\u2019s \n2016 announcement that it would exempt municipal governments from undergoing additional \naudits from private auditors registered with OJK has yet to be codified in regulation. This potential \ndouble audit requirement increases the issuance cost for subnational governments. There is also \na need for clarity on the content of the bond prospectus, legal documents to be submitted by \nsubnational governments, and their post-issuance reporting obligations. \n \n13.  Financial exclusion. With over 17,500 islands, Indonesia faces significant geographical \nchallenges to achieving financial inclusion. Constraints include: (i) coordination among various \ngovernment agencies and other stakeholders is lacking and limits the implementation of financial \ninclusion activities; (ii) the regulatory framework covers only peer-to-peer lending, with no overall \nregulatory framework for the financial technology industry; (iii) the number of branchless banks \nand agents is insufficient given the large number of people that are financially excluded; and  \n(iv) a low level of financial literacy. The national financial literacy rate is 29%, with women having \nlower literacy than men. Furthermore, the lack of bank services in marginalized provinces, \ndisproportionately affects women as they have greater mobility constraints.     \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n14.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s reform agenda is anchored in the \nNational  Medium-Term Development  Plan for 2015\u20132019,  which  seeks  to reduce the Gini \ncoefficient to 0.36 and lower the poverty rate to 7%\u20138% by 2019 (footnote 7). The government \nrecognizes that promoting financial stability, deepening the financial market, and improving \naccess to financial services for the poor are integral to meeting these targets. The government\u2019s \nstrategy  consists  of  a  series  of  reforms,  including  implementing  OJK\u2019s  mandate  as  an \nindependent and integrated regulator, enacting the Financial Stability Law, and implementing \nregulations to safeguard financial stability. These reforms will be followed by measures to develop \nnew instruments in the capital market and a stronger focus on financial inclusion for poor \nhouseholds. The government launched the National Financial Inclusion Strategy in August 2016, \nwhich sets an ambitious target for 75% of the adult population to have access to financial services \nby 2019.12 In addition, based on the recommendations in the Financial Sector Assessment \nProgram of 2017, the government also launched the National Financial Market Development and \nDeepening Strategy, 2018-2024 to anchor reforms in the finance sector.13 \n \n15.  Proposed  policy  reforms.  The  program  supports  the  following  reform  areas:  \n(i) regulatory structure for financial stability strengthened; (ii) financial market deepened; and  \n(iii) financial inclusion enhanced. At the inception of subprogram 3, the government agreed to \ncomplete 10 prior actions (or triggers) and 12 policy milestones as the basis for subprogram 3.14 \nDuring the processing of subprogram 3, a new prior action was added to reflect OJK\u2019s approval \nof green bond regulations and the issuance of the first sovereign green sukuk. The policy \nmilestones on municipal bonds and the expansion of national health insurance were upgraded to \nprior actions to emphasize the importance of coordination between the government and OJK to \n                                                \n12 Government of Indonesia. 2016.

", "5 \nresolve constraints on the issuance of municipal bonds and to recognize the importance of \nnational health insurance to developing the demand side (investment) of the capital market. The \nchanges in the policy matrix are reflected in the revised design and monitoring framework (DMF) \n(Appendix 1). Subprogram 3 now contains 23 policy actions (13 prior actions representing high \nimpact reforms, and 10 policy milestones) all of which have been accomplished. \n \n16.  Regulatory structure for financial stability strengthened. This reform area builds on \naccomplishments in subprograms 1 and 2 that established OJK as an independent integrated \nregulator,  enacted  the  Financial  Stability  Law  that  provided  OJK  with  legal  immunity,  and \ndeveloped OJK\u2019s consolidated master plan 2015\u20132019. There were three main accomplishments \nin subprogram 3. First, OJK advanced implementation of its master plan and completed 90% of \npriority reforms ahead of schedule, including thematic risk-based surveillance, and simplification \nof both the process and documentation for small-scale capital market issuances. The reforms in \nthe master plan benefit women through the focus on financial inclusion and literacy. Monitoring of \nthe master plan is coordinated through a central secretariat with quarterly reporting to the Board \nof Commissioners.  \n \n17.  Second, OJK issued three regulations to implement the Financial Stability Law adopting \na risk-based approach to supervision by: (i) determining level of supervision based on the risk \nprofile of each bank; (ii) providing procedures to establish bridge banks for orderly resolution of \nbanks that cannot be recapitalized; and (iii) introducing a comprehensive regulatory framework \non how systemic banks report to OJK. The Center of Financial Sector Policies (PKSK), Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) led government coordination efforts to safeguard financial stability, including \nthe issuance of regulations (i) to allow the deposit insurance corporation to borrow from the \ngovernment, and (ii) on procedures to write off assets for banking restructuring. Third, OJK has \ndrafted  a  regulation  requiring  that  all  financial  conglomerates  set  up  holding  companies, \neffectively  converting  conglomerates  into  vertical  structures  (a  holding  company  with \nsubsidiaries). Integrated supervision, especially of financial conglomerates, provides OJK with a \nframework to monitor and mitigate operational and systemic risks. The outcome is an integrated \nrisk rating for each financial conglomerate. \n \n18.  Financial  market  deepened.  This  reform  area  builds  on  accomplishments  in \nsubprograms 1 and 2, including implementation of international prudential standards for Islamic \nfinance  related  to  governance  and  collective  investment  schemes.  There  were  four  key \naccomplishments in subprogram 3. First, the government and OJK took concrete steps to facilitate \nthe issuance of municipal bonds. OJK issued regulations to eliminate overlapping requirements \nand provided clear guidance on issuance requirements, which: (i) accept audits performed by the \nSupreme Audit Board for issuances, eliminating the need for a second audit by a private auditor; \n(ii) require subnational governments to disclose projects that will be funded by the issuance; and \n(iii) simplify reporting requirements. The Central Java subnational government subsequently \nmade preparations to issue bonds by allocating funds in its budget and preparing a prospectus. \n \n19.  Second, OJK issued green bond regulations that require potential issuers to disclose the \ncredentials of external reviewers who validate that the projects will be environmentally friendly \nthroughout the tenure of the bond. This is consistent with the Green Principles of the International \nCapital Market Association and the ASEAN Green Bond Principles. In February 2018, the \ngovernment  took  the  lead  with  the  issuance  of the  world\u2019s first  sovereign green  sukuk  of  \n$1.25 billion. The issuance will fund green infrastructure, including renewable energy, sustainable \ntransport, and waste management projects. The third accomplishment is on Islamic finance. The \nMOF has finalized revisions to the VAT law that will exempt the underlying assets of corporate \nsukuk from VAT, providing the needed tax neutrality. Concurrently, OJK has implemented all \n ", "6 \ninternational Islamic finance prudential standards for capital market as issued by the Islamic \nFinancial Services Board. This provides a regulatory environment to enable Islamic finance to \ndevelop and grow in a sustainable manner in line with international standards. Finally, the national \nhealth insurance reforms increased the number of beneficiaries from about 177 million in 2017 to \n208 million in 2018, including 103 million women. Strengthening domestic institutional investors, \nsuch as insurance and pension, is crucial for capital market development. \n \n20.  Financial inclusion enhanced. This reform area builds on accomplishments during \nsubprograms  1  and  2,  including  the  launch  of  the  branchless  banking  initiative  and  the \nestablishment of the National Council for Financial Inclusion (NCFI). There were four major \naccomplishments under this output during subprogram 3. First, OJK approved expansion of the \nbranchless banking initiative with a significant increase in the number of agents, cities and districts \nserved, which help provide financial services to marginalized provinces and populations. OJK \nalso revised information collection for branchless banking to include sex-disaggregated data for \nagents and customers. This will enable banks to analyze the gender profiles of agents and \ncustomers to help banks improve their services. Measures were also taken to balance expansion \nand consumer protection. Participating banks are required to comply with strict security measures \nin the recruitment of agents, and to train and monitor them in order to prevent fraudulent activities. \nThe effect of these reforms can be seen in the number of new account holders which increased \nsignificantly from approximately 5 million in 2017 to 22 million in 2018. \n \n21.  Second, to improve financial literacy, OJK implemented online e-modules based on the \ntextbooks approved by the Ministry of National Education for elementary, junior high, and senior \nhigh school students; and conducted 40 financial literacy programs targeting women, youth, and \nmigrant workers. Third, OJK consolidated its financial inclusion and financial technology activities \nby launching the OJK Infinity (Innovation Centre for Digital Financial Technology) to promote \ncollaboration among regulators, the government, and industries. Finally, OJK also issued digital \nfinance  regulations  that  map  out  the  requirements  for  financial  technology  companies  to \nparticipate in the regulatory sandbox and detail the licensing and reporting requirements for equity \ncrowd funding.  \n \n22.  Post-program partnership framework. The P3F provides for a structured dialogue over \nthe medium term and represents a tripartite partnership between ADB, the government, and OJK \nto advance finance sector reforms supported by ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA).15 Key activities \nunder the P3F include the development of a geospatial financial services mobile application to \nenhance access to finance by enabling consumers to locate the agents providing branchless \nbanking, and the development of a 5-year financial technology road map. In addition, the P3F will \nfocus on youth and include activities such as the development of a national youth financial \ninclusion strategy to promote access to finance for youth between 16 and 30 years of age. \n \n23.  ADB  experience.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  with  the  government  on  finance  sector \ndevelopment recognizes the need to adopt a building-block approach based on sequential \ndevelopment of the sector. This approach allowed ADB to engage and channel critical support \nbased on the different stages and evolution of the sector (Figure 3). One of the most significant \nmilestones is the establishment of the OJK as a unified and independent regulator in 2012, which \ncan be traced back to ADB\u2019s assistance starting in 1999. ADB\u2019s assistance started by supporting \nthe basic legal requirements for Indonesia\u2019s finance sector covering all subsectors. This included \ndesigning  the  know  your  customer  rules  for  the  banking  sector,  developing  a  corporate \n                                                \n15 Support for the PPPF will be provided through ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance for Promoting Innovative Financial \nInclusion. Manila. ", "7 \ngovernance framework in the capital market and revising the insurance and pension laws. This \nwas followed by focused support to develop the capital market by strengthening surveillance and \ndeveloping the primary dealer system for government debt securities. After OJK was established \nin 2012, the government requested ADB to focus on the institutional governance reforms of OJK \nand the coordination capacity of MOF. This was accomplished by developing OJK\u2019s technical and \nregulatory capacities as an independent and unified regulator. ADB also helped the government \ndevelop and coordinate finance sector policies through the newly established PKSK. Given the \nimportance of financial inclusion to reducing poverty and inequality, the FMDIP program began \nADB\u2019s engagement in financial inclusion. Looking ahead, ADB will continue focusing on reforms \nto  improve  access  to  financial  services  especially  through  financial  technology,  innovative \nfinancial  literacy  programs  and stronger  consumer  protection.  ADB\u2019s finance  sector  reform \nprograms complement ADB\u2019s other programs on public finance linked to sustainable development \ngoals and the investment climate.16 \n \nFigure 3: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Finance Sector Development in Indonesia \n2017\nSuprogram 2\nTA -Dedicated \nsupport for financial \n2012           inclusion\nFinancial \nDevelopment \nand \nIntegration \nProgram \n2019 \n2015  Proposed  2021 \n2002  Financial Market  subprogram  Dedicated financial \nFinancial \nGovernance  Development and  inclusion sector \nand Social  Inclusion Program,  development \nSecurity  C2a0p0it7a l    subprogram 1 program (planned) \nTA -Support \nProgram  \nMarket  government OJK \nDevelopment \non finance sector \nProgram \nreforms\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FI = financial inclusion, OJK = Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (Financial Services \nAuthority), TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n24.  Lessons. ADB\u2019s experience in the finance sector has informed the program design \nthrough four key  lessons.  First,  developing  an  integrated finance  sector  regulator requires \nsequential steps, beginning with issuing legislation, and providing the regulator with legal and \nfiscal autonomy, as well as legal immunity to enable it to perform its supervisory function. ADB \nprovided support during the subprograms in setting up and operationalizing OJK as an integrated \nregulator. Second, even independent regulators require strong and coordinated support from the \ngovernment, especially for passing enabling legislation. The PKSK has taken the lead in providing \nsuch support.  Third, developing the capital market should be guided by a roadmap comprising \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2018.

Fourth, \nfinancial  inclusion,  literacy  and  consumer  protection  reforms  must  consider  advances  in \ntechnology. While financial technology provides new opportunities to enhance access, it also \nposes its own challenges, especially in terms of regulation, supervision and consumer protection. \nTherefore, the development of financial technology requires not just specific product or service-\nlevel regulations but an overarching financial technology framework. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the program design and implementation. ADB\u2019s long-term \nengagement and structured policy dialogue with the government and OJK helped prioritize and \nsequence legal, policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms in support of an efficient, resilient, and \ninclusive finance sector. The TA associated with the programmatic approach has helped to ensure \nthat policy actions are well formulated and coordinated among the different stakeholders, and \nproperly sequenced in line with best practice, local context and capacities.18  Through the TA, \nADB  supported the  implementation  of OJK\u2019s  consolidated  master  plan,  including  providing \ncapacity-building support to the cross-sector secretariat to monitor implementation of the plan. \nADB  also  helped  the  government  develop  Islamic  finance  through  an  analysis  of  the  tax \nimplications of corporate sukuk, based on surveys and engagements with the private sector \n(underwriters and issuers), and investors. ADB extended support at the subnational government \nlevel by helping the Central Java government prepare its first issuance of municipal bonds. ADB \nsupported the PKSK and OJK in several key areas, which included leveraging digital technology \nto convert financial literacy material into game-based online modules for students. In addition, \nADB\u2019s assessment of the role of digital finance directly informed several policy measures.19 \nFinally, regional TA for capital market integration mapped OJK\u2019s corporate governance and green \nbond regulations against international standards, including the ASEAN Corporate Governance \nScorecard and the ASEAN Green Bond Standards, which were jointly launched by ADB and the \nASEAN Capital Market Forum.20 \n \n26.  Development partner coordination. Close coordination between ADB, the International \nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, and other development partners has resulted in programmatic \nsynergies in the finance sector. Coordination is demonstrated by ADB\u2019s support to implement \nselected recommendations from the Financial Sector Assessment Program undertaken by the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Coordination for the program is based on the \ngovernment\u2019s process through PKSK. ADB supports the NCFI together with the World Bank and \nother development partners. The financial inclusion division of the PKSK, which ADB supports, \nleads the working group on policies and regulations. ADB also jointly reviews proposed revisions \nto national laws with development partners, including the World Bank and the Australia-Indonesia \nPartnership for Economic Development. Finally, ADB also coordinates with the advisor from the \nUnited States Department of the Treasury on public\u2013private partnership infrastructure projects, \nincluding developing the framework for necessary capital market products. \n \n \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2017.

The  impact  of  the  reform  program  is  demonstrated  by  performance  relative  to  the \nindicators in the DMF, which has exceeded the targets set during subprogram 1 (footnote 4). The \nsize of the finance sector as a percentage of GDP has grown by approximately 14% (2014 to \n2017). Access to financial services for the poorest 40% has improved from 22% in 2014 to 37% \nin 2017. Therefore, the DMF targets for 2020 have been revised upwards. The program impact \nassessment estimates that the potential net present value of benefits of the program ranges from \nabout $2.7 billion to $5.7 billion.21 Benefits are derived from reforms such as removal of VAT from \nsukuk, and reduction in government\u2019s cost of borrowing through financial stability. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n28.  The government has requested a single tranche loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 3.22 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years with straight-line repayment method; an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB. The loan size is based on Indonesia\u2019s financing needs, the development impact \nof the policy reform package, and development spending arising from the reforms. For 2019, the \ngovernment\u2019s projected total gross borrowing requirement is estimated at $59.6 billion. To finance \nthe deficit, the government plans to raise approximately $53.4 billion from the issuance of \nsecurities, and approximately $5.9 billion from official development assistance. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  The implementation period for subprogram 3 is from April 2017 to January 2019. The \nFiscal Policy Agency in the MOF is the executing agency while OJK is the implementing agency. \nThe PKSK in coordination with OJK\u2019s International Department will monitor implementation of the \npolicy actions under the policy matrix. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n30.  Safeguards.  Subprogram  3  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous people. \n \n31.  Poverty and social. Subprogram 3 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at \nentry. One of the key components of the program concerns enhancing financial inclusion and \nensuring improved access to finance for the poor; unbanked; and micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises. Women entrepreneurs face unique challenges because of limitations in time, mobility, \nand resources. OJK completed a diagnostic study on the role of financial technology for financing \nof  micro,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  including  how  it  can  benefit  women \nmicroentrepreneurs. The assessment provided OJK with policy recommendations to address \nchallenges faced by women in getting access to financial services. In addition, branchless banking \nbrings financial services to remote households and benefits women. The government and OJK \n                                                \n21 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of link documents in Appendix 2). \n22 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n ", "10 \nhave paid special attention to increasing access by and the literacy of women. OJK\u2019s targeted \nprograms for women have contributed to 51% of women having access to formal bank accounts. \nContinued efforts have also been made to enhance production of sex-disaggregated data through \nthe National Health Insurance and branchless banking information systems. \n \n32.  Governance. In 2017, Indonesia scored either A or B (both considered above basic \nalignment with international good practice) on 17 out of 31 indicators in the World Bank\u2019s Public \nExpenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment Report.23 Indicators with particularly good \nassessment results include transparency of public finance, and accounting and reporting. The \nlegal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  public  financial  management  were  strengthened  by \ngovernment  regulations  issued  in  2017  mandating  coordination  between  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and the MOF in planning and budgeting. ADB \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  governance  reform  through  its  Fiscal  and  Public  Expenditure \nManagement Program (footnote 16). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \n33.  Risk and mitigating measures. Three key risks have been identified in the program. First \nis  macroeconomic  risk,  particularly  in  relation  to  tighter  global  financial  conditions.  This  is \nmitigated by Indonesia\u2019s sound macroeconomic fundamentals, and appropriate monetary and \nfiscal policies. Second, changes in Indonesia\u2019s political economy may slow the pace of reform; \nthis risk is mitigated by OJK\u2019s legal and operational independence from the government, with its \ncommissioners being only in the second year of their 5-year terms. Finally, the risk of insufficient \ncoordination on finance sector reforms may affect the pace and quality of reforms. In financial \ninclusion, this risk is mitigated by the establishment of the NCFI in 2017 to coordinate all financial \ninclusion activities. In addition, reforms on stability and capital market development are closely \ncoordinated between OJK and PKSK in the MOF. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $500,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 3 of the Financial Market \nDevelopment and Inclusion Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n5 March 2019\n                                                \n23 World Bank. 2017.
