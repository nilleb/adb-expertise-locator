INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support improved integration of \npoverty alleviation and ecological protection efforts in Jiangxi Province of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC). It will explore the influence of the rare-earth mineral sector on poverty alleviation \nand environmental outcomes in  Jiangxi Province, and prepare policy recommendations for \nimproved integration of poverty alleviation and ecological protection efforts in the province, with \nGanzhou Prefecture as a focal area. \n \n2.  The Government of the PRC requested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nresearch on improving ecological protection and poverty alleviation outcomes of the rare-earth \nsector in Jiangxi. The TA is included in the country operations business plan for the PRC, 2017\u2013\n2019.1 In October 2017, ADB reached agreement with the Jiangxi Committee of the Chinese \nPeople\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (JPPCC) on the TA\u2019s proposed outcome and outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, terms of reference for consultants, and implementation schedule.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Rural poverty is widespread in Jiangxi Province, with 25 counties included in the national \nlist of identified poverty-stricken counties, including much of the Luoxiao Mountains contiguous \narea. Poverty alleviation is high on the agenda of the Jiangxi Provincial Government (JPG), as \npart of national efforts under the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020).3 However, efforts \nhave focused heavily on development of resource-intensive industries as engines for increasing \neconomic growth. The mineral sector is a major contributor to Jiangxi Province\u2019s economy, with \nrare-earth extraction and processing the most significant subsector. \n \n4.  Rare-earth minerals are a series of 17 chemical elements that are essential raw materials \nfor  many  ubiquitous  modern  technologies,  including  consumer  electronics,  computers  and \ncommunications, healthcare, advanced transportation, and clean energy. In the 1990s, the PRC \nbecame the largest global supplier of rare-earth minerals, with significant reserves developed in \nInner Mongolia, Jiangxi, and Sichuan. While development of these natural capital assets has \nprovided opportunities for economic growth, there are increasing problems of water pollution, \nbiodiversity loss, erosion, and deteriorating agricultural productivity. Economic performance has \nmasked the negative impacts of pollution and degradation of natural capital. Such development \nis unsustainable, limits economic prosperity over the longer term, and is contrary to the PRC\u2019s \nbroader goals of building an ecological civilization. \n \n5.  Ganzhou is a prefecture of approximately 39,400 square kilometers in the south of Jiangxi \nProvince bordering Fujian Province to the east, Guangdong Province to the south, and Hunan \nProvince to the west. Approximately 70% of its area is forested, and over 80% is mountainous. \nGanzhou holds the headwaters of two significant river systems. The Gan River, one of five major \nrivers in Jiangxi Province, rises in Ganzhou before flowing north to the Poyang Lake, the largest \nfreshwater lake in the PRC, and to the Yangtze River. The Dongjiang River rises in Xunwu County \nof Ganzhou, flowing south and into the Pearl River. These river systems are significant for \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2017\u20132019. \nManila.  The original title of the TA was \u201cResearch on Integrated Development Mode of Targeted Poverty Alleviation \nand Ecological Protection in Jiangxi.\u201d \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 January 2018.  \n3  Government of the PRC. 2015. Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132020. Beijing. \n ", "2 \nagricultural  production,  fisheries,  and  domestic  consumption;  and  are  heavily  impacted  by \npollution from rare-earth mineral extraction and processing. \n \n6.  Ganzhou contains over 30 explored rare-earth minerals, gold, uranium, lead, and zinc \ndeposits, and is colloquially known as the \u201cKingdom of Rare Earths.\u201d The rare-earth mineral \nreserves are particularly high quality, containing high percentage of target elements and low level \nof radioactivity. However, the development of rare-earth minerals has already caused substantial \ndamage to the local ecology, with limited economic benefits for local communities. In 2012, the \nPRC\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology estimated that for Ganzhou alone, the \ncost of remediation for the heavily polluted rare-earth mineral mining areas could be up to \nCNY38.0 billion (equivalent to about $5.8 billion). \n \n7.  The root causes of the rare-earth mineral sector\u2019s poor environmental performance and \nlimited contribution to poverty alleviation are complex. Rapidly increasing global demand for these \nelements  has  resulted  in  a  massively  increased  and  under-regulated  supply  that  has  not \neffectively incorporated the environmental costs of production and processing. Black market \nproduction and smuggling are common across the supply and processing chain. Incentives for \nimproved environmental production and remediation technologies are low, while data limitations \nconstrain local planning capacity, monitoring, and regulatory oversight. Poorer rural communities \nmost affected by local environmental damage are often among those with least access to the \neconomic opportunities of the rare-earth minerals industrial value chain. Inclusive governance, \nincentives, and financing for increased local processing and value chain additions are lacking. \n \n8.  The government has commenced a series of reforms aimed at restructuring and improving \nregulation of the market to promote the healthy development and sustainability of the rare-earth \nmineral industry. In 2011, the State Council issued \u201cOpinions on Promoting the Sustainable and \nHealthy Development of Rare-Earth Enterprises,\u201d with the Ministry of Environmental Protection \nmandated  to  perform  environmental  inspections  and  verification  of  rare-earth  enterprises. \nHowever, the domestic reform process has been complicated by global trade dynamics and \ninvolvement of international stakeholders. In 2014, the European Union, Japan, and the United \nStates  of  America  lodged  a  dispute  with  the  World  Trade  Organization  over  the  PRC\u2019s \nmechanisms for controlling exports of rare-earth mineral products through quotas and duties. In \n2015, the PRC accepted the resolution of the World Trade Organization and agreed to withdraw \nits export quota system. The Rare-Earth Industry Development Plan (2016\u20132020) highlights the \ngovernment\u2019s future intentions to increase consolidation of market suppliers, limit black market \noperations, and improve environmental performance.4 Jiangxi Province is recognized as an \nimportant location for the PRC\u2019s increasing environmental focus. It has been identified as one of \nthree ecological civilization test zones in the PRC and one of five pilot areas for the country\u2019s \ngreen finance initiatives.5 The TA will assist JPG through JPPCC to deliver inclusive economic \ngrowth with improved environmental sustainability in Jiangxi Province, supporting the PRC\u2019s \necological civilization objectives. \n \n9.  Lessons. The TA builds on ongoing and previous projects in Jiangxi Province, including \nthe Strategy for Inclusive and Green Development of Small Cities, Towns, and Villages in Jiangxi \nProvince; the Jiangxi Pingxiang Integrated Rural\u2013Urban Infrastructure Development Project; the \n                                                \n4  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. 2016.
