INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Heart  of  Borneo  (HOB),  covering  about  22  million  hectares  and  comprising \napproximately one-third of the island of Borneo,1 is among the world\u2019s top priority areas for \nconservation.2 Its  large  carbon  sequestration  and  storage  capacity  makes  it  an  important \ncomponent of the fast shrinking band of equatorial forests that function as the \u2015lungs of the earth.\u2016 \nThe ecosystem services provided by the HOB have significant impact on the lives of about 12 \nmillion local and indigenous peoples, including over 200 Dayak groups,3 who depend heavily on \nits resources for their subsistence. The Indonesian Borneo ecosystem services contribute about \n11% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product.4 \n2.  As the HOB is one of a few areas on earth where large-scale conservation can still be \nimplemented, the Government of Indonesia, through the Ministry of Forestry, requested Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the capacity of public and \nprivate sector institutions in sustainable biodiversity and forest management in the HOB. The TA \nresponds to this request. 5 It will address the need to conserve the remaining forests of the HOB, \nwhich is a global and regional concern, and will support government agencies in fulfilling the \nobjectives of the HOB National Strategic Plan of Action (NSPA) (2009\u20132013).6 With cofinancing \nfrom the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the TA aims to improve the management of natural \nresources  in  the  HOB  Indonesia  by  providing  technical  and  operations  support  for  (i) \nstrengthening policies and institutions for sustainable forest and biodiversity management, (ii) \nstrengthening  government  capacity  to  develop  sustainable  local  community  livelihood \nopportunities  and  sustainable financing  schemes,  including  piloting  payment for  ecosystem \nservices (PES) financing schemes for forest and biodiversity management; and (iii) improving \nland use and forestry practices. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Weaknesses in natural resource governance. Indonesia has numerous national and \nlocal laws governing the use of its natural resources. However conflicting provisions, perverse \nincentives  for  unsustainable  use,  ambiguity  in  procedures  and  area  of  responsibility,  and \nincongruence with customary laws mean that national agencies and local units are unable to \neffectively carry out natural resource management responsibilities, especially under its current \ndecentralized management regime. The result is an actual open access regime in many areas with \ncritical resource stocks. During 1997\u20131998, more than half of the timber harvested in Kalimantan \nwas illegal (footnote 2). Each year, about 1 million cubic meters of timber are smuggled from \nKalimantan to Sabah. The revenue losses incurred in the 1990s due to smuggling are reckoned \nto be over $580 million.7 In addition to foregone revenue from illegal activities, the area is left \nwith denuded and destroyed forests, threatened biodiversity, lost livelihood opportunities, and \n                                                \n1  The territory of Borneo is divided among three countries: (i) Brunei Darussalam in the northwest covering about 0.3 \nmillion hectares; (ii) Sarawak, Malaysia covering about 3.4 million hectares along the northwest coast and Sabah, \nMalaysia  covering  about  5.8  million  hectares  along  the  northeastern  tip  of  Borneo;  and  (iii)  Indonesia  for \nKalimantan Island covering about 12.5 million hectares. \n2  WWF.  2005.

The government needs to enhance policies and capacity to \nestablish an enabling environment for more effective and sustainable resource utilization and \nmanagement of the HOB. \n4.  Deficiencies in land use and spatial planning. Local units involved in HOB management \nprepare land use and spatial plans based on limited geographic information on the state of natural \necosystems in the HOB and key conservation management indicators. This creates problems for \ndetermining the extent to which these plans support the objectives of the HOB NSPA and relevant \nnational plans, including the Long-Term Forestry Development Plan and the National Strategy on \nReducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  Forest  Degradation  (REDD)  and  REDD+. 8 \nImplementation of these plans has also been less than effective due to inadequate national and \nlocal logistical, financial, and technical capacity. The completion and implementation of land use \nand spatial plans, and the establishment of permanent forest estates based on these plans are \nconsidered as requisite starting points in enhancing HOB management. \n5.   Inadequate  management,  funding,  and  limited  expanse  of  conservation  areas. \nNational parks and other areas set aside for conservation are vital for maintaining the ecological \nintegrity  of the  HOB and  serve  as the  cornerstone  of any  protection effort. However,  areas \nestablished as national parks are insufficient\u2014comprising only about 20% of the Indonesian HOB. \nThey all have inadequate funding and serious management constraints, which compromise their \neffectiveness.  The  management  constraints  include  lack  of  sustainable  financing,  technical \ncapability, management systems, and logistics. \n6.  Insufficient incentives for sustainable resource management. Ecosystem goods and \nservices are exploited for free or with minimal payment\u2014insufficient to finance the management of \nthe services. The absence of policies to facilitate internalization of economic values of ecosystem \nservices and appropriate incentives for sustainable land-use practices in the HOB has led to \noverexploitation, low investment in value-added processes, and high environmental externalities, \ndepriving  the  government  of  much  needed  funds  for  law  enforcement  and  natural  resource \nmanagement operations. Appropriate economic instruments, therefore, should be developed and \nimplemented to generate funds for improved governance and sustainable forest management and \nconservation. \n7.  The TA aims to address these persistent issues and problems that contribute to the \ndegradation of forest resources within the Indonesian HOB, consistent with the country and sector \nstrategy of the government for sustainable biodiversity and forest management. The TA objective \nis consistent with the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry Strategic Plan (2010\u20132014), the National \nAction Plan for Greenhouse Gas Emission, National Draft Strategy for REDD (Readiness Phase, \n2009\u20132012)9 and the HOB NSPA. The TA incorporates lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience \ndeveloping a national REDD+ program in Indonesia10 as part of the Forest Investment Program \n(FIP).11 Furthermore, the HOB initiative is one of the strategic pillars for subregional cooperation \nunder the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013the Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area12 \n                                                \n8  REDD+ goes beyond deforestation and forest degradation, and includes the role of conservation, sustainable \nmanagement of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.  \n9  These  plans  reflect  Indonesia\u2019s  priorities  for  forest  management,  which  include  combating  illegal  logging, \nrehabilitation, conservation of forest and securing forest areas, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \n10 Some lessons learned include (i) the importance of working with decentralized governance structures such as \nforest management units, to improve their capacity and skills for community based forest management; (ii) \nengaging the private sector as an important change agent to protect the HOB, and (iii) strengthening knowledge \ntransfer between districts, provinces, and communities on forest management, particularly on spatial planning. \n11The TA design complements Indonesia\u2019s Forest Investment Program (FIP), endorsed by the FIP subcommittee in \nNovember 2012 (https://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org/cif/node/10699) and dovetails with a proposed ADB grant \n(Sustainable Forest and Biodiversity Management in Borneo, funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n12 The United Nations Development Programme is working closely with the Government of Malaysia in designing and \nimplementing the Malaysia portion of the HOB to complement ADB\u2019s focus on the Indonesian part of HOB. \n ", "  3 \nand  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations. 13  It  supports  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to \nenvironmentally sustainable growth under Strategy 202014 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy,15 the fourth pillar of which is cooperation in regional public \ngoods. ADB\u2019s country strategy emphasizes strengthening environmental and natural resource \nmanagement in Indonesia. The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2013\u2013\n2014.16  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be the sustainable use of forest resources in the HOB area in Indonesia, \nwhich will be measured by the increase in forest cover, carbon sequestration capacity, and gross \ndomestic product of villages in protected areas. The outcome will be the improved management \nof natural resources and biodiversity in four districts17 in the HOB area in Indonesia as reflected \nby the reduction of forest loss and incidence of wildlife and biodiversity poaching. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  adopts  a  programmatic  approach.  The  implementation  plan  incorporates \nstrategies  for  (i)  promoting  participation  among  multisector  and  multilevel  stakeholders  to \nstrengthen  commitment  and  ownership,  (ii)  streamlining  efforts  and  interventions  to  avoid \noverlaps  and  consolidating  support  for  field  activities  to  maximize  impacts  on  intended \nbeneficiaries, and (iii) developing a coordinated and synergistic response to the management of \nHOB forest ecosystems based on an integrated landscape-based management approach. The \nTA will have four main outputs. \n10.  Output  1:  Policy  and  institutions  for  sustainable  forest  and  biodiversity \nmanagement strengthened.18 The TA will improve the management capacity of public and \nprivate institutions that are working in the HOB, particularly in implementing district HOB action \nplans and relevant forestry management plans. Capacity building interventions will be designed \nbased on identified institutional weaknesses and strengths to carry out a policy reform agenda \nfor forest resource management in line with the country\u2019s National Strategy on REDD, Ministry of \nForestry  Strategic  Plan  of  Action  (2010\u20132014),  and  the  HOB  NSPA.  Regional  (trilateral) \ninterventions  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  the  evolving  HOB  initiative  by  focusing  on \nstrategies  for  strengthening  tri-country  cooperation  and  coordination  through  tri-country \nworkshops,  regular  dialogue,  and  regional  conferences.  The  TA  will  use  strategic \ncommunications  and  knowledge  products  to  engage  key  stakeholders  (local  governments, \nprivate sector and communities) to nurture the expertise required to apply financial models and \ndesign business investments based on ecosystem values. \n11.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  existing  collaborative  management  scheme  in  Kayan \nMentarang National Park and in the districts of Malinau and Nunukan in East Kalimantan, which \nencompass the national park, by (i) facilitating the approval of the park\u2019s boundary and its field \ndemarcation;  (ii)  finalizing  delineation  of  zones  in  the  11  territories  in  the  park,  including \ndeveloping  the  buffer  zone  framework;  (iii)  conducting  capacity  building  interventions  for \nincreasing  knowledge  and  skills  of  local  stakeholders  by  establishing  village  conservation \n                                                \n13 Support to the HOB consistent with the emphasis on promoting sustainable forest management under  the \n\u2015environmental sustainability\u2016 theme outlined in the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community Blueprint of the Roadmap \nfor ASEAN Community, 2009\u20132015. \n14 ADB. 2008.

Output 2: Land use and forestry practices improved.19 The TA will strengthen the \nexisting land use planning system to effectively reduce forest conversion and degradation. It will \nestablish baseline estimates on greenhouse gas emissions for the HOB and strengthen capacity \non REDD+ preparedness, particularly of local communities. The TA will establish four REDD+ \ndemonstration  sites.20 From  these  demonstration  areas,  two  pilot  sites  will  be  selected  to \nundertake key activities, including (i) developing the REDD+ collaborative plan; (ii) defining the \nreduction emission level; and (iii) formulating a monitoring, reporting, and verification system to \nmonitor the impact of interventions and benefit sharing. Gender analysis will be conducted and \nsocial safeguard requirements will be integrated to promote active community participation in \nthe implementation of REDD+ pilot projects. The REDD+ demonstration activities will be linked \nand/or integrated into the carbon markets or other forms of voluntary REDD payment schemes \nbefore project completion. The TA will also identify investments for possible financing under the \nForest  Investment  Program,  and  may  include  replication  of  pilot  initiatives  in  other  sites, \nexpansion of geographic coverage, or introduction of innovations to enhance REDD+ impacts.21 \n \n13.  Output  3:  Potential  PES  and  sustainable  financing  schemes  for  forest  and \nbiodiversity  management  identified  and  developed. 22  The  TA  will  identify  potential \nsustainable  financing  and  PES  schemes  to  help  sustain  the  implementation  of  protection, \nconservation, and development activities in the HOB, emphasizing the optimum benefits to local \nstakeholders. In-depth supply chain studies will be undertaken of four industries (e.g., mining, \npalm oil, rubber, and tourism) that are expanding on a large scale with increasingly adverse \nimpacts  on  the  integrity  of  HOB  forest  resources.  The  studies  will  provide  the  basis  for \nparticipatory design and pilot testing of PES mechanisms in two sites and the generation of \nrevenues for environmental service providers. The piloting of PES schemes will be implemented \nin the two project sites (e.g., Malinau and Nunukan districts in East Kalimantan and Melawi and \nKapuas Hulu districts in West Kalimantan). Lessons and best practices will be formulated into a \nsustainable financing operations manual for application in other districts. \n \n14.  Output  4:  Project  management  services  delivered. 23  The  Directorate  of \nEnvironmental Services and Conservation Areas (DESCA) of the Ministry of Forestry will serve \nas the executing agency for the TA. It will establish a project management office (PMO) in \nBogor and TA implementation units at the district level to coordinate, supervise, and manage \nactivities. ADB will engage a project management consultant (PMC) firm to implement and \nmanage the TA, in coordination with the PMO. ADB will conduct in-country clinics to strengthen \nDESCA capacity for procurement and financial aspects. A monitoring, reporting, and verification \nsystem will be installed to monitor and evaluate the TA impacts. The TA will provide guidance in \nharmonizing the systems for carbon accounting and ecosystem valuation across sectors and \nagencies and establish provincial, district, and community roles in the system. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,477,273 equivalent, of which (i) $1,250,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund;24 (ii) $700,000 will be financed on a \n                                                \n19 The Climate Change Fund will provide about $1.125 million to fund TA interventions under output 2. \n20 Two in Kayan Mentarang National Park and one each in the Melawi and Kapuas Hulu districts in West Kalimantan. \n21 These  will  be  based  on  demonstrated  feasibility  and  degree  of  contribution  to  biodiversity  conservation, \nenhancement of carbon absorption capacity, household income generation, and improved community welfare. \n22 The GEF will provide about $0.947 million to fund TA interventions under output 3. \n23 Project management costs of about $1.075 million will be funded by the GEF (about $0.250 million), the Climate \nChange Fund (about $0.125 million), and the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund (about $0.70 million). \n24  Established by ADB. \n ", "  5 \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund (footnote 24); and (iii) $2,527,273 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the GEF, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, transport, remuneration, per \ndiem for counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. Appendix 2 provides details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  Executing and implementing agencies.  DESCA will serve as the executing agency \nand  the  location  of  the  PMO. Three  project  implementation  units  will  be  established  at  the \nfollowing locations: (i) Kapuas Hulu, West Kalimantan; (ii) Melawi District, West Kalimantan; and \n(iii)  Malinau  and  Nunukan,  East  Kalimantan  to  coordinate,  supervise,  and  manage  project \nactivities in the four districts. 25 Authority will be delegated by the executing agency to the \nMinistry of Forestry conservation offices or national park offices to manage field activities as well \nas coordinate with HOB working groups at the provincial and district levels. The PMO may also \nengage universities, nongovernment organizations, private institutions, and/or companies to \nimplement specific studies or activities. TA implementation is targeted from September 2013 to \nAugust 2016. \n17.  Project  management. The PMO will comprise counterpart government professional \nstaff, support staff services, and consultants deployed as part of the PMC. The PMC will assist \nthe PMO in administering, managing, and supervising TA activities, and in providing technical \ndirection  for  detailed  TA  planning  and  implementation.  The  PMC  will  also  assist  PMO  in \nrecruiting individual consultants and/or institutions. The PMO will establish links with the HOB \nNational Working Group and liaise with relevant ADB units and/or offices. It will coordinate, \nmanage, supervise, and implement TA activities through relevant government agencies in each \nof the four districts. \n18.  Consulting services. The TA will require international (39 person-months) and national \n(108  person-months)  technical  and  management  consulting  services.  ADB  will  recruit  the \nconsultants (through an international consulting firm that will serve as the PMC) using quality- \nand cost-based selection (80:20) in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be engaged following a semi-delegated \ntechnical assistance in which ADB will be charged with consultant recruitment on behalf of the \nPMO and in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the hiring of consultants. All procurement and disbursements will follow \nADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).26 The outline terms \nof reference of the consultants are presented in Appendix 3, and the detailed terms of reference \nof the consultants are provided in a supplementary appendix.27 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,527,273 to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Global Environment Facility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $1,950,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Indonesia for Sustainable \nForest and Biodiversity Management in Borneo. \n \n                                                \n25 The project implementation unit in East Kalimantan will be shared by Malinau and Nunukan districts.
