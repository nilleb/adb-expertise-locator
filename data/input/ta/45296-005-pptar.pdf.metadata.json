The government has requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nmodernize public transport systems in the City of Davao in line with Presidential Administration \nOrder  No.  254.1 This  high  priority  project  for  the  government  builds  on  previous  support \nprovided by ADB to the City of Davao under a policy and advisory technical assistance (TA).2 \nThe project preparatory TA is necessary to prepare the project design, financing arrangements, \nsocial dimensions, and institutional strengthening. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The Project includes the development of improved public transport operations that will \ncover the full urban area and cater for the growth in travel demand at the cities expanding edges. \nThe project will overhaul the outdated services that provide a poor level of service in terms of \ncoverage  area,  hours  of  operation,  and  passenger  comfort  and  facilities.  The  project  will \nimprove a city-wide bus-based public transport operating system, with improved and modern \nfranchising mechanisms that ensure supply meets demand. This will be supported through \ntraffic management improvements to prioritize bus services along a core network of around 110 \nkilometers (km). The core network will form part of an integrated and system wide operation with \nfeeder routes covering an additional 400 route-km, and associated passenger infrastructure and \nbus terminal facilities. The improved franchising mechanism will promote performance based \ncontracts, integrated fare collection systems, and streamlined through service operations. The \nProject  includes  institutional  strengthening  to  support  the  development  and  operation  of  a \nmodern  transport  system  and  franchising  mechanisms,  as  well  as  a  social  development \nprogram to support transport operators in the transition to a modern transport systems. The \nProject  includes  public-private  financing  arrangements  for  bus  fleet  renewal.  The  project \npreparatory  TA  will  assist  in  the  preparation  of  the  loan,  capacity  development,  social \ndevelopment program, and fleet renewal program. \n \n3.  The project preparatory TA will also include the development of a substantial institutional \nstrengthening  component  to  support the  City Transport  and Traffic  Code  through  the  City \nTransport and Traffic Management Office (CTTMO) and City Transport and Traffic Management \nBoard. Support in public transport management, sustainable transport planning, and a training \nprogram will be developed for city officials working in the sector. Social development programs \nwill  also  be  prepared  to  assist  current  operators  with  the  transition  to  the  modern  public \ntransport system.  \n \n4.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement \n \n5.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 equivalent, of which $800,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe high priority project of the government is well aligned with strategic directions of ADB, as \nwell as those for the sector and, thus, suitable for TASF financing. Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010  as \namended from time to time).
