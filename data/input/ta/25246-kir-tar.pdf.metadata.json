In July 1991 the Government of the Republic of Kiribati requested\nBank technical assistance for the commercialization and privatization of selected\npublic enterprises. In response, a Fact-Finding Mission from the Bank's South\nPacific Regional Office visited Kiribati from 27 November to 6 December 1991 to\nreview the Government's proposal. The Mission reached an understanding with\nGovernment officials on the scope and terms of reference of the proposed TA.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 1992.\nII.\t BACKGROUND\nA.\t Government Policies for Commercialization and Privatization of Public\nEnterprises\n2. At the time Kiribati gained independence in 1979 a shortage of\nskills, capital and management experience in the private sector necessitated\nsubstantial public sector involvement in a broad range of economic activities.\nAs a result, the Government currently owns and operates most of the larger\nenterprises providing goods and services within the economy. These public sector\nenterprises operate in such areas as wholesale and retail trading, printing, food\nmanufacture, shipping, airways, fuel supply, ownership of residential housing,\npublic utilities, banking, insurance, hotel accommodation, telecommunications,\nfishing and seaweed harvesting. A total of 37 Government corporations, companies\nand authorities have been established for these purposes.\n3. Recognizing the constraints in terms of personnel policies, financial\ndiscipline, financial management and economic development that have resulted from\npublic sector ownership and management of many of these activities, the\nGovernment in 1989 adopted a policy framework that provides an emphasis on\nprivatization of selected Government-owned enterprises as a means of promoting\neconomic growth and development. Key features of this policy framework include:\n(i) the objective of divesting full or majority ownership of all\nGovernment-owned enterprises to the private sector; the policy\nframework, however, provides for exceptions to this approach on the\ngrounds of \"natural monopolies or strategic considerations\";\n(ii) recognition of the need for privatization of the management function\nwhere privatization of ownership is held to be inappropriate;\n(iii) availability of fiscal and other incentives where considered\nnecessary for investors to participate in privatization transactions;\nand\n(iv) constraints on further Government investment in activities that might\ncompete with private sector investment.\n4.\t To oversee the implementation of this policy framework, a Special\nCommittee on Privatization was established.\t Reflecting the high priority\nattached to the work of that Committee, its membership was set at a senior level", "2\nincluding two cabinet ministers and five department heads. Since the\nestablishment of the Special Committee, two Government corporations (Air Tungaru\nCo. and Kiribati Supply Co.) have been converted into limited liability companies\nas a preliminary step to their eventual privatization. In addition, two\nGovernment-owned companies (Telecom Kiribati Ltd. and Kiribati oil Company Ltd.)\nhave entered into private management arrangements, and around 25 percent of\nshares in Abamakoro Trading Company have been sold to private sector investors.\nB.\t Need for the Technical Assistance\n5. Despite these developments, the Government has made little real\nprogress toward achieving its commercialization and privatization objectives.\nAs a result, the economy retains a strong public sector character, and the\nunderlying objective of creating a more dynamic, private sector led investment\nenvironment remains as distant as it was in 1989. The reasons for this lack of\nsuccess are not completely clear. However the following factors may have been\nimportant contributors:\n(i) Kiribati does not have any form of capital market. Private sector\ninvestors have very limited means for assembling investment capital.\n(ii) Commercialization of public sector entities has not been systematic\nand has not been based on detailed and carefully developed\nstrategies. The Government's approach to privatization activities\nhas been based largely on the analysis and recommendations of two\nUnited States Agency for International Development-funded experts\nwho visited Kiribati in 1987 for two weeks. It is unlikely that,\nwithin such a limited time, these experts would have been able to\nproduce more than a broad outline approach to a privatization\nprogram.\n(iii) Reflecting (ii), detailed business plans for efficient and profitable\noperation were not produced for the public enterprises that were the\nsubject of the initial commercialization/privatization proposals.\n(iv) For the public sector enterprises that have been changed into limited\nliability companies, appropriate financial restructuring in terms\nof their loan and equity mixes has not been undertaken. The\nfinancial status of the companies remains uncertain, which has been\nunderscored by apparent delays in the production of up-to-date\naudited accounts.\n(v) No significant attempt has been made to reorganize public sector\nprocurement practices. This has been particularly important because\nof the relatively high proportion of both capital and recurrent\nexpenditures (including procurement for the private sector) that has\nbeen made through Kiribati Supply Co. Ltd.\n(vi) There is a shortage of experience and appropriate expertise within\nkey Government departments for the development and implementation\nof commercialization/privatization procedures.", "3\n6. Commercialization and privatization of public enterprises may be\nundertaken in two stages. Stage one will be undertaken by a team of consultants\nprovided by a consulting firm with a strong track record in commercialization/\nprivatization activities. The firm will field a team of experts to develop fully\na detailed strategy for commercialization/privatization of selected public\nenterprises. This strategy will have the aim of substantially meeting the\nGovernment's objectives in this regard for the period until 31 December 1994.\nIncluded in the strategy will be specific proposals for the reorganization,\ndevelopment and divestment of the selected public sector activities and\nenterprises. The public sector enterprises included for commercialization/\nprivatization under the TA have been selected based on discussions between the\nGovernment and the Bank. The enterprises selected are listed in Appendix 1.\nThese enterprises have total assets among them of A$25 million.\n7. Stage two would entail the implementation of the strategy and\nproposals developed from stage one. The particular expertise inputs required\nfor this implementation process would be identified as part of the stage one\nexercise. The Government has been advised that, wherever practicable, the costs\nof that expertise should be carried as an operating expense by the various\ncommercial entities that would be the subject of the commercialization/\nprivatization process.\n8. This TA is for the implementation of stage one only.\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n9. The main objectives of the TA are to:\n(i) review the operations of the companies/enterprises listed in Appendix\n1 and identify a division of the activities currently undertaken by\nthese companies/ enterprises that would best promote the development\nof an efficient, progressive private business sector within the\ncountry; included in this review will be a full review of public\nsector procurement practices and a full review of the Government's\ninvolvement in the development and ownership of residential real\nestate;\n(ii) develop detailed strategies for the companies/enterprises listed in\nAppendix 1 that will facilitate their reorganization and operation\nas profitable, viable, self-sustaining entities capable of meeting\nstated objectives in terms of the Government's social and economic\nobjectives; these strategies should take full account of the findings\nfrom i) above;\n(iii) develop detailed business plans for each of the companies/ enterprises\nfor the period until 31 December 1994 including financial plans,\nbusiness and market development plans and staffing plans;", "4\n(iv) develop strategies, where practicable, for the eventual privatization\nof the companies/enterprises listed in Appendix 1 that will enable\ntheir disposition in an orderly and profitable manner by sale of\nshares or sale of assets; and\n(v) develop a detailed plan of action for implementing the strategies\nand plans developed in (ii) to (iv) above.\nB.\t Scope\n10. The TA will investigate the activities of the companies/enterprises\nlisted in Appendix 1. The consultants' tasks will commence with a review of the\nwork undertaken to date by the Government towards the commercialization/\nprivatization of public enterprises and identification of the major problems\nencountered in that process. The consultants will then review all aspects of\nthe operation of the companies listed in Appendix 1 including public sector\nprocurement practices and the current policies for the Government's involvement\nin and management of residential real estate. From the review, specific\nstrategies for the commercialization/privatization of all activities will be\ndeveloped. The consultants' will submit (i) detailed business plans for the\ncommercialization/privatization of all the companies/enterprises listed in\nAppendix 1, and (ii) detailed action plans for implementing these business plans.\nIncluded in each action plan will be recommendations for recruitment of all\nnecessary expertise for implementation of the action plan including terms of\nreference for personnel considered necessary for monitoring implementation.\nWhether and to what extent these personnel could be paid for under a TA (from\nthe Bank or elsewhere) will be discussed and agreed upon between the Bank and\nthe Government at a tripartite meeting following completion of the assignment.\nThe detailed terms of reference for the consultancy services are given in\nAppendix 2.\nC.\t Manpower Requirements\n11. The consulting assignment will be undertaken by a firm with strong\nand appropriate experience in the commercialization or corporatization of public\nsector enterprises and in the privatization of such enterprises. The assignment\nis expected to require a total of 24 man-months of consulting services and will\nbe undertaken over a nine-month period. The team fielded by the firm will\ninclude individuals with a wide range of expertise including (but not necessarily\nrestricted to) privatization, corporate finance, corporate law, marketing,\ndrafting of related legislation, hotel operation, airline management, public\nsector procurement practices, transactions in and management of residential real\nestate, wholesale and retail trading, personnel recruitment and management and\ninvestment banking. A team leader appointed by the firm will be present in the\nfield throughout the duration of the assignment. The firm will be recruited and\nengaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nD.\t Reporting Requirements\n12. The team leader will be accountable, through the Secretary of Finance\nand Economic Planning, to the Special Committee on Privatization. Within one\nmonth of commencing fieldwork, the team leader will present an inception report\nto the Secretary of Finance and Economic Planning describing a proposed work plan", "5\nfor the assignment. Documentary submissions made by the consultants during the\nterm of the assignment will be restricted to those working papers necessary for\ndecision-making by the members of the Special Committee and the controlling\nauthorities of the various companies/enterprises, the various enterprise-\nspecific strategies and business plans, and the action plan for implementation\nof the recommendations and findings of the assignment. At the completion of the\nassignment, the team leader will participate in a tripartite meeting with the\nGovernment and the Bank to review the manner in which the assignment was\nundertaken, the likely result and the future TA requirements for implementing\nthe consultants' recommendations.\nE.\t Cost Estimates and Proposed Financing Arrangement\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$613,000, of which\nUS$569,000 will be in foreign exchange and US$44,000 equivalent in local currency\n(see Appendix 3). It is proposed that the Bank finance the entire foreign\nexchange cost and US$20,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, totalling\nUS$589,000. The TA will be charged to the Bank-funded TA program. The\nGovernment will provide the equivalent of US$24,000 in local currency to cover\nthe costs of counterpart staff, secretarial services, office accommodation and\noffice supplies.\nF.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Finance and Economic\nPlanning.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n15.
