During  the  Country  Programming  Mission  in  2002,  the  Government  of  Pakistan \nrequested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to undertake \ninstitutional capacity building of the National Transmission and Despatch Company Limited \n(NTDC). A fact-finding mission visited Pakistan in February 2003 to formulate the TA and \nreached an understanding with the Government on the implementation arrangements, cost \nestimates, and terms of reference of consultants.1 The TA framework appears in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The power sector in Pakistan accounts for about 3.0% of its gross domestic product \n(GDP). However, in the last few years the financial position of the power sector has required \ndirect and indirect cash contribution from the Government. Currently, it is estimated that the \ncash requirements of the power sector for FY2003 will amount to a negative impact on GDP of \nabout 1.3%.There are a number of reasons for the current financial position of the power sector, \nsuch as (i) nonpayment of electricity provided by the Water and Power Development Authority \n(WAPDA)  and  Karachi  Electricity  Supply  Company  (KESC)  to  local  governments  and \ngovernment institutions and agencies; (ii) large technical and nontechnical inefficiencies at the \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution levels of the power sector; (iii) over-leveraging of the \nutilities\u2019  financial  capacity  to  meet  their  operating  costs;  (iv)  lack  of  funds  for  required \ninvestments; and (v) downturn in the international market for acquisitions of power sector \nassets. The Government is determined to change this situation, and various measures are in \nthe process of being implemented. \n \n3.  In April 1998 the Government approved a new power sector policy. This policy set out to \ncreate a more market-oriented power sector that would utilize private sector initiatives and \nfunding, on a competitive basis, to meet the demand for power and enhance the sector\u2019s \nefficiency. It was decided that KESC would be privatized and that WAPDA would be separated \ninto corporate entities responsible for thermal and hydro power generation, transmission and \ndispatch, and distribution. The Government has since then incorporated twelve new companies: \n3 generation companies, 1 transmission and dispatch company, and 8 distribution companies. \nThese corporate entities are under the purview of the National Electric Power Regulatory \nAuthority (NEPRA).  \n \n4.  ADB supports the Government\u2019s decision to reform the power sector. Subsequent to the \npolicy decisions taken in 1998. ADB approved an energy sector restructuring program2 to further \nsupport and fund the adjustment costs related to the power sector restructuring. In addition to \nsupporting the  reforms and restructuring, ADB also recognized that there was a need to \nundertake  specific  institutional  capacity  building  of  the  entities  directly  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of the new power sector. Accordingly, TA for institutional capacity building of \nNEPRA was approved and implemented during 2001 and 2002.3  \n \n5.  During the early part of implementing the energy restructuring program and under the \nimplementation of the NEPRA TA, it became evident that NTDC, which had been envisaged to \nbe the entity responsible for the transmission and dispatch functions of the nationwide electricity \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 18 February 2003. \n2  ADB. 2000.

Manila.. \n ", "2  \ngrid, would also be responsible for the power purchase and sales function, and would need \ncapacity building to fulfill those roles. Although ADB\u2019s experience suggests that it would have \nbeen preferable to split the transmission/dispatch from the single buyer/seller functions, the \nGovernment decided to pursue a more integrated approach. This integrated approach calls for \neven further institutional strengthening and understanding of the risks associated with the \nindividual  business  functions,  and  also  the  increased  risks  resulting  from  the  integrated \napproach. \n \n6.  National transmission and Despatch Company Limited (NTDC) was incorporated on 6 \nNovember 1998 and commenced commercial operation on 1 March 1999. It was organized to \ntake over all the properties, rights, assets, obligations and liabilities of 220 KV and 500 KV grid \nstation and transmission lines/network owned by Water and Power Development Authority \n(WAPDA). NTDC was granted Transmission License No. TL/01/2002 on 31 December 2002 bt \nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) to engage in the exclusive transmission \nbusiness for a term of 30 years, pursuant to Section 17 of the Regulation of Generation, \nTransmission and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997. This 30-year license calls for NTDC \nto undertake three specific functions, which are (i) the transmission operations of the high \nvoltage (200 kilovolts [kV] and above) power network, normally referred to as the wire business; \n(ii)  the  dispatch  of  all  power  generation  linked  to  the  national  grid;  and  (iii)  the  single \npurchaser/seller of power. The license calls for the establishment and implementation of a \nnumber of functions/tasks by specifically stated deadlines. In order to meet the deadlines, and \nnot be in breach of its licensing conditions, NTDC requires significant assistance in terms of \nskills and related resources. The major functions mentioned in the license are the establishment \nand implementation of the single buyer model by 1 July 2004, and the competitive market \noperations established and operational by 1 July 2009. \n \n7.  Although the power trading activities are major undertakings for NTDC, there has to be \nincreased focus on the wire business in terms of the design and planning function, as well as \nthe subsequent expansions.  NTDC, which has been assigned the wire functions of WAPDA, \nwill need to reassess the transmission network with the view to meeting the requirements of a \ncompetitive power trading market. These considerations are similar in the case of the dispatch \nfunction.  The focus of NTDC in terms of dispatch will gradually change from the current \nintegrated utility operations to the single buyer model, to evolve into a competitive economic \ndispatch model. \n \n8.  In order to ensure and improve governance in the power sector, it is necessary to \nundertake a comprehensive educational and training program in conjunction with the role and \nfunctions  of  NTDC  as  per  its  license.  There  need  to  be  specific  training  modules  for \nmanagement and staff of NTDC, and also for the various stakeholders such as representatives \nfrom the government ministries and agencies, power generators and distributors, the media, \nand consumer protection agencies and institutions. It is of the utmost importance that the new \npower trading system obtains the trust and confidence of the participants, and this objective can \nonly be met successfully by implementing a comprehensive program of education and training. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to undertake institutional capacity building of NTDC with the \nobjective of preparing it to professionally manage the power transmission, dispatch, and trading \nactivities stipulated by its license. This institutional capacity building will develop and implement ", "  3\nmore efficient and effective operating procedures for the system operations and the market \noperations of NTDC, resulting in a more transparent power sector. The output of the TA will be \nits contribution to increasing energy sector efficiency, energy sector investments, private sector \nparticipation, and to ensuring that energy supply is extended to remote areas in a sustainable \nmanner.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented by deploying a team of consultants to work on a long-term \nbasis together with the management and staff of NTDC. The consultants will assist NTDC to \nprepare and implement a number of tasks, in accordance with the license, in the areas of (i) \npower sector trading activities, (ii) financial and accounting systems and procedures, (iii) legal \nmatters,  (iv)  transmission  and  dispatch  systems  and  planning,  (v)  information  technology \nsolutions, and (iv) training. In addition to preparing NTDC to meet the requirements stated in the \nlicense of introducing a single buyer model for the power sector by 1 July 2004, the consultants \nwill  also  commence  preparatory  activities  for  the  introduction  of  the  competitive  market \noperations, scheduled to become operational by 1 July 2009. The TA will establish a clear \ndelineation between the various business functions of NTDC, and create systems ensuring that \nnone of NTDC\u2019s separate businesses either give or receive a subsidy from any other business \nsegment of NTDC.  \n \n11.  The TA will identify barriers to both the single buyer power sector trading system and the \ncompetitive power market model, and recommend measures to help achieve a sustainable \npower sector market from the single buyer model to the competitive market model through well-\ndefined  sequential  steps  over  the  next  7  years.  The  introduction  of  power  sector  trading \nactivities cannot be implemented without first prioritizing required investments for the market \noperations of NTDC as well as the transmission and dispatch systems. The TA requires the \nconsultants together with NTDC to develop the investment requirements over the 7-year period \nand ensure that the tariff filing procedures on NTDC with NEPRA clearly caters for the inclusion \nof investment requirements. A short, medium, and long-term investment strategy for meeting the \nrequirements of the license will be formulated in accordance with the demand and supply \nprojections available. The TA has been equally divided in its approach of developing the power \ntrading activities and ensuring that NTDC maintains its focus also on the transmission and \ndispatch functions in terms of enhanced planning and design functions. There is a need for \nNTDC to plan for and design its dispatch systems for economic based dispatch, which does \nchange the parameters of the transmission line utilization. \n \n12.  The training component of the TA will develop an integrated training program for all \nstakeholders  in  the  power  sector.  There  is  a  need  to  ensure  both  transparency  and \naccountability in the power trading activities, and equally essential that management and staff of \nNTDC, power generators, power distribution companies, bulk purchasers, the media, and the \npublic clearly understand and are aware of the power trading system and its various functions. \nThe  consultants  will  develop  training  modules  addressing  these  issues  for  each  of  the \nstakeholder groups. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising about $460,000 \nin foreign exchange and about $290,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The cost estimates \n ", "4  \nare  presented  in  Appendix  2.  ADB will provide $600,000, comprising $460,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $140,000 equivalent of local currency cost. The TA will be funded on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. It is recognized that \nthe  TA  has  a  rather  ambitious  timetable  as  well  as  number  of  tasks  to  be  completed. \nAccordingly, ADB is pursuing possible cofinancing opportunities in order to increase the number \nof person-months of international and domestic consultants allocated to the TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Water and Power will be the Executing Agency of the TA. NTDC will be \nthe Implementing Agency in close cooperation with Pakistan Electric Power Company Ltd., and \nNTDC will assign at least four counterpart staff to work closely with the consultants. One of the \nNTDC counterpart staff members will serve as project director, and as such will be responsible \nfor coordination between the consultants, the Implementing Agency, and the Executing Agency.  \n \n15.  The TA is expected to commence in September 2003, and be carried out over 15 \nmonths  by  an  internationally  recognized  consulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants, with completion by December 2004. The total input of international and domestic \nconsultant services will be about 16 and 32.5 person-months, respectively. The consultants will \nbe  expected  to  have  demonstrated  experience  in  overall  power  sector  trading  activities; \ntransmission  and  dispatch  system  planning,  development,  and  operation;  and  related \ninformation technology system design, software, and hardware solutions. The outline terms of \nreference for the consulting services is presented in Appendix 3. ADB will use simplified \ntechnical proposals and quality- and cost-based selection methods for consultant selection. \nConsultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n16.  The  Government,  through  NTDC,  has  agreed  to  fund  additional  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants to ensure further in-depth work being undertaken in each of the areas \ncovered by the TA, and in particular in the areas of computer programming and information \ntechnology system design and implementation. It is clearly understood by all parties that  these \nconsultants are the same domestic consultants hired by ADB, and under the consultant contract \nbetween  ADB  and  the  consultants.  The  Government\u2019s  obligations  will  be  recorded  in  the \nverification of counterpart funds and facilities. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for Institutional Capacity Building of the National Transmission and \nDespatch Company Limited, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
