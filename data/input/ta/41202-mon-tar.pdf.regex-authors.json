The  Government  of  Mongolia  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \ntechnical assistance (TA) for capital markets development. The Fact-Finding Mission visited \nUlaanbaatar during 25\u201329 February 2008.1 Following the discussions, an understanding was \nreached on the objectives, scope, and implementation arrangement of the TA.2 The recent \ndevelopment of the nonbank financial sector, including capital markets in Mongolia and the \nsuccessful establishment of the Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC) in particular, have \nbeen significantly supported by previous and current ADB-funded TA projects and program \nloans.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  An efficiently functioning financial sector is key to achieving a market-based economy for \npromoting rapid economic development with the private sector as the engine of growth. The \nMongolian financial system has been growing rapidly but remains dominated by commercial \nbanks, which hold more than 90% of the financial sector assets, and is underdeveloped in other \naspects.  \n \n3.  While the banking sector has stabilized and strengthened since the banking crises of the \n1990s and the Government has started to build the basic foundation for the nonbank financial \nsector,  the  financial  sector\u2019s  role  in  promoting  economic  growth  is  still  limited.  Although \nimproving in recent years, the nonbank financial sector\u2014including capital markets\u2014has been \nhampered by weaknesses in the legal, regulatory, supervisory, and governance framework, and \nlow investor confidence. Nonbank financial institutions remain small and account for only 3.7% \nof total financial sector assets (August 2007). \n \n4.  The FRC\u2014the consolidated nonbank financial markets regulator\u2014was established in \nearly 2006 with significant support from ADB under the ongoing loan.3 The FRC has undertaken \nseveral initiatives to improve the legal, regulatory, and supervisory environment of the nonbank \nfinancial  sector,  but  is  severely  constrained  by  limited  resources  in  terms  of  physical \ninfrastructure,  management  and  staff  capacity,  and  knowledge. 4  In  particular,  adequate \ninformation technology management information systems (ITMIS) need to be established and \nmaintained in order to improve the quality of supervision, better manage financial sector risks, \nand more generally enable the FRC to meet its mandate of promoting financial sector stability \nand development. Limited financial resources are provided by the government budget, thus \nthere is considerable need for development partner assistance for capacity and institutional \ndevelopment. Increasing the FRC\u2019s independence as a regulatory body by making it partly or \nwholly funded by a levy on the firms it regulates\u2014and thus less dependent on the government \nbudget\u2014has clear advantages. \n \n                                                 \n1  The Mission met with senior officers from the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Mongolia, Financial Regulatory \nCommission (FRC), Mongolian Bankers Association, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 June 2008. \n3  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Financial Regulation and Governance Program. Manila (Loan \n2218-MON[SF]). \n4  In addition to establishing its own internal management and procedures and integrating staff from different \norganizations with different corporate cultures, the FRC has made important efforts in drafting laws and regulations \n(for instance, the Law on Cooperatives, the Securities Market Law, and insurance regulations), licensing saving \nand credit cooperatives, and inspecting listed companies in cooperation with the Mongolian Stock Exchange. ", "2   \n5.  The  Mongolian  Stock  Exchange  (MSE)  was  launched  in  February  1992  to  help \nimplement  the  Government\u2019s  privatization  program.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  was  instrumental  in \nproviding policy and technical advice, and in financing basic computer equipment early on. \nHowever, the MSE has still not genuinely transformed from a venue for state-owned enterprise \nprivatization to a modern stock exchange where private companies and financial institutions can \nraise long-term capital. Stock market capitalization has grown and trading activity started to \nrevive in 2007 after a long decline since the late 1990s. However, a few stocks account for \nnearly all of the market capitalization and active trading and, since 2005, there have been only \neight initial public offerings. Private companies and financial institutions currently use the MSE \nonly to a very limited extent to raise new capital. Mongolian banks are so far not participating in \ncapital market activities to the same extent as in many other countries, and there is virtually no \nsecondary market for government and corporate bonds as nearly all bonds are bought by banks \nand held to maturity. There are no institutional investors operating in Mongolia which could \ninvest in the securities markets, and there is no local rating agency. The MSE is planning to \nimplement  a  $5  million  project  supported  by  the  Korean  Stock  Exchange  to  improve  the \ninformation technology infrastructure for trading systems and build capacity. \n \n6.  To meet the International Organization of Securities Commissions principles of securities \nregulation, the MSE needs to improve its trading rules and create an effective surveillance \nsystem for trading activities in order to monitor unusual price or volume movements and detect \npossible insider trading, manipulation, or other improper trading activity. In 2003, the MSE\u2019s \nfunctions were divided, with the MSE made responsible for securities trading, and a separate \nstate-owned limited liability company (the Securities Clearing House and Central Depository \n[SCHCD]) given responsibility for securities clearing, settlement, and depository functions.  \n \n7.  Improved  governance  and  implementation  of  international  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards in the corporate sector are necessary to increase public confidence in the operations \nof the nonbank financial and capital market sectors, and thus are essential preconditions for the \nsuccessful development of domestic capital markets. In particular, listed companies need to \nprepare  their  financial  statements  accurately  and  on  time,  with  full  accountability  and \ntransparency, and have them published regularly. Assisting the FRC and the Bank of Mongolia \n(BOM) in corporate governance issues was a major input of the Capacity Building for Financial \nSector Reforms TA5 and resulted in, among other things, the adoption by the FRC of the new \nNational Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies on 28 December 2007.  \n \n8.  Insufficient development of the financial sector is a key constraint to stable and broad-\nbased economic growth in Mongolia.6 ADB has actively supported Mongolia\u2019s capital markets \n                                                 \n5  TA 4737-MON is attached to ADB. 2005.

", "  3\nthrough a number of financial sector program loans as well as TA projects.7 Key achievements \nof  previous  and  ongoing  ADB  loans  and  TA  projects  for  financial  sector  reform  include \nrestructuring  and  privatization  of  state-owned  banks,  development  of  an  interbank  market, \nfurther strengthening of banking legislation and regulations, and, in particular, development of a \nbasic  framework  and  infrastructure  for  the  nonbank  financial  sector.  Building  on  progress \nachieved  under  previous  program  loans,  the  currently  implemented  loan  (footnote  3)  and \nattached TA (footnote 5), use a comprehensive approach in addressing the remaining legal, \nregulatory, institutional, and policy weaknesses, focusing on the nonbank financial sector. \n  \n9.  Developing a well-functioning and broad-based financial system is a gradual process, \nespecially in transition economies with limited market-based institutions and human resources, \nand the Government of Mongolia has requested ADB for continued support for capital markets \ndevelopment. The recently concluded Financial Sector Assessment Program8 delivered by the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank9 highlights the legal framework, financial \ninfrastructure, accounting and auditing standards, and corporate governance as areas in need \nof particular strengthening. While a coherent and comprehensive financial sector development \nstrategy  which  facilitates  implementation,  sequencing,  and  prioritization  of  various  reform \nmeasures is currently not in place in Mongolia, the FRC has recently prepared and approved \nthe Program for Development of the Capital Markets in Mongolia for 2008\u20132011. The program, \nwhich will be further developed and strengthened through dialogue and support from ADB, calls \nfor an increased role of the capital markets through strengthening the legal and regulatory \nenvironment, investing in market and supervisory infrastructure, and adopting international best \npractices  in  all  related  areas  to  improve  transparency,  efficiency,  competitiveness,  and \nprotection of investors\u2019 rights. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is the establishment of more efficient, transparent, and robust \ncapital markets. \n \n11.  The  expected  outcome  is  a  deepening  of  capital  market  reforms  through  improved \nsupervisory  capacity,  an  improved  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  strengthened  securities \nmarkets, and increased investor confidence.  \n \n \n                                                 \n7  Strengthening the Supervisory and Restructuring Capacity of the Bank of Mongolia (TA 2720-MON, for $1 million) \nand Upgrading Skills and Systems of Commercial Banks (Loan 1510-MON[SF], for $3 million) are attached to \nADB. 1996.

Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will contribute to (i) an improved regulatory and supervisory capacity of the FRC, \n(ii) development of capital markets, and (iii) increased efficiency of the stock market. \n \n1.  Improved Regulatory and Supervisory Capacity of the Financial Regulatory \nCommission \n13.  In order to improve sustainability as well as the regulatory and supervisory capacity of \nthe FRC, the following areas for support by the TA have been identified as priorities: \n(i)  Financial sustainability. Preparation of a policy paper for major governmental \nstakeholders and high-level decision makers on recommendations (based on \ninternational best practices) of options for the FRC to become less dependent on \nthe government budget by being partly or wholly funded by a levy on the firms it \nregulates.  \n(ii)  Information  technology  development.  Assist  in  the  implementation  of  the \nITMIS recommendations of TA (footnote 5) in terms of hardware investment, \nsoftware development, and training. \n(iii)  Training.  Preparation of training modules for selected areas covered by the \nFRC, as well as for investor education programs.   \n(iv)  Capacity building. Short-term assignments as requested by the FRC.    \n \n2.  Development of Capital Markets  \n14.  Development of capital markets is particularly important in the current period of strong \neconomic  growth  and  liquidity.  The  following  areas  of  support  for  strengthening  and \ndevelopment of the capital markets have been identified: \n(i)  Improved legal and regulatory framework. Development of implementation \nregulations for a revised Securities Market Law, and further streamlining of the \nlegal and regulatory frameworks for NBFIs. \n(ii)  Support for creation of institutional investors. Facilitation of the development \nand  operations  of  institutional  investors,  such  as  investment  funds  and  life \ninsurance companies. \n(iii)  Strengthened  corporate  bond  market. Assistance in the development of a \ncorporate bond market and its supporting infrastructure, such as credit rating \nagencies. \n \n3.  Increased Efficiency of the Stock Market  \n15.  The following areas of support for the stock market were identified: \n(i)  Privatization  of  the  MSE.  Development  of  options  for  privatizing  the  stock \nexchange aimed at strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of securities \nmarkets. \n(ii)  Improved trading rules and surveillance. Improvement of the MSE\u2019s trading \nrules in line with international standards, and support for the establishment of a \nreal-time surveillance system for the FRC\u2019s trade monitoring function to detect \nirregularities. \n(iii)  Improved  clearing  and  settlement.  Investigation  of  the  need  to  increase \nprocessing capacity and risk management capability of the SCHCD. ", "  5\n(iv)  Improved  corporate  governance  standards.  Enhanced  implementation  of \ncorporate  governance  guidelines  and  encouragement  of  listed  companies  to \nimprove their social responsibility by establishing a social responsibility index. \n \n16.  The TA will also identify lending and nonlending opportunities that could be supported by \nADB. These could include (i) certain components of the ITMIS for the FRC in line with the \nrecommendations of the TA (footnote 5); (ii) trading, payment, and settlement systems of the \nstock exchange and clearing company; and (iii) investment opportunities aimed at strengthening \nthe efficiency and competitiveness of securities exchanges. \n \n17.  The  main  risk  lies  in  significantly  delayed  introduction  of  new  legislation  and  legal \namendments and/or inadequate design due to the Parliament\u2019s likely crowded post-election \nagenda in 2008.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide the remaining $100,000 of local \ncurrency costs in-kind, to cover office accommodation, counterpart staff, transportation, and \nother related services. The TA will provide a combination of policy and technical advice.\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months, commencing in October 2008. \nThe TA will require 11 person-months of international consulting services and 14 person-months \nof  national  consulting  services.  The  international  consultants  include  a  capital  market \nsupervision and institutional investor specialist and a capital market financial infrastructure and \ninformation system specialist. Two national consultants with expertise in the above areas will be \ncontracted for about the same length of time. Considering that all four assignments will be small \nand  on  an  intermittent  basis,  hiring  using  the  individual  consultants  method  is  considered \nappropriate. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for the \nconsultants  are  outlined  in  Appendix  3.  The  equipment  budgeted  under  the  proposed  TA \nconsists of a strictly limited number of computers and other electronic equipment that will be \nprocured by ADB in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). The equipment will be transferred to the FRC upon completion of the TA.  \n \n20.  The team leader will coordinate the input of all other consultants. The consultants will \nsubmit (i) an inception report 3 weeks after start of services, (ii) an interim progress report 5 \nmonths after start of services, (iii) a draft final report 11 months after start of services, and (iv) a \nfinal TA report 2 weeks after receiving comments from the FRC (the executing agency) and \nADB. A taskforce will be formed comprising officials from Ministry of Finance, BOM, and FRC to \nserve as a coordination mechanism. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Capital Markets Development, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nMore efficient,  \u2022 Increased frequency of  \u2022 Economic reports and  \u2022 New Government is formed \ntransparent, and  initial public offerings  official statistics from  expeditiously following \nrobust capital markets  (eight by early 2008) and  BOM and IMF  Parliamentary elections \nestablished  issuance of shares by  Risks \n  end of 2010  \u2022 High dependence on a \n\u2022 Increased issuance of  narrow range of commodity \ncorporate bonds (12 by  exports of the Mongolian \nearly 2008) by end of  economy creates a boom-\n2010  bust cycle (for example fall in \n  international commodity \nprices) \n\u2022 Overly expansionary fiscal \npolicy creates overheating, \nhigh inflation, overvalued \ncurrency and financial \ninstability \nOutcome      Assumption \nCapital markets  \u2022 Increased stock market  \u2022 Economic reports and  \u2022 New government remains \nreforms deepened  turnover from 40% of  official statistics from  committed to reforms in \nthrough improved  GDP in 2007 by end of  BOM, FRC, MSE, and  financial sector \nsupervisory capacity,  2010  MOF  Risk \nlegal and regulatory  \u2022 Increased fixed income  \u2022 Introduction of new legislation \nframework,  market turnover (17% of  and legal amendments for \nstrengthened  GDP in 2006),  NBFI and capital markets \nsecurities markets,  particularly corporate  significantly delayed due to \nand increased  bonds (3% of GDP in  Parliament\u2019s likely crowded \ninvestor confidence   2006) by end of 2010  post-election agenda and/or \n    the Government not fully \nmeeting program objectives. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
