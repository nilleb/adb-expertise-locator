INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Bhutan  has requested the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve the competitiveness of the high-value agriculture and \nartisan  products  business  subsector  and  its  support  services  to  achieve  a  higher  level  of \ncompetitiveness in domestic and export markets. ADB fielded consultation missions with the \ngovernment  and  private  sector  and  agreed  with  the  government  on  the  design  and \nimplementation arrangements.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Given the vulnerabilities that arise from a narrow export base and market, a major \nchallenge for Bhutan is to diversify its export markets. The Government of Bhutan\u2019s 11th Five \nYear  Plan3 aims  to  expand  into  new  markets,  achieve  inclusive  social  development,  and \naccelerate green economic development through the Rural Economy Advancement Program \nand the Rapid Investment in Selected Enterprises Program. These two programs form the \ncornerstone of the government\u2019s diversification strategy, which aims to develop agro-processing \nand other subsectors, small and cottage industries, and tourism links. Bhutan\u2019s trade strategy \nhighlights  high-value  niche  exports  that  promote  Brand  Bhutan  and  indicate  the  product\u2019s \ngeographic  origin. 4  Bhutan\u2019s  forestry  policy  also  highlights  comparative  advantages  in \nnutraceuticals, medicinal herbs, and natural dyes, which compliment artisan and high-value \nagricultural products. The One Village One Product (OVOP) initiative supported by the Queen\u2019s \nProject Office (QPO) has prioritized a number of Bhutanese agro-products based on market \npotential, grassroots community production, and potential for development and scaling up. \n \n3.  Recent  lessons  from  agriculture  projects  in  Bhutan  show  that  more  entrepreneurial \ncapacity is required for value-adding agro-enterprises to compete successfully.5 In Bhutan, the \ninclusive approach to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) development has \nraised awareness but has spread capacity thinly.6 Further, the majority of MSME clusters are at \na basic stage of commercialization. To date, few interventions have given adequate commercial \nfocus to establish comprehensive and viable value chains with attention to village-based supply \nchain management, post-farm processing, marketable product development, packaging and \nlogistics, and value competitiveness in end markets. The OVOP approach has contributed to \nrural village sustainability in Japan and Thailand and was recently adopted in Bhutan. However, \nthe approach relied heavily on public sector resources to build start-up capacity building, which \n                                                \n1  The proposed TA is included in ADB. 2016.

Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2013\u20132018. \nThimphu. \n4  In October 2014, the Department of Trade, with support from the United Nations Development Programme and \nglobal brand partner FutureBrand, developed the Brand Bhutan strategy, which reflects the values of Bhutanese \nsociety, history and Gross National Happiness philosophy, and recognizes country of origin as a dimension of \nbrand strength in export markets.    \n5  World Bank. 2015.

FAST Report: Equity Investment to the Mountain Hazelnuts Group Limited for the \nHazelnut Value Chain Development Project in Bhutan. Manila. \n6  MSME clusters typically include (i) farmers, wild product collectors, artisans, and input suppliers; (ii) MSMEs \ninvolved in processing, grading, packing, and marketing; (iii) logistics and financial services; (iv) wholesale, retail, \nand food service markets; and (v) other enterprises, including for machinery parts and repairs, design, and \ntechnical advice.  \n ", "2 \ncontributed to the failure of an ADB project in Pakistan.7 Among emerging agro-enterprises and \ngovernment support services, there is limited understanding of MSME business structures, \nbusiness-to-business  linkages,  and  practices  for  commercially  attractive  value  adding  and \nmarketing that (i) builds in fair trading and ethical treatment of grassroots producers, (ii) meets \ninternational  quality  and  safety  standards,  and  (iii)  can  effectively  embody  Brand  Bhutan. \nLessons from an ADB brand marketing project in Mongolia8 and local stakeholders suggest that \nBrand Bhutan needs to be supported by formal eligibility criteria for products and services and \nintellectual property registration. Capacity building can help develop the brand in a competitive \nglobal context. The World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Surveys indicate that agribusiness in Bhutan is \nweak in innovation and has made limited use of information communication technology. Only \n3.7% of agro-enterprises in Bhutan have some form of certification, compared with 17.2% in the \nregion.9 \n \n4.  The  global  market  segment  for  natural,  certified  organic,  standardized  for  safety, \nsustainable,  and  socially  responsible  food,  fiber,  and  cosmetics  is  worth  about  $5  billion \nannually, has been growing 12% per year since 2009, and is forecast to reach about $6 billion in \n2016.10 Developed  countries  dominate  this  high-value  market  by  building  on  traditional \nknowledge and practices with modern farming and processing technologies, attention to quality, \nwell-researched product design, and tight value chain linkages. But Bhutan has comparative \nadvantages in many high-value niche products. Studies have identified a number of Himalayan \nfruits  and  honey  with  high  levels  of  bioactive  and  antioxidant  compounds11 that  food  and \nbeverage manufacturers are demanding as new food ingredients, together with \u201cancient grains\u201d \nproduced in Bhutan.12  \n \n5.  The critical constraints are (i) lack of knowledge on small-scale agro-processing and \nvalue adding; (ii) lack of laboratory analysis to quantify bioactive compounds and product quality; \n(iii) limited capacity of support services to help MSMEs meet high-value market standards; \n(iv) poor linkages between producers and buyers; (v) fragmentation resulting in insufficient scale, \ninefficient logistics, and a high proportion of transaction cost in the end market price due to \nmultiple middlemen in the value chain; and (vi) limited knowledge of financial performance, \nresulting in lack of finance. But for micro and small agro-enterprises and government support \nservices, market competitiveness is the key challenge. It encompasses the need to improve \npost-farm processing, packaging, labeling and product design, organization of transport and \nlogistics, and small-business skills such as supply chain and financial management. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact will be a broader and diversified economic and export base. The outcome \nwill  be  enhanced  competitiveness  of  prioritized  high-value  agriculture  and  artisan  MSME \nclusters  in  domestic  and  export  markets.  High-value  agriculture  and  artisan  clusters  will \ngraduate to a higher level of competitiveness, with increased value capture by local MSMEs. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010.

The TA focuses on the upstream value chain rather than on farming. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The TA will be implemented in two phases: (i) readiness and needs assessment, and \n(ii) capacity building. The TA will achieve the outcome through the following outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Business skills capacity of selected high-value agribusiness and \nartisan micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise clusters improved. The \nTA will support (a) the selection of a small number of existing enterprise clusters \nat strategic locations, which may include food, beverage, herbal cosmetics, and \nartisan products; based on business readiness, sustainability and inclusiveness, \npotential for scale and replicability, and competitive advantage; (b) the provision \nof business development services, including market research, to refine product \nattributes and packaging design, upgrade equipment, and determine costs and \npricing strategies; and (c) the provision of training and advisory services to boost \nentrepreneurship, business planning, and ability to access and manage finance. \n(ii)  Output 2: Production, value-adding, and marketing capacity of selected \nmicro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprise  clusters  upgraded.  For  the \nselected value-adding entities and their farmer suppliers, the TA will provide \n(a) training,  demonstration,  and  advisory  services  to  promote  commercial, \ncertified organic, and food safety systems; (b) training, demonstration, analytical, \nand  advisory  services  for  improved  value-adding  processes;  standardized \nproduct formulation; and operating procedures and documentation to meet food \nsafety and quality requirements; and (c) assistance to access matching grant \nsupport  for  capital  value-adding  items,  including  grading,  processing,  and \npackaging  equipment.  The  training  program  will  be  publicly  announced  to \nencourage the participation of women. \n(iii)  Output 3: Value chains, from production to end markets, strengthened. The \nTA  will  (a)  strengthen quality  assurance  and  intellectual  property  by  helping \ndevelop  and  register  logos,  brands,  trademarks,  ethical  trade  and  social \nresponsibility endorsement, organic certification, and geographic indication of \norigin where product and market opportunities have been identified; (b) support \nstakeholder forums and tools to improve communication, access to services, \nmarket promotion, coordination, logistics, and consolidation of value chains; and \n(c) foster supplier\u2013market linkages and agritourism linkages through approved \nsupplier schemes and participatory guarantee systems. \n \n8.  Regional economic crisis may have a negative impact on agribusiness, which can be \nmitigated by diversification and improved competitiveness. All small enterprises face risks that \nmay  result  in  financial  or  organizational  failure  as  they  grow,  which  will  be  mitigated  by \nconducting a risk and needs assessment and by applying selection criteria, including (i) start-up \nrisk: only existing enterprises with  at least 1 year of commercial operation with net profit; \n(ii) governance  risk:  enterprises  must  have  their  registration,  governance  structure,  annual \nreports, and accounts inspected and approved by the Department of Agriculture Marketing and \nCooperatives (DAMC) or another relevant authority; (iii) organizational risk: enterprises must \nhave persons identified for management, financial, and operational responsibilities, and have \nsystems for supply chain and marketing; (iv) financial risk: enterprise financial statements must \nbe approved by relevant authorities to ensure viability before selection; and (v) safeguards and \ninclusiveness: enterprises will be screened. \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  utilities, \nsecretarial assistance, taxes and duties, and other in-kind contributions. Detailed cost estimates \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  The QPO will be the executing agency and act as the implementing agency. A project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established and the QPO will appoint a project coordinator. The \nQPO will provide furnished office facilities with internet and utilities for the PMU, consultants, \nand support staff. A project steering committee will be established and will comprise members \nof the existing OVOP committee. The QPO will be responsible for (i) providing training to \nbeneficiaries to ensure the full cooperation of other government agencies, including the Ministry \nof Agriculture and Forests, to make their staff available; using the training programs of the \nNational Organic Program, DAMC, Post-Harvest Center, and Bhutan Agriculture and Food \nRegulatory Authority; (ii) coordinating with district and block-level staff; (iii) carrying out day-to-\nday TA activities, such as overseeing the consultants\u2019 work, conducting TA review workshops, \nand providing visas and domestic travel permits for international consultants; (iv) procuring \nvehicles, supplies, and equipment following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time); and (v) organizing and conducting the study tour within the Asian region. \n \n11.  The proposed study tour for 10 persons will expose participants to sustainable high-\nvalue food and related products, packaging, and markets in Asia through a regional expo, and \nprovide an opportunity to gain lessons learned from agencies and entities supporting similar \ndevelopment initiatives. The project coordinator will select study tour participants from MSME \nleaders, the QPO, and key government support agency staff. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, tentatively from January 2017 to December \n2019. The TA will require 7 person-months of international consultant inputs and 18 person-\nmonths of national consultant inputs. A consulting firm will be engaged using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method with a 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio (since the assignments are complex \nwith high downstream impacts) and a lump-sum contract will be offered. As these inputs need to \nbe provided in line with the needs of MSME clusters and public sector partners, the exact nature \nand  scheduling  of  the  consultants  cannot  be  predetermined.  The  firm  will  mobilize  the \nconsultants according to project needs, with the schedule determined during implementation to \nensure flexibility. The recruitment of consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  as  specified  in  the  Project \nAdministration Instructions on Preparing for Consultant Recruitment.13 \n \n13.  Consultant inputs will comprise (i) an agribusiness value-chain development specialist \nand team leader (international, 4.5 person-months), (ii) an enterprise capacity building specialist \nand deputy team leader (national, 12 person-months), (iii) a marketing specialist (international, \n1.5 person-months), (iv) a market linkages and communications specialist (national, 2 person-\nmonths), (v) product formulation specialists (international, 1 person-month; national 2 person-\n                                                \n13  ADB. 2014.

The terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  The firm will also be responsible for hiring domestic and international contracted services \nfor  activities  such  as  sample  assessments,  certification,  periodic  logistical  and  operational \nsupport, design of prototypes, food technology formulations, business accountancy services, \nand information and communications technology services. The nature and schedule of work will \nbe confirmed after MSME clusters are prioritized and their development needs are assessed. \n \n15.  Good  practices  and  lessons  learned  will  be  documented  and  disseminated through \n(i) the  training  of  MSMEs  and  service  providers;  (ii)  a  national  workshop;  (iii)  value  chain \nstakeholder forums; and (iv) the publication of outputs through the OVOP website, as applicable. \n \n16.  The  QPO,  through  the  PMU,  will  be  responsible  for  the  procurement  of  vehicles, \nsupplies, and equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time). The Government of Bhutan will be responsible for all taxes and duties related \nto all project expenditures. The QPO has a shortage of vehicles, particularly utility vehicles for \ncarrying equipment, sample packaging, and products, and transporting personnel. Four-wheel-\ndrive vehicles are required to regularly access remote rural areas. To minimize costs and \npotential for misuse, vehicles will be basic models preferably of regional make and will be turned \nover to the QPO upon completion of the TA project. \n \n17.  The PMU will procure equipment, according to the needs assessment of MSME clusters \nand government support services, in the early stages of TA implementation. The equipment will \nbe used for post-harvest and processing facilities, laboratory facilities, and training that will be \nconducted in coordination with programs run by support service agencies, including the DAMC, \nPost-Harvest Center, Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority, and National Organic \nProgram. It will be turned over to the QPO upon physical completion of the TA. \n \n18.  The consulting firm will be responsible for (i) the procurement of contracted services; \n(ii) surveys and market research; and (iii) administration and miscellaneous support, including \nproject management, reports, and domestic transport, following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Bhutan  for  Enhancing  Competitiveness  of  High-Value  Agriculture  and \nArtisan Products Value Chains, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nEconomic and export base broadened and diversifieda \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019:     \nCompetitiveness of  About 50 MSMEs have  Market surveys of  Regional or global \nprioritized HVA and  demonstrated improved  selected MSMEs  economic crisis affects \nartisan MSME  domestic market share  small businesses \nclusters in domestic  and export performance \nand export markets  (2016 baseline: 0) \nenhanced \nOutputs  By 2019:     \n1.
