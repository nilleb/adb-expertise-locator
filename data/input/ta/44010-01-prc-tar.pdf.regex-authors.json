INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission in December 2009, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) for capacity development for railway track maintenance. A fact-finding \nmission visited the PRC in October 2010 and reached agreement with the government on the \nTA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, \nand  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. The TA is in the ADB\u2019s technical assistance program for the PRC for 2010.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Given the PRC\u2019s large land area and population, railways play a vital role in transport. \nThey are an accessible, environment-friendly, less-land demanding, energy-efficient, and low \ncost mass transport mode for people and goods. By providing efficient transport and opening up \nless-accessible regions, railways have helped to expand economic opportunities and spread \nthese to poorer provinces, and have thereby contributed to growth of employment and incomes, \nand to poverty reduction. \n \n3.  For  the  last  10\u201315  years,  the  government  has  been  prioritizing  railway  network \nexpansion and optimization to support rapid economic development. By the end of 2009, the \nrailway network was 86,000 kilometers (km) in length. This represented a 37.8% increase since \n1995, including 6,300 km of new high-speed railways. Over this period, passenger traffic (in \npassenger-km) increased by 222% and freight (in ton-km) by 193%. In spite of this track \nexpansion,  the  PRC  railways  remain  the  busiest  in  the  world.  Traffic  density  reached \n45.58 million ton-km/km in 2007.2 Railway transport is still unable to meet the rising demand for \npassenger  and  freight  transportation  resulting  from  the  PRC\u2019s  high  economic  growth  and \nurbanization. The government therefore intends to construct 16,000 km of high-speed railways \nby 2016 and expand the railway network to over 120,000 km by 2020.  \n \n4.  Efficient track maintenance is essential for the competitiveness, condition, reliability, and \nsafety of the railway. In a well-maintained rail network (i) the track system3 will enable trains to \nmove fast, rolling stock to need less maintenance, and accident risks to be minimized, (ii) the \nperiods when train operations are stopped for track maintenance are minimized, therefore \nallowing higher track usage; and (iii) the cost of necessary maintenance are lower. \n \n5.  The  rapid  development  of  the  PRC  railways  has  brought  new  challenges  for  track \nmaintenance capacity. The quantity of maintenance to be undertaken has grown quickly due to \nnetwork expansion and increased track usage. Between 2000 and 2009, double-track railways \nincreased by 57.2% in length to reach 33,000 km in 2009, and electrified lines increased by \n142.3% to reach 36,000 km. Twenty-six railway lines with a total length of 9,200 km are \ncurrently under construction, and 70 new railway projects are under review. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA was included in the technical assistance program, 2010 as shown in the BTOR of the country programming \nmidterm review mission dated 18 June 2010. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 25 November 2010. \n2  Assuming one passenger-km equals one ton-km. \n3  The rails, switches, guard rails, rail slices, ballast bed or monolithic track bed, sleepers and fastenings, and track \nsubsidiary facilities. \n ", "2  \n6.  Track maintenance on high speed railway lines poses a new challenge. More than \n7,000 km of high speed railways were put in operation in the past 3 years.4 Another 6,000 km \nwill be added in the next 3 years. High-speed railways require far more stringent operating \nstandards than normal lines due to the higher operating speeds. As a result, their maintenance \nneeds are heavily mechanized, using the latest technologies. Many of the newly constructed \nrailways are located in less-developed and poor areas, with difficult terrains such as mountains \nor  complex  geological  areas  (e.g.,  permafrost,  collapsed  loess,  seismic  belt,  soft  soil  and \nunderground mined-out areas). Track maintenance in those areas is more complex, requiring \nmore specialized and technically qualified staff. \n \n7.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR) has been gradually developing its track maintenance \ncapacity. Track maintenance development was included in MOR\u2019s 10th and 11th Five-Year \nPlans  and  in  the  Railway  Mid-term  and  Long-term  Development  Program  for  2020.  Key \nelements include: (i) adapting from a mostly manual, labor-intensive approach to predominantly \nmechanized maintenance in order to upgrade quality and efficiency (the normal practice of \nindustrialized countries); (ii) restructuring the organization of track maintenance to improve its \nmanagement and adjust to the new maintenance methods; (iii) establishing a track maintenance \nmanagement  information  system  in  MOR;  and  (iv) developing  staff  capacity  to  use  new \nmechanized maintenance processes.  \n \n8.  With ADB support, MOR has made significant investments to modernize its maintenance \nequipment and practices. It has procured about 1,350 sets of advanced and efficient large track \nmaintenance machines (LTMMs), mainly in the last few years, at a cost of about CNY20 billion \n($2.86 billion). In its past railway projects, ADB financed the purchase of 99 sets of advanced \nLTMMs (ADB financing of $140 million). The ongoing Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an Railway Project5 will \nfinance another $60 million for LTMMs. In the coming 5 years, MOR plans to spend a further \nCNY14 billion ($2.1 billion) on LTMMs. \n \n9.  MOR  has  also  been  restructuring  its  railway  track  maintenance  organization.  To \nstrengthen the specialized management and operation of mechanized maintenance work, in \n1990\u20132000 MOR set up a permanent way depot responsible for mechanized track maintenance \nin each of the 18 railway administrative bureaus, and 170 mechanized track maintenance teams. \nAs the needs for mechanized maintenance were growing, MOR decided to establish four new \ncomprehensive maintenance centers in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan in 2009. \nThese centers will provide integrated maintenance services to dedicated passenger railways, \nincluding for track, signaling, communication, electrification, and power supply maintenance. \n \n10.  Qualified and well-trained staff are essential for efficient track maintenance. MOR has \nabout  276,000 employees  working  on  track  maintenance,  including  13,600  already  using \nLTMMs. However, many of them do not have any systematic training, and lack the skills and \nknowledge to use the latest LTMMs. Consequently, LTMMs are often poorly used. \n \n11.  MOR has sought to improve track maintenance staff capacity by (i) setting up a training \ncenter in Kunming; and (ii) conducting short-term, on-the-job training for 15,000 employees. In \n2009, heavy and regular track maintenance work by LTMMs reached 5,300 km and 25,000 km, \nrespectively. However, this remains much below current needs, which are set to rise sharply as \nthe new high-speed railway network is put into operation. Moreover, MOR\u2019s current approach to \n                                                 \n4  7,055 km of high speed railways were put in operation by the end of September 2010. \n5  ADB. 2005.

Support  for  improving  railway  efficiency  and  safety,  and  railway  modernization,  is \nincluded  among  the  indicative  areas  for  interventions  identified  in  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \npartnership strategy, 2008\u20132010. \n \n13.  The government seeks ADB assistance to help the PRC railway obtain information on \ninternational best practices in mechanized maintenance, prepare a 5-year capacity development \nplan for railway track maintenance staff, and develop a training program for LTMM operators. \nThe proposed TA will be an integral part of ADB\u2019s lending and technical assistance support for \nrailways development in the PRC. It will ensure that mechanized maintenance can help improve \nrailway  system\u2019s  performance  and  safety.  The  government  has  assessed  previous  ADB \ntechnical assistance support for railways as relevant, effective, and efficient,6 and considers it \nan important complement to the lending operations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the proposed TA will be high quality and efficient track maintenance. The \nachievement of this impact will be demonstrated through increased productivity of maintenance \noperations and increased use of mechanized maintenance. The outcome of the TA will be \nimproved capacity for track maintenance. As a result of the TA, it is expected that MOR will \n(i) adopt a 5-year plan and accompanying recommendations for the capacity development of \ntrack maintenance staff, (ii) carry out on a routine basis a LTMM training program reflecting best \ninternational practices, and (iii) increase the number of qualified full-time LTMM trainers by \n300%. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  To achieve these objectives, the TA will (i) develop a 5-year capacity development plan \nfor track maintenance staff, (ii) prepare a LTMM training program and syllabus, and (iii) organize \noverseas and domestic training of LTMM trainers. \n \n16.  To prepare the 5-year capacity development plan, the TA will (i) assess current track \nmaintenance staff capacity in the PRC, through conducting a survey and comparing the results \nwith  track  maintenance  staff  capacity  in  industrialized  countries;  (ii)  review  the  current \norganization, policies, and operational practices for track maintenance, and compare them with \ninternational best practices; (iii) assess future track maintenance staffing and skills needs, \ntaking into account network expansion, the increased use of mechanized maintenance, and \ninnovation;  and  (iv) review  initial  and  continuous  on-the-job  training  on  track  maintenance, \nincluding the strategy, programs, and delivery methods, compare them with best practices in \nindustrialized countries, and recommend improvements to the training.  \n \n17.  The LTMM training program and syllabus will be prepared after an in-depth review of \n(i) similar training programs in industrialized countries, (ii) training materials routinely delivered \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2009.

Using the results of this \nreview and within the framework of the 5-year plan, the TA will propose a training strategy and \ndelivery methods for LTMM training for the various classes of staff.7 Training materials and \nteaching methods will need to be effective and adapted to the PRC, while incorporating relevant \ninternational best practices. The TA will also provide recommendations for potential multimedia \ntraining or simulation software to be developed later by MOR. \n \n18.  The TA will provide overseas training for about 10 LTMM trainers in an internationally \nrecognized LTMM training institution. These trainers will help to formulate the LTMM training \nprogram and conduct training of about 20 other trainers using the new program. \n \n19.  Two review workshops will be held\u2014one at the inception stage and one at the interim \nstage. A seminar will be arranged at the draft final report stage to disseminate the TA findings. \nThe proposed TA will be undertaken in close consultation with relevant departments of MOR \nand  other  relevant  agencies,  taking  into  consideration  previous  studies  carried  out  by  the \ngovernment,  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment, and multilateral agencies. MOR will provide the consultants with all relevant \nmaterials, studies, and reports required for undertaking the TA, and MOR will also assist in \narranging  the  workshops  and  seminar  and  in  liaising  with  other  relevant  agencies  and \nstakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent. The government has requested that \nADB finance $400,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide the remaining $100,000 in kind for \ncounterpart  staff,  office  space  with  furniture,  utilities  and  telecommunication  access,  local \ntransport, and other services. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The MOR will be the executing agency for the TA, which is included in the list of 2010 \nTA projects for delegation to executing agencies. ADB's Central Operations Services Office \nconducted a  detailed  capacity  assessment  to  determine  MOR\u2019s  capacity.  The  assessment \nconcluded that MOR\u2019s capacity is satisfactory and recommended approving the delegation of \nthe TA to MOR, based on the enhanced partnership approach detailed in the memorandum of \nunderstanding between ADB and the Ministry of Finance. The MOR will be responsible for the \nadministration of the TA, and ADB will focus on contract supervision, fiduciary control, and the \ndissemination of knowledge outcomes.8 \n \n22.  The TA will engage an international consulting firm through the quality- and cost-based \nselection method, using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and a simplified technical proposal. The TA \nwill require 3 international consultants (8 person-months in total) and 6 national consultants \n(20 person-months). They will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n7  It includes new staff, staff whose skills need to be upgraded, LTMM operators, LTMM maintenance staff, and the \nmanagers of mechanized track maintenance teams. \n8  For details, see the MOU between ADB and the PRC on the Enhanced Partnership on TA Delegation to the EA, \n30 November 2009 \n ", "  5\n23.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  advanced \npayment facility could be used to conduct training, seminars, and workshops. Equipment will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n24.  The TA is expected to begin in July 2011 and be completed by December 2011. The \nconsultants will submit the following reports to MOR and ADB: (i) an inception report, 3 weeks \nafter work starts, (ii) an interim report after 10 weeks, (iii) a draft final report after 20 weeks, and \n(iv) a final report, 2 weeks after receipt of review comments from MOR and ADB. The final \nreport will include: (i) a 5-year capacity development plan for railway track maintenance staff; \n(ii) a  LTMM  syllabus  and  training  materials;  (iii)  a  policy  note  on  how  to  enhance  track \nmaintenance performance; and (iv) an executive summary. \n \n25.  Major project activities will be regularly monitored by ADB administration missions and \nMOR. Consultants\u2019 reports will be presented at workshops and seminars organized to validate \nand disseminate their findings. Reports will be made available on ADB\u2019s website in English and \nChinese. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Capacity Development for Railway Track \nMaintenance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Targets and/or  Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nHigh quality, efficient  From 2009 to 2016,  Government statistics and  Government and MOR \ntrack maintenance  track maintenance  Ministry of Railways  commitment to developing \ndeveloped in the PRC  productivity, as  (MOR) statistics  capacity for track \nmeasured by the route  maintenance \nlength per track   \nmaintenance staff,   \nincreases from 0.312   \nkm/person in 2009 to   \n0.436 km/person in \n2010. \n \nTrack maintenance by \nlarge track \nmaintenance \nmachines (LTMMs) \nincreases from 30,000 \nkm in 2009 to 42,000 \nkm in 2016. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nCapacity for track  Plan and  Asian Development Bank  The government accepts the \nmaintenance is  recommendations are  (ADB) technical assistance  5-year plan for staff capacity \nimproved.  adopted by MOR by  (TA) completion report  development and the \n  31 July 2012.    training program. \n    MOR's plans, reports, \nOverseas and domestic \nLTMM training program  guidelines, and regulations \ntraining of trainers is well \nand syllabus are carried  on track maintenance \norganized. \nout by MOR by   \n \n1 September 2012. \nRisks \n \nThe plan and training \nThe number of qualified \nprogram are not fully \nLTMM full-time trainers \nimplemented. \nincreases from 5 in \n2009 to 15 by  Trainers move out or are \n1 September 2012.  given another assignment \n  after receiving overseas and \ndomestic training under this \nTA. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
