THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to B1,500,000,000 (or its equivalent in United States dollars) to Energy Absolute Public \nCompany Limited for the Green Loan for Renewable Energy and Electric Vehicle Charging \nNetwork in Thailand. \n \n2.  The project entails a corporate loan with a 3-year tenor to support the ongoing renewable \nenergy and sustainable transport activities of Energy Absolute Public Company Limited (Energy \nAbsolute). The loan will be used to finance two of Energy Absolute\u2019s operating solar and wind \nprojects in Thailand (the Nakornsawan Solar Power Project and the Hanuman Wind Power \nProject), as well as Energy Absolute\u2019s ongoing investment in a comprehensive electric vehicle \ncharging network (EVCN) in Thailand. This green loan1 is expected to be the first certified climate \nloan in Thailand2 and one of the first in Asia. The assistance of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will support Thailand\u2019s renewable energy sector, increase awareness about green loans, \nand support the transition from a conventional automotive industry to an electric vehicle industry \nin  Thailand  by  establishing  a  comprehensive  EVCN  across  Thailand\u2019s  major  cities.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance will also support a leading clean energy and sustainable transport company in \nThailand at a time when capital markets are still adjusting to the ongoing disruptions caused by \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. ADB has built strong relationships with key participants in the Thai \nenergy and transport sectors since 2009. ADB supported Energy Absolute\u2019s maiden green bond \nissuance in 2019,3 and has been discussing the company\u2019s ongoing sustainable transport and \nclean energy plans. Energy Absolute is a climate and green investment leader in the region and \nthe company sees ADB as a valuable partner to support their strategy. Energy Absolute\u2019s strategy \nis strongly aligned with Thailand\u2019s industrial, climate and electric mobility targets, and ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 commitments to climate mitigation.4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n4.  ADB has increased its efforts to promote green financial instruments, such as green bonds \nand loans. Green loans help to provide a mechanism for financing investments in green and \nclimate-smart projects that are aligned with the Paris Agreement on climate change and the \nUnited Nations\u2019 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Green Loan Principles5 (GLP) \nsupport the promotion of environmentally sustainable lending practices. Green loans can be \ncertified as climate loans under the Climate Bonds Standard and Certification Scheme (footnote \n2) which is the most prominent labelling scheme for green bonds and green loans globally, and \nis designed to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well \nunder 2\u00b0C. \n \n1  A green loan is a loan used to finance or re-finance, in whole or in part, new and/or existing projects with \nenvironmental benefits. Climate loans are focused on climate change benefits in particular. \n2  Certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative. https://www.climatebonds.net/certification. \n3  ADB. Thailand.

Manila. \n5  The Green Loan Principles were developed by the Loan Market Association, the Asia Pacific Loan Market \nAssociation and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, based on the Green Bond Principles developed by \nthe International Capital Market Association. ", "2  \n \n5.  Although the global market for green bonds has grown rapidly, green loans have remained \na relatively less well-known instrument. The project will contribute to the greening of Thailand\u2019s \nfinance markets by showcasing international best practice approaches to green loan verification \nand certification. This green loan is expected to be the first certified climate loan in Thailand. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been increasing its focus on sectors \nother than energy. Transport is typically a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions. The transport sector makes up around 26% of Thailand\u2019s annual GHG emissions. \nElectrification of vehicles and decarbonization of the transport sector are widely seen as a critical \nchallenge to meet commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Electric vehicles can help to \nreduce transport sector GHG emissions while reducing local air pollution. Thailand is aiming to \nbecome a regional leader in electric vehicles with long-term targets to substantially increase the \nnumber of electric vehicles on Thailand\u2019s roads and expand public charging infrastructure. \n \n7.  Project description. The Project entails a corporate loan of up to B1.5 billion with a 3-\nyear tenor to support Energy Absolute\u2019s ongoing renewable energy and sustainable transport \nactivities during a time when the company faces increased uncertainty with debt raising due to \nCOVID-19. The loan will be used for the financing of two of Energy Absolute\u2019s operating solar and \nwind projects in Thailand (the Nakornsawan Solar Power Project and the Hanuman Wind Power \nProject), as well as Energy Absolute\u2019s ongoing efforts to establish a comprehensive EVCN in \nThailand. Thailand has long-term ambitions to be an electric vehicle hub of Southeast Asia and \nEnergy Absolute is positioning itself to be a leader in this sector, with plans to develop battery and \nelectric vehicle manufacturing capacity as well as a comprehensive EVCN in Thailand comprising \nat least 3,600 charging stations by 2023. \n \n8.  Borrower. Energy Absolute was established in 2006 and is the largest renewable energy \ncompany in Thailand by installed capacity. Its main businesses are renewable energy generation \n(solar and wind), and biodiesel production and distribution.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which targets that 75% of ADB operations should support climate change \nmitigation and adaptation by 2030, and that ADB assistance for climate finance total $80 billion \nduring 2019\u20132030 (footnote 4). ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 also promotes the expansion of private \nsector operations into sustainable transport and urban transport. ADB\u2019s support for the project is \nalso in line with its country partnership strategy (2013\u20132016),10 and country operations business \nplan  (2020\u20132022)11 for  Thailand,  which  promote  private  sector  development,  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and environmentally sustainable development. The proposed project also aligns \nwith the forthcoming country partnership strategy 2021\u20132025 for Thailand, which will emphasize \nsustainable and resilient growth, and the role of non-sovereign operations. \n \n19.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments \nin energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.12 \n \n20.  Lessons from previous operations. ADB\u2019s private sector operations department has \nsupported a number of renewable energy projects and climate aligned financings in Thailand, \nincluding ADB\u2019s first loan to Energy Absolute for the Energy Absolute Green Bond for Wind Power \nProject in 2019 (footnote 3).13 ADB can play a valuable role in assisting with the certification of \ngreen financial products such as loans and bonds. ADB\u2019s involvement in such projects can \nprovide strong market validation and help increase awareness of climate aligned investments. As \nADB\u2019s first private sector EVCN investment, the project will also contribute to important lessons \nfor future electric mobility opportunities across Asia and the Pacific. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The project entails a B1.5 billion non-amortizing corporate loan with a tenor of 3 years and \na bullet repayment. The loan proceeds will be used to finance two of Energy Absolute\u2019s operating \nrenewable power projects, and to support the establishment of a comprehensive EVCN in \nThailand. The two renewable energy projects are currently financed with corporate bonds and \nloans which are maturing in July 2020 and early 2021, respectively. Energy Absolute is facing \nuncertainties regarding their ongoing financing activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.14 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Energy Absolute\u2019s solar and wind power plants are developed under Thailand\u2019s SPP \nprogram, which allows private developers to build, own, and operate energy power projects \nof 10\u201390 MW capacity and to enter into PPAs with EGAT. \nThe installation of electric vehicle charging stations requires approval from the Energy \nRegulatory Commission under Energy Industry Act B.E. 2550. \nManagement  Energy Absolute\u2019s senior management consists of experienced professionals with extensive \nmanagerial and technical knowledge in renewable energy and finance. As of May 2020, \nEnergy Absolute\u2019s management has overseen the successful development and operation of \nsix renewable energy plants with a total installed capacity of 664 MW. It is also developing \na lithium-ion battery factory in Thailand, electric cars, electric ferries, and associated \ncharging infrastructure. \nRevenue structure  Energy Absolute sells electricity to EGAT under the SPP program. Revenue is fully \ncontracted, with long-term PPAs with creditworthy offtakers. Energy Absolute\u2019s electric \nvehicle charging stations are located in prime locations in partnership with various major \npartners, mostly in malls, residential estates, office buildings, hospitals, convenience stores, \nand gas stations. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nOperation and  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nmaintenance \nClimate loan  Energy Absolute\u2019s green loan will be certified as a climate loan under the CBS and will also \ncertification  adhere to the GLP. To obtain CBS certification, the underlying projects must comply with \nthe relevant sector criteria. For this project, it is expected that the financing will comply with \nthe following sector criteria under the CBS; low carbon transport; solar energy; wind energy. \nTo maintain climate loan certification under the CBS, the company will need to provide an \nannual monitoring report to (i) confirm that it has not disposed of or otherwise refinanced the \nunderlying asset and (ii) present the operational performance of the projects such as \nmegawatt-hours of renewable energy generation delivered or total kWh of electricity \nprovided through the charging network. \nPerformance  The company will submit quarterly unaudited financial statements and annual audited \nmonitoring  financial statements on a consolidated basis. \nCBS = Climate Bonds Standard; EGAT = Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand; Energy Absolute = Energy \nAbsolute Public Company Limited; GLP = Green Loan Principles; kWh = kilowatt-hour; MW = megawatt; O&M = \noperation and maintenance; PPA = power purchase agreement; SPP = small power producer. \nSource: Energy Absolute Public Company Limited. \n \nF.

ADB will provide debt financing to Energy Absolute in the form of a non-amortizing \ncorporate loan of up to B1.5 billion (or its equivalent in United States dollars) with a 3-year tenor \nand a bullet repayment. ADB\u2019s assistance will support the financing and operation of two of \nEnergy Absolute\u2019s renewable power projects and the establishment of a comprehensive EVCN in \n \n14 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nThailand. ADB will also ensure that the loan will be recognized as a certified climate loan. This is \nexpected to be the first Climate Bonds Initiative certified climate loan in Thailand from only the \nsecond issuer of a certified climate loan in Asia. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s participation in the transaction will ensure that the loan will comply with the Green \nLoan Principles (footnote 5) and will be certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative under the Climate \nBonds Standard and Certification Scheme as a climate loan (footnote 2). Green loans are even \nless well recognized than green bonds, and ADB\u2019s support will help make the climate finance \nbenefits of certified climate loans better known in the region. Obtaining climate loan certification \nwill help contribute to greater awareness of the potential to align the finance sector with the Paris \nAgreement,  and  the  United  Nations\u2019  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance will support the continued operation of Energy Absolute\u2019s existing renewable energy \npower projects, which provide zero GHG-emission electricity to the Thai grid. This is especially \nimportant during a highly uncertain time in which the company is facing increased uncertainty \nraising debt and is seeking to diversify funding sources. ADB\u2019s assistance will also support the \nimplementation of what will be one of Southeast Asia\u2019s largest EVCNs. Energy Absolute\u2019s \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) complies with ADB standards and will \npromote higher standards for the supported projects. \n \n27.  Support during COVID-19 pandemic. ADB\u2019s involvement will help Energy Absolute at a \ntime when financial markets and banks are adjusting to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 \npandemic. The pandemic has caused increased uncertainty for Energy Absolute\u2019s capital raising. \n \n28.  Electric vehicle charging network. The project will be the first investment by ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department to support the establishment of a comprehensive EVCN. \nElectrification of vehicles and decarbonization of the transport sector is widely seen as a critical \nobjective to meet the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Even if charged using a \ngrid that uses power generated from fossil fuels, electric vehicles can still reduce GHG-emissions \ncompared to internal combustion engine vehicles. In addition, fully battery powered electric \nvehicles do not produce local exhaust pipe air pollutants (e.g. carbon monoxide, lead, ground-\nlevel ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide). ADB\u2019s involvement will \nsignificantly enhance market awareness of Thailand\u2019s activities in the electric vehicle sector and \ndemonstrate the role high-level technology can play in the urban transport sector for ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries. \n \nC.
