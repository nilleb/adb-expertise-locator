The Government of Viet Nam has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nconsider  financing  revenue  generating  projects  in  power  generation  using  ordinary  capital \nresources. Based on discussions with the Government, it was decided to prepare the Song \nBung 4 Hydropower Project (the proposed Project) for ordinary capital resources financing in \n2006.1 Given the complex environmental and social issues associated with hydropower projects, \nit was decided to undertake the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) in two phases. \nThe Phase I2 identified the key environmental, social, and water resources management issues, \nand defined the scope of work to be undertaken during Phase II. At the conclusion of Phase I, \nan ADB fact-finding mission visited Viet Nam from 10 to 22 March 2005 and reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  cost,  financing,  implementation \narrangements, and outline terms of reference for PPTA Phase II. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The power sector\u2019s key challenge is to provide adequate system capacity to meet rapid \ngrowth in electricity demand. Demand has been growing at an average rate of 14.6% during the \npast 5 years, underpinned by economic growth of 7%\u20138%. According to the latest projections of \nElectricity of Viet Nam (EVN), energy sales are expected to increase from 34.8 terawatt-hour \n(TWh) in 2003 to 80.4 TWh by 2010, and maximum power demand is projected to rise from \n7,366 megawatt (MW) to 16,766 MW during the same period. \n \n3.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  objective  for  the  sector  is  to  create  an  institutional  and \nregulatory  framework  that  mobilizes  investment  from  internal  and  external  sources  in  a \nfinancially  and  fiscally  sustainable  manner.  The  Electricity  Law,  2004,  provides  the  legal \nframework for transparent regulation and the creation of a competitive wholesale electricity \nmarket. The power sector restructuring plan\u2015aimed at corporatizing and partially privatizing \n(commonly referred to as equitizing in Viet Nam) the majority of EVN-owned power plants and \ndistribution units, and creating a competitive wholesale power market and regulatory body\u2015is \nexpected to be approved by the Government later this year. The Government has requested \nfurther technical assistance (TA) from ADB to implement these reforms and set up a regulatory \nframework for the sector.  \n \n4.  Hydropower currently accounts for about 46% of Viet Nam\u2019s electricity generation. The \nGovernment\u2019s fifth electricity master plan (2000\u20132010) identifies the importance of expanding \nhydropower\u2014along with other generation technologies and efficiency improvements\u2014to meet \nfuture electricity needs. The national hydropower plan and the sixth master plan (2006\u20132015) \ncurrently  under  preparation  have  applied  technical,  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nscreening criteria to a range of projects across the country. Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project is \nselected for implementation from 2007 to 2011, based on economic screening and preparatory \nwork already undertaken by the Government. Initial project screening undertaken during PPTA \n                                                 \n1 The Country Strategy and Program (CSP) Update 2005\u20132006 referred to this Project as the Power Generation \nDevelopment Project and the corresponding project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was included in the \nCSP Update 2004\u20132006. The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet \nedition) on 20 May 2004. \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Song Bung 4 Hydropower \nProject Phase I. Manila.   \n ", "2   \nPhase I and the national hydropower plan indicated that the proposed Project is economically \nattractive, and the social and environmental impacts can be mitigated.  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy  recognizes  the  value  of  hydropower  as  a  renewable  resource \neligible for ADB support, provided adverse social and environmental impacts are minimized, and \nthe livelihoods of project-affected people are improved. Given the multipurpose nature, and \nsocial  and  environmental  issues  associated  with  large  hydropower  projects,  private  sector \ninvestment focuses on small hydropower (i.e., less than 100 MW) and thermal power projects. \nPublic sector investment targets large hydropower projects. The Government is committed to \npartially privatizing most public sector power plants, including the proposed Project.  \n \n6.  The Law on Water Resources, 1998, provides the legal and institutional framework for \nwater resource management in Viet Nam, including establishing a National Water Resource \nCouncil  to  coordinate  water  resource  management  issues  among  different  ministries.  The \nMinistry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE)  is  responsible  for  state  water \nresource  management  and  is  the  licensing  authority  for  major  water  resources  projects, \nincluding  hydropower  projects.  However,  guidelines  and  institutions  for  ensuring  integrated \nwater resource management (IWRM) at the national and provincial levels are still evolving. \nPPTA Phase II will consider the concerns of the river basin\u2019s other water users and appropriate \nrecommendations will be made to project design and operational rules to incorporate IWRM \nprinciples in the prevailing institutional environment (including watershed management-related \nissues) and minimize downstream impacts due to changes in flow regime and water quality.  \n \n7.  The proposed Project is located in the Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin in Quang Nam \nProvince. The river basin\u2019s catchment area is mountainous and sparsely populated, and subject \nto  floods  during  the  wet  season  and  the  very  low  dry  season  flows,  which  cause  water \nshortages  for  irrigation  and  saline  intrusion.  Hydropower  projects  in  the  river  basin  with \nassociated reservoirs are expected to help alleviate these problems by making the annual water \nflow more uniform. A pilot demonstration activity supported by ADB\u2019s Water Cooperation Fund \nis proposed to be undertaken in parallel with PPTA Phase II to (i) introduce stakeholders to \nIWRM  principles  and  the  importance  of  multi-sector  coordination,  (ii)  undertake  modeling \nstudies to determine the scale of cumulative impacts caused by future development of the river \nbasin, and (iii) make recommendations to operationalize IWRM principles in the river basin. \n \n8.  Initial screening of the project\u2019s environmental and social issues  were undertaken during \nPhase I, which identified the key environmental issues: (i)  potential loss of biodiversity and \nthreats to the integrity to Song Thanh Nature Reserve, (ii) threats to the sustainability of the \nwatershed  and  reservoir  due  to  extensive  gold  mining  and  soil  erosion  caused  by  road \nconstruction, and (iii) the need to establish baseline information on aquatic resources and forest \ncover in project-affected areas. Social issues include the lifestyle, traditions, and vulnerability of \nproject-affected communities, and the need to plan and design social mitigation measures in a \nculturally sensitive manner. In particular, livelihood opportunities, including access to forest \nresources,  need  to  be  identified  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Compensation  for  communities \naffected due to changes in the water flow in downstream areas would be discussed with the \nGovernment. \n \n9.  The proposed Project would be subject to ADB\u2019s safeguard policies on environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people.  The  PPTA  Phase  I  concluded  that \nimprovements to project design may be introduced in the current planning process to meet ADB \nsafeguard policies. The proposed Project would consider relevant aspects of ADB\u2019s water \npolicy, including principles of IWRM and participatory process. Stakeholders would be fully ", "  3\ninformed of the proposed Project and their views would be considered in the project design. The \nproposed  Project  would  be  the  first  hydropower  project  in  Viet  Nam  to  be  financed  by  a \nmultilateral financing institution. ADB\u2019s safeguard and other social sector policies\u2014and the \nimplementation  of  the  resulting  environment  management  plan,  resettlement  plan,  ethnic \nminority development plan, gender action plan, and public health action plan\u2014would set an \nexample of environmentally and socially sustainable hydropower development in Viet Nam. It \nwould also provide an opportunity to incorporate livelihood improvement and poverty reduction \nmeasures for the project-affected population, and take a proactive approach to mitigate and \nmanage the environmental impacts.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Output \n10.  The TA\u2019s objective is to prepare the 165 MW Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project (the \nProject) located in Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin in Quang Nam Province, central Viet Nam, for \nADB financing. A dam (120 meters [m] high, 360 m long, and 340 m wide) would be built across \nthe Bung River, creating a reservoir with a storage capacity of 621 million cubic meters (m3) and \na surface area of 18.4 square kilometers (km2). It has been estimated that reservoir inundation \nwould require resettlement of 185 mainly ethnic minority families (940 individuals). The total \nproject cost has been estimated at D3,425 billion ($218 million) at the pre-feasibility study stage. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The master plan for hydropower in the Vu Gia\u2013Thu Bon river basin was approved by the \nMinistry of Industries3 under the authority of the Prime Minister, and the proposed Project was \nidentified as a priority project in the river basin. The proposed Project\u2019s pre-feasibility study was \ncompleted in 2003 and the feasibility study is currently being carried out by the executing \nagency\u2019s domestic consultants. PPTA Phase II consultants will review the technical, social, and \nenvironmental studies already undertaken as part of the proposed Project\u2019s basin master plan, \npre-feasibility, and feasibility studies. PPTA Phase II consultants will analyze in detail (i) the \nhydrology of the river system, soil, and geotechnical conditions of the dam site and tunnels, (ii) \nthe proposed design for the dam and the power plant, (iii) resettlement plans and mitigation and \nlivelihood improvement measures for project affected people, and (iv) environmental impacts \nand management plans, including measures to protect the upper watershed. They will also \nprovide assistance to the executing agency and its consultants to prepare detailed engineering \ndesigns and bidding documents. \n12.  The PPTA Phase II will undertake several initiatives to achieve an integrated water \nresource management approach, including stakeholder consultations, and views expressed \nwould be included in the project design. The river basin stakeholder group formed under the \nproposed  pilot  demonstration  activity  mentioned  in  para.  7  will  review  and  oversee  the \nconsultation process. Hydrological studies will be undertaken to determine the downstream \nimpacts, to optimize and coordinate the operation of the proposed Project, and to ensure \noptimum water resource allocation among different water users. The PPTA Phase II will also \npropose institutional arrangements to promote sustainable participatory watershed management \npractices  for  the  operational  phase  of  the  proposed  Project\u2014land  use,  water  quality,  and \nbiological diversity conservation\u2014in close collaboration with MONRE and provincial authorities. \nPilot activities for watershed management to be carried out during the construction phase of the \nproposed Project will be considered.  \n                                                 \n3 Decision No. 875/QD\u2013KHDT dated 2 May 2003. \n ", "4   \n \n13.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard polices for involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous and ethnic minority peoples, as well as its policy on gender and development, \nthe PPTA Phase II will build on the initial assessments of social and environmental issues \nidentified during Phase I, and conduct social analysis and public consultations to confirm the \nlikely social impacts of the proposed Project. The PPTA Phase II will review the preliminary \nresettlement plan prepared during the government\u2019s feasibility study and revise it as appropriate \nin  accordance  with  ADB  requirements.  The  resettlement  plan  and  the  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  plan  (EMDP)  will  be  prepared  for  all  people  affected  by  reservoir  flooding, \ndownstream impacts, and land acquisition for project-related construction work, access roads, \ntransmission  lines,  and  substations.  Given  the  interrelated  nature  of  downstream  impacts \ncaused by several other projects in the river basin, and the poor socioeconomic conditions of \nethnic  minorities  inhabiting  the  river  basin,  it  is  proposed  that  a  complementary  livelihood \nrestoration  project  be  prepared  under  the  PPTA.  It  is  expected  that  this  would  cover \napproximately  5,000  indigenous  people  in  the  project  area  who  are  not  covered  by  the \nresettlement plan. It will take a development approach by enhancing their livelihoods in a \nsustainable manner. The PPTA Phase II will conduct a gender analysis and prepare a gender \naction  plan  (GAP),  including  a  HIV/AIDS4  awareness  plan,  and  mainstream  it  into  project \ndocuments. The TA will assess project-related health risks and prepare a public health action \nplan (PHAP). The summary initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environment  policy  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), PPTA consultants will conduct an environmental impact assessment (EIA). \nThis will be done in close collaboration with MONRE to ensure that the EIAs undertaken by \ngovernment authorities and PPTA consultants are consistent. The consultants are expected to \nfacilitate knowledge transfer to MONRE and provincial authorities on environmental assessment \nof  hydropower  projects.  The  EIA  will  include  an  assessment  of  the  impacts  on  physical, \nbiological, and related impacts on the social environment. The cumulative impacts\u2014due to other \nhydropower projects in the Vu-Gia subbasin\u2014will be addressed, and the temporal and spatial \ndistribution of impacts will be determined. The EIA will include mitigatory measures and an \neconomic assessment of alternatives.  \n \n15.  A  conservation  offset5  would  be  prepared  by  the  PPTA  Phase  II  in  a  manner \ncomplementary to the Greater Mekong Subregion Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative.6 \nThis may involve supporting selected parts of the Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative \nunder the  proposed Project. The impacts will be assessed, including downstream impacts \nassociated with the construction and operation of the dam and the reservoir, as well as the \nimpacts of the 220 kV transmission line, access roads, and other construction sites. Necessary \nmitigation measures and environmental monitoring requirements will be incorporated into an \nenvironment management plan (EMP). The key threats to the upper watershed (soil erosion \ncaused by gold mining and poor road construction techniques) have been identified in Phase I \nand mitigatory measures will be recommended during PPTA Phase II. \n \n16.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  electricity  generation  capacity  expansion  plan\u2014as  described  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s fifth electricity master plan (2000\u20132005) and sixth master plan under preparation \nfor 2006\u20132015\u2014will be reviewed by PPTA Phase II consultants to confirm that the proposed \n                                                 \n4  Human immunodeficiency syndrome/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n5  An intervention to compensate for any habitat or ecosystem function that may be impaired or lost due to the \nproposed Project. \n6  ADB. 2004.

The economic and \nfinancial viability of the proposed Project will be determined and a distribution analysis will be \ncarried out to identify benefits enjoyed and costs borne by different stakeholders. The financial \nsustainability of the sector and EVN\u2014in the context of the increasing investment requirement\u2014\nwill be assessed, and tariff reforms aimed at removing pricing distortions and cross subsidies \nwill be proposed. A risk allocation framework and a time-bound action plan to partially privatize \nthe proposed Project will also be prepared. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the PPTA Phase II is estimated at $2,175,000 equivalent, of which \n$1,275,000 is the foreign exchange cost and $875,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The \nGovernment has requested financing on a grant basis for $975,000 from the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan, and $600,000 from the Government of France for a \ntotal of $1,575,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and $275,000 of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be administered by ADB. EVN will finance the remaining \n$600,000 equivalent of local currency costs through in-kind contributions by the executing and \nimplementing agencies, the cost of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies undertaken by the \nPower Engineering Consulting Company No. 3 (PECC 3), office accommodation and facilities, \nlocal communications, and counterpart staff. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The executing agency for the PPTA Phase II will be EVN and Hydro Power Project \nManagement Board No. 3 (HPPMB 3) will be the implementing agency. HPPMB 3 is a unit of \nEVN with responsibility for managing the implementation of the proposed Project. The PPTA \nPhase II will require about 52 person-months of international and about 35 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. An international consulting firm will be recruited using quality-\nbased selection due to the technically complex nature of the Project based on the full technical \nproposal  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nAn  independent  advisory  panel  on  dam  safety,  environmental,  and  social  issues,  will  be \nrecruited as individual consultants to support the PPTA Phase II. An expert on IWRM and \ninternational best practices in planning hydropower projects will be retained separately to guide \nthe proposed Project\u2019s overall preparation. The PPTA Phase II will be implemented over a 12-\nmonth  period  from  September  2005  to  August  2006.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \nIV.

Viet Nam\u2019s recent success in reducing \nthe share of the population below the poverty line from 70% in 1990 to less than 30% by 2002 is based on rapid but \nequitable economic growth during this period. The availability of cheap and reliable electricity generated from \nindigenous  sources  is  an  essential  requirement  for  sustainable  economic  growth  and  maintaining  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ncompetitiveness as it makes the transition from an agriculture-based to an industrialized economy.
