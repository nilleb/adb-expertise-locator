THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Development Project (SMEDP2), and (ii) the proposed administration of technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for SMEDP2.1 \n \n2.  SMEDP2  comprises  a  financial  intermediary  loan  (FIL)  of  $200  million  to  enable \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs) to provide local-currency loans to small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong.2 An amount \nof $20 million under the FIL is earmarked for women SMEs.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Accelerating growth and reducing poverty, income inequality, and regional disparity are \nthe overarching goals of the current development paradigm in Bangladesh. The development of \nSMEs is seen as a key element in this development strategy, as noted in the Government of \nBangladesh\u2019s Sixth Five-Year Plan for fiscal year (FY) 2011\u2012FY2015.4 To achieve double-digit \neconomic growth as outlined by the government\u2019s Vision 2021 to attain middle-income status by \n2021,5 promoting the SME sector is considered critical. \n \n4.  Small and medium-sized enterprises\u2014overview and constraints. The SME sector in \nBangladesh  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  growth  of  the  country.  According  to  the  most  recent \neconomic census of the country carried out by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics during \nMarch\u2013May 2013, it is estimated that the SME sector comprises 7.2 million firms, which account \nfor 90% of all private enterprises in the country, or even 99% of all firms when micro enterprises \nare included.6 SMEs employ about 70%\u201380% of the nonagricultural workforce and contributed \n25% of Bangladesh\u2019s gross domestic product and 40% of the manufacturing output in 2014.7  \n \n5.  Enhanced SME activities in the rural and backward regions constitute a key component \nof the government\u2019s strategy for rural development, and reduction of poverty and regional \ndisparity, since most firms outside the metropolitan areas of Bangladesh are SMEs. However, \nthe major development challenge in Bangladesh is a sharp metropolitan\u2013nonmetropolitan divide \nin terms of employment and economic growth.8 \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  For the Bangladesh Industrial Policy 2010, see the Detailed Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector Analysis \naccessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n3  Women SMEs are defined as being one of the following: (i) women are the owners or proprietors of a privately run \norganization, or own at least a 51% share in case of a joint-venture vehicle or a company listed with the Office of \nthe Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms; or (ii) at least 60% of the managerial staff are women. \n4  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning. 2011.

Dhaka.  \nhttp://www.bbs.gov.bd/PageWebMenuContent.aspx?MenuKey=347 \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance and Leasing (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8 As per the provisional figures of the economic census conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, \n5.81 million enterprises were located in rural areas and 2.25 million enterprises in urban areas.  ", "2 \n6.  A survey carried out by the Bangladesh Integrated Support to Poverty and Inequality \nReduction through Enterprise Development (INSPIRED) identified the following main constraints \non SME growth: (i) inadequate access to finance, especially long-term funding; (ii) inadequate \nsupplies of utilities (mainly electricity) and infrastructure (especially poor transportation); and (iii) \nincreasing  costs  of  labor  and  lack  of  skilled  labor,  particularly  in  manufacturing.9 These \nconstraints are also reflected in the 2015 Doing Business Survey of the World Bank, which \nranks Bangladesh 173rd out of 189 economies.10 \n \n7.  The backward and forward links of SMEs to the formal sector, particularly the larger \nexport-driven  industries,  are  severely  underdeveloped  in  Bangladesh.  Backward  links  are \nessential to reduce the production cost of products to make them more competitive in both the \ndomestic and foreign markets. Forward links are also missing: SMEs in Bangladesh, especially \nsmall ones, do not have enough capital resources and know-how to market their products to a \nwider market base. For industries to succeed in the current globalized economic environment, \nforming horizontal and vertical links is crucial. This can be done by forming alliances, clustering, \nand networking among SMEs to compete effectively domestically and internationally. \n \n8.  Access  to  finance. The banking sector in Bangladesh continues to be the largest \nprovider of credit to the SME sector. Bank lending to SMEs amounted to Tk834 billion (about \n$10.7 billion) or 97.8% of total SME loans in 2013. The remaining 2.2% came from nonbank \nfinancial institutions. The banking sector has been burdened by high levels of nonperforming \nloans, which were accumulated over many years primarily because of weak management of the \nstate-owned banks. Although the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans has declined from \n13.2% in March 2008 to 9.7% at the end of December 2014, it is still high.11 Although private \nsector credit among banks grew by 13.6% in the third quarter of FY2015, this was a decline \nfrom FY2010 and FY2011, when banks expanded their credit portfolio by 24.2% and 25.8%. \n \n9.  The  actual  delivery  of  institutional  credit  to  SMEs  has  been  grossly  inadequate  in \nBangladesh.  This  is  re-emphasized  by  the  findings  from  the  INSPIRED  survey,  which \nhighlighted that 68.6% of small enterprises and 44.7% of medium-sized enterprises identified \naccess to finance as a major constraint.12 Based on analysis by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the overall demand\u2013supply gap for SME credit is estimated to exceed Tk529 billion \n($6.8 billion). This gap is even more pronounced for nonmetropolitan SMEs\u2014SME lending is \nconcentrated in urban areas, thereby limiting the potential of rural development. \n \n10.  Women in Bangladesh are not reaching their economic potential. Most engage in small, \nsubsistence-based  activities  in  trade  and  retail,  but  they  are  less  educated  and  have \nsignificantly less access to SME finance than men.13 Women often lack the business skills, \nknowledge, and access to networks to increase their entrepreneurial capacity. The rates of \nwomen entrepreneurship are lower among rural nonfarm enterprises than metropolitan firms. \nNonmetropolitan enterprises owned by women are smaller, younger, and more likely to be \ninformal and home-based. \n                                                \n9  J.

This ratio has remained stable over the last 5 years. \n ", "3 \n11.  Enabling environment. Lessons from previous FILs suggest that successful projects \nneed to build on operationalizing three basic institutional pillars: (i) a credit information bureau, \n(ii) registration of movable and immovable property, and (iii) business development services.14  \n \n12.  The government facilitated the automation of the Credit Information Bureau (CIB) at \nBangladesh Bank to ensure the availability of a credit history for SMEs. Bangladesh Bank \nlaunched CIB online services in July 2011 to provide quick reports to banks and nonbank \nfinancial institutions. In addition, most credit rating agencies operating in Bangladesh assign \ncredit  ratings  to  some  of  the  larger  SMEs.  These  efforts  broaden  the  coverage  of  SME \nborrowers and help banks shift from purely collateral-based lending to cash-flow-based lending. \nEfforts are also ongoing\u2014supported by the World Bank\u2014to expand the coverage of the CIB \nservices to include the cottage industry and micro segment of the SME sector.15  \n \n13.  While the registration of immovable property operates well in Bangladesh, a structured \nand  modern  secured  transaction  system  is  still  absent  because  the  legal  and  institutional \nframeworks for taking security in movable property are fragmented, incomplete, and opaque. As \na result, lenders lack the confidence to extend credit secured only by movable property, which \nlimits the availability of crucial secured financing alternatives for SMEs. The World Bank Group\u2019s \nInternational Finance Corporation is currently providing TA to support secured lending and to \nestablish a movable collateral policy, which is expected to help the under-banked segment of \nBangladesh\u2019s population to access bank financing. \n \n14.  The government provides business support and capacity development TA to SMEs, \nmainly  through  the  Bangladesh  Small  and  Cottage  Industries  Corporation  (BSCIC),  SME \nFoundation (SMEF), and Bangladesh Bank. Among the development partners in Bangladesh, \none of the largest projects in the field of SME business development services is KATALYST \n(developing business service markets), funded by several bilateral development agencies.16 \n \n15.  ADB support for small and medium-sized enterprise development in Bangladesh. \nSince the early 1970s, the Government of Bangladesh and ADB have engaged in extensive \npolicy dialogue on SME sector development.17 Recent interventions include the SME Sector \nDevelopment Program, which created a policy and regulatory framework conducive to SME \ngrowth. 18  This  was  followed  by  the  first  SME  Development  Project  (SMEDP1),  which \naccelerated SME development in rural areas by boosting their access to medium- and long-term \ncredit with an emphasis on women-led SMEs.19 Lessons from SMEDP1 were incorporated in \n                                                \n14 A special evaluation study prepared by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department in 2012 on ADB\u2019s Microfinance \nDevelopment Strategy 2000 highlighted, in particular, the need for strengthening financial literacy among micro and \nsmall borrowers in ADB\u2019s developing member countries. This recommendation was incorporated into the design of \nSMEDP2 by using part of the attached technical assistance to establish incubation facilities at educational \ninstitutions and thereby promote entrepreneurship and access to finance. \n15 The finance sector support project of the World Bank\u2014approved in May 2015\u2014will help broaden the CIB\u2019s scope \nto include credit information pertaining to the microfinance segment.

These interventions enabled ADB to gain an in-depth understanding of Bangladesh\u2019s SME sector \nand built the fundamentals that led to the proposed project. \n18\nADB. 2004.

The \ncredit assistance loan of $76 million under SMEDP1 was fully disbursed by December 2013\u20141 year before the \nend of the utilization period. \n ", "4 \nthe design of SMEDP2.20 The proposed intervention is designed primarily as a credit line to the \nSME sector.21 It is backed up by measures to strengthen access to credit and support the \nbackward and forward links of SMEs to the formal sectors through a capacity development TA, \nall of which supports the government\u2019s development agenda. SMEDP2 is a continuation of the \nsuccessful collaboration between ADB and the government under SMEDP1.22 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The  impact  will  be  continued  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through  the \ndevelopment  of the  SME  sector  outside  the metropolitan  areas  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong, \naligned with the SME Strategy Paper for the government\u2019s forthcoming Seventh Five-Year \nPlan.23 The outcome is increased in the number and size of commercially viable SMEs, as well \nas employment in the SME sector. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  Output  1:  Increased  medium-  and  long-term  credit,  especially  to  SMEs,  SME \nclusters, and BSCIC estates in rural areas. SMEDP2 will comprise a credit line of $200 \nmillion for boosting access to medium- and long-term financing through PFIs for eligible SMEs \n(and eligible SMEs organized as SME clusters and BSCIC estates) outside the metropolitan \nareas of Dhaka and Chittagong.24 The credit line will enhance credit delivery, in particular to \npriority sectors, consistent with the national industrial strategy for promoting exports and high \nvalue-added  industries.  The  strategy  targets  SMEs  in  the  rural  areas  and  will  have  two \ncomponents: \n(i)  Component  A\u2014comprising  two-thirds  of  the  credit  line  ($133.3  million)  and \ncatering to the smaller firms of the sector, e.g., cottage industries and micro \nenterprises. Under this component, 15% (i.e., $20 million) will be earmarked for \nlending to women-led SMEs. \n(ii)  Component B\u2014comprising the balance ($66.7 million), the proceeds of which \nwill be onlent by the PFIs to medium-sized enterprises. \n \n18.  Output 2: Strengthened capacity of SME entrepreneurs to access bank financing. \nThis output under the capacity development TA will support the establishment of incubation \nfacilities at educational institutions to promote entrepreneurship by (i) identifying areas (industry \nand/or sector) for  support from  incubation facilities,  (ii)  developing  a country  strategy  with \ndetailed action plans (and cost estimates) for incubation facilities, (iii) designing guidelines for \nthe selection and graduation of entrepreneurs applying for business incubation services, and \n(iv) establishing a sex-disaggregated performance monitoring system for incubation facilities. \n \n19.  Output 3: Strengthened managerial and technical capacity of small and medium-\nsized enterprise support institutions (Bangladesh Bank, SME Foundation, BSCIC) and \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2015.

This  output  of  the  TA  will  help  develop  SME  clusters  and  BSCIC  estates  by \nbolstering the backward and forward links of SMEs to the larger, more formal sectors such as \nthe export industry. Capacity development of SME support institutions will facilitate cluster \nfinancing by building up SMEs ability to form alliances and clustering, so that small firms will \ngrow and cooperate with larger firms, and by sensitizing PFI officials to promote loans to SME \nclusters and BSCIC estates. \n \n20.  Output 4: Enhanced women-led small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 access to \nbank finance and financial services. This output of the TA will boost the capacity of women \nentrepreneurs\u2019 development units at Bangladesh Bank head office and nine branches, and \ndedicated women\u2019s desks at PFIs by (i) standardizing PFI procedures, (ii) facilitating dialogue \nand cross-fertilization of practices among PFIs, and (iii) monitoring of progress in women\u2019s \naccess to and use of financial resources and services. The output will build the capacity of \nwomen entrepreneurs by supporting the development of an informal network of PFIs, women \nentrepreneurs\u2019 development units, and women\u2019s business associations with a focus on access \nto finance and good practices. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n  \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $333.3 million (Table 1). The government has requested \na loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The \nloan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as are set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreement.25 The government and the eligible PFIs are \nexpected to contribute the taka equivalent of $50 million each, while the participating SMEs are \nassumed to contribute 10% of individual subproject costs in the form of equity. 26 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment and Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ordinary capital resources)  200.0  60.0 \nGovernment (Bangladesh Bank)  50.0  15.0 \nParticipating financial institutions  50.0  15.0 \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises  33.3a  10.0 \nTotal  333.3  100.0 \na The small and medium-sized enterprise contribution of 10% is based on the assumption that SMEs \nwill contribute 10% of the individual subproject cost in the form of equity. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n22.  The Ministry of Finance, through its Bank and Financial Institutions Division, will relend \nto Bangladesh Bank the ADB loan in local currency under a subsidiary loan agreement on terms \nand  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB. The government  will  bear  the foreign  exchange  risks. \nBangladesh Bank will onlend the ADB funds, along with its own share, to eligible PFIs for \nmaking subloans to eligible subborrowers to finance eligible subprojects under a standard form \nparticipation agreement acceptable to ADB.27 \n                                                \n25 The interest will not include any maturity premium. This is based on the above loan terms and the government\u2019s \nchoice of repayment options and dates. \n26 Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions, Subprojects, and Subborrowers (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 The Bangladesh Bank rate is currently about 5% and can be considered a proxy for cost of funds in Bangladesh. \n ", "6 \n23.  Eligible PFIs will further lend the Bangladesh Bank funds under subloan agreements to \neligible subborrowers at interest rates that reflect their cost of funds plus a spread to cover \ntransaction  costs  and  risks,  reflecting  full  commercial  and  competitive  terms  at  the  PFIs\u2019 \ndiscretion.28 The maximum size for subloans under component A of the credit line will be Tk10 \nmillion,  and  Tk30  million  under  component  B.  Each  subproject  will  be  financed  with  a \nsubborrower equity contribution of 10%, a PFI debt contribution of 15%, a government debt \ncontribution of 15%, and a contribution from ADB funds of 60%, to maximize leveraging of \nresources through this project.29 Correspondingly, 16.7% of each subloan is financed by the \nPFI\u2019s funds, 16.7% of such subloan is financed by the Bangladesh Bank contribution, and \n66.6% of such subloan is financed by ADB. While the minimum term of each subloan will be set \nat 2 years, a maximum of 30% of such a subloan may be used for working capital expenditures \nof the same subborrower and must be repaid at a minimum term of 1 year.30 The minimum term \nof subloans to women entrepreneurs is 1 year.31 Subloans will only be provided to finance \nactivities not listed in ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List and will be subject to post-\nlending monitoring and review by ADB. \n \n24.  Challenge fund. Following a request from Bangladesh Bank, SMEDP2 will introduce, on \na pilot basis, a challenge fund of up to $20 million, to better align PFIs\u2019 comparative advantage \nas lenders and to catalyze funds from the finance sector into target areas.32 This will result in a \nwider range of financial products, new channels for the delivery of financial services, and \nopportunities for the most disadvantaged groups, with the ultimate goal of stimulating long-term \ninclusive, pro-poor economic growth. Potential focal areas that could be targeted under this \nconcept are (i) disadvantaged geographical regions of Bangladesh with high incidences of \npoverty, (ii) SME segments that lack access to finance, or (iii) new financial products and \nservices tailored to the needs of the target SME groups. A fund manager will oversee the \nimplementation and operationalization of the challenge fund. It is expected that a maximum of \nfive PFIs will be selected to participate. Funds not utilized by the winning PFIs within a period of \n2 years will be transferred back to the main corpus under SMEDP2. The introduction of such a \nchallenge fund would be complementary to the normal disbursement process under SMEDP2. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The Ministry of Finance, acting through its Bank and Financial Institutions Division, will \nbe the executing agency, and Bangladesh Bank will be the implementing agency.33 Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s project management unit will be the SME and Special Programs Department established \nunder SMEDP2. \n \n26.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.34 \n \n                                                \n28 ADB requires such loans to have market-based rates. ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations \nManual. OM Section D6/BP, para. 18. Manila (15 December). \n29 Each SME will be required to submit a business plan indicating that it will be able to contribute its 10% equity \nshare. \n30 The maximum term of any subloan is 5 years. \n31 As per Bangladesh Bank\u2019s policy, women entrepreneurs will receive ADB funds at interest rates of not more than \n10%. \n32 Challenge funds are not new. They made their entrance into the development landscape in the late 1990s, in early \nexperiments of providing direct support to the private sector. At least 15 challenge funds have been established by \nvarious donors in the past 15 years. \n33 SMEF will be the IA for Output B of the capacity development TA. \n34  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2016\u2013April 2020 \nEstimated completion date  30 April 2020 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering Committee  \nSecretary, Bank and Financial Institutions Division, Ministry of \nFinance (chair) \n(ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Finance\u2019s Bank and Financial Institutions Division \n(iii) Key implementing  Bangladesh Bank (for the credit line); SME Foundation (for output B \nagencies  under the proposed capacity development technical assistance) \n(iv) Implementation unit  Bangladesh Bank\u2019s SME and Special Programs Department \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time \nto time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nNote: The introduction of a recycling mechanism with a period of 10 years starting from the end of the utilization \nperiod is proposed under the Second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project. Once funds have \nbeen fully disbursed after 4 years, any reflows from SME subloans can be used again by the participating financial \ninstitutions for making fresh subloans to the SME sector for a total period of 10 years. \nSources: Asian Development Bank. \n \n27.  Bangladesh Bank has been deemed appropriate to administer the project because of its \nsubstantial  experience  in  administering  donor  projects,  its  ready  access  to  information  in \ndetermining the financial soundness and capabilities of PFIs for providing credit to the SME \nsector,  and  its  function  as  administrator  of  the  CIB,  which  gathers  information  regarding \nborrowers.35 Bangladesh  Bank\u2019s  SME  and  Special  Programs  Department,  which  has  also \nmanaged  ADB\u2019s  SMEDP1,  will  monitor  (i)  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  loans; \n(ii) exposure limits; (iii) administration of eligible disbursements against estimated PFI targets to \nSMEs  at  market  interest  rates  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  FIL  policy; and  (iv)  compliance  with \nnational policies and Bangladesh Bank's environmental and social safeguard framework, which \nensures compliance with ADB safeguard policies and national norms. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n28.  A $2 million capacity development TA, to be financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction on a grant basis and implemented over a period of 3 years, will complement the \nproject  outputs.  The  major  outputs  and  activities  of  the  TA  include  (i)  facilitating  the \nestablishment of incubation centers to promote entrepreneurship; (ii) providing assistance in the \ndevelopment  of  SME  clusters  and  BSCIC  estates  to  boost  their  capacity  to  access  bank \nfinancing  and  strengthen  the  backward  and  forward  links  of  SMEs  to  the  formal  sector, \nparticularly the larger export-driven industries; (iii) capacity building at Bangladesh Bank and the \nPFIs to ensure the effective functioning of the women entrepreneurs\u2019 development units at \nBangladesh Bank branches and dedicated women\u2019s desks at PFIs, and to educate women \n                                                \n35 A possible alternative candidate for project administration\u2014or at least part of it\u2014is SMEF, which was established \nby the Government of Bangladesh in November 2006 as part of ADB\u2019s SME Sector Development Program as an \nindependent apex body for SME promotion under the Companies Act, 1994. ADB met with SMEF on several \noccasions to discuss its credit wholesaling program, which channels funds through PFIs to SMEs and SME \nclusters in Bangladesh. SMEF is being considered as a second implementing agency for the credit line of the \nproject, for an SME cluster subcomponent of maximum $20 million under SMEDP2\u2014subject to SMEF\u2019s meeting \nADB\u2019s due diligence requirement and demonstrating its ability to implement the ADB project. If SMEF fails to meet \nADB\u2019s due diligence requirements or demonstrate its ability to implement the ADB project, then the funds \nprovisionally allocated to SMEF will be utilized under the credit line administered by Bangladesh Bank. \n ", "8 \nentrepreneurs in selected districts on financial and legal literacy; and (iv) providing support to \nBangladesh Bank to establish an administration unit for the implementation of the proposed \nchallenge  fund  under  the  SMEDP2.36 This  output  will  also  include  the  strengthening  of \nBangladesh Bank\u2019s information technology systems, so that it can carry out its monitoring and \nreporting  functions  under  SMEDP2.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  for  the  implementation \nactivities under the capacity development TA subproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The disbursements under the \ncapacity  development  TA  subproject  will  be  made  directly  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).37 The \nBank and Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency. \nThe TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years starting from March 2016. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  Significant economic benefits are expected to arise from the project since all subprojects \nfinanced under SMEDP2 will have to be economically viable. The project will help (i) improve \nthe efficiency of the medium- and long-term credit market; (ii) step up the capacity and capability \nof PFIs to provide profitable loans to viable SMEs in the country\u2019s rural areas, including some \nwomen-led companies; and (iii) help strengthen the backward and forward links of SMEs to the \nlarger, more formal sectors such as the export industry. The project is expected to have positive \nimpacts on growth, development, and employment creation, thus benefiting the private sector of \nBangladesh. Due diligence confirmed the demand for local-currency-denominated, medium- \nand long-term subloans to the targeted SMEs. PFI eligibility criteria were defined, and potential \nPFIs identified.38 Financial and integrity due diligence was completed for the top four PFIs, and \nbrief financial due diligence was carried out for the next 15 PFIs involved in SMEDP1.39  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s requirements and policies on financial management and procurement measures, \nand environmental and social safeguards were discussed and agreed with the Government of \nBangladesh  and  Bangladesh  Bank  and  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  specific \nrequirements  are  described  in  the  project  administration  manual.40 Procurement  by  the \nsubborrowers will be in accordance with established private sector or commercial practices \nacceptable to ADB, as required under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n31.  The overall financial management risk is assessed as moderate. Based on the financial \ndue diligence conducted, Bangladesh Bank needs to further strengthen its capacity and staff \nstrength,  particularly  in  the  area  of  project  administration  and  supervision.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment, including a financial analysis of the potential PFIs, indicated that \n(i) internal audit units with an independent reporting structure exist at each bank; (ii) the financial \nstatements  are  audited  by  reputable,  internationally  affiliated  audit  firms;  (iii)  formal  risk \nmanagement units exist; (iv) capital adequacy ratios are above regulatory requirements; (v) the \n                                                \n36 Output and activity (ii) will be provided by SMEF. \n37 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 Detailed due diligence has been carried out for four candidate PFIs: IDLC Finance Limited, Eastern Bank Limited, \nMicro Industries Development Assistance and Services, and Mercantile Bank Limited. \n39 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Such due diligence \nwill be completed before selection of PFIs is finalized. \n40 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nprofitability ratios are reasonable; and (vi) net interest margins are adequate. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Bank and Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project \nadministration manual (footnote 37). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  Poverty impact, gender, and social dimensions. Recognizing that high incidence of \npoverty  and  lack  of  gainful  employment  fuel  discontent  and  unrest,  the  project\u2019s  rural \ndevelopment impact contributes to stability in Bangladesh\u2019s less developed areas. The project\u2019s \npoverty impact is discussed in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.41 Potential \ngender and social impacts were reviewed. A gender assessment is reflected in the project \ndocuments and is an integral part of the project design, which is categorized thematically as \neffective gender mainstreaming.42 SMEDP2 contributes to women\u2019s empowerment by narrowing \ngender disparities through access to financial resources. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \nFI  treated  as  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples, and complies with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. The \nproject is expected to have minimal environmental impact since the subloans to SMEs will be \nmainly for light manufacturing, trade, and service activities. Similarly, the subloans will be for \nactivities that will not trigger any involuntary resettlements, nor have any impact on indigenous \npeople.  An  environmental  and  social  management  system  is  not  required  because  the \nsubproject investments carry minimal or no environmental or social risks. Bangladesh Bank has \ndeveloped environmental risk management guidelines for banks and financial institutions. These \nwere endorsed by the government on behalf of the PFIs and are mandatory regulations under \nthe  Financial  Institutions  Act,  1993.43 To  ensure  that  subprojects  comply  with  applicable \ngovernment regulations and that loan proceeds will not be used to finance activities that are on \nADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activity  list  and  are  categorized  as  FI-C  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, a subproject screening checklist will be made \nmandatory for implementation by all PFIs under SMEDP2.44 The PFIs will report on the status of \nimplementing this screening checklist to ADB through Bangladesh Bank. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The project\u2019s risks and all measures identified to reduce them were carefully analyzed \nduring preparation and appraisal. The overall project risk has been rated low because of the \nstrong record of the implementing agency in managing similar projects in the SME sector using \nADB\u2019s guidelines, the strong preparatory effort of Bangladesh Bank, and the tested design of \nthe project in successful operations under SMEDP1. The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. The major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \n(Table 3) and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.45 \n                                                \n41 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n43 Available at Bangladesh Bank. https://www.bb.org.bd/aboutus/regulationguideline/guidelist.php. \n44 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management Arrangement (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n45 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe creditworthiness of  ADB\u2019s assessment indicates that PFIs have significant opportunities for \nSMEs in some locations  lending to viable SMEs outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and \ncould affect utilization of  Chittagong. Furthermore, the anticipated improvement of the borrowing \nthe project\u2019s credit line.  capacity of SMEs through the attached capacity development technical \nassistance will indirectly help strengthen their creditworthiness. \nWeak operational and/or  A significant number of experienced PFIs have indicated strong demand for \nfinancial strength of PFIs  funding from the credit line. Operational weaknesses of some PFIs are \nbeing dealt with through (i) improved access to credit information, \n(ii) strengthened business development services and financial literacy, \n(iii) strengthened governance structures and risk management practices, \n(iv) risk-based pricing, and (v) Bangladesh Bank oversight. \nImplementation delays if  These risks have been dealt with by assessing PFI eligibility and \nthe PFIs fail to sustain  commitment upfront.

ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The government and Bangladesh Bank have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n37.  The government and Bangladesh Bank have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \nthe project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $200,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 20 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $2,000,000 to the Government of Bangladesh for the Strengthening Capacities \nof Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Stakeholders to Access Bank Financing \nand Services to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction on a grant \nbasis. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n8 December 2015 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nContinued economic growth and poverty reduction through the development of the SME sector outside \nthe  metropolitan  areas  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong  (aligned  with  the  SME  Strategy  Paper  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s forthcoming Seventh Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  and Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By end of 2019:  For all  Downturn in \nIncrease in the number  a.
