I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $30,000,000 to Nepal Water and Energy Development Company Private Limited (NWEDC) \nfor the Upper Trishuli-1 Hydropower Project in Nepal. The report also describes the proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $30,000,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for \nthe Private Sector in Asia II (CFPS II), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the CFPS II loan. \n \n2.  The loans will provide long-term financing to construct and operate a 216 megawatt (MW) \nrun-of-river hydro power plant, 70 kilometers north of the main load center Kathmandu. The \nproject will boost domestic power generation and help reduce imports of electricity into Nepal \nthrough the efficient use of indigenous renewable sources, contributing to Nepal\u2019s long-term \nenergy security, sufficiency and sustainability.1 Being the first major private sector hydropower \ninvestment  with  long-term  international financing from  various  development  institutions, the \nproject is expected to be a landmark transaction and will have a significant demonstration effect \nfor private sector participation in Nepal\u2019s energy sector. Furthermore, the project has incorporated \nseveral design features and targets to improve access to social services, economic and financial \nresources and basic rural infrastructure for women in communities near the project.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Nepal has suffered from a severe shortage of power and frequent \nload shedding. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, annual peak demand in Nepal was estimated to be 1,508 \nMW but, installed generation capacity was only 1,074 MW.2 The total electricity available during \nFY2018 was 7,058 gigawatt-hour (GWh), of which about one-third each was supplied by Nepal \nElectricity Authority (NEA), independent power producers (IPPs) and India. In FY2018, power \nimported from India totaled 2,581 GWh, an increase of 19% on FY2017. More recently, during the \nmonth of March 2019, more than 50% of daily peak demand was being met by imported electricity.3 \nWhile installed power generation capacity has grown steadily, from 706 MW in FY2011 to 1,074 \nMW in FY2018, or by an annual average of 5.4%, peak power demand during the same period \ngrew even faster, by an annual average of 7.2%, widening the supply\u2013demand gap. This gap has \nbeen partially bridged by imports from India of up to 450 MW. The remaining deficit resulted in \nregular load shedding. \n \n4.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n5.  The project is in a remote area with high socio-economic vulnerabilities, which were further \nexacerbated after the 2015 earthquake.4 Not only was physical and social infrastructure damaged \nin the 10 project area villages but, there was severe impact on the livelihood (agriculture), housing \nand living conditions of people, with at least 2 villages completely destroyed. Male outmigration \nto work as plantation and security workers is a common livelihood preference, leaving women in \ncharge  of  many  households.  Female  literacy  rate  is  lower  (47%)  as  compared  with  male \n                                                \n1  Government of Nepal. Water and Energy Commission Secretariat. 2013.

(accessed 11 March 2019). \n4  The total population of the 3 affected village development councils is approximately 7,000 with sex ratio of 989 \nfemales per 1,000 males. \n \n ", "2 \ncounterparts (61%). Less than 10% of women have legal ownership of land and assets.5 \nEmployment opportunities for women are extremely limited, and if they work, it is physical hard \nlabor, often on low wages, and with no social security benefits. Inadequate water and electricity \ninfrastructure and health care facilities lead to additional hardship, poor health, and hygiene for \nwomen. Instances of girl trafficking have also been reported in this area. Following ADB\u2019s Policy \non Gender and Development (1998), NWEDC has incorporated several design features and \ntargets to improve access to better education and health care facilities, economic and financial \nresources  and  basic  rural  infrastructure  for  women  in  communities  near  the  project.  The \ninvestment is proposed to be categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n6.  Project  design.  The  project  comprises  the  design,  construction,  commissioning, \noperation and maintenance of a 216 MW run-of-river hydro power plant, 1.2 kilometers of \ntransmission lines, and associated infrastructure on the Trishuli River. Main project components \nare a diversion weir, headrace and tailrace tunnels, vertical shaft, powerhouse, transformer yard, \nand switchgear. Daelim and Kyeryong are engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) \ncontractors and responsible for the construction of the project.  \n \n7.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n8.

Impacts. The project contributes to Nepal\u2019s energy security, sufficiency and sustainability \nby 2030 through the efficient use of indigenous energy resources;6 and will contribute to meeting \nthe target of increasing hydropower generation capacity by 12,000 MW by 2030.7 \n \n16.  Outcome. The project outcome is the generation of 1,282 GWh of clean electricity \nannually to be dispatched to the national grid, and avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions equal \nto 446,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year of operation.8 There will be at least 65 jobs created \nduring the operations phase, of which 10 will be for women. The annual domestic purchase of \ngoods and services is expected to amount to more than $3.3 million during the operations phase. \n \n17.  Outputs. The outputs will be (i) 216 MW of hydropower capacity and 1.2 km of 220 kilovolt \ntransmission lines developed and installed by the private sector, (ii) local employment generated \nby the construction of the project, (iii) economic opportunities for women improved, (iv) growth of \nthe local economy supported, and (v) awareness with respect to gender-based violence raised. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 outlines \nseven operational priorities to meet the development challenges in Asia and the Pacific today.9  \nThe project supports two of them: (i) fighting remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; and (ii) \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability. Under Strategy 2030, ADB will expand and broaden its support to the private sector \nfor building critical infrastructure with strong development impacts and the project supports this. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013-2017 for Nepal aims to help the country achieve \nhigh and inclusive economic growth through higher capital investment, in among other areas, \nenergy and transport infrastructure. The strategy calls for an increase in electricity generation to \nhelp energy security.10 The project increases electricity generation in the country and thus \ncontributes to energy security, which is consistent with this country strategy. \n \n20.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which encourages interventions that promote use of renewable energy \nto slow down the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and help countries achieve energy self-\nsufficiency.11 \n \n21.  Lessons from previous operations.  The design of the project took careful consideration \nof the experience with other hydropower projects implemented in Asia. Lessons from a successful \npublic-private  partnership  project  in  hydropower  development  identified  the  involvement  of \ndevelopers with the requisite technical experience and adequate financial resources as one of \n                                                \n6  Government of Nepal.

The assistance consists of: (i) a loan of up to $30 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources; and (ii) a concessional loan from the CFPS II of up to $30 million, administered by \nADB. [Confidential information deleted.] NWEDC will be bound by commercial terms, and financial \nand operational covenants stipulated in the financing agreements. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s involvement is critical because long-term financing for private sector hydropower \ngeneration projects is not available in Nepal. The project\u2019s sustainability depends on its ability to \namortize the high up-front capital costs over a long period. The repayment profiles of the ADB \nand the CFPS II loans help make the project financially viable. Being the first major private sector \nhydropower generation investment with international financing, the project is expected to be a \nlandmark  transaction  for  IPP  development  and  ADB\u2019s  participation.  After  several  years  of \nprotracted efforts, the project will have a significant demonstration effect for private sector \nparticipation in major hydropower generation IPPs and other projects in Nepal\u2019s energy sector. \nThe project also benefits from ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and IFC performance standards \n(land acquisition and livelihood restoration plan) and will adopt international best practices in \nsafeguards management of hydropower projects establishing sustainable benchmarks for the \nmanagement  of  cumulative  impacts,  impact  on  habitat  and  benefit  sharing  with  affected \ncommunities. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s participation helps to avoid, manage and mitigate negative \nsocial and environmental impacts and introduces additional measures to promote gender equity. \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2002.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) (the SPS) as follows: environment (category A),16 involuntary resettlement \n(category A), and indigenous people (category A); and as highly complex and sensitive. ADB has \nundertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts of the \nproject and measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate and compensate for the adverse impacts were \nincorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  An  independent  and  qualified  consultant \nprepared a detailed environment and social impact assessment report for the project.17 \n \n35.  Environment. Key environmental impacts include (i) permanent loss of circa (c.) 2.61 \nhectares (ha) of natural habitat and temporary use of 4.16 ha of modified habitat for the workers\u2019 \ncamp in the Langtang National Park buffer zone; (ii) reduced downstream flows and alteration of \naquatic  habitat  in  the  dewatered  stretch  of  the  Trishuli  river  (about  10.7  kilometers);  (iii) \noccupational, public health, and safety risks and impacts during construction and operation; and \n(iv) project contributions to cumulative impacts in the Trishuli River basin. The climate change risk \nassessment concluded that the risks of climate change for the project are low. The project design \nincludes a fish ladder to minimize the impact on the migration of common snow trout (Schizothorax \nrichardsonii), a vulnerable fish species. The environmental flow and connectivity assessment \nconcluded that 10% of the mean monthly flow would be adequate to maintain the aquatic habitat \nand connectivity within the diversion reach. The environmental and social assessment report \nindicates that the project area is not a critical habitat for any species. The environment and social \nmanagement and mitigation includes framework plans for dealing with all the project impacts, \nincluding a biodiversity management plan and offsets to demonstrate \u2018no net loss\u2019.18 \n \n36.  NWEDC has a team of qualified experts, supported by consultants, to manage the \nenvironmental and social risks and impacts of the project. This institutional capacity will be further \nstrengthened, by adding qualified resources, to ensure that management plans are implemented \nto meet lenders\u2019 requirements. NWEDC is about to engage an independent advisory panel for \nproject preparation and implementation phases. The company will also submit quarterly third-\n                                                \n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n17 Nepal Water and Energy Development Company Private Limited.

Social safeguards. The project footprint is spread across 10 villages in the three former \nvillage development councils of Kaku, Dhunche and Ramache. A total of about 109 ha of land is \nrequired for the project on a permanent (c. 31.29 ha) or temporary basis (c. 77.7 ha). Of these \nabout 85 ha are government owned and the rest is a mix of private (c. 8 ha) and \u2018guthi\u2019 land \n(monastery-owned land farmed by local tenants, c. 16 ha). Land acquisition for the project \naffected 38 land plots and 36 structures (both permanent and temporary) resulting in impacts on \n154 families. Of the affected structures which have been, or will be, impacted, 10 represent \nprimary residences, the others are agricultural buildings, temporary residences used during \ncropping season, water mills or storage buildings. The government and forest lands used by the \nproject and its ancillary facilities such as the transmission line, impact six community forest user \ngroups. Stakeholder consultations indicate that individual dependence on the community forest \nwas limited in nature. Most of these lands were acquired in 2012-2013 and a further 8 ha was \npurchased in 2018 to establish safe worker camps in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake. \n \n38.   A land acquisition and livelihood restoration plan (LALRP) in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  and  IFC  performance  standards  was  developed  and  is  being \nimplemented to avoid, manage and mitigate impacts resulting from land acquisition for the project. \nThe LALRP: (i) describes the land acquisition and compensation process; (ii) identifies gaps with \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement; and (iii) outlines corresponding mitigation measures that include \na comprehensive livelihood restoration package for affected households. The LALRP reflects the \nresults of past and continuing engagement with affected families and communities in relation to \nland acquisition, compensation and physical displacement arrangements. The LALRP will be \nupdated and re-disclosed based on the final alignment of the transmission line. \n \n39.  Establishing the Upper Trishuli-1 hydropower plant results in direct impacts on the land \nand natural resources of 154 families, of whom, ethnically, more than 90 % are Tamang and less \nthan  5%  are  Gurung.  Both  ethnicities  are  recognized  under  the  Constitution  of  Nepal  as \nindigenous nationalities, or Adivasi Janajati. Project impacts on indigenous people include the \nacquisition of community forest user group land and water resources for commercial development \nand the limited relocation of indigenous people families, both of which trigger broad community \nsupport (BCS) under the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n40.  A project-specific BCS process was assessed and documented in line with the Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  Nepal  Federation  of  Indigenous  Nationalities,  Nepal\u2019s  preeminent \nindigenous peoples\u2019 organization, and an international indigenous peoples\u2019 expert were engaged \nto facilitate the BCS process on behalf of the sponsors. They mobilized the federation\u2019s Tamang \nspeaking national and district chapters to work with affected communities during the BCS process, \nwith the explicit aim of facilitating meaningful and informed consultations and collective decision-\nmaking. The BCS process and outcome, as captured in the indigenous peoples plan provided \nevidence  (including  explicit  references  in  the  signed  consent  agreement)  that  (i)  affected \ncommunities believe that the process was conducted in a transparent manner and with disclosure \nof relevant information; (ii) meaningful consultations were held with affected communities; (iii) \nrecommendations from these consultations were integrated in planning and implementation; and \n(iv) good faith negotiation between these communities formed the basis on which NWEDC and \nthe  indigenous  communities  arrived  at  a  formal  consent  agreement.  ADB  staff  met  with \nrepresentatives of affected communities on multiple occasions between 2014 and 2018, most \nrecently during the final round of BCS and consent agreement discussions between indigenous \ngroups and the company. \n \n ", "7 \n \n41.  Gender.  The  investment  is  proposed  to  be  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.
