Assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to international agricultural research \nspans  almost  30  years.    From  1975  to  1995,  ADB\u2019s  support  for  agricultural  research  was \nchanneled largely through individual grants to specific centers for specific purposes, ranging from \nimproving training facilities to establishing regional collaborative networks. In 1995 the Board \napproved the Agriculture and Natural Resources Research (ANRR)  Policy Paper.  Since 1996 \nADB has supported ANRR through an annual regional technical assistance (RETA), and has \nprovided  $38.8  million  of  assistance  to  the  Consultative  Group  on  International  Agricultural \nResearch (CGIAR) and non-CGIAR Centers. ADB's policy on ANRR addresses three strategic \nobjectives: sustainable management of natural resources, increases in agricultural productivity, \nand poverty reduction.  \n \n2.  In the past three decades, the international agricultural research centers (IARCs) have \ndelivered higher-yielding food crops; more productive livestock, fish, and trees; environmentally \nfriendly farming systems; better policies; enhanced scientific capacities in developing countries; \nand many dividends to poor farmers through better resource use, increased output, and greater \nincome. The CGIAR, established in 1971, is an association of 15 IARCs working in more than 100 \ndeveloping countries to mobilize cutting-edge science to achieve sustainable food security, to \nprotect the environment, and to reduce poverty. The CGIAR research agenda is focused on both \nstrategic and applied research, and includes the entire range of problems that affect agricultural \nproductivity such as sustainable management of natural resources and protection of biodiversity. \nAppendix 1 summarizes ADB-assisted agricultural research projects funded through the CGIAR \nand non-CGIAR centers.   \n \n3.  In December 2000, ADB reviewed the 1995  ANRR policy and evaluated the experience \nand impact  of  its IARC funding.1 Based on the evaluation, ADB recommended  continued  support \nto the IARCs based on high return on investments, relevance of  the policy  and research outputs \nof supported projects, and overall effectiveness of the annual RETA modality. In April 2003, the \nAgriculture,  Natural  Resources  and  Social  Sectors  Division,  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  (RSAN)    prepared  a  comprehensive  Guidelines  on  Submission  of \nProject Proposals (2003) for the annual RETA on ANRR. It specifies ADB\u2019s required format for \nproject preparation, participation and ownership of the countries concerned, and alignment of \nproposals within country priorities.   \n \n4.  Following  the  Guidelines,  the  Agriculture,  Natural  Resources  and  Rural  Development \n(ANRRD) Committee met on 12 March 2004 to review in detail the concept notes received for \nconsideration  under  the  Ninth  RETA  on  ANRR.  The  committee  selected  a  prioritized  list  of \nproposals for consideration during the Project Approval Committee (PAC) meeting on 16 March \n2004.    PAC  comprises  the  regional  directors    of  the  agriculture,  environment,  and  natural \nresources divisions2 and is chaired by the RSAN director. PAC discussed the merits of each \nproposal  and  selected  seven  for  expansion  to  full  technical  proposals.  ANRRD  Committee \nmembers  received and  conducted  a technical evaluation of the revised proposals during a \nsecond  meeting  on  15  June  2004.  The  Committee  assessed  the  quality  and  content  of  the \nproposals and short-listed proposals that best demonstrated innovation, relevance, and synergy \nwith  ADB  operations,  as  well  as  potential  impact  on  poverty.  The  shortlist  of  proposals  was \nfinalized and endorsed to PAC  for  its consideration and final selection.  The PAC discussed each  \n \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2000.

", "2  \nof the prioritized proposals and selected five projects to support under the Ninth RETA. These \nprojects are expected to substantially contribute to ADB\u2019s programs in the respective regions.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Results of agricultural research benefit the livelihoods of millions throughout the Asia and \nPacific region, particularly the poor, mainly through: (i) raising farm income and employment; (ii) \nlowering food prices in the market; (iii) providing more means for better education, health, and \nhousehold services; and (iv) promoting broad-based economic growth. But agricultural research \nfaces several major challenges.  \n \n6.  Increasing pressure to meet food demand and quality In Asia and the Pacific. Yearly, \n76 million people are added to the world\u2019s population, which is now 6.2 billion. By 2050, population \nis expected to increase by almost 50%, reaching 9 billion (estimates of the United Nations Food \nand  Agriculture  Organization).  The  Asia  and  Pacific  region  is  experiencing  an  even  higher \npopulation growth rate, plus greater urbanization and faster per capita consumption. Those factors \nsignificantly increase food demand in the region. But productivity of much of the region\u2019s arable \nland  is  declining  because  of  shrinking  water  supplies  and  deteriorating  land  quality.  It  is \nincreasingly recognized that only a continuous stream of yield-enhancing technologies can boost \nfood production and avert possible food shortages. Improved food quality has also become an \nessential requirement of modern society. Through partnerships among IARCs, the private sector, \nand the national agricultural research systems (NARS), small farmers will have access to a range \nof promising technologies to stabilize and increase yields, and improve food quality.  \n \n7.  Need for new breakthroughs in cutting-edge science. There is a constant need to \ndevelop new technologies for higher yields, and more drought-resistant varieties, to significantly \nboost food production in the region. But breakthroughs in agricultural research have been fewer in \nrecent years, mainly because of the lack of effective national research policies, inadequate focus \non key and strategic research areas, and increasing funding constraints. Funding for agricultural \nresearch by national governments and international donors has continuously declined in the past \nseveral years. A need is emerging to increase focus on high-priority and strategic research to \naccelerate  breakthroughs  in  agricultural  and  food  technologies.  The  international  community \nshould increase its efforts to mobilize the resources necessary to achieve these goals.  \n \n8.  Inadequate capacity for networking and dissemination of research results to NARS. \nMany  valuable  research  results  are  not  made  readily  available  to  NARS  for  further  adaptive \nresearch  because  of  inadequate  networking,  funds,  and  facilities.  Networking  is an  important \naspect of ANRR; it allows research staff easier access to germplasm, research techniques, and \nliterature  under  the  guidance  of  IARC  scientists.  In  recent  years,  IARCs  have  focused  on \nnetworking among the developing member countries (DMCs) and on strengthening their efforts to \ndisseminate research results to NARSs for eventual adoption by farmers.  \n \n9.  Lessons Learned. The design of the proposed RETA incorporated several key lessons \nfrom past research projects funded by ADB. These include the need for greater emphasis on (i) \nstrengthening  NARS  capacities;  (ii)  improving  linkages  among  researchers,  practitioners,  and \npolicymakers to better disseminate research results; and (iii) increasing the focus of research \nthemes on issues related to resource-poor farmers. \n \nIII.  PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The proposed RETA is consistent with ADB\u2019s policy on ANRR and fully meets its three \nstrategic  objectives  of  sustainable  management  of  natural  resources,  increased  agricultural ", "      3\nproductivity,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  proposed  RETA  also  reinforces  the  priorities  and \napproaches outlined in ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework3 and the poverty reduction strategy.4 \nThe proposed RETA will be the ninth umbrella RETA for ANRR at IARCs, and will contribute to the \nefforts of 14 ADB member countries. \n \n11.  The overall RETA objectives are to reduce rural poverty, improve farmers\u2019 livelihoods, and \npromote resource conservation through enhanced agricultural research and dissemination in the \nAsia and Pacific region. The specific RETA objectives are to \n(i)  reduce post-harvest losses of vegetable production by developing more efficient and \nlower-cost technologies for the Mekong region; \n(ii)  improve and stabilize maize yields and production by developing and disseminating \nnew technologies for stress-tolerant, high-yielding maize varieties for the East and \nSoutheast Asia regions; \n(iii)  improve productivity and yields of staple crops by developing and disseminating \nresource-efficient technologies for rice-wheat systems and enhancing crop quality \nand diversification in South Asia; and \n(iv)  address  water  shortages,  land  degradation,  and  decreasing  crop  yields  by \npromoting community-based innovations termed bright spots, and developing new \nfarming practices more tolerant to soil salinity, sodicity, and waterlogging for Central \nAsia.  \n \n12.  The key RETA outputs are: (i) new postharvest technologies for vegetables, stress-tolerant \nand high-yielding maize varieties, enhanced rice-wheat systems, and new farming practices for \nimproved management of salinized land and water; (ii) dissemination of the new technologies; (iii) \nenhanced capacities of international and national agricultural research systems; and (iii) improved \ncoordination among NARS and IARCs in the Asia and the Pacific region. Appendix 2 gives the \nRETA framework. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The  proposed  RETA  will  support  the  development,  application,  and  dissemination  of \nscientific research on problems that farmers in the region face through five stand-alone projects. All \nfive projects address the strategic agenda of the ANRR policy, have been identified in close \nconsultation  with  participating  DMCs,  and  will  be  implemented  independently  by  four  IARCs: \nAVRDC \u2013 The World Vegetable Center (formerly the Asian Vegetable Research and Development \nCentre), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), the International Rice \nResearch Institute (IRRI), and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), and ADB. The \nsynopses of the projects are in paras. 14\u201318. Appendixes 3\u20137 give detailed project descriptions, \nincluding project frameworks. \n \n14.  Improving Rural Livelihoods Through Development of Vegetable-Based Postharvest \nTechnologies. The Project will assess the current status of postharvest technologies, including \npriority  needs  and  key  strategies  for  their  improvement,  and  identify  high-yielding  vegetable \nvarieties  for  processing  and  shipping.  The  Project  will  also  develop,  test,  and  disseminate \ninnovative  low-cost  postharvest  technologies,  using  traditional  methods  and  locally  available \nmaterials.  The  Project  will  collect  and  disseminate  information  on  markets,  and  postharvest \nproblems and opportunities.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001.

Improving Farmers\u2019 Incomes Through Enhanced Maize Production Technologies in \nDrought-Prone Environments in East and Southeast Asia. The Project will (i) develop and test \nresource-efficient technologies to increase maize productivity in drought-prone environments, and \nto minimize adverse environmental effects; (ii) strengthen the capacity of national agricultural \nresearch  and  extension  systems  (NARES)  and  other  key  stakeholders  to  participate  in  the \ndevelopment and dissemination of integrated technologies for crop and resource management; (iii) \nassess  farmers\u2019  acceptance  of  new  technologies,  and  their  sustainability;  and  (iv)  sensitize \ndecision makers to develop policies that enable wider technology dissemination. The Project will \naim to strengthen the links between molecular and field-based breeding approaches, and among \nactivities for breeding, technology verification, and dissemination.  \n \n16.  Enhancing Farmers\u2019 Incomes and Livelihoods through Integrated Crop and Resource \nManagement in the Rice-Wheat System in South Asia. The Project will develop, test, and \ndisseminate resource-efficient technologies for rice-wheat systems, enhance capacities of national \nand international agricultural research organizations, improve crop quality and diversification, and \npromote private sector participation in production and post-production management. The Project \nwill build on lessons learned under RETA 5945, and will develop a strategy to replicate successful \ntechnologies for scaling up and multiplication of benefits at new target sites. \n \n17.  Enabling Communities in the Aral Sea Basin to Combat Land and Water Resource \nDegradation  through  Creation  of  Bright  Spots.  The  Project  will  promote  increased  land \nproductivity and water use efficiency, and reverse soil degradation in Central Asia by identifying \nand replicating community-based innovations termed bright spots. The research activity will also \ninvolve field-testing and verification of the efficacy and management options for the cultivation of \ncrop and forage species that can tolerate ambient levels of soil salinity, sodicity, and waterlogging. \nIrrigation  management  strategies  and  socioeconomic  environments  will  be  assessed \ncomprehensively.  Project  outcomes  will  be  disseminated  partly  through  on-farm  testing  of \npromising technologies and annual field days.  \n \n18.  Workshops for Strengthening Partnerships for More Effective Planning, Research, \nand Development in Agriculture in the Mekong Region and Southeast Asia. The Project will \nfacilitate two interactive regional forums on strengthening partnerships in the Mekong Region and \nSoutheast  Asia  to  enhance  linkages  among  IARCs,  national  planning  agencies,  farmer \nrepresentatives, and other stakeholders. The purpose is to optimize resource use, make research \nmore demand-driven, and make results more accessible. ADB will take the lead in planning and \norganizing the workshops, in consultation with concerned regional departments.5  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The estimated cost of the RETA is $6.96 million equivalent (Appendix 8). ADB will finance \n$3.0 million (43%of the total cost) on a grant basis from its TA funding program. The sponsoring \nIARCs will finance $2.71 million equivalent (39%) from their core budgets. The participating NARS \nwill contribute $1.25 million equivalent (18%).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA will follow the implementation arrangements used in previous ADB research TAs, \nwhose modalites have been proven. ADB will enter into separate TA agreements with each IARC. \n                                                 \n5  This initiative is a part of ADB\u2019s effort to strengthen partnerships among research organizations, practitioners, and \npolicymakers in Asia. In 2004, under ADB\u2019s Eighth RETA on ANRR, two similar regional workshops were held in \nCentral and South Asia. After completion of this TA, the experiences of all four Asian subregions are expected to be \nsynthesized. ", "      5\nEach EA will be responsible for implementing and completing its own project.6 The 21 participating \nNARS will be designated as the Implementing Agencies (IAs), and will collaborate closely with the \nconcerned IARCs. Participating NARS have sent letters of commitment to this effect. Each EA will \nappoint a project coordinator and team leader who will coordinate, plan, and supervise all local \nproject  activities;  monitor  project  progress;  and  submit  required  reports  to  ADB  and  other \ncollaborating  partners.  Similarly,  each  IA  will  appoint  a  national  team  leader  who  will  be \nresponsible for coordination, implementation, and reporting on the Project. RSAN will implement \nthe coordination workshops for Mekong and Southeast Asia, assisted by two international and one \ndomestic consultants. \n \n21.  Each project is expected to begin in January 2005 and be implemented over 3 years, i.e., \nup to December 2007. Each project will hold inception workshops within 3 months after it starts to \nfirm up project plans and implementation arrangements with partners. Each EA will also organize \nannual  planning  and  review  meetings  and  a  project  completion  workshop  which  all  project \npartners, including ADB, will attend. Each IARC must submit the following reports to ADB: (i) \ninception reports, (ii) semiannual progress reports, (iii) semiannual financial statements accounting \nfor the use of project funds, (iv) audited annual financial statements, and (v) a comprehensive \ncompletion report. The inception reports will be submitted within 3 months of the start of each \nproject;  the  semiannual  progress  reports  and  financial  statements  every  6  months;  and  the \ncomprehensive completion report, within 3 months of project closure. Funds will be drawn down in \nsemiannual installments based on each IARC\u2019s estimate of forthcoming expenditures, and subject \nto  satisfactory  liquidation  of  expenditures  for  previously  disbursed funds.  Project  officers  with \nsuitable technical expertise will be assigned to administer the projects at ADB, and will undertake \nat least one supervisory mission yearly to each project. The office of the director of RSAN, in close \nconsultation with the offices of the five regional directors for agriculture, environment, and natural \nresources,7  will  be  responsible  for  overall  administration  of  the  proposed  umbrella  RETA, \nmaintenance of accounts, and preparation of status reports. \n \n22.  All participating IARCs will procure goods and services according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  At  the  end  of  the  TA,  equipment  purchased  will  be  assigned  to  the  EA/IAs \nconcerned. The IARCs and ADB will engage specialists on an individual basis, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB, based \non biodata proposals. Before engaging consultants, IARCs will submit their curricula vitae to ADB \nfor approval.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis for the Ninth Agriculture and Natural \nResources Research at International Agricultural Research Centers. \n                                                 \n6  AVRDC, through its office in Tainan, Taipei,China, will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project on Improving \nFarmers\u2019 Income Through Enhanced Maize Productivities In Drought-Prone Environments In East And Southeast Asia. \nCIMMYT, through its regional office in Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines, will be the EA for Improving Farmers\u2019 Income Through \nEnhanced Maize Productivities In Drought-Prone Environments In East And Southeast Asia.

Introduction \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will support implementation of research and \ndevelopment activities that will increase productivity and profitability in the vegetable supply \nchain  in  three  Southeast  Asian  countries.  The  Program  will  identify  constraints  in  the \npostharvest sector, then address the constraints through development of improved technologies \nand training of the national agriculture research system (NARS) staff, processors, and farmers. \nThe  proposed  program  targets  the  hot-wet  environments  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  Viet  Nam  (collectively  referred  to  as  CLV),  where \nvegetable farmers and other agents in the supply chain risk high postharvest losses. \n \n2.  Postharvest losses severely constrain vegetable production levels and revenues in the \nCLV region. Viet Nam suffered a $15 million decrease in export revenues from vegetables and \nfruits during the first quarter of 2004 compared with the first quarter of 2003. The decrease was \nattributed to inadequate post-harvest technologies.1 Improvement of postharvest handling and \nstorage of horticultural crops has become a priority in all three countries. A stakeholder meeting \nat AVRDC\u2014the World Vegetable Center\u2014in 2001 with representatives from the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region identified postharvest technologies as one of the most \nneeded areas for research and development, especially for the hot-wet ecologies.2  \n \n3.  The proposed project reflects increasing awareness of vegetable production by many \nAsian  NARS  and  governments.  Within  the  CLV  Network  (CLVNET),  a  regional  vegetable \nnetwork funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), national programs have been active in \ncountry-specific and regional research to identify disease-resistant vegetable varieties. Some of \nthe selected varieties have excellent postharvest quality traits. The proposed project will build \nupon  strong  regional  interests  and  successes  of  ongoing  research  and  training  activities. \nConducting postharvest related research will give farmers of the region an opportunity to benefit \nfrom increasing global consumer demand for vegetables, and to participate in international and \ninterregional trade.  \n \nB.  Issues and Constraints \n4.  Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, within the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), \ncontinue  to  rely  heavily  on  agriculture.  In  all  three  countries  the  agricultural  sector  is \ncharacterized  by  a  rice-based  cropping  system,  suffering  from  low  agrodiversity  and \nproductivity. Poverty, unemployment, and malnourishment are widespread. AVRDC studies in \nthe three countries show that vegetable production provides higher profits and more jobs per \nhectare than rice production.3 Vegetable production supports agribusiness and related service \n                                                 \n1  Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Press News. 8 April 2004.

Also, vegetable \nproduction develops management and leadership skills among farmers. A strong vegetable \nsector leads to economic growth and promotes rural sustainability.  \n \n5.  Vegetable production  in  the  CLV  region  can be  highly  profitable,  but  it  is  severely \nconstrained by postharvest losses that reduce profits for farmers and marketers. Information is \nlimited, but indicates that postharvest losses can be as high as 60% for cabbage and tomato, \n50% for head lettuce and cauliflower, 30% for bell pepper, and 17% for Chinese cabbage.5 The \nvalue of vegetable production in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam is about $1 billion \nannually (footnote 2). Given that most vegetables are perishable and assuming a conservative \nestimate of an average 30% postharvest loss, the losses are about $300 million annually. Thus, \nreducing  postharvest  losses  will  help  raise  farmers\u2019  incomes  and  make  diversification  into \nvegetable production less risky and more attractive. \n \n6.  Postharvest losses reduce opportunities for exports and export revenues. International \ntrade is growing fast because of trade liberalization and market reforms. Also, interregional \ntrade within the GMS is expanding. Participation in international markets requires relatively \nsophisticated networks for marketing, information, and transportation. Successful competition \nrequires quality control and product standardization.6  \n \n7.  Specific information on vegetable postharvest losses, storage infrastructure, and trade is \nnot currently available in individual GMS countries. To understand the dynamics of the harvest-\nto-consumption chain, it is essential that this information is collected and made available. The \nCLV countries have identified this as an issue of great importance.7 Farmers and processors \nneed access to new information sources to produce for rapidly changing markets.  \n \n8.  Even for relatively unprocessed forms of food such as fresh vegetables, value-added \nprocessing  after  harvest  makes  up  around  80%  of  the  products\u2019  final  value.8  Postharvest \nactivities such as processing and marketing provide employment,9 which is crucially important in \nCLV. Postharvest activities tend to benefit women because they traditionally play an important \nrole in the processing, handling, and preparation of foods. Often, their heavy involvement in the \ninformal  sector  allows  women  to  move  into  the  formal  sector.10  Facilitation  of  postharvest \nindustries can, therefore, contribute to greater gender equality and empowerment of women. \n \n9.  Transformation of the unproductive and subsistence agriculture prevalent in the three \ncountries into more efficient and profitable commercialized agriculture is essential. Also, off-farm \n                                                 \n4  Weinberger, K. and C. Genova. Forthcoming.

Rationale \n10.  Vegetable production in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam is characterized by high \npostharvest  losses  (20\u201360%)  that  reduce  profits  of  farmers  and  marketers.  Constraints  to \nvegetable  production  include  the  lack  of  varieties  suitable  for  processing  and  shipping, \ninadequate  marketing  information  and  skills,  poor  handling  and  storage  technologies,  and \nundeveloped  processing  industries.  Cambodia  has  recently  started  to  enhance  the \ndiversification  and  commercialization  of  its  agricultural  sector  by  improving  its  facilities  for \npostharvest  handling,  storage,  and  processing,  and  by  developing  agricultural  quality \nstandards.11 Similarly, Viet Nam plans to expand production of high-quality vegetables and to \ntransfer small-scale processing equipment to small-scale farmers.12  \n \n11.  Improving  pre-harvest  processing  technologies  and  promoting  postharvest \nmicroenterprises  will  stimulate  employment,  enhance  rural  economic  development,  and \nstimulate  economic  growth  and  sustainability  across  the  three  countries.  Improving  the \npostharvest vegetable sector will result in sustained year-round availability of vegetables and \nvegetable-based products. Promoting the postharvest food chain will encourage private sector \nparticipation in GMS countries, which will further enhance the vegetable supply. This will also \nfacilitate economic cooperation, improved marketing systems, and human capacity building. \n \n12.  Information exchange among GMS countries is extremely important, and was discussed \nat length during the second meeting of the Working Group on Agriculture of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Economic Cooperation Program. Initial collaborative training for food processing is \nalready  underway.  Cross-border  collaborative  training  in  fruit  and  vegetable  processing, \nhowever, is limited. Experience shows that after training, reliable supplies of high-quality food \nproducts become available and agroprocessors and exporters significantly expand their shares \nin regional and international markets for processed food products.13  \n \n13.   Value to Related ADB Projects and Strategies. ADB\u2019s country strategies14 for all \nthree countries have identified the development of small and medium enterprises as crucial for \nreduction of rural poverty. ADB recognizes that the agricultural sector must move more strongly \nfrom subsistence to commercial production, focusing on value-added products. The proposed \nproject is oriented to these considerations and focuses activities on the rural poor and on \npromoting postharvest technologies and enterprises to diversify the rural economy.  \n \n14.  Former Activities Related to this Project. A vegetable research and development \nnetwork (CLVNET) was established in 1994 by AVRDC, through ADB financial support.

By 2003, AVRDC had distributed 11,116 seed samples of major vegetable \ncrops to research and development (R&D) specialists in the subregion. Through CLVNET, both \nCambodia and the Lao PDR identified the AVRDC tomato variety CLN1462A as promising, and \nworthy of extensive on-farm testing. CLN1462A is an open-pollinated variety, resistant to many \ndiseases  of  the  region  (bacterial  wilt,  tomato  mosaic  virus,  gray  leaf  spot,  and  race  1  of \nFusarium wilt), and produces a firm fruit. It is believed that CL1462A will have lower postharvest \nlosses, and a longer shelf life, than local tomato varieties.  \n \n15.  Additional  Activities  Related  to  This  Project.  AVRDC  is  currently  initializing \npostharvest research in Cambodia through a collaborative research project with the Australian \nCenter for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) to evaluate the effectiveness of low-cost \npostharvest technologies on quality of tomatoes and chilis. AVRDC\u2019s tomato breeding program \nis now releasing high-quality tomato varieties that are suitable for processing and shipping. \nOther  activities  that  complement  the  proposed  project  will  be  tapped  for  knowledge \ndissemination and skills enhancement, such as the Swiss Development Cooperation-funded \nHuman Resource Development Project, which will be implemented for 4 years (until 31 March \n2007), focusing on human capacity building in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. More \nthan 600 extension specialists and lead farmers are trained through this program annually. The \nAVRDC-Asian Regional Center in Bangkok, Thailand, will support training needs of farmers and \nNARS personnel. \n \n16.  AVRDC, with its long-term involvement in developing the vegetable production sectors \nand longstanding collaboration with Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, is well-suited to \nimplement the Project. AVRDC has successfully established CLVNET, which is geared for \nvegetable research. Postharvest research will add value to ongoing activities, and generate new \neconomic opportunities in the region.  \n \n2.  Purpose and Output \n17.  The Project\u2019s long-term goal is to reduce poverty, enhance rural economic development, \nand  improve  food  security  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  by  promoting  the \nvegetable postharvest sector. Specific purposes of the Project are to:  \n(i)  reduce postharvest losses of high volume, high value vegetable commodities, \nand  \n(ii)  develop and promote low-cost, postharvest technologies in collaboration with \nboth public and private sectors \n \n18.  The expected outputs are: \n(i)  Output 1. An in-depth assessment of the vegetable supply chain in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, and Viet Nam; \n(ii)  Output 2. High-yielding varieties of popular vegetables with improved shipping \nand processing qualities selected and made available;  \n(iii)  Output  3.  Training,  capacity  building,  and  information  dissemination  in \npostharvest handling and processing; and \n(iv)  Output 4. Strengthened partnerships among CLV countries. \n \n19.

Methodology and Key Activities \n20.  A planning workshop will be held early in project implementation to define details of the \nwork program and ensure coordinated implementation of activities among the GMS partners. \nThe assessment of postharvest priorities, with the help of a postharvest consultant, will be \nfollowed by identification of suitable postharvest technologies for a prioritized set of vegetables. \nA  detailed  monitoring  program  will  be  developed  simultaneously.  Annual  performance \nmonitoring and planning workshops, as well as a final workshop, will be organized late in year 3 \nto define future steps. Key activities for the main outputs are described below. \n \na.  In-depth Assessment of the Vegetable Supply Chain in Cambodia, \nLao PDR, and Viet Nam \n21.  The implementing agency will: \n(i)  assess needs and constraints in the vegetable supply chain, and  \n(ii)  identify key strategies for its improvement.  \n \n22.  Information exists that postharvest losses in vegetables are considerable. However, this \ninformation is incomplete and not widely known. The extent of postharvest losses differs based \non crops, season, marketplace, and available infrastructure. The economic value of postharvest \nlosses is a direct function of the commodities\u2019 market price. Both the extent and the value of \npostharvest losses are important in determining priorities for the development of postharvest \ntechnologies  for  vegetables.  A  preliminary  study,  based  on  key  informant  interviews  and \nstakeholder meetings, including farming communities and the private sector, would identify: (i) \ndemand for postharvest technologies, (ii) priority research areas for certain vegetable crops, \nand (iii) existing constraints, as well as potentials in rural communities for consideration in \ndeveloping postharvest technologies. Equal representation of both genders will be encouraged. \n \nb.  Promotion  of  High-yielding  Varieties  of  Popular  Vegetables  with \nImproved  Shipping  and  Processing  Qualities  Selected  and  Made \nAvailable  \n23.  The implementing agency will: \n(i)  conduct on-farm testing and shelf-life tests of promising tomato varieties, \n(ii)  select two or three high-yielding varieties of popular vegetables and make them \navailable to farming communities, and \n(iii)  identify three to five suitable low-cost postharvest technologies and introduce \nthem to farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs. \n \n24.  Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam have identified the AVRDC tomato variety \nCLN1462A as promising and worthy of extensive on-farm testing. Fruit firmness is a key feature \nof CLN1462A; it is believed that its shelf life will be longer, and postharvest losses lower, than \nthose of local varieties. In 2004, AVRDC released new tomato varieties for processing that \nresist leaf curl viruses, which are now the leading threat to tomato crops in the region. These \nvarieties will also be included in on-farm testing. AVRDC will provide 5 to10 additional firm-\nfruited tomato varieties of other market types (such as cherry tomatoes) for yield and shelf life \nevaluation.  \n \n25.  Chili pepper will be another high-priority crop. Anthracnose is the major postharvest \ndisease of pepper, reducing yields by 20% or more in some Asian countries. The Project will \nintroduce AVRDC\u2019s new anthracnose-resistant chili pepper varieties to farmers. These are the ", "  Appendix 3  27 \nworld\u2019s only varieties that resist this disease.  High-yielding varieties of other popular vegetables \nfor  shipping  and  processing  will  be  identified.  The  quality  and  yield  of  vegetables  will  be \nevaluated in selecting for postharvest traits. Value-added services such as processing will be \nexplored.  \n \n26.  Improved harvesting techniques, such as harvesting at the optimal time of day and stage \nof plant development, as well as pre-cooling, packaging, and cooling, will help reduce losses \nduring shipping and marketing at the wholesale, retail, and consumer levels. Research will focus \non testing innovative, low-cost postharvest technologies on both leafy and fruit vegetables. Pre-\ncooling techniques and disinfectant technologies will be developed and standardized for each \nvegetable. Product handling using traditional methods and locally available materials will be \ntested.  Packaging  techniques  and  methods  will  be  developed  and  standardized  for  each \nvegetable, using locally available materials.  \n \nc.  Training,  Capacity  Building,  and  Information  in  Postharvest \nHandling and Processing  \n27.  The implementing agency will: \n(i)  initiate a model postharvest and processing microenterprise, \n(ii)  conduct training in postharvest technologies, and \n(iii)  collect and widely disseminate market information on seasonality, and current \nstatus, of postharvest problems and opportunities. \n \n28.  A model postharvest and processing microenterprise will be initiated and established \njointly with small-scale entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial villagers. This microenterprise will be \nassisted in developing value-added products, depending on demand. Product ideas include \npickles,  sun-dried  vegetables,  dehydrated  vegetable  products,  juice,  fermented  vegetables, \nvegetable teas, and vegetable ground powders. This initiative is expected to promote small-\nscale enterprises for vegetable-related food products. Initially, only one country will be involved. \nGroups of producers, processors, marketers, researchers, and extension specialists from the \nother two countries will be invited to the model enterprise for training and the exchange of ideas. \n \n29.  Through regional projects, AVRDC has developed a network of institutes where training \ncourses for producers, researchers, and extension specialists are conducted regularly. The \nproposed  project  will  expand  training  into  postharvest  technologies  and  microindustry \ndevelopment. Each year, specialized training courses focusing on these technologies will be \nprovided to 60 producers, processors, marketers, and NARS. At least 50% of the trainees will \nbe women. Curricula will focus on introducing shipping/processing-type varieties, improving field \nharvesting  mechanisms,  developing  low-cost  cooling  facilities,  adding  value  to  vegetable \nproducts, introducing appropriate processing techniques, identifying markets, and managing \nmicroindustries. Scientists and educational materials from AVRDC headquarters and its Asian \nRegional Center will support training, in collaboration with country coordinators and NARS staff. \nThe model industry supported under the Project will provide hands-on training for trainees from \nthe three countries.  \n \n30.  A major constraint to wider dissemination of postharvest technologies is that information \nis not easily available to farmers and marketers. To improve their access to information, a web \nsite will be developed with links to price information and publications on the current status of \npostharvest  problems  and  opportunities.  Bulletins  and  other  publications  on  postharvest \ntechnologies will be written and translated into local languages. \n ", "28   Appendix 3 \nd.  Partnerships Among the CLV Countries Strengthened \n \n31.  Conduct Regular Workshops and Develop Joint Work Plans. Partnerships will be \nestablished  and  strengthened  among  various  national  universities,  organizations,  research \ninstitutes,  and  extension  agencies  through  AVRDC  (see  appendixes).  Cross-border \npartnerships and economic cooperation in the postharvest sector will be strengthened by joint \nplanning and priority-setting exercises, coordinated implementation activities, training of national \nstaff, exchange of experiences, and easy access to a database shared by the participating \ncountries. \n \n4.  Costs and Financing  \n32.  The cost of the proposed project for the initial 3 years is estimated at $1,550,000 (Table \nA3.2). It is proposed that ADB provide $700,000 (including a contingency fund of $20,000) to \nfinance 45% of the Project. The remaining cost will be financed by AVRDC ($600,000 or 39% of \nthe cost) and by the NARS ($250,000 or 16%). ADB\u2019s funds will mainly finance the Project\u2019s \noperational costs, essential equipment, monitoring and coordination, and project administration. \nIn-kind contributions by AVRDC and the NARS will support personnel, facilities, equipment, and \nother goods and services. AVRDC will provide staff expertise to further develop and provide \nvegetable varieties with improved postharvest qualities. \n \nTable A3.2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($ '000) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nCurrency Currency  Cost \nA.

National \nteams will be responsible for specific research and technology transfer in the field. Under the \nTA, a total of 40 person-months of international consultants will be engaged (a postharvest \ntechnologist-project manager for 36 months; and database development, monitoring specialist, \nand  plant  physiologists  for  4  months);  and  36  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  (a \nmarketing specialist and support staff for 36 months).  \n ", "30   Appendix 3 \n34.  A detailed work plan will be finalized in an inception workshop within 3 months from the \nProject\u2019s  start.  Its  proceedings,  and  outcomes  from  other  project  workshops  and  training \nactivities, will be reported soon after the events. A steering committee will be formed, chaired by \nthe AVRDC director general or deputy director general for research.  \n \n35.  AVRDC will be required to submit the following reports to ADB: (i) the inception report, \n(ii) semiannual progress reports, (iii) semiannual financial statements accounting for use of \nproject funds, (iv) audited annual financial statements, and (v) a comprehensive completion \nreport. The inception report will be submitted within 3 months from the Project\u2019s start, the \nsemiannual progress reports and financial statements every 6 months, and the comprehensive \ncompletion report within 3 months from project closure. \n \n36.  The EA will also organize annual planning and review meetings and a project completion \nworkshop, which  all  project  partners,  including  ADB,  will  attend.  At  the  project  completion \nworkshop,  project  achievements  will  be  reviewed  and  the  strategy  to  ensure  continuity  of \nselection and dissemination activities beyond the present ADB-AVRDC project will be outlined. \nThe workshop will recommend sustainable approaches to ensure continuity of the improvement \nprograms initiated.  \n \n37.  AVRDC  will  procure  goods  and  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, and will engage consultants by ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \nD.  Potential Project Impact \n38.  Relationship to ADB Priorities. The proposed Project is directly related to ADB\u2019s key \npriority of sustained pro-poor economic growth in the region. Vegetable-based postharvest \ntechnologies will enhance productivity and help increase household food security and income. \nAlso,  ADB  country  strategies  for  the  CLV  region  focus  on  sustainable  growth  through \nagricultural diversification and private sector development. The Project will facilitate agricultural \ndiversification by making vegetable production less risky and more profitable for farmers, and \nwill contribute to private sector development by making improved technologies and information \navailable to the processing sector. \n \n39.  Expected Benefits. The Project is expected to (i) reduce average postharvest losses for \nhigh-value vegetable crops (at least 10% for tomatoes, 20% for leafy vegetables) in target \nareas, (ii) provide employment for both men and women in the rural labor force by stimulating \npostharvest industries, (iii) enhance private sector competitiveness by providing access to low-\ncost technologies and market information, and (iv) increase the year-round availability of fresh \nand  processed  vegetables,  thus  contributing  to  healthier  diets  and  nutrition.  As  described \nearlier, the current average postharvest losses of 30% in vegetables cost the CLV countries \nabout $300 million annually. Reducing average postharvest losses by 5%, from 30% to 25%, \nwould thus contribute to additional long-term income of about $50 million annually, to be shared \nby  producers,  wholesalers,  and  retailers.  This  does  not  take  into  consideration  additional \nincome through newly created employment opportunities, or increased vegetable demand; both \nwould create substantial additional economic benefit.  \n \n40.  Potential for Adoption. Technology adoption by the model postharvest handling and \nprocessing industries is projected to be high and widespread, because growth in vegetable \nproduction in Southeast Asia has averaged 5%/year over the past 10 years. Thus activities \nrelated to vegetable production and processing are attractive investment opportunities. Also, as ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nmore consumers move to urban areas, demand for processed vegetables will increase, as has \nbeen show in other countries. Selection of priority vegetables and appropriate technologies will \nbe determined though a consultation process involving major stakeholders from the private and \npublic sectors and thus, will increase the potential for adoption.  \n \n41.  Potential Constraints to Achievements. The success of the Project will depend on \ncontinued support of partner institutions in the development of postharvest and processing \ntechnologies to support rural small-scale industries. Success will also be determined by the \nidentification of suitable varieties and technologies. But initial successes with the tomato variety \nCLN1462A has shown that promising varieties are available. Replication and expansion of the \nProject\u2019s impacts will largely depend on an enabling environment for industries, such as access \nto information, competitive access to markets, and availability of credit.  \n \n1.  Monitoring Plan \n42.  Monitoring  will  be  based  on  the  semiannual  submission  of  progress  reports  from \nparticipating countries and monitoring of progress indicators, targets, and work plans developed \nin the initial and following annual planning workshops. During years 2 and 3, a short-term \nconsultant will evaluate progress, define constraints to implementation, and suggest solutions. \nCommunity stakeholders will be involved in the consultation. \n \n2.  Personnel \n43.  Project implementation requires staff involvement to: \n(i)  Coordinate the overall Project  (AVRDC); \n(ii)  Coordinate  activities  within  participating  member  countries  (country \nrepresentatives) (Table A3.3); \n(iii)  Perform research and outreach activities (AVRDC and NARS); and \n(iv)  Secure  input  of  specific  expertise  in  areas  such  as  project  management, \npostharvest technologies, market assessment, and monitoring (funded by ADB). \n \n \nTable A3.3: Implementing and Collaborating Agencies \n \nCountry  Implementing Agencies  Contact Person \nCambodia  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry  Srun Sokhom \nand Fisheries  Deputy Director \nPhnom Penh  Department of Agronomy and \n  Agricultural Land Improvement \n   \nRoyal University of Phnom Penh  Prof. Pit Chamnan, Rector \n   \nLao People\u2019s Democratic  Ministry of Agriculture and  Kham Sanatem \nRepublic  Forestry, Vientiane  Assistant Director General \n  Department of Agriculture \n \nViet Nam  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural  Prof. Dr. Vu Manh Hai \nDevelopment, Research Institute  Director  \nof Fruits and Vegetables, Hanoi   \n   \n \nAVRDC \u2013 The World Vegetable Center.

Introduction \n1.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  implementation  of  drought \ntolerance research and dissemination activities for maize systems. The value of local farmers\u2019 \nknowledge, interests, and ability to experiment and innovate will be recognized. The objective is \nto increase and stabilize maize productivity in five major maize-growing countries of East and \nSoutheast Asia by developing improved maize varieties, and enhancing the capacity of the \nnational  agriculture  research  systems  (NARS)  to  develop  and  deliver  stress-tolerant,  high \nyielding  varieties  suitable  for  drought-prone  areas.  This  proposal  targets  the  tropical \nenvironments  in  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  southern  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC), \nThailand, and Viet Nam where maize farmers are often exposed to the risk of drought and to \nhousehold food insecurity.  \n \n2.  Drought stress is the most widespread abiotic constraint in maize production, and a \nmajor cause of yield loss in the tropics, where most maize is grown under rainfed conditions. In \na  study  on  sustainable  intensification  of  rainfed  upland  farming  systems  (funded  by  the \nInternational Fund for Agriculture and Development, 2000\u20132002), drought emerged as a priority \nconstraint in farmer surveys and secondary data gathered on maize-based production systems \nin seven Asian countries, including the five targeted in the proposal. During the annual meeting \nof  the  Asian  Maize  Biotechnology  Network  (AMBIONET)  in  Thailand  in  November  2003, \nparticipants from nine Asian countries, again including all five targeted countries, underscored \nthe need for a concerted effort to tackle drought in ways that exploit the synergies of regional \ncooperation. \n \n3.  The proposed Project reflects the increasing importance given to drought by many Asian \nNARS. The NARS are actively involved in country-specific as well as regional research using \nmolecular tools in maize breeding, including efforts to breed for drought tolerance, through \nAMBIONET, an Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded project of the International Maize and \nWheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in partnership with Asian NARS. The proposed Project \nwill build on the strong regional interest and growing momentum to improve maize productivity \nin drought-prone environments.  \n \nB.  Issues and Constraints \n4.  Maize is currently Asia\u2019s third most important cereal crop. But demand for maize in the \nregion is projected to surpass both rice and wheat, increasing in East and Southeast Asia from \n150  million  tons  in  1995  to  280 million  tons  in  2020  (International  Food  Policy  Research \nInstitute, 2000, as cited by Pingali and Pandey, 2001).1 This growth in maize demand is leading \nto the intensification of higher-potential production systems and major expansion into more \nmarginal environments, with increased reliance on dry season planting. Except in the PRC, \nsmall-scale, subsistence-oriented farmers grow much of the maize in rainfed areas.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Pingali, P.L. and S. Pandey. 2001. Meeting world maize needs: Technological opportunities and priorities for the \npublic sector. In: Pingali, P.L. (ed.).

Meeting world maize needs: Technological opportunities and priorities for \nthe public sector. Mexico, D.F.: CIMMYT. ", "  Appendix 4  33 \n5.  Maize crops in the tropics suffer regularly from drought, a pervasive cause of yield \ninstability  in  rainfed  cropping  systems.  Throughout  Asia,  drought  affects  about  10  million \nhectares (ha) of maize and reduces production by more than 30 million tons yearly. Although \ndrought occurs in most environments, its incidence and intensity cannot be predicted. In much \nof East and Southeast Asia, maize is produced largely on upland or sloping fields, where \nshallow soils can lead to drought conditions within a relatively short period with no rain. With \nincreased use of second-season, or off-season, plantings and shifts to marginal lands, the \nlikelihood of water deficits and losses due to drought are also increasing. Drought impacts \nfarmers with devastating effects\u2014they not only lose their crops, but also suffer additional costs \nin coping with the effects of drought, such as reduced food consumption, borrowing money, and \nselling  of  assets.  Considering  the  importance  of  drought  to  farming  households  whose \nlivelihoods depend on maize production, new approaches must be found to increase and \nstabilize crop yields in these areas. Main issues that the Project will address follow.   \n \n6.  Resistance to Drought is a Major Factor in Stabilization of Crop Performance in \nWater-Stressed Environments. Many crop and water management technologies that mitigate \nthe effects of drought are available, but they are often knowledge-intensive and site-specific, \nand can require major investments in labor and cash. Resilient, high-yielding maize varieties \nthat withstand water stress offer benefits at a low recurrent cost and can be broadly applicable \nto large areas. \n \n7.  Adapting Maize to Drought-Prone Environments Requires a Deliberate Breeding \nEffort. Breeding for drought tolerance is difficult because of the variability in the timing and \nseverity  of  drought,  the  genetic  complexity  of  drought  tolerance,  and  strong  genotype-by-\nenvironment interactions. In recent years, CIMMYT has demonstrated breeding strategies that \ncan produce maize cultivars with higher and more stable yields, including the selection of maize \nunder carefully managed drought stress and selection of secondary traits associated with high \nlevels of drought tolerance. In some extremely harsh environments in southern Africa, for \nexample, such drought-tolerant maize can raise grain yields by 10\u201320% at the 1\u20132 t/ha level, \nyet still match yields of other varieties when grown in high-yield environments. \n \n8.  Much  Remains  to  be  done  to  Diffuse  New  Varieties  to  Farmers.  Despite  the \nsignificant coverage of improved varieties in the region, more than 30% of the maize area (60% \nin the Philippines) is still sown to unimproved varieties with low potential yields. The spread of \nmodern varieties in many marginal environments has been slowed by their unsuitability for the \nproduction and consumption requirements of people who live in the areas. Furthermore, many \nsmall-scale maize farmers do not have access to quality seed of improved varieties. CIMMYT \nhas successfully applied participatory methodologies in the Southern Africa Drought and Low \nSoil Fertility Project, which was initiated in 1996 and is ongoing.  \n \n9.  Substantial Resources are Required to Address Complex Problems, Underscoring \na Vital Need for Working Effectively in Collaborative Relationships. Networking scientists \npartner  together  so  that  they  can  address  common  problems  and  create  synergies  and \neconomic efficiency at the regional level. CIMMYT facilitates the ADB-funded AMBIONET, \nwhich has built an enabling environment in the region, resulting in the integration of molecular \ntools  for  maize  breeding  research  in  the  NARS,  and  fostering  a  culture  of  sharing  and \ninteraction among maize scientists. As AMBIONET nears its end (in December 2004), its \nestablished synergies can be harnessed through the proposed Project to reach resource-poor \nfarmers in Asia by adding an essential dimension of technology dissemination, involving farmer \nparticipatory technology evaluation and linkages to seed/technology producers and retailers. \n ", "34   Appendix 4 \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Rationale \n10.  In many parts of East and Southeast Asia, maize is grown in drought-prone rainfed \nuplands  and  other  marginal  areas,  mainly  to  meet  the  subsistence  needs  of  the  poorest \nhouseholds, including ethnic minorities for whom maize is the primary staple. Farmers face an \nincreasing risk of drought, due partly to global climate changes, the displacement or expansion \nof maize cultivation to more difficult environments, and declines in soil organic matter that \nreduce soil fertility and water-holding capacity. The need is urgent for improved maize varieties \nthat can better withstand drought and other stresses and produce more grain to raise the \naverage yields and crop-related income of farming households.   \n \n11.  Breeding for enhanced drought tolerance is a challenging because of the complexity of \nthe  trait,  difficulties  in  field  evaluation  and  selection,  and  strong  genotype-by-environment \ninteractions.  In  general,  and  especially  for  favorable  environments,  a  centralized  global \napproach to germplasm improvement has been successful by relying on use of purchased \ninputs to create a uniform environment suited to germplasm characteristics. But this approach \nhas largely failed to address the diversity of environmental conditions and end-user needs in \nsmallholder, subsistence-oriented farming systems where large amounts of purchased inputs \nare  often  not  available  or  are  unprofitable.  Furthermore,  it  is  evident  that  many  modern \nvarieties, because they have not been developed from farmers\u2019 concerns and conditions, have \nnot readily diffused to farmers in marginal environments.   \n \n12.  Despite  the  challenges  of  developing  drought-tolerant,  farmer-preferred  varieties, \nprogress has been substantial and the probability of success is high. Understanding is now \nbetter  of  the  maize  crop\u2019s  behavior  under  drought  stress.  New  breeding  methodologies \nenhance selection efficiency have been developed, including the use of carefully managed \nstress  conditions  (by  controlling  the  timing,  intensity,  and  uniformity  of  the  stress  through \nirrigation) and the development of physiological selection criteria (secondary traits that relate to \nyield under drought) for stress resistance. Particularly successful has been the development of \nmaize with anthesis-silking synchrony under water deficit at flowering, allowing greater grain set \nand  grain  yield  in  drought  conditions.  More  recently,  molecular  methods  such  as  marker-\nassisted selection are being adopted for more efficient selection for distinct components of \nstress resistance. Furthermore, major advances have been made in understanding the social \ncontext of technological change. With the realization that the clients of new technologies have \nmuch to contribute to their development and dissemination, participatory methodologies that \nbetter  incorporate  the  knowledge  and  preferences  of  technology  end  users  have  been \ndeveloped, refined, and successfully applied.  \n \n13.  Considering all these factors, CIMMYT is uniquely positioned to effectively implement \nthe proposed Project with its Asian NARS partners, and to ensure that higher-yielding varieties \nwith tolerance to drought (and other stresses in the local environments) will reach farmers\u2019 \nfields. This Project will help build the capacity of NARS scientists to develop and effectively \ndeliver improved maize varieties to their constituents by taking the lessons learned, especially \nthose from Africa where drought is one of the two most severe challenges of subsistence \nagriculture (low soil fertility is the other), and adapting them in the Asian context. \n \n14.  Value  to  Related  ADB  Projects  and  Strategies.  Suitable  drought-tolerant  maize \nvarieties will increase productivity in drought-prone environments and help stabilize production \nsystems. Over the long term, this will reduce drought-related risks that farm families face, and ", "  Appendix 4  35 \nincrease their food security. Furthermore, increased productivity per unit of land, water, and \nlabor invested may lessen the pressure to expand cultivation into more fragile environments. \nSimilar to the ADB-funded AMBIONET, this proposed TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s emphasis on \nsupporting regional cooperation and strengthening regional ties. We expect activities, products, \nand  experiences  of  this  Project  to  also  prove  relevant  and  benefit  other  ADB  developing \nmember countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, and \nPakistan.   \n \n15.  Other Projects and Activities Related to the Proposed Project. CIMMYT is well \nplaced to take advantage of the latest knowledge and technologies that can contribute to \nimprovement of maize for enhanced drought tolerance. For example CIMMYT, along with the \nInternational Plant Genetic Research Institute and the International Rice Research Institute, \nhelped  establish  the  Generation  Challenge  Program  (www.generationcp.org)  that  uses \ncomparative genetics and synteny to take drought tolerance and other traits to new levels of \nexpression. Also, this TA will add value to other international crop improvement programs that \nfocus on drought, such as the Rockefeller Foundation Program on Resilient Crops for Water-\nLimited Environments, in which CIMMYT is an active partner. \n \n16.  Because  the  duration  of  the  proposed  Project  is  extremely  short,  considering  the \ncomplexity of the task, it is essential to acknowledge that the Project will begin by evaluating the \ndrought tolerance of existing maize varieties and their suitability for use in drought-prone areas. \nAn important early outcome of drought tolerance work in southern Africa, for example, was the \nidentification and subsequent recommendation of two or three best hybrids among many that \nwere commercially available. Similarly, experimental varieties from ongoing breeding projects, \nsuch as quality protein maize (QPM) research will be evaluated and may provide the first \nmaterials for farmer-participatory evaluation in drought-prone areas. Thus, the Project will have \nconcurrent short-, medium-, and long-term objectives, building on existing elite materials and \nnew sources of stress tolerance. \n \n2.  Purpose and Outputs \n17.  The overall goal of the proposed TA is to increase and stabilize maize productivity in five \nmajor tropical maize-growing countries of East and Southeast Asia (southern PRC, Indonesia, \nThe Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam) by developing, and enhancing the capacity of NARS \nto develop and deliver, stress-tolerant, high-yielding maize varieties suitable for drought-prone \nareas. The project has the following specific purposes: \n(i)  Identify and/or develop high-yielding maize varieties that tolerate drought and \nother prevailing stresses by selection for drought tolerance-conferring traits under \nmanaged stress field conditions; \n(ii)  Evaluate  drought-tolerant  and  other  promising  maize  cultivars  developed  by \nNARS and CIMMYT for adaptability to local conditions and farmer preferences \nthrough farmer participatory trials in at least two countries; \n(iii)  Enhance the capacity of NARS researchers to apply new technologies to support \nvariety development; and  \n(iv)  Build on the network established within the ADB-funded AMBIONET to maintain \na network of maize scientists fostering collaborative interactions and the sharing \nof information and experiences. \n \n \n \n ", "36   Appendix 4 \n18.  The following outputs are expected from the proposed TA: \n(i)  Output  1.  High-yielding,  stress-tolerant  maize  varieties  locally  adapted  to \ndrought-prone areas of East and Southeast Asia (especially within the five target \ncountries) will be identified, and development of others will be initiated; \n(ii)  Output 2. Enhanced capacity of NARS, and steps toward institutionalizing an \napproach by NARS to conduct maize improvement for drought tolerance and \nintegrate farmer-participatory approaches in the selection and dissemination of \nimproved maize varieties; and  \n(iii)  Output 3. An effective and functional network of NARS partners working to \nenhance maize productivity in the region \n \n19.  Output 1 will have site-specific tangible outcomes that will directly benefit farmers at key \nsites  in  the  proposed  project  countries.  Output  2  will  directly  benefit  maize  scientists  and \nworkers  of  participating  NARS,  helping  to  build  enhanced  core  competencies  for  maize \nresearch,  development,  and  dissemination  in  rainfed  environments;  and  to  support  the \ninstitutionalization of needs-driven, participatory research and delivery methods. The enhanced \ncapacity of the NARS to deliver suitable and acceptable technologies will benefit maize farmers \nin  each  country.  Output  3  will  create  regional  synergies  that  will  extract  added  value  by \npromoting  the  sharing  of  research  experiences  and  technologies  among  countries.  Such \nregional exchange will result in significant spillover benefits to other countries in the region.   \n \n3.  Methodology and Key Activities \n20.  The primary focus of the Project will be in five major maize-growing countries in tropical \nSoutheast  Asia:  southern  PRC,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  These \ncountries are already engaged in the development of high-yielding maize with tolerance to \nvarious  stresses,  including  drought  tolerance,  with  the  use  of  molecular  tools  to  aid \nconventional breeding as AMBIONET participants. As AMBIONET ends, the proposed Project \nwill build on AMBIONET\u2019s achievements and strengthen links between molecular and field-\nbased  breeding  approaches,  and  breeding  and  technology  verification  and  dissemination \nactivities. \n \n21.  Specific project activities will be incorporated into a set of individual country workplans, \ndeveloped  by  the  NARS  with  involvement  of  local  researchers  for  development-oriented \norganizations,  government  extension  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and \nfarmers.  CIMMYT  will  lead  and  coordinate  the  proposed  Project,  provide  guidance  and \ntechnical expertise, and link with other crop improvement efforts (global and regional) that \ntarget drought-prone environments. CIMMYT will also guide and facilitate, initially in one or two \nselected countries, an inclusive approach that involves a wider range of actors in technology \nverification and dissemination activities in each country, aiming to redress the common history \nof low technology adoption (particularly of \u201cmodern\u201d crop varieties) by resource-poor farmers. \nCoordination will be through several mechanisms, including an initial inception meeting and \nannual  planning  and  review  meetings,  charting  and  monitoring  of  workflows,  timely \ncommunication of results, and team visits.

This  will  involve  researcher-\nmanaged replicated \u201cmother trials\u201d in small plots at several locations implemented by NARS, \nand farmer-managed unreplicated \u201cbaby trials\u201d in large plots near the mother trials but planted \nand  managed  by  farmers  on  their  own  fields.  Data  from  the  trials  will  be  compiled  and \ndisseminated regionally. The Project will also actively assist in the dissemination of these \nmaterials though formal and informal seed sectors. \n \nb.  Enhanced  Drought  Breeding  and  Farmer  Participatory  Research \nCapacity of the National Agricultural Research System  \n24.  The key activities will include: \n(i)  Capacity building will be through regional and in-country training courses that \nCIMMYT  and  NARS  organize  jointly  on  topics  of  relevance  to  the  project \nworkplans, and \n(ii)  CIMMYT will provide or facilitate scientific and technical backstopping to, and \namong, the NARS. \n \n25.  CIMMYT will implement the Project with East and Southeast Asian NARS, many of \nwhom have been adversely affected by cuts in funding for public research. Thus, professional \n                                                 \n2  Mother-baby trials allow farmers and researchers to test best-bet technologies or new cultivars. Trials are of two \ntypes: the researcher-managed mother trials evaluate a set of promising cultivars (9 to 16 cultivars) under optimal \nand farmer-representative management conditions and is located in the center of a farming community, or at a \nresearch station. All baby trials contain a subset of the cultivars in the mother trial (no more than four) and are \nplanted and managed exclusively by the farmers that host them. ", "40   Appendix 4 \ndevelopment  will  be  an  important  project  component.  Through  the  proposed  TA,  NARS \nscientists will learn the latest theories and practices in drought breeding, and will discuss and \nhelp  adapt  and  implement  methodologies  for  on-farm  verification  and  farmer  participation. \nProject funds will be allotted for in-country work that will supplement national funds to enable \nNARS scientists to apply newly learned skills and methods in the project agenda.   \n \nc.  An Effective and Functional Network of Partners Working Toward \nEnhanced Maize Productivity in the Region \n26.  The activities will include: \n(i)  Participatory network coordination, and  \n(ii)  Annual meetings to present and discuss findings and progress, plan work, agree \non priorities, and allocate funding. \n \n27.  A broad-based, dynamic regional network that facilitates the development and delivery \nof maize varieties that meet farmers\u2019 requirements and preferences will allow economies of \nscale and carry the Project\u2019s goal beyond the duration of the proposed TA. \n \n28.  Linkages and Collaboration with Other Projects. The Project will draw on knowledge \nand products generated by other CIMMYT projects such as the Southern Africa Drought and \nLow Soil Fertility Project in Africa and the Hill Maize Research Project in Nepal. For the NARS, \nthe  Project  complements  on-going  national  efforts  for  maize  germplasm  development  and \ntesting, such as their national QPM programs, by evaluating their products for suitability and \nfarmer acceptance in drought-prone environments. It is important to note that the proposed \nproject will not entail a \u201cnew\u201d research program to be established by each participating NARS. \nInstead,  the  Project  entails  re-tooling  and  re-orienting  existing  breeding  research  activities \n(including new germplasm and technology dissemination) to effectively and deliberately improve \ndrought tolerance, and dissemination of the research products. \n \n29.  Intellectual Property Issues. CIMMYT develops public goods that are freely available \nto developing countries. Each project participant will be free to develop proprietary technologies \nwithin his or her institution, but products developed collaboratively under this TA will be freely \navailable and will remain in the public domain. The exchange and use of germplasm will be \nsubject to an agreed-upon material transfer agreement.   \n \n4.  Cost and Financing \n30.  The proposed TA is estimated to cost $1.89 million over 3 years. CIMMYT requests \n$750,000 from ADB to finance 40% of the project cost. CIMMYT will cover the remaining cost of \n$737,000, and participating national programs will cover $400,000 through in-kind contributions \n(Table  A4.2).  The  TA  will  cover  costs  for  project  coordination;  in-country  research; \nbackstopping; and training, workshops, and meetings. In-country research funds will cover the \ncost of upgrading existing facilities to enable managed field research on drought stress to be \nconducted in two or three participating countries, plus the costs of relevant, small research \nprojects.  CIMMYT  will  provide  professional  time  of  its  staff,  germplasm  from  CIMMYT \nheadquarters and regional stations (especially CIMMYT-Zimbabwe), and support for research \nexpenses. The NARS will give their scientists\u2019 time, expertise, and local knowledge; use of their \nland and facilities, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  41 \nTable A4.2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange Currency  Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n31.  CIMMYT  will  be  the  Project\u2019s  Executing  Agency  (EA).  CIMMYT  will  coordinate  the \nProject, and implement it in a participatory mode to ensure that NARS and other local and \nregional partners have ownership of the project outcomes, and the commitment to sustain \nactivities beyond the Project. Partnerships will be established with different stakeholders who \nare active in the project sites, including NARS and relevant NGOs, farmers\u2019 organizations, and \nseed companies.   \n \n32.  CIMMYT will provide 3 person-years of input to the Project, to work in collaboration with \npartners  from  the  five  countries.  CIMMYT  resource  scientists  will  provide  expertise  and ", "42   Appendix 4 \nexperience. A national coordinator will coordinate technical activities in each country. Also, two \nor three countries will be responsible for developing and operating the Project\u2019s managed stress \nsites. Under the TA, consultants (baseline studies, capacity building, regional coordination, and \ngeographic information services specialists) will be hired to address specific needs that are \nidentified and agreed upon during the inception workshop. \n \n33.  The detailed work plan will be finalized in the inception workshop, which will be held \nwithin 3 months of the Project\u2019s start. The inception workshop proceedings, and outcomes from \nother project workshops and training, will be reported soon after the events.  \n \n34.  CIMMYT will submit the following reports to ADB: (i) inception reports, (ii) semiannual \nprogress reports, (iii) semiannual financial statements that account for the use of project funds, \n(iv)  audited  annual  financial  statements,  and  (v)  a  comprehensive  completion  report.  The \ninception report will be submitted within 3 months after the Project begins, the semiannual \nprogress reports and financial statements every 6 months, and the comprehensive completion \nreport within 3 months of project closure. \n \n35.  The EA will also organize annual planning and review meetings and a project completion \nworkshop,  which  all  project  partners,  including  ADB,  will  attend.  The  project  completion \nworkshop will be held to review project achievements and to outline the strategy to ensure \ncontinuity  of  the  selection  and  dissemination  activities  beyond  the  present  ADB-CIMMYT \nproject. The workshop will recommend sustainable approaches to ensure continuity of the \nimprovement programs initiated in the Project.  \n \n36.  CIMMYT  will  procure  goods  and  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \nD.  Potential Project Impact  \n37.  Relationship of the Project to ADB Priorities. The proposed Project advances the \nADB  strategic  framework  goals  of  reducing poverty  and  protecting  the  environment.  High-\nyielding and resilient maize varieties that meet the diverse requirements of drought-prone, \nmarginal environments will enhance productivity, and help increase household food security and \nincome.   \n \n38.  Social, Economic, and Environmental Benefits. The Project will help increase yields \nand stabilize maize production in Asia, especially benefiting resource-poor farmers who are \npoorly served by the commercial seed sector. When these farmers can produce more, using \nimproved varieties and good management of existing land resources, pressure will be less to \nexpand into marginal areas, and degradation of fragile environments will be less. Furthermore, \nfarmer participatory varietal selection is expected to result in increased adoption of improved \nvarieties, leading to higher production and improved livelihood security for farmers in less-\nfavorable environments.   \n \n39.  Potential for Adoption. The Project\u2019s farmer participatory approach will empower rural \ncommunities to influence the selection of experimental lines to be formally released and planted \nas new varieties. The use of the mother-baby trials will ensure that the improved maize varieties \nare  responsive  to  specific  farmers\u2019  conditions  and  thus,  increase  the  potential  for  farmer \nadoption.  The  Project\u2019s  deliberate  links  to  seed  dissemination  organizations  (e.g.,  seed \ncompanies, NGOs, etc.) will increase farmer access to quality seeds.  ", "  Appendix 4  43 \n40.  Potential  Constraints.  No  major  technical  constraints  are  anticipated  because \nCIMMYT and its partners have already implemented these approaches in Africa, and are now \nimplementing them in Nepal. The keen interest of Asian NARS to participate in the proposed \nproject, reinforced by their positive experience in AMBIONET and CIMMYT\u2019s track record of \ncoordinating research in the region, lessens the risk that the proposed collaboration will fail. \nAchievement of project objectives could be adversely affected by a significant deterioration in \nthe financial health of NARS partners that limits their ability to commit resources. Beyond the \ncontrol of the project stakeholders, there is risk that participation of some countries could be \nnegatively  affected  by  social  conflicts,  political  instability,  or  disease  epidemics.  Economic \npolicies  that  decrease  the  profitability  or  viability  of  maize  farming  could  also  reduce  the \nlikelihood  of  success.  Climatic  change  caused  by  global  warming,  deforestation,  and  soil \nerosion in parts of the region could drive water deficits in crop systems beyond the level where \ndrought tolerant maize can help. \n \n1.  Monitoring Plan \n41.  Monitoring will be guided by the Project\u2019s logical framework. The project organizational \nmeeting will formalize the country workplans and agreements for collective responsibilities. \nEach country team will chart its component activities, and adjust them when needed.  Project \nparticipants will meet yearly to present and review progress made in the past year and to plan \nactivities for the coming year.   \n \n2.  Personnel \n42.  The director of CIMMYT\u2019s Tropical Ecosystems Program will be project leader, with \noverall responsibility for the Project. He or she will appoint a project coordinator to manage day-\nto-day operations and keep the Project on target, on time, and on budget. CIMMYT staff and \nshort-term consultants will provide expertise in breeding, pathology, entomology, agronomy, \nparticipatory methods, and seed systems. NARS collaborators will coordinate and manage in-\ncountry activities, plus maintain the regional stress screening sites and evaluate regional trials \n(Table A4.3) \n \nTable A4.3: Implementing and Collaborating Agencies \n \nCountry  Implementing Agencies  Contact Person \nIndonesia  Indonesian Center for Food Crops Research  Dr. Djoko S.

Introduction  \n1.  In South Asia, the Rice-Wheat Consortium (RWC)1 countries\u2014Bangladesh, India, Nepal, \nand Pakistan\u2014have almost half of their land area of 402 million hectares (ha) in agriculture, to \nfeed  and  provide  livelihood  for  1.8  billion  people.  Rice  and  wheat,  the  staple  food  crops, \ncontribute more than 80% of the cereal production. The intensively cultivated irrigated rice-\nwheat system is fundamental to employment, income, and livelihood for hundreds of millions of \nrural and urban poor of South Asia. In the past few decades, high growth rates for food grain \nproduction (wheat 3.0%, rice 2.3%) in Consortium countries have kept pace with population \ngrowth.  But  evidence  is  now  appearing  that  rice-wheat  system  productivity  is  plateauing \nbecause of a fatigued natural resource base. Thus, the region\u2019s food security is continuously \nthreatened  and  the  emerging  challenges  of  post-Green  Revolution  (GR)  agriculture  pose \nadditional hurdles. Also, much of the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) has unfavorable rice \necologies where gains from GR technologies have not affected the lives of millions. \n \n2.  Four Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs), under the \numbrella of the Rice-Wheat Consortium for the IGP, in partnership with the International Rice \nResearch  Institute  (IRRI)  and  the  International  Maize  and  Wheat  Improvement  Center \n(CIMMYT), are requesting ADB\u2019s assistance to (i) integrate available rice and wheat production \ntechnologies (RCTs) from IRRI, CIMMYT, and national agricultural research and extension \nsystems  (NARES);  (ii)  evaluate  them  in  farmers\u2019  fields;  and  (iii)  promote  the  successful \ntechnologies to farmers at large. The Project will be implemented through the research-to-\ndelivery  continuum,  and  will  draw  on  the  enormous  experience  of  IRRI  and  CIMMYT  in \nintegrating resource-saving technologies for rice and wheat within the RW system. The new \nknowledge and  technologies  of  IRRI  and  CIMMYT  are  international  public  goods  that can \ntranscend borders and equally benefit the countries in the region. The proposed project will build \non a recently-completed ADB-supported project (RETA 5945)2 in scaling up the benefits of \nvalidated technologies. The Project will have added value in (i) empowering NARES to train \nextension and development personnel and support them in the dissemination of proven RCTs; \n(ii) training of trainers; (iii) developing training, communication, and promotional materials; (iv) \nencouraging greater involvement of the private sector; (v) conducting impact studies in selected \npilot villages; (vi) refining and evaluating new technologies such as double zero-tillage, including \nintegration of sesbania with rice to control weeds, enhance soil quality, and save water in rice-\nwheat-based systems; and (vii) developing strategies to eliminate burning of crop residues.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The Rice-Wheat Consortium (RWC) is a National Agricultural Research and Extension System (NARES)-driven \ninitiative that has emerged as an innovative model for regional and international collaboration, and operates as an \ninter-institutional  and  inter-center,  multidisciplinary  network  that  facilitates  system-based  farmer  participatory \nresearch in the rice-wheat ecology of the Indo-Gangetic Plains. \u201cThe effectiveness of partnerships among centers \nof the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and their NARES partners, as well as \namong the four national systems, is among the most important achievements of the RWC\u201d (extracted from the \nReview  Panel  Report  The  Rice-Wheat  Consortium--an  Institutional  Innovation  in  International  Agricultural \nResearch on the Rice-Wheat Cropping Systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plains, 2003). \n2  ADB. 2001. Regional Technical Assistance for the Fifth Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at CGIAR \nCenters. Manila. ", "  Appendix 5  45 \nB.  Issues and Constraints \n \n3.  Tillage and Crop Establishment. The drastically different seedbed requirements for \nrice and wheat create problems in tillage, the timeliness of wheat sowing, maintenance of soil \nstructure, and management of irrigation water, weeds and other pests, fertilizers, and crop \nresidues. The short turnaround time between rice and wheat and the mindset of farmers to \npractice excessive preparatory tillage delay wheat planting, resulting in yield losses of 35 kg/day \nper ha in the northwestern and as much as 60 kg/day per ha in the eastern parts of the IGP. \nAlso, many areas in the eastern IGP remain as \"rice fallows\" because fields remain wet for a \nlong time, forcing farmers to wait before any preparatory tillage is possible for planting other \ncrops. Wheat sowing is also delayed because of the planting of medium-duration (140 days) \nbasmati rice. In eastern parts of the IGP, farmers begin preparatory tillage for the rice nursery \nand transplanting seedlings in the main fields after the onset of the monsoons, resulting in low \ncrop yields. This practice also wastes 400 to 600 millimeters (mm) of rainwater. Advancing rice \ntransplanting through some groundwater development for nursery raising and transplanting \nearly in the season has potential to almost double the total productivity of the RW system and \nenhance farmers' profits.  \n \n4.  Diversification. In the eastern Gangetic plains, agriculture is more drought- and flood-\nprone. Farmers generally use groundwater only in the winter and not in the wet season (kharif). \nThis delays rice establishment and thus, delays the planting of succeeding potato, onion, winter \nmaize, wheat, and other crops. Late planting of rice thus causes a vicious circle of reduced \nyields. To improve farm-gate income and stabilize productivity, farmers' knowledge on the most \nopportune time for planting rice crop should be improved. In flood-prone areas, intercropping \nand the choice of appropriate crop cultivars would be helpful. Besides crop diversification per \nse, increasing biodiversity in the rice-growing season is important.  \n \n5.  More than 4 million ha of land used for rice are estimated to remain as \u201crice fallows\u201d in \nthe IGP alone. With appropriate crop establishment technologies, this land could be used to \nraise  a  second  crop  of  wheat,  pulses,  maize,  or  lentils  to  improve  farmers\u2019  incomes  and \nlivelihoods in marginal areas. Unfortunately, both drought and floods can occur simultaneously, \nas in Bihar, India, in kharif 2002. The land area affected by floods in Bihar was just 2.2 million \nha in the 1950s, but was slightly more than 15 million ha in 2002. Any cropping pattern for such \nareas must consider these risks.  \n \n6.  Postharvest. In Asian countries, it has been estimated that 25\u201350% of the total grain \nvalue is lost through poor timing of harvesting and threshing, inadequate grain moisture control \nat various processing stages, and inefficient grain handling and milling. Farmers may be aware \nof the losses in quantity of grain (10\u201315%), but not the losses in grain quality (10\u201335%) that \ndetermine the market price for their produce. Most farmers allow the rice crop to over-ripen \nbefore harvest and wait for 2 to 5 days between harvest and threshing; these practices increase \ngrain breakage in milling and reduce whole-grain recovery and the price of milled rice. In other \nsituations, farmers harvest the crop and keep it in the main field to dry before processing. \nLosses in quantity and quality at all levels can be lessened through education of farmers in \nharvest and postharvest handling and the use of suitable tools such as moisture meters, milling \ndegree charts, and milling equipment. An improvement in harvest and postharvest processing \nwill enhance the market value of rice and thus improve not only farmers\u2019 income and livelihood \nbut also enhance profit to millers. \n \n7.  Environmental  Benefits.  The  intensification  of  rice-wheat  rotations  has  resulted  in \nheavy reliance on irrigation, increased fertilizer use, and crop residue burning, all of which have ", "46   Appendix 5 \na direct effect on the variable that most affects global climate change\u2014emission of greenhouse \ngases. It is estimated that the carbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent emissions from a high-input \n2\nconventionally tilled cropping system with residue burning and organic amendments would be 8 \nmillion milligrams (mg) of carbon (C) or 29 million mg CO /year if applied to the 1 million ha of \n2\nthe Indo-Gangetic Plains. In a no-till and residue-retained system, without burning, the pollution \nlevel is drastically reduced in time and space. The transition to intensified no-tillage systems \nreduces  weed  emergence  by  60%  in  year  1  and  hence,  reduces  herbicide  use;  reduces \nsequestered C, and reduces nitrogen (N) use. No-tillage systems, along with recommended \nfertilizer levels, can be both productive and environmentally sound in a world that is rapidly \nbecoming aware of the significant short- and long-term effects of global climate change. New \nresource-conserving technologies such as bed planting or even direct dry seeding can save 15\u2013\n40% of water use on farms and thus, lessen the problem of receding water tables in IGP. New \nwater-wise  strategies  can  help  conserve  rainwater,  improve  its  use,  and  improve  crop \nproductivity. \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n \n1.  Rationale \n \n8.  Despite tremendous gains in rice and wheat production over the past 40 years, the \ncontinued growth in population and pressure on the natural resource base place extreme stress \non  the  rice-wheat  system.  Additional  gains  in  productivity,  profit,  and  product  quality  are \nbecoming  increasingly  difficult  through  use  of  the  single-technology,  centric  approach. \nTherefore, a systems approach is necessary to increase the productivity of both rice and wheat \ncrops grown in sequence in IGP. \n \n9.  Past and ongoing studies on rice and wheat by IRRI, CIMMYT, and RWC partners, and \nwork  done  in  the  recently-completed  project  (RETA  5945)  have  produced  several  new \nstrategies and technologies that can ensure higher rural income, reduce drudgery, produce \ncheaper  food  for  the  urban  and  rural  poor,  and  offer  greater  environmental  protection. \nCollaborative research and training can strengthen the NARES. Currently, most rice-wheat \nfarmers, particularly in the eastern IGP, have limited access to new knowledge, technologies, \nand options that could help them achieve sustainable gains in production and improvements in \nlivelihoods. For the farmers, this \"knowledge gap\" results in low profitability, a poor standard of \nliving, and inadvertent environmental damage. Inefficient production also increases the cost to \nconsumers of the world's most important food staples, rice and wheat. There is a need to build \non the gains already made in the project (RETA 5945) on Sustaining the Rice-Wheat Production \nSystems of Asia by integrating all available rice and wheat production technologies, evaluating \nthem in farmers\u2019 fields, and promoting the successful technologies to farmers in general. There \nis  also  a  need  to  encourage  the  involvement  of  private  entrepreneurs  in  manufacturing, \nservices, and post-production management of goods and thus, help promote agribusiness in the \nregion.  \n \n2.  Purpose  and Output \n \n10.  The overall goal of the Project is to reduce rural poverty, improve farmers' livelihoods, \nand promote resource conservation in rice-based cropping systems in South Asia.

Methodologies and Key Activities \n   13.  The Project will focus on four countries\u23afBangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan\u23afin \nSouth Asia. These countries have substantial areas planted to rice and wheat. The Project will \ncontinue work at the five ongoing sites in the four countries in RETA 5945 (Kushtia-Chuadanga, \nBangladesh;  Patna-Varanasi  and  Karnal,  India;  Bhairahwa-Kotuynajay,  Nepal;  and  Lahore, \nPakistan). We also propose to scale up benefits in 6\u201310 villages/districts around a few selected \nsites. Lessons learned through RETA 5945 will be used to develop a strategy to target the \ntechnologies and scale up benefits obtained at the core sites. Early adopting farmers in strategic \nlocations will be used as demo farmers to inform and educate other farmers on the potential \nbenefits of adopting new technologies and practices. This will probably enhance farmer-to-\nfarmer education and the spread of information and technologies. Such technologies, when \ntargeted appropriately, are essentially scale-neutral and can work as well for small and marginal \nfarmers  as  for  the  relatively  larger  farmers  who  have  5\u201310  ha.  Emphasis  in  different ", "  Appendix 5  53 \nenvironments will include farmer-to-farmer education and seed exchange, enhancing resource \nuse  efficiency,  and  minimizing  adverse  environmental  effects  of  farming.  Also,  IRRI  and \nCIMMYT  and  their  NARES  partners  are  developing  complementary  activities  through  the \nongoing project Accelerating technology adoption to improve rural livelihoods in the rainfed \nEastern  Gangetic  Plains  (2003\u20132005),  funded  by  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment (IFAD). \n \n14.  Activities to examine the emerging priorities will be built into three subcomponents: \n \na.  Subcomponent  1.  Crop  Productivity  Enhancement  and  Efficient \nResource Use   \n15.  Technology options for producing more grain through efficient use of resources are \navailable, but have not yet been integrated into a systems approach and evaluated on farms. \nImproved  technologies  will  be  evaluated  for  worthiness  in  the  rice-wheat  systems  and  to \nformulate recommendations for upscaling for similar regions within the transects.  \n \n16.  Summary of Activities. Six to 10 villages/districts at each of the five sites in four \ncountries will be selected as focal areas to ensure an approach with tangible outputs and clear \nlessons learned for further dissemination. The methodology introduced and the national staff \ntrained will allow broader application of the principles and thus, greater impact. Initially, a \nparticipatory needs and opportunities assessment will be conducted to identify (i) known options \nto be tested in farmers' fields at focal sites, (ii) gaps requiring research for the development of \nsolutions,  and/or  (iii)  policy  interventions  to  be  targeted.  The  participatory  research  will \ndetermine the significance of individual factors under integrated crop management (ICM, the \nintegrated use of compatible technologies at the farm level for crop production, harvest, and \npostharvest  to  enhance  synergistic  benefits  to  farmers)  approach,  and  help  prioritize \ninterventions to enhance production efficiency and farmer profitability. Key target stakeholders \nwill play an important role in validating ICM options, and make suggestions on packaging and \npresenting the options for wider dissemination. Continued interaction with, and feedback from, \nfarmer-cooperators will allow assessment of advances in both profit and productivity. Such \npackaging of the interventions around an ICM framework will probably include information \ntechnology (IT) packaging\u23afa powerful new tool that allows greater capture of content. IRRI has \nexperience in this area with the development of Trop Rice\u23afan IT-based tool that captures key \npractical information on how to grow a rice crop. A similar concept for wheat will be evaluated.  \n \nb.  Subcomponent  2.  Post-Production  Management,  Product  Quality, \nand Diversification \n17.  The post-production part of the commodity chain will be analyzed to evaluate potential \ninterventions  for  grain  quality  improvement  in  relation  to  market  demand  and  consumer \npreferences.  Such  a  vertical  commodity  approach  will  allow  a  realistic  assessment  of \ndiversification  potential  and  processing  options.  Integral  parts  of  the  strategy  will  be  crop \ndiversification  and  intensification  while  resolving  conflicts  of  interest  between  farmers  and \nindustry, and finding alternate sources of productivity and income growth.  \n \n18.  Summary of Activities:  \n(i)  Crop production and post-production activities will be jointly analyzed, taking into \naccount the range of players involved, to identify and examine constraints and \npotential opportunities for improvement.  ", "54   Appendix 5 \n(ii)  Appropriate post-production technologies such as threshing, drying, storage, and \nmilling will be evaluated, refined, and promoted to improve product quality and \nbyproduct use.  \n(iii)  Potential interventions and/or incentives to change will be identified and used to \nmotivate the partners in production and post-production, and to enhance post-\nproduction management and product quality.  \n(iv)  Market analysis will be done to identify and promote suitable crop diversification \nand product mixes.  \n \nc.  Subcomponent 3. Capacity Building \n19.  The Project will train national collaborators in all steps of project implementation. Thus, \ninstitutional strengthening is expected at all levels. The two basic steps will be: \n(i)  Building human capacity. Determine human resource needs to support rice-\nwheat research and delivery and then enhance that capacity through training \n(including an appropriate mix of workshops and on-the-job, short-course, and \npost-graduate training) and, where appropriate, provide infrastructure.  \n(ii)  Access to rice-wheat literature. Upgrade the countries\u2019 literature on rice and \nwheat, and internet access to rice and wheat knowledge worldwide. \n \n20.  The  Project  will  also  monitor  and  quantify  the  impact  of  improved  technologies  on \nfarmers\u2019 income and livelihoods, the resource base, and efficiency of its use. The analysis will \nhelp sensitize national agricultural policymakers; extension services; public-, private-, and NGO-\nsector organizations; and farmer groups. The Project will also produce and disseminate new \nknowledge and science tools for managing and improving natural resources, and developing \nand perfecting new technologies.  \n \n21.  Linkages  and  Collaboration  with  Other  Projects.  Because  the  Project  aims  to \nintegrate available rice and wheat production technologies, evaluate them in farmers\u2019 fields, and \npromote the successful technologies widely to farmers, it will need to draw on the rich body of \nscientific  knowledge  and  products  generated  by  other  projects.  The  Project  will  use  the \nresearch-to-delivery continuum and draw on the enormous experience of IRRI and CIMMYT in \nintegrating resource-saving technologies for rice and wheat within the RW system. Linkages will \nbe made with several projects being, or expected to be, undertaken by IRRI, CIMMYT, RWC, \nand NARES. These include (i) an IFAD-funded project Accelerating technology adoption to \nimprove rural livelihoods in the rainfed Eastern Gangetic Plains (2003\u20132005), (ii) an ongoing \nADB-funded project on Integrating and mobilizing rice knowledge to improve and stabilize crop \nproductivity to achieve household food security in diverse and less-favorable rainfed areas of \nAsia (RETA 6136), (iii) an ongoing BMZ-funded project on Managing crop residues for healthy \nsoils  in  rice  ecosystems,  (iv)  an  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency-funded  technical \ncooperation project on Simulating water and nitrogen interactions in the rice-wheat cropping \nsystem, (v) a United States Agency for International Development-funded project for India on \nAccelerating  the  tillage  revolution  in  the  IGP:  fostering  adoption  of  resource-conserving \ntechnologies to promote economic growth and resource conservation, (vi) a Department for \nInternational Development-funded CAB International-CIMMYT project on Reaping the RCT\u2019s \nbenefits for impact, (vii) a comprehensive assessment on tillage and water, and (viii) a Europen \nUnion- project on Sharing knowledge and technologies. \n \n22.  Intellectual  Property  Issues.  Parties  participating  in  and  contributing  to  distinct \nresearch activities shall jointly own outputs resulting from the research, including all intellectual \nproperty rights. As such, they will remain in the public domain. The exchange and use of ", "  Appendix 5  55 \ngermplasm will be subject to the pertinent material transfer agreements that the participating \ncountries recognize. \n \n4.  Cost and Financing \n23.   The total cost of the Project, including contingencies, is estimated at $2.04 million. Table \nA5.2 gives details. It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $0.7 million to finance 34% of the \ntotal cost of the project. The remaining cost will be financed by IRRI ($435,000, or 21%), \nCIMMYT/RWC ($325,000, or 16%), and the DMCs ($577,000, or 28%). Of the $0.7 million \nrequested from ADB, 49% will go directly to NARES partners to implement site work; 11% to \nhire coordinators, purchase research supplies, and conduct NARES training; and the remainder \nto support travel and other activities of international agricultural research center (IARC) and \nRWC staff. \n \nTable A5.2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n ($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

IRRI, having a long experience in implementing ADB RETA activities, has a unique role \nas  the  world's  leading  rice  research  institute  focused  on  helping  developing  countries, \nparticularly in South Asia. IRRI, an RWC active member, has dynamic collaboration with all the \nmajor rice- and wheat-growing nations of Asia, and with sister international institutions in the \nregion. \n \n25.  The Project will be implemented in close collaboration with the RWC/CIMMYT  and \nNARES.  \n \n26.  IRRI  will  submit  the  following  reports  to  ADB:  (i)  inception  reports,  (ii)  semiannual \nprogress reports, (iii) semiannual financial statements accounting for use of project funds, (iv) \naudited annual financial statements, and (v) a comprehensive completion report. The inception \nreport will be submitted within 3 months from the start of the Project; the semiannual progress \nreports and financial statements, every 6 months; and the comprehensive completion report, \nwithin 3 months of project closure.  \n \n27.  The RWC,3 a NARES-led and -driven initiative in which the Consortium decides the role \nof  IARCs  and  other  partners,  is  a  multi-tiered  organization  with  the  Regional  Steering \nCommittee  (RSC)  the  main  management  group  for  endorsing  the  research  themes  and \napproving work plans developed by the Regional Technical Coordination Committee (RTCC) \nand budgets. The NARES are majority members of the RSC, which consists of the director \ngeneral of each of the four participating NARES (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan), the \ndirector generals of both IRRI and CIMMYT, and a donor representative. The chair of RSC \nrotates annually among heads of the four NARES, and is currently chaired by Dr. Badaruddin \nSoomro, executive director, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council. Regional technical issues \nare deliberated at the RTCC, which comprises senior partner scientists, national coordinators, \nsite coordinators, and relevant scientists of Consultative Group on International Agricultural \nResearch  (CGIAR centers. There are national steering and technical committees in each \nparticipating country, and site coordinators and teams at the key sites. \n \n28.  The mechanism of implementation in RETA 5945 will be followed. Stakeholders involved \nin  implementing  the  Project  include  farmers,  service  providers,  traders,  millers, \npublic/NGO/private extension staff, researchers, and media people. Annual meetings of key \nstakeholders will be organized in each country to present and discuss project progress and to \nplan, discuss, and agree on activities for the next year. Successful farmers\u2019 experiences will be \nconveyed  to  fellow  farmers  through  field  demonstrations,  farmers\u2019  days  at  harvest  time, \npublications, media broadcasts, newsletters and leaflets about successful technologies, and \nfarmer-to-farmer exchange of locally important project news items.  \n \n29.

", "  Appendix 5  57 \na whole. The Project focuses on both well-endowed and resource-poor farmers. Sustainability of \nproduction for both groups of farmers is essential to eliminate poverty. Intensive well-endowed \nareas will help produce cheap food for rural landless laborers, the poorest of the poor who must \nspend much of their income to buy food. Improved sustainability in these areas will also reduce \nthe  pressure  to  expand  cultivation  into  marginal  lands.  Resource-poor  farmers  will  benefit \ndirectly through increased profits or a reduced need to purchase food. The products will result in  \n(i)  accelerated adoption of double zero-tillage in the rice/wheat system, \n(ii)  income security and higher profit at the farm level,  \n(iii)  protected food supplies at affordable prices for both the rural and urban poor,  \n(iv)  production stability and thus, lower risk for producers,  \n(v)  reduced drudgery for producers,  \n(vi)  improved environment and maintenance of the natural resource base for society \nas a whole, \n(vii)  enhanced national research and development capacity to ensure a system that is \nsustainable and integrated, and that involves an effective network of research \nand relevant civil societies/organizations, and  \n(viii)  enhanced partnerships with local organizations to ensure that the needs of the \nrural poor are met, and that products of research are suitable and made readily \navailable to all. \n \n31.  Rice-wheat research to increase site-specific productivity and sustainability supported by \nADB  through  RETA  5945  in  the  four  RWC  countries  has  made  remarkable  progress  in \nsuccessfully  evaluating  resource-conserving  technologies  for  the  system.  Promising \ntechnologies  include  land  leveling,  zero-tillage,  bed  planting,  surface  seeding,  and  deep \nplacement  and  plant  need-based  application  of  fertilizers.  Traditional  transplanted  rice  on \npuddled soil required 24 or more irrigations/season. With a mean time of 10 hours/irrigation per \nha, the total pumping hours/ha per season were 244. The past 2 years of on-farm work have \nshown that zero-till transplanted rice on flat land or transplanted rice on beds reduced the total \npumping hours by 15% to 40%/ha per season. Similarly, direct-seeded rice on beds reduced the \ntotal pumping hours/season by 37%. Farmers\u2019 interest in these water-saving technologies is \nincreasing, as shown by their increased adoption in the past 2 years of implementation of RETA \n5945: zero-tillage technology has increased from 300 ha to more than 200,000 ha; bed planting, \nfrom 500 to 3,000 ha; and surface seeding, from 1,000 to10,000 ha. These successes show \nenormous future potential impact. Likewise, plant need-based N management using the leaf \ncolor chart (LCC) has shown that at least a 25% application rate of N can be saved without \nreducing rice yield. As an example, benefits from two technologies\u23afzero tillage and LCC-based \nN management\u23afwere estimated. It was found that the ex ante impact of proposed investments \nin terms of economic value would be $55 million in just the wheat season if zero-tillage were \npracticed  on  1  million  ha.  The  benefits  estimated  would  be  $2  million  if  LCC-based  N \nmanagement were practiced on 1 million ha. If 1 million ha of \u201crice fallow lands\u201d in the eastern \nIGP could be reduced and diverted to winter maize, potato, or other suitable crops, an estimated \n10 million tons of additional food could be produced where most poor people reside. Productivity \nof the rainfed fertile meander islands could be increased substantially to promote livelihoods of \ndairy farmers and save at least 50% in seed costs (the seed rates that farmers use\u2014100 kg/ha \nto 140 kg/ha for lentils and chickpea\u2014are extraordinarily high).  \n \n32.  Large-scale  adoption  of  resource-conserving  technologies  will  have  considerable \nenvironmental benefits. Improved fertilizer and residue management will reduce emissions of \npotent greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, and nitrate pollution of \ngroundwater. Zero-tillage technology is energy-efficient. Adoption of zero tillage on 1 million ha \ncould save as much as 100 million cubic meters of water/year, plus 60 million liters of diesel ", "58   Appendix 5 \n(which would reduce CO emissions considerably).  The farming communities of the project area \n2 \nwill learn new methods of managing farms and resources, will have new knowledge, and will be \nempowered to make informed decisions for managing natural resources. Farmer involvement in \ntraveling seminars of the ongoing RETA 5945 has provided an excellent mechanism to improve \nfarmers\u2019 convictions and confidences in resource-conserving technologies.  \n \n33.  Potential Constraints. Attaining an effective level of coordination for interdisciplinary \nand inter-institutional collaborative research is among the biggest challenges for the Project, \nespecially because team members are from different countries and subject to many other \ndemands on their professional time from their institutions. The policy environment must be \nfavorable and market outlets well developed to promote farmer adoption of RCTs. The RWC \nmechanism is designed to facilitate collaboration and to influence policies in the best possible \nway.  \n \n1.  Monitoring Plan \n34.  The initial project work plan will be developed in close consultation with partners in \ndifferent countries. The planned activities are in accordance with the RWC work plans that were \napproved by the technical coordination and steering committees. Project partners will meet \nannually to review progress and to adjust/update the work plan. Site coordinators will convene \nto monitor progress and make mid-course corrections. Joint development and acceptance of the \nGantt chart and periodic internal reporting will help keep implementation on schedule and \nproduce outputs on time. Major milestones will be identified for assessing social, economic, and \nenvironmental outcomes, and will be indicated in the jointly agreed-upon Gantt chart for follow \nup. \n \n35.  A team of the ADB nominated staff will be invited to annual meetings of the RWC \ntechnical committee, followed by field visits to the experimental sites. These visits and meetings \nwill provide ample opportunities for the ADB coordinator to interact with site coordinators from \neach country, and see actual implementation of the work at each site and its impact on the \nlivelihoods of participating farmers. Also, ADB staff will be invited to attend the cross-country \ntraveling seminars organized for scientists, extensionists, private entrepreneurs, and farmers.    \n \n2.  Personnel \n36.  The  rice-wheat  coordinator  and  senior  soil  scientist  from  IRRI  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for managing the project. He will be assisted by two Project Coordinators for the \neastern  and  northwestern  IGP,  respectively,  who  will  be  hired  under  this  TA  for  full-time \nadministration and coordination of the entire project. The Regional Facilitator of the RWC will \nalso lend support to project management and execution. \n \n37.  Core work of the Project will be carried out by the research teams at the five sites. Most \nof research personnel will be employed staff of the NARES institutions, IRRI, CIMMYT, and the \nRWC (Table A5.3). In some cases, as indicated, additional project staff will be hired under this \nTA for implementing the work on-site.

Introduction \n1.  The breakup of the former Soviet Union (FSU) led to emergence of five independent \nstates  in  Central  Asia  that  are  in  transition  to  market  based  economies:  Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  Economic reforms are occurring at \nvarying rates with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan pursuing rapid transition policies, \nwhile Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan follow more cautious approaches. Before independence, \nthe Central Asian economies were interdependent upon a centrally managed Soviet economy. \nEach republic was agriculturally specialized according to agroclimatic zones, with production \nand marketing distributed throughout the entire Soviet trade system. After the FSU breakup, the \ncollapse of existing trade arrangements, and the abolition of subsidies, the agriculture sector \ncontracted significantly, and agricultural output dropped by about 50%. Consequently, these \nnewly independent states were left with the task of developing independent market economies. \n \n2.  Intensive irrigated agriculture in the Aral Sea Basin expanded rapidly during the FSU \nera, resulted in significant increases in food and fiber production and made agriculture the \nbackbone of the economies of these Central Asian republics, contributing more than 25% of \ntheir  gross domestic  products  and  employing  about  45%  of  the  workforce.  In  rural  areas, \nirrigated agriculture and the processing of agricultural products was, and remains, by far the \nmain source of employment and income. \n \n3.  Over-exploitation  of  water  and  soil  resources  in  the  region,  however,  along  with \ndesertification of the Aral Sea and damage to the delta systems, has caused serious economic, \nsocial, and environmental problems. Declining agronomic productivity, along with salinization \nand elevated water tables, has contributed to endemic poverty in rural agrarian communities. \n \n4.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will promote the development of innovative \ntechnologies that enhance the productivity and income-generation opportunities of rural farmers \nthrough effective management of saline soils and water. The Project will address poverty and \nimprove food security at the household level through increasing productivity of irrigated farming \nsystems and enhancing the capacity of the national agriculture research and extension systems \n(NARES) to promote and deliver effective land and water management strategies to farmers.  \nEffects of land and water degradation are extreme, compromising household food security and \nincome generation, in the proposal targets: Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n \nB.  Issues and Constraints \n5.  Conditions  for  crop  production  in  the  Central  Asian  republics  have  deteriorated \nsignificantly. High salinity levels and rising water tables in large areas of irrigated land have led \nto crop yield losses of more than 30%. Salinization affects 47.5% of the irrigated land in Central \nAsia,  ranging  from  95.9%  in  Turkmenistan  to  11.5%  in  Kyrgyzstan.  In  the  Central  Asian \nrepublics, 289,000 hectares are affected by medium to high salinity levels.  Declining agronomic \nproductivity associated with salinization and elevated water tables has contributed to endemic \npoverty in agrarian communities.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix  6  61 \n6.  Enhancing  Adoption  of  Innovative  Strategies  to  Address  Land  and  Water \nDegradation. Although the region faces enormous challenges in preventing, mitigating, and \nreversing  degradation  of  soil  and  water  resources,  there  is  cause  for  cautious  optimism. \nIndividuals,  households,  and  small  communities  have  adopted  innovative  practices  and \nstrategies  to  reverse  resource  degradation  in  a  sustainable  manner  while  maintaining  or \nenhancing food security and income generation. These have been termed \u201cbright spots,\u201d and \nhave  been  documented  in  collaborative  research  of  the  International  Water  Management \nInstitute  (IWMI)  and  the  Tashkent  Institute  of  Irrigation  and  Agricultural  Mechanization \nEngineers (Ul-Hassan et al., 20041). For example, farmers have developed coping strategies \nthat include simple changes in farming practices such as ensuring timely agricultural operations, \nusing organic soil amendments, maintaining water infrastructure, and use of wastelands for crop \ndiversification. These practices, combined with innovative coping strategies to enhance cash \nflow, have resulted in higher crop yields, higher profits, and improved farm resource conditions. \nThese \u201cbright spots\u201d clearly indicate the potential of individuals and communities to overcome \nthe current inhibitory policies, which are market barriers. Such improvements are possible for \nmany  more  farms.  Integration  of  these  \u201cbright  spots\u201d    into  current  policy  and  institutional \nstructures is a unique opportunity. The challenge is to develop innovative ways to extend these \n\u201cbright spots\u201d to more individuals and communities. \n \n7.  Increasing Productivity and Income Generation While Reversing Soil and Water \nDegradation. Excessive salt levels in soils inhibit crop growth. The main approach to remedy \nthe problem has been to apply large amounts of water, to leach salts below the root zone. From \n20 to 25% of the annual available surface water in the region has been estimated to be used to \nleach these salts. That water could otherwise be delivered to the Aral Sea. Application of \nexcessive water causes elevated water tables and will, in the medium term, cause further salt \nintrusion  and  increase  the  risk  of  waterlogging.  Construction  of  vertical  and/or  horizontal \ndrainage systems would help remove excess water from fields, but costs of such infrastructure \nconstruction, management, and operation over extensive areas are prohibitive. Technologically, \nand  from  a  management  perspective,  a  range  of  forages,  field  crops,  and  medicinal  and \naromatic plants have shown the potential to grow on salt-affected soils. Several of these species \ncan potentially play a significant role in biodrainage, which removes excess water by vegetation, \nrather than mechanical means. Based on a selection of plant species, production systems, crop \nand irrigation management systems, and socioeconomics of farming communities, there is a \nneed to identify and expand these successes from communities to regions and river basins. \n \n8.  Enhancing  Capacity  within  NARS  and  Causing  Institutional  Change.  Although \nseveral Central Asian countries are adopting integrated land and water resources management, \nmost are still constrained by obsolete institutional legacies of the Soviet and \u201ctechnocratic \nimprovement\u201d  eras.  These  include  over-sized  bureaucracies  with  low  productivity  and \naccountability, highly fragmented and sectorized agencies based on administrative rather than \nresource or environmental boundaries, poor coordination, and a chronic inability to mobilize \nsufficient resources for water resource development and management. Inadequate legislation, \ncontradictory policies, and a lack of capacity in community organizations to manage water \nresources at local levels helps make many Central Asian countries ill-suited to implement \nintegrated  land  and  water  resources  management.  The  need  is  clear  to  address  these \ndeficiencies through institutional capacity building and changing restrictive policies. \n                                                 \n1  Ul-Hassan, M., Noble, A. D., and Kazbekov, J. 2004. \u201cBright Spots\u201d in Uzbekistan, reversing land and water \ndegradation while improving livelihoods: Key development and sustaining ingredients for slow transition economies \nof  the  Former  Soviet  Union.  Comprehensive  Assessment  Research  Report.  Comprehensive  Assessment \nSecretariat, Colombo, Sri Lanka. (In Press). ", "62  Appendix 6 \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Rationale \n9.  More than 16 km3 of irrigation return flow is discharged back into the Amu Darya and Syr \nDaryr river systems in the upper and middle reaches of the basins. This has dramatic impacts \non  the  quality  of  water  (i.e.,  salt  levels)  that  reaches  tail  end  users,  contributing  to  high \nsalinization in irrigated fields. Through a process of decreasing both diversion for, and return \nflows from, irrigation within the upper and middle regions of the basin that are currently being \nused  for  leaching  salts,  water  quality  for  tail  end  users,  and  environmental  flows,  will  be \nimproved.  \n \n10.  The availability of irrigation water is critical for improving productivity in most Central \nAsian states because the climate is generally dry and droughts are frequent. But water use \nefficiency  remains  low  because  irrigation  systems  are  poorly  maintained  and  irrigation \ntechnologies are inappropriate, causing soil salinity and waterlogging. Thus the need is urgent \nfor  water-saving  technologies,  and  for  options  for  sustainable  use  of  other  available,  but \nmarginal quality, water resources by developing improved and innovative farming systems. \n \n11.  The Fergana Valley Project, sponsored by the International Water Management Institute \nand State Industrial Corporation of Sri Lanka clearly demonstrated that strong institutional \nstructures, such as water users associations (WUA) and federations, must be established to \nmitigate soil salinity associated with irrigation systems on a meso-scale. The move toward \nprivatization and reduced farm sizes in Central Asia requires involvement of all stakeholders, \nincluding local farmer organizations and WUAs, water managers, and key decision makers in \nthe adoption of improved technologies to address secondary salinity. Key to such changes is \ncreating awareness and capacity building at all levels of governance. \n \n12.  Considering these factors IWMI, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the \nDry  Areas  (ICARDA),  and  the  International  Center  for  Biosaline  Agriculture  (ICBA),  in \npartnership  with  key  national  institutions,  have  demonstrated  that  appropriate  water \nmanagement techniques and soil conservation practices can significantly increase agricultural \nproductivity and income generation. The proposed project will use results from these activities \nand develop additional strategies to reverse the existing downward spiral of hopelessness by \nresearching innovative income-generating strategies that make use of problematic water and \nsoils. \n \n2.  Purpose and Output  \n13.  The overall objectives of the proposed TA are to address poverty, improve food security \nat the household level, and enhance environmental security by developing, promoting, and \nadopting strategies that enhance the productivity of existing irrigated farming systems in Central \nAsia. The immediate objective of the proposed project is the development and farmer adoption \nof innovative technologies that enhance productivity and income generation opportunities for \ndisadvantaged rural farmers through the effective management of problematic saline soils and \nwater, and to change resource and agricultural management policies. To this end, the Project \nhas the following objectives: \n(i)  Identify  and  promote  the  expansion  of  community-based  innovations  termed \n\u2018\u201dbright spots\u201d that prevent further land and water degradation and enhance the \nlivelihoods of agrarian communities.

Methodology and Key Activities  \n15.  The  proposed  project  will  address  specific  problems  associated  with  the  economic \nutilization of saline soils. An inception workshop will be held at the start of the Project to finalize \nannual work plans for its duration and to distribute key tasks among the partners. Project \nimplementation will be within the framework of three integrated components in Kazakhstan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan: \n \na.  Identification, Promotion, and Adoption of Innovative Practices to \nPrevent Further Land and Water Degradation in the Aral Sea Basin \n16.

IWMI will lead this \ncomponent, and achieve its objectives through: \n(i)  Documentation of existing \u201cbright spots\u201d that address land and water degradation \nissues through comparative research and a framework of lessons learned. A \n\u201crapid appraisal methodology\u201d will be used to document existing \u201cbright spots\u201d in \nKazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, using locally trained enumerators \n(Table A6.1, Output 1.1). \n(ii)  A comprehensive database will be developed jointly with relevant NARES and \nfully housed in the ministries of agriculture and water resources of each of the \nthree target Central Asian governments. This will be an interactive database that \nwill allow the input of further \u201cbright spot\u201d cases based on the current IWMI \nwebsite (www.iwmi.org/brightspots) (Table A6.1, Output 1.1).  \n(iii)  Through  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  development  of  \u201cbright  spots,\u201d  a \nframework  and  methodology  will  be  developed  that  will  assist  in  their \ndevelopment and promotion. The outcome of this activity will be a manual on \nHow to Create Bright Spots for Addressing Land and Water Degradation (Table \nA6.1, Output 1.2).   \n(iv)  Well-tested social mobilization methodologies, currently used in Central Asia by \nIWMI along with local partners, will be used to organize selected communities. \nThrough collective action within these communities a methodology that enhances \nthe adoption of \u201cbright spots\u201d will be developed (Table A6.1, Output 1.2).

These studies will focus on identifying appropriate \nmethods of crop establishment and possible soil remediation, based on field \ntrials.  \n(iii)  Assessment of irrigation management strategies aimed at maintaining root zone \nsalinity  within  acceptable  levels  while  lowering  water  tables  by  considering \nirrigation water quality and quantity, crop water requirements, leaching fractions, \nand  irrigation  scheduling.  This  will  be  achieved  through  field  studies  and \nsupplemented  by  a  modeling  platform  (i.e.  Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant \n[SWAP])  and  field  observations  using  piezometers  (Table  A6.1,  Output  2.2, \nICARDA and IWMI) \n(iv)  A comprehensive assessment of the socioeconomic environment to facilitate the \nadoption  of  alternative  cropping  strategies.  This  will  focus  on  evaluating \neconomic returns, market development, and community acceptance based on \nsurveys and quantitative production estimates (Table A6.1, Output 2.3, ICARDA)  \n(v)  By  analyzing  temporal  satellite  images,  develop  crop  coefficients  to  indicate \nlevels  of  crop  stress  associated  with  salinity.  This  will  be  validated  through \nselective  ground  testing  and  associated  laboratory  analyses  of  soil  samples \n(Table A6.1, Output 2.4, IWMI). \n \nc.  Capacity Building and Dissemination  \n18.  The capacity of farmers and NARES will be strengthened through full involvement in the \ndesign and implementation of project activities. On-farm testing of promising technologies and \nannual field days will help disseminate project results. Local language manuals, extension \nreleases, and guidelines will be produced and made available to farmers. NARES scientists will \nundergo both informal and formal training, and will be encouraged to disseminate research \nresults at international workshops and conferences. IWMI and ICARDA will jointly lead this \ncomponent, with ICBA support. Specific activities follow.  \n(i)  Farmers\u2019  and  community  capacities  will  be  strengthened  through  their  full \ninvolvement in project activities. Field days will be organized for \u201clearning by \nseeing\u201d so that lessons from successful \u201cbright spots\u201d associated with improved \nsoil and water management can be widely shared among farmers in similar \nenvironmental and socioeconomic conditions. This will also include roundtable \npolicy briefings (Table A6.1, Output 3.1, IWMI and ICARDA). \n(ii)  Research  findings  will  be  disseminated  through  simple  brochures  in  local \nlanguages, policy briefs to the national governments, organizing joint field visits \nwith policy makers, and through an annual project workshop that local media will \ncover (Table A6.1, Outputs 3.1 and 3.4, ICARDA and IWMI). \n(iii)  Partner communities will be fully involved in all activities of establishing and \nmanaging  farmers\u2019  organizations,  on-farm  testing  of  promising  technologies, \ncommunity-centered field days, and workshops (Table A6.1, Outputs 3.1 and 3.3, \nIWMI, and ICARDA). \n(iv)  Simple  manuals  on  sustainable  land  and  water  management,  salinity  and \nsodicity, managing return-flows, and organizational and business management \nwill be published and disseminated in local languages (Table A6.1, Output 3.3, \nICARDAand IWMI). ", "  Appendix  6  67 \n(v)  Specialized trainings in water and land management will be held for NARES \n(Table A6.1, Output 3.3), IWMI, ICARDA, and ICBA). \n(vi)  The  capacity  of  university  students  in  research  on  land  and  water  resource \ndegradation  and  geographical  information  systems/remote  sensing  will  be \nenhanced  through  involvement  of  postgraduate  students  in  selected  project \nactivities (Table A6.1, Outputs 3.2 and 3.3, IWMI and ICARDA). \n \n4.  Cost and Financing  \n19.      The cost of the proposed project is estimated at $1.34 million over 3 years. ADB is \nrequested to provide $700,000 equivalent, or about 52% of the cost. The balance will be \nsourced  through  in-kind  contributions  of  IWMI,  ICARDA,  and  ICBA  of  $615,900  and  by \nparticipating NARS, of $23,800.

Implementation Arrangements  \n20.  IWMI will manage the Project. It will be implemented jointly by IWMI, ICARDA, ICBA, \nand the NARES (i.e. Central Asia Research Institute of Irrigation (SANIIRI), Uzbekistan; the \nInstitute of Water Economy, Kazakhstan; and the Ministry of Agriculture, Turkmenistan. The \nproject steering committee, comprising representatives of IWMI, ICARDA, ICBA, each \u201cnational \nprogram focal point\u201d and donors will oversee project progress. In each target country, research \nteams  will  be  established  and  project  management  will  appoint  national  scientists  on  a \nsecondment  or  consultancy  basis.  The  project  manager  will  oversee  development  and \nimplementation of work plans, coordinate research and training activities, and coordinate and \nprepare annual and technical reports in consultation with national scientists. Collaboration with \nuniversities will be on an assigned basis in order to mobilize post-graduate students and field \nteams. Country members of the International Fund for the Aral Sea and the United Nations \nConvention tom Combat Desertification will be invited to participate and provide inputs in design \nand implementation at annual project meetings. Under the TA, 66 person-months of three local \nconsultants (social scientists); 66 person-months for one soil scientist; 33 person-months for \nhydrotechnician; and 36 person-months of GIS will be engaged. \n ", "  Appendix  6  69 \n21.  The Project will start with an inception workshop where all stakeholders finalize project \nactivities and work plans. Meetings on regional technical research coordination and planning will \nbe held annually in each country, where annual reports and results will be presented, and plans \nfor the next year agreed upon. At the Project\u2019s end, a final workshop will be held to review \nprogress, and coordinate actions to ensure the Project\u2019s sustainability.  \n \n22.  IWMI must submit the following reports to ADB: (i) inception reports, (ii) semiannual \nprogress reports, (iii) semiannual financial statements accounting for use of project funds, (iv) \naudited annual financial statements, and (v) a comprehensive completion report. The inception \nreport will be submitted within 3 months from the start of the Project, the semiannual progress \nreports and financial statements every 6 months, and the comprehensive completion report \nwithin 3 months of project closure. \n \n23.  The Project will seek opportunities for large-scale replication of project recommendations \nthrough mobilization of additional resources from development programs in the region, funded \nby ADB and other organizations. \n \n24.  IWMI  will  procure  goods  and  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \nD.  Potential Project Impact \n25.  Relationship of the Project to ADB Priorities. The proposed project contributes to all \nsix ADB priorities for agricultural and natural resources research. The development of innovative \npractices  and  new  cropping  systems  for  the  management  of  saline  soils  and  water  will \ncontribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in vulnerable rural communities \nthrough  community-led,  efficient,  inexpensive,  environmentally  feasible,  and  sustainable \nremediation in the Aral Sea Basin.  \n \n26.  Environmental  Benefits.  The  utilization  of  saline  waters  at  generation  points  will \nsignificantly decrease pressure on limited freshwater resources, thereby allowing increases of \nflow in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river systems, along with improving the quality of water \ndelivered to downstream users and, ultimately, the Aral Sea. In the medium-term, this will have \npositive impacts on the health and well-being of participating communities through improved \nstandards of living. The proposed approach will help prevent further expansion of salt-affected \nsoils and will, in the long-term, facilitate their remediation. \n \n27.  Social and Economic Benefits. The Project will help increase productivity of saline \nsoils and water through increased yields and crop diversification. This will significantly stabilize \nproductivity of these problem soils and hence, increase income generation. When farmers can \nenhance productivity using adaptive cropping systems and improved management practices, \nthere will be less pressure to abandon land and expand into marginal areas, thus reducing the \nrisk of environmental degradation. Furthermore, farmer participatory involvement in the Project \nthrough on-farm testing will increase adoption of improved cropping systems and management \npractices, leading to improved production, and enhanced income generation and livelihood \nsecurity. \n \n \n \n ", "70  Appendix 6 \n28.  Potential for Adoption. The participatory approach in the development of \u201cbright spots\u201d \nand in assessment of improved cropping systems and management practices will empower \nrural communities to select appropriate practices that suit their needs. The Project's focus on \ndeliberately influencing policy makers will help facilitate adoption of improved management \nstrategies. \n \n29.  Potential Constraints. Some risk is always associated with the introduction of new \ncropping systems and farming practices that are outside the status quo. Incorporation of new \nplant species into farming systems is particularly and strongly influenced by farmers\u2019 readiness \nfor change. But by maintaining a close working partnership with farmers, the NARES and policy \nmakers can minimize such risks. Successful adoption of new crops and cropping systems could \nbe constrained by restrictive national policies and availability of markets for new agricultural \nproduce. The Project includes activities to develop marketing plans to determine consumer \nacceptability and market opportunities. This task is challenging, because markets may not \ninitially respond positively, because of uncertainties, state restrictions, and implications for future \ntrade. The potential for market development will be assessed and interventions to minimize the \nrisks to stakeholders will be selected. \n \n1.  Monitoring Plan  \n30.  A three-level monitoring plan is proposed: (i) compliance with project protocols during \nimplementation, (ii) quality of project outputs, and (iii) progress to achieving project goals. The \ntechnical  assistance  framework  (Table  A6.1)  gives  quantifiable  performance  indicators  and \ntargets. In brief, project performance will be monitored through: (i) the execution, progress, and \nresults of field trials from different sites according to the project plan and fulfillment of agreed \nresponsibilities by different stakeholders, to be presented in regular progress reports; (ii) the \nquality and relevance of project outputs, measured by acceptance and adoption of project \nrecommendations  by  target  farming  communities  by  monitoring  the  number  of  farmers \nparticipating in, and adopting, concepts and technologies associated with project \u201cbright spots\u201d \nand peer-reviewed publications; (iii) achievement of the project goal of poverty  alleviation, \nincluding food security and environmental sustainability. Achievement of the latter goal will be \nestablished  through  periodic  surveys  in  selected  areas  to  measure  improved  productivity, \nquantified by farm production; and environmental effects, assessed by changes in soil and \nwater salinity, groundwater level and composition, and budgets for irrigation and drainage. \nBaseline figures of key statistics for longer- term evaluation will be recorded for post-project \nimpact evaluation. \n \n2.  Personnel  \n31.  IWMI will manage the Project through the project leader in Tashkent.

Introduction \n1.  Agriculture  provides  home  and  livelihood  to  most  of  the  poor  in  rural  Asia.  Thus, \nimproving agriculture and natural resources is critical to any poverty reduction efforts. On this \npremise  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  invested  in  agricultural  research  and \ndevelopment for almost three decades and has harnessed the knowledge and expertise of the \ninternational  agricultural  research  centers  (IARCs)  to  help  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs) with technologies, planting materials, and training. Since 1995, ADB has provided grant \nfunds  to  the  IARCs  through  an  umbrella  regional  technical  assistance  of  about  $4-$5 \nmillion/year. But this assistance has been declining in the last few years, largely because of \nincreased competition for limited grant funds within ADB. It is imperative, therefore, that work of \nthe IARCs be seen in the context of the countries\u2019 and region\u2019s priorities and programs, and that \nthe linkage between their outputs and ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction be clearly \npresented.  \n \n2.  Efforts  to  streamline  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  agricultural  research  began  with  the \npreparation of background papers on funding agricultural research and discussions among the \nmembers of the Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development Sector Committee. \nOutcomes of the meetings were presented to all regional directors of agriculture, environment, \nand natural resources, to seek their views and develop a strategy to enhance the quality and \nfocus of the IARCs\u2019 work and the synergy between it and priorities of the countries, the region, \nand ADB. One decision of these deliberations was that detailed guidelines should be prepared \nto reflect ADB\u2019s expectations from IARCs in project preparation, implementation, impact, and \nfollow-up.  These  guidelines  were  formulated,  reviewed,  and  finalized  in  March  2003,  and \ncirculated to the IARCs, with the approval of the director general of Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department. \n \nB.  Issues and Constraints \n3.  Previous meetings among the agriculture, environment, and natural resources divisions \nhad indicated a strong need for greater interaction among the IARCs, the national agricultural \nresearch systems (NARS), and ADB to ensure that research activities funded by ADB regional \ntechnical assistance (RETAs) reflect the sector priorities of the region and the output of efforts is \nlinked with national programs and ADB\u2019s operational portfolios. The Eighth Regional Technical \nAssistance Program of ADB for the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research \n(RETA 6136) included a project to enhance the effectiveness of investments in agricultural \nresearch  for  development  in  Central  and  South  Asia.  The  project  conducted  two  regional \nworkshops, co-hosted by the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas in \nTashkent, Uzbekistan, 23\u201325 August and by the International Crops Research Institute for the \nSemi-Arid Tropics in New Delhi, India, 1\u20133 September 2004. \n \n4.  Research and new technologies are an integral part of agriculture growth and strategies \nin most DMCs, yet there is little institutionalized interaction among governments, international \nfinancial  institutions,  development  and  extension  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), and national and international research organizations who share the primary goal of \npoverty  alleviation.  The  proposed  forum  will  provide  all  stakeholders  and  actors  in  the \nagriculture sector an opportunity to explore opportunities to build linkages in future operations.  ", "  Appendix 7  73 \n5.  Effective  investment  in  research  and  development  in  the  sector  requires  efficient \ncoordination  among  all  actors  in  planning,  programming,  resource  allocation,  and \nimplementation.  This  is  difficult  because  it  involves  many  stakeholders  including  farmers, \ncountry sector planners, national and international funding agencies, national and international \nresearch  organizations,  development  and  extension  services,  private  input  suppliers, \nconsultants and traders, and national and international NGOs. Barriers to collaboration can be \nspatial (e.g., local, national, international), professional (e.g., research, extension, development \norientation), social (e.g., government vs. NGOs) and economic (e.g., public vs. private). \n \n6.  There are many examples of effective coordination and collaboration within groups of \nstakeholders (for example, between national and international research organizations). It is \nmore difficult to find examples of effective cooperation among different groups of stakeholders \n(for example, between country planners and NGOs), or between researchers and development \nprojects. The proposed workshops with IARCs and country stakeholders in common forums are \nexpected to yield feedback and provide an opportunity for discussing possible improvements \nand new directions. \n \n7.  To address these needs, regional forums on agriculture and natural resources research \nare  proposed  to  facilitate  discussion,  dissemination,  and  collaboration  among  national  and \ninternational  agricultural  research  centers  and  country  sector  planners.  The  forums  are \nexpected to enhance understanding and use of the work being done by research institutions, \nfacilitate greater information sharing among all research and development partners, and build \ncollaboration and synergy in the work programs. The workshops will present the added benefits \nof identifying opportunities for incorporating the RETA findings into ADB\u2019s regional and country \nprograms.  \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The overall project goal is to identify practical options for more effective collaboration \nand information exchange among stakeholders in agricultural sector planning, research, and \ndevelopment. The specific purposes of the Project are (i) to elaborate on some of the problems \nthat stakeholders face when promoting partnerships and linkages; (ii) to present and analyze \ncase studies of successful cooperation among stakeholders, and identify which linkages could \nbe added; and (iii) to identify options for strengthening partnerships, and develop a plan of \naction to implement them.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To start this effort in 2005, it is proposed that two regional forums under the ninth RETA \nbe established and activated: one forum in the Mekong Region and the other in Southeast Asia. \nWorkshops will be organized in the two regions to bring the key sector operators on one \nplatform to promote dialogue and information flow among the national policy and program \nplanners, NARS, IARCs, donors, and other financial institutions. The workshops are expected to \nhighlight  significant  achievements,  benefits,  and  contributions  of  agricultural  research  and \nstrengthen the commitment to promote partnerships and linkages among all stakeholders. The \ntwo  regional  workshops  will  bring  together  representatives  of  the  key  stakeholder  groups \ninvolved in agriculture and natural resources research and development in these regions to \nanalyze relationships among stakeholder groups (within countries and regions) in terms of \ninformation flows, decision-making processes, feedback mechanisms and cooperation; identify \ngaps  in  the  processes;  and  suggest  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term options  for improving \ninteraction and cooperation among stakeholders. This regional approach will generate a range \nof options for action at the national level. The identified options from the two workshops will be \nsynthesized  and  disseminated  widely.  The  TA  will  support  these  meetings,  fund  two \ninternational  and  one  domestic  consultants  to  provide  advisory  and  technical  secretariat \nservices  before  and  during  the  forums,  and  finance  the  publication  and  dissemination  of \nworkshop materials. ADB will take the lead for the program, and the organization and conduct of \nthe workshops.  \n \n10.  Table A7.2 describes the workshop process. Each workshop will be 2.5 days long, with \nabout  35  to  40  participants.  Expected  outputs  include:  (i)  a  map  of  linkages  among  key \nstakeholders; (ii) analyses of strong and weak linkages, information flows, priority settings, and ", "76  Appendix 7 \nresource allocations; (iii) identification of existing projects and initiatives with strong linkages \nacross stakeholder groups; (iv) options to ensure effective linkages between stakeholders; and \n(v) agenda and responsibilities for the next steps. \n \nTable A7.2: Workshop Process \n \nPhase  Activities  Outputs  Expected Outcomes \nIdentify Issues  Identify key stakeholders in host  List of key stakeholders  Increased awareness by \ncountries    stakeholders of how the \n  Map of the PRD  existing system functions \nCharacterize linkages among  system for agriculture   \nstakeholders in terms of    Understanding of the gaps \ninformation  Analysis of strong and  in information flows, \nsharing, feedback, priority setting,  weak linkages among  coordination, and feedback \ndecision making, and resource  stakeholder groups  loops to planners and \nallocation    researchers \n \nAnalyze strong and weak \nlinkages, and discuss their \nsignificance for development \n \nAnalyze  Identify and analyze existing  Identification of current  Improved understanding \nInitiatives  projects  initiatives and their  of the contribution of \nand initiatives with effective  contribution to the PRD  current initiatives to \nlinkages  system  addressing gaps in the \nacross stakeholder groups    agricultural PRD system \n   \nPlan  Identify remaining gaps and  Feasible options for  Agreement on the need \nImprovements  opportunities  enhancing PRD system  for additional steps to \n      improve the PRD system, \nGenerate short-, medium-, and  and \nlong-term options for more  feasible options identified \neffective linkages  for action \n   \nAnalyze options using the PRD \nsystem map \n \nAgree on  Discuss follow-up actions   Action plan and  Effective leadership and \nActions    agreement  responsibility for follow-up \n  action \n \nPRD = planning, research, and development. \n \n \n11.   A wide range of stakeholder interests will be represented at the workshops, and in the \ndesign of possible follow-up activities. The workshops will require active inputs by participants in \nsmall groups and in plenary sessions. Each regional workshop will use the example of the \nnational sector planning, research, and development system of the host country as a starting \npoint for discussions. An important feature of the workshops will be case studies of projects, \nconsortia, regional forums, and knowledge systems that ADB and others have supported, and \nthat have already made significant contributions to the integration of national planning, research, \nand development. \n \n12.  The TA components will consist of (i) preparatory meetings for the agriculture and \nnatural resources research (ANRR) workshops, (ii) two regional workshops on coordinating \nagriculture research and development, and disseminating its results, in the Mekong and South \nEast Asia regions, and (iii) publication of workshop outcomes. \n ", "  Appendix 7  77 \n13.  Preparatory  Meetings  for  the  Agricultural  and  Natural  Resources  Research  \nSummits (Component 1). A meeting is envisaged of the Agriculture, Natural Resources, and \nRural Development (ANRRD) Committee and the working groups for this purpose. The working \ngroups will comprise staff from concerned departments and two international consultants who \nwill be hired to facilitate and implement the workshops. The meetings will be to discuss and \nfinalize (i) the program for the proposed forums, (ii) broad-based participation in the forums, (iii) \ntopics to be addressed, (iv) strategic program for disseminating RETA results, and (vi) logistical \narrangements for the ANRR workshops (protocol, travel, and related conference arrangements). \nThe TA will finance these preparatory activities and meet the full meeting costs, including any \ntravel costs of participants. \n \n14.  Coordination and Dissemination Workshops (Component 2). ADB proposes to take \nthe lead in establishing regional forums for sharing information and discussion among selected \nparticipants to promote mutual understanding, partnerships, and linkages for more effective \nplanning, research, and development in agriculture. The proposal is to initiate two forums in \n2005 for the Mekong Region and Southeast Asia, and to organize workshops at agreed-upon \nvenues in the two regions. The workshops are to start dialogue and coordination, and to \nfacilitate mutual understanding and collaboration, among the IARCs, NARSs, aid agencies, and \ncountry sector managers. The workshops will support learning and information flow among \ninternational  and  national  research  centers  to  permit  full  use  and  adoption  of  technology, \ncapacity  building,  and  inclusion  of  country  priorities in  the  agricultural  research  agenda  of \nIARCs. The regional forums will bring together research scientists and staff from the concerned \nregional departments, and promote information sharing on ongoing and future work. The forums \nare,  therefore,  expected  to  enhance  operational  links  and  synergies  among  national  and \ninternational research institutions and the aid community.   \n \n15.  Publication  and  Dissemination  of  Processes  and  Outcomes  (Component  3). \nOutputs  of the  two  ANRR  workshops  will be  published and  disseminated  to staff,  IARCs, \nconcerned  NARS,  government  officials  of  the  Central  and  South  Asia  regions,  and  other \nconcerned stakeholders. Lessons learned from this first initiative and the framework developed, \nif any, will also be put together to guide similar initiatives in other regions and countries. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $150,000, to be financed by ADB on a grant basis from \nADB's TA funding program.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will implement the three project \ncomponents. Within ADB, the Agriculture, Natural Resources and Social Sectors Division of the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department will ensure successful completion of the \nproposed project activities and will nominate a project officer for this responsibility. A working \ngroup will be formed to guide the planning and organization of the ANRR workshops. The \nworking  group  will  comprise  nominated  representatives  from  the  concerned  regional \ndepartments  and  thematic  sectors.  Two  co-hosts,  one  for  each  workshop  and  from  the \nrespective  region,  will  be  identified  to  help  implement  activities  concerning  the  planned \nworkshops. A letter of agreement, which will include procedures for disbursement of workshop \nexpenses  from  ADB  to  the  selected  co-hosts,  will  be  prepared  to  facilitate  payments  and \nliquidation  of  workshop  expenses.  The  co-hosts  will  be  requested  to  provide  in-kind \ncontributions of their staff, expertise, and office facilities necessary for the regional forums. A \nRETA secretariat will be established, led by the concerned project officer and supported by a \nfulltime  domestic  consultant  (technical  analyst).    Support  staff  of  the  Agriculture,  Natural \nResources and Social Sectors Divisions will participate in the RETA implementation when \nneeded. ", "  Appendix 7  79 \n5.
