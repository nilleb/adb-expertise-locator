Subregional economic cooperation schemes or growth areas have emerged as an \nincreasingly important strategy to accelerate economic growth and social development, by \nexploiting economic complementarities between participating regions. The 2003 Strategy for \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Development in the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-\nPhilippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) confirmed the role of a stronger private \nsector  to  promote  SME  development  with  the  objective  of  stimulating  long-term economic \ngrowth, creating jobs, and sustaining poverty reduction. All participating governments have \nadopted the strategy as their own, and asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help \noperationalize  it.  The  business  development  services  (BDSs)  is  a  key  component  in  this \nstrategy,  and  donors  such  as  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  have  followed \ninternational best practices in the provision of BDSs through its SME facilities, including its \ncurrent facility in Indonesia. The present technical assistance (TA), included in ADB\u2019s 2002 \nsubregional program for BIMP-EAGA, responds to the request of governments in the BIMP-\nEAGA to operationalize the BDS component of the strategy, by extending best practices in BDS \nprovision to parts of the BIMP-EAGA not served by IFC.1 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  BIMP-EAGA was formally launched in 1994 to develop the subregion by re-establishing \nand strengthening historical cultural and trade links between the member countries. BIMP-\nEAGA,  with  the  exception  of  Brunei,  share  common  characteristics  such  as  considerable \ndistance from their capitals, and resource-based regional economies that are less developed \nthan the capital regions. BIMP-EAGA was a key strategy of the four participating governments \nto correct regional economic imbalance by (i) facilitating freer movement of people, goods, and \nservices;  (ii) developing  vital  infrastructure;  and  (iii) coordinating  the  management  of \necosystems and common resources to ensure sustainable development.  \n \n3.  The strategic objective of BIMP-EAGA is to ensure that growth is driven by private sector \ninitiatives  built  on  economic  complementarities  and  the  use  of  shared  natural  resources, \ntechnology, and information. Empowering the private sector is thus essential to realize BIMP-\nEAGA\u2019s economic and social development goals. As early as 1996 an ADB-funded study2 \nidentified a wide  range of opportunities among member countries, and concluded that, with \nincreased regional economic cooperation, the subregion would become a major investment \ndestination in ASEAN for agro-industry, natural resource-based manufacturing, and tourism. \nThe study also recognized the role of SMEs in attaining social stability and balanced growth for \nBIMP-EAGA, and, hence, identified SME promotion as a crucial component of the strategy. \n \n4.  Since 1999, ADB has funded assessments of the SME environment within BIMP-EAGA \nthat produced a subregional strategy for SME development. The assessments were initially \nlimited  to  the  most  needy  subregions  of  Indonesia  (Kalimantan  and  Sulawesi)  and  the \nPhilippines (Mindanao and Palawan),3 and later expanded to include Brunei and the Malaysian \nstates of Sarawak and Sabah.4 Most of territories of eastern Indonesia and all those in southern \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in July 2001. \n2  ADB. 1995.  Technical Assistance for the  Study of the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East \nASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA). Manila (RETA No. 5625 for $1,800,000). \n3 ADB. 1999.  Technical Assistance for the Small and Medium Scale Enterprise in the EAGA Region. Manila \n(RETA 5880 for $300,000). \n4 ADB. 2001.  Technical Assistance for Expanding the Strategy for SME Development in the EAGA.  Manila \n(RETA 6018 for $240,000). \n ", "2  \n \nPhilippines lag behind the rest of the country in social and economic development. One of the \nmajor constraints faced by SMEs in these  territories includes the lack of an efficient and \nsustainable network of BDS providers to help SMEs meet challenges in generating viable trade \nand investment opportunities. \n \n5.  Effective networking with improved BDSs aims at removing SMEs\u2019 inherent constraint of \nsmall-scale production for better trade and investment opportunities. By definition, SMEs are \nconstrained by their small operations, which preclude individual enterprises from benefiting from \neconomies of scale, that is, from effectively establishing or expanding export linkages and tying \ninto the supply chains of large firms. SME development elsewhere shows that information \nsharing  is  more  effective  within  specific  industries  because  of  commonality  of  interests, \nconcerns, and capabilities.  Although chambers of commerce and other similar organizations \nprovide opportunities for networking, the multiplicity of interests slows down the process of \nputting cooperative activities in place. Few alliances exist among industry associations in the \nsubregions, resulting in the lack of opportunities for networking and defining requirements to \nvertically and horizontally integrate industries in-country and within BIMP-EAGA. In the absence \nof a focused group with common or related commercial interests, it is difficult to recognize and \ntake advantage of expanded trade and investment opportunities. \n \n6.  An initial mapping of existing SME-related BDSs in BIMP-EAGA prepared as part of the \nSME strategy shows that BDS initiatives are ongoing or planned in each area as provided by \ngovernment agencies, multilateral and bilateral funding agencies, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), and the private sector. The mapping exercise showed, however, that in-country BDSs \nare more inward than outward looking and primarily aimed at increasing local, rather than \nregional  or  international,  SME  competitiveness.  Considering  trade  and  investments  move \nbeyond national boundaries in BIMP-EAGA, new opportunities for BDS providers must be \nopened  to  test  the  efficacy  of  the  strategies  used  under  greatly  liberalized  and  highly \ncompetitive export market conditions. Worldwide, international agencies such as  IFC and its \npartners have demonstrated the demand and effectiveness of high-quality BDSs. Through a \nseries of specialized SME facilities, IFC, bilateral and multilateral donors provide local SMEs \nwith avenues to meet the existing demand for services needed to build commercially viable \nbusinesses, and take other broader initiatives to develop sustainable and dynamic SME sectors. \nThese facilities play a useful role, both in helping SMEs directly and in creating local capacity to \ngive them technical and financial support. They also help SMEs attract necessary financing for \ntheir ventures, prioritizing projects with potential to develop self-sustaining enterprises, generate \nemployment, increase skills, and stimulate export earnings. The staff and consultants in the \nproject development offices also provide other essential services such as training and research, \nand work with donors to frame and promote policy reforms aimed to improve the local business \nclimate.  In  Asia,  examples  of  these  IFC-managed  facilities  include  the  Mekong  Project \nDevelopment Facility, South Pacific Project Facility, and South Asia Development Facility, all \nfunded by ADB.  \n \n7.  BIMP-EAGA\u2019s common geography and waters (Celebes and Sulu seas) supply most of \nthe world\u2019s exports of coconut, seaweed and live fish, and, hence, offers a sizeable and \nscaleable demand for BDSs among subregional SMEs whose activities are based on these \nindigenous and abundant resources in the subregion. BIMP-EAGA, mainly Indonesia and the \nPhilippines, accounts for almost 80% of the world\u2019s coconut trade.5 Coconut is largely produced \nin small landholdings and is consumed fresh, with the remainder of the crop dried to copra, and \n                                                 \n5  The Philippines and Indonesia dominate coconut production. In 2002, according to the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization (FAO), both countries produced more than half of the world\u2019s production of coconut (49.6 million \nmetric tons).  \n ", "3 \npressed into coconut oil. The emergence of massive industrial production of palm oil has \ndiminished  the  traditional  importance  of  coconut  oil  for  cooking,  and,  hence,  rendered \nsmallholder  coconut  production  less  commercially  viable.6  New  product  development  for \ncoconut aims at improving commercial prospects of the crop. Technology for charcoal based on \ncoconut waste, oil for cosmetics, yogurt, and furniture are among some of the new commercial \nuses of coconut, for which research and development has already been undertaken, but not \nfully commercialized. Producers in BIMP-EAGA would benefit from BDSs to develop new trade \nand investment opportunities for the crop.  \n \n8.  Seaweed is also a main BIMP-EAGA resource that is available to island communities \nand would potentially benefit from BDSs to improve commercial product development, protect \nthe environment, and support sustainable income generation in small island communities. The \nPhilippines  is  the  largest  world\u2019s  supplier  of  seaweed,  which  has  multiple  uses  such  as \nstabilizers  in  food,  cosmetics,  and  pharmaceuticals.  In  Indonesia,  much  of  the  seaweed \nproduced is exported raw for further processing overseas, in some cases to the Philippines. \nHence, there is potential for a cross-country exchange of technology, trade and investment \nopportunities between SMEs in southern Philippines and northern Sulawesi.  \n \n9.  BIMP-EAGA countries, mainly Indonesia and the Philippines, also account for 85% of \nthe world\u2019s aquarium fish supply(cid:190) a growing but very specialized market(cid:190) and thus intervention \nin these countries has an immediate global effect. The trade provides sustainable job creation \nfor rural fishing communities, with increased retention of income at the community level and \nmarket-induced conservation of coral reefs.7 To develop this niche trade, BDSs will be useful for \nSMEs to make live-fish trade sustainable through improved certification, potential financing, and \nreef conservation. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TA aims at promoting business networking among SMEs in the least developed \nareas of BIMP-EAGA where cooperation, especially between Indonesia and Philippines, will \nfacilitate knowledge transfer or where trade and investment opportunities exist to establish \ndirect trading relations while keeping in mind the economic, social, and environmental impact on \nBIMP-EAGA communities. The subregional approach of the TA with emphasis on private sector \ncomplements ADB assistance being prepared and considered under the Indonesia and the \nPhilippines country programs.8 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB supports the Government of Indonesia to improve productivity of coconut smallholders in Indonesia. See \nADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Productivity Enhancement for Tree Crops. Manila (TA 4224 for $1.4 million).  \n7  In Indonesia and the Philippines, cyanide and dynamite fishing is rapidly destroying coral reefs. Of all 556 locations \nwith coral in Indonesia, only one third is covered mostly with living coral. See ADB. 2003. Country Environmental \nAnalysis Report, Table 2.4. Manila. Also, ADB has supported the Government\u2019s coral reef conservation in \nIndonesia, including a new participatory process under its latest loan. See ADB. 2002. Coral Reef Rehabilitation \nand Management Project Phase II. Manila. (Loan 1962 for $41 million).  \n8  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the SME Export Development Project. Manila (Loan 1978 for $85 million), and ADB. \n2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for SME Export Development Project. Manila (TA 4041 for \n$0.5 million). ADB will sign a memorandum of understanding with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to \nsupport small exporters, including those in eastern Indonesia, with combined BDS and investment credit. Also, \nfuture ADB lending and nonlending operations for SMEs are envisaged to benefit SMEs in southern Philippines.  \n ", "4  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The aim of the TA is to promote BDSs through networking within BIMP-EAGA, drawing \nfrom  the  vast  experience  of  IFC  in  Asia,9  to  (i) facilitate  knowledge  transfer  on  product \ndevelopment among SMEs (through product and market studies, individual and group SME \nbusiness plans, business strategy workshops); and (ii) identify common industry constraints in \nthe subregion (through dissemination workshops and policy advocacy). TA activities will be \ndesigned to have economic, social, and environmental impact on coastal communities. The TA \nwill target industries where new environmentally sustainable technologies and value-added \nprocesses can be developed to (i) increase the economic participation of SMEs through margin \nexpansion and sales growth, (ii) underpin social development and poverty reduction through \nsustainable job creation, and (iii) develop financial incentives for environmental sustainability.  \n \n12.  The TA represents ADB\u2019s efforts to adopt international best practices in BDSs for SMEs \nin BIMP-EAGA  through  one  of  the  newest  IFC  facilities  in  Asia\u2014the  Indonesia  Enterprise \nDevelopment Facility, renamed Program for Eastern Indonesia SME Assistance or PENSA. \nUnder the facility,  there are four program areas with proven potential to create a significant \nnumber of jobs and spur local economic growth, and will be supported by a business-enabling \nenvironment program based in Jakarta. Development of agribusiness in south Sulawesi is one \nof such programs. For a full description of the PENSA\u2019s setup, program and budget for 2003-\n2008, see Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  Under  the  TA,  the  agribusiness  program  will  be  expanded  to  include  BIMP-EAGA \ncenters such as Manado (north Sulawesi), and Davao (southern Philippines) and BIMP-EAGA \nspecific agro-industries (coconut and marine products). The expanded program represents part \nof a logical building block in subregional SME development, and builds on the existing TA \nexperience  of  ADB,10  Swisscontact  and  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency \n(CIDA),11 in both Indonesia and the Philippines, two of the member countries in BIMP-EAGA. \nThe TA will help establish a regional network for SMEs to develop indigenous natural resources \nsuch as coconut and marine products. These agribusinesses have been chosen because they \nare based on similar geography and topography and have scaleable opportunities for trade and \ninvestment in new technologies. The TA activities will focus on promoting these indigenous \nagribusinesses  to  stimulate  exports  under  a  dual  approach.  One  will  focus  on  SMEs \nthemselves, and support BDS provision to promote product development and marketing to \ncommercialize existing or new technologies. The other will focus on local governments and \nsupport fast-track plans to promote product delivery, investment, and environmental protection. \nUnder the expanded program,  PENSA will provide short-term BDS assignments, including \nadvice on the enabling environment. For a full description of the program and terms of reference \nfor consultants, see Appendix 3. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n14.  The total estimated cost of the TA is $700,000, to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund (JSF), funded by the Government of Japan, for a total of 60 person-months \n                                                 \n9  BDSs are the focus of these facilities. The IFC SME Department recently established a knowledge management \nteam working specifically on BDSs. A recent survey by this team identified that the facilities have over 100 different \nBDS-related activities under implementation around the world. \n10 ADB works with local governments in Pare-Pare and Bulukumba in southern Sulawesi to improve BDS and \nregulations affecting small businesses. See ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Strengthening BDS for SMEs. \nManila (TA 3829 for $1.5 million).  \n11 CIDA works in southern and northern Sulawesi through the Private Enterprise Project (PEP), and several initiatives \nin Mindanao, southern Philippines.  \n ", "5 \nof international (20 person-months) and domestic (40 person-months) full-time and part-time \nconsultancies. Cost estimates are in Appendix 4. IFC\u2019s parallel cofinancing of the entire facility \namounts to $5 million for 2003- 2008 while other multilateral and bilateral funding agencies\u201912 \nparallel cofinancing amounts to the balance ($17 million). To ensure sustainability of the project, \nthe TA will institute cost recovery measures for the BDS component.13 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s Southeast Asian Department, in coordination with the Private Sector Department, \nwill be the Executing Agency for the TA. The consultants will be IFC, through PENSA, hired as a \ndirect  award.  The  operating  procedures  for  the  direct  award  under  the  TA  are  also  in \nAppendix 4. The current arrangement is based on previous cooperation between ADB and IFC \nwith RETAs to finance other similar SME facilities in the South Pacific, Mekong, and, more \nrecently, South Asia.14  \n \n16.  The  program  will  mainly  focus  on  developing  linkages  between  Indonesian  and \nPhilippine  SMEs  in  BIMP-EAGA,  which  includes  north  and  south  Sulawesi  in  Indonesia, \nMindanao and Palawan in southern Philippines, and Sabah and Sarawak in east Malaysia. \nInitially, the program will be developed, managed, and supported by PENSA offices in the \nDenpasar headquarters and Makassar office (south Sulawesi). Two Manado and Davao office \nrepresentatives will be selected and they will draw on the work of PENSA, particularly in \nmarketing, access to capital, and business association development. The program will establish \nlinks between Indonesia and the Philippines, whether through direct trade or through knowledge \nand skills sharing. Initially, the program will be structured as a series of pilot programs, mainly in \nnorth Sulawesi (Indonesia) and Mindanao (Philippines). During the pilot phase, these projects \nwill be overseen from the Makassar office in south Sulawesi. Based on the initial results, the \nprojects might be scaled up.  \n \n17.  In close coordination with ADB, IFC will manage the program and coordinate the TA \nactivities  for  up  to  36  months,  through  international  and  domestic  consultants,  starting  in \nFebruary 2004. The individual experts financed by the TA will support implementation by \nproviding individual SMEs and local associations of SMEs with specific advice and skills in such \ntechnical fields as the trade in seaweed, live fish, and coconut.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening  Regional  Networking  for  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  in  Brunei-\nIndonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n                                                 \n12 Australia, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

PENSA will initially work in four program areas: (i) trade and export promotion, (ii) SME \nfinancing, (iii) extractive industry linkages to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and \n(iv) agribusiness linkages to SMEs. The latter is the focus of this technical assistance (TA), and \nits geographical coverage will be extended to include activities in northern Sulawesi, southern \nPhilippines, and, if possible, eastern Malaysia. PENSA has selected these four program areas \nfor their potential to create a significant number of jobs and spur local economic growth, and will \nbe supported by a business-enabling environment program based in Jakarta. \n \n \nFigure A2.1: PENSA\u2019s Overall Program Structure \n \n \nPENSA (Denpasar) \n \nBusiness Enabling \n  Environment (Jakarta) \n \nTrade & Export  SME    SME Extractive \n  Promotion  Financing  Industry \n  (Denpasar)   (Surabaya)  Linkages \n  (Balikpapan) \n \n   \nSME = small and medium-sized enterprise; PENSA = Program for Eastern Indonesia SME Assistance. \n \nA.  Trade and Export Promotion (Denpasar) \n \n2.  PENSA\u2019s Trade and Export Program (TEP) will be based in Denpasar and initially work \nwith furniture and handicraft producers. The furniture and handicraft sector was selected as \nskilled local craftsmanship and local designers can contribute significant local value added. \nProduction in this sector is also centered around local villages, so the benefits of identifying new \nsustainable export market opportunities will flow almost directly to large numbers of local \nvillagers, improving the prospects of many local communities. \n \n3.  The initiative will first develop and deliver a program of training to local wood and \nfurniture producers in Bali and east Java. A major production problem in this region is that wood \nis frequently not properly treated or dried, causing it to crack once it leaves the humidity of \nIndonesia, which discourages repeat export orders. \n \n4.  The training program will set in place sustainable structures and systems of training \ndelivery covering quality improvement, as well as basic business skills in marketing, design, and \nbasic finance. The training will be developed by PENSA staff, and delivered by local providers \nsuch as local tertiary institutions or local business service providers on a cost-recovery basis.  \n \n5.  The training program will also include an international marketing component. Market \nbuilding is important as numbers of international buyers coming to Indonesia have dropped \ndramatically  following  the  Bali  bombing  and,  more  recently,  the  severe  acute  respiratory \n ", "Appendix 2  9\nsyndrome (SARS) epidemic. Local producers stand to benefit greatly from being able to market \ntheir products overseas without waiting for the buyers to come to them. TEP\u2019s marketing \ncomponent  will  commission  trade  data  research  to  identify  which  international  markets \npotentially offer the best price point or the greatest demand for selected products. This initial \nanalysis will then be followed up with a more detailed market survey of those higher-priced or \ngreater-demand markets to see what sort of products are most likely to be successful. The \nsurvey results will be made available on a fee-for-service basis to Indonesian producers and \nexporters. The program will look to hand over the market research processes it develops to \nlocal partners for ongoing delivery. \n \n6.  In cooperation with the Kearny Alliance Foundation, TEP will provide practical hands-on \nassistance to selected local producers who apply what they have learned from the program\u2019s \ntraining and marketing components to day-to-day attempts to meet export orders. For a fee, a \nstand-alone center will provide this deal-facilitation service. One such center will be established \nas a pilot. The Kearny Alliance Foundation has a long history of working with SMEs in Indonesia \nand can provide TEP with valuable insight into the practical problems that befall SMEs securing \nexport orders. \n \nB.  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance (Surabaya) \n \n7.  The PENSA SME financing program will be based in Surabaya and focus on helping \nlocal SMEs gain access to new and more suitable sources of financing.1 This work will involve \ndelivering training and seminars to build understanding between banks and SMEs. For local \nbanks this training will cover how to better design and market their products and services to \nmeet the needs of SMEs, as well as education in the practical constraints that face small \nbusiness. For SMEs this training will cover the financing process and its obligations. \n \n8.  Another major problem that many SMEs cite is the banks\u2019 requirement that loans be \nsecured by collateral worth 100\u2013150% of the value of the debt, with most of this collateral in real \nestate. Historically, banks had sound reasons to limit their lending focus. Nonetheless, local \nbanks could safely expand their criteria, supporting the growth of SMEs while maintaining strong \ncredit quality and risk-management procedures. However, several changes may be needed: \n(i) banks need to understand the potential applicability of other financing products, (ii) customers \nneed  to  provide  banks  with  more  uniform  and  higher-quality  financial  statements,  and \n(iii) bankers must become more sale and solution oriented. \n \n9.  As a result PENSA will implement the following initiatives: (i) create a targeted sales and \nmarketing training program for banks; (ii) develop a training program for  banks to help them \nestablish  SME  industry  analysis;  (iii) prepare and sponsor an SME banking best-practices \nforum; (iv) support the creation of industry standards for financial information provided by SMEs; \n(v) build a turnkey financial product with select bank partners; and (vi) directly train SMEs to \nbetter prepare them to access sources of finance. Indonesian banks have already established a \nfoundation to serve the SME market. Even so, PENSA has significant scope to work with local \nbanks and broaden their SME-financing activities without eroding the bank portfolios\u2019 credit \nquality. \n \n                                                 \n1  Under ADB. 2002.

Extractive Industry Linkages (Balikpapan) \n \n10.  The extractive industry sector in eastern Indonesia generates hundreds of millions of \ndollars of revenue, of which only a small share is captured by local communities and SMEs. \nBalikpapan is a center for many of the oil, gas, and mining companies operating in east \nKalimantan. This part of the program will help local SMEs and communities capture a greater \nshare of the economic benefits generated by large-scale extractive industries based in eastern \nIndonesia. PENSA will establish an extractive industry linkage program based in Balikpapan. \n \n11.  Crucial to the success of the program is determining where opportunities lie for SMEs in \neast Kalimantan. A study will determine the nature of the market\u2019s demands, in particular the \nsourcing requirements of multinational corporations and their relationship with their incumbent \nsuppliers. On the supply side, the study will determine the capabilities of local SMEs and their \npotential to meet the demands of multinational corporations. \n \n12.  The results of the diagnostic study will be used to establish a number of pilot programs \nworking with selected producers and their key customers. The linkage work will operate on two \nlevels: first, as a continuation of the current oil, gas, and mining community development work; \nand second, by supporting the development of local SMEs to meet the demand for locally \nsourced higher value-added products. As this linkage work can be replicated in other industry \nsectors, the program will ultimately develop a model for supply chain linkage and community \ndevelopment, drawing on the experiences of the Balikpapan pilot projects. \n \nD.  Agribusiness Linkages (Makassar) \n \n13.  The Makassar program will focus on developing the infrastructure and opportunity for \nSMEs within the agribusiness sector in south Sulawesi. Agribusiness is the single largest \nemployer,  particularly  at  the  lower  income  level.  PENSA  will  undertake  a  demand-driven \nanalysis of the potential opportunities present in south Sulawesi for local growers and suppliers \nof agricultural produce.  \n \n14.  The program will develop the business environment by strengthening the market for \nbusiness development services, improving access to capital and forging relationships with \nuniversities to improve the technical capacity of local SMEs. The program will also seek to \nimprove transportation and logistics to enhance delivery between south Sulawesi and the end \nexport markets. \n \n15.  PENSA will build a linkage to a large local or international processor that will purchase, \nprocess, and then market this produce. The program will seek to promote fair trade where \nlabeling can open new markets, and business opportunity will be a powerful incentive to the \nprogram\u2019s implementation. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  11\nFigure A2.2: PENSA\u2019s Program on Agribusiness \n \n \n \nAgribusiness Linkages \n \n(Makassar) \n \n \n \n \n \nDiag nostic Component  Supply Side Assistance  Demand Driven \n      Development \n\u2022 Ide ntify commodity  \u2022 Producer/ Grower support   \ngro up where market  \u2022 Product development  \u2022 Working to establish value \nopportunity exists  through technical  added processing \n \n\u2022 Ide ntify potential  improvements  capacity \npa rtners  \u2022 Transport and logistics  \u2022 Potential cooperation with \ncapacity building   IFC investment team  \n \n \nIFC = International Finance Corporation. \n \n \nTable A2.1.

Below are the \nestimated work plan for 2004 and sample terms of reference for consulting services to be \nrequired under the plan.  \n \nI.   Work Plan for 2004 \n \n4.   The program will focus on three sectors and will run a number of pilot programs in each \nsector during the year. The objective will be to determine which projects have the potential for \nreplication and for upsizing in BIMP-EAGA. Pilot projects will be initially carried out in both the \nPhilippines and Indonesia. These will be stand alone projects, however efforts will be made to \nensure that the lessons learned on one project be applied to another. In particular, cross-BIMP-\nEAGA knowledge transfer will be actively stimulated. The initial projects are detailed below and \nwhile this list is neither exhaustive nor exclusive.  \n \nA.   Seaweed Program \n \n5.  The program will build on PENSA\u2019s existing work and would increase its regional impact \nby raising the level of market information, allowing better risk adjusted investment decisions to \nbe made.
