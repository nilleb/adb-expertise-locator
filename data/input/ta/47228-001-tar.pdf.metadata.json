Strengthening disaster resilience at the community level is recognized as a priority in the \nnational disaster risk management (DRM) policy framework of Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in Southeast Asia. The Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  Agreement  on  Disaster  Management  and  Emergency  Response  also \nprioritizes implementation of community-based DRM.1  The Yogyakarta Declaration on Disaster \nRisk Reduction, adopted at the 5th Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in \nOctober  2012,2 calls  on  DRM  stakeholders  to  build  community  resilience  by  scaling  up \nsuccessful  community-based  DRM  initiatives,  developing  resilient  community  targets  and \nindicators, and strengthening the capacity of communities and local institutions to respond to \nemerging and future risks. Accordingly, the Integrated Disaster Risk Management (IDRM) Fund \ngives priority to supporting innovative solutions for community-based, gender-focused DRM that \nis participatory, has a high demonstration value and the potential to be replicated and increased \nin scale, and engages strongly with civil society organizations (CSOs).3 \n2.  Through  this  technical  assistance  (TA)  project,  ADB  will  support  community-based, \ngender-focused  DRM  interventions  in  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic,  Myanmar,  the  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.4 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Natural hazards continue to cause significant loss of life and property in Asia and the \nPacific. Recent analysis from an ADB study  indicates that the direct physical  losses from \ndisasters are rising more rapidly than the gross domestic product of Asia and the Pacific.5 The \nintensity and, in some areas, the frequency of extreme climatic events is expected to increase \nwith global warming, potentially exacerbating this trend. The ADB analysis also shows that, \namong DMCs, those in Southeast Asia fared the worst on average in terms of loss of life and \ndamage from disasters during 1970\u20132010, both when measured per capita and relative to land \nmass. The situation is even bleaker when taking into account impacts on local communities and \nbusinesses  from  localized,  recurrent  disaster  events  that  are  largely  unrecorded,  and  not \ntypically captured in official disaster statistics. Cumulatively, these \u201ceveryday disasters\u201d trap \nlarge numbers of people, and especially vulnerable populations (e.g., women and children), into \na cycle of poverty and disaster through repeated livelihood setbacks.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response is the legally binding regional policy \nframework for all ASEAN member states and serves as a common platform in responding to disasters in ASEAN. \nIn 2010, the work program for the framework for 2010\u20132015 was approved that prioritizes regional initiatives.  \n2  The Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction is a biennial mechanism that brings together the \nministers in charge of disaster risk management from Asia and the Pacific to discuss policy issues. \n3  The IDRM Fund was approved by the Board on 25 February 2013, and serves as a resource for development of \ninnovative regional solutions for IDRM in Southeast Asian DMCs. As used here, CSOs are non-profit, non-state \nactors that do not seek governing power. CSOs unite people to advance shared goals and interests, and include \nnongovernment  organizations,  professional  associations,  foundations,  independent  research  institutes, \ncommunity-based  organizations,  faith-based  organizations,  people\u2019s  organizations,  youth  groups,  social \nmovements, and labor unions.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 12 September 2013.  \n5  ADB. 2013. Investing in Resilience: Ensuring a Disaster-Resistant Future. Manila. \n6  Global Network for Civil Society Organisations for Disaster Reduction. 2011. If We Do Not Join Hands: Views from \nthe Frontline Local Reports of Progress on Implementing the Hyogo Framework for Action, with  Strategic \nRecommendations for More Effective Implementation. London. \n ", "2   \n4.  The Hyogo Framework for Action, 2005\u20132015 was adopted in 2005, and significant \nprogress has been made since then to reduce disaster risk in Asia and the Pacific. However, the \nmidterm review of the Hyogo Framework for Action demonstrates progress has been insufficient \nat the local level, has not targeted vulnerable populations, and has not adequately tapped local \nknowledge and solutions to inform policy and decision making.7 Local people and grassroots \norganizations\u2014such as women\u2019s groups\u2014are essential for strengthening disaster resilience. \nManaging  disaster  risk  at  the  local  level  requires  community  participation  in  planning, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  of  interventions.  It  also  requires  an  enabling  environment \nthrough policy and legislative frameworks, incentives, information management systems, and \ncapacity strengthening of both communities and local technical line agencies.  \n \n5.  Community-based  DRM  has  been  used  previously  in  Southeast  Asia.  However,  in \npractice, it has often been limited to stand-alone pilot projects focused on improving community \npreparedness and response capacities, and has not necessarily sought to incorporate disaster \nresilience within broader community-based development. It has often failed to recognize (i) the \ncapacity of organized youth and women\u2019s groups to take the lead in strengthening disaster \nresilience, and (ii) that solutions they provide can benefit entire communities. It is essential to \nengage risk-prone communities in a dialogue with government and CSOs engaged in local \ndevelopment, and to jointly identify root causes of disaster risk, prioritize actions, mobilize \nresources, undertake implementation, and monitor progress. Such participatory processes can \nhelp identify innovative solutions to complex issues such as disasters, the impacts of which \noften  cross  administrative  boundaries  and  sectors.  These  processes  can  also  establish \npartnerships  to  scale  up  implementation,  empower  vulnerable  populations,  and  improve \naccountability.  \n \n6.  Much  experience  and  expertise  on  DRM  is  already  available  at  the  local  level\u2014\nespecially  in  local  governments  and  grassroots  organizations,  and  particularly  women\u2019s \ngroups\u2014which have a good understanding of local hazards and vulnerabilities within the overall \ncontext of development that they have gained from working with vulnerable groups.  Local \ngovernments and CSOs can thus play a vital role in mobilizing and facilitating community \nengagement in DRM. Regional CSOs can likewise foster peer-to-peer learning among their \nlocal counterparts. However, these organizations need support to enable them to scale up \nsuccessful interventions and facilitate peer-to-peer learning. There is an equal need to create \nincentives for local authorities and CSOs to strengthen disaster resilience partnerships, support \ninvestments in community-based DRM, and share knowledge on innovative practices.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  increased  demand  for  investments  on  strengthening \ndisaster  resilience  at  the  community  level  in  specific  Southeast  Asian  DMCs\u2014Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet \nNam. Such investments will focus at the local level, target the most vulnerable populations, \nmake use of local knowledge and solutions to inform policy and decision making, facilitate \nsharing of knowledge, and be considered as investments for sustainable development. The \noutcome of the TA will be access to and use of community-based and gender-focused DRM \nknowledge by local governments and CSOs in selected Southeast Asian DMCs. \n                                                \n7  United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. 2011.

Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support local governments and CSOs in selected Southeast Asian DMCs to \nwork  closely  in  implementing  community-based  DRM-related  interventions  and  facilitating \nregional peer-to-peer learning. The TA will have the following outputs. \n \n9.  Output 1: Community-based disaster risk management interventions in selected \nSoutheast Asian developing member countries. This output will provide grants to support a \nmaximum  of  four  pilot  subprojects  on  community-based  DRM.  The  subprojects  may  be \nproposed by local governments, a CSO, or group of CSOs working on DRM-related issues in \nSoutheast Asia, in response to a call for proposals issued by ADB, and using the application \nform  described  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  Subproject  selection  will  use  the  process \ndeveloped for projects under the IDRM Fund.8 Subprojects should:   \n \n(i)  involve local governments, civil society (including target communities, youth groups, and \ngrassroots  women\u2019s  organizations),  and  relevant  national  government  agencies  in \ndesign, implementation, and monitoring;9 \n(ii)  address the needs of the target community, and recognize women as agents of change \nfor strengthening disaster resilience;  \n(iii)  focusing on innovative disaster risk reduction measures to strengthen resilience at the  \ncommunity level,10 especially of women, and/or focus on elements to strengthen the \nenabling environment for scaling up of community-based DRM interventions through the \nregular development process; \n(iv)  benefit ongoing or planned projects undertaken by the government and/or ADB that \nfocus on DRM or wider community-driven development;  \n(v)  focus  on  community-level  DRM  issues  common  to  DMCs  in  Southeast  Asia,  with \nlessons that can be shared regionally, with solutions replicated in other DMCs; \n(vi)  partner with regional DRM centers of excellence to allow lessons from other countries to \nbe incorporated in subproject design, with sharing of results within the region; and \n(vii)  be small-scale (not to exceed $100,000), focus on the disaster risk reduction measures \ndescribed above, and have an implementation period of 12\u201324 months. \n \n                                                \n8  Local governments and CSOs will be encouraged to submit subproject applications.  Applications will be reviewed \nin two batches. Due dates for applications will be 31 January 2014 and 31 March 2014. The IDRM fund manager \nwill review the applications within 10 days of each application deadline, and ensure applications comply with the \nrelevant eligibility criteria. If the application does not meet the criteria, the fund manager will discuss the issues \nwith the applicant for revision or withdrawal. For each subproject, the fund manager will make recommendation to \nthe IDRM working group comprising of representatives from Poverty Reduction, Gender, and Social Development \nDivision (RSGS); Environment and Safeguard Division (RSES); Sustainable Infrastructure Division (RSID); Public \nManagement, Governance, and Participation Division (RSGP) of RSDD, and representatives from Southeast Asia \nDepartment (SERD) and Pacific Department (PARD).The working group will have 7 working days to review, \ncomment, and endorse the subproject applications. Applicants will then have 5 working days to take the \ncomments into consideration and revise the application if needed. Once completed, the fund manager will forward \nthe applications endorsed by the IDRM working group to the IDRM steering committee to approve the allocation of \nresources from this TA under the IDRM Fund. The IDRM steering committee comprises of Directors General \nRSDD, SERD, and PARD. \n9  Subprojects  will  follow  the  core  principles  of  participation  in  ADB.  2012.  Strengthening  Participation  for \nDevelopment Results: An Asian Development Bank Guide to Participation. Manila. \n10  Measures would include assessing disaster risk; participatory disaster risk reduction planning to identify priority \nnon-structural and structural interventions to reduce risk; implementation of non-structural interventions, such as \nskill development for livelihood diversification, natural resources management, disaster resilient construction, \nmaintenance  of  community  infrastructure,  and  dissemination  of  early  warning  signals;  and  advocating  for \nimplementation of structural interventions through local investment projects.  \n ", "4   \n10.  Implementation of the subprojects will enable ADB and other development partners to \naccess and use knowledge relating to (i) innovative solutions to strengthen disaster community \nresilience; (ii) approaches for strengthening participation by local stakeholders in the design, \nimplementation, and monitoring of community-based DRM interventions; and (iii) approaches for \nscaling up community-based DRM interventions.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Knowledge sharing regarding innovative community-based disaster risk \nmanagement  solutions.  Based  on  the  submissions  received  from  CSOs,  United  Nations \nagencies or regional organizations in response to a call for proposals by ADB, and following the \nselection criteria described below, this output will provide a grant to implement a knowledge \nsharing subproject on regional peer-to-peer learning among local governments, civil society, \nand  grassroots  organizations,  including  women  and  youth  groups  active  in  DRM  in  six \nSoutheast Asian DMCs. The selection criteria will include (i) the approach and method proposed \nto facilitate peer-to-peer learning and the outreach to grassroots organizations, (ii) links to \nexisting  knowledge-sharing  mechanisms  in  the  country,  and  (iii)  cost  effectiveness  and \nsustainability. The peer-to-peer learning will focus on: \n \n(i)  the use of tools to facilitate participation by local stakeholders in community-based DRM; \n(ii)  participation by women in strengthening community disaster resilience; \n(iii)  innovative approaches for strengthening community disaster resilience through local \ndevelopment and investments; and  \n(iv)  approaches to scaling up community-based DRM through partnerships between local \ngovernments and CSOs.  \n \n12.  Implementation of the subproject on peer-to-peer learning will result in benchmarking of \ngood practices on community-based DRM; increased regional dialogue regarding challenges \nand solutions in strengthening community disaster resilience; and exchange of innovative ideas \nand  experiences,  including  experiences  gained  from  the  subprojects  under  output  1.  The \nsubproject will strengthen partnership with the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, which is a \nregional center of excellence and has been implementing programs related to community-based \ndisaster risk management. This will help improve the design and implementation of community \ndisaster resilience projects being implemented in the participating countries. \n \n13.  Assumptions, risks, and criteria. The TA assumes that successful community-based \nDRM interventions that can be applied in Southeast Asia are available, and that participating \nlocal governments and CSOs are committed to implementing the project. The key risks will be \nthat the local governments and CSOs (i) are unaware of the opportunity to apply for grants to \nimplement the subprojects, and (ii) lack the capacity to develop subproject proposals and/or to \nimplement community-based DRM projects and partner with ADB. To mitigate the risks, the call \nfor  proposals  for  subprojects  will  be  disseminated  through  ADB\u2019s  website  and  through  its \nnetwork of civil society partners in Southeast Asia. Stakeholders expressing interest will be \nsupported by the TA project team in partnership with nongovernment organization and civil \nsociety focal point in ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department (SERD) in developing proposals for \nsubproject. Criteria for selecting the implementing agencies for different subprojects will include \ntheir experience in (i) implementing community-based DRM interventions in Southeast Asia, (ii) \nworking  with  local  stakeholders,  and  (iii)  facilitating  regional  peer-to-peer  learning  among \ngrassroots organizations through a network or consortium of CSOs. Past experience working \nwith  ADB  or  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  development  partners  will  be  considered \nadvantageous. \n \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, and will be financed on a grant basis by the \nIntegrated Disaster Risk Management Fund,11 and administered by ADB. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The proposed TA will be implemented over 26 months, from January 2014 to February \n2016. ADB will be the executing agency through the Public Management, Governance and \nParticipation Division (RSGP) in the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, which \nwill be responsible for managing TA activities in collaboration with SERD. Once subprojects \nunder outputs 1 and 2 are selected, letters of no objection will be secured from the relevant \ngovernment prior to subproject implementation. ADB will engage the proponents of the selected \nsubprojects through a letter of agreement. \n \n16.  For  output  1,  using  a  letter  of  agreement,  ADB  will  finance  subprojects  that  will \nimplement community-based DRM. Because of the small-scale and grassroots nature of the \nsubprojects, proponents will need to have a history of DRM-related work with communities, \nCSOs, and the local government of the target area. RSGP will work closely with SERD in \nselecting the subprojects. \n \n17.  For output 2, using a letter of agreement, ADB will engage a CSO with a network of \ngrassroots  organizations  working  on  DRM  in  the  participating  DMCs,  or  a  United  Nations \nagency  or  regional  organization  with  expertise  in  working  with  communities  and  women\u2019s \ngroups.  \n \n18.  In order to facilitate knowledge sharing among the subprojects, the TA will utilize 28 \nperson-months of consultancy inputs to be provided by one international consultant (4 person-\nmonths) and one national consultant (24 person-months). All consultants will be engaged by \nADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time). The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. All disbursements \nunder the TA will be  made in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.
