INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will contribute to a long-\nterm and sustained effort to scale up the protection and sustainable management of a network of \nwetland sites in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF), identified for their globally important \nbiodiversity  values  and  the  provision  of  critical  ecosystem  services.  The  TA  will  address \ninstitutional capacity and regional cooperation, generate consensus on priority sites, propose a \npipeline of investments to maintain these sites, and develop a financing mechanism to support \nthe flyway in the long term. The investments made at the priority sites will protect internationally \nthreatened waterbird species and wetland biodiversity while maximizing co-benefits for people. \n \n2.  The TA seeks to support and build on the objectives of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway \nPartnership  (EAAFP)  Strategic  Plan  2019\u20132028,  to  develop  a  comprehensive  network  of \ninternationally important wetland sites.1 This will be done by identifying the sites of highest priority \nwithin the network and engaging Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries \n(DMCs) to strengthen their protection and sustainable use of these sites. The TA is included in \nthe 2021 Management-approved results-based workplan of the Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department (SDCC). The TA is aligned with ADB's Strategy 2030 and its \noperational priorities of accelerating progress in gender equality; tackling climate change, building \nclimate  and  disaster  resilience and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  promoting  rural \ndevelopment and food security; and fostering regional cooperation and integration, especially by \nincreasing and diversifying regional public goods. It contributes to DMCs\u2019 national biodiversity \nrequirements  under  international  treaties  and  conventions, 2  and  to  several  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (e.g., 12, 13, and 15).3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The EAAF is the most vulnerable of the world\u2019s eight major migratory flyways. It covers \nEast and Southeast Asia as well as Australasia, extending across 22 countries from the Arctic \nCircle in the north to New Zealand in the south.4 Thousands of wetlands are present in the EAAF, \nwhich supports more than 50 million migratory waterbirds of more than 210 species, of which 20% \nare globally threatened. The wetlands that make up the EAAF provide essential ecosystem \nservices such as food, medicine, fuel, income, and other benefits for nearly 200 million people in \nthe Asia-Pacific region while also regulating flood waters and sequestering carbon. Despite this, \nextensive loss or degradation of coastal and inland wetlands continues,5 largely because of land \nconversion, drainage for agriculture and as a result of climate change.6 Hunting of waterbirds and \nother wetland fauna also remains a major threat at many sites.7 While the EAAFP and other \ndevelopment partners have made successful efforts to protect migratory waterbirds and wetlands \n \n1  The Strategic Plan is endorsed by 14 regional member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), of which 10 \nare developing member countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Australia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and \nNew Zealand are regional members of ADB. \n2  A partial list includes the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, the Convention on Biological \nDiversity, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Convention on Migratory Species. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 May 2021. \n4  EAAFP.

Nature 565, 222\u2013225. \n ", "2 \nin the EAAF,8 these endeavors must be expanded from site-focused projects to a network-wide \nprogram across multiple countries.9 The TA will support the development of a new ADB Regional \nFlyway Initiative (RFI), scaling up the earlier interventions and providing an opportunity for nature-\npositive investments at a regional scale. The constraints on the efforts so far can be grouped into \nthree key areas.  \n \n4.  Limited institutional capacity and lack of data for proper valuation of wetland \necosystem services. Data inadequacies hinder the biological, economic, and social justification \nfor protecting and sustainably managing EAAF wetlands. Consequently, key ecosystem services \nare undervalued and not maximized for local, national, and regional benefit. A poor understanding \nof the regional nature of threats and need for collective action has led to disjointed, nationally \nfocused conservation efforts, often incompatible with the needs of species that move through the \nnetwork, crossing national borders in response to food availability and climatic conditions.  \n \n5.  Inadequate  support  for  sustainable  wetland  management.  Wetland  protection \nreceives limited financing in most DMCs. Funds are lacking for direct site interventions (protection, \nrestoration,  and  sustainable  management)  and  for  longer-term  site  management,  regional \ncoordination,  and  network  management  through  the  EAAFP.  Insufficient  technical  skills, \ninstitutional capacity, and human resources compound the problem, while weak legislation, \nabsence of zoning, and protection of priority sites hinder effective management.10 \n \n6.  Lack  of  sustainable  livelihood  options  and  financing.  Few  viable  livelihood \nalternatives are open to local people who are currently engaged in activities that degrade or \ndestroy wetlands and the species that use them. The resources to support a transition to more \nsustainable practices, such as ecotourism or sustainable aquaculture, are rarely available. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: effective protection and sustainable use of a \nnetwork of wetland sites in the EAAF bolstered, benefiting wetland biodiversity and people.11 The \nTA will have the following outcome: wetland management in the EAAF improved.12  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n \n8.  The  TA  scope  will  include  wetlands  in  10  ADB  DMCs  (footnote  1)  and  will  focus \nprovisionally on Cambodia, Indonesia, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. The TA will look to explore opportunities in other DMCs within the EAAF \nand will also feature collaboration with key partners to scale up the implementation of the EAAFP \nStrategic Plan, thereby supporting and enhancing ongoing wetland conservation and sustainable \nmanagement efforts in the EAAF (footnote 8). The TA will align with the ADB Natural Capital Lab, \n \n8  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): Strengthening the protected area network for migratory bird \nconservation along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) in the PRC (approved December 2020); WWF\u2019s \nAsian Flyways Initiative.

No work will be undertaken in the territory of any DMC until a no-\nobjection letter has been obtained from the government of the relevant DMC. \n \n9.  Output 1: Institutional capacity for understanding East Asian-Australasian Flyway \nwetland  values  enhanced  regionally.  This  output  will  ensure  that  local,  regional,  and \ninternational stakeholders are involved in the selection of priority wetlands and the delivery of the \nTA outputs. The TA team will build capacity and awareness of EAAF communities and decision \nmakers, highlighting the natural and socioeconomic value of wetlands, and the vision and \nobjectives set out in the EAAFP Strategic Plan to conserve and increase this value. It will assist \nthe EAAFP, governments, and development actors in identifying the knowledge and capacity \ngaps that hamper sustainable wetlands management, and in defining actions to fill these gaps \nand to expand the partnership. Key activities will be the design of a stakeholder engagement \nstrategy; delivery of stakeholder awareness-raising campaigns regionally and locally, including \ncomponents to enhance gender inclusivity during consultation as well as through long-term \nparticipation in EAAF conservation and development; assessment of capacity and knowledge \nneeds and preparation of an action plan to meet these needs; and preparation of related \nknowledge products. The TA team will draw on information from current surveys and activities in \nthe region. Consultations and knowledge exchange will take place in existing forums (including \nADB\u2019s subregional platforms, such as the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation \nProgram) and will showcase available tools such as eco-compensation (as used successfully for \nthe Jiangsu Yancheng Wetland).13  \n \n10.  Output 2: Regional Flyway Initiative investment framework for priority East Asian-\nAustralasian Flyway sites prepared. The TA team will design and implement a methodology \nfor selecting about 50 highest-priority wetland sites in the EAAF. These sites will be selected \nconsidering biodiversity values and co-benefits and will include sites where strategic investments \ncan help overcome key conservation and development challenges. The TA team will then prepare \nconcept-level investment proposals for these priority wetlands and wetland clusters to promote \nimproved nature protection and sustainable site management while enhancing the delivery of co-\nbenefits to local residents and strengthening the wider network of wetlands across the EAAF \nregion. Activities will be done in close coordination with national and local authorities; key users \nof these wetlands, such as local communities and private sector entities; donors potentially \ninterested  in  financing  the  proposals;  scientists,  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs),  and \ndevelopment organizations; and other potential stakeholders. The resulting investment portfolio \nwill be made available to governments, development partners, private sector entities, and other \ndonors or investors to select the activities that can be supported under their respective business. \nThe TA will also look to set out wider criteria for secondary wetland sites that may be supported \nby ADB and other development partners and will contribute to the wider RFI objectives and the \nEAAFP Strategy. The RFI will be launched at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties \nto the Convention on Biological Diversity (rescheduled for October 2021). \n \n11.  Output 3: Regional Flyway Initiative financing mechanism developed. The TA will \nestablish a mechanism to generate long-term financing in the form of small-to-medium funds for \nwetland biodiversity conservation and maintenance of co-benefits at highest-priority sites. In a \nfirst step the TA team will analyze case studies of existing regional or global funding mechanisms \nthat support regional and local conservation and/or social development activities, and draw \nlessons from their successes and failures.14 Based on this analysis, the team will prepare a paper \n \n13 Jiangsu Yancheng Wetlands Protection Project (Loan 2838-PRC). Link \n14 This approach has proven successful in similar initiatives such as the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. Link \n ", "4 \non the design options for a financing mechanism, to be discussed in workshops attended by \nrepresentative  governments,  wetland-dependent  communities,  CSOs,  universities,  potential \ninvestors, and private sector entities. The final design of the mechanism will be based on the \nfeedback received in the workshops and endorsed by EAAF stakeholders. It is expected that \nfunds from the mechanism will complement projects focused on priority sites by supporting site \nmaintenance,  monitoring,  data  collection,  enforcement,  and  community-based  management \ninitiatives.  Fund  recipients  are  expected  to  come  primarily  from  CSOs,  communities,  and \nacademic and research organizations. A final workshop to present the proposed financing \nmechanism and all other key TA outputs will also discuss opportunities for funding and request \ndetailed commitments from countries and development partners. \n \n12.  The TA will contribute to Pillar 3 of the Regional Cooperation and Integration Operational \nPlan with regard to regional public goods, biodiversity protection and sustainable resource \nmanagement,  and  use  of  the  EAAF  wetlands  that  form  a  transboundary  network  of  key \nimportance for waterbirds and other wetland-dependent species. The TA will support measures \nsuch as pollution control and regional capacity development, as well as actions to mitigate and/or \nadapt to climate change in the priority wetland sites. It will also support the mobilization of \nadditional financial resources for biodiversity protection and enhanced regional coordination on \nthe management of the wetland sites for which ADB provides particular value addition. \n \n13.  The TA will be delivered in close collaboration with other development agencies already \nworking on sustainable wetland management and conservation in the region, such as KfW, \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, and particularly United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP) (footnote 8). Outreach to DMCs has begun as part of TA preparation and to date included \na webinar on 16 October 2020 attended by government representatives from Cambodia, the PRC, \nand Viet Nam. Follow-up engagement was conducted with Cambodia, engagement with pertinent \nPRC authorities is scheduled for July 2021, and engagement with Viet Nam is ongoing as part of \nthe country partnership strategy process. Consultation with other DMCs will be initiated in the \nsecond half of 2021 in collaboration with staff from operational departments, and through existing \nmechanisms such as the Greater Mekong Subregion Working Group on Environment. In addition, \nengagement with CSOs has already started through the development of a stakeholder group with \nwhom an initial meeting was held on 15 December 2020.15 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which (i) $200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7) and (ii) $800,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.16 The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.
