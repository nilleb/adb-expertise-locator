Exim  Bank\u2019s  performance  highlights  its  commercial \norientation  and  the  independence  of  its  board  and  management, \nwhich enables the bank to carry out its mandate. Exim Bank has \nmaintained moderate profitability. The adverse impact of tightening \nnet interest margins over the last 4 years was effectively mitigated by \nthe bank\u2019s management through a low and further improving cost\u2013\nincome  ratio  and  a  sharply  improving  loan  portfolio,  which  kept \nnoninterest  costs  well  in  check.  Exim  Bank  is  now  uniquely  well \npositioned as a small and medium enterprise (SME) export catalyst in \na tightening long-term export finance market. \nClassification  Targeting classification: Targeted intervention\u2013geographic (Assam, \nMadhya Pradesh, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh) \nSector (subsectors): Finance (SME finance and leasing, trade \nfinance) \nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth (promoting economic \nefficiency and enabling business environment, widening access to \nmarkets and economic opportunities), regional cooperation and \nintegration (trade and investments), private sector development \n(private sector investment) \nLocation impact: Rural (high impact), urban (medium impact); national \n(high impact), regional (low impact)  \nPartnership: KfW Bankengruppe \nEnvironmental and  Environment: Category FI \nSocial Safeguards  Indigenous peoples: Category C \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nRationale  International experience suggests that trade openness has a strong \npositive association with per capita income and poverty reduction, \nalso the main focus of the global Aid for Trade initiative of the World \nTrade Organization (WTO). However, trade itself depends on global \nincome growth. In a contracting economy, a  1% decline in world \nincome leads to at least a 3% decline in trade. A 1% decline in the \nshare of trade in gross domestic product would increase the country\u2019s \npoverty rate by 0.6%. With growth becoming more Asia-driven, India \nmust  invest  now  in  structure  adjustments  to  global,  regional,  and \ndomestic shifts in market preferences. To reverse declines in India\u2019s \ntrade  volume  in  late  2008  and  early  2009,  India  has  made  the \nexpansion of market share and employment and income generation \nin its poorest regions key objectives of its foreign trade policy. The \npace  of  technological  change,  the  intensity  of  international \ncompetition,  and  the  ongoing  dispersion  and  interpenetration  of \nproductive activity along production chains in Asia have convinced \npolicy makers and entrepreneurs alike that participation in regional \nvalue  chains  and  production  clusters  and  networks  is  the  key  to ", "ii   \neconomic growth. Local SMEs in disadvantaged and poor regions \nwith  difficult  access  to  markets  must  acquire  greater  competitive \ncapacity to participate in the value chains. Although India\u2019s trade has \nalready  diversified  from  the  classic  south\u2013north  axis  through  the \nrelative expansion of south\u2013south trade and intraregional trade with \nSouth  and  Southeast  Asia,  its  income  growth  and  employment \npotential still has to be exploited. Exim Bank is a catalyst for such \nstructure adjustment to the new, emerging trade environment. \nIn  the  emerging  export  markets,  with  their  legal,  regulatory,  and \npolitical  risks,  government-supported  trade  finance  institutions  like \nExim Bank have been effective sources of finance for areas where \nthe  financial  markets  have  stayed  underdeveloped  because  of \nunfavorable  perceptions  of  risk.  While  the  market  can  normally \nprovide short-term trade finance for developed countries, long-term \ndebt financing in India\u2014in particular for export markets in emerging \neconomies\u2014is  inadequate,  as  the  Government  and  the  financial \nsector  well  recognize.  Most  commercial  banks  concentrate  on \nshort-term lending, particularly to the fast-growing consumer finance \nsector, and are typically unwilling to fund long-term trade finance \ninstruments, also called export finance instruments, from (short-term) \ndeposits. Even with a limited share in export finance, specialized \ninstitutions like Exim Bank should encourage longer-term commercial \ntrade financing for SMEs in emerging markets, in support of India\u2019s \nefforts to expand south\u2013south trade.  \nThe Facility  The facility consists of (i) a loan of up to $100,000,000 (denominated \nin  US  dollars),  and  (ii)  a  technical  assistance  grant  of  up  to \n$1,550,000  from  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB's)  Technical \nAssistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  loan,  without \ngovernment guarantee, will be supported by a partial credit guarantee \nfrom German development cooperation through KfW Bankengruppe \n(KfW) through a risk participation agreement. The loan will have a \ntenor of up to 7 years, with a grace period of 3 years, and will be \nrepaid semi-annually.  \nADB will charge an interest rate, and commitment and front-end fees \nto be determined by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. \n  Given the high growth of the medium- and long-term trade loans of \nExim  Bank,  the  proposed  facility  will  fund  the  long-term  foreign \nexchange  business  segment.  The  facility  will  be  a  strategic \npartnership, with Exim Bank assurances of increased trade within \nAsia and greater competitiveness among India\u2019s SME exporters from \nlagging  states\u2014Assam,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa,  and  Uttar \nPradesh\u2014to generate employment and income. \nTechnical Assistance  The  technical  assistance,  a  critical  component  of  the  facility,  will \nsupport  Exim  Bank  in  drafting  and  implementing  a  strategy  for \nstrengthening its role as the lead trade development agency in the \nregion.  Critical,  monitorable  parameters  are  (i)  target  SME  export ", "  iii\nmarkets,  especially  in  developing  countries  where  India  is  well \npositioned; (ii) the financing needs and risks of global value chains \nand SME production clusters originating from India; (iii) the suitability \nof Exim Bank products; (iv) the implementation of international best \npractices in environmental and social safeguards; and (v) products \ndeveloped  to  leverage  resources  through  structured  financing \ninvolving the structuring of risk layers to be borne by the Government \n(first  loss,  junior  debt),  Exim  Bank  (mezzanine  debt),  and  private \nfinance (senior debt), as well as the phasing in of Basel II principles.  \nJustification for ADB  The  financing  will  help  India  meet  its  trade  objectives,  which  are \nFacility  essential for economic growth, employment, and poverty reduction. \nInternational experience suggests a strong association between trade \nopenness  and  the  individual  incomes  of  citizens,  pointing  to  the \nsubstantial trickle-down effects generated through the producer value \nchain to small manufacturing businesses and agricultural producers. \nLong-term finance is needed to develop cross-border trade capacity. \nThe facility can be expected to employ 50,000 or more people in \nstrengthened SME export clusters, with an incremental trade volume \nof $1 billion or more over 10 years. Government support for export \nfinance  is  particularly  important  for  trade  with  emerging  markets, \nwhere  perceptions  of  higher  legal,  regulatory,  and  political  risk \nhamper the growth of the financial markets. \nThe proposed nonsovereign loan to Exim Bank is aligned with the \nvision and strategic agenda of ADB expressed in Strategy 2020. It is \nalso consistent with ADB policy to provide financial assistance without \ngovernment  guarantee  to  public  sector  enterprises  that  have \nadequate autonomy and managerial skills. As outlined in Innovation \nand Efficiency Initiative Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities \n(2005),  creditworthy  state-owned  enterprises  are  potential  ADB \nclients,  eligible  for  direct  borrowing  independent  of  sovereign \nexposure.  While  commercially  oriented,  these  entities  create \nemployment and support economic growth and income generation. \nExim Bank fits the eligibility criteria for ADB\u2019s nonsovereign financing \nfacility because of its (i) role in opening the market for medium- to \nlong-term  export  finance  to  emerging  markets  and  to  SMEs, \nespecially  in  poor  and  lagging  states;  (ii)  independent  and \ncommercially  oriented  management;  (iii)  sufficient  depth  of \nexperience in international export finance; and (iv) strong balance \nsheet,  cost  efficiency,  and  good  portfolio  quality.  In  addition,  by \nencouraging  the  participation  of  development  partners,  ADB  is \nincreasing the volume of market-based financing for Aid for Trade. \nUnder the proposed nonsovereign loan agreement, Exim Bank will \ngive its assurance that the SME export growth, employment, and \nSME cluster output targets specified in the design and monitoring \nframework will be achieved. \nThe facility will contribute in a major way to Exim Bank\u2019s institutional \ndevelopment into a modern trade financier that can leverage other \ncommercial resources into new markets, apply prudent Basel II risk \n ", "iv   \nmanagement principles, and implement an environmental and social \nsafeguard policy that allows exporter clients to maintain and improve \ntheir competitiveness and creditworthiness amid rising awareness of \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  and  other  product  quality \nstandards in international trade.   \n   \n   \n   ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  of  up  to  $100,000,000  (denominated  in  US  Dollars),  without  government  guarantee, \nsupported by a partial credit guarantee from German development cooperation through KfW \nBankengruppe (KfW); and (ii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) grant of up to $1,550,000 \nboth to Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) for the Small and Medium Enterprise Trade \nFinance Development Facility. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Characteristics and Performance \n2.  Positive association of trade, per capita income, and poverty reduction. A 1% \nincrease in the share of trade in gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to decrease a \ncountry\u2019s poverty rate by 0.6%.1 Trade openness and the increase in income and decrease in \npoverty  are  strongly  associated,  pointing  to  large  trickle-down  effects  to  small  business, \nemployment,  and  income  through  the  manufacturing  value  chain.  India  remains  a  small \nparticipant in global production networks, with only a 7% share of parts and components in total \nmanufacturing exports.2 Since fiscal year (FY) 2000, the dollar value of India\u2019s labor-intensive \nexports of agricultural produce have surged by 14% yearly, and manufactured goods by 24%, \nindicating  the  initial  integration  of  rural  areas  and  farmers,  as  well  as  small  and  medium \nenterprises  (SMEs),  into  the  global  value  chain.  Experienced  corporate  exporters  have, \nhowever, not yet established large supply networks with small businesses and farmers in rural \nIndia; thus, trade has so far not been fully effective in reducing poverty in the rural areas, \nespecially in the backward and poorer regions of India. This conclusion is consistent with the \nfindings  of  an  ADB  report  (footnote  2)  and  of  the  G8,3  the  G24,4  and  the  World  Trade \nOrganization substantiating the Aid for Trade initiative.5 In view of the present adverse global \neconomic environment for trade, and India\u2019s projected loss of up to 10 growth points in the next \n2 years as a result of the 2009 fall in export volumes, adaptation investment is needed to avert \noverly negative income and poverty effects. \n3.  The Aid for Trade support, however, is expected to overcome in the medium to long term \nthe market and governance failures that prevent SME market entry and linkages especially in \npoorer  regions.  Aid  for  Trade  support  and  investment,  for  instance,  (i)  increases  the \nmanagement and technical capacity of exporters, (ii) facilitates technology transfer and use of \nquality standards, (iii) strengthens the business environment within a more-robust regulatory \nand administrative structure, and (iv) improves trade-related infrastructure. Details on how Aid \nfor Trade overcomes market and governance failures are given in Appendix 2, Table A.2.13. \n                                                 \n1  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, ADB, and United Nations Development \nProgramme. 2008.

Export  development  cluster  and  \u201cpoverty-intensive\u201d  cluster  development \ninitiative. The Eleventh Five Year Plan 2007\u20132012 (11th plan) of the Government of India \nhighlights the importance of the cluster development initiative to the integration of backward and \nlagging regions with export markets.7 Improvements will be made in the competitiveness of over \n400  manufacturing  and  over  6,000  lower-technology  SME  \u201cpoverty-intensive\u201d  clusters,  with \nconsequent employment, income growth, and poverty reduction benefits. The highest SME \nexport development priority is assigned to clusters in lagging regions and states, which account \nfor  only  for  a  small  share  of  established  clusters.  SMEs  often  act  as  ancillaries  (indirect \nexporters) for the large-scale producers, central distributors, and lead firms along value chains, \nproviding them with vital components and backward linkages. So far, these SMEs are excluded \nfrom modern value chains. Exim Bank has been designated by the Government as the lead \nagency for the promotion of export-oriented SMEs and of lower-technology SME \u201cpoverty-\nintensive\u201d clusters. In FY2008, Exim Bank facilitated SME exports of Alphonso mangoes to \nSingapore, and seedless grapes to Dubai and the Bhagva variety of pomegranates to Dubai. \nThrough investments in trade infrastructure, technology, and long-term capacity building, Exim \nBank  also  brought  SMEs  from  various  clusters  into  the  global  value  chain  of  the  world\u2019s \nsecond-largest retailer operating stores in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, for the export of \nhome decor items, leather photo frames, and lacquered jewelry boxes. Under the proposed \nnonsovereign loan agreement, Exim Bank will give its assurance that the SME export growth, \nemployment, and SME cluster output targets specified in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1) will be achieved. \n1.  Economic Reforms  \n5.  India\u2019s trade policy. An outward-looking and liberal trade policy is one of the main \nfeatures of India\u2019s economic reforms. India intends to stimulate growth in trade, exploit its labor \nadvantage, and broaden the benefits from trade growth with more-inclusive growth. Recognizing \nthe opportunities and challenges of integration in an increasingly globalized world economy, \nIndia, under its Foreign Trade Policy 2004\u20132009, looks forward to doubling its share in world \ntrade to 2% and generating more employment by promoting labor-intensive exports. India\u2019s \ntrade  strategy  has  set  its  sights  on  (i)  rationalizing  tariffs  and  tax  rebates,  and  reducing \ntransaction costs; (ii) producing better-quality and more-reliable exports; (iii) upgrading export \ninfrastructure; and (iv) improving medium- to long-term trade finance (export finance). See \nAppendix 2 for details on the trade sector. \n6.  Economic  and  structural  reforms.  India  has  undertaken  various  economic  and \nstructural reforms following the balance-of-payments crisis in 1991 and the realization that a \nhigh degree of protection meant low economic growth and low income for the citizens. These \nreforms have  \n(i)  facilitated foreign direct investment; \n(ii)  encouraged the privatization of nonstrategic state-owned enterprises; \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2009.

The reforms not only improved the financial sector but also opened up India\u2019s markets \nby  reducing  government  controls  on  foreign  trade  and  investment,  thereby  improving  the \ncountry\u2019s position in the global market.  \n8.  Money laundering and financing of terrorism. RBI created the Committee on Bank \nFrauds in 1999 and Parliament passed the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in July 2002, \nputting in place procedures, systems, and controls to help combat money laundering. RBI \nissued  \u201cknow  your  customer\u201d  guidelines  and  instructed  banks  to  monitor  suspicious  cash \ntransactions and to report transactions of terrorist entities or of individuals or organizations \nsuspected of fronting for terrorist entities. Legal reforms include the passage of security laws \nand amendments to the Negotiable Instruments Act. RBI has also proposed comprehensive \namendments to the RBI Act (1934) and the Banking Regulation Act (1949). In addition, the \nSecuritization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act \n(2002) regulates the securitization and restructuring of financial assets, and enforces debt \nsecurity to improve creditor rights and reduce nonperforming loans. \n2.  Results of Reforms \n9.  High-growth  trajectory.  The  Indian  economy,  particularly  the  trade  sector,  has \nbenefited significantly from global trends and the reforms pursued by the Government. India\u2019s \nshare in world exports increased marginally from about 0.7% in 2001 to 1.8% in 2006, and is \nhewing to the target of close to 2% for 2009, despite the adverse global economic environment. \nExport volume tripled from 2001 to 2006, growing by 22% yearly on average, and imports grew \nby 28% yearly, to more than four times the volume in 2001. Service exports, especially in \ninformation  technology,  biotechnology,  call  centers,  and  other  administrative  outsourcing, \nincreased by an annual average of 34%, while service imports during the same period grew by \nan annual average of 22%. The dramatic surge in India\u2019s openness, especially up to 2008, is \nshown in Table 1. The ratio of merchandise exports to GDP increased from 5.8% in FY1991 to \n15.5% in FY2008, while the ratio of imports to GDP increased from 8.8% to 23.5%. India\u2019s \nexport growth (by volume) during the period, led by a surge in manufactured exports, was also \nhigher than the world average. However, because of infrastructure and political constraints, the \ntrade value chains within India have not yet tapped the poorer regions and lagging states or \nintegrated them into the global economy. The vast potential of these regions for increased trade \nis recognized. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "4   \nTable 1: India\u2019s Openness to the World Economy, 1990\u20132009 \n(% of GDP) \nItem  1990\u20131991 1995\u20131996 2000\u20132001 2005\u20132006 2007\u201320082008\u20132009\nMerchandise Trade  15  22  23  33  39  36 \nTrade in Goods and Services  17  26  29  45  48  46 \nGross Capital Transactions  12  13  22  32  44  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not applicable, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India, Report on Currency and Finance, various years. \n10.  Diversification to south\u2013south trade. Although the United States is still India\u2019s largest \ntrade partner, its importance is declining even as other Asian and even African countries are \ngaining ground. Since FY2001, the United States\u2019 share in India\u2019s trade has declined from 13% \nto 9.7%, while the PRC\u2019s share has increased from 2.5% to 7.7%. The share of the European \nUnion has decreased from 22% to 18.72%, while that of other Asian countries including the \nPacific has increased from 32.9% to 56%. Trade with the United States and Europe will remain \nvery significant, but it will grow more slowly compared with trade with new markets. India \nrecently  identified  opportunities  for  trade  with  other  countries  in  South  Asia  and  with  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), East Asia, and Africa. Figure 1 shows the \nrecent impressive growth in India\u2019s trade, especially in Asia. This is indicative of the increasing \nimportance of India in global value chains that connect Asia to North America and Europe. The \ncountry must also diversify into various product value chains to tap the trade potential of poor \nand lagging regions. Studies show that backward regions can develop and sustain such value \nchains as bamboo flooring, organic pineapple, natural rubber and rubber products, and tourism, \nall of which have substantial potential for global trade. \nFigure 1: Direction of India\u2019s Foreign Trade \n120.0  Europe  America Africa Asia Others \n100.0 \n n 80.0 \no\nbilli 60.0 \n$ \n40.0 \n20.0 \n0.0 \n1990  1995  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nFiscal Year   \nSource: Reserve Bank of India statistics, various years. \nB.

SMEs, in the 11th \nplan, are small and medium enterprises, closely along the lines of international practice; MSMEs ", "  5\nare micro, small, and medium enterprises; and MSEs are micro and small enterprises.8 These \ndefinitions have superseded the older notion of small-scale industries (SSIs), first introduced in \nIndia by the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951 (the IDR Act). The IDR Act, \nwhich has been amended several times over the years, defines SSIs in terms of investment \nlimits in plant and machinery, excluding land and buildings. An SSI unit is now defined as an \nindustrial undertaking that invests up to Rs10 million ($0.25 million) in plant and machinery, \nexcluding  land  and  buildings,  whether  on  ownership  terms  or  on  hire-purchase. 9   The \nGovernment has increased the SSI investment limit to Rs50 million ($1.23 million) in respect of \ncertain specified items under hosiery, hand tools, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and sporting \ngoods. However, medium enterprises were defined only in May 2006. The Micro, Small and \nMedium Enterprises Development Bill (MSME Bill) of 2006 classifies medium enterprises as \nentities that invest no more than Rs100 million ($2.45 million) in plant and machinery, excluding \nland  and  buildings.  Service  sectors  have  different  limits  (Table  2).  For  effective  MSME \ndevelopment, the Government amended the Government (Allocation of Business) Rules of 1961 \non 9 May 2007, merging the Ministry of Agro and Rural Industries and the Ministry of Small-\nScale Industries into a single ministry\u2014the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.  \nTable 2: Classification of Enterprises into Different Categories (New Definitions) \n  Fixed Assets Investment Ceiling (excluding land and building) \nClassification  Manufacturing  Service \nMicro  Up to Rs2,500,000   Up to Rs1,000,000  \nSmall  Rs2,500,000 to Rs50,000,000   Rs1,000,000 to Rs20,000,000  \nMedium  Rs50,000,000 to 10,000,000   Rs20,000,000 to Rs50,000,000  \nSource: Biswas, Indranil, and Milindo Chakrabarty. 2008.

As for export-oriented units, these are SSIs that export more than 50% of their output. \nTo  enable  these  units  to  meet  the  pricing,  quality,  and  precision  requirements  of  foreign \nmarkets, the Government amended its concession scheme in November 1983 and introduced \nthe concept of 100% export-oriented units. According to this scheme, a 100% export-oriented \nunit is an industrial unit that offers to export its entire production, excluding permitted sales in \nthe domestic tariff area, and that may have up to 100% foreign equity participation with certain \nconditions.10 A 100% export-oriented unit is also exempted from paying corporate tax for \n5 straight years in its first 8 years of operation, and is entitled to benefits including a special \nimport license, as well as an additional special import license of 2% of the free-on-board value \nof exports.  \n                                                 \n8  The definition of SMEs differs between countries. SMEs have been defined against various criteria such as the \nnumber of workers employed, the volume of output or sales, the value of assets employed, and the use of energy. \nSMEs, for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), are entities with no more than \n500 employees. For the Mulitilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World Bank Group, SMEs \nemploy up to 300 and have annual sales of less than $15 million. For the European Union, SMEs employ no more \nthan 250 and their annual turnover does not exceed \u20ac50 million ($70 million).  \n9  Small-scale units that invest up to Rs2.5 million in plant and machinery are classified as tiny (or micro) enterprises. \n10 Regarding their export obligations, 100% export-oriented units, among other conditions, (i) need not export their \nmanufactured goods themselves but may use an export house or trading house, (ii) must execute a bond or legal \nundertaking with the development commissioner concerned, (iii) must adhere to the minimum value-addition \nconditions (in general, at least 35% value addition for automatic approvals) stated in the letter of permission or \nindustrial license issued to them, and (iv) must keep proper records of their imports, consumption and use of \nimported materials, and exports.  \n ", "6   \n2.  Overall Performance and Export Contribution of the Small and Medium \nEnterprise Sector  \n13.  According to the 11th plan, the country\u2019s 12.8 million SMEs employed about 30 million \npeople  in  2006/2007,  and  MSMEs  employed  about  65  million,  or  about  70%  of  formal \nemployment in India.11 The sector manufactures more than 8,000 diverse products, valued \ncurrently at almost Rs8,160 billion and contributing around 40% of industrial production and \n50% (35% direct and 15% indirect) of India\u2019s exports. Thus, SMEs are an important instrument \nof inclusive growth in India, and touch on the lives of the most vulnerable, including women, \nscheduled tribes, and women and children living in urban slums and in remote villages. The SSI \nsector  has  a  significant  role  in  balanced  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  employment \ngeneration, entrepreneurial skills development, and export earnings. The target growth rate for \nSMEs under the 11th plan is 12%, 2\u20133 percentage points higher than the target growth rate for \nthe entire industries sector. \n14.  The comparative advantage of small firms lies in their greater share of value added from \nlabor\u2014especially semiskilled and skilled labor, and, in the Indian context, even unskilled labor \n(without completely overcoming disguised unemployment). MSMEs employ 1.39 employees per \nunit of investment, compared with 0.2 employees for the same unit of investment in large \nindustries  (Table  3  reference).  Besides,  manufacturing  is  the  most  tradable  of  all  sectors, \nespecially when the goods meet international quality standards, are competitive, and have long \nshelf lives. Successful industrializing economies (especially late industrializers and densely \npopulated industrializing economies) show the crucial role of labor-intensive manufacturing in \nthe transformation of the economy. The reason is easy to see: the social price of labor is \ntechnically zero when this factor is in surplus. Since small firms have competitive advantage in \nlabor-intensive  manufacturing,  significant  export  promotion  initiatives  are  clearly  impossible \nwithout  small  firms  in  a  dominant  role.  Small  firms  also  complement  large  firms  through \nsupply-chain relationships and subcontracting.  \n3.  Small and Medium Enterprise Clusters for the Inclusion of Poor States and \nLagging Regions \n15.  The 11th plan of the Government highlights the importance of the cluster development \ninitiative to the integration of backward and lagging regions with export markets. Over 400 \nmanufacturing and over 6,000 lower-technology SME \u201cpoverty-intensive\u201d clusters will undergo \nimprovements in competitiveness, with consequent benefits to employment, income growth, and \npoverty reduction. Clusters in the lagging regions and states of India, which account only for a \nsmall  share  of  established  clusters,  have  the  highest  priority  in  SME  export  development. \nTable 3 shows that Eastern India has only 9% of manufacturing clusters, and that the poor \nstates have none. The East and the poor states are similarly underrepresented when it comes \nto MSME clusters. Hence, the Government views financing and capacity building of SMEs in \nthese lagging regions as important for their inclusion in global trade links. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India. 2009. \nSearchable Database for Exportable Technologies from SMEs of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.  http://dsir.nic.in/reports/ \nExpTechTNKL/Abs%20new/1INTRODUCTION.htm  ", "  7\nTable 3: Indian Small and Medium Enterprises Clusters, by Region  \n(%) \n  Traditional  Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises \nRegion  Manufacturing  Handicrafts  Handlooms  Others \nNorth  31.7  25.7  23.6  24.1 \nEast  9.3  23.2  7.2  16.0 \nWest  36.1  27.5  22.6  27.2 \nSouth  22.9  18.1  36.0  29.6 \nPoor states  0.0  5.5  10.6  3.1 \nTotal  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0 \nSource: Compiled from the Directorate of Handicraft and Handlooms; the United Nations Industrial \nDevelopment Organization; and the third census of SSI units, 2001\u20132002. \n4.  Financing for Small and Medium Enterprises \n16.  At the end of FY2007, only about 8% of bank lending was going to SSIs. In FY2005, \nSSIs derived 73% of their financing from public sector banks (Rs676 billion, Rs27.7 billion of this \nfrom the Small Industries Development Bank of India [SIDBI] through its indirect assistance \nscheme). Table 4 gives a snapshot of the total credit outstanding to the SSI sector. \nTable 4: Total Credit Outstanding to the Small-Scale Industry Sector \n(Rs billion) \nItem  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005 \nPublic Sector Banks  529.88  583.11  676.34 \nIndian Private Banks  68.57  75.90  86.68 \nForeign Banks  40.10  53.07  69.14 \nSIDBI  19.50  91.22  100.84 \nTotal  658.05  803.30  933.00 \nFY = fiscal year, SIDBI = Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n  Source: Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n17.  As of March 2006, outstanding credit to the SSI sector totaled more than Rs1,000 billion \n($25 billion). Banks have been the major source of credit for the sector (both SSI and medium \nenterprises) over the years. However, since nonperforming assets in the SSI segment are \nhighest for banks, the proportion of SSI loans to net bank credit has been declining, from 15% in \n2003 to about 8% in 2006.  \n5.  Policies to Stimulate the Flow of Credit to Small and Medium Enterprises \n18.  SMEs need working capital and term loans.12 Realizing the credit needs of the SSI \nsector, the Government has devised policies to increase the flow of credit to SMEs under \npriority sector lending programs. These policies require banks to direct a defined percentage \n(currently  40%)  of  their  overall  lending  to  priority  sectors  identified  by  the  Government.  \nAgriculture, small industries, and exports are priority sectors under these policies. \n19.  Several committees have been formed to help ease the flow of credit to the SSI sector. \nThe Nayak committee set up by RBI dealt with the adequacy and timeliness of credit to SSIs. \nThe committee estimated SSI working capital at 8.1% (FY2005 and FY2006) of annual output, \nfar below the normal requirement of 20%, and recommended that working capital for the SSI \n                                                 \n12 Credit becomes even more critical when a large-volume order is placed, a consignment is rejected, payment is \ninordinately delayed, or some other episodic event occurs. \n ", "8   \nsector be made equivalent to 20% of annual projected turnover.13 The Ganguly committee \nassessed the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations of the Kapur and \nGupta committees and emphasized the need for credit intermediaries dedicated to SME and \ntrade financing. Such credit intermediaries would absorb credit risk and extend quick credit to \nSME clusters, including export clusters, accredited to them.14  \n20.  As recommended by these committees, the Government undertook several initiatives \nincluding uncoupling SIDBI from Industrial Development Bank of India, opening specialized \nbranches for SME lending,15 increasing the limits of composite loans from Rs0.2 million to \nRs0.5 million, setting up debt recovery tribunals, introducing a credit guarantee scheme, and \nraising the exemption limit for collateral security from Rs25,000 to Rs0.5 million. Further, the \ninternal  group  formed  by  RBI  to  review  the  guidelines  for  SME  credit  to  the  SME  sector \nrecommended  that  commercial  banks  set  their  own  lending  targets  for  the  sector,  with \ndisbursements increasing yearly. The internal group also recommended the continuation of \nsub-targets for the financing of tiny units (up to 40%) and smaller units (20%). The finance \nminister, in a statement in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Parliament) on 10 August 2005, \nproposed the implementation of the recommendations of the internal group. He fixed a 20% \nminimum  growth  in  credit  to  SME  sector  to  double  the  flow  of  credit  to  the  sector  from \nRs676 billion in FY2004\u2013FY2005 to Rs1,350 billion by FY2009\u2013FY2010. However, as already \nmentioned, SMEs at the end of FY2007 were attracting only 8.1% of bank credit. On 6 June \n2007, a group under an executive director of Exim Bank and comprising representatives from \nthe Government\u2019s Department of Commerce, commercial banks, SIDBI, trade bodies, and three \ndepartments in RBI was created to assess the credit needs of MSME exporters. After extensive \ndeliberations, the group recommended that 50% of export credit be earmarked for the MSME \nsector by all banks including foreign banks. Banks with a lower MSME portfolio in their total \nexport credit portfolio could be given a specific period by RBI, depending on each case, to \nachieve the proposed lending. RBI has since forwarded the report to the Government and will \nissue suitable guidelines once the Government gives its approval. Appendix 2 discusses the \nevolution of the Government\u2019s policies and trade reforms to promote SME growth and credit \nflow.  Such  policies  and  reforms  have  assumed  utmost  significance  in  the  difficult  global \neconomic environment at present. \nC.  Challenges and Opportunities \n1.  Severe Deceleration in Trade Growth \n21.  As  a  consequence  of  the  global  economic  crisis,  the  Government  is  challenged  to \nintensify structural economic reforms and to improve the export performance especially of the \nSME segment of the economy. The Government now gives priority to eliminating the income \nand poverty effects of economic deceleration, by providing more long-term finance to SME \nexporters and by strengthening the strategic development role of Exim Bank in SME capacity \nbuilding and technology investment. \n                                                 \n13 The Kapur committee set up by RBI to review the delivery of working capital also recommended that SSI units get \nat least 20% of the value of their output. \n14 The Ganguly committee also recommended that novel funding schemes for SMEs be introduced especially in \nbackward regions and areas to remove regional imbalances. \n 15 Public sector banks have been advised to operate more specialized SSI branches in centers where the financing \nneeds of many SSI borrowers can be served. To moderate the cost of credit to SSI units, banks have been \ndirected to grant lower spreads over the prime lending rate to SSI units with a good borrowing record. ", "  9\n2.  Need to Tap Further Trade Potential \n22.  Government recognition of the need to act in concert with the private sector. \nRecognition of India\u2019s tremendous potential to become a global economic player is gaining. The \ncountry,  with  its  rich  natural  resource  and  mineral  base,  is  now  the  world\u2019s \n10th most industrialized in terms of overall industrial production. Banking on the demographic \nadvantage of a large working-age population, India offers the advantage of cheaper labor. It \ntherefore has immense capacity to deliver a wide array of products and services to the global \nmarket.  The  Government  is  taking  action  to  remove  infrastructure  and  administrative \nbottlenecks  in  production  and  trade.  It  is  (i) simplifying  and  rationalizing  tariff  and  custom \nprocedures for exports and imports, (ii) reducing restrictions and encouraging competition in the \nindustrial  sector,  (iii) aligning  standards  and  products  with  international  norms,  and \n(iv) developing infrastructure facilities with the participation of the private sector and SMEs. \n23.  Need for better positioning in the international value chain. The trade centrality \nindex in Figure 2 illustrates an economy\u2019s positioning in global value chains and trade networks. \nA high trade centrality value (on a scale of 0\u2013100) reflects a central position of influence within \nkey global supply and value chains. South Asia is still relatively marginally integrated into the \nglobal value chain compared with Germany, Japan, and the United States. India is still a small \nparticipant in global production networks, with only a 7% share of parts and components in total \nmanufacturing exports (footnote 2). \nFigure 2: Trade Centrality Index \nThailand \nPakistan \nNepal \n \nry Indonesia \nt\nn\nu India \no\nC Bangladesh \nPRC \nJapan \nGermany \nUnited States \n0  10 20 30 40 50 60 70   90  100\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Adapted from Kali and Reyes. 2006. Background Paper on South Asia, prepared by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank for Mobilizing Aid for Trade: Focus Asia and the Pacific. \n3.  Need to Prevent Exclusion of Small and Medium Enterprises, Small Farmer \nAgro-exporters, and Poor and Lagging Regions from Value Chains \n24.  Contract  manufacturing  and  production.  This important mechanism, whereby the \nprivate sector can establish linkages between SMEs, small-farmer agro-business exports, and \nmarkets, requires effective contracting and dispute resolution, along with adequate information \nchannels and contract support, to allow SMEs to enter into collective contracts. SMEs do not \n ", "10   \nhave funds for market research and, on their own, cannot improve design and technical and \nquality standards to keep up with increasingly complex market demands. \n25.  Value chain integration leads away from spot purchases by lead firms to the use of \nspecialized procurement agents that can bypass wholesale markets. This shift is made to \nreduce transaction costs and obtain enough control over quantities, delivery, and quality that \ncannot be obtained through the spot market. The key to incorporating SMEs into value chains is \nthe development of mechanisms to ensure that the SME products and services meet the size, \nappearance, safety, quantity, quality, and other requirements of the customer. \n4.  Importance of Long-Term Trade Finance (Export Finance) for Poor States \nand Lagging Regions and Trade \n26.  Improving the trade and investment environment for SMEs in poor states and backward \nregions is a challenging task. The Government has carefully identified areas for trade reform \nand is addressing these gradually. More importantly, it has identified the growth potential of \nemerging markets, especially in Asia, and is making active use of demand stimulated in these \nregions. Export finance instruments are essential for the effective growth of trade.  \n27.  Underdeveloped markets for trade finance. The experience of many developed and \ndeveloping countries suggests that commercial banks can provide short-term trade finance \n(especially post-shipment finance) for manufactured goods and services, given the short-term \nfinancing need, which normally does not exceed 180 days from shipment. Pre-shipment finance \nis riskier because the production and prefinancing periods may be longer. The financing of \nexports and imports of capital goods is normally challenging for commercial banks since the \nlong  gestation  requires  financing  tenors  that  cannot  be  easily  matched  with  their  funding \nstructure. Finally, export markets, particularly the emerging markets, are associated with high \ncredit risk because of uncertainty and information asymmetry over legislation, political stability, \nand business practice in the destination countries.  \n28.  Meeting the market gap. Exim Bank is uniquely mandated to develop export markets in \nIndia and leverage banking sector trade finance. Consistent with international good practice, the \nGovernment established Exim Bank to spearhead trade finance in areas where the market is \nundeveloped by commercial banks. While commercial banks\u2019 volume of bills discounted is only \nabout 2% of their credit outstanding, their export credit, at about Rs1.1 billion in FY2007, is \nmore than double the FY2003 figure, although its share in overall bank credit has been reduced \nfrom about 8% to 6%. Also in FY2003\u2013FY2007, Exim Bank doubled its share of overall export \ncredit,  from  4%  to  8%.  The  demand  for  foreign  currency  financing  of  export  credit  has \nincreased, concurrent with exporters\u2019 modernization efforts, such as efforts to integrate into \nglobal value chains, raising the proportion of export credit financed with foreign exchange from \nabout 15% in FY2007 to over 40% in FY2005.  \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n29.  ADB's extensive support for Aid for Trade and the financial sector is in the context of \nsustained policy dialogue at various levels of Government. Substantive assessment was carried \nout for the trade sector and export finance market analysis. ADB has been in dialogue with key \nSME lending institutions such as SIDBI, State Bank of India, and Exim Bank over the last four \nyears. Given the importance of SME exporters in the context of Aid for Trade and its credit \nstrength, ADB has given its prioirty to support Exim Bank and to keep up the dialogue with State ", "  11\nBank of India for later transactions.16 ADB has led efforts to establish the Environmental and \nSocial Management Sytstem (ESMS) to ensure compliance with ADB and national environment \nand social safeguard norms. \n6.  Value Added and Rationale for ADB Assistance \n30.  Regional integration through aiding trade for the benefit of poorer regions is a means for \ninclusive growth.17 Aid for Trade refers to trade-related capacity building to help countries \nformulate, negotiate, and implement trade policy and related agreements, as well as trade \ndevelopment, including export promotion and export finance. It also covers support for activities \nto  strengthen  trade-related  infrastructure  and  other  supply-side  capacity  (in  the  productive \nsector, among others) and trade-related adjustment programs (policy reform and adjustments, \nsocial safety nets, etc.).18  \n31.  Realizing the economic disparities between the two faces of Asia and the Pacific and \nADB\u2019s long experience in trade-related development, the Aid for Trade initiative is poised to be \na  core  area  of  ADB  assistance  in  this  region.  The  five  core  areas  where  assistance  will \ngenerally be needed are:  \n(i)  Trade-related infrastructure. Transport logistics along value chains, energy, and \ncommunications are the most obvious.  \n(ii)  Productive  capacity  to  draw  countries  into  production  chains  and  supply \nnetworks, whether regional or global.  \n(iii)  Adjustment  programs.  New  demand  and  economic  growth  require \nmarket-oriented  reforms,  the  development  of  social  safety  nets,  and  worker \nretraining to ease the transition.  \n(iv)  Trade development, including export promotion and export finance.  \n(v)  Trade  capacity  building  to  help  developing  member  countries  negotiate  and \nimplement trade agreements.  \n32.  The increasing globalization of value chains presents both risks and opportunities. The \nlagging regions will be able to exploit their advantage of natural and agro-based resources and \nlabor  only  if  improvements  are  made  in  the  quality,  type,  and  volume  of  value  chain \ninfrastructure and export finance to match the needs of rapidly developing markets. While \nExim Bank is a key financier in Indian export finance, it must increase its role in expanding the \nreach of export finance to high-potential SMEs in the more disadvantaged regions of India. \nConsistent  with  being  the  market  leader,  Exim  Bank  must  constantly  endeavor  to  identify \nproducts of underdeveloped markets and segments. Its past business growth indicates its \nlimitations to do so on its own; it must therefore find new ways to enlarge the resources \navailable for export finance.  \n33.  The proposed nonsovereign loan to Exim Bank is aligned with the vision and strategic \nagenda of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) expressed in Strategy 2020. It is also consistent \nwith ADB policy to provide financial assistance without government guarantee to public sector \nenterprises that have adequate autonomy and managerial skills. As outlined in Innovation and \nEfficiency Initiative Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities (2005), creditworthy state-owned \n                                                 \n16  ADB is currently working closely with SIDBI for a potential partial credit gurantee operations.  \n17 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n18  United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Mobilizing Aid for Trade: Focus Africa. \nhttp://www.uneca.org/aidfortrade/. \n ", "12   \nenterprises are potential ADB clients, eligible for direct borrowing independent of sovereign \nexposure. While commercially oriented, these entities create employment and support economic \ngrowth and income generation. Exim Bank fits the eligibility criteria for ADB\u2019s nonsovereign \nfinancing facility because of its (i) role in opening the market for medium- to long-term export \nfinance  to  emerging  markets  and  to  SMEs,  especially  in  poor  and  lagging  states;  (ii) \nindependent  and  commercially  oriented  management;  (iii)  sufficient  depth  of  experience  in \ninternational export finance; and (iv) strong balance sheet, cost efficiency, and good portfolio \nquality. Under the proposed nonsovereign loan agreement, Exim Bank will give its assurance \nthat the SME export growth, employment, and SME cluster output targets specified in the \ndesign and monitoring framework will be achieved. \n \n34.  At the same time, Exim Bank will review and reform its risk management system to fit \nthe  Basel  II  framework  to  improve  its  standing  in  the  market.  The  facility  implements  an \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  policy  that  will  help  maintain  and  improve  the \ncompetitiveness and creditworthiness of Exim Bank exporter clients in the context of rising \nenvironmental, social safeguard, and other product quality standards in international trade. It will \nalso build more technical capability to help its clients stay competitive in the new, emerging \ntrade environment.  \nIII.  THE BORROWER \nA.  Mandate and Ownership \n35.  Established under section 3 of the Export-Import Bank of India Act of 1981 (28 of 1981) \n(Exim Bank Act), Exim Bank is mandated to finance, facilitate, and promote India\u2019s international \ntrade. It provides export credit and loans to corporate exporters (including working capital, \nproject finance, equipment finance, credit to buyers and suppliers, and international investment) \nand refinances commercial banks\u2019 trade finance, export guarantees, and advisory services to \nexporters. Exim Bank also manages about 70 credit lines based on bilateral trade agreements \nof the Government with developing export markets worldwide.19  \nB.  Organization Structure and Corporate Governance \n36.  Board of directors. Under section 5(1) of the Exim Bank Act, the board of directors of \nExim Bank oversee, direct, and manage its affairs and business. The board, which includes an \nRBI representative, follows RBI guidelines for the prudential supervision of commercial banks. \nAs part of its off-site surveillance, RBI\u2019s department of banking supervision assembles financial \ninformation on Exim Bank and monitors its performance including its asset classification, income \nrecognition and provisioning, capital adequacy (now being adjusted to Basel II norms), asset\u2013\nliability management, and borrower and sector exposure. The Exim Bank Act vests in the board \nmajor  prudential  supervision  and  rule-making  powers  to  guide  the  policies  and  day-to-day \nbusiness of the bank. The board comprises a chair and managing director appointed by the \ncentral Government and up to 15 members who represent the RBI, the Export Credit and \nGuarantee Corporation, the Industrial Development Bank of India, and up to three scheduled \nbanks,  as  well  as  five  officials  of  the  central  Government  and  up  to  four  professionals \nexperienced in trade and export finance. As of 31 March 2009, the chair and managing director \nwas supported by 11 other board members including the chairpersons of the State Bank of \nIndia, the Bank of Baroda, and the Punjab National Bank (all public sector banks).  \n                                                 \n19 Exim Bank manages the Government\u2019s Export Development Fund as a separate legal entity and provides macro \ntrade policy advice to the Government. ", "  13\n37.  Under the Exim Bank Act, the board has formed committees to set key policies of the \nbank and oversee its operations. The board management committee, made up of the chair and \nnot more than seven directors, oversees Exim Bank\u2019s daily business. The board has delegated \noversight authority to (i) the committee of executives, comprising executive directors, chief \ngeneral managers, and general managers, who approve certain day-to-day business; (ii) the \nintegrated risk management committee, a senior management committee that oversees the \ncredit risk management committee and the asset\u2013liability management committee; and (iii) the \naudit committee (which comprised five directors as of 31 March 2009).  \nC.  Business Lines and Strategy \n38.  As mandated, Exim Bank is the Government\u2019s financing instrument in support of its trade \npolicy. Despite its policy role, Exim Bank has shown remarkable independence and commercial \norientation in its business, as shown by moderate profitability, improving asset quality, and \nfavorable  cost\u2013income  ratio.  Exim  Bank  over  the  last  5  years  has  significantly  expanded \ngovernment-funded  lines  of  credit  to  India\u2019s  emerging-market  trade  partners,  which  now \nconstitute 13% of its total assets. Over the same period Exim Bank has also expanded its share \nof refinancing through financial institutions and banks from 14% to 21% of total assets, and its \ntrade finance portfolio has grown in proportion to the bank\u2019s overall asset growth, by an average \nof 23% yearly since FY2004. As a result, the overall loan portfolio of the bank has grown faster \n(by 26% yearly) than overall assets, indicating a decline in other assets and investments, \nespecially  liquidity.  Equity  investments  have  remained  moderate,  at  1%  of  total  assets \nthroughout the period.  \n39.  Since FY2004, the approval values of export contracts supported by Exim Bank have \nsurged by 35% yearly. During the same period, the number of exporters and export countries \nhas doubled, indicating strong diversification of risks. Loan approvals in FY2009 amounted to \nRs336 billion, while disbursements grew by 7% to Rs289 billion, reflecting a sharp increase in (i) \nplant turnkey contracts, which have increased almost 7 times in value over the last 4 years; and \n(ii)  construction  contracts,  whose  value  has  increased  almost  8.5  times  over  that  period. \nGovernment-supported programs for technology upgrading more than doubled Exim Bank\u2019s \nbusiness to 10% of overall approvals during the same period, and international investment \nfinance increased its share to 7% of total approvals in FY2009. SME and agribusiness export \nfinancing is growing fast, but from a small scale. Export credit has continued to be the dominant \nbusiness, with 48% of approvals in FY2009.  \n40.  Under the proposed facility, Exim Bank will undertake a major strategic review of its \noperations including a review of market needs, the identification of risk-sharing arrangements \nwith the Government and the market, and the introduction of corporate environmental and social \nresponsibility into its lending. Some corporate functions may have to be realigned in the coming \nyears to ensure that Exim Bank is well positioned to serve the changing and diversified needs of \nthe trade finance markets.  \nIV.  THE PROPOSED FACILITY \n41.  The proposed facility consists of (i) a loan of up to $100,000,000 (denominated in \nUS dollars) and (ii) a TA grant of up to $1,550,000.  \n ", "14   \nA.  The Loan \n42.  The  proposed  loan,  without  government  guarantee,  will  come  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources. KfW (currently rated AAA) will provide a partial credit guarantee of up to $50 \nmillion of amounts outstanding under the ADB loan. ADB\u2019s net exposure to the risk of Exim \nBank will therefore be reduced by KfW\u2019s risk participation. \n43.  The loan will be unsecured and will have a tenor of up to 7 years, with an availability \nperiod  of  12  months  and  seminannual  repayments  starting  3  years  from  the  date  of  first \ndisbursement.  It  will  be  subject  to  conditions  precedent  to  disbursements,  including  all \nnecessary government and shareholder approvals and consent, and all contractual and financial \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  loan  agreement  will  provide  for  appropriate \n(i) representations  and  warranties;  (ii)  covenants  (affirmative,  negative,  financial,  and \ninformation); and (iii) events of default.  \n44.  ADB will enter into a risk participation agreement with KfW, under which KfW will agree \nto pay ADB 50% of any unpaid amount due from Exim Bank to ADB in the event of default. \n45.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  Exim  Bank  will  be  used  for  the  bank\u2019s  medium-  and \nlong-term lending (except for programs funded out of the government budget) to its SME clients. \nADB will monitor lending to SMEs, by region and market, and by cluster location. The loan \ndocumentation will include appropriate covenants requiring Exim Bank to target export SMEs \nincorporated in the states of Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh. Exim Bank \nwill ensure that the loan proceeds will be used to finance goods and services from ADB member \ncountries. ADB will require periodic reporting. \n46.  Environmental and social safeguards. The loan is classified as category FI under \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  as  category  C  under  both  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  Exim  Bank  will  be \nrequired to establish an environmental and social management system following the guidelines \nin Appendix 3 and setting out detailed screening and assessment procedures, and the system \nwill  be  reviewed  by  ADB.  As  described  further  below,  the  TA  will  support  Exim  Bank  in \nestablishing the environmental and social management system. In addition, Exim Bank will \ncovenant not to use the loan proceeds to finance activities that are on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited \ninvestment activities. \n47.  Anticorruption policy. Exim Bank was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof Terrorism (2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency,  ADB  will  require  Exim  Bank  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant \nwith ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The financing documentation between ADB \nand Exim Bank will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \nB.  The Technical Assistance Grant \n48.  The capacity development technical assistance (TA) for the trade finance development \nfacility will support Exim Bank in drafting and implementing a strategy for positioning the bank \nover the next 5 years (Appendix 4). Critical parameters of the strategy are as follows: (i) ", "  15\ntargeting SME export markets, especially in developing countries where India is well positioned; \n(ii) identifying the financing needs and risks of global value chains originating from India; (iii) \nassessing  the  suitability  of  Exim  Bank  products;  (iv)  developing  approaches  to  leveraging \nresources through structured financing involving the structuring of risk layers to be borne by the \nGovernment (first loss, junior debt), Exim Bank (mezzanine debt), and private finance (senior \ndebt), as well as the phasing in of Basel II principles; and (v) introducing an environmental and \nsocial responsibility policy. The TA will therefore help strengthen Exim Bank\u2019s role as the lead \ndevelopment agency for export finance, thereby facilitating private sector entry into the export \nmarkets.  \n49.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,550,000 equivalent (in Indian rupees). ADB will \nprovide a grant of (up to) $1,550,000 from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other \nsources). Exim Bank will contribute (in kind) an amount of $1,000,000 equivalent for staff, office \naccommodation, and logistical support. The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from the \ntime the TA takes effect. It will be overseen by a dedicated senior team appointed by and \nreporting to the Exim Bank chair and managing director and the board. A firm will be selected \nunder the quality-based method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.20 \nV.  BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits, Impact, and Asian Development Bank Value Addition \n50.  High  development  impact.  The  proposed  facility  will  help  India  meet  its  trade \ndevelopment objectives, for sustained economic growth. With the facility, 50,000 or more jobs \nwill be created in SME export clusters in lagging regions, with at least $1 billion in incremental \nexport production in an increasing variety of products. International experience suggests a \nstrong  association  between  a  country\u2019s  trade  openness  and  the  individual  incomes  of  its \ncitizens, pointing to the substantial trickle-down effects of trade through the producer value \nchain to small manufacturing businesses and agricultural producers. This is consistent with the \nfindings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (footnote 1) and the G8, \nG24, and WTO, indicating that Aid for Trade is an effective tool for poverty reduction. The \nbenefits  from  trade  are  most  visible  in  a  context  where  regulatory  reform  and  process \nsimplification go hand in hand with the building of trade infrastructure and capacity. The role of \ngovernment support for export finance is particularly important for SME trade with emerging \nmarkets, which is exposed to higher legal, regulatory, and political risks (Appendix 5), especially \nin the difficult global market environment at present. The link of export finance and capacity \nbuilding support will increase SME market access and economic opportunities especially in \nAsia. \n51.  Public  good  provision  for  regional  integration  of  India's  SME  exporters.  The \nexpansion of export credit and finance will provide modernizing exporters with a reliable source \nof financing for medium- and long-term investments in skills, plant, and technology. It will also \nfacilitate the extension of existing value chains to SMEs and producers of export components \nand  inputs,  as  well  as  expansion  into  new  markets.  Indian  producers  still  have  limited \ncontribution to global value chains, but there is vast potential for strengthening their position and \nvalue added. The benefits of strengthening forward integration value chains through export \nfinance are especially large. Southeast Asia and East Asia provide some of the best prospects \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "16   \nfor forward integration for India\u2019s producers, since these constitute the middle segment that links \nSoutheast Asia to the markets of the European Union, Japan, and the United States. Hence, \nExim  Bank\u2019s  expansion  of  export  credit  to  SME  suppliers  that  deliver  to  Southeast  Asian \nnetworks will have immediate benefits for India\u2019s export competitiveness. SME exporters will be \nable to adjust to a shift to trade that is more Asia-driven than in the past. \n52.  Mobilization  of  long-term  export  finance  for  trade  diversifications  decreases \neconomic vulnerability. The facility will improve Exim Bank\u2019s ability to lend long-term foreign \ncurrency funds to Indian exporters that match their cash flow. It supports the Government\u2019s \nstrategy of diversifying trade into new emerging countries, with a particular emphasis on South \nAsia and East Asia, and widening the products and industry sectors covered. It is in line with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and the country strategy for India to promote trade and financial sector \ndevelopment. The loan will be without a government guarantee and will therefore reduce the \nburden of contingent liabilities and budget constraints associated with government-funded or \nguaranteed borrowing.  \n53.  ADB's  involvement  improves  Exim  Bank  corporate  governance,  financial  risk \nmanagement, strengthens environment and social safeguards, and leads Exim Bank's \nstrategic reorientation towards developing new market segments. The facility will be a \nmajor contribution to Exim Bank\u2019s institutional development. It will enable the bank to position \nitself as a modern trade financier leveraging other commercial resources into new markets.The \nabsence of long-term export finance leads to suboptimal allocation of private sector investment \nto SME export capacity expansion and technology improvement. The facility applies prudent \nBasel II risk management to Exim Bank market opening, and implements an environmental and \nsocial  safeguard  policy  that  will  help  to  maintain  and  improve  the  competitiveness  and \ncreditworthiness of Exim Bank exporter clients in the context of rising environmental, social \nsafeguard, and other product quality standards in international trade.  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n54.  No-objection letter. The Government has confirmed that it has no objection to the \nproposed financing for Exim Bank.  \n55.  Loan  documentation.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, after the proposed financing is approved by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors.  \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n56.

Per capita growth in 2009 will be \nnegative (Tables A2.1 and A2.2). It is also estimated that a 1% decline in world growth leads to \nat least a 3% decline in trade, for a multiplier effect of 3 from world growth to trade.  \nTable A2.1: World Output Growth, 1991\u20132008 \n(% annual change in constant 2000 prices) \nEconomy  1991\u20132000a  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007b  2008c  2009c \nWorld  2.9  1.5  1.8  2.6  4.1  3.4  4.0  3.8  3.4  (1.4) \nDeveloped Countries  2.5  1.1  1.2  1.8  3.1  2.4  3.0  2.5  1.6  (3.8) \nEastern Europe, \nCentral Asia  (4.2)  5.9  5.2  7.1  7.7  6.4  7.5  8.4  7.4  (5.0) \nRussian Federation  (4.7)  5.1  4.7  7.3  7.2  6.4  6.7  8.1  7.5  (6.5) \nDeveloping Countries  5.0  2.6  3.8  5.1  7.1  6.5  6.9  7.3  6.4  1.5 \nAfrica  2.7  3.7  3.4  4.9  5.3  5.3  5.9  5.8  6.0  1.8 \nLatin America, \nCaribbean  3.2  0.3  (0.5)  2.1  6.2  4.8  5.7  5.7  4.6  (2.6) \nMexico  3.1  (0.0)  0.8  1.4  4.2  3.0  4.8  3.2  2.8  \u2014 \nBrazil  2.9  1.3  2.7  1.1  5.7  2.9  3.7  5.4  4.8  1.8 \nAsia  6.5  3.5  5.9  6.5  7.8  7.4  7.6  8.1  7.2  5.5 \nEast Asia  8.5  5.0  7.3  6.9  8.2  7.8  8.4  9.1  8.1  \u2014 \nPRC  12.4  8.3  9.1  10.0  10.1  10.2  10.7  11.4  10.0  7.5 \nSouth Asia  5.3  4.4  4.7  7.0  7.7  8.0  7.9  8.5  7.0  4.8 \nIndia  6.0  5.0  4.0  7.1  8.5  9.2  9.2  9.7  7.6  5.4 \nSoutheast Asia   5.1  2.1  4.8  5.4  6.6  5.7  6.0  6.4  5.4  0.7 \nWest Asia  3.9  (0.9)  3.5  5.4  7.8  6.9  5.5  5.1  5.7  \u2014 \n(  ) = negative, \u2014 = not available, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \na  Average.  \nb  Preliminary estimates. \nc  Forecast. \nSource: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 2008.

In this unfavorable economic climate, developing \neconomies will temporarily forgo strong growth in employment, which characterized the 2003\u2013\n2007 period. With stagnating per capita GDP growth comes employment stagnation and a move \ntoward increased informal employment. Poverty rates are likely to nudge upward in 2009 in \ndeveloping Asia, including India. \n5.  Growth of world trade. Since 2001, world trade volume has been positively influenced \nby continued strong demand from developed economies and a surging demand from developing \ncountries. After years of decline, demand surged in Southeast Europe and Central Asia as well \nas Africa. Asia, especially East, South, and West Asia, witnessed a very strong surge in import \ndemand and exports at more than double the average growth in world trade volume, driven by \nthe performance of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India (Table A2.3). This picture, \nof course, has changed in 2009, with exports and imports combined in double-digit decline \nworldwide (OECD estimates, July 2009). As the gearing ratio of world income growth decrease \nto world trade volume decrease is at least 1 to 3, India\u2019s openness to the world economy will \ndecline in 2009 by an estimated 2%\u20133%. Simulation indicates that a 1% increase (or decline) in \nthe share of trade in GDP is expected to decrease (or increase) the country poverty rate by \n0.6%. India has to invest now in structural adjustments to global, regional, and domestic shifts in \nmarket preferences, with growth and trade becoming more Asia-driven in the future. \nTable A2.3: Annual Average Growth of Goods Trade Volume, 2001\u20132006 \n(%) \nExports \nEconomy  Exports  Imports  Exports  Imports   and Imports \nWorld  5.7  6.0  2.1  2.2  (16.0) \nDeveloped Economies  4.7  4.7  0.0  (1.1)  (15.6) \nEastern Europe and Central Asia  7.3  16.2  4.5  15.5  \u2014 \nDeveloping Economies  8.7  9.0  4.8  6.3  \u2014 \nAfrica   3.5  8.3  3.6  10.5  \u2014 \nLatin America, Caribbean  4.0  4.7  4.1  3.6  (23.8) \nEast Asia  15.7  11.2  5.3  4.4   \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China   24.8  19.3  6.2  10.6   \nSouth Asia   9.3  11.3  3.9  21.3  (16.4) \nIndia   13.8  13.3  \u2014  \u2014   \nSoutheast Asia   7.2  6.2  \u2014  \u2014   \nWest Asia   4.3  12.5  3.9  8.5   \n(  ) = negative. \u2014 = not available \nSources: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). 2007.

Trade and Development Report. Geneva. \n8.  Growth of intraregional trade. The emergence of intraregional trade in Asia over the \npast 5 decades as the third hub of world trade next to Europe and North America has followed a \ndistinctive  pattern.  Following  Japan\u2019s  export  success  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  newly \nindustrializing economies began to enter export markets as Japan\u2019s industrial structure shifted \naway from labor-intensive products to more sophisticated ones. As profitability fell at home, \nproducers from Japan and the newly industrializing economies began to move their production \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nchains into Southeast Asia in the 1980s. At the same time, rapid advances in production, \ntransport,  and  communications  technology  created  opportunities  for  investors  to  redesign \nproduction processes in the 1990s and 2000s, in ways that encouraged the splitting up of \nfabrication and assembly processes. In developing countries, members of the ASEAN have the \nhighest share of intraregional trade, with a weighted average of 75%. East and Southeast Asian \ncountries accounted for almost 50% of total ASEAN trade in 2005, compared with only 30% in \n1990. The ongoing process of global production sharing\u2014in which developing Asian economies \nare increasingly integrated into intraregional production networks (supply chains)\u2014underlies \nrapid growth in manufactured products such as machinery and transport equipment.  \n9.  The  trade  proportion  of  parts  and  components  in  developing  Asia  has  increased \ncontinuously  since  the  early  1990s.2  In  terms  of  exports,  it  increased  from  16%  of  total \nmanufacturing exports in 1992 to 25% in 2006. In contrast, exports of parts and components \nfrom India are limited. The share of India\u2019s parts and components in total manufacturing exports \nwas only 7% in 2006, from 3% in 1992. \nB.  India\u2019s Trade \n  1.  Economic Reforms \n10.  For much of the first 4 decades since its independence, India followed an autarchic \ndevelopment model encouraging import substitution and protection of domestic products and \nservices, and keeping a tightly controlled capital account. After a balance-of-payments crisis in \n1991, the Government recognized the need for reform and the fact that high protection was \nassociated with low rates of economic growth and low income of its citizens.  \n11.  First  generation  of  reforms.  These  were  initiated  in  the  early  1990s  and  were \ncharacterized  by  the  facilitation  of  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI);  a  policy  fostering  the \nprivatization of nonstrategic state-owned enterprises; and the development of capital market \ninfrastructure for the corporate bond and equity markets, pension reforms, increased licensing \nof  private  banks,  improved  prudential  regulation  and  supervision  of  banking  through  the \nReserve Bank of India (RBI), and improved supervision of capital markets through the Securities \nand Exchange Board of India. Concurrent with the structural reforms, India moved from an \nexclusively  government-managed  and  highly  regulated  financial  sector  to  a  more \nmarket-oriented regime by introducing indirect instruments of monetary policy, and admitting \nprivate banks to stimulate competition. Important milestones include \n(i)  massive reduction of statutory liquidity from 37% in 1991 to 25% in 1997 and \ncash reserve requirements from 15% to 5% in 2005; \n(ii)  effective deregulation of interest rates by 1997, except for the smallest loans; \n(iii)  entry of private and foreign banks, with the 19 new private and 31 foreign banks \nand the private sector holding a 26% share of banking assets; \n(iv)  establishment of a securities market regulator in 1992 and the national stock \nexchange in 1994 (now the leading stock exchange in the country); \n(v)  introduction of infrastructure and secondary markets for corporate bonds and \ndevelopment of a maturity yield curve through the issue of government bonds; \n(vi)  development of market intermediaries such as private mutual funds (1993) and \nprivate insurance companies (2000); and \n                                                 \n2  Jongwanich, J., W, James, P.

Alignment  of  domestic  and  international  standards.  Subsequent  to  the  Asian \nfinancial crisis, the Government established a standing committee on international financial \nstandards and codes in December 1999 to benchmark its practice following recommendations \nmade by the financial stability forum on (i) accounting and auditing, (ii) banking supervision, \n(iii) bankruptcy,  (iv)  corporate  governance,  (v)  data  dissemination,  (vi)  fiscal  transparency, \n(vii) insurance regulation, (viii) transparency of monetary and financial policies, (ix) payments \nand settlements system, and (x) securities market regulation.  \n13.  Money laundering and financing of terrorism. Implementing a 1998 United Nations \nresolution, Parliament promulgated the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in July 2002. RBI \nconstituted the Committee on Bank Frauds in 1999, putting in place procedures, systems, and \ncontrols to help combat money laundering. RBI issued a circular to banks prescribing \u201cknow \nyour customer\u201d guidelines and directing them to monitor suspicious cash transactions. The \ndirectives  require  banks  to  adopt  appropriate  policies  and  procedures  for  (i)  customer \nidentification, (ii) monitoring of suspicious transactions, and (iii) screening and reporting of \ntransactions of terrorist entities or of entities suspected of fronting for terrorist activities.  \n14.  Improved legal framework for banking. Legal reforms include the passage of security \nlaws and the Negotiable Instruments Act. RBI has proposed comprehensive amendments to the \nRBI Act of 1934 and the Banking Regulation Act of 1949. The Securitization and Reconstruction \nof Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (2002) regulates the securitization \nand restructuring of financial assets and the enforcement of debt security, improving creditor \nrights. The nonperforming loans of commercial banks have decreased substantially. \nFigure A2.1: Financial System Depth in Asia \n(% to GDP)\n400%\n350%\n300%\n250%\n200%\n150%\n100%\n50%\n0%\nIndia (95) India (00) India (04) Indonesia (04) Philippines Thailand (04) PRC (04) Republic of Malaysia (04)\n(04) Korea(04)\nBank deposits Corporate debt Government debt Equity\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People's Republic of China.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \n15.  Notwithstanding this progress, India\u2019s financial sector is still behind the Asian emerging \nmarkets and has only recently improved its depth in the economy. Total financial system assets \nare still low; despite a high savings rate, most assets are channeled into government debt \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nthrough the government-dominated banking system or into low-quality priority sector loans. \nCurrently, only about 40% of credit is available to the private sector, while the bulk goes to \npriority  sectors  and  state-owned  entities.  Most  importantly,  the  corporate  bond  market  is \nunderdeveloped, constituting only 2% of GDP in FY2004; a more significant proportion is being \nissued by government paper or through private placements.  \n2.  Trade Growth  \n16.  High-growth trajectory. As a result of the structural reforms initiated in the early 1990s, \na favorable world economy, and increasing globalization of businesses, India has benefited \nsignificantly from high economic growth, averaging 7.8% since FY2002 (Table A2.6). This is \nsubstantially  above  the  average  annual  4%  achieved  over  the  preceding  5  decades. \nParticipating  in  the  increasing  globalization  of  the  world  economy  and  concurrent  with \nimpressive domestic growth, foreign merchandise trade volume grew substantially at an annual \naverage of 22% for exports, tripling over the 5-year period since FY2002, and 28% for imports, \na more-than-fourfold increase. India\u2019s exports of services, especially for information technology, \nbiotechnology, call centers, and other administrative outsourcing services, are an engine of \ngrowth,  expanding  by  an  annual  average  of  34%,  while  imports  of  services  from  abroad \nexpanded by an annual average of 22%. The ratio of merchandise exports to GDP increased \nfrom 5.8% in FY1991 to 13.9% in FY2007, while the ratio of imports to GDP increased from \n8.8% to 21.1%. The global slowdown has brought this trend to a temporary halt. \nTable A2.6: India\u2019s Foreign Trade, 1991\u20132008 \n(% of GDP) \n \nItem  FY1991  FY2001  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006   FY2007  FY2008 \nTrade: Exports  5.8  9.9  10.6  11.0  12.2  13.1  13.9  15.4 \n     Imports  8.8  12.6  12.7  13.3  17.1  19.5  21.1  23.7 \nInvisibles: Receipts  2.4  7.0  8.2  8.9  10.0  11.5  13.0  13.8 \n             Payments  2.4  4.9  4.9  4.3  5.5  6.2  7.0  6.9 \nCurrent Account: Receipts  8.0  16.9  18.7  19.8  22.1  24.4  26.9  29.1 \n                         Payments  11.2  17.5  17.6  17.6  22.6  25.7  28.0  30.7 \nCapital Account: Foreign investment  \u2014  1.5  1.2  2.6  2.2  2.5  2.9  3.4 \n                       Capital inflows  7.2  11.8  9.1  12.6  14.1  17.6  24.8  40.1 \n                       Capital outflows  5.0  9.8  7.0  9.8  10.1  14.7  19.9  30.1 \nImport Cover of Reserves (months)  2.5  8.9  14.2  16.9  14.3  11.6  12.4  13.9 \n \u2014 = no data available, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \n Source: Ministry of Finance, Government of India. 2008.

Although the United States remains \nIndia\u2019s largest trade partner, its importance is declining, while that of Asian, and even African \ncountries, is picking up. Since FY2001, the United States\u2019 share of India\u2019s trade declined from \n13% to 9.7%, while the PRC\u2019s increased from 2.5% to 7.7%, and that of the United Arab \nEmirates increased from 3.4% to 6.9%. While trade with the United States and Europe will \nremain significant, it will grow at a slower pace compared with trade with the new markets. India \nrecently  identified  opportunities  for  trade  with  South  Asia,  Southeast  Asia,  and  Africa. \nFigure A2.2  illustrates  India\u2019s  recent  impressive  trade  growth,  especially  in  Asia.

Balance of payments, trade deficit, and net capital inflows. India\u2019s foreign trade \ncontinued with its strong momentum in FY2007, with exports growing annually by 26% and \nimports by 18%. The trade deficit rose to $65 billion from $52 billion. India\u2019s foreign trade grew \nmoderately in FY2007 for exports of primary products, while manufactured products declined, \nas a result of a decline in exports of gems and jewelry, textiles, chemicals, ores, and minerals, \nwhile exports of agricultural products (tea, spices, sugar, and molasses), engineering goods, \nand petroleum products maintained their growth momentum. Engineering goods and petroleum \nproducts contributed 62% to the total export growth in FY2007. India\u2019s merchandise imports \ndropped to 28% during the same period, compared with a 34% growth in FY2006. Oil imports \ngrew by 30% in FY2007 (versus 47% in FY2006), largely reflecting surging oil prices, and \nimports of ores and metal scrap (126%), machinery (42%), gold and silver (32%), and electronic \ngoods (25%) grew significantly, reflecting the construction boom associated with India\u2019s growth \nas well as increases in the prices of primary products. The significant export growth attests to \nIndia\u2019s growing competitiveness and favorable world demand, while the growth in imports may \nbe largely attributed to the buoyant Indian manufacturing sector and increasing demand and \nprices.  \n19.  Services, transfers, and income transfers remained buoyant in FY2007, led by robust \nexport growth of software and other services and supported private remittances. In FY2007, \nIndia\u2019s net inflow of invisibles amounted to $55.3 billion ($42.7 billion in FY2006). Service \nexports increased by nearly 60% yearly on average from FY2001 and stood at $81.3 billion in \nFY2007,  supported  by  software  and  business  services.  The  favorable  investment  climate, \nespecially the surge in outsourcing of information technology, software, and business services, \nled to an increase in the proportion of service current account inflows from 23% to 30% over \nonly 3 years. The robust growth of the trade in invisibles kept the current account deficit to $9.6 \nbillion in FY2007.  \n20.  Surge of capital inflows and outflows. On the capital account, FDI in India tripled to \n$19 billion, and Indian investments abroad almost quintupled to $11 billion in FY2006 and \nFY2007, leading to a net FDI of $8.4 billion in FY2007. External commercial borrowings tripled \nto $16 billion during the same period, and the recent dramatic surge in FY2007 led to increasing \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nRBI  concerns  about  inflationary  pressures  associated  with  external  commercial  borrowings \nchanneled into the Indian economy, and its call for corrective action in April 2007 (Table A2.9). \nTable A2.7: India\u2014Growth and Composition of Service Exports  \n(%) \nItem  FY1991 FY2001 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006  FY2007 FY2008 \nSoftware and others  \u2014  39.0  47.6  40.9  38.4  38.5  67.0 \nTravel  32.0  21.5  18.7  15.4  12.8  11.6  11.4 \nTransportation  21.6  12.6  11.9  10.8  10.2  9.9  10.0 \nInsurance  2.4  1.7  1.6  2.0  1.7  1.5  1.6 \nTotal  ($ billion)  4.6  16.3  26.8  43.2  61.4  81.3  90.0 \nAverage annual growth FY1991\u20132001\u20132007    25.0        57.0   \n\u2014 = no data available, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India. 2008.

While  the  recent  performance  is  very  impressive  compared  with  India\u2019s  past \nperformance, India has recognized that it trails East Asia in trade performance. The PRC\u2019s \nimports of goods expanded by 50% annually and exports by 53%, while export of services grew \n29% yearly and imports of services by 23%. In 2006, India\u2019s share of world exports was 1.8%, \nwhile the PRC\u2019s stood at 7.9%. The PRC\u2019s and India\u2019s similar size and status as developing \ncountries  point  to  enormous  opportunities  for  India\u2019s  foreign  trade  as  it  improves  its \ncompetitiveness.  \n22.  Trade and per capita income. In the 1990s, the PRC\u2019s per capita income doubled; \nIndia\u2019s increased by only 10% (Table A2.10). Both countries have benefited largely from a \nbuoyant world economy since 2000, boosting per capita income by 155% in the PRC and by \n120% in India over only 7 years. The countries\u2019 openness and the increase in the incomes of its \ncitizens are strongly associated, pointing to the large potential of trade leading to trickle-down \neffects to small business, employment, and income through linkages with the manufacturing \nvalue chain. Since FY2000, the dollar value of India\u2019s labor-intensive exports of agricultural \nproduce have surged at an annual 14% and manufactured goods at 24%, indicating initial \nintegration of rural areas and farmers, as well as small and medium enterprises (SMEs), into the \nglobal value chain. Experienced corporate exporters, however, have not yet established large \nsupply networks with small businesses and farmers in rural India. Thus, trade has so far not \nbeen fully effective in poverty reduction in rural areas, and especially in the backward and \npoorer regions of India. This is consistent with the findings of the Trade and Development \nReport  2007  (footnote 1),  and  of  the  G8,3  G24,4  and  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) \nunderpinning the rationale for the Aid for Trade initiative.5  \nTable A2.10: Gross National Income Per Capita in Current Prices \n($) \nCountry  1990  1995  2000  2006  2007  2008 \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  320  520  890  2,010  2,320  3,000 \nIndia  390  330a  450  820  990  1,043 \na  1994 figure.  \nSources: International Monetary Fund, World Bank.  \n23.  South Asia: Inequality and poor infrastructure undermining trade. The trade of the \nSouth Asian economies still falls significantly below that of Southeast and East Asia, as well as \nthe global average. The subregion is characterized by poor connectivity, and limited market \naccess. Limited subregional trade is a result of large nontariff barriers and high protection. \nExcept for Nepal, all trade partners within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \n(SAARC) have insignificant trade activity. \n24.  South  Asia:  Growing  importance  in  the  international  value  chain.  The  trade \ncentrality index illustrates an economy\u2019s positioning in global value chains and trade networks. A \nhigh trade centrality value (on a scale of 0\u2013100) reflects a central position of influence within key \n                                                 \n3  The Group of 8 (G8) is an international forum for the governments of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the \nRussian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n4  The Group of 24 (G24), a chapter of the Group of 77 (G77), was established in 1971 to coordinate the positions of \ndeveloping countries on international monetary and development finance issues.

Except for India, with an index of 20, South Asia is still relatively \nmarginally integrated into the global value chain compared with the United States (index of 90), \nEurope (index of 80), Japan (index of 60), and Thailand (index of 25).6  \n4.  Trade Strategy and Policy Reforms  \n    a.  Trade Policy \n25.  Trade and income growth stimulus. India recognized the opportunities and challenges \nassociated with the increasing globalization of the world economy in the articulation of its \nForeign Trade Policy 2004\u20132009, which aims to double India\u2019s share in world trade to 2% and \ngenerate additional employment through the promotion of labor-intensive exports. India aims to \nstimulate growth in trade, exploit its labor advantage, and broaden the benefits from trade \ngrowth with greater inclusiveness of growth. India\u2019s trade strategy aims to \n(i)  rationalize tariffs and tax rebates, and reduce transaction costs; \n(ii)  improve the quality and reliability of exports; \n(iii)  improve export infrastructure; and \n(iv)  expand SME trade finance over the long term. \nb.  World Trade Organization \n26.  India, an active member of the WTO, provides \u201cmost favored nation\u201d (MFN) status to \nother members. It stresses the need to address agricultural subsidies in rich countries and tariff \nand nontariff barriers to exports of developing countries. India has accepted the fourth and fifth \nprotocols and is a member of the Information Technology Agreement.7 It is not a party to the \nWTO Government Procurement Agreement. Like all other WTO members, India is required to \nmake regular notifications of its trade-related laws and measures. It believes that the interests of \nthe  650  million  poor  who  are  dependent  on  agriculture  should  not  be  jeopardized,  and \nemphasizes special and differential treatment through lower tariff reduction commitments by \ndeveloping countries and a list of special products vital to ensuring the livelihoods of poor \nfarmers. For services, India seeks increased market access, especially through the liberalization \nof professional services.  \n27.  In the current trade negotiations, India has submitted proposals relating to agriculture, \nnonagricultural market access, services, disputes, competition policy, trade facilitation, rules, \ntrade-related intellectual property rights, and special and differential treatment. A number of \nthese proposals were made jointly with other members and developing countries, including the \nG20, G33, and nonagricultural market access-11 groups. At the September 2003 conference in \nCancun, Mexico, and the December 2005 conference in Hong Kong, China, the Government of \nIndia stressed the need to address agricultural subsidies in rich countries, and tariff and nontariff \nbarriers maintained by these countries on products of export interest to developing countries.8 It \nis emphasizing special and differential treatment through proportionately lower overall bound \ntariff  reduction  commitments  by  developing  countries,  coupled  with  a  special  safeguard \nmechanism and a list of special products vital to ensuring the livelihoods and food security of \nfarmers in developing countries.  \n                                                 \n6  Kali, R., and J.

Regional trade agreements, besides the WTO, are supplemental building blocks. Since \n1975, India has signed a number of agreements, mainly with developing countries to strengthen \nties with regional groups, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the South Asian \nAssociation  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC),  and  the  Bay  of  Bengal  Initiative  for \nMulti-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). Current negotiations include \nstrengthening regional ties, for example, through the SAARC and BIMSTEC, but India is also \nseeking  to  develop  ties  with  other  regional  groupings,  such  as  ASEAN  and  MERCOSUR \n(regional trade agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). Recent trade \nagreements, including an agreement with Singapore, go beyond negotiations on goods, to \ninclude services and investment. \n29.  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation.  SAARC,  an  agreement  for \nregional  cooperation  among  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  Maldives,  Nepal,  Pakistan,  and \nSri Lanka,  was  established  in  December  1985.  In  1993,  the  SAARC  preferential  trading \narrangement was signed, providing limited preferential market access. The agreement on a \nSouth Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) was signed during the 12th SAARC Summit in Islamabad \nin January 2004. The preferences exchanged under SAFTA will continue to be available to \nmembers until the tariff liberalization is complete, as targeted for 2008 for nonmembers of the \ngroup  of  least  developed  countries  (LDCs)  and  for  2012  for  LDC  members  (Bangladesh, \nBhutan, Maldives, and Nepal). India has notified 744 import items from LDC members and 865 \nfrom non-LDC members; the first tariff reductions took effect on 1 July 2006.  \nTable A2.11: Commitments under Regional Trade Agreements, 2007 \nTrade in \nAgreement  Trade in Goods  Services  Other Areas \nSAFTA  Non-LDC members, including India to reduce tariffs to 20%  Not  Not \nwithin 2 years, followed by a reduction to 0%\u20135% in 5 years   applicable  applicable \n(6 years for Sri Lanka) and 3 years for imports from LDC \nmembers.

Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation. \nBangladesh,  India,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Thailand  signed  the  agreement  in  June  1997;  Bhutan, \nMyanmar, and Nepal joined in 2004. In February 2004, the members signed a framework \nagreement to form a free trade area by 2012. Although this agreement provides for negotiations \nto be concluded on goods by December 2005, and on services and investment by 2007, these \ndeadlines have not been met because of complex issues. \n32.  Sri Lanka. India signed a free trade agreement with Sri Lanka in December 1998. Under \nthe agreement, India eliminated tariffs, except for a negative list comprising 429 items including \ngarments, plastics and rubber, alcoholic spirits, and coconut oil.11 India maintains tariff quotas \non tea and garments under the agreement, which provides for antidumping and safeguard \nmeasures, and the suspension of preferences in case of balance-of-payments difficulties. India \nand Sri Lanka are currently negotiating a comprehensive agreement to include services trade. \n33.  Comprehensive  Economic  Cooperation  Agreement  with  Singapore.

Commitments were made to protect investment, including protection \nfrom expropriation and compensation for expropriation. The agreement exempts Singapore \ninvestment from capital gains tax. \n34.  Framework Agreement for Establishing a Free Trade Area. The agreement, signed \nwith Thailand in October 2003, covers trade in goods, services, and investment, and specific \ncommitments related to the trade of goods, including the elimination of tariffs on 82 products. \n35.  Framework  Agreement  on  Comprehensive  Economic  Co-operation.  The  first \nASEAN\u2013India Summit was held on 5 November 2002 in Cambodia, where India committed to \nspecial and differential treatment of ASEAN members based on their development, and to align \nits peak tariffs to East Asian levels by 2005. The framework agreement was signed with ASEAN \non 8 October 2003 and includes trade in goods, services, and investments and an \u201cearly \nharvest\u201d program. An India\u2013ASEAN free trade agreement was concluded in August 2008. \n36.  European  Union  Partnership  Agreement.  The  India\u2013European  Union  Strategic \nPartnership was signed on 7 September 2005; a senior trade group was established to identify \nreforms in trade relations and to negotiate a broad-based trade and investment agreement. \n37.  South African Customs Union, Common Market of the South, and others. India is \nexploring the possibility of a comprehensive agreement with the Southern African Customs \nUnion (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland), and has signed preferential \nagreements with Afghanistan (6 March 2003), the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) \n(19 March 2005), and Chile (8 March 2006). A framework agreement for cooperation in trade in \ngoods and services and investment was signed with MERCOSUR on 25 January 2004. As a \nfirst step, India committed on 450 tariff lines ranging from 10% to 100% of the MFN rate. The \nframework agreement signed with Chile on 20 January 2005 includes 178 tariff lines ranging \nfrom 10% to 50% of the MFN rate. The agreements with MERCOSUR and Chile are not yet in \nforce.  \n38.  The bilateral agreement with Nepal was extended up to 5 March 2007, and the free \ntrade agreement with Bhutan, conducted in local currency, was extended on 29 July 2006 for \n10 years. The trade cooperation agreement with Bangladesh was extended for 3 years, from \n1 April 2006. India also maintains transit agreements with Bangladesh and Nepal. India is \nnegotiating a number of trade agreements with the Republic of Korea, Mauritius, and the Gulf \nCooperation  Council,  and  has  set  up  joint  study  groups  to  explore  the  feasibility  of \ncomprehensive economic cooperation agreements with Australia, the PRC, Indonesia, Japan, \nMalaysia, the Russian Federation, and the United States.  \nd.  Tariff and Tax Regime \n39.  India aims to neutralize the incidence of levies and duties on inputs used in export \nproducts, liberalize controls, and simplify export procedures. Although it reduced peak import \ntariff rates for manufactured goods from more than 200% in 1990 to 10% in 2007, import tariff \nremains  its  main  trade  policy  instrument  as  well  as  an  important  source  of  tax  revenue, \nconstituting 16% of central government tax revenue.  \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n40.  Applied  MFN  tariffs,  especially  for  nonagricultural  products,  have  continued  to  fall \nsteadily,  with  the  overall  average  currently  at  16%.  At  12%  (14%  including  ad  valorem \nequivalents), the average for nonagricultural products is considerably lower than the average for \nagricultural products, which is 41%. With the exception of a few applied tariffs, which are at their \ncorresponding  bound  rates,  the  difference  between  the  bound  and  applied  tariff  rates  is \nconsiderable, giving the Government substantial discretion to raise applied tariffs. This was \nused to raise tariffs for some agricultural products in recent years. The overall trend in tariff \nrates is downward and, in its FY2008 budget, the Government announced a reduction of the \npeak  rate  from  12.5%  to  10%.  Despite  gradual  reform  over  the  years,  the  tariff  remains \ncomplex; tariff changes are announced throughout the year and with numerous exemptions, a \nnumber of which are based on industrial use. \n41.  India offers tariff preferences under regional trade agreements. However, apart from the \nagreement with Sri Lanka and some members of the SAFTA, the preferences do not appear to \nbe significant. The use of import restrictions has declined, with around 3.5% of tariff lines \nsubject to such measures. Another 300 sensitive imports are monitored, while the policy for \nstate trading remains essentially unchanged. \ne.  Transaction Costs  \n42.  Industrial policy reforms have concentrated on simplifying and reducing restrictions. The \nnumber  of  sectors  requiring  compulsory  industrial  licensing  for  safety,  environmental,  and \nstrategic reasons has been reduced from six to five, while the number of items reserved for \nproduction by small-scale industries has declined substantially, from 799 in 2001 to 326 in \nMay 2006. However, as a result of cumbersome documentation, especially for imported goods, \nIndia is behind its competitors. \n43.  Efforts to increase competition have been aided by the introduction of new legislation to \nencourage competition and to ease the closure of unviable companies. The new laws include \nthe Competition Law, and the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Act, passed in 2006 to \nencourage  the  development  of  these  businesses.  Progress  has  been  made  in  improving \ncorporate governance, notably through improved listing requirements for listed companies and \nbanks; in addition, efforts are under way to amend the Companies Act of 1956, to increase \ntransparency and accountability. \n44.  Product standards and procedures. India undertook a considerable effort to align \nnational product standards with international norms; now 73% of national standards are aligned. \nSanitary and phytosanitary procedures were streamlined with the passage of the Food Safety \nand Standards Act of 2006 consolidating 13 laws. \n45.  Figures A2.3 and A2.4 illustrate the high cost of doing business for exports and, even \nworse, for imports at Indian ports. The import process is cumbersome as a result of the large \nnumber  of  protected  items,  which  puts  Indian  firms  at  a  disadvantage  in  relation  to  its \ninternational competitors. \n ", "Appendix 2  35\nFigure A2.3: Competitiveness of Trade compared with OECD average\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n-\n(10)\nArgentina Bangladesh Brazil Chile PRC Egypt Kong, China India Indonesia Malaysia Mexico Nepal Pakistan Peru Philippines Singapore South Africa Taipei,China Thailand Viet Nam\ng \nn\no\nH\nExport days above OECD average Import days above OECD average\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, PRC = People's Republic of China.\nSource: World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2007.

To enhance competitiveness with neighbors, improved trade \nflow among South Asian countries is important at land border crossings. Trade continues to \nsuffer  from  cumbersome  regulations,  security  clearance,  and  certification.  The  cost  of \ncross-border trade in South Asia is still extremely high as a result of delays, corruption, and the \nabsence of harmonized and streamlined customs procedures. \n    f.  Trade Infrastructure and Logistics \n47.  The development of transport corridors and associated trade logistics is critical for timely \nand cost-effective turnover of goods. The corridors of Delhi\u2013Mumbai, Delhi\u2013Gujarat, Bangalore\u2013\nChennai, Kathmandu\u2013Birgunj\u2013Kolkata\u2013Haldia, and Thimpu\u2013Kolkata are being developed. The \ncoordinated performance of the route and logistics services is critical. The selection of routes \ndepends on the characteristics of goods shipped, as well as the sensitivity of market demand to \ntime and cost. For example, high-value cargoes are usually more time than cost sensitive. \n48.  Private operation of transport and logistics services has provided significant gains in \nefficiency. The public sector continues to be an important provider of rail and air transport as \nwell as transport infrastructure. High-volume corridors, such as Delhi\u2013Mumbai, allow for faster \nturnaround,  better  freight  planning,  and  better  load  factors.  Concor,  a  public\u2013private  joint \nventure (37% owned by the private sector, 63% by Indian Railways) has been successful in \nproviding container train services on key corridors, notably Delhi\u2013Mumbai. The logistics industry \nin India has increased its capacity to track and trace services, which are currently limited to \nfrequented corridors linking the major economic centers of India, while low-volume corridors \ncannot effectively handle containers and seamless transfer and reconsolidation facilities.  \n49.  With the strong growth in trade, India has experienced dramatic growth in international \ncontainer traffic, pushing port capacities to the limit. Trade gateways for India and neighboring \nSAARC countries include seaports, airports, and land border crossings. These gateways suffer \nfrom a significant regulatory burden associated with customs and security. Certification and the \ncost of cross-border trade in South Asia and SAARC rank highest in the world.  \n50.  Improved infrastructure and logistics services of roads, ports, and airports are essential \nto integrate India\u2019s exporters into the global value chain and improve competitiveness. Private \ninvestors and service providers are encouraged to participate in financing, construction, and \nmaintenance of infrastructure. Private operation of transport and logistics services has resulted \nin significant efficiency gains. While the public sector remains an important provider of rail and \nair  services  and  transport  infrastructure,  reforms  to  increase  the  turnaround  of  goods  are \ngradually being introduced. India\u2019s container-handling costs at its ports compare unfavorably \nwith key competitors. Also, Indian export goods normally require double the handling time at the \nport. The Government estimates investments in transport infrastructure alone at $150 billion \nover the next 5 years.  \ng.  Overall Performance and Export Contribution of the Small and \nMedium Enterprise Sector   \n51.  Encouraging the development of SMEs is a strategy particularly well suited to India\u2019s \ndevelopment challenges. SMEs are typically less capital intensive and more labor intensive and \n ", "Appendix 2  37\ntherefore best suited to countries like India, the PRC, and most other developing countries with \nan abundant supply of low-cost manpower and bountiful natural resources.12 \n52.  According  to  a  survey  conducted  by  the  Ministry  of  Micro,  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprises, the number of small-scale industry (SSI) units in India has increased, from 10.95 \nmillion in 2002\u20132003 to 12.8 million (registered and unregistered) in 2006\u20132007.13 Around 81% \nof these units are proprietorships and the remaining 17% are partnerships and private limited \ncompanies. Investment in fixed asset grew by 5% from Rs1,625 billion ($39.67 billion) in 2002\u2013\n2003 to Rs2,073 billion ($50 billion) in 2006\u20132007. About 8,000 products were manufactured, \nwith values increasing from Rs3,120 billion ($76.55 billion) in 2002\u20132003 to Rs8,160 billion \n($200 billion) in 2006\u20132007.

At present, the SME sector contributes nearly half of India\u2019s total exports, out of which, \nnearly 35% comprises direct exports while the remaining 15% takes the form of indirect exports \nthrough merchant exporters, trading houses and export houses, wholesalers, and lead firms \nalong incipient value chains. Active export sectors like clothing, gems, jewelry, leather, and \nmarine products are dominated by SME units. In export orders from large units, SME units also \nsupport  large  manufacturers  or  supply  parts,  components,  and  subassemblies  for  use  in \nfinished goods for exports. The volume of SSI exports increased 14 times from $2.37 billion in \n1990\u20131991 to $33.9 billion in 2005\u20132006 (Table A2.12). \n \n \n                                                 \n12 The PRC\u2019s 42 million SMEs account for 99% of all enterprises and provide 75% of jobs in the urban areas. Thus, \nthe PRC Government is implementing a special law to promote and protect these units.  \n 13 According to estimates (RBI 2005), the SME sector consists of 12.3 million enterprises employing 29.5 million \npeople. \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \nC.  Short-Term and Long-Term Trade Finance  \n1.  Context of Globalization  \n54.  Trade  finance.  While  improving  the  trade  environment  is  a  challenging  task,  the \nGovernment has appropriately identified areas for trade reform and is gradually addressing \nthem. More importantly, it has identified the growth potential of emerging markets, especially in \nAsia, and is making active use of the demand stimulated in these regions. Trade finance \ninstruments are essential for the effective growth of trade.  \n55.  Convergence of financial sector standards. India is undertaking substantial efforts to \nharmonize its standards with internationally acceptable norms, to combat money laundering and \nterrorist financing, and to introduce Basel II.  \n56.  Underdeveloped  markets  for  export  finance  segments. The experience of many \ndeveloped and developing countries suggests that commercial banks are capable of providing \nshort-term  trade  finance  (especially  post-shipment  finance)  for  manufactured  goods  and \nservices, given the short-term financing need, which normally does not exceed 180 days from \nthe shipment of the good. Pre-shipment finance is riskier because the production of goods may \nrequire longer production and prefinancing periods. The financing of exports and imports of \ncapital goods is normally challenging for commercial banks since the long gestation period \nrequires financing of tenors that do not easily match their funding structure. Export markets, \nespecially emerging markets, are associated with high credit risk because of uncertainty and \ninformation  asymmetry  over  legislation,  political  stability,  and  business  practices  in  the \ndestination countries.  \n2.  Role of the Export-Import Bank of India and Commercial Banks \n57.  Trade financing in India is governed by the Foreign Exchange Management Act and \ndirectives issued by RBI. Typical export credits, i.e., pre-shipment and post-shipment credits, \nare the customary banking credit facilities used by exporters in India. Exports of commodities \nand manufactured products, where foreign exchange is realized or payments made typically \nwithin 180 days from shipment date, require short-term finance, while exports of capital goods, \nservices, and turnkey projects require medium-term (1\u20135 years) and medium- to long-term \n(beyond 5 years) loans. Commercial banks, with their short-term liability structure, concentrate \non  traditional  short-term  trade  finance.  Exim  Bank  offers  export  refinancing  to  commercial \nbanks. Exim Bank is expanding its role in export finance (Table A2.13). \nTable A2.13: Exim Bank Investment in Aid for Trade  \nto Address Market and Governance Failures \n \nRole for \nBroad Source or Area  Examples of  Policy and Activity  Role for Aid for  Multilateral \nof Failure  Failures  Responses   Trade  Finance \nMarket failures         \nCoordination  Externalities  Capacity building for  Yes, training and  TA finance \nignored  SME to identify  institutional  (grant, loan) \nproduction chain  development, \nLinkages not \nlinkages and  market \nexploited  \nexternalities  development \nComplementarities  programs \nnot exploited \n \n ", "Appendix 2  39\nRole for \nBroad Source or Area  Examples of  Policy and Activity  Role for Aid for  Multilateral \nof Failure  Failures  Responses   Trade  Finance \nDeveloping, adapting and  Incomplete and  Facilitate technology  Yes, trade  Long-term finance \nadopting technology,  imperfect  transfer and adoption.  facilitation  (NSO) \nstandards, financial  information  investment with the \nSupport for quality \nextension, BDS  private sector \nNetwork  control to meet export \nexternalities  standards \nAccess to finance  Difficult access to  Credit schemes  Normally not  Short term  \nprovided by commercial  credit  included under Aid  (TFFP)a \nbanks as a means of  for Trade    \nHigh interest rates \npayment between \nimporters and exporters \nfor pre-shipment, post-\nshipment is restricted \n \nTrade facilitation  Lack of good  Provide incentives for  Yes, aid to  Long-term finance \ninfrastructure   quality trade  public\u2013private  economic  (NSO and/or \n(logistics,  facilitation  partnerships  infrastructure and  sovereign) \ncommunications,  infrastructure  better coordination \nProvide loans in the \neconomic hubs and  because lumpy  with government \ncase of low financial \nzones, corridor  investment gets  and private sector \nreturn and high \ninfrastructure, boarder  postponed in \neconomic return \ninfrastructure, overseas  uncertain times \nmarket access depots \nand infrastructure, etc.) \n \nGovernance failure         \nRegulatory and  Burdensome  Streamline  Yes, trade policy  Medium-term \nadministrative structure  administrative  administrative  and regulations  adjustment finance \nrequirements.  procedures and  (especially trade  (sovereign) \nregulation  facilitation). \n \nBDS = business development services, NSO = nonsovereign operation, SME = small and medium enterprise, TA = \ntechnical assistance, TFFP = trade finance facilitation program.  \na   Jongwanich, J., W.

Because  of  the \nprevalence of high risk in export finance, most successful exporting countries have established \nspecialized public sector financial institutions to ensure that trade and export finance is provided \nwhere  the  market  is  unable  or  unwilling  to  provide  that  service.  The  financial  institutions \nnormally take the form of export credit guarantee agencies and specialized banks that focus on \nmitigating  the  commercial  risk  for  funding  exports  to  emerging  markets  and  longer-tenor \nstructures. Contrary to conventional perception, privately owned structures have proved less \nsuccessful at spearheading export finance into new markets. Export finance in new emerging \nmarkets is normally facilitated by bilateral or multilateral government-to-government agreements \nthat provide legal protection and implicit political risk guarantee to exporters. \n59.  Trade finance is provided by commercial banks and Exim Bank to exporters in national \nand foreign currency. Scheduled commercial banks are required to lend 12% of their business \nfor exports. In March 2006, 19% of foreign banks loans outstanding constituted export credit. \n60.  Exim Bank to develop export markets and leverage export finance.

Banking Reform in the Context of Globalization  \n61.  Coordinated approach to bank risk management (Basel II). The globalization of the \nworld economy is posing increasing demands to upgrade capability and risk management \nsystems to facilitate cross-border finance and bring these in line with international standards. \nThe Government recently established a blueprint for an international financial center in Mumbai \nto accommodate India\u2019s integration into the financial markets. It has also taken the following \nsteps to introduce the new Basel II risk management framework for banks in India. As a \nparticipant of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, RBI has recognized the need (i) to \nreform  the  capital  adequacy  framework  to  take  into  account  the  globalization  of  financial \nservices,  and  (ii)  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  good  board  and  prudential  supervision \nincluding  management  understanding  of  the  banks\u2019  inherent  risks  when  defining  minimum \ncapital. \n62.  On 27 April 2007, RBI prescribed, in line with the International Convergence of Capital \nMeasurement and Capital Standards (a revised framework),16 the so-called Basel II framework, \nits Guidelines for the New Capital Adequacy Framework.17 RBI is taking a gradual approach \nthat requires all commercial banks in India (excluding local area banks and regional rural banks) \nto adopt the standardized approach to managing credit risk and the basic indicator approach to \noperating risk by 21 March 2009, and to continue to apply the standardized duration approach \nwhen computing capital requirements for market risks. Foreign banks operating in India and \nIndian  banks  with  operations  outside  India  had  to  comply  with  the  new  framework  by \n31 March 2008.18  \n63.  To  facilitate  the  transition  to  the  new  framework,  since  2006  all  banks  have  been \nrequired to prepare parallel statements under the current and new frameworks to encourage the \n                                                 \n14 10% in FY2000. \n15 Reserve Bank of India statistics on external commercial borrowing. 2007. \n16 See framework issued on 30 June 2006 at www.bis.org.  \n17 See RBI/2006-2007/357 DBOD.

Pillar 2 of the Basel II \nframework requires banks\u2019 boards to undertake compliance assessments; establish policies for \ncredit risk mitigation, disclosure, and internal capital adequacy assessment; and assess the \nbanks\u2019  management  information  systems  for  compliance  with  the  standard  under  the  new \nframework.  \n64.  RBI will consider relevant risk factors and the internal capital adequacy assessments in \nsetting an adequate bank capital requirement that is commensurate with its risk profile. This \nincludes the capability of risk management to identify, assess, measure, and manage interest \nrate risk, liquidity risk, concentration risk, residual risk, and other banking risks.  \n65.  Basel II to facilitate flow of resources for trade finance. While Exim Bank is not \nrequired  to  comply  with  the  RBI  regulations,  it  has  done  so  voluntarily  over  the  years  to \nunderscore  a  professional  standard  at  par  with  the  rest  of  the  banking  subsector.  It  has \nconsistently taken steps to improve its risk management according to the Basel II framework. \nHowever,  considering  the  anticipated  trend  in  trade  funding  needs  in  more-challenging \nemerging markets, a more fundamental review of Exim Bank\u2019s business model is needed to \nalign  it  effectively  with  changing  market  needs  and  requirements  for  more-effective  risk \nmanagement. Technical assistance will assist Exim Bank in this process.  \n \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK \nA.  Guiding Principles \n1.  The globalization of the world economy is posing increasing demands to upgrade the \ncapability and risk management systems to facilitate cross-border finance and bring these in line \nwith international standards. It is expected that India\u2019s exporters will face rising quality standards \nfor exports of their goods, especially to industrialized and newly industrializing economies. \nAmong the standards to be met in the manufacturing and value-addition process are core labor \nstandards, as well as environmental and social safeguards that increase the need to meet the \nstandards and legislation of the importing countries. The recent discussion of environmental \nmonitoring of industries and product monitoring of food, toy, and service exports illustrates the \nissue. While legislation exists in many countries, domestic enforcement is often weak and often \ndoes not meet the standards of international-quality audits. The Export-Import Bank of India \n(Exim Bank) will review its overall risk management process in the context of the proposed \nfacility to be funded by the Asian Development Bank. It will formulate a corporate policy for \nenvironmental and social management. The guiding principles will be \n(i)  compliance of Exim Bank with applicable environmental, social safeguard, and \nland acquisition and resettlement laws and standards; \n(ii)  integration of environmental and social safeguard aspects of investments into the \ndue-diligence process and independent credit risk review; \n(iii)  regular exchange with leading export finance and export credit and insurance \nagencies  and  professional  groups  like  the  Organisation  for  Economic \nCo-operation and Development on the application of environmental best practice \nin trade finance; \n(iv)  establishment of an environmental and social (including resettlement) screening, \nclassification,  and  assessment  system  to  identify  and  monitor  adverse \nenvironmental and social impact associated with its business activities, wherever \ndeemed necessary for projects supported in importing countries; \n(v)  identification of appropriate mitigation and compensation measures to minimize \nadverse impact in line with international standards; \n(vi)  public disclosure of environmental and social impact information in the review \nprocess; \n(vii)  promotion  of  customer  compliance  with  applicable  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards,  including  resettlement  laws  and  standards  in  India  and  relevant \nexport  destination  countries,  through  appropriate  documentation  of \nenvironmental and social impact studies, approvals by authorities, and site visits; \n(viii)  consultations  with  key  stakeholders  including  affected  people  and \nnongovernment organizations concerned; \n(ix)  where applicable, prompt interaction with the client in the case of violations of \nrelevant laws and standards, to prepare a corrective action plan; and \n(x)  appropriate  staffing  of  Exim  Bank\u2019s  risk  management  unit  and  operational \ndepartments, and the preparation of annual action plans for the development and \noperation of the environmental and social management system (ESMS). \nB.  Environmental and Social Management System \n2.  Exim Bank will establish and adopt an ESMS to be approved by its board, comprising an \nESMS policy, ESMS procedures, and ESMS capacity building plan. In due course, Exim Bank \nwill submit a detailed description of its ESMS.  \n ", "Appendix 3  43\n \n3.  Environmental and social management system policy. As part of the process of \nestablishing  an  ESMS,  Exim  Bank  will  prepare  and  adopt  an  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  policy  statement  to  the  effect  that  (i)  it  will  actively  encourage  and  require  its \ncustomers  to  observe  all  applicable  environmental  and  social  requirements,  and  (ii)  if  the \nrelevant  business  activities  of  a  customer  contravene  applicable  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard requirements, it will take action to understand the reasons for noncompliance and will \ndiscuss with the customer corrective actions acceptable to the relevant authorities.  \n4.  Environmental social management system procedure. Before providing any loans \nfunded under the loan to a customer, Exim Bank will verify that the proposed business activity is \nnot on Asian Development Bank\u2019s list of prohibited investments. Exim Bank will undertake an \ninitial assessment of whether the relevant business activities of the customer (including, where \nappropriate, the project in the importing country for which assistance of Exim Bank has been \nrequested),  in  the  reasonable  opinion  of  Exim  Bank,  have  the  potential  for  adverse \nenvironmental or social impact, or may involve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, or \naffect indigenous people. \n5.  If Exim Bank determines that the relevant business activities of the customer may have a \npotential  significant  adverse  environmental  or  social  impact  or  may  involve  involuntary \nresettlement or affect indigenous people, it will, prior to providing any financial assistance: \n(i)  Consult with and assist in providing advisory or other services to the client;. \n(ii)  Undertake an assessment as part of the lending or investment due-diligence \nprocess  to satisfy  itself  that  the  relevant  business  activities  of  the customer \ncomply with all applicable environmental and social requirements. \n(iii)  Where the relevant business activities of the customer constitute a category A \nproject1 or category B project,2 undertake an environmental assessment that \naddresses the following key environmental and social issues: \n(a)  environmental and social conditions of the investment; \n(b)  requirements  under  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  applicable \ninternational agreements, including but not limited to laws and regulations \ngoverning land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and indigenous \npeople; \n(c)  sustainable development and use of renewable natural resources; \n(d)  protection of human health, cultural properties, and biodiversity, including \nendangered species and sensitive ecosystems; \n(e)  socioeconomic impact; \n(f)  land acquisition and land use;  \n(g)  impact on indigenous peoples and communities;  \n(h)  cumulative  impact  of  existing,  proposed,  and  anticipated  future \ninvestments;  \n(i)  participation of affected parties in the design and review of mitigation and \nrehabilitation measures;  \n(j)  consideration  of  environmentally,  socially,  and  economically  feasible \nalternatives; \n(k)  efficient production, delivery, and use of energy; and  \n                                                 \n \n2  A project is classified as category B if its potential environmental and social impact is less adverse than that of \ncategory A projects.

In the event that \u201cgreenfield\u201d development or significant expansion is involved, the Exim \nBank credit committee will determine whether land acquisition and involuntary resettlement may \nbe involved. If it is not able to reasonably satisfy itself that the relevant business activities of the \ncustomer comply with all applicable national environmental and social requirements and that \ninvoluntary resettlements are not involved, Exim Bank will \n(i)  decline to provide funding to such customer; or \n(ii)  offer funding and associated services, subject to the condition that the customer \nshall implement an agreed corrective action plan within a specified period of time; \nor  \n(iii)  if possible involuntary resettlement cannot be avoided, require the prospective \nborrower to prepare and submit a resettlement plan prepared in accordance with \nthis policy as outlined under section. This plan will need to satisfy Exim Bank that \nresettlement  is  minimized  and  that  affected  people  will  receive  appropriate \ncompensation.  During  the  implementation  of  the  investment  Exim  Bank  will \n(a) monitor the implementation of the resettlement plan, and (b) distribute status \nreports as committed to under the plan. \n7.

Exim Bank will prepare an annual report, in respect of loans extended under \nthe facility, summarizing \n(i)  environmental and social impact of investments supported by it, including the \nprogress of each investment subject to a resettlement plan; \n(ii)  any areas of noncompliance or other issues arising from the environmental and \nsocial safeguards, including resettlement, and prospective investments where \nsuch policies may be triggered; and \n(iii)   periodic reviews of the ESMS, for continuous improvement. \n ", "Appendix 4  45\n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE \nTRADE FINANCE DEVELOPMENT FACILITY  \n1.  Established in 1982, the Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) has the mandate to \nsupport the Government\u2019s foreign trade policy in providing trade finance. Despite its policy role, \nExim Bank has shown remarkable independence and commercial orientation in its business, as \nhighlighted by its moderate profitability, improving asset quality, and favorable cost\u2013income \nratio.  \n2.  Considering India\u2019s large increase of trade since FY2001, which is expected to continue \ninto the foreseeable future, the anticipated further emphasis on India\u2019s south\u2013south trade with \nemerging markets, rapidly rising product standards for trade, and growing cross-border finance \nin the context of the globalization of value chains, Exim Bank\u2019s currently successful operating \nbusiness model needs to be reviewed to meet the following challenges: \n(i)  The surge in demand for trade finance has spurred a level of asset growth that is \npushing Exim Bank toward the limit of the absorptive capacity of its current \nbusiness model. If unchecked, the growth in business may translate into asset \nquality problems. \n(ii)  The current line-of-credit facilities, which entail 100% risk on the part of the \nGovernment, are a comfortable but inefficient use of resources to fund trade with \nriskier emerging markets. Government resources will remain tight under fiscal \nprudence imperatives and the social spending priorities of the Government.  \n(iii)  The traditional short-term trade finance business will increasingly come under \npressure from commercial banks, which have more attractive funding structures \nthrough deposits and an extensive branch network, and there appears to be \nlimited value added in providing classical refinance. \n(iv)  Exim Bank alone will not be able to provide the massive funding required to \nsupport export finance in the future. \n(v)  The current breakup of business units needs to be reviewed to minimize overlap, \nand consideration must be given to the needs of the regional and industry client \nfocus mapped in Exim Bank\u2019s organization chart. \n(vi)  Consistent with good industry practice, a chief risk officer needs to report to top \nmanagement and the board to minimize conflict of interest that may arise in the \nloan  underwriting  process,  and  Exim  Bank  needs  to  implement  the  Basel  II \nframework to remain a highly rated institution. \n(vii)  To promote its clients\u2019 continued competitiveness and maintain their status as \ngood credit risk Exim Bank needs to enter into active dialogue with its clients on \nhow  to  meet  rising  product  standards  in  terms  of  public  health,  labor, \nenvironmental, and social safeguards in line with the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development consensus reached among leading export credit \nagencies, with which Exim Bank is affiliated.     \n3.  Exim Bank\u2019s current Medium-Term Business Strategy 2009\u20132012 is embedded in the \nGovernment\u2019s trade policy and strategy, and foresees its leading role in opening new export \nmarkets and deepening the funding of value chains originating in India through appropriate \nexport finance instruments for domestic small and medium enterprise (SME) exporters and their \ninternational partners. Exim Bank anticipates a continued high need for financing in foreign \nexchange (outstanding foreign currency loans constituted 45% of the total loans outstanding as \nof  31  March  2009),  to  accommodate  the  need  for  faster  modernization  of  manufacturing \nprocesses and services. Exim Bank also aims to broaden its income and maintain its profitability \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \nby enhancing the scope for fee income for guarantees and advisory services, and improving the \nefficiency of treasury operations.  \n4.  Exim Bank needs to address in a more fundamental way the issues highlighted above to \nmeet the changing needs of India\u2019s external trade and trade finance in particular.  \n5.  Impact  and  outcome.  The  proposed  capacity  development  technical  assistance \n(CDTA) will make a major contribution to support Exim Bank, the executing and implementing \nagency for the TA, in undertaking a review of its business model, and subsequently developing \nand implementing a strategy and associated policies to position itself as a leading export \nfinancier in the globalizing trade environment. The following will be taken into account: changing \nmarket demand; supply of commercial trade and project finance; environmental, social, and \nproduct  quality  standards;  and  requirements  associated  with  introducing  the  Basel  II  risk \nmanagement framework. \n6.  The TA will overcome current obstacles to the competitiveness of SMEs in the global \nvalue chain by enabling a business environment conducive to the growth of trade (impact of the \nTA). It will increase access to financing for firms and projects especially in lagging regions \n(expected outcome of the TA). This will have a positive affect down the line as investors gain \nmore experience and can be brought in to increase financing for SMEs and projects. \n7.  Change management team. Consistent with international good practice in business \nstrategy and change management, Exim Bank will establish and fully resource a dedicated team \nof  professionals  with  a  full-time,  professionally  staffed,  and  appropriately  housed  project \nmanagement unit at Exim Bank. The unit head will report to the chair and managing director and \nto the board, who will establish a strategy oversight committee for periodic feedback to the unit \nand the consulting team to be recruited under this TA. International experience suggests that \nthe establishment and appropriate sourcing of the leadership team is critical to ensure good \nunderstanding of the realities of the organization, maximize understanding and support of staff \nthrough effective communication and feedback, and ensure top management ownership of the \nstrategy and its implementation.      \n8.  Consulting team. An international consulting firm with either a presence or a competent \nbusiness partner firm in India will collaborate with the project management unit and report to the \ntop  leadership.  To  qualify  for  the  short listing,  the  firm  must  demonstrate  the  successful \ncompletion of relevant change management projects with banks in Asia. The firm must have \nin-house  expertise  in  formulating  and  executing  bank  change  management,  global  trade \nfinance,  value  chain  analysis  and  development,  project  finance,  and  associated  corporate \nenvironmental and social responsibility systems, and in appropriately staffing and supervising \nsimilar  projects.  The  firm  will  provide  a  team  of  experienced  international  (about \n33 person-months) and national consultants (about 70 person-months) over an overall period of \n36 months from the signing of the consulting agreement. The consulting team will collaborate \nday-to-day with the project management unit. Its findings and recommendations will be vetted \nby a quality review panel of the firm before they are presented to Exim Bank\u2019s top management \nand board.  \n9.  Recruitment. Concurrent with the establishment of the project management unit at Exim \nBank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in close collaboration with Exim Bank management, \nwill start recruiting consultants to implement the services. The quality-based selection method \nwill be used, as it is the most suitable method because of its innovative and flexible approach. \nTo  ensure  appropriate  response,  the  invitation  to  submit  expressions  of  interest  will  be \n ", "Appendix 4  47\n \nadvertised for 30 days, and the request for proposals, for 45 days. The consulting firm will begin \nwork within 6 months of the initial advertisement of the TA, to allow time for the evaluation of \nexpressions of interest and the subsequent evaluation of proposals and contract negotiations in \nclose collaboration with Exim Bank. \n10.  Implementation. The TA will be implemented over 36 months from the date of the \nconsulting contract. Implementation will include the following broad scope, to be finalized in the \ncontext of the recruitment process: \n(i)  identification of broad strategic priorities based on an analysis of India\u2019s trade \nand  trade  finance  environment,  and  identification  of  specific  gaps  to  be \naddressed; \n(ii)  review of Exim Bank\u2019s existing business model and risk management systems \nincluding environmental and social safeguards; \n(iii)  benchmarking with best practice (international Exim finance agencies); \n(iv)  agreement with top management on the gaps to be addressed and on the broad \nparameters of a new corporate strategy to effectively fulfill its mandate; \n(v)  preliminary design of a new business strategy including modified lending and risk \nmanagement  policies  and  procedures,  and  establishment  of  Exim  Bank\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (Appendix  4)  as  well  as \nassociated information systems user requirements; \n(vi)  procurement or modification of information systems (funded by Exim Bank); \n(vii)  pilot-testing and staff training of the modified processes and systems, including \ninformation technology as appropriate; \n(viii)  after  review  of  top  management,  final  design  of  new  business  and  risk \nmanagement, and corporate environmental and social responsibility, policies, \nprocedures, and systems; and \n(ix)  rollout of the strategy and business plan and training of staff. The business plan \nwill include, but not be limited to, the preparation of pre-feasibility and feasibility \nstudies for investment. \n \n11.  Costs and financing. The costs of the TA are estimated at $2.55 million equivalent. \nADB will provide $1,550,000 equivalent on a grant basis from its TA Special Fund. Exim Bank \nwill provide the balance of $1 million equivalent for the staffing of the project management unit, \noffice accommodation, logistical support, and required equipment for office and information \nsystems. Any private sector party receiving (direct or indirect) support under this TA will have to \nprovide matching funds from its own resources.  \n ", "48  Appendix 4 \nTable A4: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Total Cost \nA.

Key Issues  \nThe proposed nonsovereign lending to Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) seeks to enhance overall trade development \nin India. Globalization and the rebalancing of trade toward Asia provides new opportunities for the economic development of \nIndia through greater integration into the world economy. India\u2019s efforts to integrate into the world economy have led to an \nimpressive surge in international trade since the early 1990s. The ratio of international trade to gross domestic product \ndoubled from 19% in 1991 to 48% in 2008. The Foreign Trade Policy 2004\u20132009 targets an increase in exports to $180 billion \nby 2009 from $79 billion in 2004. \n \n2. Design Features. No specific design features are required.
