INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  goal  of  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  is  to  assist  Thailand  in \nachieving inclusive and sustainable rapid economic growth, leading to reduced poverty and a \nhigher income status.1 The country partnership strategy is operationalized through four program \nareas:  infrastructure  development,  finance  sector  development,  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment,  and  regional  cooperation  initiatives.  Under  the  finance  sector  development \nprogram  area,  inclusive  finance  is  of  high  priority.  This  capacity  development  technical \nassistance (TA) project was included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations \nbusiness plan for Thailand, 2015\u20132017.2 During the 2015 country programming mission, the \ngovernment  confirmed  that  financial  inclusion  remained  high  on  Thailand\u2019s  development \nagenda. The TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates and \nfinancing agreements, and terms of reference were agreed during a TA fact-finding mission \nfrom 1 July to 28 August 2015. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Financial inclusion among the low-income segment remains challenging in Thailand. The \nmain financial service providers in the low-income segment are specialized financial institutions \n(SFIs) and semi-formal financial institutions\u2014cooperatives and village funds. ADB provided TA \nto Thailand to support the development of a strategic framework for financial inclusion during \n2011\u20132014.4 Anchored on the findings and recommendations of the technical support, the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) finalized the Master Plan for Financial Inclusion in October 2015.  \nThis capacity development TA project will support the implementation of two strategies of the \nMaster Plan.5 The second strategy of the Master Plan calls for a strengthening of semi-formal \nand specialized financial institutions as these are the important players in Thailand financial \ninclusion landscape.  Under this strategy the role of SFIs will be adjusted so that they can better \nserve the allocation of financial resources for national economic development needs.  The third \nstrategy of the Master Plan involves the development of financial infrastructure for financial \ninclusion and this includes an enhancement of regulatory framework and capacity over semi-\nformal financial institutions.   \n \n3.  Eight SFIs are operating in Thailand, each established with specific financial inclusion \nmandates.  However,  over  time,  many  SFIs  have  drifted  away  from  their  original  financial \ninclusion mission and have offered products competing with commercial banks. One factor \ndiverting SFIs\u2019 attention from their original mission is their performance evaluation framework. \nSFIs\u2019 performance evaluation system is somewhat unclear and the parameters are not specific \nenough in terms of financial inclusion mandates. As SFIs deal with a large population base, \nperformance evaluation parameters on risk management and good governance must also be \nemphasized.  Recognizing the issues, MOF, through the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) and the \nState Enterprise Policy Office, plans to rationalize the strategic directions of SFIs and requested \nthat ADB provide technical support to realign SFIs\u2019 medium-term business plans and their \nperformance evaluation framework and parameters.    \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Thailand, 2013\u20132016. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Thailand, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 August 2015. \n4  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Thailand for the Development of a Strategic Framework for \nFinancial Inclusion. Manila. \n5 The three strategies under the Master Plan for Financial Inclusion are 1) increase income and financial capability of \nlow income population; 2) strengthen financial service providers; 3) develop necessary financial infrastructure for \nfinancial inclusion. \n ", "2 \n \n \n4.  The semi-formal finance sector comprises cooperatives. Over 8,000 cooperatives are in \noperation in Thailand, with over 11.5 million members and total savings of B1.4 trillion at the end \nof 2014. Cooperatives may be divided into seven different types, but the semi-formal finance \nsector is led by savings cooperatives and credit unions, which take deposits from members.6 \nTheir assets accounted for about 5% of overall financial institution assets at the end of 2014. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, through the Cooperative Promotion \nDepartment (CPD) and the Cooperative Auditing Department (CAD), oversees the activities of \ncooperatives in Thailand.  \n \n5.  As  cooperatives  get  larger  with  more  complex  financial  activities,  supervision  over \ncooperatives\u2014especially  deposit-taking  cooperatives\u2014from  a  financial  risk  management \nperspective is perceived to be lagging. CAD and CPD realized that cooperative-based financial \nservices (and deposit-taking cooperatives in particular) should be regulated within the purview \nof  the  financial  system  and  that  regulatory\u2013supervisory  benchmarks  for  cooperative-based \nfinancial services should be compatible with those of financial institutions. Evaluations done by \nthe Cooperative Auditing Department found that in 2012, some 650 cooperatives were involved \nin fraud and financial misconduct, with a total financial loss of over B1 billion. With the relatively \nsmall size of cooperatives\u2019 assets, such misconduct will not affect the stability of the financial \nsystem. However, the effect on members of cooperatives, who are often within the low-income \nsegment, cannot be ignored. CAD and CPD have indicated that the capacity of the cooperative \nregulator  needs  to  be  enhanced  to  supervise  financial  services  proficiently,  and  an  early \nwarning system against financial fraud within the cooperative sector should be developed to \nprotect  low-income  financial  consumers.  The  two  financial  sector  regulators,  the  Bank  of \nThailand and FPO, fully support such propositions. \n  \n6.  ADB has provided support to evaluate the benefit of a mortgage insurance product for \nThai markets through a previous TA project.7 The study found that mortgage insurance could be \nuseful for the Thai mortgage market, with a potential benefit to extend home loan availability to \nlower income households. While the market is not yet familiar with the product, the study \nrecommended that mortgage insurance could be launched on a small scale through an existing \nSFI\u2014the Secondary Mortgage Corporation (SMC). Following the recommendation, the FPO is \nproposing an amendment of the SMC legislation to allow for a mortgage insurance business. \nADB  has  been  requested  to  provide  further  support  to  structure  the  mortgage  insurance \nbusiness once the legislation is passed. \n \n7.  Financial inclusion is a dynamic issue. At the basic level, it is about access to financial \nservices such as savings, credits, and payment for the low-income segment. For a fast-aging \nmiddle-income  country such  as Thailand, financial  inclusion  also  involves  issues  of micro-\ninsurance,  pensions,  and  financing  for  community-based  innovation,  among  others.  While \nstrengthening the existing institutions and structure is crucial, flexibility to adapt to future needs \nis also important. At the moment, SFIs and semi-formal financial institutions provide access to \nbasic financial services but they could develop more products to meet the financial needs of \nlow-income clients. Access to international knowledge and innovations in financial inclusion will \nbe beneficial to these financial institutions and ultimately the population of Thailand. \n                                                \n6  The seven types of cooperatives are agricultural, fishery, land settlement, consumer, service, savings cooperatives, \nand credit unions. \n7  ADB. 2010.

The impact will be stronger inclusive finance for low-income household. The outcome \nwill  be  efficiency  of  specialized  and  semi-formal  financial  institutions  in  providing  inclusive \nfinance improved.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Output 1: Strategic directions of specialized financial institutions rationalized with \nperformance evaluation framework and parameters improved. The TA will help rationalize \nthe strategic directions of SFIs to ensure that they focus on their financial inclusion mandate of \nfilling  gaps  in  the  financial  system  and  do  not  crowd  out  private  sector  financial  service \nproviders. Built on a previous diagnostic study, supply gaps in the financial inclusion landscape \nwill be examined and identified to serve as a basis for the review of SFIs\u2019 roles and strategic \ndirections. The project will help strengthen the capacity of the FPO and SFIs in appraising \nbusiness directions and developing medium-term strategic business plans in accordance with \nthe identified supply gaps.   \n \n10.  The existing performance assessment system of SFIs will be reviewed and revised to \nbring  it  into  line  with  the  adjusted  roles  and  strategic  directions  of  SFIs.  A  performance \nevaluation framework will be developed, with clear and relevant key performance indicators, to \nevaluate the performance of SFIs, taking into consideration SFIs\u2019 financial inclusion mandate, \npublic  service  activities,  and  risk  management  performance.  Parameters  to  assess  the \nperformance  of  SFIs,  according  to  both  commercial  and  public  service  criteria,  will  be \nrecommended.   \n \n11.  Output 2: Mortgage insurance business established. The TA will provide support to \nintroduce mortgage insurance products in Thailand. Once the amendment to the SMC Act, 1997 \nis  approved,  the  project  will  help  the  SMC  develop  the  mortgage  insurance  business \norganization and structure mortgage insurance products. The TA will also provide capacity \nbuilding to the SMC focusing on approval operations and risk management.    \n \n12.  Output  3:  Regulatory  and  supervision  capacity  over  cooperative  sector \nstrengthened.  The  TA  will  undertake  an  in-depth  review  of  cooperative-based  financial \nservices. The project will propose an improved regulatory and governance framework as well as \noversight  structure  for  cooperative-based  financial  services  in  general  and  deposit-taking \ncooperatives in particular, taking into consideration both financial sector stability and financial \nconsumer  protection  objectives.  To  enhance  financial  consumer  protection  for  cooperative \nmembers, the TA will help develop early warning indicators to assess financial risks for deposit-\ntaking cooperatives. The project will also help strengthen the capacity of cooperative regulators \non financial service supervision.   \n        \n13.  Output 4: Financial inclusion knowledge products. Apart from knowledge products to \nbe produced under outputs 1 to 3, the TA plans to generate other knowledge products related to \nfinancial inclusion issues as requested by the government. These will include but not be limited \nto briefing papers and workshops. At least one international knowledge sharing forum will be \norganized,  with  proceedings  from  the  conferences  published.  The  international  knowledge \nsharing forum will be organized, leveraging the cooperation set forth in the framework for \n ", "4 \n \ncooperation between Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency and Thailand\u2019s MOF.8 Such knowledge \nproducts  will  help  equip  relevant  agencies  to  cope  with  the  evolving  financial  inclusion \nlandscape both in terms of needs and innovation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,250,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The proceeds of the \nTA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies, meeting and workshop venues, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The FPO will be the executing agency. Other agencies involved in the implementation of \nthe TA include the Bank of Thailand, CAD, CPD, the State Enterprise Policy Office, and the \nSMC.   \n \n17.  Two  consulting  firms  and  three  individual  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  to \nundertake the TA activities; about 51 person-months of consulting services will be required, \ncomprising 19 person-months of international and 32 person-months of national consulting \nservices.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nconsulting  firms  will  be  recruited,  using  fixed-budget  selection  method.  Consultants  to  be \nengaged through an international financial inclusion firm are an international financial sector \nexpert (6 person-months), an international financial inclusion expert (7 person-months), and an \ninternational  financial  sector  supervision  specialist  (3  person-months).  Consultants  to  be \nengaged through an international mortgage insurance development firm are an international \nmortgage insurance advisor (3 person-months), a national legal expert (2 person-months), and \na  national  risk  management  expert  (3  person-months).  Three  national  consultants  will  be \nengaged as individuals, including a national public finance specialist (6 person-months), a \nnational  financial  sector  specialist  (3  person-months),  and  a  national  project  coordinator \n(18 person-months).

The TA activities, including consultation meetings, training workshops, and conference, \nwill be implemented from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017. The implementation of the TA \nwill  be  monitored  on  a  regular  basis  through  close  consultation  between  ADB\u2019s  Thailand \nResident Mission, the executing agency, and the consulting team. A steering committee will be \nset up by the executing agency and will comprise all relevant agencies to provide guidance to \nand evaluate the quality of the work of the consulting team. TA progress reports will be reviewed \nand any issues arise will be discussed in a timely manner. \n   \n                                                \n8  A letter of cooperation was signed between Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency and Thailand\u2019s MOF. The objective \nof the framework is to promote the development of sound financial regulatory mechanisms and financial markets \nthrough exchanges of experience and expertise in the areas of small and medium-sized enterprise financing, \nfinancial inclusion, insurance industry, resolution of financial institutions, and other areas to be agreed. \n ", "  5 \nIV.
