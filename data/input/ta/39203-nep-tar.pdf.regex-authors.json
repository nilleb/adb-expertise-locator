The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved in December 2004 a loan for the Gender \nEquality and Empowerment of Women (GEEOW) Project1 in Nepal to facilitate a process of \neconomic, social, legal, and political empowerment among poor rural women and members of \nother disadvantaged groups, including ethnic and low-caste women. The Department of Women \nDevelopment (DWD) of the Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare (MWCSW) is \nresponsible for overall management, implementation, and coordination of activities to meet the \noutcome  of  the  Project.  To  reach  the  project  beneficiaries  effectively,  the  day-to-day \nmanagement of the Project is delegated to the women development officers (WDOfs) of the \nwomen development offices (WDO), the decentralized DWD offices at district level. During the \npreparation of the GEEOW Project, it was recognized that additional technical assistance (TA) \nwould be needed to strengthen the managerial and institutional capabilities of DWD not only to \nmanage the activities under the ADB loan, but also to become an institution able to mainstream \ngender within local governments and to make the district development plans (DDPs) responsive \nto women\u2019s needs. To respond to this need, a concept paper was prepared and endorsed for \nfunding by the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund in April 2004. During the processing \nmissions for the GEEOW Project, the goal, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, \nand financing arrangements of the TA were finalized.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Against the backdrop of continued political instability, escalation of the insurgency, and \nno credible progress towards creating an environment for holding parliamentary elections since \nthe  Parliament  was  dissolved  in  May  2002,  the  Government  was  dismissed  by  Royal \nProclamation on 1 February 2005, when the King assumed all executive powers, imposed a \nstate of emergency, and suspended some constitutional rights. The state of emergency was \nlifted on 29 April 2005, bringing some thawing of Nepal\u2019s strained relations with the international \ncommunity.  However,  the  situation  of  security  and  constitutional  rights  remains  virtually \nunchanged.  Due  to  the  events  and  the  uncertainties  with  regard  to  the  future  delivery  of \ndevelopment assistance, ADB has taken a cautious approach to ensure that its assistance is \nsafely and effectively delivered. As a result, the implementation of the GEEOW Project was \ndelayed and the assessment, planning, and strengthening of the managerial and institutional \ncapacity of the Executing Agency (EA) have not yet started.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  MWCSW has the mandate to mainstream women\u2019s empowerment and gender into all \ngovernment programs and policies. Programs for empowerment and gender mainstreaming are \nexecuted by DWD, which was originally formed as the Women Development Section of the \nMinistry of Local Development to implement the Production Credit for Rural Women Project in \n1982,  through  its  75  district-level  women  development  sections.  The  section  became  a \ndepartment  (the  Women  Development  Department)  in  1991,  and  then  was  transferred  to \nMWCSW  as  DWD  in  2000.  During  two  decades  of  experience  implementing  projects  to \nempower women in rural Nepal, DWD has built a national infrastructure and network that \nreaches every district of Nepal. DWD staff are noted for their dedication and commitment to \ndevelopment principles and generally enjoy the strong support of line agencies, nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and the community at large. DWD has the mandate to improve the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women Project. Manila (for $10 million, approved \non 16 December 2004). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 19 May 2005. \n ", "2   \nquality  of  life,  increase  the  socioeconomic  status  of  women,  and  bring  gender  equity  in \nNepalese society. It focuses specifically on the income-poor and disadvantaged women and \ntheir households through the implementation of the countrywide Women Development Program. \n \n4.   In its 10th National Plan and Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Government explicitly \nrecognizes the strong need for reducing poverty by promoting gender equality and empowering \npoor women, particularly in the poorer rural areas of Nepal. The Plan seeks to address gender, \nethnic, and caste-related disparities by mainstreaming gender in the implementation of key \nsectoral  programs,  empowering  women,  and  mainstreaming  the  historically  excluded \ncommunities. At the same time, the Government is implementing the decentralization strategy of \nthe Local Self-Governance Act of 1999 as an effective means to facilitate participation of the \nrural  poor  in  decision-making  and  development  processes.  The  Act  envisages  therefore  a \nsignificant change of mandate for line agencies at the district level and below. As planning \ndecisions  will  be  made  at  the  Village  Development  Committee  (VDC)  level  and  then \nconsolidated into DDPs approved by the District Development Committee (DDC), line agencies \nwill gradually be devolved to be accountable to deliver programs on behalf of the DDC rather \nthan their central ministries.  Agriculture, health, and education are the first line agencies to be \nfully devolved, and DWD will follow in due course. As a step toward this devolution, the mandate \nof DWD has also changed, and in July 2003 a cabinet ruling was issued to define WDO as the \nfocal agency at the district level for matters relating to women, minors, the disabled, the aged, \nand NGOs, i.e., representing the full mandate of MWCSW.  \n \n5.  The change in the DWD mandate will require WDO to act as facilitator and coordinator \nat  the  district  level  for  issues  concerning  women  and  gender  equality,  rather  than  as  an \nimplementor of programs. At the district level, WDO will have to (i) plan, monitor, coordinate, \nand evaluate the implementation of gender-related projects; (ii) network with NGOs and other \nstakeholders working for women\u2019s rights; and (iii) establish and develop WDO as the central \ninformation unit for matters relating to women. At the central level, DWD will become more of an \noversight agency to ensure that women have appropriate access to development programs. \nThese changes present important opportunities for promoting gender equality and empowering \nwomen. However, DWD needs substantial capacity building to carry out this new mandate \neffectively and to make the transition from being a direct service deliverer to being a catalyst \nand facilitator in mainstreaming gender issues.  \n \n6.  DWD is not only the newly recognized gender focal point at the district level but also the \nEA of the ADB-funded GEEOW Project. The Project\u2019s objective is to improve the socioeconomic \nconditions of poor rural women, including ethnic and low-caste women, through a process of \nempowerment by (i) improving their access to and control of assets and strengthening their \ncapabilities; (ii) building group support and solidarity to undertake collective action to engage, \ninfluence, and hold institutions accountable; and (iii) reforming government institutions to include \npreviously marginalized women and to increase the access of women to mainstream assets and \ndevelopment opportunities. As the causes of disempowerment of women are interwoven to such \na degree that one cannot be tackled in isolation from the others, the Project is adopting a \nholistic and cross-sectoral approach. The Project will use participatory processes that enable \nthe targeted women to determine their own strategies for empowerment. The GEEOW Project, \nbuilding on lessons learned from DWD past programs, adopts an approach that is new to DWD. \nIn addition, given the new role of DWD, WDOf will procure the services of other agencies, such \nas community-based organizations, NGOs, private sector providers, and district line agencies, ", "                          3\nand will oversee them in project implementation.3 A substantial capacity building for DWD to \nimplement the GEEOW Project successfully is needed. 4 \n \n7.  To  clarify  goals,  roles,  and  strategies  between  MWCSW  and  DWD;  to  facilitate \nimplementation  of  gender  programs,  and  to  provide  training,  a  full  organizational  audit  of \nMWCSW was carried out in 2003 by the Mainstreaming Gender Equity Program of the United \nNations Development Programme. To complement this audit, a full institutional audit of DWD, \nthe context of MWCSW and other institutions dealing with women\u2019s and gender issues, was \nplanned  to  be  carried  out  at  the  start  of  the  GEEOW  Project,  to  ensure  that  (i)  DWD\u2019s \ncapabilities match its new roles and responsibilities, not only as gender focal point at the district \nlevel but also as EA of an innovative development project; and (ii) DWD human resource and \nprofessional development plans for staff at all levels are set out in accordance with the needs of \nthe department. Given the nature of the institutional audit, its outcome is needed not only for  \nimplementing the GEEOW Project but also for other ongoing DWD development activities. \nTherefore, this TA is designed to proceed with planning capacity building for DWD and start the \ninstitutional  audit  before  the  GEEOW  Project  so  as  to  have  the  human  resources  and \nprofessional development plans for DWD staff finalized before any capacity-building activities \nare planned and implemented.5 \n \n8.  To fulfill the expanded and new role of facilitating, monitoring, supervising, and technical \nbackstopping rather than project implementation, DWD\u2019s capacity at all levels needs to be \nenhanced.  The  central-level  DWD  will  require  upgrading  of  systems  capability  to  monitor, \nevaluate, and report; and improved capacity to push on with gender mainstreaming activities \nwithin  line  ministries.  At  the  district  level,  WDO  staff  will  need  training  and  professional \ndevelopment to monitor the work of and coordinate with various implementing agencies, such \nas district line agencies, NGOs, and other agencies involved in empowering women. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA is DWD\u2019s transition from being directly delivering development \nprograms for women to being a catalyst and facilitator in promoting empowerment of women \nand mainstreaming gender and therefore to fully take on its new roles and responsibilities. The \noutcome is the strengthened institutional and managerial capabilities of DWD to efficiently and \neffectively manage, coordinate, and monitor its development programs, in line with its new role \nand  mandate  as  gender  focal  point  at  the  district  level  and  lower  administrative  level.  In \nparticular, the TA will assist DWD, as EA of the Project, in building new and strengthening \nexisting capacities and skills to ensure that the needs of GEEOW beneficiaries are met and to \nmonitor that results have been achieved, through training for the central project management \nteam (CPMT) and district project team of the GEEOW Project. This will help DWD become an \ninstitution able not only to influence and guide national, district, and lower level administration \nunits  in  incorporating  gender  issues  in  their  policies,  programs,  and  projects,  but  also  to \nmanage, supervise, and monitor agencies implementing development activities for meaningful \nempowerment of women.  \n                                                 \n3  Outsourcing of activities is already ongoing based on DWD working manuals. However, these manuals will be \nrevised at the outset of the GEEOW Project.  \n4  The GEEOW Project is specifically designed to respond to some of the underlying causes of the insurgency and \nwill therefore  be implementable even in conflict-affected districts. \n5  The institutional audit is foreseen by the GEEOW Project as a prerequisite for all Project activities. \n ", "4   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will concentrate on strengthening (i) the management capacity of the DWD and \nWDOf, and (ii) DWD capacity for advocacy, by providing consulting services for 2 years. After \nthe institutional audit is implemented and on the basis of its results, the consultants will assist in \n(i) planning, designing, and implementing appropriate institutional strengthening and training \npackages for DWD; (ii) developing the capacity of DWD to play its new advocacy role for \nempowerment of women and gender equality; and (iii) developing the local capacity of DWD in \noutsourcing  the  implementation  of  subprojects  and  manage,  monitor,  and  evaluate \nsubcontracts. At least a 1 year overlap with the GEEOW Project\u2019s implementation is expected, \nwhen the capacity-building activities funded under the Project and this TA will complement each \nother to allow implementation of the human resource and professional development plans for \nDWD staff, at both central and district levels. The TA will have two components: (i) institutional \naudit, and (ii) training. \n \n1.  Institutional Audit \n \n11.  The first activity of the TA will be the external institutional audit of DWD, a process by \nwhich the institutional development specialists check that procedures are in place across DWD, \nthe context of MWCSW and other institutions dealing with women and gender issues, to ensure \nthat  (i)  quality,  integrity,  and  standards  of  provision  and  outcomes  are  in  place;  and  (ii)  \ncapabilities (skills and training) match the new roles and responsibilities expected from DWD,  \nfrom VDC level up to the central Government. The TA will assist in setting out the human \nresource and professional development plans for all levels of staff DWD, based on the needs \nand capacity assessment performed during the full institutional audit at the start of the TA.  \nDWD and the consultants will develop a 5-year training plan for DWD staff at all levels to be \nimplemented  during  the  TA  and  the  GEEOW  Project.  Training  activities  in  the  5-year \nprofessional development plans that are not implemented under the TA will be carried over to \nthe GEEOW Project. \n \n2.  Training \n \n12.  The TA will build the capacity of the management and technical staff of DWD at central, \ndistrict, and lower administrative levels. Based on the findings of the institutional audit, the TA \nwill support training for DWD staff as needed. The subjects, to be further defined based on the \nfindings of the institutional audit, are tentatively (i) planning and gender budgeting, (ii) structure \nand policy-making process of the national Government, and how to prepare messages and \ninformation about priority issues for women at the community level that will be relevant to \nnational agencies; (iii) selection of implementing agencies for outsourcing project activities; (iv) \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  and  recruitment  of  consultants;  and  (v)  definition  and \nidentification of project performance monitoring indicators, including qualitative and process \nindicators.  Training  will  be  a  combination  of  (i)  on-the-job  training,  by  working  with  the \nconsultants\u2019  team;  and  (ii)  training  programs  for  which  the  modules  and  materials  will  be \ndeveloped under the TA and transferred to the CPMT of the GEEOW Project once the TA is \ncompleted. \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $353,000 equivalent comprising $88,000 in \nforeign exchange and $265,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested ", "                          5\nADB to finance $300,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $212,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Gender \nand Development Cooperation Fund, administered by ADB. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $53,000, by providing two counterpart and \nthree support staff, office space with proper communications facilities in DWD, one vehicle, and \nother related facilities. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  DWD will be the EA for the TA and will be responsible for overall coordination with ADB. \nOne TA director (DWD director level) and one counterpart staff will be assigned to the TA. The \nTA  director  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  management  of  the  TA  and  overseeing  \nimplementation of the institutional audit. The counterpart staff will be responsible for managing \nthe capacity building activities. The TA director will closely coordinate with the soon-to-be-\nestablished  CPMT  of  the  GEEOW  Project  and  its  project  manager.  DWD  will  provide  full \nadministrative and technical support to the consultants.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years and is expected to begin in December 2005 \nand to be completed in December 2007. Consulting services for the TA will total 76 person-\nmonths: 4 person-months from an international (institutional development specialist) and 72 \nperson-months  from  domestic  consultants.  The  expertise  required  for  domestic  consulting \nservices,  in  person  months,  is  as  follows:  institutional  development  specialist  (18),  project \nmanagement expert (24), gender planning specialist (18), and procurement specialist (12). \nThese skills are viewed as relevant to DWD capacity-building needs.  Outline terms of reference \n(TOR) for the consultants are in Appendix 3. However, the specific TOR for the TA consultants \nmay be refined, as appropriate, following completion of the institutional audit. The international \nspecialist, in close cooperation with the domestic institutional development specialist, will be \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  institutional  audit.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  on  an \nindividual basis by ADB, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consultants\u2019 reporting \nrequirements will include (i) an inception report within 3 weeks of TA commencement, (ii) a final \nreport summarizing the achievements of the TA and what is left to be implemented under the \nGEEOW Project, and (iii) brief bimonthly progress reports, when other reports are not due. \nEquipment for the TA activities will be financed by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement and will become property of the Government upon completion of the Project. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof Nepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund for \nCapacity Building for Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nChanged role of DWD  \u2022  Development  \u2022  Progress reports of   \u2022  There is political \nfrom directly delivering  activities of local  DWD development  commitment to fully \ndevelopment programs  bodies (DDPs)  programs  decentralize \nfor women to being the  reflecting women\u2019s  \u2022  Quarterly progress  Government decision- \ngender focal point at  and disadvantaged  reports of  the  making process  at \ndistrict level and lower  ethnic/caste  GEEOW Project  district level and lower \nadministrative level   groups\u2019 priority  \u2022  Minutes of meetings of  administrative level. \nneeds  DDCs  \u2022  DDC members accept \n\u2022  DWD outsourcing  \u2022  DDPs  and understand new role \ndevelopment  \u2022  Interviews with VDCs,  of DWD staff. \nactivities  NGOs    \n\u2022  Gender issues of    Risk \nlocal communities  \u2022  Budget allocation for \nbrought to the  DWD programs is \nattention of district  enough. \nand national   \nagencies \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened  \u2022  Number of  \u2022  Progress reports of   \u2022  Trained staff are \ninstitutional and  outsourcing  DWD development  retained in DWD for at \nmanagerial capabilities  contracts with  programs  least 3 years. \nof DWD, in line with its  development  \u2022  Work plans of DWD  \u2022  Audit recommendations \nnew role and mandate  partners  staff  are supported by \nas gender focal point  \u2022  Number of project  \u2022  Quarterly progress  MWCSW and DDC \nactivities monitored  reports of  the  members. \nby DWD staff  GEEOW Project  \u2022  Training modules are \n\u2022  Number of  \u2022  Joint ADB/DWD  relevant and appropriate. \nevaluation reports  review missions   \non DWD     \ndevelopment   Risk \nactivities  \u2022  DWD staff at village level \n\u2022  Performance of  cannot work due to lack \nDWD in managing  of security. \nand monitoring   \nGEEOW Project \nand other \ndevelopment \nprograms \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  The GEEOW Project \n1.
