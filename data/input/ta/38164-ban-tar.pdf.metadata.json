During the 2006 Country Partnership Strategy Confirmation Mission, the Government \nrequested ADB\u2019s continuing assistance for gas sector development activities. Subsequently, \nADB included a Gas Sector Development Program PPTA for 2007 and a follow-up loan in the \n2008 business plan.1 A Fact Finding Mission (Mission) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nvisited Bangladesh from 10 to 15 April 2007 to evaluate the readiness for project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) for the proposed Bangladesh Gas Sector Development Program \n(the Program).2 The preliminary project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Non-commercial  energy,  primarily  biomass,  accounts  for  almost  two-thirds  of  total \nenergy consumption in Bangladesh. Natural gas accounts for about 70% of commercial energy. \nNatural gas will provide most of the current and future commercial energy requirements, and the \ngas market needs to be expanded to optimize the use of natural gas resources and support \neconomic development. Although Bangladesh has been producing natural gas for over three \ndecades, most of its major fields are underdeveloped and have not been properly delineated. \nThere are widely varying assessments of the country\u2019s potential natural gas resources. Total \nproven recoverable gas reserves in Bangladesh from 23 fields (18 in the public and 5 in the \nprivate sector) are estimated at 20.5 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which 6.8 TCF has so far been \nconsumed. The current net recoverable reserves stand at 13.7 TCF, with potentially substantial \nunderdeveloped and/or undiscovered natural gas reserves. \n \n3.  Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Minerals Corporation (Petrobangla) coordinates the gas sector \nactivities in the country while the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) of the Ministry \nof  Power,  Energy,  and  Mineral  Resources  (MPEMR)  provides  the  overall  policy  direction. \nPetrobangla carries out its gas business through nine operating companies.3 Performance in \nthe gas sector has been below its potential because of low gas extraction, lack of internal \ninvestment, and limited use of the domestic market. Also, the price of natural gas in Bangladesh \nremains low compared with neighboring countries. The underpricing of domestic gas use leads \nto a high opportunity cost in terms of foregone resources that could have been mobilized to \nsupport  investment  within  and  outside  the  sector,  especially  given  the  country\u2019s  massive \ndevelopment financing needs. \n \n4.  The Government of Bangladesh (the Government) recognizes the need to introduce \ngradual  reforms  aimed  at  commercializing  the  sector  and  placing  some  distance  between \noperations, regulations and policy making. Although individual, independent companies have \nbeen established (the separate nine operating companies mentioned earlier), there has been \n                                                 \n1  The indicative programming figures are a $60 million Asian Development Fund loan for the policy component and \n$300 million for investment support.  \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 April 2007. \n3 The gas sector companies are: Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Limited, engaged in \nexploration and production; Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited and Sylhet Gas Fields Limited, involved in \ngas field development and production; Gas Transmission Company Limited, involved in transmission; Titas Gas \nTransmission  and  Distribution  Company  Limited  (\u201cTitas\u201d),  Bakhrabad  Gas  System  Limited,  Jalalabad  Gas \nTransmission and Distribution Systems Limited and Paschimanchal Gas Company Limited involved in transmission \nand/or distribution; and Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited, involved in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and \ncompressed natural gas (CNG) marketing. Titas, being the oldest and largest, operates in the franchise area of \nDhaka division (excluding greater Faridpur district) and Brahmanbaria district. Bakhrabad Gas System Limited \nserves the market in Chittagong division excluding  Brahmanbaria district. Jalalabad Gas Transmission and \nDistribution System Limited serves the market in Sylhet division while Paschimanchal Gas Company Limited \noperates in the franchise area in Rajshahi division.  \n ", "2   \nlimited delegation of authority from the Government to the management of these sector entities, \nand from the management to the staff.  \n   \n5.  ADB has been involved in the gas sector intermittently over the last 25 years, and \nprovided eight loans totaling $446 million. As in other countries, the role of ADB has evolved \nfrom a provider of funds for individual products to a more proactive and comprehensive role \ninvolving technical advice for project preparation and policy advice in implementing sector \nreforms. Currently, there are two active gas sector loans and one advisory technical assistance \n(TA) project. The Dhaka Clean Fuel Project is almost completed,4 while the Gas Transmission \nand Development Project was declared effective 1 year after loan approval, with implementation \nnow progressing well.5 ADB also provided advisory TA to assess the role of the private sector in \nenergy sector development, with a final tripartite workshop held on 24 April 2007.6  \n \n6.    Several major initiatives were taken under the Gas Transmission and Development \nProject (GTDP), including the development of the Gas Sector Reform Roadmap (GSRR). The \nGSRR includes (i) a program and a strategy for development of old and new gas production \nfields, (ii) expansion of gas transmission and distribution pipelines, (iii) a mechanism for gas \nsector policy formulation and introduction of required regulatory instruments, (iv) strengthening of \ncorporate and financial governance of gas sector companies, (v) private sector participation, (vi) \nprice reforms, and (vii) system loss reduction plans. These activities are to be undertaken in \nparallel with the implementation of the GTDP.  \n \n7.    The Government recognizes that while an improved gas sector has the potential to \ncontribute significantly to the development of the economy, it would have to be effectively \nmanaged to maximize its role in poverty reduction and ensure an equitable distribution of \nbenefits. The Government is actively following the Gas Sector Master Plan prepared in 2006 by \nthe Government with assistance from the World Bank.7 This plan outlines a vision for gas sector \nrestructuring, ownership, private sector participation, and regulation. Progress in implementing \npolicy  reforms  can  be  improved  significantly,  however,  and  it  is  important  to  maintain  the \nmomentum created by previous assistance and progress. Several elements stand out as key \nareas for focus and improvement.  \n \n8.    One critical element is security of the gas supply. Numerous analyses have shown a \npositive  relation  between  gas  consumption  and  increases  in  gross  domestic  product  in \nBangladesh. At the same time, the country\u2019s rate of gas consumption is alarmingly close to its \nproduction and delivery capabilities. The certain and probable gas reserves available today will \nsupport the country\u2019s desired level of economic growth until only 2011 (or 2018 at most); a key \nchallenge is to assure, though additional exploration, development and production activities, the \ncontinued availability of reliable gas supplies. The challenge will be to create an environment that \nwill  provide  funding  to  the  domestic  operating  companies  for  such  activities,  and  to  attract \ninvestment from experienced foreign companies. \n \n9.    This will require focusing on another priority element, the design and implementation of \ncompetitive and equitable pricing policies. The sector needs to retain enough funds to not only \nproperly maintain the system but also to carry out the exploration, development and production \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n7  In parallel, ADB assisted preparation of the Power Sector Master Plan in 2006. \n ", "  3\nfunctions needed to ensure security of the supply. It is well known that proper pricing prevents \nwasteful resource use. At present, gas pricing in Bangladesh is based on a complex system of \ncross-subsidies, and certain elements within the domestic economy may be unable to support gas \nprice increases. Affordability should be maintained through development of subsidies that can be \napplied directly to the targeted end-consumers, without involving the entire gas sector in such \nsocial activities. \n \n10.    Another priority element in gas sector reform is that system losses need to be reduced to \nlevels consistent with a properly maintained and operated system. Beyond technical solutions \nsuch as improved maintenance to reduce leaks, institutional solutions and good governance in the \ngas sector operating companies are required to ultimately reduce losses. Transparency with \nrespect to transmission quantities, delivery to individual off-take points, and collections associated \nwith those points must be enhanced through improved book keeping, metering and collection \nprocedures. Regional management teams must be given incentives to lower losses and increase \nprofits, and be given adequate oversight powers. \n \n11.    Proper coordination between the power and gas sectors is crucial, as the power sector is \nthe largest consumer of gas (at present more than 90% of the country\u2019s power is generated with \ngas). As both sectors are capital intensive, efficient, least-cost investment solutions for both \nsectors cannot occur without close coordination. Proper planning of the gas transmission and \ndistribution network requires knowledge of the long-term plans of the power sector with respect to \ncapacity addition (and the location of added capacity); likewise, planning for future gas-fired power \ngeneration plants must take into account the constraints of and future investment plans for the gas \nsector.   \n \n12.   Institutional capacity development in policy making, monitoring and system and investment \nplanning is another key element of gas sector viability, and is needed to ensure progress in the \nother  key  elements  mentioned  above.  Human  resource  development  to  promote  adequate \ncontinuity  of  trained  personnel  throughout  Petrobangla  and  its  nine  gas  sector  operating \ncompanies is an important need. Institutional capacity development should also focus on the \nBangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), to facilitate the objective of separating the \ngas sector\u2019s policy-making, regulatory and operational functions. It is thus important to ensure \nadequate institutional capacity at BERC from the outset, as adequate gas sector governance \ndepends on a viable and empowered regulator with the skills to carry out audit functions and \nemploy objective criteria in regulating the sector. A key lesson from past interventions is that \nsector reforms take time, and that a blend of policy promotion and investment assistance can \nyield the most progress.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Government prepare a new gas sector development \nprogram to build on the progress from the ongoing project. The program will include (i) a policy \nagenda, (ii) priority investments, and (iii) an institutional capacity development component for \nthe gas sector. The Government has proposed several investments for ADB financing under the \nensuing Program. These have been selected from the Gas Sector Master Plan subprojects. The \npolicy component will include an agenda for gas sector development and necessary budgetary \nsupport. \n \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will be provided in two stages, with the first component focusing on policy and \ninstitutional capacity development. Activities include reviewing the sector road map and gas \nsector  master  plan,  and  identifying  additional  institutional  capacity  development  needs  for \nPetrobangla,  its  operating  companies,  and  relevant  government  agencies.  Findings  will  be \ncombined into a coherent policy matrix. The second component focuses on investment, and will \ninvolve (i) reviewing project proposals and other documents to define the scope of the different \ncomponents for financing under the ensuing program; (ii) making a technical review of the \nproposals to confirm their suitability and soundness and preparing implementation schedules for \nthe selected components; and (iii) undertaking financial and economic, environmental, social, \npoverty reduction, and institutional analyses of the investment feasibility studies prepared by the \nGovernment. The ensuing program activities are not expected to be located in or pass through \nareas of significant settlement or use by indigenous people. However, some of the proposed \ninvestment components consist of construction of gas pipelines and will involve land acquisition \nand potentially some resettlement. Proper resettlement plans will be developed in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines. \n \n15.  Key activities include the following. \n \n(i)  Preparing a report that analyzes the potential for gas sector development.  \n(ii)  Preparing a report that assesses policy and non-policy barriers to improving gas \nsector development.  \n(iii)  Identifying a policy matrix for the promotion of institutional capacity development in \nthe gas sector.  \n(iv)  Preparing an internal report that analyzes the potential for economic growth and \nsocial development in program areas, with particular reference to expanding natural \ngas supply and distribution.  \n(v)  Developing an investment package that identifies relevant subprojects.  \n(vi)  Performing detailed financial, economic, environmental, social, poverty reduction, \nand institutional analyses of the identified subprojects, including resettlement plans \nas necessary.  \n(vii)  Reviewing cost estimates, financing plans and procurement packages.   \n(viii)  Preparing an estimate of potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the \nsubprojects. \n(ix)  Reviewing and assisting in finalizing procurement packages, bid documents, terms of \nreference,  expertise  requirements,  and  person-month  estimates  for  consulting \nservices in support of the project design work and implementation of the ensuing \nloan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $575,000 \nequivalent.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $145,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency  costs  through  in-kind  contributions,  including  office  accommodation  and  facilities, \ncounterpart staff, data and other information. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \npresented in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing program. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be Petrobangla, which will appoint a senior \nstaff member as the project director. The TA mainly will finance the services of international and \nnational consultants. The TA will be carried out over a 5-month period by an internationally \nrecognized consulting firm in association with national consultants. The TA will commence in \nSeptember 2007 and will be completed by January 2008. The consultants for the TA will be \nrecruited by ADB on the basis of submission of simplified technical proposals in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection procedure. The national consultants, who will be \nassociated with the international consultants, will also be engaged by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  International  consultants  will  procure  the \nequipment to be financed under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time), through direct purchase procedures with quotations from \nat least three suppliers.  A TA project management office will be established in Petrobangla and \nwill  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  management  of  the  TA  and  will  coordinate  with  all \ngovernmental and non-government stakeholders of the proposed Program.  \n \n18.  International consultants will be engaged for a total of 13 person-months, and national \nconsultants for 26 person-months. The consulting team will comprise international experts in (i) \ngas sector policy development, (ii) natural gas system analysis, (iii) natural gas economics, and \n(iv)  financial  analysis.  The  national  experts  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  gas  sector  policy \ndevelopment, (ii) institutional analysis and development, (iii) environment impact assessment, \n(iv) social development assessment, (v) financial management and restructuring, (vi) power \nsector assessment, (vii) gas economics, and (viii) gas policy. The outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  International (3 person-months) and national (3 person-months) gas sector development \nspecialists will be recruited for policy agenda preparatory work at the earliest opportunity, and \nwill therefore be recruited as individual consultants immediately after TA approval, but this will \nnot affect the total scheduled consultant time (13 person-months of international and 26 person-\nmonths of national consultants). The individually recruited consultants will be responsible for \nidentifying and summarizing a gas sector policy matrix according to the gas sector reform \nagenda and GSRR. The detailed TOR can be found in Section III of Appendix 4. \n \n20.  The consultant team (i.e., the consulting firm) will submit an inception report two weeks \nafter TA commencement and a draft final report four months later. The Government and ADB \nwill provide comments and these will be discussed at tripartite meetings. At the end of 5 months, \nthe consultants will submit the final report incorporating government and ADB comments on the \ndraft final report. During the TA processing stage, the Government has fully concurred with the \nimpact, outcome, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and TOR of the \nproposed TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $575,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh  for  Preparing  the  Gas  Sector  Development  Program,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased pace of  Increased economic growth  Government of  Continued focus by the \neconomic development    Bangladesh annual  Government to reform \n    reports on per capita  the gas sector and \n  income and labor  develop gas \n  productivity in project  infrastructure \nareas    \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced use of natural  Use of gas increased from 1,700  Ministry of Power,  Continued strong \ngas by consumers,  MMCFD and 2,100 MMCFD at  Energy, and Mineral  energy demand  \nindustry, and commercial  peak gas demand  Resources data and   \nusers     statistics   \n  Percentage of population using    Risk \n  gas as primary fuel increased  System operations  Adequate gas \n  from 6% to 10% by 2012  report from gas  production in the fields \n    entities  \n  Improved ambient and indoor air   \nImproved ambient and  quality (baseline to be  Ministry of Health \nindoor air quality through  determined during project  statistics on \nprovision of cleaner fuel  implementation)  respiratory health in \n    project areas \n     \n     \nPPTA Outcome  Approved and implemented TA  TA reports \nPreparation of the   \nrequired technical,   \nfinancial and economic \nanalyses, and review of \nsocial and environmental \nassessment reports for \nthe proposed BAN: Gas \nSector Development \nProgram. \n \nOutputs       \n(PPTA)       \n       \n1.

Development of the \ngas sector is also strongly connected to poverty reduction. As a clean source of energy, gas will ensure that the poor \nwill benefit, as they bear a larger share of the adverse impacts of pollution and environmental degradation.  \n \nWomen will also benefit from having improved and more reliable access to gas, as they can reduce the considerable \ntime they otherwise spend collecting fuel wood. \n \nIn addition, Bangladesh\u2019s agriculture and agro- industries will also benefit from the development of gas-based \nfertilizers. \n \nPolicy reforms that would lead to private sector development in the sector will also support improvements in service \naccountability, transparency and accessibility. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nConsultants will undertake a study to assess the impact of gas sector development on prices and tariffs.
