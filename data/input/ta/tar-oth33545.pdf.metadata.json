INTRODUCTION\n1. The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  South  Pacific  Regional  Environment\nProgramme (SPREP) have developed a coordinated effort to assist the Pacific developing\nmember  countries  (PDMCs)  with  sustainable  utilization  of  their  natural  resources  through\ncapacity building to promote traditional environmental management. The proposal is based on\ncountry-identified needs outlined in the National Environmental Management Strategies (NEMS)\nto  incorporate  traditional  knowledge  and  practices  into  national  government  environmental\nmanagement systems. Accordingly, the ADB fielded Fact-Finding Mission visited the  Cook\nIslands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (the RMI), and Vanuatu from 8 to 28 February\n2000. Three countries were selected to represent the three subregions of Melanesia (Vanuatu),\nMicronesia (the RMI), and Polynesia (the Cook Islands). SPREP was visited in Samoa to\ndiscuss the regional technical assistance (TA). SPREP also participated in the Mission. The\nMission met with senior officials of concerned agencies, scientists, traditional environmental\nmanagement  groups,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  the  three  countries  to\ndiscuss the TA objective, scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements.1 While a\nnumber of initiatives are under way in the region for natural resource conservation, the member\ngovernments  of  SPREP  have  recognized  the  urgency  to  address  potential  environmental\nmanagement problems arising from the increasing pressures on natural resources. The three\nparticipating governments endorsed the TA as an essential activity to fill a potential weakness in\nenvironmental management and conservation programs. The TA Framework is attached as\nAppendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The PDMCs include many small-island nations with vast geographical, ecological, and\nsociocultural diversity. A fragile ecosystem and a limited resource base have caused them to\nshare a strong affinity with, and dependence on, land and ocean resources for their livelihood\nand economic development. The traditional way of life has been, of necessity, an ecologically\nsustainable one, with care of the environment essential for future generations to benefit from the\nresources. However, the introduction of a cash economy and the need to satisfy increasing\nfinancial demands have led to increasing pressures on natural resources, and in some areas,\nincreasing environmental degradation.\n3. Environmental degradation is now becoming more visible in the PDMCs. Increasing\npopulation  levels  are  intensifying  pressures  on natural  resource use  and  rapidly  changing\nlifestyles are generating nonbiological wastes such as aluminum cans, plastics, and abandoned\nvehicles. While many of the reef ecosystems are relatively undisturbed, others are threatened\nby coral harvesting and destructive fishing methods used to supply the aquarium and food-fish\nmarkets. These problems are now worsening and may affect sustainable development not only\nin the PDMCs, but also in the entire region. Such problems are occurring partly because of the\ndeclining role of traditional leaders in the decision-making process for resource management. In\naddition, while life skills, agriculture, and other more practical subjects are taught, they are\ngenerally based on the latest technological findings with inadequate emphasis on the use of\ntraditional, ecologically sustainable techniques.\n                                               \n1  The TA is included in the 2000 regional TA Program. It first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet\nedition) on 26 January 2000.", "2\n4.  Indeed, awareness and understanding of the importance of traditional practices that\nhave been a part of past generations are now disappearing due to recent sociocultural changes\nand  modern  influences.  Hence,  it  is  necessary  to  promote  traditional  environmental\nmanagement  by  encouraging  the  incorporation  of  environmentally  sustainable  traditional\npractices with nontraditional practices. This can be done through focused educational programs\nat both the formal and nonformal levels, while promoting a greater role for traditional leaders in\nenvironmental  management  activities.  Information  on  traditional  practices,  collected  under\nprevious and ongoing activities, will be incorporated into formal education curricula, and will be\nused to produce materials for nonformal education and awareness-raising campaigns (e.g.,\nbooklets, videos, posters, and CD-ROMs).\n5. Information sharing by countries in the region enables dissemination of knowledge and\nexperiences. Therefore, the regional information network must be strengthened to support the\ntransfer  of  knowledge  and  information.  The  PDMCs  can  benefit  from  the  globalization  of\ninformation by using standard information transfer systems and Internet-based technologies.\nInternet-based  technologies  can  minimize  the  impacts  that  geographical  isolation  has  on\ninformation access, and elevate the level of awareness of Pacific island countries on a regional\nand global basis.\n6. Traditional environmental management is one of the priority areas for implementation in\nthe NEMS. The NEMS were prepared between 1992 and 1993 for five PDMCs under the ADB\nTA,2 Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, RMI, Solomon Islands, and Tonga.3 Many\nof the programs listed in the NEMS have been implemented. In addition, during the past seven\nyears, there have been adjustments in policies and legislation, and changes in environmental\nconditions. The governments of the Cook Islands and the RMI have expressed their keen\ninterest  in  reviewing the  NEMS  implementation, particularly  programs  related  to  traditional\nenvironmental management, and to draw on the lessons learned.\n7. There are related programs that have been undertaken and/or are still ongoing in the\nPacific region, most prominent of which are ADB TA No. 5403 (see footnote 2), Australian\nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)/SPREP  Environmental  Education  and\nAwareness Project,4 and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) support program for\nCapacity Building for Environmental Management in the Pacific (CBEMP).5 Under the CBEMP\nprogram, Vanuatu completed a collection and review of information on traditional environmental\nmanagement practices. This information is now being collated into a report that is due for\ncompletion in April 2000. The implementation of activities in Vanuatu has not commenced due\nto limited funding available under the CBEMP. In the RMI, no activities have commenced to\ndate. However, the Historic Preservation Office and Alele Museum have been jointly gathering\ninformation on various legends, folklore, and traditional practices and knowledge under the\nGovernment program. This existing information can be used for the TA. The Cook Islands is not\na participant in the CBEMP. Several organizations, including the Natural Heritage Trust, Ministry\n                                               \n2   TA 5403-REG: Strengthening Environmental Management Capabilities in Pacific Island Developing Countries, for\n$900,000, approved on 24 August 1990. The TA has successfully prepared the State of the Environment and the\nNEMS for the five participating countries. SPREP was the Executing Agency.\n3  In tandem with this TA, UNDP also provided similar TA for seven Pacific island countries including Kiribati, Nauru,\nNiue, Palau, Samoa, Tokelau, and Tuvalu.\n4  The project was implemented from 1995 to 1997 and included Cook Islands, Kiribati, RMI, Samoa, Solomon\nIslands, and Vanuatu.\n5  The program (1998-2001) has the objective to increase the capacity of the Pacific island countries to sustainably\nuse their natural resources to maximize their economic and social returns while maintaining the resources for\nfuture generations. Beneficiary countries include Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, RMI, Nauru,\nNiue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The program is implemented by SPREP.", "3\nfor Marine Resources, Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Secretariat of the Pacific\nCommunity  (SPC)  Fisheries  Program  have  collected  relevant  traditional  information.\nFurthermore, the Cook Islands recognizes the importance of traditional knowledge and has\ninstigated efforts to be developed through the TA. Discussions were undertaken with UNDP (in\nApia, Samoa) to jointly cooperate in strengthening the capacity of Pacific island countries in\nenvironmental management, using the CBEMP\u2019s outcome and other information collected from\nvarious sources. The current TA will use the collected information on traditional environmental\nmanagement practices, knowledge, and values for incorporation into formal and nonformal\neducation materials; compile best-practice case studies; and develop a project implementation\nmanual  and/or  guidelines,  and  training  modules  incorporating  traditional  environmental\nmanagement practices.\n8. The current TA will be executed by SPREP. Established in 1982, SPREP is a regional\norganization  established  by  the  governments  and  administrations  of  the  Pacific  region.  It\npromotes  cooperation  in  the South  Pacific  region  and  provides  assistance  to  protect  and\nimprove  the  environment,  and  to  ensure  sustainable  development  for  present  and  future\ngenerations. It serves as the conduit for concerted action in this area at the regional level. Under\na  broader  perspective,  SPREP  develops  and  implements  a  regionally  coordinated  and\ncomprehensive range of activities under the following programs: (i) Biodiversity and Natural\nResource Conservation, (ii) Climate Change and Integrated Coastal Management, (iii) Waste\nManagement,  Pollution  Prevention,  and  Emergencies,  (iv)  Environmental  Management,\nPlanning, and Institutional Strengthening, and (v) Environmental Education, Information, and\nTraining. The programs most closely related to the current TA are Environmental Management,\nPlanning,  and  Institutional  Strengthening;  and  Environmental  Education,  Information,  and\nTraining. SPREP, as in the past, currently implements various programs and projects financed\nby multilateral and bilateral aid institutions.6\nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n9. The objective of the TA is to help the PDMCs to sustainably use their natural resources\nby  promoting the  use of  traditional  environmental  management  practices,  knowledge,  and\nvalues.\nB.

The TA\nwill  review  implementation  of  the  NEMS  and  lessons  learned,  particularly  on  components\nrelated to traditional environmental management practices.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $300,000 equivalent.\nThe TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund funded by the\nGovernment of Japan. SPREP has agreed to provide the following in-kind support: (i) counterpart\nprofessional staff inputs, including management hours, the TA manager and additional technical\nstaff inputs;7 (ii) travel costs for SPREP staff; (iii) partial report and communication costs; (iv) partial\ntraining and workshop costs; (v) office accommodations; and (vi) secretarial services estimated at\n$190,000 equivalent. SPREP will also provide the consultants with communication access and\nother office facilities. The participating PDMC governments will provide $60,000 (in-kind). Detailed\ncost estimates are presented in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n12. The Executing Agency will be SPREP. ADB\u2019s Environment Division will be responsible\nfor processing and  supervising  TA  implementation. SPREP  will  assign  a  suitably qualified\ncounterpart staff member to serve as the TA manager responsible for overall management and\nimplementation of the TA. The manager will be responsible for liaison with SPREP\u2019s national\nfocal  points  and  key  agencies  appointed  by  the  participating  PDMC  governments\n(Environmental Services, the Cook Islands; Environmental Protection Agency, the RMI; and\nVanuatu  Cultural  Center,  Vanuatu),  and  other  regional  organizations  in  achieving  the  TA\nobjective. Under the overall supervision of the head of the Environmental Education, Information\nand Capacity-Building Division, the TA manager will work in close collaboration with SPREP\u2019s\nCBEMP officer, information technology officer, training officer and information and publications\nofficer to ensure continued commitment to the TA. The TA manager will be assisted by an\nenvironmental education assistant recruited for day-to-day TA implementation.\n13. The implementation procedure will be jointly developed by SPREP and the government\nagencies through consultative workshops in each participating country during the inception\nphase, and electronic data transfer mechanisms. The TA manager, national focal points, and\nkey  agencies  will  communicate  regularly  to  keep  track  of  the  TA\u2019s  progress  during\nimplementation to ensure that the objectives are achieved. These will include regular travels by\nthe TA manager to the countries concerned using SPREP funding. A two-month internship-cum-\ntraining program on developing educational materials and Internet-based information and data\ntransfer will also be undertaken at SPREP. The participants will be the personnel of, and\nappointed by, the participating PDMC governments. Upon completion of the program, they will\nassist  the  TA  manager  in  implementing  the  TA  in  their  respective  countries  under  the\nsupervision of the national focal points and key government agencies.\n14. A team of international, and regional and/or domestic consultants financed by the TA will\nsupport SPREP during TA implementation. The international consultant will be an environmental\nmanagement  specialist  experienced  in  resource  management  and  educational/awareness-\nraising program development preferably in the PDMCs (three person-months). The regional\n                                               \n7  Additional technical staff inputs include the: CBEMP officer, information technology staff, training officer and\ninformation and publications officer.", "5\nand/or domestic consultants will include an information technology specialist experienced in\ndeveloping Internet-based information systems and CD-ROMs (two person-months), and an\neducation specialist experienced in educational materials preparation and having knowledge on\nsocial  science  (three  person-months).  Resource  persons  will  be  recruited  during  TA\nimplementation  in  accordance  with  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  international  and\nregional and/or domestic consultants will assist SPREP by providing specific advice and skills\nfor  overall  implementation  of  the  TA  Program,  such  as  preparing  strategic  plans  for  TA\nimplementation,  reviewing  the  NEMS,  and  conducting  training  for  the  personnel  from  the\nparticipating PDMC governments (outline of the terms of reference are in Appendix 3). The\nconsultants  will  work  under  the  guidance  of  the  TA  manager.  They  will  be  selected  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  and  other  arrangements\nacceptable to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. Equipment will be procured\nunder ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n15. The TA will be executed over 18 months, commencing in May 2000 and ending in\nNovember 2001. SPREP will implement the TA in consultation with ADB. Several workshops\nwill be conducted during implementation, i.e., (i) inception workshops, (ii) curriculum writing\nworkshops, (iii) training workshops for teachers on the use of the educational materials, (iv)\nawareness-raising programs for communities and NGOs, (v) training workshops for government\nofficials, and (vi) a regional workshop at the end of TA implementation.\n16. ADB\u2019s South Pacific Resident Mission in Vanuatu will be encouraged to participate in the\nin-country and regional workshops and other related activities, and generate awareness on the\ninformation systems to be developed under the TA. ADB will regularly monitor and review the\nimplementation progress through (i) quarterly progress reports and (ii) at least three review\nmissions particularly to evaluate the inception, interim and draft final reports of the study.\nSPREP will be responsible for overall quality control to ensure that the environmental education\nmaterials and  manual/guidelines  (to  be used by  decision  makers)  meet  the  needs  of  the\nPDMCs. The regional information network using the Internet-based system to be developed at\nSPREP, and government web sites, will be maintained.\n17. SPREP  will  provide  the  following  reports  to  ADB:  (i)  inception  report  covering  the\nmobilization of consultants, detailed work plan, and preliminary outcome of the works; it will be\ndiscussed in a tripartite meeting; (ii) quarterly progress reports of TA implementation; (iii) interim\nreport summarizing the progress and outlining the ongoing works, to be discussed in a tripartite\nmeeting in February 2001; (iv) draft final report covering the overall works achieved, to be\nsubmitted one month before the termination of the TA and discussed in the final tripartite review\nmeeting  in  October  2001;  and  (v)  final  report  incorporating  comments  from  the  PDMC\ngovernments, SPREP, and ADB, to be submitted within three weeks after the final tripartite\nreview.\nIV.

Introduction\n1. The scope of work of the regional technical assistance (TA) include (i) incorporating\ninformation on traditional environmental management practices and values into existing formal\nand nonformal education programs to ensure that such information is not lost and is better\nrecognized  in  today\u2019s  society;  disseminating  information  to  decision  makers,  government\npersonnel,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  the  general  community  on  the\nimportance of preserving and using traditional knowledge, alongside new technical knowledge\nand practices; (ii) promoting the role of traditional leaders in environmental management; and\n(iii) strengthening the regional information network for the transfer of knowledge and skills using\nstandard  information  transfer  systems  and  Internet-based  technologies.  In  line  with  these\nactivities, the TA will review the implementation of the National Environmental Management\nStrategies (NEMS) and lessons learned, particularly for components related to the traditional\nenvironmental management practices. Three countries (the Cook Islands, the Republic of the\nMarshall Islands (the RMI), and Vanuatu) will be involved in the TA. The TA will be executed\nover 18 months, commencing in May 2000 and ending in November 2001.\n2. SPREP will assign and finance a suitably qualified staff member to serve as the TA\nmanager. The SPREP team (TA manager and one environmental education assistant) will be\nresponsible for carrying out day-to-day activities and overall coordination under the general\nguidance of the SPREP\u2019s head of Environmental Education, Information, and Capacity-building\nDivision. In undertaking such tasks, the TA manager will liaise with SPREP\u2019s Capacity Building\nfor Environmental Management in the Pacific (CBEMP)9 officer, information technology staff,\ntraining officer and information and publications officer. The international and regional and/or\ndomestic consultants financed by the ADB grant will support the SPREP team (eight person-\nmonths).  The  international  consultant  will  be  an  environmental  management  specialist\nexperienced  in  resource  management  and  educational/awareness-raising  program\ndevelopment, preferably in the Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) (three person-\nmonths).  The  regional  and/or  domestic  consultants  will  include  an  information  technology\nspecialist experienced in developing Internet-based information systems and CD-ROMs (two\nperson-months), and an education specialist experienced in educational materials preparation\nand having knowledge on social science (three person-months).

They will also carry out an internship-cum-\ntraining program for the three government officials at the SPREP Office and will assist SPREP\nby providing specific advice and skills for the implementation of the TA Program. Resource\npersons will be recruited during TA implementation to assist in the workshops and related\nactivities.\n2. Country Consultation\n6. During  the  two-month  inception  phase,  the  SPREP  team,  CBEMP  officer,  and\ninternational consultant (environmental management specialist), in consultation with multilateral\nand bilateral aid institutions providing assistance in related fields in the region, will organize a\none-day  inception  (consultative/planning)  workshop  in  each  participating  PDMC.  Workshop\nparticipants will include representatives from concerned government agencies, institutions, NGOs,\nand other stakeholders. These in-country workshops are tentatively scheduled for June 2000.\nThe workshop\u2019s objectives are to: (i) prepare the TA work plan; (ii) establish coordination and\nnetworking  among  concerned  agencies,  institutions,  NGOs,  and  other  interested  parties;  (iii)\nassess  data  expected  to be  collected, and  currently available from previous  and  ongoing\nactivities on traditional environmental management, practices, and values, and define data sets\nnecessary for the TA; (iv) define expected outputs; (v) set up an overall TA implementation plan;\nand  (iv)  prepare  an  internship-cum-training  program  for  the  government  representatives\nidentified in consultation with the participating PDMC governments.\n3. Inception Report\n7. An inception report will be prepared, taking into consideration the recommendations from\nthe country consultative and planning workshops. The work plan will include strategic plans for\nTA  implementation,  processing  schedule,  activities,  allocation  of  consultants\u2019  time  and\nresources for the works to be carried out and their coordination, expected outputs, and other\nrelated matters, as necessary.\nC. Implementation\n8. Following  the  inception  phase,  implementation  of  the  terms  of  reference  will  be\nundertaken by SPREP. The consultants will be mobilized to assist SPREP in areas requiring\nspecific assistance. A two-month internship-cum-training program will be undertaken at SPREP\nfor the government representative of each of the three participating PDMCs. The trainees will\nwork together with SPREP\u2019s education officer, CBEMP officer, information technology staff,\ntraining  officer  and  information  and  publications  officer.  The  training  will  focus  on  the  (i)\nincorporation of traditional environmental management practices  into formal and  nonformal\neducation materials, and (ii) use of information technology in disseminating the TA outcome.\nOne set of hardware and software will be provided for each of the participating PDMCs.", "11\nAppendix 3, page 3\n9. During TA implementation, SPREP\u2019s education officer and CBEMP officer will visit the\nthree participating countries (at least three visits per country) to consult with relevant agencies,\ninstitutions, NGOs, and other stakeholders as necessary; and to ensure that continued TA\nimplementation remains efficient.\n10. A regional workshop involving the PDMC government representatives will be undertaken\nduring the final TA implementation phase to consolidate TA findings and strengthen regional\ncooperation and information-sharing. The final report, in hard copy and in CD-ROM, will present\nthe overall outcome of activities under the TA, as detailed in the terms of reference.\n11. The core activities under the TA will include the following tasks.\n1. Educational Materials/Manual Production and Training\n12. Activities include the following:\n(i) Compile  and  review  information  on  traditional  environmental  management\npractices collected under previous activities such as the CBEMP, and by other\ninstitutions (e.g., The Historic Preservation Office and Alele Museum of the RMI,\nWorldwide Fund for Nature, and National Heritage Trust of the Cook Islands).\nIncorporate good practices and values into (a) existing formal and nonformal\neducation materials (e.g., booklets, posters, and CD-ROMs), and (b)  project\nimplementation  manual  and/or  guidelines  for  the  government  agencies\nresponsible for  resource  management.  In  cases  where  such  manual  and/or\nguidelines do not currently exist, develop such manual or best-practice case\nstudies to improve project implementation/management.\n(ii) Hold a resource material development workshop in each country in consultation\nwith educational ministries, curriculum development units, and NGOs to produce\nsuitable materials for school use and other educational programs. Identify one\nperson from each workshop to follow an internship-cum-training program on the\nproduction of the national educational materials under the guidance of SPREP\u2019s\ninformation and publications officer, and develop the web site containing selected\nmaterials and maintain the databases.\n(iii) Using the educational materials produced under the TA, conduct (a) training of\nteachers on the use of educational materials; (b) training workshops for decision\nmakers and other key government personnel  directly  responsible for  natural\nresource  management  on  the  importance  of  using  traditional  knowledge\nalongisde  new  technology,  and  scientific  information  and  practices;  and  (c)\nawareness-raising  training  for  communities  and  NGOs  in  the  participating\nPDMCs.\n(iv)  At the final phase of TA implementation, undertake a regional workshop involving\nthe PDMCs to discuss the TA outcome, focusing on the (a) implementation of\nactivities under the scope of the TA, (b) implementation of sound policies and\nmanagement  plans for natural  resource  management; and  (c)  strengthening\nregional cooperation among the PDMC governments on such activities.", "Appendix 3, page 4\n12\n2. Promoting the Role of Traditional Leaders\n13. Compile information and assess the past and present roles of traditional leaders in\nenvironmental management, and the extent of public participation in the resource management\ndecision-making  process.  Identify  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  present  systems,  and\nrecommend ways to improve the role of traditional leaders in environmental management within\nthe existing government systems. Discuss the recommendations in the regional workshop to\nobtain views and support from the government representatives.\n3. Strengthening the Information Network\n14. Using  the  information  compiled under  task 1(i),  strengthen the  regional  information\nnetwork for disseminating information using the standard information  transfer  systems and\nInternet-based technologies. In so doing, establish a web page on traditional environmental\nmanagement within the existing SPREP web site and, wherever possible, on each  of  the\nparticipating  PDMCs\u2019  web  sites.  The  web  page  will  contain  a  summary  of  traditional\nenvironmental  management  knowledge,  practices,  and  values;  information  on  integrating\ntraditional and modern practices to achieve better project implementation; and selected case\nstudies.\n4. Review of the NEMS Implementation\n15. Review the NEMS implementation under ADB\u2019s previous TA (for the Cook Islands and\nthe  RMI)  particularly  programs/projects  that  are  closely  related  to  the  use  of  traditional\nenvironmental management. Make a critical analysis of the successes and failures of past\nefforts and lessons learned. Identify issues that need attention and those that have not been\naddressed properly (e.g., policies, legislation, and community consultation and participation).\nProvide suggestions for new programs, particularly those related to traditional environmental\nmanagement."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20000609141322", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Creator": "PSCRIPT.DRV Version 4.0", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R120-00cover.doc", "ModDate": "D:20010820153317+08'00'"}}
