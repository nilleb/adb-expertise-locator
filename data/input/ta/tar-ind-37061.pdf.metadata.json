The Government of India requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA)1 to help selected state governments in India reform their civil service \npensions by reviewing options for addressing the fiscal implications of the growing pension \nburden  of  the  respective  state  government,  and  considering  policy  and  downstream \nmodifications  in  the  existing  pension  schemes.  Accordingly,  a  TA  grant  in  the  amount  of \n$750,000 was included for the above project in the country strategy and program to India for \n2004. The TA is part of ADB\u2019s strategic intervention to improve public resource management \nand  develop  India\u2019s  domestic  capital  market,  which  is  critical  to  moving  the  infrastructure \nagenda forward and financing India\u2019s economic growth. A TA Fact-Finding Mission visited India \nfrom 12 to 14 May 2004 to discuss the possible scope of assistance and implementation \nrequirements with the Department of Economic Affairs\u2019 (DEA) Capital Markets Division, Ministry \nof Finance (MOF), and other key stakeholders concerned with the reform of India\u2019s pension \nsystem. This report reflects the findings of the Mission and the understanding reached with the \nGovernment regarding the TA objectives, scope, cost, implementation arrangements, and terms \nof reference.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Fiscal stress emanating from the increasing pension liabilities of the central and state \ngovernment employees in India has emerged as a major area of concern, and is reflected by the \nfollowing facts:  \n \n(i)  The central Government's pension liability has increased from 0.6% of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 1993\u20131994 to 1.66% in 2002\u20132003, with pensioners-\nto-employees\u2019 ratio at 0.85. \n(ii)  For the state government, the annual average increase in pension expenditure in \nthe period 1995\u20131996 to 2000\u20132001 was 27.1%.  \n(iii)  Of  the  revenue  receipts  of  the  states,  10%  was  preempted  by  pension \nexpenditure. \n \n3.  The aggregate pension payments of state governments increased significantly from \nRs31.31 billion in 1990\u20131991 to Rs78.13 billion in 1995\u20131996 and further to Rs281.97 billion in \n2001\u20132002. The ratio of states\u2019 pension payments to their revenue expenditure had grown from \n4.4% in 1990\u20131991 to around 9% by 2001\u20132002. Similarly, the share of state pension payments \nto their revenue receipts witnessed a sharp rise from 4.7% (Supplementary Appendix 1). \n \n4.  As  per  the  Report  of  the  Group  to  Study  the  Pension  Liabilities  of  the  State \nGovernments, October 2003, the steep increase in states' pension outgo is mainly due to the \nsignificant expansion in the number of state government employees during the earlier decades; \nextension of pension facilities to employees of various non-Government institutions (grant-in-aid \ninstitutions, local bodies, etc.); impact of various pay revisions; implementation of the central \nGovernment's decision on recommendations of fifth central pay commission by the states (with \nor  without  any  modifications);  periodic  dearness  allowance  increases;  and  significant \nimprovement in life expectancy.2  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 September 2004. \n2 Source: Report of the Group to Study the Pension Liabilities of the State Governments, October 2003. B. K. \nBhattacharya, Chief Secretary (Retd.), government of Karnataka, chaired the Group. ", "2 \n5.  A major policy initiative in the direction of civil service pension reforms at the center is \nthe Government's decision of 23 August 2003 to replace the existing, unfunded defined benefit \n(DB) pension scheme with a fully funded defined contribution (DC) scheme for new entrants to \ncentral Government service that will exclude the armed forces. The scheme envisages three \nfunds, i.e., safe income, balanced, and growth with safe income as a default option. The new \nsystem  will  also  be  available  on  a  voluntary  basis  to  all  persons  including  self-employed \nprofessionals and others in the organized sectors. The Government is also considering possible \noptions for devising voluntary privately managed pension schemes that could be offered to all \neligible participants from the unorganized, or informal, sector of the Indian economy.3 DEA is \ncurrently engaged in establishing the legislative, regulatory, and institutional framework for the \nnew  pension  system  (NPS),  and  the  bill  for  legislating  the  Pension  Fund  Regulatory  and \nDevelopment Authority (PFRDA) is likely to be introduced in the coming winter session of \nParliament.  \n \n6.  In  parallel,  the  growing  pension  liabilities  of  various  state  governments  have  been \nclamoring for increased attention, particularly from the policy makers, because of the fiscal \ndeterioration of state finances. The road map for future pension reforms was laid down in the \nreport of the High-Level Committees on Pension Reforms, one constituted by MOF and the \nother by Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Both committees recommended changing from a DB \nscheme to a DC scheme. The RBI Committee, which deliberated at length on the pension \nliabilities of the states, indicated that pension payments would preempt 30% of the states\u2019 own \nrevenues and 20% of their total receipts by 2010\u20132011. It recommended three alternatives for \nstructural change, including the introduction of a new scheme based on DC at the state level. \n \n7.  Almost all states are increasingly concerned about the sustainability of their existing \npension schemes and their fiscal implications, and are inclined to introduce reforms. In principle, \nthe options in front of the states are to (i) offer NPS to their new employees, and (ii) consider for \nits existing employees a variety of systematic and parametric reforms that could be either \nvoluntary or mandatory. A number of states are in favor of introducing a contributory pension \nscheme for newly recruited employees. Several state governments have voluntarily decided to \nadopt the NPS for their own new employees. These include Tamil Nadu (April 2003), Himachal \nPradesh  (May  2003),  Rajasthan  (January  2004),  and  Andhra  Pradesh  (September  2004). \nSeveral others have announced their intent to move in this direction. These include Assam, \nGoa, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Punjab. It is clear that the momentum already exists. \nMany other states are expected to follow suit.  \n \n8.  Almost all state governments lack proper arrangements to collect and monitor data \nrelating to pensioners. To accurately quantify the financial impact (expenditure and/or savings) \nfrom the reforms, the state governments will require good-quality demographic, income, and \nemployment data on their existing employees. Correct estimates would require an age profile of \nboth in-service employees and pensioners, distribution of pensioners over service categories, \ndistribution based on last pay drawn, and regular revision of data to reflect changes on account \nof  death.  These  problems  can  be  addressed  with  professional  advice  from  actuaries  and \ninformation technology experts. It is, therefore, important that state governments put in place \nappropriate mechanisms to strengthen their existing database on employees and pensioners \nand periodically update and verify such data. This data will also be necessary to accurately \ncalculate the cost of government inaction on pension reform (in the form of pension liabilities \nand expenditure) over multiple decades. In addition to data collation and liability assessment, it \nwill  be  essential  to  build  capacity  and  knowledge  on  pension  system  design,  and  policy \nalternatives on reform and implementation issues among senior policy makers in each state. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for the Unorganized Sector. Manila (TA 4226-IND, for $1,000,000). \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will assist selected state governments in India in the measurement and reform of \ntheir civil service pensions. The core steps in achieving pension reforms for state governments \nwill include (i) estimating liability, (ii) deciding on the reform option to implement, (iii) setting up \nthe  requisite  systems  and  procedures  relating  to  the  proposed  pension  system,  and  (iv) \ndeveloping capacity and education for implementing the reform proposals. The TA will help the \nselected states (i) compile information on the full set of employee benefits offered by the \ngovernment  along  with  related  expenditure  and  income  information  on  the  state  in  a \nstandardized format; (ii) collate accurate demographic, income and other relevant information \nand  data  on  existing  state  government  employees,  pensioners,  and  dependents,  and \nestablishing responsibilities, procedures and processes for regularly capturing and compiling \nsuch data in a standard format; (iii) build a liability estimation tool kit for analyzing the fiscal and \nfinancial impact of a variety of reform proposals for each selected state; (iv) produce suitable \nparametric  and/or  systemic  reform  proposals  and    evaluate  the  merits,  implementation \nprocesses, and fiscal impact of parametric and/or systemic changes to retirement benefits for \nvarious  categories  of existing  employees  and  pensioners;  (v)  conduct  a sample  survey  to \nassess  the  attitudes  of  existing  government  employees  and  pensioners  toward  alternative \npension benefit structures; (vi) the selected state governments build suitable capacity  and \nprocesses to harness existing reform initiatives announced under the NPS for new entrants to \ncentral Government service; and (vii) evaluate the merits, processes, and financial impact of \noutsourcing of services and transferring the risks and liabilities (payout of benefits, etc.) of \ngovernment pension payments so as to reduce administrative costs and risks. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will therefore be broadly divided into the following three components: (i) data \ngathering,  development  of  liability  assessment  tools,  and  liability  assessment;  (ii)  policy \nproposals  for  consideration  by  each  state  government;  and  (iii)  coordination  between  the \nvarious ministries and departments in each state, and also between the states and the central \nGovernment;  and  capacity-building  efforts  for  implementing  the  reform.  To  have  maximum \nimpact,  the  Government  proposes  to  initially  cover  about  10\u201312  states.  The  Government \nproposes to allocate those states that are ready between the World Bank and ADB. In addition \nto its focal states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, the World \nBank has also been allotted the states of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. ADB is likely to be \nallotted the states of Assam, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh (3 of its focal states), Bihar, Goa, and \nOrissa. The World Bank proposes to use its tool kit called Pension Reform Options Simulation \nand  Toolkit  (PROST).  PROST  is  expected  to  help  arrive  at  correct  estimates  of  pension \nliabilities over the long run, as forecasting facilitates the formation of alternative solutions. The \nADB TA will also examine the feasibility of using alternate models for liability estimation or have \na suitable liability estimation tool developed under the TA. However, it will be ensured that a \nstandardized approach is followed for data compilation in all the selected states. \n \n11.  For  capacity  building and  project  coordination,  it  is  proposed  that there  be  a  focal \ncoordination  unit  at  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  at  the  center,  with  the  necessary  project \nmanagement capacity. In addition, the TA will provide local counterpart arrangements with the \nrelevant state governments to coordinate locally the database and capacity-building activities \nwith the relevant officials of each state government. The EA will closely liaise with the state \ngovernments and ADB on a variety of tasks. Details of related activities are in Appendix 1 items \n ", "4 \n(xii) to (xviii). The reports and research generated in the study will become an input for overall \npension reforms and will be the backbone for the final recommendations from this initiative. \n \n12.  For each selected state, a broad capacity-building exercise on pension reforms will be \nundertaken.  The  exercise  will  target  key  officials  at  each  state  and  will  facilitate  an \nunderstanding of the global and domestic experience with civil service pension reform; the core \nconcepts and principles of pension system design and implementation; clarity on policy options \nbefore  the  relevant  governments  and  government  departments;  a  detailed  insight  into  the \nexisting reform initiatives in India  (e.g., the NPS) and the road map through which states can \nharness  these  reform  initiatives;  and  specific,  immediate  actions  that  the  states  should \nundertake.  \n \n13.  The TA will also assist in setting up a secure web site for the project\u2014all research, data \ninputs, and related information on the project would be hosted on this web site for access by the \nTA project team, the EA, selected states, and ADB. The study will become a nucleus for existing \nexpertise in this area and will assist in building sustained capacity by affiliating and collaborating \nwith a number of agencies and individuals across the states, as well as global pension experts \nand in channeling their knowledge and experience into implementation of the efforts under this \nproject. \n \n15.  A  1-week  study  tour  will  be  prepared  for  12\u201315  officials  from  the  selected  state \ngovernments and the MOF to visit and discuss with organizations in more developed economies \nexperience  with  reforming  and  managing  civil  service  pensions,  and  the  requirements  for \nsuccessfully managing service agreements with private sector service providers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent of which $445,000 will be \nin foreign currency, and $555,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance $750,000 \nequivalent, which includes the entire foreign currency costs and $305,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency costs. The remaining $250,000 equivalent will be contributed by the Government and \nwill cover office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, and other logistical support. \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MOF\u2019s  DEA  (Capital  Markets  Division)  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA  and  will  provide \nnecessary office space, counterpart support, and other services to the consultants. Each co-\nopted state will be the Implementing Agency for the TA. The international consultants will \nassociate with a local professional consulting firm with experts having the required experience in \npension  policy  and  system  design,  reform,  and  implementation.  In  coordination  with  the \ninternational consulting firm, the local firm will also be actively involved in overall local project \nmanagement including (i) coordinating of the various tasks and deliverables under the TA within \neach  state,  between  the  relevant  states,  as  well  as  between  the  states  and  the  central \nGovernment; (ii) assisting each state in adopting of the NPS; and (iii) building broad-based \ncapacity and a policy consensus within each state. The TA will also engage a local specialized, \nprofessional agency to be subcontracted by the principal consulting firm for the task of data \ncollection and assessment and with a network of data specialists, statisticians, and social sector \nresearch experts that will be engaged. Data gathering and processing are expected to be \ncompleted within 9\u201312 months. International consultants (11 person-months total) will comprise \na  pension  policy  and  system  expert  (team  leader),  an  actuary,  and  an  information  and \n ", "  5\ntechnology  expert.  Domestic  consultants  (15  person-months  total)  will  comprise  a  pension \npolicy and system expert, an actuary, an information and technology expert, a financial expert, \nand a legal/regulatory expert. The international consulting firm will be recruited, using simplified \ntechnical proposals under the quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The consulting firm will submit to the EA and ADB a work plan for the TA within 2 weeks \nof  the  start  of  its  services  in  the  field.  The  work  plan  will  include  the  planned  activities, \nmethodologies, and output of the TA. The start of services will allow for a proper interface with \nthe local data firm before finalization of the data-gathering exercise and related report. The \nconsulting firm will submit an inception report within 4 weeks of the start of its services in the \nfield. After securing agreement, the local data firm will assist the selected states to gather data \n(by defining standard data formats), conduct training for the relevant state government staff, \nefficiently collate and process the data, and make it available to the pension reform team for \nanalysis. At the end of 4 months, the data firm will submit a preliminary report of its findings for \nthe data-gathering exercise to the EA, the international and domestic consulting firms, and ADB. \nAny adjustments or additional information and data and clarifications that may be required will \nbe communicated at this point to the data firm. On completion of the data collection and \nprocessing and related tasks, and 2 weeks before the termination of services of the data firm, a \nworkshop will be held with various stakeholders and representatives from the EA, selected \nstates, the consulting firm, and ADB to present the findings of data gathering for the actuarial \nexperts to conduct specific research and an impact measurement exercise, which will be an \ninput in the final recommendations.  The consulting firm in parallel will (i) develop the liability \nestimation tool kit, (ii) assist the states to evaluate and implement suitable processes and \npolicies for adopting the NPS, and (iii) educate and prepare the state for pension reforms. The \nprocessed data once available will be analyzed and researched by the consulting firm as \nmentioned above. The capacity-building exercise (paras. 12 and 13) will also be simultaneously \nundertaken.  \n \n19.  Two interim reports will be submitted: at the end of month 6 and month 12, respectively. \nThe study tour (para. 15) will be undertaken after the submission of the second interim report. \nThe  findings  of  the  study  tour  will  form  part  of  the  draft  final  report.  A  workshop  for \nrepresentatives from the EA, the selected state governments, other stakeholders, PFRDA, and \nADB will be held to discuss the outputs of the local data firm and the liability estimation tool to \nbe  used  for  impact  measurement.  In  coordination  with  the  EA,  an  NPS  manual  will  be \ndeveloped to serve as a reference for the states on the specific steps to be undertaken by each \nstate once it decides to introduce the NPS. A draft final report will be submitted to form the basis \nfor discussions in a tripartite meeting among the EA, the consulting firm, and ADB, to be held 2 \nweeks before the finalization of the report. The meeting will consider the results of the actuarial \nstudies and the implementation plan of the pension program. The TA is planned to start by end- \nMarch 2005 and be completed by September 2006. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in  Sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty analysis?  Yes  country poverty partnership agreement?  No  \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in India: \nThe  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  selected  state  governments  in  India  in  the \nmeasurement  and  reform  of  their  civil  service  pensions;  help  consider  the  feasibility  of \nintroducing necessary modifications in the existing pension schemes, and, in the process, \nsuggest appropriate mechanisms to address the fiscal implications of the growing pension \nburden for the respective state governments. The TA will provide a reliable and cost-effective \nmethod of old age support. The pension reforms will reduce the fiscal burden of the states and \nwill facilitate economic growth and efficiency in resource allocation. Important byproducts are \nincreased flow of long-term institutional savings and the boost to the overall development of the \nfinancial market. As pension funds are longterm in nature, their bulk could be invested in \ninfrastructure projects. The focus on infrastructure projects recognizes the contributions they \nmake to sustainable economic growth, and in turn, the contribution that economic growth can \nmake to poverty reduction. In India\u2019s case, a considerable number of potential contributors to \nthe proposed pension arrangements are located in the formal sector. This fact would increase \nthe rate of savings, which could lead to a higher rate of capital accumulation and economic \ngrowth, crucial for a developing country like India. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nThe shift to a defined contribution pension scheme will (i) help prevent poverty among the \nelderly, (ii) improve overall labor market mobility, (iii) facilitate economic growth, (iv) deepen \ncapital markets, and (v) lead to an increase in the national savings rate. It can create new \nopportunities for self-discipline in savings and can help increase investment in human capital \nand physical assets. It will improve the financial sustainability of the old age system and thus \nprovide  better  protection  for  the  old  in  the  long  run.  These  gains  could  generate  higher \neconomic growth rates, raising living standards for those not participating directly in the pension \nsystem. \nC.  Participation Process    Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?     Yes     No \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes     No \n \nThe TA will recommend suitable strategies for creating awareness of the new pension strategy \namong state government employees. The strategy will likely improve the returns on pension \nfunds.  \na.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe TA will assist in the reforms of the state government pensions covering all employees, \nincluding women. A number of aspects in pension reforms are extremely gender sensitive. An \nequal retirement age will enable men and women to build up the same pension entitlements. A \n ", "    Appendix 3  13 \nsurvivor's pension could reduce the vulnerability of the dependent spouse considerably. The \nintroduction of credit periods for raising children and/or taking care of the elderly, responsibilities \nthat are mainly taken up by women, could allow them to build up more complete pension \nentitlements. These possible pension reforms will effectively reduce the vulnerability of future \npensioners and would, as such, be considered among the policy proposals. Consideration of \nthese reform options requires gender-disaggregated figures to estimate possible future costs. \nThe TA will consider policy reform for promoting gender equality and the collection of gender \ndisaggregated figures. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
