The  Project  will  also  help \nestablish  a  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  environment \nconducive  to  meeting  the  housing  needs  of  the  urban  poor  in \ninformal settlements. \n   \nClassification  Poverty Intervention \nThematic: Human Development \n   \nEnvironmental  Category B  \nAssessment  Initial  environmental  examinations  of  representative  core \nsubprojects indicated that the Project will have mostly beneficial \neffects, and that adverse effects can be mitigated. \n   \nRationale  The  Philippines  continues  to  urbanize  rapidly.  Over  half  of  the \npopulation is in urban areas, and this proportion is expected to \nreach 60% by 2010 if current trends continue. Housing and land \nmarkets  have  not  kept  pace  with  rapid  urban  growth  and, \nconsequently, shelter is not affordable for the poor: more than 40% \nof urban families live in makeshift dwellings in informal settlements. \nWhile official data indicate that only about 20% of the 7.5 million \nurban households fall below the poverty income line (P13,915 per \ncapita per year as of 2001), the poverty income line alone does not \ncapture the dire situation of informal settlers. The urban poor lack of \naccess  to  (i)  affordable,  tenured,  serviced  land;  (ii)  appropriate \nhousing;  (iii)  shelter  financing;  (iv)  targeted  and  sustainable \nsubsidies; and (v) means to provide their own shelter. All of these \nproblems require sustainable solutions. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The goal of the Project is to reduce income poverty and improve \nquality-of-life for the urban poor. The purpose of the Project is to put \nin place systems to provide affordable housing and serviced land \nfor the poor. In order to do this it will (i) improve the access of low-\nincome  urban  families  to  tenured,  serviced  plots  and  to \nopportunities for upgraded and new housing; (ii) provide appropriate ", "iv   \nfinance for shelter and other services; (iii) strengthen low-income \ncommunities  and  LGU  support  for  such  communities;  and  (iv) \nmobilize  communities  and  LGUs  to  participate  in  the  shelter \nprovision and finance parts of the Project. This will be achieved \nthrough three Project components. In part A, DBP will relend to \nqualified LGUs for site development. About 20,000 households will \ngain access to land tenure with basic infrastructure and services. In \npart B, DBP will establish shelter financing and microcredit facilities \nfor the potential beneficiaries, to support financing for (i) serviced \nplots and house improvements, (ii) new housing loans, and (iii) \nmicroenterprise credit facilities. In part C, DBP and HUDCC will \nundertake  capacity  building  and  project  implementation  support \nprograms  for  communities  and  LGUs  to  strengthen  the \ndecentralized shelter delivery mechanism. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project is expected to cost $48.8 million equivalent, comprising \n$34.3 million equivalent (70%) in local currency and $14.5 million \n(30%) in foreign currency.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent\nExchange Currency \nAsian Development Bank  10.2  20.3  30.5  62.5\nGrant Cofinancing    0.5  0.8  1.3  2.7\nConcessional Cofinancing  3.8  1.2  5.0  10.3\nNational Government  0.0  3.5  3.5  7.2\nDevelopment Bank of the  0.0  1.1  1.1  2.3\nPhilippines \nLocal Government Units  0.0  6.3  6.3  12.7\nBeneficiaries  0.0  1.1  1.1  2.3\nTotal    14.5    34.3    48.8   100.0\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  A loan of \u00a53,318,552,500 (equivalent to $30.5 million) from ADB\u2019s \nTerms  ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\n  based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith LIBOR-based lending facility of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 0.5%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nagreement. If ADB\u2019s Board of Directors does not approve the loan \nin  2003,  the  front-end  fee  will  revert  to  1.0%,  or  such  other \npercentage to be determined by the Board. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n \nExecuting Agencies  DBP will be the executing agency (EA) for parts A and B. For part \nC,  HUDCC  will  be  the  EA  for  the  shelter  sector  strengthening \nactivities, while DBP will be the EA for activities related to project \nimplementation support.  \n   \n ", "  v\nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over a 6-year period from 2003 to \nArrangements  2009. HUDCC and DBP will form a project steering committee. \nHUDCC will chair the committee and will have prime responsibility \nfor overall sector policy actions and coordination. Each participating \nLGU  or  other  qualified  proponent  will  organize  a  subproject \nimplementation  unit  (SPIU)  to  ensure  the  project  is  executed \nefficiently and that local communities\u2019 priorities are incorporated in \ndesign  and  implementation.  The  SPIU  will  include  community \nrepresentatives to ensure the proper implementation of community \naction plans and resettlement guidelines. Involuntary resettlement \nwill be minimal as existing sites will be upgraded or new vacant \nsites will be developed.  \n   \nProcurement  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement under ADB loans applicable to \ndevelopment finance institutions will be followed.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A \nteam of international and domestic project management consultants \nwill  help  the  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  implement, \nmanage, and monitor project activities. Consultants will help review \ncommunity action plans and contract documents, and train LGUs, \nmicrofinance institutions, and the PMOs in project implementation, \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  financial  aspects,  and  community \nparticipation.  The  consultants  will  also  assist  HUDCC  in  sector \nstrengthening  activities  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the \ndecentralized shelter delivery framework of the Project. Counterpart \nfunds  of  participating  LGUs  and  other  qualified  proponents  will \nfinance  the  SPIUs.  Domestic  consultants  are  required  for  these \nunits, and they will be recruited through procedures acceptable to \nADB. \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2009 \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will support the poverty reduction goals of the Philippine \nBeneficiaries  Government and ADB, and will improve the quality of life of urban \ninformal settlers. In the envisaged site and services development \nsubprojects, land ownership issues will be resolved and individual \ntitles or other forms of secure tenure will be distributed, directly \nbenefiting  20,000  poor  urban  households.  About  60  poor  urban \ncommunities,  largely  informal  settlement  areas,  are  expected  to \ndirectly  benefit  from  the  sites  and  services  development \nsubprojects,  and  at  least  another  60  nearby  communities  will \nindirectly  benefit  from  offsite  infrastructure,  including  flood \nprotection, roads, and drainage. Similar cases of site improvement \nhave increased land values by 200\u2013700%. Significant gains will \naccrue to implementing agencies in the form of increased revenues ", "vi   \nfrom  property  taxes,  and  to  beneficiaries  through  better  social, \nfinancial, and economic status. \n \nThe  microfinance  shelter  provision  component  will  benefit  over \n20,000 poor urban households. Microfinance for small enterprises \nwill  augment  the  income  of  beneficiaries  who  will  receive  the \nestimated 10,000 loans, and will generate employment for 40,000 \nhouseholds and benefit as many as 100,000 poor urban residents. \nOverall, the Project is expected to have a poverty impact ratio of \nmore than 0.66. \n   \nRisks and  The  key  risks  to  the  Project  are  the  possibilities  of  faltering \nAssumptions  commitment of national and local governments in providing shelter \nfor the poor in a sustainable manner. In particular, at the national \nlevel, the key assumption is that the Government will not undercut \nthe provision of market-based finance by subsidizing interest rates. \nAt the local level, the Project assumes that political commitment to \nmarket-based,  low-income  housing  will  continue  across \nadministrations.  This  assumption  is  well  justified  in  the  present \ndifficult budgetary assessment, as it is unlikely that the Government \ncan afford subsidies required for other approaches. A proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) will address risks associated with timely \nimplementation and subproject approval through effective capacity \nbuilding for the PMO. Risks associated with financial capacities of \nLGUs  are  addressed  by  careful  screening  of  applicants  and  by \neliciting a pipeline of more subprojects than the Project is likely to \nprocess, allowing for dropouts. The risks associated with subsidies \nand titling will also be addressed by capacity-building support to \nboth HUDCC and DBP.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  ADB will provide a $1.5 million TA on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The TA will provide capacity building for DBP, \nHUDCC, LGUs, community-based organizations, and microfinance \ninstitutions.  \n   \n   ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), to be guaranteed by the Republic of the \nPhilippines, for the Development of Poor Urban Communities Sector Project; and (ii) proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Housing Microfinance. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In November 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) to prepare the Development of Poor Urban Communities Sector \nProject (the Project). The PPTA was carried out from June 2000 to May 2001.1 With the help of \nthe PPTA, the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) designed a \ndecentralized investment project in line with the poverty reduction and shelter strategies of the \nPhilippine Government, and prepared a feasibility study on shelter improvement for informal \nsettlers  in  urban  areas,  which  was  approved  by  the  Investment  Coordination  Committee \n(Cabinet Committee) on 24 February 2003. The Project incorporates lessons learned from \nongoing Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction projects in Payatas and Muntinlupa. The proposed \nProject was formulated using a sample of eight pilot communities. Its design incorporates \nfeedback from consultations with the Government and target beneficiaries. This report is based \non the findings of the appraisal mission conducted intermittently in March and April 2003; the \nreports of PPTA consultants; and discussions with national and local governments, international \nassistance  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  beneficiaries.  During  the \ndiscussions, the proposed executing agencies (EAs), the Government, DBP, and ADB agreed \non  the  goals,  objectives,  scope,  scale,  cost  estimates,  and  financing  plans.  The  project \nframework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  The urban population of the Philippines grew from 8 million in 1960 to 39 million in 2000. \nBy 2010, about 54 million\u2014over 60% of the population, from the present 52%\u2014will be living in \nurban areas. Although the official data on poverty indicate that only about 21% of the 7.5 million \nurban households fall below the poverty income line of $265.04 (P13,915) per capita per year, \nat  least  47%  of  urban  households  live  in  informal  settlements2  and  over  60%  of  urban \nhouseholds consider themselves poor, according to an independent survey. \n \n4.  The housing and land markets have not kept pace with rapid urban growth. Each year in \nthe  last  decade,  the  private  sector  supplied  only  about  50,000  housing  units\u2014largely  for \nnonpoor  families\u2014while  the  Government-led  shelter  program  provided  only  about  120,000 \n\u201cunits of housing assistance.\u201d3 Unmet housing demand as of the year 2000 was about 2.4 \nmillion units. The shortfall is concentrated in low-income housing where (i) the population is \nleast able to match rising land and house construction costs; and (ii) the market has not been \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1999.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Development  of  Poor  Urban \nCommunities Project. Manila. (TA 3291-PHI, for $850,000, approved on 10 November 1999, with supplementary \nTA, for $150,000 approved on 2 April 2002). \n2  Typically, households have built on land they occupy illegally, with minimal access to basic services such as water \nsupply and drainage. \n3  Housing accomplishment under the National Shelter Program includes, as indicators of performance, the provision \nof housing assistance, i.e., various services performed toward the completion of a housing unit. Hence, a housing \nunit in the process of completion could receive several financing, loan guarantee, and technical services, all \ncounted as different units of housing assistance. These performance indicators, together with a detailed analysis of \nthe sector, are included in ADB. 2001. Philippine Housing Sector Profile. Manila. ", "2 \nable to provide affordable, conveniently located housing. As a consequence, informal housing \nareas and squatter settlements have proliferated in urban areas. \n \n5.  More than one third of urban families live in makeshift dwellings. Rental housing markets \nare almost nonexistent because of strict rent-control laws. Access to land is a key constraint on \nhousing for the urban poor. Market-based approaches must be found to close the gap between \ndemand and supply, and to enable the sector to provide low-cost housing, financing, sites, and \nservices. \n \n6.  An investment of P432 billion will be required to meet the housing shortage, assuming a \nceiling of P180,000 per unit as defined by Government for housing for low-income families.4 The \nGovernment cannot bear this financial burden alone. Resolution 012 of the HUDCC created the \nmultiwindow lending system in 1996 to (i) improve the efficiency of shelter finance by making it \nmore market-based, (ii) introduce mandatory fund allocation from participating institutions, and \n(iii) transfer the credit risk from the Government to participating financial institutions. However, \nthe housing finance system benefits mostly formal sector employees, especially active members \nof the Social Security System, the Government Service Insurance System, and the Home \nDevelopment Mutual Fund.5 The only program that addresses the need for shelter financing for \nthe poor is the Community Mortgage Program (CMP), which finances the acquisition of lots and \nlow-cost  shelter.  However,  it  suffers  from  several  structural  weaknesses,  such  as  highly \ncentralized management, delays in processing, lack of funds, and lack of trained personnel and \nresources to handle the time-consuming collection of small loans. Only a few local government \nunits (LGUs) have used the CMP to help poor urban communities, and many others have \nstopped originating projects altogether. \n \n7.  External  assistance  has  been  provided  to  sector  institutions  (Appendix  2),  but  the \nmajority of recent assistance has supported decentralization by strengthening LGUs, particularly \nthrough citywide infrastructure projects. The Project does not duplicate any ongoing assistance. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  In the past, slum-upgrading projects tended to emphasize physical improvement and \ndirect provision of housing. The impact of such approaches was usually limited to specific \nlocalities, which in many cases reverted to slum conditions after the projects because of poor \nmaintenance and lack of ownership. Access to affordable land, with title, remains essential to \nmeeting  the  shelter  needs  of  urban  poor  families.  Better  infrastructure  also  needs  to  be \nprovided. Appropriate finance would enable the poor to pay for their land, services, and housing \nimprovements.  The  current  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  projects  in  Payatas  and \nMuntinlupa  are  providing  valuable  lessons  in  community  mobilization,  in  shelter  and \ninfrastructure provision and financing, and in livelihood support, which have been applied to the \ndesign of this Project. \n \n9.  The key opportunities for support to the sector are as follows: \n \n(i)  Extend  access  to  shelter  finance  system  and  enhance  sustainability  of  this \nsystem. This requires action with microfinance institutions (MFIs) on interest rates and \non the subsidy mechanism. To institutionalize accessible financing mechanisms through \n                                                 \n4  This estimate will increase with upward adjustments in the Government\u2019s ceiling for socialized housing. \n5  The fund is a provident savings system funded by voluntary contributions from Government and private employees, \nand mandatory counterpart contributions from employers.  ", "3 \nMFIs, better mechanisms are required for the poor to finance their shelter and livelihood \nneeds. Whatever microcredit is available is generally unsuitable for housing finance as it \nis short-term and comes at high interest rates. Policy dialogue has focused on the need \nto develop mechanisms through MFIs to encourage savings and make Government-run \nfunds  more  accessible  to  the  urban  poor.  The  Government  has  been  indirectly \nsubsidizing the socialized housing program through regulated interest rates. This causes \nmarket distortions and discourages the private sector from providing funds for socialized \nhousing. The Government is committed to introducing market-based interest rates for \nshelter finance in the longer term, but mechanisms must first be found to do this while \nmaintaining affordability for the poor and protecting the poorest. Interest-rate subsidies \nare  costly  to  the  community,  poorly  targeted,  and  unsustainable  for  subsidizing \nsocialized  housing.  The  Project  focused  on  introducing  market-rate  finance, \ndecentralizing subsidy programs, and targeting subsidies to the poor. \n \n(ii)  Facilitate land tenure. The provision of land tenure could be facilitated through the \nsubdivision of surplus government land or through the purchase of private land. The \nurban poor who purchase lots through the CMP\u2014the Government\u2019s flagship pro-poor \nhousing program\u2014can take up to 25 years to obtain a clear land title since the process \nentails 168 steps involving 53 public and private agencies. For the capital value of a \nhouse and lot to be useful to its low-income occupants, there must be some interim form \nof  tenure  that  financial  institutions  would  recognize.  Land  development  regulations, \nincluding land titling, permit issuance, and licensing procedures, need to be streamlined.  \n \n(iii)  Increase private-sector participation. The private sector is not involved in socialized \nhousing, apart from applying 20% of housing development costs to socialized housing, a \npolicy that is poorly enforced and ineffective. Private sector involvement in this market \nsegment is constrained by low profits and interest-rate distortions. The Government \nagrees to review the 20% rule and explore alternative, more transparent mechanisms \nsuch as development impact fees. \n \n(iv)  Enhance the effectiveness of sector institutions. The project design focuses on the \nneed to clarify institutional responsibilities, rationalize the functions of national sector \ninstitutions, and strengthen their capacity to carry out their mandated roles effectively. \nShelter is a mandated local government activity that many LGUs have neglected. The \nstrategic development planning and fiscal and management capacities of LGUs must be \nstrengthened to enable them to tackle this issue effectively.  \n \n10.  These  challenges  provide  the  basis  for  the  central  objectives  in  the  Government\u2019s \nhousing policy and have been key considerations in preparing the project design. The project \nframework set out in Appendix 1 shows how the Project will find serviced, tenured plots; provide \nappropriate  shelter  finance;  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  sector  institutions.  Parallel \nGovernment policy action is set out in a time-bound action plan in Appendix 3. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n11.  The  Project  focuses  on  making  a  direct  and  significant  contribution  to  the  overall \nreduction of both income- and asset-based poverty. The objectives of the Project are to (i) \nimprove the access of poor urban households to secure land tenure, affordable shelter, basic \nmunicipal  infrastructure,  services,  and  community  facilities;  (ii)  improve  access  to  financial ", "4 \nservices for housing improvement and livelihood; and (iii) help decentralize shelter activities and \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  LGUs  to  meet  their  sector  mandates  as  set  out  in  the  Local \nGovernment Code. The Project is a sector project and will be available to all cities and first-\nclass municipalities outside Metro Manila. The Project will address the underlying weaknesses \nin the present subsidy policy and institutional environment that contribute to widespread urban \npoverty, to the vulnerability of the poor, and to their exclusion from mainstream society. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n12.  The proposed Project comprises three parts. In part A, new and existing sites will be \ndeveloped to provide affordable secure tenure6 and infrastructure services for urban families in \nthe lowest five income deciles. The Project will target poor communities where the majority is \nbelow the poverty line. In part B, shelter financing mechanisms will be established, using MFIs \nand  other  qualifying  intermediaries  to  support  (i)  purchase  of  serviced  plot  and  house \nimprovements, and (ii) microenterprise credit facilities. Participating MFIs will be prequalified by \nDBP using agreed criteria and may include thrift banks, rural banks, microfinance NGOs, credit \ncooperatives,  and  savings  and  loan  institutions.  In  part  C,  capacity  building  and  project \nimplementation support programs will be implemented to improve decentralized shelter delivery. \nThe programs will include (i) project implementation support to assist in overall project planning, \ncoordination, management, advocacy, and subproject appraisal; (ii) support for community-\ndriven planning for sustainable development of sites under part A; (ii) capacity building for LGUs \nto enable them to plan, initiate development of, and finance their role in appropriate, inclusive \nshelter projects; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of MFIs to provide finance under part B. \n \n  1.  Part A: Site Development and Tenure Distribution  \n13.  In part A, DBP will relend to qualified LGUs, or other project proponents with the support \nof LGUs, to enable the detailed design and provision of secure, serviced plots in existing low-\nincome neighborhoods and at new sites. Project proponents will include private socialized \nhousing developers, NGOs, and cooperatives approved by DBP. About 20,000 households will \ngain  access  to  land  tenure,  basic  infrastructure,  and  services.  Subprojects  will  include \nappropriate and affordable offsite infrastructure. Priority infrastructure and service requirements \nare likely to comprise access roads, alleys, footpaths, water supply and drainage, sanitation and \nsolid waste management, and basic community facilities. Community services important to an \nimproved quality of life in the subproject area may also be included, as agreed between the \ncommunity and the LGU. This prioritization and agreement is undertaken through a participatory \nplanning process in the community referred to as the community action plan (CAP). The sites \nmay be (i) areas already occupied by informal settlers, where the agency responsible has \nagreed that secure tenure will be provided and existing infrastructure and services upgraded \n(about 30 sites with over 8,000 households); or (ii) vacant lots acquired specifically for poor and \nlow-income housing (about 30 sites for over 10,000 households). LGUs will provide necessary \nonsite and offsite infrastructure and services, according to physical requirements and based on \ncommunity needs and preferences. LGU assistance can expedite the processes of subdividing \na title on a government-owned site and subdividing LGU-owned land. The Project has also \nidentified land-lease forms that can be used to access shelter finance when freehold title is \ninappropriate or impossible. The typical design of the sites is in Appendix 4, and the affordability \nanalysis, taking into account the financing arrangements set out on the following paragraphs, in \nAppendix 5. \n \n                                                 \n6  Secure tenure, as defined by  the Project, includes the provision of lots, houses, or house and lot packages.  ", "5 \n  2.  Part B: Shelter Finance for Low-Income Communities \n14.  In part B, DBP will relend to locally identified intermediaries, which will onlend to poor \nand  low-income  households.  The  intermediaries  will  mainly  be  qualifying  MFIs,  but  other \nqualified financial institutions with an established track record in mortgage and/or microfinance \nlending may be approved for participation as appropriate. Families in the informal sector often \ndo not have access to the formal financial system, which requires borrowers to have regular, \npredictable incomes and collateral. They are thus denied the credit needed to achieve formal \ntenure and upgrade their housing. Government is unable to provide the required subsidies to \nencourage formal financial institutions to lend to this group, and centralized shelter agencies \nlack capacity to manage such a program. Shelter finance using microfinance strategies presents \nan alternative for decentralized financing. The proposed loans are described below. \n \n(i)  B1: microfinance for home improvement. About 2,3007 subloans of up to \n$1,430 (P75,000 or $380 [P20,000] on average), repayable in up to 5 years by \nthe  beneficiaries,  will  be  made  available  through  accredited  MFIs  for  plot \nimprovements. \n \n(ii)  B2:  microfinance  for  small  enterprises.  About  10,0008  subloans  of  up  to \n$2,800 (P150,000 or $475 [P25,000] on average), and repayable in up to 5 \nyears,  will  be  made  available  to  enterprises  typically  engaged  in  noncrop \nagriculture,  trading,  food  and  agroprocessing,  manufacturing,  transport,  and \nother income-generating enterprises. \n \n(iii)  B3: housing loans. Loans will be available for serviced lots and structures on \nnew sites being developed under the site development component, or elsewhere, \nprovided the prospective borrower can present legal proof of land tenure. The \nloans, of terms up to 15 years long, will range from $380 (P20,000) for a core unit \nto $4,285 (P225,000)9 for a basic house, and will average $1,528 (P80,000). \nMFIs would onlend about 12,000 subloans for housing. These loans will be \neligible for guarantee coverage from the Home Guaranty Corporation (HGC). As \npart of their loan repayments, beneficiaries will pay a small fee for the guarantee \nthrough the MFI to the HGC. The guaranty mechanism is financially sustainable. \n \n3.  Part C: Capacity Building and Implementation Support \n15.  In part C, HUDCC will take the lead in strengthening the decentralized shelter delivery \nframework and DBP will lead project implementation support. The capacity-building and project \nimplementation  support  programs,  to  be  financed  through  cofinancing  grants  and/or \nconcessional  credit,  will  comprise  two  components.  ADB  will  also  provide  TA  for  capacity \nbuilding described in Section IV. \n \n(i)  C1: sector strengthening and project implementation support. Additional \nconsulting services to those procured under parts A and B will be provided to the \nproject management office (PMO) at HUDCC for sector strengthening, and the \nPMO  at  DBP  for  project  implementation  support.  Consulting  services  will  (i) \nassist  the  EAs  in  project  planning,  coordination,  management,  evaluation, \n                                                 \n7  Based on surveys made in the pilot communities during the PPTA. \n8  Based on the estimates of the PPTA consultants. \n9  This amount may  be revised to conform with the Government\u2019s ceiling for socialized housing.  ", "6 \nsupervision, and monitoring; (ii) assist the LGUs and communities in subproject \npreparation,  appraisal,  design,  supervision,  and  monitoring;  and  (iii)  support \ntechnical  tasks.  Specific  technical  tasks  will  include  (i)  establishing  and \nimplementing a transparent and directly targeted subsidy scheme, (ii) supporting \nMFIs in enhancing systems for operating and monitoring appropriate lending \nproducts, (iii) developing a public land inventory for the Project, (iv) promoting the \nProject among target communities, and (v) helping coordinate capacity building \nand  community-driven  planning.  Various  aspects  of  these  services  will  be \nfinanced from Cities Alliance and German grant funds. \n(ii)  C2: LGU financial strengthening for shelter provision. This component will \nentail developing capability in geographic information system (GIS) mapping for \nproperty and other tax enhancement, as well as for use in strategic planning and \npoverty mapping. The component will be funded by concessional finance from \nthe Government of Finland. \nC.  Special Features \n16.  The Project addresses the key constraints to providing affordable shelter to low-income \ngroups. It provides mechanisms for enhancing security of tenure in a context where previous \ninitiatives have had very limited success. The CMP requires interest rate subsidies, which \ndiscourage  participation  of  private-sector  financial  institutions.  Owing  to  government  fiscal \nconstraints, topping up funds for disbursement under the program is very slow. The use of \ngroup titles weakens collateral. Almost no infrastructure upgrading is undertaken under the \nCMP, even though this is theoretically possible, as CMP schemes are stalled at land acquisition. \nThe  proposed  Project  addresses  these  structural  difficulties.  Part  A  facilitates  physical \nimprovements in slum areas, and new site development affordable to the poor, where previous \npolicies  have  failed  to  provide  supply  at  pace  with  demand.  Part  B  provides  incremental \nfinancing for shelter on appropriate terms and through financing mechanisms linked to the \nformal financial system, thus bridging the gap between these institutions and the poor. Because \nrepayment  records  for  government  housing  schemes  are  unsatisfactory,  the  Project  uses \ntargeted subsidies to achieve affordability, but retains an incentive for the poor to pay and for \nfinancial institutions to be proactive in ensuring repayment. The Project avoids the past practice \nof distorting interest rates, relying instead on targeted capital subsidies to achieve affordability. \nPart C ensures the sustainability of the Project.  \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n17.  The total project cost is estimated at $48.8 million equivalent, comprising $14.5 million in \nforeign exchange costs (including about $1.8 million in interest during construction), and $34.3 \nmillion equivalent in local currency costs.  \n18.  The total cost is based on estimates prepared for eight pilot subprojects in four LGUs in \nLuzon,  the  Visayas,  and  Mindanao.10  These  estimates  indicate  an  average  base  cost  of \n$191,390 (P10.048 million) per site for basic urban services and land acquisition costs at 32 \nexisting sites, and $301,900 (P15.848 million) per site for 34 new sites. Project cost estimates \nare summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 6. \n                                                 \n10 The LGUs are Angeles City, Bacolod City, Cagayan de Oro City, and Talisay (a first-class municipality recently \nreclassified into a city). ", "7 \n19.  A summary of the proposed financing plan is shown in Table 2. ADB will finance about \n$30.5 million equivalent, or 62.5%, of the estimated project cost. The proposed ADB loan will \ncover $10.2 million in foreign exchange costs, including interest and other charges during \nconstruction, and $20.3 million equivalent of the local currency costs. The proceeds will be used \nto  finance  parts  A  and  B.  DBP  and  the  lending  intermediaries  will  provide  counterpart \ncontributions of up to $1.1 million equivalent for project management and as equity contributions \nfor part B. The Government and LGUs will provide local currency financing of $9.8 million \nequivalent, or about 19.9% of the estimated project cost. Cofinancing from bilateral agencies is \nproposed to fund part C. Grant cofinancing of about $1.3 million equivalent, or 2.7% of the \nestimated project cost, will be required. Concessional credit cofinancing of about $5 million \nequivalent, or 10.3% of the estimated Project cost, will also be required.11 The beneficiaries will \ncontribute $1.1 million equivalent in local currency costs in the form of equity participation.  \n20.  DBP has requested a loan of \u00a53,318,552,500 ($30.5 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 6 \nyears, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s lending facility based on the \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR), a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and a front-\nend fee of 0.5%. The fee will be capitalized in the loan. If ADB\u2019s Board of Directors does not \napprove the loan in 2003, the front-end fee will revert to 1.0%, or a rate determined by the \nBoard of Directors. DBP has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Government will guaranty the proposed loan to DBP \nfor an annual fee of 1%, and will cover the foreign exchange risk for a fee to be agreed with the \nDepartment of Finance. \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nComponent/Subcomponent  Foreign  Local  Total  \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Mix: Relending and Onlending and Government Subsidy  \n1.    Financing Mix \n21.  The financing mix for part A is based on the use of ADB loan proceeds and contributions \nfrom LGUs and other counterparts. The Government will partially subsidize land acquisition \ncosts  for  eligible  beneficiaries.  Once  a  subloan  for  site  development  is  approved,  the \nparticipating LGU or other proponent will first mobilize counterpart contributions for activities \nsuch as land acquisition and detailed engineering design. For part B, the financing mix is based \non (i) proceeds of the ADB loan, (ii) contributions from DBP and lending intermediaries, and (iii) \nequity contributions of beneficiaries. Financing-sharing mechanisms are summarized in Table 3. \nThe ADB loan will fund about 90% of total relending for part B. Appendix 7 presents the \nfinancing arrangements and fund flow for parts A and B. \n2.    Relending and Onlending  \n22.  Under part A, ADB loan proceeds will be re-lent to participating LGUs or private-sector \ngroups in association with LGUs. The subloan to a selected LGU will be for a term of 10 years, \nincluding a 3-year grace period, at a market-determined interest rate currently estimated at 9%.  \n23.  Under part B, loan proceeds will be re-lent to qualified financial intermediaries through \nsubsidiary loans. For the housing loan component, DBP subloans will have a term of up to 15 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years and an interest rate determined by the market \n(currently approximately 9%). Beneficiaries will contribute at least 5% equity. Onlending to \neligible beneficiaries will be at the prevailing market interest rate for a term of up to 15 years. \nFor home improvement and microfinance for small enterprises, DBP will also channel the funds \nthrough financial intermediaries at appropriate market interest rates. These intermediaries will \nonlend at the appropriate market rate for each financial product concerned. DBP subloans to the \nparticipating financial intermediaries will also be repayable in up to 15 years, including a 3-year \ngrace period. For the microenterprise loans, DBP intermediary financial institutions will onlend to \nbeneficiaries according to the implementing rules for microfinance of the Bangko Sentral ng \nPilipinas12 (Circular 272, Series of 2001), and subsequent modifications.  \n                                                 \n12 Central Bank of the Philippines.

Targeted Government Subsidy Scheme \n24.  The subsidy scheme entails a capital subsidy to the purchase price to be paid by the \nbeneficiary. The subsidy is in most cases provided through a reduction in land prices. This \nscheme avoids distorting interest rate subsidies as required under the Medium-Term Philippine \nDevelopment Plan. Subsidies are targeted, as they will be provided to residents in slums. The \nsubsidy is graduated: destitute households will get the full benefit of upgrading investments but \nwill pay only nominal land rent. Other households will obtain title and may still receive a land \nprice  subsidy,  particularly  in  cases  where  land  costs  have  become  prohibitive  because  of \ninefficiencies in the urban land market. \n25.  HUDCC has pledged to contribute at least 220 hectares of public land for the Project.  \nThe net sales proceeds from national land contribution (estimated at about $2.8 million) will be \ndeposited in a shelter finance trust account (SFTA), to be established and administered by the \nNational Housing Authority (NHA) in accordance with a directive to be issued by HUDCC. At the \nLGU level, a parallel local shelter finance fund (LSFF) for the proceeds of LGU land sold under \nthe Project will be established, as needed, before DBP releases the subloan. The LSFF will be \nestablished in accordance with the Local Government Code to recycle the proceeds of the sale \nof LGU-owned lands. These proceeds will be used in subsequent projects as a mechanism for \nadditional  capital  subsidy.  The  funds  will  enable  a  more  flexible  approach  to  ensuring \naffordability  than  in  previous  projects,  where  participating  landowners  usually  provided  a \nsubstantial price subsidy. The project steering committee or its successor agency will approve \nthe use of an SFTA subsidy for purchase of private land (voluntarily sold at market value) for a \nqualifying project. The local housing board will approve the use of LSFFs for the same purpose \nat the LGU level. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n1.  Coordination \n26.   DBP will be the EA for parts A and B. For part C, HUDCC will be the EA for the sector \nstrengthening activities, while DBP will be the EA for activities related to project implementation \nsupport. HUDCC will establish a PMO with a designated full-time project manager to undertake ", "10 \nthe technical and administrative aspects of strengthening the decentralized shelter delivery \nframework. DBP will also establish a PMO to (i) promote the Project to the targeted end-\nbeneficiaries, (ii) assist LGUs, MFIs, and other proponents in subproject development and \nimplementation, (iii) evaluate the technical, financial and economic, social, and environmental \nviability  of  proposed  subprojects,  (iv)  conduct  project  supervision  and  monitoring,  and  (v) \nestablish the project performance monitoring system (PPMS).    \n27.      An interagency project steering committee (PSC), chaired by HUDCC, will be formed to \nprovide policy guidance, implement policy reforms (Appendix 3), and give overall direction. Its \nmembers will include representatives of DOF, DBP, HGC, National Economic and Development \nAuthority (NEDA),  and other appropriate agencies and stakeholders. The PSC will (i) oversee \nproject implementation in conformity with the Project\u2019s development objectives and scope; and \n(ii) assist in coordination among government agencies involved in project implementation and \npolicy reforms. A project management secretariat (PMS), comprising personnel of HUDCC and \nDBP, will constitute the technical working group of the PSC to ensure coordinated and efficient \nproject and project implementation activities. An organization chart for project implementation is \nin Appendix 8. \n28.  A  team  of  consultants  will  assist  the  PMO  in  project  implementation  and  capacity \nbuilding. DBP and HUDCC have agreed to provide office space for these consultants. \n29.  Each participating LGU or other project proponents will set up an SPIU. For LGUs, the \nSPIU will be attached to the city or municipal planning and development office, or its housing \nboard, if one exists. The SPIU will be headed by a representative of the local housing board, \nwho will be supported by leaders of the local community organizations or NGOs. It will be \nresponsible for implementing the subproject components in coordination with DBP\u2019s PMO. The \nSPIU will be assisted by a team of local consultants, if necessary, in (i) preparing community \naction  plans,  detailed  engineering  drawings,  community  contracting  or  local  bidding \narrangements,  and  bid  documents;  (ii)  evaluating  bids;  (iii)  awarding  and  supervising \nconstruction contracts;  and (iv) exercising quality control strategies and schemes. In the case of \nother proponents, the SPIU will be staffed with experienced professionals from its organization. \nDBP\u2019s PMO will approve the key positions and staff to be assigned by the proponent to the \nSPIU. A qualified representative from a local housing board is eligible to become a member of \nthe proponent\u2019s SPIU. For its sector strengthening activities, HUDCC\u2019s PMO will work and \ncoordinate with the SPIUs.  \n2.  Development Bank of the Philippines \n30.  DBP is a wholly Government-owned development finance institution. It was established \nas the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation in 1947 and has gained relevant capacity for LGU \nfinancing by implementing four ADB-supported projects. Its mission is to provide medium- and \nlong-term financing to Philippine financial institutions, enterprises, and LGUs. This mandate has \nbeen broadened to include universal banking. DBP is exempt from the Government\u2019s public \nservice compensation system. \n31.  DBP\u2019s total assets grew at an average annual rate of 12.6% from 1995 to 2002. In 2002, \nits total assets reached $2.95 billion (P148.64 billion), up 7.0% from the previous year. Total \nliabilities also rose during 1995\u20132002, growing by an annual average of 14.0% and outpacing \ntotal asset growth. Total liabilities increased by 6.6% from $2.59 billion (P129.5 billion) in 2002. \nDeposit mobilization has demonstrated encouraging results. Capital adequacy, asset quality, \nmanagement, earnings, and liquidity ratios are all satisfactory. ", "11 \n32.  To ensure the financial viability of the DBP loan and sound financial management, DBP \nwill maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10%\u2014in keeping with the requirement of the \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2014and provide solid provisioning for asset quality. The financial \nstatus of DBP is in Appendix 9. \n3.  Capacity Building and Project Implementation \n33.  HUDCC and DBP will be joint EAs for the grant-funded implementation support and \ncapacity building component (part C). HUDCC will have primary responsibility for capacity \nbuilding of the shelter sector, while DBP will have primary responsibility for components directly \nrelated to implementation support. Both DBP and HUDCC will deal with common issues related \nto  LGUs,  CAP  preparation,  and  strengthening  MFIs  and  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs). These activities must be coordinated between DBP and HUDCC for efficient subproject \nidentification and preparation. Project implementation support consultants will ensure that this \ncoordination occurs. \n4.  Selection and Preparation of Subprojects \n34.  Eligibility  criteria,  selection  mechanisms,  subproject  preparation,  and  appraisal \nprocedures have been agreed upon with HUDCC and DBP. The first three subloans for parts A \nand B will be submitted to ADB for review and approval. Subloans for parts A and B submitted \nfor review, may be from the same subproject. Subsequent subprojects will not require ADB \nreview and approval unless the subloan is more than $2 million. \na.  Part A: Eligibility and Selection Criteria for LGUs  \n35.  The  PMS  will  determine  the  eligibility  of  an  LGU  or  other  project  proponent  in \naccordance with the following criteria: (i) be located, or have a project, in a city or a first-class \nmunicipality  outside  Metro  Manila;  (ii)  demonstrate  financial  capacity  to  borrow,  based  on \nborrowing  capacity  certified  by  DOF,  or  other  collateral  acceptable  to  DBP  and  ADB;  (iii) \ndemonstrate  that  it  can  generate  surplus  income  for  the  next  3  years,  including  project \nexpenses, by providing revenue and expenditure projections endorsed by the LGU treasurer or \na qualified accountant acceptable to DBP; and (iv) have no adverse reports from its banks and \nsuppliers. \n36.  To be selected, an eligible LGU must have (i) inadequate housing and services, as \nevidenced by the existence of slum or squatter communities in its area of jurisdiction and \nsupported by an endorsement letter from the Regional Development Council and a resolution of \nthe Local Development Council; (ii) nationally- or locally-owned government land with potential \nfor inclusion in the subproject, or privately owned land where the proponent has confirmed in \nwriting the intent to provide housing at a price affordable by the fifth income decile or lower; (iii) \ninterest in and commitment to the Project, expressed in a letter of intent from the mayor \nconfirming that the LGU will participate, modify, and adjust its local land-use planning and \nproperty tax management system, if recommended in capacity building; (iv) the technical and \nadministrative capacity to undertake institutional capacity building and subproject management; \n(v) the capacity and willingness to contribute equity; and (vi) willingness to establish a housing \nboard,  and  an  LSFF where  local  government  land  is  used,  serviced  by  a  secretariat  that \nspecializes in housing and the urban poor, or at least a written commitment to create such a \nboard. Other project proponents must also demonstrate that they have (i) clear title to the \nproject land, and (ii) the capacity and willingness to manage the subproject. ", "12 \nb.   Part B: Qualification and Selection of MFIs \n37.  The  PMS  will  determine  the  eligibility  of  participating  MFIs  and  other  lending \nintermediaries based on institutional, financial, and lending performance criteria summarized in \nAppendix  9.  MFIs  with  relevant  capabilities  in  implementing  microcredit  programs  for  the \ninformal sector conforming to ADB\u2019s microfinance development strategy will be preferred. The \nDBP project loan officer will assess compliance with DBP accreditation requirements based on \naudited financial statements and other information. \n5.  Implementation Schedule \n38.  The Project will be implemented from 2003 to 2009. Each subproject will take about 2 \nyears to complete.  Parts A and B will be complemented by (i) a nationwide advocacy program, \na component of part C; and (ii) organizational arrangements among the EAs, LGUs, NGOs, and \ncommunities. Part C has two components, the first of which will engage consultants for sector \nstrengthening and project implementation support. The consultants will then assist the EAs.  \nCapacity  building  will  be  implemented  throughout  the  Project,  although  most  will  be \nconcentrated in the early stages. The implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 10. \n6.  Consulting Services \n39.  For parts A and B, ADB loan proceeds will be used to finance the consulting services \nengaged  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB will be made to engage domestic consultants using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method. Domestic consulting services are estimated to require 175 person-\nmonths.  The  consultants  will  be  experts  in  urban  development,  municipal  engineering, \ncommunity  organizing,  environmental  services,  economic  and  financial  analysis,  housing \nmicrofinance, design and supervision of the project monitoring systems, and microenterprise \ndevelopment.  \n40.  For part C, consulting services will be financed on a grant basis by the Cities Alliance \nand the  German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ). GTZ will contribute $0.4 million for \nproject preparation activities under component C1. The Cities Alliance will provide $0.9 million \nto develop pro-poor shelter strategies. In total, approximately 22 person-months of international \nand 108 person-months of domestic consulting services for shelter planning and community \nmobilization  will  be  financed.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  according  to  the \nprocedures of the relevant agencies. \n7.  Advance Action on Recruitment  \n41.  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  in  recruiting  consultants  and  preparing  detailed \nengineering  designs  and  contract  documents,  starting  with  pilot  subprojects  in  Angeles, \nBacolod, Cagayan de Oro, and Talisay. DBP has been advised that advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project.  \n8.  Procurement \n42.  DBP  will  require  subborrowers  to  follow  ADB  procurement  guidelines  applicable  to \ndevelopment  finance  institution  loans,  which  include  the  obligation  to  (i)  demonstrate  that \nsubborrowers\u2019 procurement procedures are appropriate; (ii) ensure that goods and services are \npurchased  cheaply,  are  delivered  quickly,  and  are  efficient,  reliable,  and  suitable,  with ", "13 \nmaintenance and spare parts readily available; and (iii) in the case of services, ensure the \nquality and competence of providers. All goods and services financed under the ADB loan will \nbe procured from ADB member countries. To promote compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement, DBP, HUDCC, and NHA project managers and staff of other agencies engaged in \nprocurement  will  be  trained  and  briefed  on  procurement  as  appropriate.  International \ncompetitive bidding will be used on all civil works contracts over $2 million and for supply \ncontracts over $500,000. In other cases, local competitive bidding will be used. Goods and \nservices financed by concessional and grant cofinanciers will be procured according to the \ngeneral procurement guidelines of those cofinanciers. \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements \n43.  Loan proceeds will be disbursed according to procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, January 2001. To facilitate the disbursement of small expenditures under the loan, \nDBP will set up an imprest account exclusively for the Project. The initial payment and ceiling of \nthe imprest account will be equivalent to DBP\u2019s anticipated disbursements of approved subloans \nto subborrowers over a 6-month period, or 10% of the loan proceeds ($3 million). The account \nwill be replenished and liquidated on the basis of the statement of expenditures (SOE) prepared \nby  DBP  lending  centers  and  consolidated  at  the  DBP  head  office.  The  ceiling  on  SOE \nwithdrawals will be $200,000. DBP\u2019s accounting systems and internal control procedures have \nbeen assessed and are adequate for the imprest account and SOE procedures. \n10.  Project Supervision and Reporting Requirements \n44.  HUDCC and DBP will separately submit to ADB semiannual progress reports on project \nimplementation. The reports will cover physical performance, summary profiles of feasibility \nstudies, summary appraisals of applicant NGOs and CAPs, progress made in each component \nof part B, and progress made in the HUDCC- and NHA-executed capacity-building programs. \nWithin 3 months of subproject completion, DBP will prepare and submit a report, summarizing \nsubproject  implementation,  operational  performance,  and  an  overview  of  project  progress. \nHUDCC and DBP will prepare and submit to ADB a completion report 6 months after the Project \nis finished, summarizing the overall status of project implementation, operational performance, \nthe project performance monitoring system (PPMS), and targets achieved. \n11.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n45.  DBP, HUDCC, NHA, and participating LGUs and MFIs will maintain separate project \nrecords  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  records  and \naccounts must be sufficiently detailed to identify subloans and subprojects financed by the loan \nand  to  disclose  the  sources  and  expenditure  of  funds,  including  counterpart  contributions \nprovided in cash or in kind. DBP will submit the consolidated project accounts provided by LGUs \nand MFIs to ADB within 3 months of the end of the fiscal year. DBP and HUDCC will (i) have the \nproject  accounts  and  their  financial  statements  audited  annually,  according  to  generally \naccepted auditing standards, by the Commission on Audit; and (ii) submit to ADB, within 9 \nmonths of the end of each fiscal year, a copy of the auditor\u2019s report on the project accounts and \nDBP\u2019s audited financial statements. The auditor\u2019s report on project accounts should include a \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  SOE  procedure.  The \nGovernment and EAs have been informed of ADB\u2019s new policy on submitting audited financial \nstatements and the penalties for noncompliance. ", "14 \n12.  Anticorruption Policy \n46.  The proposed Project will comply with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and guidelines. The \nEAs  will  ensure  timely  submission  of  project  accounts.  Subprojects  will  be  selected, \ncomponents approved, and goods and services procured according to the agreed guidelines \nand criteria. ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the central and local governments, \nDBP, and participating MFIs during project processing. The anticorruption provisions added to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were also discussed, and the section on fraud and \ncorruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement were emphasized. \n13.  Project Reviews \n47.  A midterm review will take place about 2 years after the loan takes effect, to enable the \nGovernment, DBP, and HUDCC to make adjustments in project design and implementation. \nThe review will cover the status of subproject preparation and implementation, the performance \nof  consultants,  subprojects  in  the  pipeline,  assistance  to  LGUs  and  their  poor  urban \ncommunities, microfinance and institutional capacity building, and the possible reallocation of \nloan proceeds. \n14.   Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n48.  The PPMS will be established on the basis of the targets and measurable monitoring \nindicators set up in the project framework. The system will enable the Government and the EAs \nto monitor expected objectives and outputs, and will assist them in planning remedial action if \nthey are not achieved. Monitoring and evaluation will be carried out at all levels of project \nactivity and for all subprojects, and will include participatory and community-based monitoring \ntechniques.  HUDCC\u2014the  agency  responsible  for  the  policy  agenda\u2014and  DBP  will  be \nresponsible for all aspects of project monitoring and evaluation. A PPMS will need to be devised \nto  minimize  information  collection  while  complying  with  both  Government  and  ADB \nrequirements. It must be established early in the Project with the assistance of the project \nimplementation  support  consultants,  and  then  used  in  project  monitoring  and  post-project \nevaluation. Each participating SPIU will implement the PPMS for each completed subproject to \nevaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the benefits accrued.  \n49.  With the help of consultants, the PMOs will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures \nand plans according to ADB guidelines. The project LGUs will undertake PPMS activities such \nas setting benchmarks, collecting information, monitoring benefits, and evaluating social impact. \nThe PMOs will consolidate data and prepare the PPMS for the overall Project. The first set of \ndata on subprojects will be collected within 3 months of loan effectiveness. The results will be \nincluded in the subproject completion report to be prepared by LGUs and eventually in the \nproject completion report to be prepared jointly by the EAs. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n50.  The TA will strengthen systems within DBP, HUDCC, LGUs, and MFIs to enable the \nformulation of housing projects and financing appropriate to the needs of the poor. The TA will \n(i) enable DBP, HUDCC, and LGUs to foster community-based mechanisms for upgrading \nslums and providing low-income housing; and (ii) enable DBP and MFIs to implement financial \nsystems to fund shelter development for the poor and to provide financing for the poor to access \nshelter, neighborhood improvements, and livelihood support. The TA will also provide support to \nthe PMOs in (i) realizing the policy reform agenda; (ii) strengthening LGUs\u2019 shelter planning and ", "15 \noutreach  capabilities;  (iii)  strengthening  the  project  evaluation,  appraisal,  approval,  and \nimplementation capabilities of implementing agencies; (iv) effectively coordinating with other \nagencies involved; (v) coordinating with other external funding agencies over cofinancing; (vi) \nestablishing and making operational a system to monitor and report on project activities; and \n(vii) developing procedures for contract tendering, bid evaluation, and award. Details of the TA \nare described in Appendix 11. \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n1.  Overview \n51.  Once implemented, the Project will help reduce urban poverty in three ways: (i) in part A, \nabout 20,000 urban informal settlers will gain access to land tenure with basic infrastructure and \nservices; (ii) in part B, over 20,000 poor urban families in the informal sector are expected to \ngain access to microcredit facilities and to be absorbed as members of the government social \nsecurity system through savings mobilization; and (iii) in part C, over 60 communities and \npartner NGOs will build up their capacity to prepare, develop, and implement community-driven \ndevelopment projects in a decentralized environment. More than 270,000 people will directly \nbenefit from better houses, communities, and improved access to the formal financial system. \nThe  proposed  off-site  infrastructure,  including  flood  protection  facilities,  main  roads,  and \ndrainage,  will  indirectly  benefit  120,000\u2013230,000  others  residing  in  more  than  60  nearby \ncommunities.  Indirect  benefits  from  basic  urban  services  and  improvements  in  the  slum \nenvironment will accrue to the population in project cities, and will have a positive spillover effect \non adjacent communities. \n52.  Physical  improvements  in  urban  services  and  better  sanitation  in  participating \ncommunities will help reduce waterborne and water-related diseases, improve health, and thus \nbring additional economic benefits through increased capacity for income generation. Reducing \nthe costs of urban services will also save time for informal settlers, thus helping increase their \neconomic productivity. Community participation in development planning and implementation \nwill reinforce the economic and health benefits associated with the water supply, drainage, \nsanitation, solid waste, and community improvement components, and ensure that the initial \ngains provided can be sustained and maintained. Access to microcredit will also allow informal \nsettlers  to  engage  in  more  income-generating  activities.  The  community  development  and \nresettlement policy applicable to the Project is set out in Appendix 12. The Project will benefit \nwomen by addressing security of tenure, improving access to basic infrastructure and services, \nand soliciting their full participation in project implementation. \n53.  Proposed subprojects were subjected to economic and financial analyses, using 2003 \nprices, which included assessments of household affordability and willingness to pay for land \nand  home  improvements,  the  financial  capability  of  MFIs  and  LGUs,  cost  recovery,  and \nsubproject  sustainability.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  calculated  for  the \nsubprojects exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital, and the financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) of revenue-generating components exceeds the real weighted average cost of \ncapital. Land and basic services, as a percentage of the income of each decile of the targeted \nbeneficiaries, are deemed affordable, given the self-targeting subsidies available to the LGU \nproponents, and given, in some justifiable cases, a government land subsidy. ", "16 \n2.  Economic and Poverty Analysis \n54.  The major indicators of the economic viability of the proposed upgrading subprojects are \nsummarized in Appendix 5. Base-case EIRRs for the subprojects ranged from 27.9% to 44.6%, \nexceeding  the  12%  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  and  confirming  the  economic \nrobustness of the proposed subprojects. Sensitivity analysis conducted on parameters that \nincluded a 10% increase in costs, a 10% decrease in benefits, or both, and delays in the \nrealization of benefits, showed that the EIRRs will be highly vulnerable to changes in the \nanticipated benefits. EIRRs for the microfinance subprojects were robust, ranging from 18.3% to \n54.8% because they are short-term, require little capital, and have a high product turnover. The \npoverty impact ratio, based on the direct economic benefits from representative suprojects in \nParts A and B, is 66%. This ratio is significantly higher than ADB\u2019s estimate of 9.2% income \nshare of the urban poor in the Philippines, and confirms the pro-poor impact of the Project. The \npoverty impact analysis is summarized in Appendix 5. \n3.  Financial Analysis \n55.  FIRRs and financial sustainability projections were prepared for the revenue-generating \nsubprojects: (i) microfinance for home improvements, (ii) finance for small enterprises, and (iii) \nhousing loans. FIRRs were not calculated for site development subprojects because all eight \nhave  significant  subsidy  elements.  The  local  governments  will  eventually  recover  project \nsubsidies through property taxes. \n56.  All the microfinance components are viable, with base-case FIRRs of 6.0\u201351.9% above \nthe weighted average costs of capital adjusted for inflation. Major indicators of financial viability \nare summarized in Appendix 5. The financial capability of the LGUs serving as implementing \nagencies for site development were evaluated based on their financial statements and forecasts \nof revenues and expenditures. The cash flow projections indicate that all four pilot LGUs have \nthe capacity to borrow for the proposed investments. The financial analysis of representative \nMFIs ascertained their ability to effectively relend to project beneficiaries and to repay their \nproposed subloans under part B. \n57.  Monthly amortization payments on loans for land and basic services through the MFIs, at \nan indicative interest rate of 12% and a term of 15 years, were compared with the income and \nborrowing capacity of beneficiaries in the pilot subproject areas. Serviced plots will be affordable \nto targeted beneficiaries. Overall, the serviced plots from the pilot subprojects were designed to \nbe affordable to the bottom 50% of urban households (Appendix 13). This targets the urban \npoor, defined by the National Census and Statistics Office as those below regional poverty \nthresholds. Amortization payments for a serviced plot and housing improvement loan package \nwill generally be affordable to urban households in the second to third deciles, and payments on \na serviced plot and housing loan package will be affordable to the third to fifth deciles. In \naddition, households in the target sites will earn increased income through the small enterprise \ncomponent, and by renting space created by home improvements and housing loans. \n4.  Environmental Assessment \n58.  The Project is in environmental category B. Initial environmental examinations were \nprepared for eight pilot communities. All pilot subprojects, and the Project as a whole, will \ngenerate little environmental impact during construction. The civil works are not substantial in \nscale or cost, and most involve improving drainage, roads, footpaths, and water distribution \nsystems. Mitigation measures will include ensuring construction workers are briefed on how to ", "17 \nminimize  nuisance,  and  carefully  planning  excavations  and  other  construction  to  avoid \ndamaging utilities. At most, the negative environmental impact would be interference with other \nutilities, or the temporary increase of solid waste, sewage, dust, or noise during construction. \nMitigation measures will include documenting the work and utilities undertaken. The community-\nbased organization will undertake this documentation, as input to future construction activities. \nAlso important will be the careful design of septic tanks and drainage, and community education \non appropriate site cleaning and maintenance. Recommended mitigation measures are easy to \nintegrate into project feasibility and detailed engineering studies. The Project will fundamentally \nimprove the urban environment through better access, proper handling and disposal of domestic \nwastewater, avoidance of flood damage, and provision of potable water. The summary initial \nenvironmental examination is in Appendix 13. \n59.  For sector projects, site selection criteria include residential safety, which will have to be \nsupported by adequate environmental assessment. DBP has been certified as ISO 14001 \ncompliant13  and  has  the  appropriate  assessment  and  monitoring  arrangements  in  place. \nMitigation  measures  must  be  recommended,  and  the  conditions  set  in  place  for  their \nimplementation before any subproject is approved for site development. Where a proposed \nproject has significant environmental impact as defined under ADB guidelines, DBP will provide \ndetails of the proposed subproject, its impact, and proposed mitigation measures for posting on \nthe ADB web site for 120 days prior to DBP approval. \n5.  Social and Gender Assessment \n60.  According to socioeconomic surveys in the eight pilot areas, about 40% of the residents, \nor 48,000 potential project beneficiaries, are ultra-poor. These families have incomes below the \nsubsistence level, estimated at $166.08 (P8,304) per capita per year in 1997 and defined by the \nNational Statistical Coordination Board as the annual per-capita income required to satisfy \nminimum basic nutritional needs. Other target beneficiaries have incomes below the urban \npoverty threshold or have no formal access to basic services, particularly housing and related \ninfrastructure. \n61.  The Project will generate significant benefits for the urban poor. First, it will lead to \nincreased security of tenure and improved living conditions, and thus to economic, health, and \nquality-of-life benefits. Security of tenure will allow the targeted urban poor to realize the value \nof the capital represented by their house and lot. Second, the Project will improve their quality of \nlife and overall well-being by providing microfinance for home improvements and housing loans. \nThird, the Project will uplift economic conditions by providing microfinance for growth-oriented \nenterprises. The community-driven approach to project preparation (Appendix 12) will ensure \nfull participation from all community groups. \n62.  Women generally bear the brunt of insecurity of tenure and poor access to infrastructure \nand services because they are responsible for their families\u2019 well-being. The Project will benefit \nwomen by addressing security of tenure and improving access to basic infrastructure and \nservices. Women will also be the key beneficiaries of the community development components \nof part C because they are most involved in neighborhood enterprises and community services. \nWomen  will  also  benefit  indirectly  from  education  and  training  in  gender  awareness  for \npolicymakers,  housing  professionals,  national  and  local  housing  officials,  and  NGOs. \nMicrofinance  will  have  a  bias  toward  women,  increasing  their  income-earning  ability  and \ncontributing to their economic independence. This will benefit the entire family, because studies \n                                                 \n13 Certifying that its environmental management practices comply with international standards. ", "18 \nin the Philippines have shown that women give greater priority than men to expenses for \nhousing and basic services. Women will be considered equal partners in establishing CBOs for \nthe Project. They will be consulted and will participate actively in decision-making. The Project \nwill ensure that gender balance is maintained in the representation and membership of the \nelected officers in community organizations.  \n63.  The Project is structured so that no involuntary resettlement will be involved. Where \nupgrading necessitates adjusting plot boundaries or moving structures, the CAP process will \nensure  consent  by  requiring  the  signature  of  all  household  representatives.  Appropriate \ncompensation will be paid to those who are voluntarily moving or are inconvenienced in other \nways. None of the pilot subprojects will affect indigenous peoples, nor is this likely to happen in \nsubsequent batches, because the project targets cities. In the extremely remote case that an \naffected  community  fits  ADB\u2019s  characterization  of  indigenous  peoples,  community-driven \nplanning  mechanisms  will  ensure  the  application  of  the  policy  requirements  in  project \nimplementation. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy assessment is shown in \nAppendix 14. \nB.  Project Risks \n64.  The project risks and safeguards relate primarily to two areas: the amount of interest that \nLGUs and communities show, and the effectiveness of the targeted subsidy scheme. Risks are \nanticipated and mitigating measures proposed in the key areas of political and administrative \nchange, project timing, project approvals, adherence to the policy framework, and absorptive \ncapacity and transparency of the targeted subsidy scheme. \n 65.  Risks Associated with Political and Administrative Change. The Project will rely on \nthe  continuing  commitment  of  DBP  and  HUDCC  to  the  project  approach,  and  of  the \nimplementing agencies such as LGUs and MFIs, to project implementation. Since some degree \nof administrative change is inevitable, the Project must deal with this change in a way that will \nnot harm progress or results. The Project\u2019s goal of poverty reduction will likely remain a central \npillar of government policy. At the local level, negative effects of administrative change can be \nmitigated  by  (i)  a  continuing  awareness  and  advocacy  program;  and  (ii)  the  sector  loan \napproach, which allows ineligible and unqualified LGUs and communities to be dropped and \nnew ones to join. \n66.  Risks Associated with Timely Implementation. The Project is likely to include up to \n25 LGUs and as many as 66 communities. While the project duration is set for 6 years, \nachieving the projected scale and disbursement rate will require (i) qualifying communities and \nLGUs to express true demand, and (ii) an efficient PMO. Furthermore, a lengthy period of \nproject planning and design, resulting from the participatory nature of the Project, may prove \ndifficult to reconcile with the need for rapid processing. Project design will help mitigate these \nrisks in a number of ways. First, the regional offices of DBP and HUDCC will support the \nProject. Second, sector programming gives the Project the flexibility of replacing communities \nthat cannot process loans quickly with those that can. Third, the project implementation support \nconsultancy component includes two elements that will help mitigate these risks: (i) a project \nadvocacy and awareness program involving seminars and workshops for mayors, information \ncampaigns at the regional and LGU levels, and a public awareness campaign directed at \npotential project communities and LGUs; and (ii) a strong project management support team \nworking with PMO staff and technical staff seconded from NHA, which will have the full range of \nskills necessary to minimize processing time. ", "19 \n67.  Risks Associated with Subproject Approvals. The PSC will meet quarterly, or more \noften  if  necessary,  to  review  subprojects\u2019  compliance  with  eligibility  criteria  and  to  assess \nprogress. This committee may seriously compromise timely implementation if it fails to meet \nregularly and make clear, quick decisions. This risk will be mitigated by support from a strong \nPMS and PMOs staffed by competent counterparts and experienced consultants. \n68.  Risks  Associated  with  Policy  Actions.  Efficient  project  implementation  relies  on \nprompt action on the policies above. No major legislative change is needed, but effective \nimplementation of existing laws will require interventions within the regulatory and institutional \nframeworks. While some land management issues will be addressed under a project supported \nby  the  World  Bank  and  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  loan \nconditions will ensure that critical policy actions in support of the Project are taken promptly. The \nPSC must also carefully monitor policy reforms.  \n69.  Risks Associated with Financial Commitments and Absorptive Capacity. The SFTA \nand LSFF aim to reduce cost of serviced plots that LGUs develop, and to make them more \naffordable. However, the scheme currently relies on the LGUs as the core urban development \nagents. The absorptive capacity of the SFTA and LSFF subsidies will therefore depend on the \nextent of the shelter programs the LGUs develop every year. Onsite infrastructure was seldom \nprovided in the past because of a limited budget. Only since the recent entry of government \nfinancial institutions such as DBP and Land Bank of the Philippines into this market have LGUs \nbegun to consider financing infrastructure through debt. The preparation of shelter development \nplans will help LGUs make financial projections of their resources and adopt a more dynamic \npolicy of borrowing from DBP for the purchase of land and the building of secondary or tertiary \ninfrastructure. Such a trend must be encouraged at the subproject level. Every developer of low-\nincome shelter projects can potentially benefit from the increased availability of long-term bank \nfinancing with upfront grants from the SFTA and LSFF. The sensitivity analysis indicates that \nsome subprojects could be vulnerable to a lower-than-expected increase in plot value after \ninvestment, for example. This could slow loan uptake. The project\u2019s focus on the lowest possible \nthreshold of affordability is designed to address this issue. \n70.  Risks Associated with Transparent Subsidy Scheme and Titling Arrangements. \nSFTA and LSFF eligibility criteria should be well understood and transparent. They should be \ninstitutionalized within the LGUs, LSFFs, NHA, PMO, and SFTA, and the project implementation \nsupport consultancy services early in the Project. These criteria will rely on such parameters as \napplicants\u2019 incomes, the costs of subprojects, and the financial condition of the SFTA and \nLSFFs in a given year. Grant applicants should be screened as suggested in para. 69, starting \nfrom the community level (NGOs, LGUs, and CBOs), to minimize political interference and \nleakage. The information processing and support documents should be designed by corporate \norganization  specialists  to  avoid  excessive  red  tape  and  consequent  delays.  Because  the \ncomplex interrelations among land management agencies could delay the issue of final titles, \nthe Project has developed arrangements for interim titles based on the \u2018lease-to-own\u2019 modality \nbacked by HGC. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n71.  The Government, DBP, and HUDCC have given the following specific assurances, in \naddition to the standard assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: ", "20 \n(i)  The Government, through HUDCC, will carry out policy reforms according to the \nagreed policy action plan in Appendix 3. \n(ii)  The Government will rationalize the housing finance sector in accordance with \nExecutive Order 138, including market-based lending at all financial institutions. \n(iii)  The  Government,  through  HUDCC,  and  DBP  will  ensure  that  counterpart \nresources  for  project implementation  are  provided  on  time.  To  this  end,  the \nGovernment and DBP will take all measures necessary or appropriate for the \nprompt disbursement. \n(iv)  HUDCC and DBP will not consider subprojects requiring significant resettlement. \nThe  PMS  will  screen  each  subproject  for  involuntary  resettlement  effects  to \nensure no losses of land, income, housing, community facilities, or resources. \nAny involuntary resettlement arising from land acquisition will conform to the \nresettlement policy in ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, the CAP, and \nthe resettlement policy framework. \n(v)  DBP will ensure that it maintains (a) a capital adequacy ratio of 10% or above, \n(b) a minimum return on average total assets of 0.5%, and (c) a minimum liquid \nassets ratio14 of 25%. \n(vi)  The  Government,  through  HUDCC,  and  DBP  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is \ncarried  out  according  to  the  Philippines\u2019  applicable  environmental  rules  and \nregulations, as well as ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines. \n(vii)  Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the Borrower and the Guarantor will ensure \nthat all land required for a proposed subproject has unencumbered, clear title or \nevidence of clear ownership is acquired no later than the first drawdown of a \nsubloan. \n(viii)  Before a subloan is awarded, DBP and HUDCC will ensure that (a) a local SPIU \nhas been established and appropriately staffed; (b) an adequate CAP has been \nprepared; (c) all beneficiaries have agreed on that plan; and (d) the participating \nLGU has agreed in writing that a specified community-based organization will \nrepresent the community. \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n72.

The  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  nine  subprojects  were  undertaken  in \naccordance with the following Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines: (i) Framework for the \nEconomic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Project, (ii) Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, (iii) Guidelines for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial \nAnalysis  of  Projects,  and  (iv)  Bank  Criteria  for  Subsidies.  This  appendix  summarizes \nSupplementary Appendix B, which sets out the detailed calculation of economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRRs), calculated for all subprojects, and the financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) \ncomputed for revenue-generating components.   \n  \nB.  Economic Analysis \n2.  The proposed site development subprojects will resolve the land ownership issue and \ndistribute individualized titles or other forms of secure tenure instruments. It will also provide \nbasic  services  such  as  roads,  footpaths  and  drains  to  (i)  increase  access  to  employment \nopportunities, (ii) reduce damages, losses, and waterborne diseases associated with flooding, \nand (iii) improve sanitation by increasing the capacity of existing sewer drains. Microfinance \ncomponent benefits were quantified either by imputing the potential increase in property rental \nvalues or by converting the potential stream of net income flows into economic benefits accruing \nto the borrowers. \n \n3.  The major indicators of the economic viability of the proposed upgrading subprojects are \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix D. Base-case EIRRs ranged from 21.0% to 40.5%, \nexceeding the ADB\u2019s 12% economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) and confirming the \neconomic robustness of the proposed subprojects. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on \nparameters that included a 10% increase in costs, a 10% increase in benefits, or both, and \ndelays in the realization of benefits showed that the EIRRs will be highly vulnerable to changes \nin anticipated benefits. The short-term nature, low capital input, and high product turnover of \nrepresentative activities made EIRRs for microfinance subprojects robust, ranging from 18.2% \nto 54.8%. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n4.  FIRRs and financial sustainability projections were prepared for the revenue-generating \nsubprojects: (i) Microfinance for Home Improvements, (ii) Microfinance for Small Enterprises, \nand  (iii)  Housing  Loans.  FIRRs  were  not  calculated  for  the  site  development  subprojects. \nBeneficiaries  had  a  limited  ability  to  pay,  and  spillover  benefits  of  offsite  infrastructure  to \nsurrounding communities meant that some degree of government subsidy would be justified. \nLocal governments will eventually recover subsidies through property taxes. \n5.  The major indicators of financial viability are summarized in Supplementary Appendix D. \nAll the shelter finance subcomponents are viable. Base-case FIRRs are 6.0% to 51.9%, all \nabove the computed real weighted average cost of capital (WACC). \nD.  Poverty Impact \n7.  Supplementary Appendix J sets out detailed poverty impact assumptions. Each major \nproject component is assessed for (i) direct impact on poverty groups based on the income \ndistribution derived from surveys of the pilot sites, (ii) the percentage of direct government \nbenefit, (iii) the proportion of government benefit which will benefit the poor, (iv) the percentage \nof capital costs which will accrue to poor (unskilled labor), and (v) the percentage of operation \nand maintenance costs which will accrue to the poor. These figures are derived from the \n ", "  Appendix 5  33 \neconomic analysis and summarize the poverty impact assessment conducted in Supplementary \nAppendix J. \n \n7.  Pilot project consumer benefits were calculated by deducting the financial payment of \nbeneficiaries from their calculated economic benefit. Key to the large poverty impact of the \nproject is the targeted land subsidy applicable to beneficiaries of upgrading sites. The poverty \nimpact of benefits accruing to government, and the labor component of the civil works and \nhousing constructed under the pilot project, was then calculated. \n \n8.  Table A5 shows the calculation of the poverty impact ratio derived from the experience \nin pilot sites. The pilot sites are representative of the size and type of investments and, broadly, \nof the communities to be serviced. Thus the benefits and costs associated with the various \ncomponents have to be increased to calculate the actual poverty impact of the whole project. \nThese factors are increased in proportion to the relative size of the full project component to the \npilot component. The size of a component is measured in terms of number of households \nimpacted or loans as appropriate.  \n \nTable A5:  Summary Project Poverty Impact \n \n    Impact to Other Stakeholders       \nBenefit Category  Project  Benefits  Total \nGovernment    Labor  Total \nConsumer  to the  Project \nCapital  O&M    Capital  O&M   \nImpact  Poor  Benefits \nSite Development  729.77  5.25  1.82    70.01  24.33  101.42  831.19  1,397.93 \nHome Improvement  10.81  0.63  0.03    12.08  0.00  12.74  23.55  24.30 \nHousing   53.07  14.21  0.53    189.48  0.00  204.22  257.29  243.44 \nMicrofinance  54.44  0.00  0.05    0.00  0.00  0.05  54.49  106.95 \nTotal  848.09  20.09  2.43    271.57  24.33  318.43  1,166.52  1,772.62 \nPoverty Impact Ratio                0.66 \nMicrofinance-Generated Labor  2,597.63 \nPoverty Index with Generated Labor  2.12 \nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nE.  Pricing and Affordability to Targeted Beneficiaries \n9.  Overall, the serviced plots from the pilot subprojects were designed to be affordable to \nthe bottom 50% of Philippine urban households (see Supplementary Appendix B). For residents \navailing  of  both  the  serviced  plots  and  the  housing  improvement  loan  packages,  the \namortization payments will generally be affordable at the second to third deciles of the total \nPhilippine  urban  households.  For  those  purchasing  the  serviced  plots  and  availing  of  the \nhousing loans, payments will be affordable to those comprising the third to fifth deciles of the \ntotal Philippine urban households. Monthly amortization payments for purchasing the serviced \nplots were calculated at an indicative 12% for 15 years, and compared against the income and \nborrowing capacity of the pilot subprojects beneficiaries. All serviced plots will be affordable to \nthe targeted beneficiaries, with the exception of Lagtang and Riverside, whose relatively high \nland acquisition costs, flood protection work, constrained ability of targeted beneficiaries, and \npositive spillover effects justify subsidies. \nF.  Affordability to Local Governments \n10.  The financial capability of the local government units (LGUs), who will serve as the \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  for  the  site  development  component,  were  evaluated  (see \nSupplementary Appendix D) based on their financial statements and forecasts of revenues and \nexpenditures. Internal revenue allotments (IRAs) constitute from 51% to 60% of the regular \nincomes of pilot LGUs. Cash flow projections show all four pilot LGUs have the capacity to \n   ", "34  Appendix 5 \nborrow  for  project  investments.  The  Local  Government  Code  requires  LGUs\u2019  annual  debt \nservicing be limited to 20% of total revenues. Given the financing requirements of the site \ndevelopment component, all pilot LGUs will stay within the debt servicing limit, with the highest \nratio of debt servicing to total income reaching only 5%. Projected financial statements from \n2001 to 2010 suggest that financial performance will improve over the medium term. \nG.  Affordability to Participating Financial Institutions \n11.  For the shelter finance component, the financial capability of eligible, representative \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs) and countryside financial institutions (CFIs) were evaluated (see \nSupplementary Appendix D). Financial projections were also conducted to ascertain their ability \nto  pay  the  subprojects\u2019  debt  servicing  requirements.  For  the  Microfinance  for  Home \nImprovements  and  Microfinance  for  Small  Enterprises  subprojects,  the  Negros  Women  of \nTomorrow Foundation (NWTF), which was seen as a representative MFI, was assessed. With a \ncollection  efficiency  of  97%  and  a  3.16%  portfolio  at  risk,  the  NWTF  is  one  of  the  best \nperforming MFIs in the Philippines. Projections of the NWTF\u2019s financial statements indicate that \nit will continue to operate profitably over the long-term. The MFI exceeds minimum standard \nrequirements set by the Philippine Microfinance Coalition on (i) track record, (ii) outreach, (iii) \ninternal control, (iv) manual of operations, (v) management information systems, and (vi) policy \non write-offs and loan losses. The NWTF will be capable of repaying debt-service requirements.   \n \n8.  For the housing loans subproject, the financial capability of Cooperative Bank of Misamis \nOriental, Inc. (CBMOI), a representative CFI, was examined. CBMOI is among the top ten best \nperforming cooperative banks in the country, with liquidity, profitability, asset quality, and capital \nadequacy ratios consistently above the industry average. Financial projections show it will \ncontinue to generate significantly positive net incomes, with return on assets (ROAs) ranging \nfrom  4.3%  to  19.0%  for  the  period  2001-2010.  The  eligibility  criteria  for  CFIs  have  been \nprepared to attract efficient, innovative, and productive local banks such as CBMOI. CBMOI will \ncomfortably meet the project\u2019s debt servicing requirements (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n ", "    Appendix 6  35 \nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A6.1: Project Cost Summary, by Expenditure Accounts \n \n    (pesos mn)    ($ million) \nExpenditure Account  Foreign  Local  Total    Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Exchange  Currency \nA.

Development Bank of the Philippines \n1.  The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) is a government financing institution \n(GFI) aimed at providing credit facilities to develop and expand the Philippines\u2019 agriculture and \nindustry, and diversify the national economy. Since its establishment in 1947, DBP has played a \nmajor role in the Government\u2019s pump-priming activities by lending facilities to strategic sectors. \nDBP is a conduit for international funds from multilateral sources and bilateral institutions, and \nfor official development assistance (ODA) programs and grants. As a universal bank, it also \noffers a broad range of investment opportunities, business, financial, and lending products. \n2.  DBP is governed by a board of directors whose chairman is appointed by the president \nof the Philippines. A president and chief executive officer serves as vice-chairman of the bank\u2019s \nboard. For the bank\u2019s day-to-day operations, a senior executive vice president is appointed as \nchief operating officer. In addition, the bank has 3 senior executive vice presidents, 3 executive \nvice presidents, 2 first senior vice presidents, 16 senior vice presidents, 9 first vice presidents, \nand 23 vice presidents. \n \n3.  As of December 2002, DBP\u2019s total assets stood at P148.64 billion, making it one of the \nbiggest banks in the Philippines. Total liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity were P129.52 billion \nand P19.13 billion, respectively. In 2002, DBP\u2019s reported net income after tax was P1.87 billion, \ncontributing to a return on assets (ROA) of 1.3%, well above the industry average of 0.8% for \nthe same year. Other indicators of DBP\u2019s financial robustness in 2002 include a return on equity \n(ROE) of 10.22%, equity-to-risk-assets ratio of 24.08%, a past-due rate of 12.90%, and a liquid-\nassets-to-deposits ratio of over 300%. All these ratios were better than the calculated banking \nindustry average for earning performance, capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability, and \nliquidity in 2002.  \n \n4.  Using  modest  growth  assumptions,  DBP  plans  to  continue  to  operate  viably  and \nprofitably in the next 5 years by (i) generating more low-cost deposits as a primary source of \nfunds for lending and investments; (ii) maintaining sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawals; \n(iii) preserving the balance between operating expenses, gross income, and total assets; and \n(iv)  ensuring  that  its  capital  adequacy  indicator  meets  the  central  bank  requirement.  DBP \nestimates its total assets will grow from P148.64 billion in 2002 to P182.22 billion in 2007 (Table \nA9.1), an increase of more than 20%. This growth trend is also reflected in its income after tax, \nwhich is expected to increase from P1.87 billion in 2002 to P2.25 billion in 2007 (Table A9.2).   \n \n5.  A summary of the financial performance indicators of DBP for the next 5 years confirms \nits continued commitment to preserve a capital adequacy ratio that is higher than the central \nbank\u2019s mandated 10% (TableA9.3). Asset quality will be enhanced by keeping past-due rates \nbelow 12% during this period.

Purpose and Output \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will help the Government strengthen systems within the \nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (DBP), Housing and Urban Development Coordinating \nCouncil  (HUDCC),  local  government  units  (LGUs),  and  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  to \nformulate projects and financing appropriate to the housing needs of the poor. The TA will (i) \nenable DBP, HUDCC, and LGUs to foster community-based mechanisms for slum upgrading \nand low-income housing; and (ii) to enable DBP and MFIs to implement financial systems to \nfinance shelter, neighborhood improvement, and livelihood support for the poor. \n2.  The major project components will be (i) support to community-based mechanisms for \nslum upgrading and low-income housing; and (ii) support to improve financial systems to fund \nsuch shelter development. Project outputs will be: (i) improved capacity of DBP to manage the \nprocess of pro-poor shelter finance and of HUDCC to foster LGU planning for appropriate \nprojects; (ii) improved capacity of LGUs to plan shelter for the poor and to undertake the \noutreach required to work effectively with MFIs and poor communities; (iii) improved systems for \nMFI  provision  of  housing  microfinance;  and  (iv)  better  participation  of  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) in the process of financing shelter development for the poor. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n3.  The TA will assist DBP, HUDCC, LGUs, and MFIs to sustain the systems developed \nunder  the  Project.  The  TA  will  be  undertaken  primarily  through  on-the-job  training  and \ndissemination of international and local best practice in the field. It will involve close consultation \nwith representatives of communities likely to benefit from the Project and the NGOs assisting \nthem, particularly in respect of sustainable mechanisms for effective community participation. \nThis aspect of the Project is important as a sustainable financing system for low-income people \ndepends on their clear understanding of the Project, their establishing a strong trust and savings \nrelationship with the MFI concerned, and their commitment to service the loan. \nTable A11.1: Technical Assistance Framework \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \nThe urban poor and  The number of:   Local government and  Continued and \nvulnerable near-poor  -  poor and near-poor  nongovernment  consistent commitment \nparticipate in and  households with  organization (NGO)  of Government to \nbenefit from shelter  reduced vulnerability  records of development  poverty reduction \nfinance to increase  to economic,     \ntheir income, assets,  environmental, and  PMOs\u2019 records  Stable macroeconomic \nand well-being.  other adverse impacts;  management with \n  -  households benefiting  growth rate higher than \nfrom improved  rate of population \nhousing;  increase \n-  households benefiting   \nfrom improved  Good governance and \nenvironmental  effective decentralization \nconditions;   \n-  households with  No financial sector \naccess to local  meltdown \nmicrocredit; and \n-  poor and near-poor \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nhouseholds with \nreduced vulnerability \nto economic, \nenvironmental, and \nother adverse impacts \nPurpose       \nLocal governments and  The number of:   As above  Adequate revenue and \nother eligible  -  city participatory    willingness to borrow on \nproponents regularly  upgrading and new  PMOs and consultants  the part of local \nimplement bankable  site projects targeted  records  governments \nshelter projects for the  to the poor and near-    \npoor in partnership with  poor;    Acceptance of targeted \npoor communities  -  poor and near-poor  and market-friendly \n  beneficiaries of such  subsidy mechanisms \nFinancial institutions  projects; and \nwill have and use  -  local parliament \nprofitably shelter  endorsed pro-poor \nfinance products  shelter development \nappropriate to the  strategies \nneeds of the poor \nOutputs       \nCity shelter strategies  Number of shelter  Progress reports and  Successful launch of the \n  strategies  review missions  Project  \nUpgrading projects     \n  Number and size of  Project Performance \nNew site   projects/community action  Monitoring System \ndevelopment projects  plans fully prepared  (PPMS) of the Project  \n   \nShelter finance  Number of microfinance \nproducts appropriate to  institutions serviced \nthe needs of the poor \nestablished within \nfinancial institutions to \nwhich the poor have \ngood access \nActivities/Inputs       \n(to be developed \nthrough the \nimplementation of \ntechnical assistance) \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n4.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2.15 million equivalent, comprising $570,000 in \nforeign exchange and $1,580,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $1,500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign currency cost and $930,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the \nADB-funded TA program. It is estimated that about 50% of the ADB grant will be used for \nshelter  sector  strengthening  activities,  and  the  remaining  50%  for  project  implementation \nactivities.  HUDCC  and  DBP  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  costs  amounting  to \n$650,000  equivalent,  which  cover  the  office  and  support  facilities,  counterpart  staff, \nadministrative support, part of workshop expenses, report production and dissemination, and \nlocal transportation.

Implementation Arrangements \n5.  The joint executing agencies (EAs) for the TA will be HUDCC and DBP. The lead EA for \nshelter sector strengthening activities is HUDCC, and for the capacity building activities related \nto project implementation support, DBP. HUDCC will establish its project management office \n(PMO) with a designated full-time project manager to undertake the technical and administrative \naspects of strengthening the decentralized shelter delivery framework. DBP will also establish \nits PMO for project implementation. Both EAs will ensure that suitably qualified and experienced \ncounterpart staff in their offices will work alongside the TA consultants. The TA consultants will \nprovide full support to HUDCC in respect of sector strengthening activities, and to DBP in \nrespect of capacity building for implementation activities. They will work in close collaboration \nwith their counterpart teams in accordance with an agreed work plan to be established in the \nInception Report. The project steering committee (PSC) will serve as the TA steering committee \nand will be chaired by HUDCC, with members from Department of Finance, DBP, the National \nEconomic and Development Authority (NEDA), and other concerned agencies, and will be \nestablished by the end of month one of the TA project. A project management secretariat \n(PMS), comprising personnel from HUDCC and DBP, assisted by the TA consultants, will \nconstitute the technical working group of the PSC to ensure coordinated and efficient project \nimplementation. \n6.  The  TA  will  require  21  person-months  of  international  and  108  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting with expertise in housing and microfinance, shelter upgrading, development \nand management, municipal finance, sociology and resettlement, environmental sciences, and \nland law.

Short-form proposals will be \nsought. Any procurement will be conducted according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nHUDCC will be responsible for providing the agreed counterpart resources. The consultants will \nbe based in Manila and will be expected to travel as necessary to the regions. \n7.  The TA is expected to commence in December 2003, and will be implemented over 36 \nmonths with the submission of a final report in December 2006. The consultants will also \nproduce (i) an inception report at the end of the first month; (ii) capacity building strategies and \nprocedural manuals for DBP, MFIs, and LGUs in months 4 and 12; (iii) detailed shelter plans \nand CAPs for all participating cities by the end of month 21; and (iv) a summary of training and \nworkshops conducted, complete with training strategies, materials presented and attendance \nlists. Tripartite reviews will be held to evaluate each of the outputs, and seminars associated \nwith these reviews will present progress to, and obtain input from, central government agencies, \nlocal governments, civil society, and representatives of the communities involved. \nE.  Outline Terms of Reference for Consultants \n \n1.  Objectives \n8.  The objectives of the proposed TA are to assist the DBP and HUDCC, in establishing, \ninstalling,  and  initially  supervising  affordable  shelter  finance  systems  for  the  poor  using  a \ncommunity action planning approach in the participating LGUs, MFIs, and community-based \norganizations (CBOs). At all levels, capacities need to be built to manage, implement, and \nmonitor the new poverty reduction methodologies. \n2.  Scope of Work \n9.  The consultants will prepare an overview of all structural and procedural requirements \nfor  project  implementation  and  develop  a  set  of  implementation  guidelines  for  all  project \ncomponents. These guidelines will clarify key policies, principles, and strategies of the project \nand  will  provide  a  detailed  framework  for  project  implementation.  In  consultation  with  all \nstakeholders, they will design a comprehensive training program and train the staff of DBP, \nHUDCC,  NHA,  HGC,  and  the  selected  LGUs  and  MFIs  to  ensure  the  sustainability  and \nreplicability of the Project approach.  \n10.  In  participating  communities,  and  in  other  areas  where  resources  are  available, \nconsultants will build the capacity of community organizations that are project finance recipients. \nCommunity organizations will require strengthening to manage the process of interaction with \nMFIs, community action planning, savings-and-loan operations, and project activities. They will \nbe  made  familiar  with  project  procedures  and  trained  to  participate  in  all  stages  of \nimplementation. Communities will also be important in verifying project policies and approaches. \nThe consultants will document a \u201cgood practice\u201d approach for DBP, HUDCC, LGUs, other \neligible proponents, and the MFIs. \n11.  Consultants will establish within MFIs the systems for disbursing and monitoring shelter \nand small-business loans based on an analysis of the present financial systems, to facilitate \ncontrol  and  monitoring  of  loan  funds.  They  will  develop  and  undertake  financial  training \nworkshops for MFI staff, assist in installing the financial systems, and supervise the operations \ninitially. In particular the consultants will: \n(i)  examine and analyze present financial operations, computerization, and MIS \nrequirements  of  representative  participating  MFIs  with  regard  to  their \nmicrolending and monitoring systems needs; \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \n(ii)  determine, in conjunction with the sample MFIs and DBP, the types of financial \noutput  and  the  reporting  format  required  for  effective  management  and \nmonitoring  of  shelter  microfinance  as  programmed,  by  MFIs  and  design  an \nappropriate benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) system incorporating needs \nof DBP, MFIs, and beneficiaries; \n(iii)  establish the minimum requirements for prudent financial controls and design a \nrecording and analysis system that (i) can be easily understood and adopted with \nminimum staff and computer requirements; and (ii) will ensure that all financial \nintermediation is recorded in an appropriate form, using standard definitions and \nmethodologies to facilitate control and monitoring of funds; \n(iv)  evaluate the hardware and software being used by MFIs for their portfolio, design \nadditional systems in consultation with these organizations, and integrate new \nsystems into their financial controls; \n(v)  undertake, at selected locations, a series of financial training workshops for MFI \nstaff, accountants, and bookkeepers, augmented by training at selected MFIs \nwhere staff from surrounding organizations would assemble; \n(vi)  after developing, testing, and supervising the installation of the required financial \nrecording  and  analysis  system  in  the  selected  MFIs,  prepare  an  operations \nmanual to provide step-by-step instructions for other MFIs seeking to install an \nappropriate financial control system; \n(vii)  provide a trouble-shooting service to resolve the difficulties of MFIs in installing \nthe new systems and provide refresher training courses; \n(viii)  review the existing and proposed operational systems; and design, test, and \ninstall appropriate BME systems to provide an efficient means of monitoring the \noperation and  the impact of the project investment; and \n(ix)  document a \u201cgood practice\u201d approach to these activities for DBP and HUDCC. \n12.  The  consultants  will  analyze  the  capacity  of  participating  LGUs  and  make \nrecommendations for institutional adjustments to ensure that LGUs will be able to undertake the \nshelter-related poverty reduction program. In the decentralized shelter and poverty reduction \nprogram, LGUs will play a pivotal role for which they need to be prepared institutionally and in \nterms of human resource development. LGUs should become more responsive to the needs of \nthe urban poor and a systematic approach of cooperation between the urban poor, MFIs, and \nLGUs will be developed. In each participating LGU, the consultants will produce sample city \nshelter plans and community action plans (CAPs). The consultants will undertake technical and \non-the-job training of LGU staff in the new approaches. The consultants will document a \u201cgood \npractice\u201d approach to these activities for DBP, HUDCC, and MFIs. \n13.  For  DBP,  the  consultants  will  (i)  design  systems  for  DBP  appraisal,  support,  and \nmonitoring of pro-poor housing development, CAPs, and MFI sublending; and (ii) train the staff \ninvolved in implementing these activities. For HUDCC, the consultants will (i) assess the need \nfor broader systems of support to sustain the preparation of pro-poor housing development, \nCAPs, and housing microfinance; (ii) prepare an action plan for putting these into place; and (iii) \ntrain  the  staff  involved  in  implementing  this  plan.  Coordination  between  capacity-building \nelements is critical, and linkages with the main project components essential. Consultants will \nbe required to coordinate other capacity building activities with DBP, HUDCC, and the project \nsteering committee. \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \n \nSUMMARY COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND RESETTLEMENT \nA.  Background \n1.  The Philippines has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for $30.5 million \ndollar equivalent loan for a sector loan to undertake the Project. The Project will improve the \nlivelihood quality of life and reduce poverty in selected mid-size Philippine cities and first-class \nmunicipalities through land titling and other forms of secure tenure for informal settlers, on- and \noffsite upgrading, and microfinance for housing, home improvements, and small enterprises. \nNine pilot subprojects were identified and are in various preparation stages. Discussions with \nthe National Housing Authority (NHA), local government units (LGUs), and nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  in  pilot  subproject  areas,  site  visits,  and  interviews  with  project \nbeneficiaries and community associations constitute the basis for this summary. \nB.  Land Acquisition/Resettlement Strategy \n2.  Given its subproject selection criteria and highly participatory planning approach, the \nProject is not generally expected to cause involuntary land acquisition and resettlement. The \nselection criteria ensure that site acquisition will not involve the exercise of the principle of \neminent  domain  and  participation  of  project  beneficiaries  to  off-site  schemes  is  voluntary. \nParticipatory  planning  guarantees  that  minor  land  losses  caused  by  reblocking  are  freely \ncontributed  by  affected  informal  settlers  or,  if  needed,  replaced  through  voluntary  land \nredistribution.  To  warrant  the  rehabilitation  of  informal  settler  participants  in  the  upgrading \nschemes,  serviced  plots  will  be  priced  at  rates  affordable  to  them,  house  losses  will  be \ncompensated at replacement cost; and relocation subsidies provided. If in exceptional cases \nunexpected involuntary land losses to formal settlers will occur, they will be fully compensated in \naccordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \nC.  Participatory Planning and Land Acquisition/Resettlement Guidelines (PPLARG) \n3.  To guarantee community participation and compliance with ADB's resettlement policy, a \nset of PPLARG was prepared. The PPLARG addresses issues within and beyond the scope of \na  resettlement  plan  detailing  (i)  subproject  selection/processing  criteria;  (ii)  participatory \nplanning tools; and (iii) a resettlement policy framework. \n1.  Subproject Selection and Processing Criteria \n4.  The following criteria will regulate subproject selection/preparation: \na.  Eligibility Criteria \n(i)  Off- and onsite scheme areas must have been public for at least 2 years before \nbeing submitted for consideration; or, if still private, their price must have already \nbeen negotiated between relevant community associations and landlords. \n(ii)  Offsite scheme areas cannot replace land affected by infrastructure projects. \n(iii)  Offsite  development  areas  must  be  tied  to  specific  beneficiary  communities, \nwithin 15 kilometers of their original residence, and supported by an initial social \nassessment.  \n ", "Appendix 12  51 \n(iv)  Proof  of  beneficiary  acceptance  of  offsite  subproject  site  must  be  available. \nSettlers unwilling to relocate will be able to remain at their premises without \nsanctions. \nb.  Appraisal Criteria (at least 6 months after selection) \n(i)  Community  associations  must  be  well  established,  operational,  and  fully \nendorsed by project beneficiaries;  \n(ii)  Appraisal  will  be  based  on  a  community  action  plan  (CAP)  prepared  by \nbeneficiaries  with  NGO  assistance  and  technical  facilitation.  Community \nassociations will endorse the CAPs. \n(iii)  If  after  10  months  the  above  criteria  are  not  satisfied,  a  subproject  will  be \ndropped. \n2.  Participatory Planning and the Community Action Plan (CAP) \n5.  CAPs will be fully participatory initiatives prepared by beneficiaries and facilitated by \nNGOs. CAPs will detail (i) community association status and participatory planning history, (ii) \nagreed subproject design and implementation/organization features, (iii) land/house impacts by \nhousehold and compensation agreements, (v) agreements on land prices and voluntary land \nlosses, (vi) replacement plots location, (vii) land acquisition and resettlement budgets, and (vii) \neventual involuntary resettlement cases and relative resettlement plan in keeping with the larger \nresettlement policy framework. \n3.  Resettlement Policy Framework \n6.  The PPLARG will include a resettlement policy framework, which will be prepared based \non ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. The PPLARG will establish \ncompensation provisions for land and other losses affecting both informal settlers and eventual \nformal settlers and will detail land acquisition and resettlement implementation/organization \nfeatures, including institutional responsibilities, disclosure mechanisms, grievance procedures, \nand monitoring/evaluation schemes. \n7.  Land Losses. As for informal settlers, marginal residential land losses (less than 20%) \nwill not be compensated while severe residential land losses (more than 20%) will be replaced \nthrough voluntary land redistribution of their community land. Informal settlers will pay for their \nplots at an agreed price and receive a title. All land losses of formal settlers affected by \nsubproject developments will be fully compensated in cash at market rates. \n8.  Other Provisions.  All other provisions are the same for informal settlers and eventual \nformal  settlers.  House  impacts  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  replacement,  cost  free  of \ndemolition and salvaged materials. Crop losses will be compensated at market rates. Business \nlosses will be compensated through a monthly allowance equal to P1,000 or to the declared \nmonthly incomes for each month of business interruption. Settlers forced to relocate will also \nreceive a fixed disturbance allowance of P15,000. \n9.  Institutional Responsibilities. DBP, with technical assistance from HUDCC (supported \nby NHA staff), has overall responsibility for subproject appraisal and resettlement. Liaison with \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \ncommunity  associations  and  NGOs\u2014as  well  as  land  management,  asset  valuation,  and \nentitlement delivery\u2014will be the responsibility of project proponents. \n10.  Disclosure and Grievance Procedures. The resettlement guidelines will be distributed \nin all beneficiary communities and will be disclosed at the ADB country office together with each \napproved CAP. Grievances would be first lodged to a community grievances committee. If the \ncase is not settled within two weeks, the complainant will lodge the grievance to the office of the \nneighborhood  captain.  If  still  unresolved  within  1  month,  the  case  can  be  taken  to  the \nappropriate court. \n11.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The PMO will establish a monthly reporting system on \nCAP implementation and resettlement. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent \nagency. The PMO will report quarterly to ADB on land acquisition and resettlement. External \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB twice a year. \nD.  Pilot Subprojects \n12.  Nine Pilot Subprojects were Identified. For three of them, the participatory planning \nprocess has been successfully concluded and CAPs are ready for appraisal. One subproject \nfailed because two community associations did not agree on land prices or the location for \ndevelopment. The other four are currently under preparation and will be appraised when the \nCAPs satisfying the selection criteria are finalized and become available. Details of subprojects \nwith CAPs completed or in the advanced stage of preparation are below. \n13.  Sapalibutad, Angeles. This subproject entails onsite reblocking, remains at an initial \npreparation stage, and is based on a CAP not yet ready for implementation. The target site is a \n2.0 hectare (ha) area inhabited by 300 households represented by the Nagkakaisang Samahan \nng  Sapalibutad  Resettlement.  Subproject  provisions  include  land  security  to  300  local \nhouseholds. A CAP will be available when reblocking impacts have been fully assessed.  \n14.  Pulungbulo,  Angeles. This  offsite  development  subproject  is  fully  prepared  and  is \nbased  on  a  CAP  ready  for  implementation.  The  subproject  site  is  a  0.63  ha  area  to  be \npurchased by Angeles City at P200 per square meter, as set by a deed of sale already issued. \nThe site will be used to resettle 46 informal households that will be evicted from a nearby \nproperty, and will also settle additional 21 formal settler households. These 67 households are \nrepresented by the Tinig ng Pagkakaisa ng Pulungbulo Association, which prepared the CAP. \nProvisions include land titling, site preparation, utilities, infrastructure, and livelihood programs. \nThe 41 informal settler households will receive full compensation at replacement cost for their \nhouses  plus  disturbance  allowances.  House  compensation  will  amount  to  P707,000,  while \nrelocation subsidies will amount to a total of P15,000 for the entire subproject.  \n15.  Malabanias, Angeles. This subproject entails onsite reblocking, is fully prepared, and its \nCAP is ready for implementation. The subproject site is a 3,107 ha area inhabited by 253 \nhouseholds  represented  by  the  Acaban  Malabanias  Urban  Poor  Association.  Subproject \nprovisions include titled plots. Reblocking will affect 39 households to be affected by fence or \nhouse damages. Compensation will amount to P231,800 for the entire subproject. \n16.      Marisol BLISS, Barangay Ninoy Aquino, Angeles. This subproject entails onsite \nreblocking/upgrading, is fully prepared, with CAP ready for implementation. The project is a \n3,171 ha property. The beneficiary community includes 499 households fully represented by the \nBLISS Urban Poor Association. Subproject provisions include titled plots to 253 households. \n ", "Appendix 12  53 \nEight households are affected by reblocking. Impacts consist in partial house demolition or \ndamages. Repairs will amount to P154,109.  \n17.     Purok Esperanza, Bacolod. This subproject involved onsite upgrading/reblocking, offsite \ndevelopment, and involuntary resettlement for a service road. A CAP has not been successfully \nconcluded as beneficiaries are split into two CAs with different views on land prices and CAP \ndetails.  As  a  result,  the  LGU  has  submitted  another  site  to  replace  this  pilot  subproject. \nPreliminary design and impact assessment indicated that 400 households would participate in \nonsite development and that 20 houses will be relocated in the nearby offsite development area.\n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Environmental Measures \n1.  Introduction \n1.  This  section  presents  the  summary  of  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE), \nfindings,  and  recommendations  conducted  on  proposed  upgrading  subprojects:  Marisol, \nMalabanias, Sapalibutad, and Pulongbulo in Angeles City; Tangke and Lagtang in Talisay City, \nCebu; Villa Pook Esperanza and Purok Riverside in Bacolod City; and Macabalan in Cagayan \nde Oro. The conduct of the IEEs has allowed timely identification of environmental impacts and \nthe required mitigation measures for the pilot sites. The IEE also led to the revision of one site \ndevelopment plans as proposed by the participating local government units (LGUs) and the \nabandonment of two proposed subprojects. \n2.  The procedure adopted in identifying all significant environmental impacts from different \nstages of subproject development1 is contained in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) 1993 \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects  (Checklist  of  Environmental \nParameters for Urban Development Projects), and the results were checked for consistency \nagainst the new guidelines, except for the Sapalibutad and Pulongbulo subprojects where the \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) were used. A more detailed description of \nenvironmental issues relating to the Project is set out in Supplementary Appendix K. \n2.  Description of the Project and Environment \n3.  All subprojects involve small-scale civil works such as local roads and drains to improve \nthe environment of poor communities. All subprojects generate small, significant environmental \nimpacts during design and construction. The civil works required in the Marisol, Malaba\u00f1as, \nSapalibutad, Pulongbulo, Tangke, and Macabalan subprojects are not substantial in terms of \nscale and cost, and involve mostly onsite improvement of drains, roads, and water distribution. \nThe  proposed  works  by  their  very  nature  mitigate  environmental  impacts  and  reduce  the \ninherent health risks attributable to unplanned development. However, the subproject areas\u2019 \nhigh  population  density  multiplies  small  environmental  impacts  and  warrants  attention, \nparticularly in the planning stage. \n4.  The proposed subprojects will upgrade communities with limited available land and plots \nthat are still vacant are already earmarked for disposition. The constraints brought about by \nunplanned house construction and the complex systems resulting from the contingent layout of \ndrainage canals and water lines installed by individual settlers cause the majority of identified \nsignificant environmental impacts. Since existing drains and water lines are located in the same \ntrench and usually follow alleys and footpaths, any improvement on any of these will interfere \nwith other components. Nonetheless, the impacts on utilities are short-term and co-terminus \nwith construction. \n5.  The environment of the subproject sites is already urban, albeit poorly serviced. No \nsignificant species of flora or fauna were found. Topography varies, but with the exception of the \nTalisay site (see below) is generally flat. Soil conditions also vary from sandy soils to clay. \n                                                 \n1  Including location, design, construction, and operation stages. \n ", "  Appendix 13  55\n3.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n6.  Impacts  common  to  the  subprojects  and  recommended  mitigation  measures  are \nindicated in Table 1 below. These recommended measures are simple and easy to integrate in \nthe feasibility and detailed engineering studies. \nTable A13: DPUCP Subproject Environmental Impacts and \nTypical Recommended Mitigation Measures \nImpacts  Recommended Mitigation Measures \nEnvironmental problems due to design \nInterference with other utilities in same trench  With residents and the local water utility, prepare a \ndetailed  map  of  each  residential/subdivision  block \nshowing the alignment of existing water lines. Prepare \nan  excavation  schedule  of  each  section  of  the \nproposed drainage system that avoids or minimizes \ninterference with water line. \nIntensification of water pollution control  With limited available area, a combined sewer and \ndrainage canal is recommended. The prohibitive cost \nof a centralized sewage treatment plant does not allow \nits  construction.  Ensure  that  all  households  have \nseptic tanks that are regularly maintained for proper \noperation. \nWhen possible, re-use domestic washwater coming \nfrom bathrooms and sinks for irrigation. \nCreation of sewage/sanitation problem  Cover open drainage canals along the major roads \nwith concrete slabs. Ensure that all households have \nseptic  tanks  that  are  regularly  maintained.  When \nfeasible, convert all footpaths and alleys as covered \ndrain  to  ensure  adequate  canal  capacity,  optimize \navailable space, and minimize health risks. \nEnvironmental problems in construction stage \nHazards  to  workers  and  nearby  residents  to  Educate all construction workers on handling sewage. \ncommunicable diseases and from emissions of dust,  Equip workers with proper protective gear such as \nfumes, noise, and vibration  rubber gloves and boots. To minimize nuisance, heavy \nequipment operation should be done during daytime \n(9-6 pm). Inform affected residents prior to equipment \noperation. \nAccidental damage to utilities in the same trench  Based on the detailed map showing the location of \nwater  pipes  and  excavation  map,  inform  affected \nresidents on possible disturbances in water supply. \nDrainage canals to be constructed along/as footpaths \nthat will affect access should be done in phases and \nimmediately covered by metal sheets or catwalks.  \n4.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management System \n7.  Because subprojects will not have significant environmental impacts, participating LGUs \nwill be required to obtain either certificates of noncoverage or environmental compliance from \nthe  regional  Environmental  Management  Bureaus  of  the  Department  of  Environment  and \nNatural Resources (DENR). This will require consultant support to the project management \noffice (PMO). Part C cofinancing will provide this, while institutionalizing the capacity within the \nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (DBP). \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \n8.  The environmental management system is integrated into the subproject approval and \ncommunity action plan (CAP) processes. The PMO will not approve subprojects without the \nappropriate  environmental  clearance  and  environmental  management  plan.  The  steering \ncommittee  will  monitor  compliance.  The  CAP  process  is  consultative,  and  designs  project \ninterventions with the community concerned and written approval from all community members \nis required (see below).  \n5.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n9.  Ample opportunities were ensured for the public to participate in the design process of \nall subprojects. These opportunities came in the form of: \n(i)  Subproject site walkthroughs with the officers of homeowners associations, local \nhousing boards, HUDCC regional officers, bank officers, and jurisdictional local \ngovernment officials. These walkthroughs, in addition to a good appreciation of \nthe subproject as platform for intervention where environmental impacts will be \nidentified  and  evaluated,  allowed  immediate  responses  on  the  subproject \ntopology that maximize positive environmental impacts. During each study team \nvisit, at least three walkthroughs were conducted. \n(ii)  Workshops were conducted where the subproject initial design was discussed \nand  ADB\u2019s  environmental  screening  process  is  presented.  The  consultant \nprimarily informed the community of the environmental impacts of the subproject. \nThis workshop also validated the consultant\u2019s assessment of the impacts. During \nthese workshops, the need to comply with local environmental regulations was \nalso emphasized.  \n(iii)  A  one-on-one  discussion  with  the  local  mayor  was  conducted  to  present  in \nsummary the findings and initial recommendations of the study team. Issues \nraised during the walkthroughs and workshops were revalidated. This discussion \nalso sought to determine the mayor\u2019s priority on subproject implementation. \n(iv)  A meeting with the regional HUDCC and local housing boards, discussing the \nissues raised and needed activities for its resolution, were presented by the study \nteam. \n(v)  A socioeconomic and perception survey was conducted in coordination with local \ncolleges, universities, and institutions, and results were used to assess baseline \nconditions and attitudes on a range of issues including environmental issues. \n10.  The length needed for the regional HUDCC and local housing board to consult on \nsubproject design is noteworthy. The communities are asked to prepare a CAP that consisted of \ndocumenting the planning process and their site development goals presented in the form of \nsubproject proposals. \n11.  The CAP itself is a product of an intensive consultation process as embodied by the \nprinciple of participatory planning and community-led approach to development. This implies \nthat  interventions  are  conceptualized,  designed,  planned,  and  implemented  by  community \nmembers themselves in close collaboration with the local government and guided by sound \nurban planning, social, and environmental principles. The CAP is the result of consensual \nagreements that could only be achieved through constant interaction among those involved. \n ", "  Appendix 13  57\nAside from documenting the public consultations undertaken, the CAP outlines proposals and \ndesigns from community members themselves.  \n12.  LGUs themselves incorporate consultation in their activities. LGUs have ensured that \nthey properly consulted all affected persons, including owners of assets and occupants of \nprivate lands affected by right-of-way acquisition and other subprojects development. Individual \nvisits and consultation meetings were conducted. Minutes of the meetings and agreements \nreached were properly documented in the CAP, including the master list of affected persons.  \n6.  Findings and Recommendations \n13.  All proposed subprojects were evaluated and the key findings are set out below. \na.  Revision of Lagtang Site Development Plan to Avoid Significant \nEnvironmental Impacts \n14.  The initial development plans for the Lagtang Upgrading Subproject, as submitted by \nTalisay City to HUDCC, were revised to avoid severe environmental impacts inherent to the \nsubproject locations. The Lagtang subproject site has steep slopes and soil highly vulnerable to \nerosion, necessitating the reduction from 80 to 30 lots. This reduction is based solely on the \nslope limitation that was set for this subproject at 30%. It should be emphasized that this \nthreshold is above the Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM) recommendation. The \nBSWM  classifies  lands  with  greater  than  15%  slope  as  marginally  suitable  for \nhomesite/subdivision  development.  The  higher  slope  threshold  was  set  for  this  subproject \nconsidering  that  there  are  several  existing  houses  that  adopted  practical  erosion  control \ntechniques, allowing them to adapt to the site. These practices include limiting the height of \nstructures, minimizing the cut, and avoiding construction of houses between terraces. Reducing \nand constructing erosion-control devices during house construction will minimize the risk of \nerosion to an acceptable level and will not require further environmental impact assessment. \n15.  Proper mitigation measures to minimize erosion should be integrated in local building \nordinances, particularly for this site. Simple construction procedures, in addition to preventing \nsettlers from residing in areas with more than a 30% slope, should be adopted. This will (i) \nminimize the loss of vegetation; (ii) decrease the slope and its length, and (iii) minimize soil \ndisturbance such as increased pulverization. \nb.  Replacement of the Esperanza Upgrading Subproject  \n16.  Villa Pook Esperanza is a former city dump, and was not properly closed before the site \nwas settled by informal dwellers. This site poses serious environmental risks. Although the \nvolume of waste dumped is relatively small, estimated at 16,188 metric tons, its composition is \nunknown and assumed to contain hazardous waste. Anecdotal information from the settlers \nindicated  that  hospitals  waste  was  dumped  there.  The  poor  load-bearing  capacity  of \nuncompacted municipal waste jeopardizes the structural stability of proposed roads. The main \nrecommendation is to scrape all waste dumped on vacant areas and fill the vacant areas with \nsoil as part of the proposed upgrading. A vacant area within the site will be converted into a \nsmall sanitary landfill where the scraped waste will be transferred. This landfill will subsequently \nbe used as open area consistent with Bacolod City\u2019s land use plan. An environmental impact \nassessment is needed to determine solid waste impacts such as groundwater contamination. \nEsperanza poses significant environmental impacts and was deemed unsuitable as a pilot \nsubproject. \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \n17.  Bacolod Housing Authority (BHA) proposed Purok Riverside as a replacement to the \nEsperanza  subproject.  Pook  Riverside  is  located  along  the  Banago  Creek.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination found no significant environmental impacts related to the subproject, \nbut some small impacts were identified due to the site\u2019s location near an ecologically sensitive \nswamp area. The removal of some mangrove trees is unavoidable. Most significant impacts \nwould occur only during construction: (i) hazards to workers through contact with untreated \nsewage during construction and drain improvement; (ii) dust from earthmoving and from heavy \nequipment exhaust; and (iii) temporary local flooding during backfilling. Mitigation measures \nhave been identified, including (i) education and protective clothing for workers; (ii) operation of \nheavy/noisy equipment only during day time, (iii) informing residents of work schedules; and (iv) \ntemporary bunding of houses and other facilities likely to be inundated. \n18.  A review of Bacolod City\u2019s zoning map indicated that Purok Riverside is classified as a \nresidential area. The DENR-EMB Regional Office informed BHA that the area is not classified \nas environmentally critical or part of the protected areas system.  \nc.  Deferment of the Naga City Triangulo/CBD II Site Development \nSubprojects \n19.  Subprojects in Naga City involve upgrading Triangulo and Central Business District II. It \nhas a similar infrastructure development component requires upgrades footpaths, alleys, roads, \nwater supply, and drains. As previously discussed, these components will have easy-to-manage \nimpacts common to all subprojects. Like Lagtang and Villa Pook Esperanza, the Naga City2 \nsubproject sites include the major development constraint that they are flood-prone. Triangulo is \nabout 180 meters away from the Bicol River, the main drain of the Bicol Basin with headwaters \nin Lakes Buhi, Bato, and Umbao. The subprojects will be of little value to the community unless \nflooding is addressed. This can only be done at the city level, if not at the basin scale, and these \nsubprojects are therefore recommended for deferral until flooding is addressed. \n7.   Conclusions and Recommendations \n20.  The  nature  of  the  proposed  subprojects,  being  community  upgrading  or  new  site \ndevelopment,  will  fundamentally  improve  the  urban  environment  through  improved  access, \nproper  handling  and  disposal  of  domestic  wastewater,  avoidance  of  flood  damage,  and \nprovision of potable water. Also inherent to upgrading subprojects is the dense population at the \nconstruction site, so even simple excavations will have an impact, however small. \n21.  This  Project  emphasizes  the  importance  of  conducting  an  early  environmental \nexamination to allow environmental considerations during subproject site identification, design, \nand feasibility analysis. The findings and recommendations enriched the engineering designs to \nincorporate  simple  mitigation  measures  like  dust  suppression,  timing  of  heavy  equipment \noperation to avoid noise disturbances, proper handling of domestic wastewater and its reuse for \nirrigation. The IEE also pointed out the need to revise the engineering designs to avoid erosion \nand groundwater contamination, and other environmental impacts. \n22.  Local proponents of community upgrading subprojects lack the expertise to conduct \nenvironmental examinations. Although it would be ideal to build the communities\u2019 capability to \nassess environmental impacts, the cost and its limited use at the administrative level do not \n                                                 \n2  In fact, the entire Naga City is flood-prone; based on the Camaligan Flood Gauge Station, 12 serious floods \noccurred in the area during the last 18 years, reaching depths as high as 4.04 meters. \n ", "  Appendix 13  59\nwarrant investment along this line. The capacity-building TA should establish an environmental \nmanagement unit capable of assisting the PMO, LGUs, and communities to undertake IEEs of \nproposed subprojects and to guide them in complying with the Government\u2019s environmental \nregulations and funding agencies\u2019 procedural requirements. \n23.  Local Governments will need to ensure that all subprojects secure an environmental \ncompliance certificate or a certificate of noncoverage from the Environmental Management \nBureau-Department of Environment and Natural Resources (EMB-DENR). Proponents will likely \nbe able to comply with the EMB-DENR environmental impact statement guidelines with few \nchanges to the IEEs. \n \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS) FORM \n  \nA.

Slum upgrading/community empowerment will lead to safer, \nhealthier, and better-organized communities where poverty reduction can be systematically pursued. Greater land security will foster social \nresponsibility/ownership benefits and, through eventual land titling, will offer the beneficiaries with formal lending options. The project will \nalso  involve  various  community-designed  livelihood  improvement  initiatives,  which  may  include  microfinance  development,  cottage \nindustry/trade development, community services, and construction of light infrastructure. Through these initiatives, project beneficiaries will \nbe provided with untapped income sources and the means to maximize their time and existing resources. The project will also directly \naddress the socioeconomic disruption caused by flooding. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nPoverty analysis will be integral to subproject selection/design and will be based on quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Subproject \nselection will include the combined analysis of sector poverty data with country, region, and subproject poverty data and involve poverty \nassessments and stakeholder consultation in the field. Subproject planning/design will entail intensive qualitative analysis, directly involving \nproject beneficiaries through the extensive use of participatory methods to identify the local poor population and provisions to better fit their \nneeds. The poverty impact analysis based on the analysis of pilot subprojects has yielded a poverty impact ratio of 0.6. \nPoverty Classification                                                                                                                                          Core Poverty Intervention \n \nC.
