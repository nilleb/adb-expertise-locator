THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Government of Myanmar (GOM) has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to help finance the Second Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Highway Modernization \nProject (the project).1 The project will support the construction of the 70 kilometer (km) arterial \nhighway network connecting New Bago and Kyaikto, including a 4-lane bridge upon the \nSittaung river. The new highway will (i) improve connectivity between Myanmar and Thailand \nby the deepening the east-west economic corridor (EWEC); (ii) support Myanmar\u2019s economic \ndevelopment, regional economic growth, and international competitiveness by rehabilitating \nrural access roads; and (iii) promote more efficient and safer movement of goods and people \nbetween Bago and Kyaikto, reducing travel time by 50%.  \n \n2.  Aside  from  the 70  km-highway,  other  project  outputs are  (i)  rural  access  roads \ncompleted: rehabilitation or upgrading of low-volume roads providing access to communities \nalong the 70 km-highway; and (ii) enhanced capacity of the Ministry of Construction (MOC): \nfor developing, financing, implementing and managing arterial highway projects, as well as for \nmanaging road safety. It is proposed that the project will be financed with an indicative amount \nof $250 million from concessional ordinary capital resources. The project, for approval in 2020, \nis  included  in  the  Country  Operations  and  Business  Plan:  Myanmar,  2019\u20132021.2 The \nfeasibility study for the project is being prepared through an ADB TA to the GOM (TA 9314).3  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  As described in para 2, the ongoing TA 9314 is currently designing the ensuing project. \nSupplementing this TA 9314, the proposed transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will help \nthe GOM develop a systematic and practical approach for road safety in the GMS EWEC \nBago-Kyaikto existing national highway (90 km). In this process, the TRTA also will help GOM \nestablish an initial foundation for a sustainable and systematic road safety regime, specifically \nwith focus on enhancing MOC capacity for road safety. 4 Since TA 9314, which focuses on \nengineering aspects with respect to road safety design for the project, the TRTA will focus on \nproviding road-user behavior based road safety measures.5  \n \n4.  Myanmar suffers a loss of 1.5% of its gross domestic product annually due to road \ncrashes. Based on the latest available road crash data (2013), Myanmar\u2019s road fatality rate is \nthe third worst in Southeast Asia, at 20 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, which doubled since \n2004. Nearly 60% of road casualties are softer modes: motorcyclists, cyclists, and pedestrians. \nFemale road related fatalities account for 25 percent of the total.6 \n \n5.  The behavior of road users needs to be changed to improve the situation through \neducation on road safety issues and through strengthened enforcement of traffic regulations. \nWhile the government has not formulated a systematic policy response, several road safety \ninitiatives have been undertaken with the support of ADB assistance. These include overview \ndiscussions on Myanmar\u2019s road sector issues and opportunities, specific support for improving \nroad network management and safety with focus on road environment, institutional aspects, \n                                                 \n1  The proposed project was originally titled Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS): East-West Economic Corridor \nHighway Development Project. During the review of the COBP of 2018 (see footnote 2), the government \nrequested the title change to Second Greater Mekong Subregion Highway Modernization Project. \n2  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Myanmar, 2019\u20132021. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Greater Mekong Subregion \nEast\u2013West Economic Corridor Highway Development Project. Manila. \n4  The proposed TRTA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 October 2018. \n5  Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n6  World Health Organization: Global Status Report on Road Safety. 2013. \n ", "2 \ncrash  data  collection,  licensing,  and  road  worthiness  of  vehicles.7 However,  road  user \nbehavior and related road safety issues have not been specifically addressed so far. \n \n6.   To establish a systematic policy response to address road user behavioral issues, the \nfollowing measures have proven to be effective: (i) introduction of school curriculum on road \nsafety;  (ii)  implementation  of  road  safety  programs  for  the  general  public;  (iii)  focused \neducation in driving license schools; (iv) capacity development of police to properly enforce \ntraffic rules and regulations; (v) adequate testing of vehicles worthiness; and (vi) funding.  \n \n7.  Road user learning on road safety typically starts at the childhood level; first through \nparents, then continued in school. This road safety education becomes more solid when \nobtaining a driver\u2019s license, ideally through a driving school\u2019s systematic training. In the \nabsence of such driving schools, systematic training, and loopholes in the licensing system \nallows  candidates  to  obtain  licenses  through  shortcuts.  Unfortunately,  this  applies  to \nenforcement personnel as well, who are currently implementing enforcement activities without \nappropriate capacity, on law, traffic engineering, and mannerly driving. \n \n8.  Further improvements are required on other aspects as well. As regards to road \nengineering, existing high-speed expressways are unsafe with no access control. National \nhighways, with slower traffic speeds though, are similar in nature. All road users share the \nlimited road space without proper segregation. Also, accuracy of road crash data, particularly \nthose complied by the police, need significant improvement to support the effective formulation \nof road safety policies. According to the World Health Organization, about 70% of the crashes \nare unreported and are not included in the crash data compiled by the police. In addition, \npolice crash data reporting sheets need to be streamlined to capture key information on cause \nof crash, and road environment data on crash sites.  \n \n9.   Recognizing the imminent needs, the government has initiated to plan a solid road \nsafety regime. 8 The National Road Safety Council (NRSC) was established in 2017 with the \nparticipation of all key relevant stakeholders including the MOC, Ministry of Transport and \nCommunications (MOTC), National Police, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health etc. At this \ninitial stage, systematic support is required to ensure the efficient function of NRSC to address \nroad safety issues in a sustainable manner. \n \n10.  The TRTA has been designed incorporating positive lessons learned from an ADB \nfinanced  project  in  Cambodia,  which  initiated  ADB\u2019s  first  road  user  behavior  related \nassistance.9 Based on the proven success of this type of activity in improving road safety, the \nTRTA will extend its support to broader activities with the objective of establishing an initial \nfoundation towards a sustainable road safety regime. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n11.  The project\u2019s impact is aligned with an arterial highway network supporting economic \ndevelopment, regional economic growth, and international industrial competitiveness in a way \nthat is safe, environmental-friendly and efficient. It is envisaged that the project will provide \nmore efficient and safer movement of goods and people between Bago and Kyaikto, along the \nGMS EWEC. The TRTA intends to contribute to this outcome by establishing an initial \nfoundation for a systematic approach to remedy road safety issues in Myanmar. The outputs \nof the TRTA aim to remedy behavior-related problems in a systematic manner. It is expected \nthat the success of the TRTA will lead to the replication of similar activities along other arterial \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2017.

Output  1:  Road  safety  approach  for  existing  Bago-Kyaikto  road  section \nestablished. The TRTA will develop a sustainable road safety framework with completion of \ntwo deliverables: development of a safe school zone (SSZ) strategy, and development of a \nsocial enforcement system. The activities will be conducted on the existing Bago-Kyaikto road. \nThis 90-km road section is mostly a two-lane national highway, with a diversity of road users: \npassenger cars, motorcycles, bicycles, 3-wheelers, animal driven carts, trucks, intercity buses, \nfarm vehicles, pedestrians, and animals. Most rural areas along the road are farms with \noccasional restaurants, monasteries, and schools. Each town area along the road stretches \nusually  less  than  500  meters  with  markets,  restaurants,  government  offices,  residential \nbuildings, and commercial buildings.  \n \n13.  The  TRTA  will  reinforce  and  compliment  TA  9314  by  providing  inputs  to  the \nengineering design to improve road safety. For example, the TRTA will identify low cost \nengineering measures including, but not limited to traffic separation and traffic calming \nmeasures, to improve road safety for the Bago-Kyaikto new alignment. In addition, the TRTA \nwill develop a complementary road safety program to be implemented over the life of the \nproject. This program will be informed by stakeholder consensus building and education to \ndevelop a community-based road safety program, including a social enforcement system, and \nSSZs for Bago-Kyaikto existing road. \n \n14.  The TRTA will engage experts to build consensus among all stakeholder groups \n(community leaders, police, men and women, girls and boys in the communities). It will adopt \na targeted approach for the awareness-raising and education activities on road safety. This \napproach will consider gender differences, with interventions being tailor-made for different \ngroups (including targeting drivers on safe and responsible driving behavior). \n \n15.  It is expected that women and girls will actively participate in the activities as key \nstakeholders which include students, teachers (during and after school time) and families. It \nis expected that prominent participants will be mothers of students who are usually involved \nin SSZ implementation as is the case in developed countries. The role of fathers in SSZ will \nalso be explored in this TRTA. To ensure the active participation of women in the TRTA as \ninvaluable stakeholders, particular attention will be paid to avoiding additional burdens on \nwomen through careful meeting arrangements at times and venues convenient for their \nparticipation. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  collect  and  analyze  road  safety  data \nimproved. This output will be achieved by preparing and implementing interim and long-term \nmeasures to improve the collection and analysis of road crash data. Based on the findings of \nthis assessment, capacity building activities will be designed and provided to the Police. To \nbegin, crash data along existing Bago-Kyaikto road will be cross-checked with hospital and \nclinic data for crash casualties/injuries to increase the accuracy of reported police data, the \nMinistry of Construction, the Ministry of Transport and Communication, Ministry of Health, and \nlocal governments. These activities will also include compilation of sex aggregated data \nwherever  relevant  for  better  planning.  Long-term  measures  will  include  comprehensive \ntraining program for concerned officials with advice for improving IT systems.  \n \n17.  Output 3: Police capacity for traffic enforcement enhanced. This output will be \nachieved  by  providing  training  on  appropriate,  simple,  and  effective  enforcement \nmethodologies to enforce traffic rules and regulations. The TRTA will develop a program to \nboth improve the driving skills of police, and to enhance their ability to implement simple but \neffective enforcement techniques, so they can strengthen their enforcement activities.  \n \n ", "4 \n18.  The  TRTA  will  fund  an  international  training  program,  in  Japan,  which  will  be \nsubsequently localized and replicated within Myanmar. To begin, participants (from MOTC, \nMOC, and the National Police) will travel to Japan for a focused training program on road \nsafety. This program will cover Japan\u2019s approach and historical context to road safety, and will \nincorporate field visits to police stations, expressways and national highways and associated \nsafety features, driver learning schools, and SSZs. The TA will provide experts who will \nreplicate the training locally in Yagon, Nay Pyi Taw and Mandalay with a train-the-trainer (TOT) \nactivities. \n \n19.  Output 4: Road safety advisory support established. This output, the TRTA will \nprepare and disseminate materials for: (i) road safety information campaigns; (ii) safety during \nconstruction guidelines; (iii) innovative approaches and general guidelines for urban road \nsafety enforcement; (iv) general guidelines for simulations and dry runs; (v) affordable low-\ncost solution for safety engineering; (vi) guidelines for first aid and other response, and post-\ncrash  victims  support  guidelines,  and  (vii)  NRSC  capacity  enhancement.  Pamphlets, \ninformation  education  communication  (IEC)  materials,  and  flyers  will  be  prepared  with \neffective illustrations for deepening road safety advocacy under this output. All guidelines and \nmaterials will be simplified documents with a maximum of 3 pages, with colored illustrations \ndesigned for easy comprehension and reference, and to be TOT friendly. \n \n20.  All communication materials to be developed under this output (and other outputs of \nthe TRTA) will be targeted and tailor-made for the different stakeholder groups. Such materials \nshall be gender sensitive (no gender stereotypes in content and images) and be based on sex \ndisaggregated analysis and gender related information on behavior and risk. Also, all reports, \nIEC materials, flyers, and manuals produced under the proposed TRTA will receive the \nendorsement of all related government entities prior to finalization. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $1,055,950, of which $999,950 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2.  \n \n22.  The GOM will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, their \nremuneration, per diem, and office accommodation for the TRTA implementation. The GOM \nwas informed that approval of the TRTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  ADB  will  administer  the  TRTA  through  Southeast  Asia  Regional  Department\u2019s \nTransport and Communications Division (SETC). SETC will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants, organize workshops; and provide staff to act as the resource persons in the \nworkshops. \n \n24.
