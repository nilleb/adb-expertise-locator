Local \ncommunities  and  beneficiaries  will  actively  participate  in  the \nselection,  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of all works carried out under the Project.  \n   \nRationale  The tsunami had a devastating impact on the Maldives. Eighty-\nthree  people  are  confirmed  dead  and  another  twenty-five  are \nmissing, feared dead. More than 1,300 people suffered injuries. \nUnlike  other  countries  affected  by  the  tsunami,  the  Maldives \nexperienced a disaster of national proportions. Thirty-nine islands \nwere significantly damaged and nearly a third of the Maldives\u2019 \n300,000  people  were  severely  affected.  About  7%  of  the \npopulation of the Maldives was displaced. Thousands of people \nhad their livelihoods undermined and they will continue to suffer \nunless immediate mitigating measures are taken. Total damage is \nestimated to be about $470 million, close to 62% of GDP. About \n$298 million is direct damages, and the rest is indirect losses. The \ndirect damages amount to about 8% of the replacement cost of \nthe entire national capital stock, estimated to be about $3.8 billion \nat  2004  prices.  The  tourism  sector  suffered  the  largest  direct \ndamages,  with  losses  of  around  $100  million,  followed  by  the \nhousing sector, with losses close to $65 million. \n   ", "ii   \n  The combined impact of the tsunami will reduce GDP growth in \n2005 significantly from the pre-tsunami estimate of 7.5% to 1%. \nThe  impact  on  public  finances  is  likely  to  be  substantial.  The \nbudget  deficit  (including  grants)  is  expected  to  rise  from  a \nprojected 4% of GDP to around 10% of GDP; excluding grants, \nthe deficit would amount to 18% of GDP. There are concerns \nabout the sustainability of the deficit and how it will be financed. \nThe external balance is also expected to worsen. The current \naccount deficit of the balance of payments is expected to worsen \nto about 23% of GDP in 2005, compared with 12% in 2004. It is \nestimated that the financing gap of the balance of payments will \nbe $68 million in 2005. Significant external financing is needed, in \nthe form of grants and concessional loans to the government, as \nwell as private funds, to finance the budget and the widening \ncurrent account deficit of the balance of payments. In undertaking \nadditional  external  liability  for  post-tsunami  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction, the Government of Maldives (the Government) will \nneed to be particularly careful to avoid increasing external debt to \nuncomfortable  levels,  which  could  have  a  negative  impact  on \nfuture growth. External debt (public and private) could rise to 47% \nof GDP in 2005 (from about 42% in 2004). Hence, grants will be \nthe  preferred  mode  of  external  assistance  for  financing  post-\ntsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  the \nsustainability of economic growth by minimizing the devastating \nimpact of the tsunami. To attain this, economic recovery needs to \nbe accelerated through reconstruction of damaged infrastructure \nand restoration of means of livelihood, especially of the poor, in \nthe affected islands.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  two  components  (i)  a  quick-disbursing \ncomponent, and (ii) a project component.  \n   \n  The Quick-Disbursing Component will partially finance the high \nand  unexpected  Government  expenditures  on  tsunami-related \nrehabilitation,  and  reconstruction.  In  accordance  with  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance \nPolicy, the quick-disbursing component of the proposed Project \nwill be used only to finance imports identified as necessary for an \neffective  recovery  program.  The  Government  and  ADB  have \nagreed on a list of imports that can be financed under the quick-\ndisbursing Project facility.  \n   ", "  iii\n  The Project Component will rehabilitate high-priority, tsunami-\ndamaged  infrastructure  and  facilities  by  providing  civil  works, \nequipment and materials, working capital, and consulting services \nfor project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The \nproject  component  will  follow  a  sector  approach  to  selecting \nsubprojects,  based  on  agreed  criteria.  Following  consultations \nwith the Government and development partners, the sectors listed \nbelow have been included in this component. The rehabilitation \nand reconstruction work will be carried out to restore facilities to \npre-tsunami  levels,  or  to  higher,  more  cost-effective  and \nenvironmentally-sustainable standards.  Where necessary, project \ndesigns will include protection measures against future natural \ndisasters. \n   \n  A.  Water Supply, Sanitation and Solid Waste Management. \nThis includes (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure \ndamaged by the tsunami (including sewage systems, networks \nand outfalls), (ii) provision of water and sewage treatment and \ndisposal  facilities  for  displaced  populations  after  the  tsunami \nrendered their islands uninhabitable, and (iii) provision of solid \nwaste management systems and facilities. \n   \n  B.  Transport. This includes (i) rehabilitation and/or reinstatement \nof  damaged  or  destroyed  maritime  navigation  aids, \n(ii) procurement of emergency inter-island transport capacity for \nreconstruction  works,  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  damaged  jetties, \n(iv) repairs to sea walls and quay walls, (v) repairs to causeways, \n(vi)  dredging  of  harbor  basins  and  approach  channels,  and \n(vii) rehabilitation of Mal\u00e9 international airport. \n   \n  C.  Power.  This  includes  rehabilitation  of  the  damaged  power \nsupply  system  and  covers  supply  and  installation  of  new \ngenerators  and  distribution  network,  including  cables  and \ndistribution boxes.  Streetlights will also be installed, if necessary. \nIn bigger islands, with more than one generator, panel boards will \nbe  provided  to  synchronize  operations.  In  islands  where \npowerhouses are badly damaged, new ones will be constructed.  \n   \n  D.  Fisheries.  This  includes  providing  fish  processors  in  128 \nislands with processing equipment, working capital, and extension \nservices.  The capacity of the Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture, \nand Marine Resources (MFAMR) will also be strengthened.  \n   \n  E.  Agriculture. This includes providing affected farmers in the \nperennial and field crop sectors with tools and equipment, and \nworking capital to rehabilitate their farms.  \n   \n ", "iv   \nCost Estimates  The  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $25.3  million  equivalent, \nincluding the quick-disbursing component, which will be entirely in \nforeign exchange. For the project component, the Government will \ncontribute  19%  of  the  estimated  cost  of  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation,  mainly  in  the  form  of  exemption  of  taxes  and \nadministrative support. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a grant of $20 million from the Asian Tsunami \nFund  (ATF)  and  a  loan  of  $1.8  million  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to SDR1,188,000 from its Special Funds resources to \nfinance 86% of the total project cost. This covers the entire foreign \nexchange cost of $16.5 million and $5.3 million equivalent of local \ncurrency cost. \n                                                      \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange Currency  Cost \n  ($ million) \nA.

In  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the loan will \nhave a 40-year, term including a grace period of 10 years, an \ninterest rate of 1% per year, and repayment of principal at 2% per \nannum for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% per \nannum thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2007 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "  v\nExecuting Agencies  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nTreasury  (MOFT).  A  National  Economic  Recovery  and \nReconstruction Program (NERRP) has been created to deal with \n(i) national economic recovery under the MOFT, and (ii) housing \nand infrastructure redevelopment under the Ministry of Planning \nand National Development (MPND). \n   \nImplementation  The  recently  created  NERRP  will  manage  implementation  of \nArrangements  tsunami-related rehabilitation and reconstruction projects. Its tasks \ninclude: (i) planning and implementation of the reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of affected islands; (ii) coordination of the recovery \nof the national economy; and (iii) planning and implementation of \nlong-term  projects  within  the  national  development  framework. \nThe NERRP mainly consists of staff from  MOFT, who  will be \nhandling the economic recovery, and from MPND, who will be \ndealing  with  infrastructure  reconstruction.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented by a centralized PMU to be created under NERRP, \nso  that  the  Government  does  not  need  to  form  a  new  and \nseparate PMU for the Project. MOFT will, however, appoint a \ndedicated  project  manager  to  coordinate  and  oversee  the \nProject\u2019s implementation.  The project manager will be supported \nby five units, under NERRP: (i) planning and programming, (ii) \nprocurement,  (iii)  finance  and  accounting,  (iv)  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  (v)  technical  and  implementation.  The  project \nmanager and the five units will be the project management unit \n(PMU) for the Project. The technical ministries and agencies will \nbe the implementing agencies (IAs).  They will assign staff to the \nPMU's technical and implementation unit, and will be responsible \nfor technical matters relating to their respective sectoral expertise, \nas follows: \n   \n  (i)  Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Environment and \nConstruction  (MEC)  in  the  water  supply,  sanitation  and \nsolid waste management sector; \n(ii)  Ministry of Atolls Development (MOAD), and Ministry of \nTransport  and  Civil  Aviation  (MTCA)  in  the  transport \nsector; \n(iii)  Ministry of  Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine  Resources \n(MFAMR), in the agriculture and fisheries sectors; and \n(iv)  State Electricity Company Limited (STELCO) in the power \nsector. \n   \n  In addition, MOAD will coordinate activities at the atolls level. \n   \n ", "vi   \n  To  ensure  coordination  among  sectors,  the  Government  will \nestablish a project coordinating committee (PCC). The PCC will \nbe co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and Treasury and the \nMinister  of  Planning  and  National  Development,  or  their \ndesignates, and will include high-level representatives from MPND \nand  the  IAs,  as  well  as  the  Ministry  of  Gender,  Family \nDevelopment and Social Security, and the Department of External \nResources. The PCC will provide guidance to the PMU on policy \nmatters,  and  will  decide  on  the  selection  of  high-priority \nsubprojects proposed by the PMU. The PMU will be responsible \nfor (i) consolidating subproject proposals from the implementing \nagencies to be submitted for approval by the PCC; (ii) preparing \nbidding documents and conducting procurement of civil works, \nequipment,  goods,  and  related  services  for  infrastructure \nreconstruction; (iii) recommending the release of funds for working \ncapital  to  the  affected  communities;  (iv)  disbursing  funds  and \naccounting,  including  preparing  the  financial  reports;  and \n(v) preparing and submitting progress reports to PCC and ADB.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s funds will be disbursed through subaccounts under \nthe Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction Fund (TRRF), created by \nthe Government, to (i) ensure transparency and harmonization, (ii) \navoid  duplication  of  effort,  and  (iii)  reduce  administrative \noverheads.  The  TRRF  will  follow  international  accounting \nstandards,  and  will  have  a  financial  management  system  to \naccount and report for project resources and expenditures. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, services and works will be carried out in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  \nProcurement  will  be  expedited  to  meet  the  contemplated \nimplementation  schedule.  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  providing \nreconstruction assistance after disasters provide for flexibility, so \nthat project activities can start promptly. Local procurement will be \nthe preferred mode for all civil works because of the relatively \nshort implementation period, the small size of contract packages, \nand the wide geographic spread of the project sites. Community \nparticipation will be encouraged. The flexibility provided in ADB\u2019s \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy will be used where \napplicable. Prior review by ADB of invitations for bids and bidding \ndocuments shall be required for procurement under international \ncompetitive bidding procedures.  For  international  shopping   and \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procurement,  post  facto  approval \nprocedures will be followed. However, if ADB does not approve \nthe award or terms of the contract, the Government will not use \ngrant funds to finance the contract. If grant funds have been used, \nthe Government will refund to ADB any such payments. ", "  vii\n  The procurement of goods, related services, and works through \ninternational  shopping,  local  competitive  bidding,  and  other \nprocurement methods shall follow the government\u2019s procedures \nand  bidding  documents  established  for  TRRF  and  found \nacceptable to ADB. Initial scrutiny indicates that the government\u2019s \nexisting procedures and bidding documents are broadly in line \nwith ADB\u2019s requirements. \n   \nConsulting Services  Given the tight implementation schedule and the limited capacity \nof IAs, consulting services will be required to assist the PMU in \n(i) prioritization of subprojects; (ii) technical survey and detailed \ndesign  of  subprojects;  (iii)  preparation  of  cost  estimates; \n(iv) preparation  of  subproject  proposals  in  accordance  with \nselection  criteria  agreed  between  ADB  and  the  Government; \n(v) supervision and monitoring of works to ensure quality control \nand transparency among contractors and communities carrying \nout smaller works; and (vi) oversight of works in each sector or \nsubsector  and  provision  of  detailed  accounting,  auditing,  and \nreporting to PCC and ADB. The Project will require a total of 27 \nperson-months of international and 63 person-months of domestic \nconsultants. Consultants will be engaged by ADB, in consultation \nwith the Government, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor the engagement of domestic consultants. Since the Project will \nbe  completed  within  24  months,  ADB  has  agreed  with  the \nGovernment that direct engagement of individual consultants be \nundertaken, as provided for under the guidelines.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  contribute  to  ongoing  Government  efforts  in \nBeneficiaries  economic recovery; public infrastructure and utilities rehabilitation; \nlivelihood and employment generation; and promotion of social \ncohesion. It will help restore access to public infrastructure and \nservices. It will help to maintain clean living conditions through \ncommunity-based  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste \nmanagement programs. The Project will also help re-establish lost \nagricultural  and  fishing  incomes  through  livelihood  programs \ntargeted  at  workers  in  the  agricultural  and  fisheries  sectors, \nespecially   women   who   engage   in   home  gardening  and fish \n  processing. Interventions proposed within each sector will help \nrestore  the  livelihoods  of  many  tsunami-affected  and  internally \ndisplaced people. The priority given to providing unskilled work to \naffected  people,  including  women,  will  be  an  important \nintervention for people who cannot re-establish their livelihoods \nand  are  living  in  temporary  shelters.  The  Project  will  help  to \nrestore the confidence and self-dignity of people and communities \nadversely affected by the tsunami. \n   \n ", "viii  \nRisks and Assumptions  A  potential  risk  is  that,  despite  the  Government\u2019s  strong \ncommitment, implementation could be hampered by slow approval \nprocedures  and  lack  of  adequate  capacity  in  the  IAs.  The \nGovernment  has  streamlined  the  approval  procedures  for  all \nprojects, and a PCC will be established to ensure coordination \namong sectors during implementation. The PCC will have high-\nlevel  political  and  administrative  representation.  It  will  provide \nguidance  to  the  centralized  PMU  on  policy  matters,  and \nspecifically will decide on the selection of high-priority subprojects \nproposed  by  the  PMU.  The  selected  IAs  have  considerable \nexperience  in  implementing  ADB-financed  projects  and  are \nfamiliar with ADB procedures. Specialized consultancy inputs will \nprovide additional implementation assistance to the PMU and the \nIAs. \n \n  Governance-related  issues,  including  corruption,  constitute \nanother risk. They are addressed by detailed subproject selection \ncriteria, transparent implementation and monitoring mechanisms, \nand specific financial controls, including regular as well as random \naudits.  These  will  include  strict  construction  supervision  and \nadequate  consultant  support,  and  close  monitoring  by  ADB\u2019s \nExtended  Mission  (EM)  and  Headquarters  staff.  Random \nprocurement and annual performance auditing at the executing \nagency (EA) level will also be carried out. A dedicated project \nmanager  will  assist  in  selection  and  implementation  of \nsubprojects. In addition, the Government will involve community-\nbased  organizations  (CBOs),  island  development  committees \n(IDCs), and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in monitoring \nproject implementation. Consultants and the PMU will determine \nspecific  monitoring  indicators  for  outputs  of  sectors  and \nsubprojects.  The  Government  will  establish  a  grievance \nmechanism to give tsunami-affected people an opportunity to be \nheard and to submit any complaints related to ADB\u2019s proposed \nassistance.  For  this  purpose,      facilitation      units      will      be  \nestablished   to   assist individuals and communities   to   access  \ngoods  and  services  financed  under  the  Project,  or  other \nassistance for tsunami-affected people. Such facilitation units will \nbe established in collaboration with CBOs and NGOs. The PMU \nwill also publicly disclose information on project procurement on \nthe website for the Project. The website will provide information on \nfinancial statements, bidding procedures, bidders, and contract \nawards for the Project. ADB\u2019s EM staff and consultants will help to \ncreate the website. Checks and balances will be maintained by \nconsultants, who, in addition to providing specialized inputs into \nthe design of subprojects, will conduct random spot checks during \nthe Project implementation and provide capacity building inputs in \nsuch areas as monitoring and evaluation. \n   \n \n \n ", "  ix\n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nand loan to the Republic of the Maldives for the Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project (the \nProject)  to  partially  reconstruct  damaged  infrastructure  and  restore  livelihoods  that  were \nseverely affected by the tsunami that struck the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. The \nDesign and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Impact of the Tsunami on the Maldives \n2.  The tsunami traveled at over 700 kilometers per hour and reached the Maldives at 09:20 \nin the morning of 26 December 2004. Tidal waves ranging from 4 to 14 feet were reported in all \nparts of the country. More than 1,300 people were injured, 83 people are confirmed dead and \nanother  25  are  missing,  feared  dead.  Unlike  other  countries  affected  by  the  tsunami,  the \nMaldives experienced a disaster of national proportions. Thirty-nine islands were significantly \ndamaged and nearly a third of the Maldives\u2019 300,000 people were severely affected. Fourteen \nislands  were  completely  destroyed  and  evacuated.  More  than  12,500  people  have  been \ndisplaced from their islands, and another 8,500 have been temporarily relocated within their own \nislands. About 7% of the population of the Maldives was displaced. The force of the waves \ncaused widespread devastation of shelter and infrastructure in the atolls. Flooding wiped out \nelectricity on many islands, simultaneously destroying communication links. Water supply was \ndisrupted in about 15% of islands and 18% had major damage to essential infrastructure, such \nas the jetties and harbors, that links them to Mal\u00e9. The electricity supply in many affected \nislands has yet to be restored. The impact on an economy dependent largely on tourism, \nfisheries,  and  agriculture  has  been  significant.  The  livelihoods  of  thousands  have  been \nundermined and they will continue to suffer unless immediate mitigating measures are taken. \nB.  The Government's Immediate Response \n3.  The Government of the Maldives (the Government) acted quickly, and an impressive \nrelief and rehabilitation operation was put in place with support from UN agencies, NGOs, and \nother development partners. The President of the Maldives declared a state of national disaster \nand appeals were made for international assistance. A National Disaster Management Centre \n(NDMC)  was  established  to  expedite  and  facilitate  coordination  of  rescue  and  relief.  The \nMinistry of Defense (MOD) is coordinating the overall relief effort, while the Ministry of Finance \nand  Treasury  (MOFT)  is  coordinating  donor  assistance.  The  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nDevelopment (MPND) is coordinating data gathering and long-term responses.  \n \n4.  Communication was restored on 11 atolls within 24 hours of the tsunami and relief \nsupplies were dispatched from 27 December 2004. Communities mobilized in support of their \nneighbors and the private sector also contributed to the relief effort.  \n \nC.  Needs Assessment \n5.  The Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 28 December 2004 for \nemergency assistance for relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in response to the damage \ncaused by the tsunami. In consultation with the Government, ADB, the World Bank, and the UN \nformed a team to undertake a needs assessment. The assessment began on 5 January 2005, \nand an interim report was presented to the Government on 17 January 2005. The report was ", "2 \nrevised based on comments received from the Government and other development partners. \nThe Government endorsed the findings of the report on 15 February 2005 (the full needs \nassessment report is in Supplementary Appendix A and a summary is in Appendix 2).  \n \nD.  Estimated Reconstruction Costs and Financing Requirements \n6.  Total damages are estimated to be about $470 million, close to 62% of GDP. About \n$298 million is direct damages, and the rest is indirect losses. The cost of direct damages \namount to about 8% of the replacement cost of the entire national capital stock, estimated at \naround $3.8 billion at 2004 prices. The tourism sector suffered the largest direct damages, with \nlosses of $100 million, followed by the housing sector with losses close to $65 million. The \nlargest indirect losses also occurred in the tourism sector, which has seen a sharp drop in \ntourist arrivals. \n7.  Reconstruction costs are higher than total losses for some sectors (e.g. housing).  This \nis because of the need to rebuild to higher standards to reduce vulnerability and because \ncurrent construction or environmental standards are higher than when the original facilities were \nbuilt. Some indirect losses cannot be recovered: production losses from fishing and agriculture, \nand  tourism  cancellations  cannot  be  restored.  There  are  both  short-term  and  long-term \nfinancing needs. The short-term needs reflect investments needed urgently within the next 6 \nmonths; the long-term needs cover the period from 6 months to 3 years. The overall financing \nneeds for the next 3 years are expected to be $406 million; of this, $120 million will be needed \nwithin the next 6 months i.e. in first half of 2005 (Appendix 2, Table A2.1). \nE.  Macroeconomic Impact \n8.  The tsunami has severely affected key economic sectors, including tourism, fisheries, \nagriculture, and essential infrastructure, including water supply, sanitation and power.  The \nimpact on these sectors will spill over into other sectors. The tsunami will decelerate GDP \ngrowth substantially. Economic growth forecasts for 2005 have been revised downwards from \nthe pre-tsunami estimate of 7.5% to 1%. The impact of the tsunami on public finances is likely to \nbe substantial. The budget deficit (including grants) is expected to rise from a projected 4% of \nGDP to around 10% of GDP. The budget deficit, excluding grants, will amount to 18% of GDP. \nThere are concerns about the sustainability of the deficit and how it will be financed. Given the \nlimited maneuvering space for the government as a result of deficit spending in the recent past, \na lack of finance could constrain reconstruction spending. The balance of payments is expected \nto deteriorate because of a slowdown in the tourism industry and the imports needed for \nreconstruction.  However,  increases  in  official  transfers  and  remittances  may  mitigate  this \nsomewhat. Overall, the current account deficit of the balance of payments is expected to rise \nsharply to about 23% of GDP from 12% in 2004. The financing gap of the balance of payments \nis estimated at $68 million in 2005 after adjusting for a substantial increase in expected external \nassistance. Additional external financing is needed, in the form of grants and concessional loans \nto the Government, as well as more private funds, to finance the budget and the widening \ncurrent account deficit of the balance of payments. \n \n9.  The  terms  under  which  external  finance  is  available  will  determine  the  pace  of \nreconstruction. It needs to be emphasized that, in undertaking post-tsunami rehabilitation and \nreconstruction, the Government will need to be particularly careful not to run up its external debt \nto uncomfortable levels, which could affect future growth prospects. It is anticipated that the \nprivate sector will increase foreign borrowing, in order to finance the liquidity of banks and the \nreconstruction of resorts. This could raise total external debt sharply. Hence, to the extent ", "3 \npossible, grants will be the preferred mode of external assistance for financing post-tsunami \nrehabilitation and reconstruction (for the macroeconomic impact see Appendix 3). \n \nF.  National Recovery and Reconstruction Plan \n10.  The Government has recently prepared a National Recovery and Reconstruction Plan \n(NRRP).1 The NRRP outlines the projects and programs required to meet the immediate needs \nfor housing and infrastructure, reviving livelihoods, and creating the conditions for sustained \neconomic recovery. The priorities and objectives for recovery and reconstruction are: (i) disaster \nrelief (to help survivors cope with the immediate aftermath of the disaster); (ii) macroeconomic \nrecovery and livelihood revival (to restore community livelihoods, revive key economic sectors, \nand maintain macroeconomic stability); (iii) community empowerment (to rebuild lives with local \nownership);  (iv)  environmental  protection  (to  protect  and  regenerate  vulnerable  marine \necosystems, strengthen disaster preparedness, and mitigation measures); and (v) restoration of \npublic services (so everyone has access to basic services). \n \n11.  The NRRP has identified provision of emergency shelter to the displaced population as \nthe most important priority. The economic recovery plan is based on a stable and sustainable \nmacroeconomic framework, and aims to revive the tourism and fisheries sectors in the shortest \npossible time. In the event of resettlement because of the tsunami, the NRRP categorically \nstates that such resettlement will be demand-driven and voluntary. The NRRP also emphasizes \nthe need to rebuild infrastructure in the 104 most affected islands. These include schools, \nhospitals, coastal structures, transportation and communication infrastructure, water supply and \nsewerage, solid waste disposal systems, and electricity. The NRRP also supports establishment \nof stronger disaster mitigation measures, and protection of the environment. It proposes an \ninvestment program of $375 million in 13 sectors. The document also contains a sector based \nResults  and  Resource  Framework.  Prioritization  of  projects  within  sectors  has  yet  to  be \ncompleted. \n \nG.  Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction Fund \n12.  The Government has set up a Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction Fund (TRRF) under \nthe Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). The TRRF has been established to manage \nexternal financial assistance received for the tsunami relief and reconstruction effort. The TRRF \nwill operate as a separate fund and will enable the Government to disburse funds transparently \nand to account for tsunami-related assistance. The Government\u2019s objectives in establishing the \nTRRF are to: (i) significantly reduce delays in making funds available at the operational level; \n(ii) enable timely disbursement of funds; (iii) replenish the account quickly to maintain program \nmomentum;  and  (iv)  increase  the  speed,  accuracy  and  transparency  of  reporting.  The \nGovernment  has  asked  external  funding  agencies  to  provide  as  much  of  their  funding  as \npossible through the TRRF to: (i) ensure transparency; (ii) eliminate duplication of efforts; and \n(iii) reduce administrative overheads. \n \n13.  Total commitments reported by the Government as of end February 2005 are around \n$61.6 million, of which $25.7 million has been received. The Government anticipates that all \ntsunami-related reconstruction assistance will be managed under the TRRF.

National Recovery and \nReconstruction Plan. Mal\u00e9.   \n ", "4 \nkind receipts as of end February 2005 amount to about $68 million (about 62% in kind and 38% \nin cash).2 \n \n14.  The TRRF will expend funds for relief, recovery, and reconstruction work to address the \nobjectives set by the Government and external funding agencies.3 A monitoring board chaired \nby the Auditor General of the Maldives, and consisting of representatives from the Government, \nthe private sector, and external funding agencies, will monitor and supervise utilization of funds. \nThe TRRF will be administered by the MOFT. The Government is committed to ensuring that a \nTRRF  accounting  system,  developed  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  is \nestablished as soon as possible.4 The Government has already taken steps to implement an off-\nthe-shelf accounting software package, and has developed a draft TRRF operations manual \n(OM).  The  draft  OM  outlines  the  TRRF  management,  administrative  structure,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  and  provides  guidelines  for  TRRF\u2019s  financial  management \nfunctions.  These functions include: (i) activity and project evaluation, appraisal, and approval; \n(ii) flow of funds; (iii) accounting and financial reporting standards; and (iv) audit arrangements. \nTRRF procurement guidelines are also being prepared. Guidelines are based upon the existing \ngovernment financial and procurement regulations, and the Government is in the process of \nstrengthening financial and internal controls to ensure that the special needs of the TRRF are \naddressed. The World Bank and ADB have reviewed the OM and their recommendations are \nbeing incorporated.  \n \nH.  Social, Poverty, Environment, and Livelihood Impact \n15.  Social Impact. The social fabric of the tsunami-hit islands has been seriously affected \nby the extensive physical damage, loss of life and livelihoods, and displacement of people. Most \naffected people lost savings kept in cash in the house. The affected communities are now more \nvulnerable to poverty. Although traumatized, island communities have demonstrated a strong \nsense of independence, resilience and cohesion in mobilizing themselves into groups to remove \nrubble, initiate small-scale reconstruction activities, distribute relief supplies, and shelter those \nmade homeless. In a country of many small islands, community organizations have traditionally \nplayed an important role in providing public and collective services. The capacity of communities \nto mobilize themselves will be an important asset for the reconstruction work ahead. Community \nmobilization and self-help will be a cornerstone and organizing principle for demand-driven local \nrecovery programs. The planned reconstruction activities will be made socially more cohesive \nby taking into account the special needs of women, whose livelihoods have been especially \naffected by the tsunami. Livelihood recovery interventions need to support women\u2019s income \ngeneration. Post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction programs also offer an opportunity to \nenhance the capacities of government departments and island communities in planning and \nimplementing the recovery effort.  \n                                                 \n2  Separate records are maintained for aid received in kind. The inventory of supplies received and supplies issued is \nperiodically updated. Physical and administrative controls are maintained by the National Security Service (NSS). \nThe NSS has been mandated to monitor and control the movement of in-kind aid by controlling warehousing and \ntransportation arrangements.  Controls in place include intake registries, requisition slips, release slips, periodic \ninventory counts, and segregation of duties. \n3  Appendix 5 describes Government arrangements for the TRRF: its management structure; staffing; financing plan; \nfunds flow arrangements; accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements; and monitoring and evaluation \narrangements.  \n4  The Government has already initiated a number of steps to strengthen its accounting system including as a result \nof dialogue with ADB linked to Loan 1915 (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of the Maldives for the Strengthening of the Public Accounting \nSystem Project. Manila). This process will continue and will be further accelerated once implementation of the loan \nbegins.  ", "5 \n16.  Displacement.  Some  people  have  moved  to  other  islands,  either  temporarily  or \npermanently. While most affected people will return to their original islands, some communities \nwill be resettled either out of choice (the community wants to move to a larger or safer island) or \nout  of  necessity  (the  home  island  has  been  completely  destroyed,  submerged,  or  made \nuninhabitable). The government has clearly stated that nobody will be forced to relocate against \ntheir wishes. \n17.  Poverty. The tsunami may lead to an increase in poverty as a result of exacerbated \nregional disparities, magnified gender differences, and an increase in migration to Mal\u00e9. An \nestimated 70% of the population outside of Mal\u00e9 has an income equivalent to the poorest 20% \nin Mal\u00e9. Almost 52% of the affected population is female. The vulnerability of the poor has \nincreased  in  the  post-tsunami  period  because  of  (i)  the  unclean  environment  and  the \nconsequent risk of disease; (ii) the damaged maritime and air infrastructure, limiting safe travel; \n(iii) destruction of public utilities and discontinued power supply; and (iv) destroyed livelihoods in \nagriculture and fisheries. Poor and disadvantaged households, especially those headed by \nwomen,  are  particularly  affected  by  these  shocks  and  face  a  risk  of  becoming  further \nmarginalized. \n18.  Environment. Even more than most island nations, the Maldives is highly dependent on \nthe  fragile  ecosystem  of  its  coral  reef  islands.  The  tsunami  has  generated  a  range  of \nenvironmental  problems  with  the  potential  to  harm  human  health.  It  caused  widespread \ndeposition of coral sand, vegetation, municipal waste from dump sites, health care waste, \nhuman excreta from damaged septic tanks, hazardous substances (oils, asbestos, batteries, \netc.) and demolition waste (concrete, coral fragments, timber, etc.) from destroyed buildings \nacross the impacted islands. It resulted in saltwater intrusion into fresh water sources on almost \nall of the 1,200 islands, causing vegetation to go brown and die. It is likely that the coral reefs \naround some islands have been damaged by sedimentation and excessive amounts of debris. \nIn addition, the tsunami resulted in beach and soil erosion.  \n19.  Safety  Nets,  Employment,  and  Livelihoods.  The  tsunami  has  created  a  new \nvulnerable group; people who lost their houses, other assets, and livelihoods. How quickly they \nrecover depends critically on the amount, speed, and efficiency of targeted public support for \nemployment creation and livelihood restoration.  As a step in this direction, the Government has \nlaunched the Island Livelihood Revitalization and Development Program. This program provides \n(i) in-kind equipment (e.g. fishing equipment, fish-processing equipment, start-up packages \ncontaining seeds and tools for agriculture); (ii) small and short-term cash grants for working \ncapital; (iii) subsidized microcredit for agricultural and other producers; (iv) financing for repairs \nto fishing vessels; and (v) procurement of new cost-effective fishing vessels to replace those \nthat were lost. At the same time, the Government recognizes that some affected households \nmay not be able to benefit from such livelihood assistance, and will need targeted interventions. \nIn the very short term, the main need is to provide shelter and income support to displaced \npeople and the Government has disbursed Rf30 million ($2.3 million) to the affected population \nunder an emergency cash transfer program.5 The program is continuing and it is estimated that \nan additional Rf20 million ($1.6 million) will be disbursed shortly. It is estimated this program will \nreach 63,000 people.6 The Ministry of Gender, Family Development, and Social Security has \n                                                 \n5  Under the program, Rf1,500 ($117) per family member is disbursed to people who have completely lost their \nhouses; Rf1,000 ($78) per person to people whose houses were damaged and need repairs; and Rf500 ($39) per \nfamily member to people whose houses were flooded and therefore lost their belongings. \n6  Multisectoral teams from Mal\u00e9, together with island committees, identified the beneficiaries, registered them, and \ndisbursed the assistance as a one-time cash transfer. The government is aware that not all affected have yet been \nserved, and efforts are ongoing to cover all the affected. \n ", "6 \nproposed a follow-up income support program for affected individuals not covered by livelihood \nrestoration programs, such as the elderly, and people with disabilities.7 Restoration of damaged \nhousing and other infrastructure, such as island offices and courts, will provide an opportunity \nfor short-term employment.  \nI.  National Disaster Risk Management \n20.  The recent disaster has increased Government awareness of the risk exposure of the \nMaldives and the measures needed to manage that risk. The Government is preparing a risk-\nmanagement strategy to reduce the human and economic impact of future disasters. The three \npillars of risk management are risk information, risk mitigation, and risk transfer.  \n21.  The first pillar, risk information, aims to increase the understanding of risk, based on an \nassessment of vulnerability. The Government plans to participate in a regional warning system \nand develop a national communications program to inform island representatives and local \ncommunities. Preparedness planning would be put in place for first response and emergency \nrelief and a broadband communications network is planned.  Updated information, based on a \ncomprehensive risk mapping, would be made available to the population.  \n22.  The second pillar, risk mitigation, includes structural and nonstructural measures. The \nnonstructural measures include changes to the legal and regulatory system, particularly with \nregard to land use planning and the building code, so the reconstruction process can lead to a \nreduction in risk. Land use plans would incorporate risk mapping information to reflect different \nlevels of risks in the zoning. The building code would introduce construction requirements to \nlimit the vulnerability of the built environment. Risk mitigation needs to be complemented by the \nidentification of shelters, and the construction, or adaptation, of multipurpose shelters. \n23.  The third pillar, risk transfer, would attempt to distribute risk among the Government, \nhouseholds, and insurance companies. Sectors such as tourism, fisheries, and banking, in \nparticular, could benefit from insurance against risk. \nJ.  Response of Development Partners \n24.  The United Nations Office of Coordination and Humanitarian Assistance deployed a UN \nDisaster Assessment and Coordination team to the Maldives the day after the tsunami hit, to \nprovide technical assistance for disaster assessment and the management and coordination of \ndisaster response. UNDP and other UN agencies rapidly approved and released more than \n$400,000 of immediate emergency funds and other in-kind support. On 6 January 2005, the UN \nsystem launched an appeal for $65 million for the Maldives. Less than half the target has been \nmet, with the shelter and livelihood components of the appeal largely unfunded. \n \n25.  The World Bank has extended emergency post-tsunami support in the form of quick- \ndisbursing  emergency  assistance.  The  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  has \nprovided credit of $14 million, of which $2 million would be new money. The rest would come \nfrom loan cancellations and savings. The World Bank expects to provide 40% of its emergency \nsupport in the form of grants. It will support safety-net cash transfers, grants to small businesses \nto restore their assets and livelihoods, education sector reconstruction, and technical skills for \n                                                 \n7 This new proposed scheme would give Rf500 ($39) per month per person for a period of 10 months, confined to a \nselect target group of around 20,000 individuals, with total cost Rf10 million ($780,000). Free health care might also \nbe provided.  \n ", "7 \nprogram management. The World Bank\u2019s IDA credit will be channeled through the TRRF. A \nfurther $12 million in IDA assistance is expected in FY2006 from IDA XIV resources. The \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved $6.3 million in emergency assistance to help \nthe Government deal with the devastating effect of the tsunami.8 In addition, the Government of \nJapan has extended a $20 million grant for post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction, of \nwhich $10 million will be for housing, $5 million for livelihood support (agriculture, fisheries, and \nsmall businesses), and $5 million of which has yet to be allocated. The International Federation \nof the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has committed a little over $10 million to build \n500 houses. The Croix-Rouge Fran\u00e7aise (French Red Cross) has committed $10 million for \nhousing. \n \nK.  Lessons in Disaster Management \n26.  ADB has not provided disaster emergency assistance to the Maldives before. This will \nbe only the second project developed under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy \n(May 2004);9 the first being the Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project in Bangladesh \nthat was approved in January 2005. Some general lessons can nevertheless be drawn based \non the experience of other developing member countries (DMCs), most notably of Bangladesh, \nwhere ADB has provided eight postdisaster loans.10 The general lessons are that (i) projects \nmust  be  prepared  as  quickly  as  possible;  (ii)  they  should  focus  on  restoring  facilities; \n(iii) rehabilitation  works,  to  the  extent  possible,  should  be  completed  within  2  years; \n(iv) implementation will place a heavy burden on executing agency staff and, therefore, strong \nconsulting support and ADB supervision will be needed during implementation; and (v) efforts \nshould be made to ensure that ADB\u2019s rapid response to disasters is matched by equally quick \naction by the Government.  \n \n27.  Other lessons learned from ADB\u2019s earlier emergency projects are that (i) beneficiary \nparticipation is important and should be increased in project preparation and implementation, \nespecially  in  the  maintenance  of  facilities;  (ii)  environment  and  social  aspects need  to  be \nconsidered during implementation, even though the need for a rapid response may not permit \ndetailed treatment before approval; (iii) arrangements for disbursements, including retroactive \nfinancing and the use of imprest accounts, should give the executing agency quick and simple \naccess to funds; (iv) project objectives and scope need to be carefully defined; and (v) criteria \nfor  subproject  selection  should  permit  simple  prioritization  of  subprojects  and  short \nimplementation periods. In addition, anticorruption measures need to be addressed even in \nemergency projects. These lessons have been considered and incorporated in the design of the \nproposed Project for Maldives. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n28.  The main objective of the Project is to contribute to the sustainability of economic growth \nby minimizing the devastating impact of the tsunami. To attain this objective, economic recovery \n                                                 \n8  IMF\u2019s emergency assistance will be repaid in eight quarterly installments over 3\u00bc to 5 years from the disbursement \ndate, with a subsidized charge of 0.5% per annum. \n9  ADB. 2004.

The  Project  will  focus  on  priority  areas,  identified  through  consultation  with  the \nGovernment, the private sector, NGOs, and civil society. The design and implementation of \nsubprojects  will  involve  community  participation.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  public \ninfrastructure, and adopt appropriate design standards in the water supply, sanitation, solid \nwaste management, power, and transport sectors. In addition, the Project will restore livelihoods \nin the fisheries and agriculture sectors. \n \n30.  The Project has been developed in close cooperation with the World Bank and the UN, \nboth of which are closely involved in the post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in \nthe Maldives.11 The choice of sectors and the project design is based on the findings and \nrecommendations of the joint needs assessment. Close coordination between the agencies and \nthe Government has been maintained throughout the processing of the Project. ADB and the \nWorld Bank plan to field an extended mission (EM) in Mal\u00e9 to improve implementation and \ncoordination with the Government and other development partners. \n \n31.  Members of the project team visited various affected islands, examined the damage, and \nheld discussions with affected people and local communities.12 The field visits were particularly \nuseful in determining the scope and form of the Project. The design of the Project draws upon \nADB\u2019s significant experience in delivering emergency assistance in DMCs over the last two \ndecades. The Project complements relief and other assistance provided by the Government, UN \nagencies, NGOs, bilateral development partners, and the World Bank.  \n \n32.  The Project is consistent with the Maldives\u2019 medium-term objectives as expressed in the \n6th National Development Plan, covering 2001-2005, and the long-term Vision 2020. It is also in \nline with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for the Maldives, which prioritizes improvements \nto physical and social infrastructure to support pro-poor growth and poverty reduction in the \nouter islands and atolls. ADB\u2019s current and future assistance will focus on improvements to the \nwater supply, sanitation, solid waste management, domestic maritime transport, outer islands \nelectrification, employment skills training, and SME development. In the post-tsunami period, \nADB programs will continue to focus on promoting economic diversification and employment by \nproviding basic economic, public and social infrastructure in the atolls. The Project is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.13 \n  \nB.  Main Features of the Proposed Project \n33.  Composition of the Project. The proposed Project will combine a grant from the Asian \nTsunami Fund (ATF) and a loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.  \n \n34.  Grant. In view of the severe macroeconomic impact of the tsunami, and the large \nfinancing gap in the fiscal and external accounts of the Maldives, the Project will have a grant \ncomponent  of  $20  million  from  the  ATF  in  order  to  meet  immediate  and  medium-term \nrehabilitation and reconstruction requirements. The grant funds from the ATF will not finance \n                                                 \n11 Discussions were also held with bilateral donors, Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), \nCanadian International Development Agency (CIDA), UK Department for International Development (DFID), and \nUS Agency for International Development (USAid), in Colombo in early March on the Project. \n12 Members of the project team visited Maafushi Island, South Mal\u00e9 Atoll, Guraidhoo Island, South Mal\u00e9 Atoll and \nKolhufushi and Naalaafushi in  Meemu Atoll. \n13  ADB. 2004.

When formulating the Project, the Government\u2019s capacity, the possibility for loan \nportfolio  restructuring,  and  the  potential  use  of  loan  savings  from  six  ongoing  loans  were \ncarefully assessed in line with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.  Based on this \nassessment, the Government requested ADB to cancel the surplus loan proceeds of three \nprojects.14 The Government has formally recommended to ADB that the cancelled $1.8 million \nin surplus loan funds from these projects be reallocated to the Project and it is proposed that \nthis be done.  \n \n36.  Size of the Project. The Project would thus total $21.8 million, and would consist of a \n$20 million grant and a $1.8 million loan from Special Funds Resources.  \n \n37.  Other ADB Assistance. In addition, ADB will separately process grant assistance of \n$1 million from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) in order to restore the livelihoods \nof tsunami-affected farmers in the Maldives. This project will enable farmers in the 26 worst \naffected agricultural communities to restart their livelihoods. ADB is also processing a $250,000 \nproject from its Poverty and Environment Program (PEP) on Saving the Tsunami-Affected Trees \nin the Maldives. An advisory technical assistance (TA) for $400,000 from the Poverty Reduction \nFund (PRF) on Promoting Sound Environmental Management in the Aftermath of the Tsunami \nDisaster is also being processed.   \n \nC.

The Government requested that, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, a portion of the proposed Project be used for \nquick-disbursing assistance to partially finance the unusually high and unexpected expenditures \non rehabilitation and reconstruction. Since the World Bank is also providing quick-disbursing \nassistance, it is proposed that ADB\u2019s Project extend $6.5 million in quick-disbursing assistance \n($4.7 million of grants and a $1.8 million loan from Special Funds resources). In accordance \nwith the requirement of ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the quick- disbursing \ncomponent will be used only to finance imports identified as necessary for an effective recovery \nprogram. The Government and ADB have agreed on a list of permissible imports for financing \nunder the quick-disbursing Project facility (Appendix 4). \n \n39.  Project Component. The project component will be $15.3 million and will be grant- \nfinanced.  It  will  be  used  to  rehabilitate  high-priority,  tsunami-damaged  infrastructure  and \nfacilities by providing civil works, equipment and materials, working capital, and consulting \nservices for project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. During the rehabilitation \nphase, appropriate and cost-effective design standards will be adopted, while simultaneously \ntaking into account that project designs attempt to incorporate disaster resistant parameters. \nThe Project will follow a sector approach in selecting the highest-priority subprojects during \nimplementation. This will allow a quick response and maximum flexibility in both geographic \ncoverage and selection of components, within an agreed framework and criteria. In consultation \nwith  the  Government,  and  taking  into  account  the  assistance  being  proposed  by  other \n                                                 \n14 (i) ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan for \nPost Secondary Development Education Project ($0.2 million); (ii) ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan for Regional Development ($1.2 million); and (iii) ADB. \n2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Director on a Proposed Loan for Employment \nSkills Training Project ($0.4 million). \n ", "10 \ndevelopment partners, the project component will finance rehabilitation and reconstruction in the \nfollowing sectors: (i) water supply, sanitation and solid waste management ($4.0 million); (ii) \ntransport ($2.9 million); (iii) power ($2.5 million); (iv) fisheries ($2.6 million); and (v) agriculture \n($2.5 million). Consulting services for project design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation \nwill be $0.8 million. \n \nD.  Sector Assistance and Outputs \n40.  Water  Supply,  Sanitation  and  Solid  Waste  Management.  The  water  supply  and \nsanitation sector was seriously affected as a result of the tsunami. Water supply and basic \nsanitation  infrastructure  and  services  urgently  need  to  be  replaced,  rehabilitated,  or \nreconstructed. Introduction of solid waste management systems and restructuring of the sector \nare needed to cope with the damage and debris. The joint needs assessment estimated that \n$45.6 million would be needed to rehabilitate the sector. Damage includes loss of infrastructure \nfor water supply, household and communal rainwater tanks; damage to roof water harvesting \npiping and gutter systems; and loss of pumps and sewerage networks, including 6,000 pour-\nflush latrines and septic tanks and an estimated 126 kilometers (km) of small-bore sewers and \n2.4 km of sea outfall.  \n \n41.  This component will rehabilitate and provide water supply, sanitation and solid waste \nmanagement infrastructure and services for the 69 most affected communities.  Rehabilitation \nworks will be carried out to restore facilities to pre-tsunami levels or to higher, cost-effective, and \nenvironmentally acceptable standards. In the short term, critical equipment will be procured for \n(i) immediate provision of safe water to affected areas through community and household \nrainwater tanks and rainwater harvesting equipment; (ii) provision of basic temporary sanitation \nfacilities and rehabilitation of existing sanitation infrastructure, including desludging systems and \nsludge drying beds; (iii) provision of solid waste management equipment (including communal \nbins, composters, compactors, cutters), and (iv) training for clearing and recovery of debris. In \nthe medium term, (i) environmental infrastructure (including sewage systems, networks and \noutfalls) will be rehabilitated and reconstructed; (ii) water and sewage treatment and disposal \nfacilities for displaced populations will be provided; and (iii) solid waste management systems \nand facilities will be provided (Appendix 6).  \n \n42.  Transport.  Based  on  figures  from  142  tsunami-affected  islands,  and  following \ndiscussions with relevant ministries, the joint needs assessment report estimated the cost of \nreconstruction for the transport sector to be $24.9 million. The report estimated that about one \nthird of navigation aids were damaged or destroyed and 36 jetties were damaged. About 4,200 \nmeters (m) of quay walls, and 15,000 m of harbor/sea walls and breakwaters have been \ndamaged or destroyed, and dredging will be required to remove about 370,000 m3 of silt from \nharbor basins and approach channels. Five causeways, which are very important for inter-island \nconnections, have been partly damaged. There has been some damage to Mal\u00e9\u2019s commercial \nharbor and international airport, part of which will be covered by insurance. However, for safety \nreasons, the airport requires short-term repair work on the airfield, drainage works, sea wall \ndefenses, navigation equipment, and communications. \n \n43.  The transport project component comprises: (i) rehabilitation and/or reinstatement of \nmaritime navigation aids that have been damaged or destroyed; (ii) procurement of emergency \ninter-island transport capacity for reconstruction works; (iii) rehabilitation of damaged jetties; (iv) \nrepairs to sea walls and quay walls; (v) repairs to causeways; (vi) dredging of harbor basins and \napproach channels; and (vii) rehabilitation of the Mal\u00e9 International Airport. Rehabilitation works \nwill be carried out to restore facilities to pre-tsunami levels or to a higher standard as considered ", "11 \ncost-effective in the long run, and, where appropriate, will include coastal protection measures \nto mitigate damage from future natural disasters (Appendix 7). \n  \n44.  Power. The tsunami completely disrupted the power supply system in at least 95 islands \n(about 48% of the islands with electricity) and left the population without electricity for days \nbefore the first teams arrived to restore temporary electric power. The needs assessment \nestimated the damage and the recovery needs of the power sector to be $4.6 million. The \ntsunami damaged 24 powerhouses, 104 generators with capacities ranging from 20 to 150 \nkilowatts (kW), 34 switchboards, more than 121 km of cables of various sizes, 632 distribution \nboxes, and 652 streetlights. \n \n45.  The project component includes rehabilitation of the damaged power supply system. \nThis will consist of supply and installation of new generators and distribution networks, including \ncables and distribution boxes. Streetlights will be installed if necessary. In bigger islands, with \nmore than one generator, panel boards will be provided to synchronize operations. In islands \nwhere the powerhouse was badly damaged, new powerhouses will be constructed. Restoring \nconnections to households will include installation of new meters and consumer panels. This \nwork will restore facilities to pre-tsunami levels or to a higher disaster-resistant standard if this is \nmore cost-effective in the long run (Appendix 8). \n \n46.  Fisheries. According to estimates by the Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture, and Marine \nResources (MFAMR), the total cost for repair and rehabilitation of the fisheries industry will be \nabout $25 million.15 This covers repair and/or replacement of fishing vessels, engines, fishing \ngear and accessories, fish processing equipment, and infrastructure. Immediate assistance is \nneeded by the fisheries sector to replace equipment and utensils lost by fish processors. The \nMFAMR has identified 128 islands where fish processors have been severely affected and the \nProject aims to support the fish processors by providing them with processing equipment, \nworking capital, and extension services and by strengthening the MFAMR. ADB\u2019s assistance is \nproposed to be $2.6 million, of which about 70% would be for equipment and basic inputs, about \n10%  for  working  capital,  and  the  balance  for  consultant  services,  training,  extension,  and \nadministrative support. \n \n47.  The MFAMR, in conjunction with affected fish processors, will select, in a participatory \nmanner, community-based organizations (CBOs) or island development centers (IDCs), who will \nbe responsible for delivering Project inputs and working capital to the affected fish processors. \nThe Project will provide CBOs or IDCs with training so they can provide efficient services to fish \nprocessors (Appendix 9). \n \n48.  Agriculture. The agriculture sector has been badly hit, as the tsunami waves caused \ntemporary, semi-permanent, or permanent damage to soil and water. Destruction to standing \ncrops, arable land and groundwater, loss of farming equipment, and damage to agriculture \ninfrastructure have been substantial. Declines in production and yield levels of field and other \ncrops,  including  homestead  cultivation  such  as  breadfruit,  mango  and  other  fruit  trees,  is \nsignificant.  The  needs  assessment  estimated  total  losses  to  be  about  $11.1  million.  The \nMFAMR has identified 42 islands where field crops were affected by the tsunami, and 26 islands \nwhere perennials and fruit trees were severely affected. The Project aims to support affected \nfarmers in the perennial and field crop sectors by providing them with farm inputs, tools and \nequipment, and working capital in order to rehabilitate their farms and restore their livelihoods. \n                                                 \n15 The joint needs assessment has estimated a lower figure of $14.1 million, which MFAMR regards as an \nunderestimate. \n ", "12 \nADB\u2019s assistance is proposed to be $2.5 million, of which about 70% would be for equipment \nand basic inputs, about 10% for working capital, and the balance for consultant services, \ntraining, extension, and administrative support.  \n \n49.  MFAMR, in conjunction with affected fish processors, will select CBOs or IDCs to deliver \nproject inputs and working capital to the affected farmers. MFAMR will verify the targeted \nfarmers with assistance from atoll offices. In order to ensure effective use of project inputs, \nMFAMR will provide extension services to farmers through the three mobile extension service \nteams, who will identify the contaminated soil and water conditions in the islands and provide \nsuitable cultivation methods. Consultant services will be provided to strengthen the institutional \ncapacity of MFAMR and CBOs and IDCs (Appendix 10). \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n50.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $25.3  million  equivalent,  including  the  quick-\ndisbursing component, which will be entirely in foreign exchange. For the project component, \nthe Government will contribute 19% of the estimated cost of reconstruction and rehabilitation, \nmainly in the form of tax exemption and administrative support. Since a sector approach is \nbeing followed, the cost estimates are broken down by sectors (Table 1 and Appendixes 6 to \n10). \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency   Cost \n       \nA.

The Government has requested for a grant of $20 million from the Asian Tsunami Fund. \nIn  addition,  the  Government  has  requested  for  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR1,188,000 ($1.8 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the \nProject. The loan will have a 40-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate \nof 1% per annum, and repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the \ngrace  period  and  4%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  grant  and  loan  proceeds  for  the  project \ncomponent of the Project will be made available to the IAs through budgetary allocations.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n52.  Soon after the tsunami, the Government established a National Disaster Management \nCenter (NDMC). The NDMC has been functioning as a central agency for (i) collecting and \nupdating data on damage, and (ii) coordinating the Government\u2019s relief efforts with support from \ninternational community. About 1 month after the disaster, on 31 January 2005, the Government \nadopted a long-term framework for the NDMC. It was considered important to continue the work \nof NDMC without interruption, but reorganize its work into two areas. The functions of NDMC \nwill be assigned to a newly created National Economic Recovery and Reconstruction Program \n(NERRP). \n \n53.  Under this arrangement, NERRP's tasks will include (i) planning and implementation of \nthe reconstruction and rehabilitation of affected islands, (ii) coordinating the recovery of the \nnational economy, and (iii) planning and implementation of long-term projects within the national \ndevelopment framework. The NERRP consists of staff from MOFT (who will be handling the \neconomic  recovery)  and  MPND  (who  will  be  dealing  with  housing  and  infrastructure \nreconstruction), and staff from other ministries. MOFT will be the executing agency of the \nProject, while its implementation will be centralized in the NERRP.  \n \n54.  The Project will be implemented by a centralized project management unit (PMU) to be \ncreated under NERRP, so that the Government does not need to form a new and separate unit. \nMOFT  will,  however,  appoint  a  dedicated  project  manager  to  coordinate  and  oversee \nimplementation,  who  will  be  supported  by  five  sections  under  NERRP  (planning  and \nprogramming, procurement, financial and accounting, monitoring and evaluation, and technical \nand implementation). The project manager and the NERRP\u2019s five existing sections will be the \nPMU of the Project. The technical ministries and agencies will be the implementing agencies of \nthe Project. They will assign their staff to the PMU under the technical and implementation \nsection, and will be responsible for addressing technical matters in their respective areas of \nexpertise, as follows: \n \n(i)  Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Environment and Construction (MEC) in \nthe water supply, sanitation and solid waste management sector; \n ", "14 \n \n(ii)  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development  (MOAD),  and  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil \nAviation (MTCA) in the transport sector; \n \n(iii)  Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources (MFAMR), in agriculture \nand fisheries sectors; and \n \n(iv)  State Electricity Company Limited (STELCO) in power sector. \n \n55.  In addition, MOAD will support co-ordination of activities at the atolls level. \n \n56.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  consolidating  subproject  proposals  from \nimplementing agencies and submitting them for approval by the project coordinating committee \n(PCC, see below); (ii) preparing bidding documents and procuring civil works, equipment, goods \nand related services for infrastructure reconstruction; (iii) recommending the release of grant \nfunds under working capital schemes to the affected communities; (iv) disbursing funds and \ncarrying  out  accounting,  including  preparing  financial  reports;  (v)  preparing  and  submitting \nprogress  reports  to  PCC  and  ADB;  and  (vi)  maintaining  the  website  for  the  Project.  The \nGovernment has agreed to establish the PMU and to appoint the project manager and key PMU \nstaff by end-March 2005. \n \n57.  To ensure coordination, the PCC will be co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and \nTreasury and the Minister of Planning and National Development or their respective designates, \nand will include high-level representatives from MPND and the implementing agencies, as well \nas from the Ministry of Gender, Family Development and Social Security and the Department of \nExternal Resources. The PCC will guide the PMU on policy matters, and select high-priority \nsubprojects proposed by the PMU. The PCC will meet as needed but not less than once every \nthree months. The Project organization structure is in Appendix 12. \n \n58.  As part of the joint needs assessment, and in preparation for IDA credit and grant \nsupport,  the  World  Bank  has  completed  a  financial  management  assessment  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Tsunami  Relief  and  Reconstruction \nProgram (TRRP); and the TRRF, through which the Government proposes to route all TRRP \nfunds.  Based  on  the  assessment\u2019s  recommendations,  the  Government  is  finalizing \nimplementation arrangements in order to ensure transparency and efficient fiduciary controls. A \nsound financial management system, incorporating financial arrangements, control processes, \nand funds flow arrangements, is a requirement of the TRRP, and is being established and \ndocumented in the TRRF operations manual. Thus, while it is recognized that public financial \nmanagement and accountability in the Maldives is at a relatively early stage, there is a strong \nunderstanding and commitment within the Government to modernize.  Important steps have \nalready been taken to ensure that the financial management arrangements for the TRRP and \nthe TRRF are able to account for project resources and reporting of project expenditures. \n \n59.  Project  Monitoring  and  Anticorruption  Measures.  ADB\u2019s  EM  staff,  project \nconsultants,  and  periodic  review  missions  will  closely  monitor  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements to ensure quality control, expeditious implementation of subprojects, and rapid \nassistance to MOFT on project implementation matters. The EM staff, consultants, and review \nmissions will also closely monitor anticorruption measures undertaken by the PCC and PMU, \ncarry out random checks on procurement, and on accounts of the Project and subprojects, and \ninspect facilities rehabilitated by the Project. The anticorruption measures adopted under the \nProject include (i) strict financial management with strengthened Government monitoring and ", "15 \nindependent monitoring by consultants; (ii) the use of detailed subproject selection criteria; \n(iii) strong  project  supervision  with  appropriate  consultancy  input;  (iv)  regular  independent \nperformance auditing; and (v) random spot checks by EM staff, consultants, and ADB review \nmissions.  \n \n60.  In addition, the Government will involve CBOs, IDCs, and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) in monitoring project implementation. Consultants and the PMU will determine specific \nmonitoring indicators for outputs of sectors and subprojects. The Government will establish a \ngrievance mechanism within the existing Public Complaints Bureau to give tsunami-affected \npeople an opportunity to be heard and an opportunity to submit their complaints related to \nADB\u2019s proposed assistance. Facilitation units will be established on each affected island to help \nindividuals and communities to access goods and services financed under the Project, or other \nassistance. These units will be established in collaboration with CBOs and NGOs. The PMU will \nalso publicly disclose information on procurement on the website for the Project. The website \nwill  provide  information  on  financial  statements,  bidding  procedures,  bidders,  and  contract \nawards for the Project as well as the list of goods and services purchased and their intended \nand actual utilization. ADB\u2019s EM staff and consultants will help to create and maintain such a \nwebsite. \n \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n61.  The implementing agencies, through the PMU, will propose a list of subprojects. The \nPMU will screen proposals and submit them to PCC for final selection. The Government and \nADB have agreed that each subproject must satisfy the following criteria.  \n \n(i)  It  should  rehabilitate  or  restore  tsunami-damaged  infrastructure  and  facilities \nbased  on  the  needs  assessment,  and  will  exclude  relief  work  and  projects \naddressing long-term development needs.  \n \n(ii)  It should be technically feasible and represent a least-cost alternative.  It should \nbe financially viable, sustainable, and cost-effective, and incorporates disaster \nresistant features, where necessary and feasible; \n \n(iii)  It should, to the extent possible, involve local communities and beneficiaries in \nthe selection, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) as \nmuch as possible.  \n \n(iv)  It can be completed within the project implementation period.  \n \n(v)  It should not be financed by another agency.  \n \n(vi)  It should have a direct social and economic impact (subprojects will be prioritized \non this basis).  Priority will also be given to subprojects that rehabilitate ongoing \nor completed ADB financed projects.  \n \n(vii)  It  should  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  and  the  agreed  environmental  assessment \nframework.  For  subprojects  that  require  an  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE),  the  IEE  should  be  included  in  the  subproject  proposal,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s environment clearance should be obtained before the contract is \n ", "16 \nawarded. Any project deemed by ADB to be environmentally an \u2018A\u2019 category will \nnot be eligible for ADB financing.   \n \n(viii)  It  should  avoid  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  If, however,  \neither  is  unavoidable  in  the  course  of  the  Project,  it  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  agreed  resettlement  framework \n(Appendix 18) before the award of the subproject contract. \n \n62.  Subproject proposals will be prepared by the PMU in a format to be agreed by the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  the  preparation,  submission, \nimplementation, and benefits monitoring and evaluation. The first subproject for each sector will \nbe subject to prior review and approval by ADB before they begin. Each subsequent subproject \ncosting more than $500,000 equivalent will be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval. \nThe procedures for selection, approval, and implementation are in Appendix 13. \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n63.  As the Project is for emergency assistance, it will be implemented expeditiously after \napproval and completed in 24 months. For selected subprojects, performance indicators and \ntime-bound completion schedules will be determined by the PMU in consultation with project \nconsultants and EM staff. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 14. \n \n4.  Procurement \n64.  Procurement of goods, services and works will be consistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement, yet carried out expediently in order to meet the contemplated implementation \nschedule. ADB\u2019s procedures for providing reconstruction assistance after disasters allow for \nconsiderable flexibility, so project activities can start promptly. Local procurement will be the \npreferred mode for all civil works because of the relatively short implementation period, the \nsmall  size  of  contract  packages,  and  the  wide  geographic  spread  of  the  project  sites. \nCommunity participation in procurement will be encouraged. \n \n65.  The procurement of goods and services, including equipment and materials, will follow \ninternational competitive bidding procedures when the estimated contract cost is more than \n$1 million equivalent, and international shopping when the estimated contract cost is up to \n$1 million equivalent. Bidding periods of 7\u201315 days for international shopping are acceptable. \nProcurement of goods and services below $100,000 may be undertaken by direct purchase, \nallowing for 3\u20135 days for submission of quotations. The procurement of commodities in bulk \nshall be undertaken under normal competitive commercial practices appropriate to the trade, \nand acceptable to ADB.  Contracts for such specific commodities shall not exceed $1 million. \n \n66.  None of the Project\u2019s individual civil works contracts is expected to exceed $3 million. \nHowever, if contract packages are enlarged, civil works contracts with estimated values greater \nthan $3 million will be procured in accordance with international competitive bidding procedures. \nContracts with estimated values of $3 million or less will be procured in accordance with local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, and with bidding periods of 21\u201330 days.  \nSmall and simple civil works, estimated to cost $500,000 or less, may have a 15-day bidding \nperiod.  Pre-qualification  or  a  registration  system  (for  local  contractors)  will  be  used  as \nincorporated into the Government\u2019s procurement procedures and documents. To encourage \ncommunities  to  participate  and  the  use  of  domestic  materials,  community  participation  in ", "17 \nprocurement will be pilot tested in the transport, fisheries and agriculture sectors.  Small works \ncontracts with estimated costs of $50,000 or less may be awarded to community groups or \norganizations, in accordance with practices and procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n67.  The procurement of goods, related services, and works through international shopping, \nlocal  competitive  bidding,  and  other  procurement  methods  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s \nprocurement procedures established for TRRF, if acceptable to ADB. Initial scrutiny suggests \nthat the Government\u2019s existing procedures and bidding documents are broadly in line with \nADB\u2019s requirements.16 For international shopping, local competitive bidding, direct purchase, \nand commodity procurements, post facto approval procedures will be followed. However, if ADB \ndoes not approve the award or terms of the contract, the Government will not use grant funds to \nfinance the contract. If the grant funds have been used, the Government will refund to ADB any \nsuch payments. \n \n68.  Prior review by ADB of invitations for bids and bidding documents shall be required for \nprocurement under international competitive bidding procedures. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n69.  Given the tight implementation schedule and the capacity of IAs, consulting services will \nbe needed to help the PMU to (i) prioritize subprojects; (ii) carry out technical surveys and \ndetailed designs; (iii) prepare cost estimates; (iv) prepare subproject proposals in accordance \nwith Government and ADB requirements and selection criteria; and (v) supervise and monitor \nworks to ensure quality control and transparency among contractors and communities carrying \nout  smaller  works.  The  Project  will  require  a  total  of  27  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and 63 person-months of domestic consultants (outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 15). \n \n70.  The Government has agreed that all consultants will be engaged by ADB, in consultation \nwith the Government, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Since  the \nProject will be completed within 24 months, expeditious selection and fielding of the consultants \nwill be necessary. Accordingly, ADB has agreed with the Government that direct engagement of \nindividual  consultants  be  undertaken,  as  provided  for  under  these  guidelines.  General \nconditions for direct engagement under the Project require that the consultant (i) be currently \nengaged or have prior substantial and satisfactory experience in previous ADB or World-Bank-\nfinanced damage rehabilitation; and (ii) have been selected for ongoing or previous projects \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  have  performed  satisfactorily \npursuant to the terms of such prior engagements. These arrangements provide for efficient \nrecruitment of consultants under the circumstances. \n \n6.  Advance Action \n71.  Given the urgency of the Project, ADB has approved advance action for the procurement \nof goods, services and works, provided this has taken place on or after 1 January 2005. The \n                                                 \n16  ADB recommended adjustments to available bidding documents such as (i) addition of a \u201ccorrupt practices\u201d clause \nin all bidding documents, and the waiving of performance securities only for works contracts below $500,000 in the \nbidding documents for works, and (ii) in bidder qualification evaluation, removal of the restrictive practice of giving \npreference to contractors with 40% local labor, and inclusion of a list of eligible countries, as foreign firms are \nallowed to participate in ADB\u2019s local competitive bidding. \n ", "18 \nGovernment was advised that approval of such advance action did not commit ADB to finance \nany part of the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n72.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  expeditious \ndisbursements are key to effective and timely emergency assistance.  Immediately after the \ngrant and loan have become effective, the Government will establish three imprest accounts \nunder the TRRF. Two imprest accounts will be deposited with quick disbursing component of \nTEAP:  (i)  Account  1\u2013$4.7  million  (grant);  and  (ii)  Account  2\u2013$1.8  million  (Special  Fund \nResources loan). In addition, the third imprest account (Account 3) will be deposited with the \nproject component of TEAP\u2013$2.9 million (grant). The imprest accounts will be established, \noperated, and maintained in accordance with the Operations Manual of the TRRF and ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest accounts shall be checking accounts, which will \nfacilitate withdrawal of funds to meet project expenditures whenever needed. Interest income \nearned  from  the  imprest  accounts,  if  any,  shall  be  refunded  to  ADB.  ADB's  statement  of \nexpenditures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances to the \nimprest accounts, applicable to contracts amounting to $1.0 million or less for the importation of \ncommodities in bulk and contracts amounting to $100,000 or less for the other importations and \nproject expenditures. \n8.  Retroactive Financing \n73.  The Project provides for retroactive financing of immediate imports and rehabilitation of \nkey infrastructure and facilities. ADB has agreed to provide retroactive financing of up to 30% of \nthe quick-disbursing and project component of the Project (except  consulting services) for \neligible expenditures incurred not earlier than 1 January 2005, provided that the expenditures \nare procured in accordance with agreed procedures. The Government has been advised that \nprovision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \n9.  Accounts, Audit, and Reports \na.  Accounts and Audit \n74.  The PMU will maintain separate records and accounts for each project component.  \nThese accounts will be adequate to identify the goods and services financed by grant and loan \nproceeds, the financing source, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. The accounts will \nbe set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. Consolidated project accounts and \nrelated financial statements will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB. The \naudited reports and related financial statements in English will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \n \n75.  All project activities will be subject to independent performance audits to ensure their \ntransparency and to provide an objective and independent assessment. The performance audit \nwill be conducted annually and randomly during project implementation, and will be carried out \nby external auditors selected by the Government in consultation with ADB. In addition, ADB will \nconduct project procurement audits during implementation as part of its regular reviews. ADB \nalso  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  a  \u201cspecial  audit\u201d  focusing  on  governance,  financial \naccountability (e.g. certification of accounts), and transparency soon after completion of the \nProject. \n ", "19 \nb.  Reports \n76.  The PMU will prepare brief progress statements and submit these to PCC and ADB at \nthe end of each month. In addition, the PMU will submit quarterly reports to PCC and ADB. \nWithin 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will provide ADB through \nPCC an overall project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of project design, \ncosts, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details as \nrequested by ADB. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n77.  The PMU will carry out project performance monitoring and evaluation in accordance \nwith baseline indicators and monitoring targets, which will be developed for each sector and \nsubproject  before  implementation  for  monitoring  purposes  as  well  as  for  checking  against \nselection criteria.  \n \n11.  Project Review \n78.  ADB will conduct regular reviews (at least once every 6 months) throughout project \nimplementation. Given the relatively short implementation period and emergency nature of the \nProject, no midterm review will be conducted, unless deemed necessary by ADB and the \nGovernment. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits and Financial Sustainability \n79.  The selected subprojects will be technically feasible, cost-effective, and will represent \nleast-cost alternatives.  If it is appropriate, they will upgrade the infrastructure so that similar \ncatastrophes can be withstood and environmental standards can be met. A rapid economic \nassessment was undertaken based on available data and simplified assumptions for each \nProject  component\u2014water  supply  and  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  transport, \npower; fisheries and agriculture.  The Project\u2019s weighted average economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is estimated to be 19%. \n \n80.  A broad assessment of financial viability and sustainability of each project component \nhas been made, based on available data and simplified assumptions.  During implementation, \nthe PMU and the PCC will evaluate the financial sustainability of the subprojects by ensuring \nthat the Government has sufficient resources to meet future recurrent costs. The ADF loan \nfunds  will  not  represent  a  significant  debt  burden  for  the  Government,  since  they  are \nreallocations  of  loan  savings  from  ongoing  projects,  which  had  been  factored  in  by  the \nGovernment in its debt service commitments.  The funds will be channeled through TRRF, for \nwhich adequate fiduciary controls will be established, and ADB subprojects will be screened by \nthe PMU and PCC. This will ensure that the funds will be used for the intended purposes and \nthat Project benefits will be realized.  \n \nB.  Poverty and Other Impacts \n81.  Poverty Impact. The Project will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts to regenerate \nthe economy, rehabilitate the public infrastructure and public utilities, generate livelihoods and \nemployment, and create social cohesion. It will help restore access to public infrastructure and \n ", "20 \nservices. It will help to maintain clean living conditions through community-based water supply, \nsanitation and solid waste management programs. The Project will also help re-establish lost \nagricultural and fishing incomes through livelihood programs targeted at agricultural and fishing \nindividuals,  especially  women  who  engage  in  home  gardening  and  fish  processing.  The \ninterventions proposed within each sector will help restore the livelihoods of many tsunami-\naffected  and  internally  displaced  people.  The  priority  given  to  providing  unskilled  work  to \naffected people, including women, will be an important intervention for people who cannot re-\nestablish their livelihoods and are living in temporary shelters. The Project will help to restore \nthe confidence and dignity of people and communities affected by the tsunami. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16.   \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts \n82.  The Project is classified as category B, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002).17 An IEE was conducted to identify potential impacts. It showed that no significant \nadverse environmental impacts were foreseen and therefore a full-scale environmental impact \nassessment was unlikely to be required. The IEE focused on potential impacts associated with \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of maritime transport and protection structures, rehabilitation of \ncommunity  power  supply  schemes  and  community  electrification  services,  sewage  and \nsanitation  systems,  solid  waste  management,  and  the  provision  of  working  capital  for \ncommunity  fish  processing  and  island  agriculture.  While  some  components  will  make  an \nimmediate contribution to the natural and human environment, others will be carefully designed \nand implemented to ensure no significant adverse impacts are associated with them. The \nagencies  involved  in  the  Project  are  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and \nprocedures. Subproject selection and implementation will follow the environmental assessment \nand review procedures prepared for this Project. The summary IEE is in Appendix 17. \n \nD.  Resettlement Issues \n83.  The tsunami displaced more than 12,500 people from their islands and destroyed more \nthan 4,000 houses. Homeless people are living temporarily in makeshift public shelters or with \nrelatives and host families. The Government's policy on \"resettlement of population displaced or \naffected by the Tsunami\" stresses that the relocation of displaced households will be a voluntary \nprocess which will be carried out in consultation and agreement with the households as well as \ntheir  host  communities,  if  any.  It  emphasizes  that  Government  will  inform  all  relocating \nhouseholds of their entitlements: compensation for damaged houses and lost assets, relocation \nallowance, transitional support and development assistance, and access to \u2018socioeconomic \nservices and utilities\u2019. On an island that is habitable and safe after the tsunami, each internally \ndisplaced household will receive compensation for its lost dwelling and other structures to \nenable them to be reconstructed or repaired at their original location. If the original location is \nseverely eroded or difficult to reclaim, the household will receive a new plot of land on the same \nisland to construct its house and other structures. Alternatively, the household may apply for \npermanent resettlement on a \u201dfocus/safe\u201d island. Applications for such permanent resettlement \nmay be made by an individual household or an entire island community. Households that are \nliving temporarily on \u2018safe\u2019 islands after the tsunami may apply for permanent resettlement on \n\u201dfocus/safe\u201d islands. These islands will become self-reliant in emergency management, with an \nearly warning system, well-built jetties and harbors, and improved communications facilities. \nThey will be regional centers where economic growth is expected. On islands made unsafe by \nthe tsunami, each household will be encouraged, but not forced, to relocate to a \u201cfocus/safe\u201d \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. ", "21 \nisland. If households decide to continue to live on an unsafe island or want to return from a \ntemporary \u2018safe\u2019 island to their original island even though it is unsafe, the Government will \nrebuild the basic infrastructure and other facilities on such islands, and will help people to \nreconstruct  their  houses  and  other  structures.  Each  displaced  household  will  receive  a \n\u201dresettlement entitlement\u201d before relocation \u201dwhich would be an agreed lump sum amount of \nmoney\u201d  in  addition  to  compensation  for  lost  assets,  assistance  to  find  housing  sites  or \nagricultural sites, transitional support and development assistance such as land preparation, \ncredit facilities, training or employment opportunities.  \n \n84.  The Project will help to restore damaged transport infrastructure and facilities, water \nsupply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  power  and  fisheries  infrastructure  and \nagricultural lands. Most rehabilitation and restoration work will take place where the original \ninfrastructure is located, so emergency rehabilitation works are unlikely to generate significant \nresettlement.  However,  if  any  subproject  activity  triggers  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguards, MOFT will formulate an appropriate resettlement plan in consultation with affected \nhouseholds and in accordance with the agreed resettlement framework (Appendix 18), and \nsubmit it to ADB for review and approval before awarding civil contracts.  \n \nE.  Risks \n85.  A potential risk is that, despite strong Government commitment, implementation could be \nhampered by slow approval procedures and lack of adequate capacity in the implementing \nagencies. Time-consuming approval procedures and slow implementation are the two main \nconcerns. Based on detailed discussions with the Government, ADB\u2019s assessment is that the \nGovernment is strongly committed to the timely and effective completion of the Project. The \nGovernment has streamlined approval procedures for all projects related to reconstruction and \neconomic  recovery.  Furthermore,  to  ensure  coordination,  a  project  coordinating  committee \n(PCC) will be established. The PCC will have the highest level of political commitment and will \nbe co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and Treasury and the Minister of Planning and National \nDevelopment or their respective designates, and will include high-level representatives from \nMPND and the implementing agencies, as well as the Ministry of Gender, Family Development \nand Social Security and Department of External Resources. The PCC will provide guidance to \nthe PMU on policy matters, and will select high-priority subprojects proposed by the PMU. The \nselected IAs have considerable experience in implementing ADB-financed projects and are \nfamiliar  with  ADB  procedures.  Specialized  consultancy  inputs  will  provide  additional \nimplementation assistance to the PMU and the IAs. The Government\u2019s contribution to the \nProject will be in the form of exemption of taxes and duties, and administrative support during \nthe 2-year implementation period of the Project.  \n \n86.  Governance-related issues, including corruption, constitute another risk. These issues \nwill be addressed by detailed subproject selection criteria, transparent implementation and \nmonitoring mechanisms, and specific financial controls, including regular and random audits. \nThese will include strict construction supervision and consultant support and close monitoring by \nthe EM and ADB headquarters staff. Random procurement and annual performance auditing at \nthe executing agency level will also be carried out. In addition, the newly established NERRP \nwill have specialized units to deal specifically with planning and programming; finance and \naccounting; procurement; technical issues and implementation; and monitoring and evaluation. \nA project manager will help to select and implement subprojects. The Government will establish \na grievance mechanism to give tsunami-affected people an opportunity to be heard and submit \nany complaints related to ADB\u2019s proposed assistance. Facilitation units will be established to \nhelp individuals and communities to access goods and services under the Project or benefit \n ", "22 \nfrom other assistance available for tsunami-affected people. The units will be established in \ncollaboration  with  CBOs  and  NGOs.  The  PMU  will  also  publicly  disclose  information  on \nprocurement for the Project and NERRP will establish a website with information on financial \nstatements, bidding procedures, bidders, and contract awards. Checks and balances will also \nbe maintained by consultants, who, in addition to providing specialized input into design of \nsubprojects, will also conduct random checks during the Project\u2019s implementation and help to \nprovide capacity in areas such as monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the Government will \ninvolve  CBOs,  IDCs,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  monitoring  project \nimplementation.  To  facilitate  this,  consultants  and  PMU  will  determine  specific  monitoring \nindicators for outputs of sectors and subprojects.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n87.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:     \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that immediately after grant and loan effectiveness, \na centralized PMU will have been created and a full time Project Manager will \nhave been appointed.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all \nsubprojects are properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  cash  and  in-kind  assistance  provided  to \nindividual beneficiaries under the Project will be against suitable identification \nand verification in accordance with arrangements agreed between ADB and the \nGovernment. All records, receipts, certificates and other documents related to the \ncash and in-kind assistance will be properly maintained and made available to \nADB at any time. \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that the Executing Agency and each IA will actively \nseek community participation in the selection, design, and implementation of all \nworks carried out under the Project. The Government will ensure that CBOs, \nIDCs and NGOs are involved in project monitoring. \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigation measures in \naccordance with (a) the Government\u2019s environmental regulations and (b) ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  are  incorporated  into  all  subproject  designs  and \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  agreed  environmental \nassessment framework is implemented; that any subproject for which an IEE is \nrequired includes such an IEE in the subproject proposal; and that a subproject \nfor  which  Government  environmental  clearance  is  required  obtains  such \nclearance prior to the award of any contracts for that subproject.  \n   \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that the relocation of the displaced persons will be \ncompleted as per the Government\u2019s policy framework and procedural guidelines \napplicable  to  the  Project,  which  are  outlined  in  the  agreed  Resettlement \nFramework. ", "23 \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent possible, subprojects will avoid \ninvoluntary resettlement. In the event involuntary resettlement is required for any \nsubproject,  then  the  Government  will  prepare  a  Resettlement  Plan  (RP)  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995)18 and the agreed Resettlement Framework; \nand submit it to ADB for review and approval before resettlement is initiated. The \nRPs  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  persons  and  project  reporting  will  provide \ninformation on resettlement. \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand  Development  (1998),19  (a)  project  interventions  take  into  account  the \ndifferent impacts and needs of women and men; (b) special features are built into \nsubprojects  to  facilitate  and  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  and  to  ensure \ntangible benefits to women; (c) project reporting reflects gender-specific issues \nand gender-disaggregated data, where applicable; and (d) women will be eligible \nfor equal opportunities and pay generated under the Project.  \n \n(ix)  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to conduct spot audits at any time during \nProject implementation in order to address governance and transparency issues, \nas well as to determine the degree to which project funds have been effectively \nand  efficiently  utilized  to  implement  the  Project  and  achieve  its  objectives, \noutputs and performance indicators. ADB also reserves the right to investigate \ndirectly, or through its agents, any possible financial or management impropriety \nin conducting the Project. The Government shall cooperate with any such audit \nand  investigation  and  extend  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all \nrelevant books and records, as well as engagement of independent auditors and \nexperts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory  completion  of  such  audits  and \ninvestigations. All external costs related to the audits and investigations shall be \nborne by the Project. \n \n(x)  The Government will establish a grievance review mechanism within existing \nPublic Complaints Bureau to address complaints and grievances related to the \nProject. Such mechanism will be in the form of a quasi judicial proceeding to \nfacilitate access to justice in respect of grievances submitted by individuals or \ncommunities with assistance of facilitation units, island based magistrates, IDCs, \nCBOs and NGOs. Facilitation units will be established on each affected island to \nenable individuals/communities to use the grievance review mechanism; and \naccess goods and services financed under the Project and other assistance for \ntsunami-affected  people.  Such  facilitation  units  will  be  established  in \ncollaboration with CBOs and NGOs. \n \nB.  Condition for Grant and Loan Effectiveness \n88.  The Operations Manual of the TRRF, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, will \nhave  been  approved  and  made  effective  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  Treasury  of  the \nMaldives. \n \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1995.

The tsunami which hit the Maldives on 26 December 2004 caused severe damage to the \nphysical infrastructure of many islands.  \n2.  Immediately  following  the  tsunami,  the  Government  of  Maldives  (the  Government) \ncontacted  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank,  requesting  them  to \nundertake  a  joint  assessment  of  the  tsunami  damage  and  recovery  needs.  A  joint  needs \nassessment mission began work on 5 January 2005. The United Nations also participated in the \nmission, along with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). A follow-up mission on \n1\u20134 February 2005 finalized the assessment, revising the initial estimates based on new data \nand  extensive  comments  received  from  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders.  The \nGovernment endorsed the findings of the report on 6 February 2005. \nA.  Estimated Damage and Financing Needs \n3.  The  tsunami  had  a  serious  impact  on  the  Maldives  by  inflicting  extensive  physical \ndamage,  loss  of  life  and  livelihoods,  and  displacement  of  people.  The  current  displaced \npopulation is estimated to be about 12,500. About 6,700 people are internally displaced in their \noriginal islands and about 5,800 are displaced on other islands. Eighty-three people have died \nand twenty-five are still missing feared dead. Out of the 199 inhabited islands of the Maldives, \n13 islands were severely impacted with total destruction, 56 islands sustained major physical \ndamage, and 121 islands moderate damage due to flooding.  Severe damage was caused to \nhouses, tourist resorts, boats and other fishing equipment, schools, health facilities, transport \nand communication equipment, water and sanitation, and electricity infrastructure. There has \nalso been substantial damage to agricultural crops and perennial trees. Farms, homestead \nplots,  and  aquifers  have  been  salinized.  The  physical  damage  has  led  to  severe  human \nsuffering  and  large  segments  of  the  population  have  lost  their  dwellings,  lifetime  assets, \nsavings, and sources of livelihood. Many displaced families are now living in temporary shelters \nor with relatives.  \n4.  Total damages are estimated to be about $470 million, close to 62% of GDP (Table \nA2.1). About $298 million of these are direct damages; $172 million are indirect losses. The cost \nof direct damages is about 8% of the replacement cost of the entire national capital stock, \nestimated to be about $3.8 billion at 2004 prices. The tourism sector has incurred the largest \ndirect damages, with losses estimated at $100 million (of which half is insured), followed by the \nhousing sector with losses close to $65 million.  \n5.  The largest indirect losses also occurred in the tourism sector, which has seen a sharp \ndrop in tourist arrivals (as of end-January 2005, around 6,000 tourists are in the Maldives as \ncompared with more than 16,000 at the same time last year).  \nB.  Estimated Reconstruction Costs  \n6.  Overall Needs. Reconstruction costs for some sectors may be higher than total losses \nbecause of the need to rebuild to higher standards to reduce vulnerability (e.g. housing) and \nbecause current construction or environmental standards are higher than when original facilities \nwere built (e.g. sanitation), or because modern equipment or supplies are of higher quality and \nprovide improved services (e.g. health, education). Some of the indirect losses cannot be \nrecovered: production losses from fishing and agriculture, and tourism cancellations cannot be \nrestored. The financing needs have been divided into short-term and long-term needs. The \n ", "30   Appendix 2 \nshort-term needs reflect investments needed urgently within the next 6 months; the long-term \nneeds cover the period from 6 months to 3 years. The overall financing needs for the next 3 \nyears are expected to be $406 million; of this, $120 million will be needed within the next 6 \nmonths.  \n7.  Public Finance Needs. The needs for public financing are lower than overall financing \nneeds  because  parts  of  the  reconstruction  cost  will  be  absorbed  by  the  private  sector \n(insurance, households, and businesses). Estimated needs for public finance include the cost of \nrestoring basic services, infrastructure, and housing, as well as the cost of certain mitigation \nmeasures made urgent by the tsunami. In addition, the tsunami has led to a government \nrevenue shortfall of $60 million. Total public financing needs over the next 3 years are expected \nto be about $304 million; of this, housing is the largest component.  \n \nTable A2.1: Estimated Losses and Financing Needs  \n($ million) \n  Losses  Cost of Reconstructionb \n  Direct  Indirect  Total  Needs  For  Total  Public \nSector  Losses  Lossesa  Losses  Next 6  Medium  Needs  Financing \nMonths  -Termc  Cost  Needsd \n               \nEducation  15.5  0.0  15.5  8.4  12.7  21.1  21.1 \nHealth  5.6  0.0  5.6  4.9  7.3  12.2  12.2 \nHousing  64.8  0.0  64.8  22.2  51.8  74.0  74.0 \nWater and sanitation  13.1  0.0  13.1  18.4  27.2  45.6  45.6 \nTourism  100.0  130.0  230.0  10.0  90.0  100.0  0.0 \nFisheries  13.2  11.9  25.1  5.8  8.3  14.1  14.1 \nAgriculture  10.8  0.3  11.1  4.8  6.3  11.1  11.1 \nTransport  20.3  0.0  20.3  2.0  25.0  27.0  24.9 \nPower  4.6  0.0  4.6  1.9  2.8  4.6  4.6 \nLivelihoods  0.0  30.0  30.0  17.4  0.0  17.4  17.4 \nEnvironment  0.0  0.0  0.0  3.7  6.1  9.8  9.8 \nDisaster risk  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.7  3.7  4.4  4.4 \nmanagement \nOther costs for new  0.0  0.0  0.0  5.0  10.0  15.0  15.0 \nHosts islandse \nAdministration, etc.e  50.0  0.0  50.0  15.0  35.0  50.0  50.0 \n  Total    297.9  172.2  470.1  120.1  286.2  406.3  304.2 \nLosses/costs as percent of GDP (2004 est.)  62%      54%  40% \nEstimated revenue loss5          60.0 \nTotal financing gap including revenue loss          364.2 \nTotal financing gap including revenue loss as percent of GDP        48% \nGDP = gross domestic product. \na  Indirect loss estimates, particularly for tourism and livelihoods, are not robust. \nb  Reconstruction costs in some sectors are higher than damages because (i) some partially damaged houses will \nneed to be fully rebuilt because the original islands are not livable in anymore, and (ii) new environmental \nstandards apply to new facilities. \nc  The medium term covers the period from 6 to 36 months. \nd  Losses in tourism and transport will be covered by insurance and financial resources available to owners. \ne  Preliminary estimates. \nSource: Estimates of the Joint Needs Assessment undertaken by the Asian Development Bank, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, the United Nations, and the World Bank for the Government. \n \nC.  Damage and Recovery Needs by Sector \n \n8.  Education. Damages in the education sector range from damaged school infrastructure \nto insufficient teaching staff (because some expatriate teachers left). Thirty-seven percent of the \nschools  require  varying  degrees  of  repair  and  rehabilitation.  Six  have  been  completely ", "  Appendix 2  31 \ndestroyed. Replacement of provisions for the affected schoolchildren is an immediate priority, \nalong  with  the  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  damaged  school  facilities  and  construction  of \ntemporary additional classrooms. The cost is estimated to be $21.1 million.  \n9.  Health and Nutrition. Critical emergency needs such as safe drinking water, food, and \nemergency medicines are in place in the affected islands. People who lost their homes have \nbeen provided temporary shelters, and people reporting major injuries have been promptly \nattended  to.  The  critical  challenge  now  is  to  sustain  these  inputs  until  more  permanent \narrangements are in place, and to make the damaged health facilities functional as early as \npossible. In addition, there is a need for short-term food assistance for displaced families in 13 \nislands.. The total cost of rehabilitating the health sector is expected to be $12.2 million.  \n10.  Housing. Private housing suffered severe damage. The wave damaged structural and \nnonstructural elements of houses, breaking boundary walls and facades, and indirectly leading \nto houses, many of which had no foundations, collapsing. The preliminary assessment reports \n1,847 houses totally destroyed and 3,500 partially damaged. For the houses to be built anew, \nthe Government has proposed a two-stage housing reconstruction plan. In the first stage, a \nbasic dwelling unit will be constructed. In the second stage, financial incentives will be provided \nfor households to extend, modify, or improve the basic unit. Reconstruction costs are estimated \nat $74 million.  \n11.  Fisheries. Because of the tsunami, 120 fishing vessels were lost or totally destroyed, 50 \nfishing vessels were partially damaged or lost equipment, 5 reef fishing boats lost equipment, 16 \nocean cages were lost, 374 fish processors lost equipment, and 8 boatsheds and 2 fishery \ninstitutes were damaged. The estimated recovery cost for the damaged or lost vessels and \nprovision of necessary equipment is $14.1 million. \n12.  Agriculture. The tsunami damaged field crops in 2,103 farms; destroyed backyard \ncrops and agricultural tools in 11,678 homesteads; and damaged more than 700,000 fruit trees \nand 840,000 timber trees in inhabited islands. The damage to land and groundwater resources \nis  severe  in  35  agricultural  islands,  and  saline  water  intrusion  has  affected  112  inhabited \nislands. Recovery needs are estimated at $11.1 million. The reestablishment of the agricultural \ncrops will involve improvement of soil, forestry, and water resources, importation of planting \nmaterial, and provision of extension services, some of which will have to be obtained from other \ncountries.  \n13.  Water  Supply,  Sanitation  and  Solid  Waste  Management.  Preliminary  estimates \nsuggest the potential loss of up to 1,000 community rainwater tanks, 6,000 household rainwater \ntanks and 20,000 m3 of rainwater supplies. Roof water harvesting piping and gutter systems \nhave also been damaged, affecting an estimated 5,000 households. Up to 850 well pumps are \nestimated to have been lost as a result of flooding. In addition, the quality of groundwater \nsupplies in 36 islands may have been compromised due to saline and sewage contamination. In \naddition, it is estimated that an approximate 5,000 toilets and 3,500 septic tanks may need to be \nprovided, while there is also small bore sewer loss in highly affected areas. Recovery needs are \nestimated at $45.6 million. \n14.  Tourism. The impact from the tsunami is significant for both the private and public \nsectors. Direct damage to the tourism infrastructure and other related businesses is estimated \nat over $100 million, some of which will be covered by insurance. More significant is the loss of \nrevenue from the downturn in tourist arrivals. The loss in total tourism receipts is estimated at \n$130 million. The key to minimizing the financial impact is to bring tourists back as quickly as \n ", "32   Appendix 2 \npossible. This requires marketing focusing on the travel trade and potential tourists with the \nmessage that the tourism sector is operating normally, that most resorts were unaffected, that it \nis safe to visit the Maldives, and that visitors are welcome.  \n15.  Transportation and Communications. The damage to transport and communication \ninfrastructure (harbors, jetties, causeways, navigational aids, airports, telecoms) was less than \noriginally feared. About 4,200 m length of quay wall, and 15,000 m of harbor or sea walls and \nbreakwaters have been damaged or destroyed.  Dredging will be needed to remove about \n370,000 m3 tsunami-inflicted siltation. Five causeways have been partly damaged. While the \ntelecommunications sector initially completely failed, all connections were restored by 7 January \n2005. It is estimated that about one third of navigation aids were damaged or destroyed. \nRecovery costs will amount to about $27 million. \n16.  Power. The tsunami damaged the electric power supply system in 95 islands (about \n48% of the islands with electricity) and there was no electricity for several days. The damaged \nfacilities include: 24 power houses, 104 generators, 652 streetlights, 34 switchboards, 632 \ndistribution boxes, and more than 121 kilometers of cables. The Government is planning to \nrestore the electricity supply systems in all affected islands to pre-tsunami levels. The recovery \nneeds amount to $4.65 million, covering the installation of new equipment. \n17.  Public Administration. A preliminary assessment of damages is $50 million. However, \nfurther assessments of the damage to public offices such as island offices and courts may be \nneeded. Repair of public offices is vital to enable them to function effectively in support of the \nrecovery efforts. \nD.  External Financing Needs \n18.  The government provided swift relief to the affected islands and is now engaged in \nplanning and executing a reconstruction program. However, it faces a financing gap estimated \nat $364 million, so external finance has been sought.  At the end of February, total commitments \nof cash assistance amounted to $61.6 million, of which $25.7 million has been received. The \nWorld Bank has provided $14 million in a mixture of grants and credits. The Government of \nJapan has committed $20 million of grants. However, it is clear that foreign financing received or \npledged so far falls far short of the estimated reconstruction needs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  33 \nMACROECONOMIC IMPACT \n \nA.  Macroeconomic Performance Before the Tsunami \n \n1.  The Maldives achieved a robust annual average real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth of 7.2% over 1997\u20132003 and graduated from least developed country (LDC) status in \nDecember 2004.  \n \n2.  The Maldives\u2019 most important economic sector is tourism, which in 2003 accounted for \n33% of GDP and grew by 15% in that year. Other important sectors include transport and \ncommunications  (14%  of  GDP),  manufacturing  (8%  of  GDP)  and  fisheries  (7%  of  GDP). \nSustained  growth  in  tourism  stimulated  growth  in  construction,  transportation  and \ncommunications, and wholesale and retail trade. Despite a modest share of around 3% of GDP, \nagriculture is important to the island economies because it supplies food security and provides \nemployment\u2014particularly for women in the remote atolls. \n3.  The Maldives is an open economy because it needs to import almost everything except \nfish products, and to earn foreign exchange from tourism and fish products to finance its \nimports. The Maldives' fundamental reliance on the two export sectors\u2014tourism and fisheries\u2014\nmakes it highly vulnerable to internal and external shocks.  \n \n4.  Over the period 1999\u20132004, the Maldives has run an average budget deficit of 4.3% of \nGDP.  Both  current  and  capital  expenditures  have  been  rising  since  1999.  Several \ndevelopments,  including  the  high  priority  given  to  human  development\u2014particularly  for \ncommunity programs, social security, and welfare\u2014and the sharp increase in housing and \ninfrastructure, explain the recent jump in current and capital expenditures. On the revenue side, \nthe tax to GDP ratio has been stagnant over the past 4 years. The Maldives\u2019 fiscal revenue is \nbased primarily on import duties, income from tourism, dividends from state-owned enterprises, \nand resort lease rents. In addition to its own budgetary resources, the Maldives has benefited \nfrom bilateral grants, although since 2001 revenue from grants has been declining. \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s revenue stream is highly vulnerable to external factors. Tourism tax \ncollection depends on the number of tourists. Bilateral grants steadily diminished from 4.5% of \nGDP in 1996 to 1.4% of GDP in 2003. Before 2003, the fiscal deficit was automatically financed \nfrom the ways and means account (WMA) at the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA). Starting \nfrom 2004, the Government adopted a policy of not resorting to automatic financing of the deficit \nfrom the WMA. Inflation has remained low in recent years, ranging from \u20133% to 3%. Inflation in \n2003 was \u20132.9%, compared with 0.9% in 2002. This is the lowest inflation rate in 12 years. \nPublic debt has continued to grow and reached the equivalent of 46.5% of GDP in 2003. Public \nexternal debt amounted to 30% of GDP in 2003.  \n \n6.  Exports and imports grew rapidly during 2003. The current account deficit widened as \ngrowth in imports exceeded growth in exports. With a large capital account surplus, the overall \nbalance of payments improved from a deficit of $21.4 million in 2001 to a surplus of $74.3 \nmillion in 2003. Reserves currently amount to about $200 million. Bearing in mind the openness \nof the economy, the amount of short-term external debt, and the potential for capital flight by \nresidents, reserves are relatively low. \n \n ", "34   Appendix 3 \nB.  The Macroeconomic Impact of the Tsunami \n7.  The Maldives was the only country where the effects of the tsunami were felt across the \ncountry, rather than in certain parts or regions. It is among the worst-affected countries and will \nprobably face the highest per capita reconstruction costs. The tsunami has severely affected \nsuch key economic sectors as tourism, fisheries, and agriculture, and essential infrastructure \nlike water supply, sanitation and power, the effects of which will spill over to other sectors. Given \nthe scale of the damage (estimated at 62% of 2004 GDP) and the fragile fiscal situation, even \nbefore the tsunami, considerable external assistance will be needed for the economy to recover. \n \n1.  Economic Impact per Sector \n8.  The negative publicity following the tsunami has led to a steep decline in tourism. The \ndisaster occurred in the period of peak occupancy rates, well above 90% (for a total of 16,100 \noperational beds). The occupancy rate at the end of January 2005 was around 45% (for a total \nof 12,800 operational beds). \n \n9.  Tourism is expected to return to normal levels in the long run, as the chance of another \ntsunami is perceived as slight. The recovery in tourism activity will also depend on the speed \nwith which the infrastructure (airports, jetties, hotels, harbours and roads) can be rehabilitated or \nreconstructed. Repairs to some resorts may take up to 1 year. The tourism sector is likely to \nexperience a 25% decline in 2005 relative to 2004. \n \n10.  Activity in wholesale and retail trade, transport and communications will be affected by \nthe decline in tourism.  \n \n11.  Damage in the fisheries sector is compounded by the loss of harbors, jetties, and \nvessels. About 120 fishing vessels were completely destroyed and 50 more partially damaged. \nDamage to fish stocks and reefs was limited. No growth in fisheries is anticipated in 2005. \n \n12.  Agricultural crops were swept away and most agricultural land was covered with salty \nmud,  leaving  it  temporarily  unusable.  As  a  result  of  the  destruction  (combined  with  lower \ndemand from resorts), the agriculture sector is likely to contract by about 5% in 2005. \n \n13.  A number of sectors are, however, expected to experience higher growth as a result of \nreconstruction in the wake of the tsunami. This is the case for coral and sand mining and \nconstruction. \n \n2.  Economic Growth \n14.  The combined impact of the tsunami will decelerate GDP growth substantially. Economic \ngrowth forecasts for 2005 have been revised downwards form the pre-tsunami estimate of 7.5% \nto 1%.  \n \n3.  Government Financing \n15.  The impact of the tsunami on public finances is likely to be substantial. The effects \ninclude a reduction in revenues resulting from a lower tax base in combination with an increase \nin both current and capital expenditures.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  35 \n16.  On the revenue side, government receipts from the tourism bed-night tax, and duties on \ntourism-related imports are likely to fall significantly. In addition, the government has decided to \nwaive import duties on all tsunami-related imports. Increased grant receipts mitigate some of the \ndecline in other government revenues. External grants in 2005 are expected to increase to 7.2% \nof GDP compared to the projected 1% pre-tsunami estimate.  \n \n17.  On  the  expenditure  side,  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  efforts  will  considerably \nincrease public expenditure. Government expenditure is expected to increase from 42% of GDP \nto 54%. The budget deficit (including grants) is expected to rise from a projected 4% of GDP to \n10.5% of GDP. The budget deficit, excluding grants, would amount to 17.8% of GDP. \n \n18.  These figures raise concern over the sustainability of the deficit and how it will be \nfinanced. Given the limited manoeuvring space for the government as a result of continued \ndeficit spending in the recent past, there is a danger that reconstruction spending will be \nconstrained by a lack of financing. \n \n4.  External Accounts \n19.  The external balance is also expected to worsen, the contributing factors being the \nslowdown in tourism, and an increase in imports necessary for reconstruction. This comes in \naddition to an expected decrease in exports from the garments industry following the phase out \nof the Multi-Fiber Arrangement. However, increases in both official transfers and remittances \nare mitigating factors. Overall, the current account deficit is expected to rise sharply to about \n23% of GDP. The deficit in the balance of payments is likely to be about $68 million in 2005, \nafter adjustments for a substantial increase in expected external assistance. \n \n5.  Employment \n20.  Before the tsunami, tourism employed almost 40% of the labor force. So far most resorts \nhave chosen not to dismiss any workers, who continue to be paid, although some have been \ntemporarily reassigned to resorts abroad. Fisheries accounted for another 11% of the labor \nforce, and this sector has been badly affected by the loss of fishing vessels, equipment, and by \nthe erosion of agricultural lands. A number of small-scale programs that provide cash for work, \nsuch as brick-making, have been begun by NGOs to provide some affected people with a \ntemporary income. Quotas on the inflow of foreign workers have been temporarily lifted because \nof the need for labor for reconstruction. Before the tsunami, the Government had started the \ndevelopment of a retraining program for the unemployed and this may need to be implemented \nmore rapidly.  \n \nC.  Mitigating the Economic Downturn \n21.  Key measures to mitigate the adverse macroeconomic impacts of the tsunami include: \n \n(i)  Income support to the affected population, for example as is being done through \ncash transfers. This also helps to maintain liquidity in the atolls. \n(ii)  Support for affected populations so they can restore their livelihoods by financing \nthe replacement of key assets and tools and employing local labor in rebuilding \ninfrastructure. \n(iii)  Encouraging a resumption in tourism activity by conveying a clear message to \nthe rest of the world that (a) key infrastructure, like the airport, is safe and \n ", "36   Appendix 3 \nfunctioning normally, and (b) the impact of the tsunami on most resorts was \nminor and they are open for business.  \n(iv)  Ensuring that the reconstruction effort is consistent with macroeconomic stability \nover the medium term, by containing the fiscal deficit, adopting an appropriate \nexchange rate policy, and preserving price stability. \n \nD.  Financing Relief and Reconstruction \n22.  Significant external financing is needed, in the form of grants and concessional loans to \nthe government, as well as higher inflows of private funds, to finance the budget and the \nwidening current account deficit of the balance of payments. External finance has been sought. \nAs of the end of February, total commitments of cash assistance amounted to $61.6 million from \nbilateral, UN, and private sources. The World Bank has provided $14 million in mixed grants \nand credits and the IMF $6.3 million in emergency assistance. The Government of Japan has \ncommitted $20 million in grants. However, foreign financing received or pledged so far falls far \nshort of the estimated needs. \n \n23.  It needs to be emphasized that the terms on which external finance is available will \ndetermine the pace of reconstruction. Indeed, in undertaking additional external liability for post-\ntsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction, the Government will need to be particularly careful in \nnot running up external debt stocks to uncomfortable levels, which could impact future growth \nprospects.  \n \n24.  In addition to the government, it is anticipated that the private sector will increase foreign \nborrowings, in order to finance bank liquidity and the reconstruction of resorts. Such borrowings \ncould sharply raise total external debt. Hence, as much as possible grants will be the preferred \nmode of external assistance to finance post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3        37\nTable A3: Key Economic Indicators\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\n(Est.)

The Government of the Maldives (the Government) has set up a Tsunami Relief and \nReconstruction Fund (TRRF) under the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). The TRRF \nwill manage all resources received from international and local sources in cash or in kind, and \nwill channel all resources to programmed relief and reconstruction activities. The TRRF will \noperate as a separate fund within the budget framework of the Government, and will enable the \nGovernment to transparently delineate and account for tsunami-related assistance and ensure \neffective  use  of  funds.  The  Government\u2019s  objectives  for  establishing  the  TRRF  are:  (i)  to \nsignificantly reduce the risk of delays in the availability of funds at the operational level; (ii) to \nenable disbursement of funds in a timely manner for smooth implementation; (iii) to replenish \nthe account quickly to maintain program momentum; and (iv) to increase the speed, accuracy \nand transparency of reporting. The Government has requested that donors provide as much of \ntheir funding as possible through the TRRF to: (i) assure transparency and harmonization, (ii) \neliminate duplication of efforts, and (iii) reduce administrative overheads. \n \n2.  A needs assessment, recently completed for the Government by a joint team from World \nBank, ADB, and the UN, estimated the total public financing needs for reconstruction at about \n$304 million. Of this, approximately one third is required to meet immediate reconstruction \nneeds for the first 6 months. The remaining is required to meet medium-term reconstruction \nneeds\u2014from 6 months to 36 months. Total commitments reported by the Government as of  the \nend of February 2005 are around $61.6 million, of which $25.7 million has been received. The \nGovernment anticipates that all tsunami reconstruction assistance will be managed under the \nTRRF. Total cash and in kind receipts as of end February 2005 amount to about $68 million \n(about 62% in kind and 38% in cash).1 \n \n3.  Management Structure. The TRRF Board is appointed by the President and comprises \nseven  members:  three  senior  civil  servants  (including  the  Auditor  General  of  Maldives  as \nChairman),  three  representatives  from  the  private  sector,  and  one  representative  from \ninternational donor agencies. The Board will provide oversight and strategic advice to the fund. \nThe Board\u2019s functions include ensuring effective implementation of the relief and reconstruction \nwork; monitoring activities; critically reviewing the operational reports, including expenditures; \nand promoting transparency in operations by ensuring broad dissemination of information on the \nutilization of funds.  \n   \n4.  Staffing. The day to day management of the fund would be entrusted to the MOFT. The \nTRRF central project management unit (PMU) team will initially be composed of regular staff, \nadditional staff will be recruited as required. The financial management subteam will be headed \nby the Financial Controller and will consist of senior staff members who will supervise and/or \nundertake  accounting,  inventory  control,  and  audit  functions.  The  tender  and  procurement \nfunction will be supported by the tender and procurement section, MOFT. Technical support, \nfollow up and supervision will be provided by designated staff of the line ministries. \n \n5.  Financing Plan. The TRRF team is in the process of committing resources to specific \nsector support activities. A financing plan is being prepared by MOFT that will match funding \nagainst sector activities in which reconstruction financing has been identified as needed. The \n                                                 \n1 Separate records are being maintained for aid received in kind. The inventory of supplies received and supplies \nissued is being periodically updated. Physical and administrative controls are being maintained by the National \nSecurity Service (NSS). The NSS has been mandated to monitor and control the movement of in kind aid by \ncontrolling warehousing and transportation arrangements, and controls in place include intake registries, requisition \nslips, release slips, periodic inventory counts, and segregation of duties. \n ", "44   Appendix 5 \nfinancing plan will be dynamic and subject to bi-monthly revisions to reflect changes to donor \ncommitments as they are finalized, and the identification of new sources. The Government is in \nthe  process  of  developing  sector-specific  strategies  and  prioritized  investment  plans  for \nreconstruction activities. It is also revising its budget for FY2005 to include TRRF funds and \nexpenditures.  TRRF  planning  and  budgeting  will  then  be  integrated  into  the  Government \nbudgetary process. \n \n6.  Funds Flow. All receipts received by the TRRF will be deposited to a designated \naccount for the TRRF (Account No. 1615) held at the Maldives Monetary Authority. Funds will \nbe deposited in two ways: (i) directly to account no. 1615; and (ii) transferred from two MOFT \nbank accounts at the Bank of Maldives (account No. 7701-147-900-001 for rufiyaa and 7701-\n147-900-002 for US dollars for donations received in cash, and donations from abroad. Funds \nfrom ADB (and other partner agencies) will be deposited into individual subaccounts of account \n1615 in accordance with donor-specific funding requirements. All TRRF expenditures will be \npaid from account No. 1615. For donor-funded activities payments  will be made from the \nrespective subaccount within account 1615. \n \n7.  Operations  Manual.  The  TRRF  operations  manual2  has  been  prepared  by  the \nGovernment to outline guidelines for: (i) activity/project evaluation, appraisal and approval, (ii) \nflow of funds, (iii) accounting and financial reporting standards, and (iv) audit arrangements. It is \nbased upon existing government financial regulations, but significant attempts have been made \nby the Government to strengthen the financial and internal controls to ensure that the special \nneeds of the TRRF are addressed. While the TRRF OM provides an appropriate framework, \nsome sections require strengthening and further details. The OM has been reviewed by the \nWorld Bank and ADB, and recommendations by them are being incorporated. OM Version I will \nbe made effective after it has been approved by the MOFT in March 2005. The Government \nintends OM to be a \u2018living document\u2019 and regular updates will be issued to reflect additional \nrequirements as they arise, as well as to strengthen internal controls as a result of audit \nrecommendations. \n   \n8.  Accounting. The Government is committed to ensuring that a TRRF accounting system, \ndeveloped in accordance with sound accounting principles, is established as soon as possible.3 \nTRRF accounts are to be maintained, and reports on physical and financial progress regularly \nprepared, in accordance with the TRRF OM. An off-the-shelf accounting software package \n(Quickbooks)4 is in the process of being installed and programmed to meet TRRF requirements. \nIt is intended that the accounting system be implemented initially under a modified cash system \nand on a double entry basis. It will be voucher-based, and computerized. TRRF accounting \n                                                 \n2 TRRF Financial Management Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines, draft dated 9 January 2005, and TRRF \nOperations Manual, draft dated 26 January 2005. \n3  The Government has already initiated a number of steps to strengthen its accounting system including as a result \nof dialogue with ADB linked to Loan 1915 (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of the Maldives for the Strengthening of the Public Accounting \nSystem Project. Manila). This process will continue and will be further accelerated once implementation of the loan \nbegins.  \n4  Implementation of Quickbooks is an interim measure until the full featured Government accounting system, that is \nanticipated  to  address  the  broad  spectrum  of  public  financial  management  and  treasury  requirements \n(macroeconomic forecasting, budget preparation and approval, budget execution, accounting, cash management, \ndebt management, revenue administration, auditing, as well as medium term fiscal and expenditure reporting, and \ngrant management), and possibly human resource management, procurement and contract management, project \nmanagement, as well as other e-governance applications, is installed as planned with ADB support under Loan \n1915 (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nthe Republic of Maldives for the Strengthening of the Public Accounting System Project. Manila).  ", "  Appendix 5  45 \npolicies  are  in  the  process  of  being  determined  and  will  be  explicitly  outlined  in  the  OM. \nStrengthening of the TRRF chart of accounts has been identified as a critical priority, which the \nGovernment has agreed to address. The Government has also indicated that material and fixed \nasset registries will be established and control processes developed and implemented.  \n \n9.  Financial Reporting. TRRF reporting will be undertaken in accordance with the OM, \nand complemented by physical reporting and other documentation prepared by the Government \ndepartments involved in the supervision, implementation, and monitoring of TRRF projects and \nactivities. TRRF report formats will be reviewed to ensure that they meet donor requirements. \nHowever,  as  agreed  at  the  outset,  donors  are  expected  to  harmonize  and  coordinate \nrequirements. The frequency and type of reports will be outlined in the OM, and main formats \nannexed. As discussed with the Government, the chart of accounts and reporting formats will \nhave to be structured to enable reports to be prepared for the TRRF as a whole, as well as by \nfinancing source, by sector (and possibly by subsector), by project, and by expenditure type.  \n \n10.  Auditing. The TRRF audit strategy is targeted to ensure: (i) timely corrective actions by \nthe TRRF and its implementing agencies, and (ii) identification of recommendations that will \nsupport improved and/or further enhancement of accountability and transparency. The TRRF, \nas per the Presidential Decree, is required to be audited by an international firm of chartered \naccountants, acceptable to ADB and other donors, under international standards of auditing to \nmaintain full transparency and to provide adequate assurance to all stakeholders. The audit firm \nwill  be  nominated  by  the  TRRF  Board,  and  contracted  upon  approval  of  stakeholders  in \naccordance with outline terms of reference to be annexed to the OM. External audits will be \nundertaken every 6 months for the first year of implementation because of the high level of \nexpected expenditure, and annually thereafter. \n \n11.  In addition to the external audit, the TRRF will be subject to a regular internal audit by an \ninternational firm of chartered accountants, approved by the Auditor General of the Maldives, to \nassess whether funds have been disbursed in a timely way, that they have reached intended \nrecipients,  that  transactional  controls  and  propriety  have  been  maintained,  and  all  TRRF \nresources have been used effectively and efficiently for the intended purposes. Internal audit \noutline terms of reference are to be annexed to the OM. The selection process for the internal \nauditors has begun and an audit will begin in March 2005.  The first reports are expected by \nmid-April 2005. The internal audit reports will be shared with ADB, upon request. \n \n12.  Performance audits will also be undertaken, based on an agreed upon project selection \nstrategy and selection criteria, so that representative coverage is achieved by financing source. \nThe  strategy  and  selection  criteria  for  implementing  the  performance  audits  and  the \nperformance audit outline terms of reference are to be annexed to the OM. \n \n13.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  A  central  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished under the National Economic Recovery and Reconstruction Program (NERRP). The \ncentral PMU will be responsible for consolidating the project proposals from the implementing \nagencies to be submitted for approval to the project coordination committee.5 The central PMU \nwill be responsible for (i) preparing bidding documents and conducting procurement of civil \nworks, equipment, goods and related services for reconstruction efforts; (ii) recommending the \n                                                 \n5 The Project Coordination Committee (PCC) will be co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and Treasury and the \nMinister  of  Planning  and  National  Development  or  their  respective  designates,  and  will  include  high-level \nrepresentatives  from  MPND  and  the  implementing  agencies,  as  well  as  the  Ministry  of  Gender,  Family \nDevelopment and Social Security and Department of External Resources (DER). The PCC will provide guidance to \nthe PMU on policy matters, and specifically decide the selection of high priority subprojects proposed by the PMU.  \n ", "46   Appendix 5 \nrelease of grant funds under working capital schemes to the affected communities; (iii) paying \nand disbursing funds; (iv) accounting and preparing financial statements; and (v) monitoring and \nevaluating the performance of NERRP/project objectives and activities. The Government has \nagreed to undertake project performance monitoring and evaluation in accordance with donor \nrequirements. This will necessarily include the development of baseline indicators and targets \nfor the NERRP, each sector and each project prior to implementation for monitoring purposes, \nas well as checking selected projects against defined project selection criteria.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  47 \nWATER SUPPLY, SANITATION, AND SOLID WASTE SECTOR ASSESSMENT AND \nPROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Damage and Impact \n1.  While much progress had been made over the past decade throughout the Maldives in \nproviding water and storage through rainwater tank programs, investment in sanitation and solid \nwaste management has been more limited. This has resulted in deteriorating living conditions \non many inhabited islands. Impacts resulting from the absence of basic infrastructure and \nenvironmental services in the atolls was further exacerbated by the damage following the high \nwaves and flooding of the Indian Ocean tsunami which hit the Maldives on 26 December 2004, \nleading  in  some  cases  to  absolute  destruction  of  existing  infrastructure.  The  sector  was \nseriously affected: whilst provision of water supply and basic sanitation services are in urgent \nneed of replacement, rehabilitation or reconstruction, the need to expedite adequate solid waste \nmanagement practices and structuring the sector for efficient operation emerged as critical to \ncope with damage and debris. \n \n2.  Water supply in the atolls is almost entirely provided through a combination of rainwater \ntanks (both household and communal), which are the principal source of drinking water and \ngroundwater extraction through domestic wells, commonly utilized for washing and bathing. \nDamages include loss of all water supplies, household and communal rainwater tanks, damage \nto roof water harvesting piping and gutter systems and well pumps. The extent of damage to the \nsanitation and sewerage network will require a detailed assessment before prioritization. In \nextensively affected areas a significant number of toilets and septic tanks need replacing, or \nwhen the structures remain undamaged desludging is required, whilst small bore sewer and \noutfall loss is estimated to be as large as 126 km and 2.4 km, respectively. The joint ADB, UN \nand World Bank Needs Assessment Mission estimated the recovery needs to be $45 million. \n \nB.  Scope \n \n3.  This component will rehabilitate and provide water supply, sanitation and solid waste \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  services  for  the  69  most  affected  islands  communities.1 \nRehabilitation works will be carried out to restore facilities to pre-tsunami level or to a higher \ncost-effective environmentally-acceptable standard. The Project will be divided into two phases: \na short-term phase allowing the procurement of critical equipment, which will include immediate \nfunding for short term efforts, focusing on (i) providing immediate safe water to affected areas \nthrough community and household rainwater tanks and rainwater harvesting equipment; (ii) \nproviding  basic  temporary  sanitation  facilities  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  sanitation \ninfrastructure, including the provision of desludging systems and sludge drying beds; and (iii) \nproviding  solid  waste  management  equipment  (including  communal  bins,  composters, \ncompactors, cutters, among others) and training for clearing and recovery of debris material. \n \n4.  Medium-term  assistance  will  focus  on  (i)  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of \nenvironmental infrastructure damaged by the tsunami (including sewage systems, networks and \noutfalls),  (ii)  provision  of  water  and  sewage  treatment  and  disposal  facilities  for  displaced \npopulation after the tsunami rendered their islands inhabitable; (iii) provision and development \nof  disaster  solid  waste  management  systems  and  facilities;  coupled  with  (iv)  community \n                                                 \n1 The National Disaster Management Center of the Republic of the Maldives reported more than 2,200 affected \nhouseholds in 69 most-affected islands, of which 36 highly or very highly affected islands.  \n ", "48   Appendix 6 \nmobilization and organization for utilities management, operation and maintenance; and (v) \nprovision of institutional support and capacity building for environmental disaster management. 2 \n \n5.  By providing increased drinking water supplies, the Project will help protect the existing \nfreshwater lens from over-extraction, protect public health from potential waterborne diseases \nand the overall demands on the fragile aquifer will be reduced. The Project will also include the \ninstallation  of  appropriate  sanitation  solutions,  reducing  the  potential  contamination  of  the \ngroundwater. Subproject selection and design will consider and promote community project \nimplementation as well as management, operation and maintenance of the resulting schemes. It \nwill encourage participation from vulnerable groups and encourage women\u2019s participation in \nO&M of new schemes. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n6.

The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) will be the Project's Executing Agency for \nrehabilitation,  reconstruction  and  provision  of  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  the  Economic  Recovery  and  Reconstruction  Programme \n(ERRP) will be the implementing agency. ERRP will set up a PMU, led by a full-time Project \nDirector (PD) with good overall sector, managerial and communication experience and skills. \nTechnical experts from the Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (MWSA), Ministry of Health, \nand Ministry of Environment and Construction (MEC) will be assigned to support the PMU. In \nconsultation  with  island  communities,  technical  experts  and  the  atoll  development  offices, \nsupported by the consultant, will jointly carry out selection of subprojects. The result of the \nselection will be endorsed by the team leader of the Project consultants who will ensure the \nadequate application of the selection criteria. The PMU activities will include (i) preparing the \noverall  Project  implementation  plan  and  consolidated  annual  work  plan,  (ii)  supervising  all \nproject  management  activities,  (iii)  organizing  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  and  (iv) \npreparing overall progress reports and the project completion report.   \n \n  2.   Procurement \n \n9.  Procurement will be conducted in agreement with guidelines for the main Project. \n   \n  3.   Implementation Schedule \n \n10.  The Project will be implemented over 2 years.

Consulting services are \nrequired to facilitate project implementation and to strengthen institutional, administrative, and \nfinancial capacities of the PMU. The consultants providing consulting services to PMU and \nfinanced under the assistance will be engaged individually in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. \n \n12.  The management design and supervision consultants should have extensive experience \nin designing and executing urban development as well as water supply, sanitation and solid \nwaste management projects. Practical experience should cover planning and feasibility design \nof projects, policies, uses and methods, and participatory consultative processes. Experience \nworking in small island environments would be beneficial. \n \n5.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  To ensure that project components are managed efficiently and that project benefits are \nmaximized, a project performance management system (PPMS) will be developed. The PPMS \nwill monitor and evaluate project information and data to ensure that planned interventions \nachieve the desired result and beneficial impact on the target population. The PPMS activities \nwill be conducted periodically to gather information from multiple sources to determine whether \nthe input deliveries for implementing project activities have rendered expected benefits to the \nintended beneficiaries.

Due  to  the  archipelagic  nature  of  its  topography,  the  Maldivian  transport  sector  is \nmaritime and airborne based with few paved roads in Mal\u00e9 (60km), on Laamu and Addu Atolls \n(14 km each) and the rest of unknown lengths of compacted coral village roads including of \nabout 250 km of such roads under maintenance of the Ministry of Construction and Public \nWorks. \n \n2.  Domestic transport of freight and passengers is predominantly by sea. As there are no \nsignificantly large regional centers in the Maldives, transport between Mal\u00e9 and individual small \nisland communities dominates domestic maritime freight and passenger traffic. In this regard, \nMal\u00e9-to-outer islands traffic is almost entirely import cargo transshipped at Mal\u00e9 Port. Heavy \ncongestion prevails at the inter-atoll harbor in Mal\u00e9. Maritime transport services between Mal\u00e9 \nand the outer islands, and within and between the outer atolls, are inadequate and often \nunreliable. Inter-atoll and inter-island shipping services are operated entirely by the private \nsector, while the Government provides essential infrastructure such as ports and protected \nisland harbors, and regulatory functions like maritime safety administration. Aside from the main \nport in Mal\u00e9, the country has about 90 manmade protected island harbors with quays, basins \nand breakwaters; several natural harbors; jetties and approach channels to access the 200 \ninhabited islands. However, most of the islands are lacking proper transport infrastructure. 86 \nnos.  \u201c12-miles  light  beacons,\u201d  209  nos.  \u201c2-miles  reef  markers\u201d  and  390  \u201charbor  entrance \nmarkers\u201d mark the inter-atoll and inter-island shipping routes. \n \n3.  The  airport  sector  consists  of  1  international  airport  and  3  regional  airports  in  the \nsouthern and one in the northern atolls. \n \nB.  Damage and Impact of the Tsunami \n \n4.  While the 26 December Tsunami inflicted severe physical damage to housing, power \nfacilities,  agriculture  and  fisheries,  the  damage  to  the  transport  infrastructure  was  less  in \ncomparison than originally feared. This can largely be attributed to the facts that ports and \nmaritime facilities are generally located at the inner side of the atolls, away from the direct \ntsunami impact and that the airports are located on islands where the tsunami had limited \nimpact, like for example in Mal\u00e9 and Gan islands where the most substantial port and airport \ninfrastructure is located. \n \n5.  It is estimated that about one third of the navigation aids were damaged or destroyed. \nAbout 36 jetties are reported to have some damage. About 4,200 m length of quay walls, and \n15,000 length of harbor/sea walls and breakwaters have been damaged or destroyed, and \nabout 370,000 m3 of dredging will be required to remove tsunami-inflicted siltation of harbor \nbasis  and  approach  channels.  Five  causeways,  which  are  very  important  for  inter-island \nconnection, have been partly damaged.  \n \n6.  There  are  also  some  damages  to  Mal\u00e9  Commercial  Harbor  and  Mal\u00e9  International \nAirport, part of which will be covered by insurance. However, appropriate safety operation of the \nairport requires a short-term intervention. Tsunami-related damage in Mal\u00e9 International Airport \nincludes  airfield  area  and  drainage  works,  sea  wall  defenses,  navigation  equipment  and \ncommunications equipment. \n ", "52   Appendix 7 \n7.  Based  on  the  figures  made  available  from  142  tsunami-affected  islands  and  after \ndiscussions with the relevant line ministries, the Joint WB-ADB-UN System-JBIC Assessment \nMission estimated the cost of reconstruction for the transport sector at $24.9 million. \n \nC.  Project Scope \n \n8.  This  project  component  comprises:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  damaged  jetties,  (ii)  priority \nrepairs  on  sea  walls  and  quay  walls,  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  Mal\u00e9  International  Airport. \nAdditionally, the following emergency projects identified by the Joint Donor\u2019s needs Assessment \nMission and by the Government for immediate implementation should be covered under the \nquick  disbursing  component,  for  which  specific  assurances  should  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment: (i) rehabilitation/reinstatement of maritime navigation aids damaged or destroyed, \n(ii) procurement of emergency inter-island transportation capacity for reconstruction works, (iii) \npriority repairs in causeways, and (iv) priority dredging of harbor basis and approach channels. \nThe survey identified priorities and estimates for the rehabilitation cost. Rehabilitation works will \nbe carried out to restore the facilities to the pre-tsunami level or to a higher standard as \nconsidered cost-effective in the long run and, where appropriate, will include coastal protection \nmeasures to mitigate damage from future natural disasters. \n \nD.    Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n9.  The cost of restoration work is about $3.6 million equivalent. Under the proposed project, \nthe foreign exchange component comprises about $0.3 million. The total local currency cost is \n$3.3 million equivalent, and includes local taxes and duties, and Project Management Unit \n(PMU) costs.

Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MTCA) and the Ministry of Atolls Development \n(MOAD) will be Implementing Agencies (IA) for the transport component. It will assign staff to \nthe PMU under the component, and will be responsible in technical matters in its respective \narea. The IA will be responsible for the detailed preparatory activities and implementation of its \nspecific subprojects, and will report the progress of each subproject. The IA will nominate a \ncoordinator, acceptable to ADB, to administer its respective project subcomponents, who will be \nresponsible to oversee social, resettlement, and environmental issues as well as engineering \naspects included in a contract package. The coordinator will have necessary resources and \nfacilities for implementing each one of the subprojects. \n \n    2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n12.  Implementation of the Project is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2005, \nand will be completed by December 2006.

Damage and Impact \n \n1.  Various organizations are providing electric power in Maldives, with the State Electric \nCompany Limited (STELCO), a government-owned enterprise, as the largest supplier. STELCO \nis currently responsible for supplying electricity to the capital island of Mal\u00e9 and to 25 of the \nlarger  outer  islands.  In  other  outer  islands,  the  electricity  is  being  supplied  by  the  Island \nDevelopment  Committees  (IDCs),  cooperatives,  NGOs  and  small  private  companies.  Each \nprovider is responsible for both power generation and distribution to the households. Diesel-\nbased generators are used to generate power in all islands. STELCO holds the largest share of \npower supply with a total installed generating capacity of 49 MW. The generating capacity of the \nelectricity providers in the outer islands is estimated at 16 MW; this excludes the power supply \nin the resort islands, which is being taken care by the respective private resort operators. \nDistribution network from the generators comprises mainly underground low voltage cables, \nexcept in Mal\u00e9 and a few large islands where high voltage cables are used. \n \n2.  On 26 December 2004, a tsunami swept many islands of the Maldives resulting in the \nworst disaster ever to hit the country. It totally disrupted the power supply system in at least 95 \nislands (about 48% of the total islands with electricity) and left the population without electricity \nfor days before the first technical team arrived to those islands to temporarily restore the electric \npower. According to the data collected, the extent of damage varied from island to island. In \nalmost  all  affected  islands,  the  damage  occurred  to  the  distribution  network,  i.e.  cables, \ndistribution boxes, and household connections. The strong wave scoured the ground (which is \nmainly  sand),  pulled  out  the  cables  and  tore  them.  In  some  islands,  the  powerhouses, \ngenerators and switchboards were also damaged to a varying degree; some of the generators \ncan  be  repaired  and  others  have  to  be  replaced.  Streetlights  in  a  few  islands  were  also \ndamaged. \n \n3.  The damage included 24 power-houses, 104 generators capacities ranging from 20 to \n150  kilowatts  (kW),  34  switchboards,  more  than  121  km  of  cables  of  various  sizes,  632 \ndistribution  boxes,  and  652  street  lights.  The  World  Bank\u2013ADB\u2013UN  System  Joint  Needs \nAssessment Report estimated the recovery needs to be $4.6 million. \n \nB.  Project Scope \n \n4.  The  Project  component  comprises  rehabilitation  of  tsunami-damaged  power  supply \nsystem.  This  part  of  the  Project  will  cover  (i)  supply  and  installation  of  new  generators, \nswitchboards, distribution network, and streetlights; (ii) construction of powerhouses; and (iii) \nconnection to consumers. Rehabilitation works will be carried out to restore the facility to the \npre-tsunami level or to a higher standard as considered cost-effective in the long run. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n5.  The cost of immediate and short-term restoration work is about $1.0 million, which the \nGovernment can finance under quick disbursing component of the Project, while the remaining \n$3.1 million will be financed under the project component by ADB and the Government. The \nforeign exchange component comprises about $1.5 million or 48% of the total cost, while the \ntotal local currency cost is $1.6 million equivalent or 52% of the total costs, including local taxes \nand duties.

Background \n \n1.  According to the estimates prepared by the Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture, and Marine \nResources (MFAMR), the total cost for repair and rehabilitation of the damages to fisheries \nindustry from the 2004 tsunami would amount to about Rf321 million ($25.10 million equivalent) \nas shown in Table A9.1. These damage assessments and cost estimates cover repair and/or \nreplacement  of  fishing  vessels,  engines,  fishing  gear  and  accessories,  fish  processing \nequipment and infrastructure. Each atoll office has assessed the tsunami damage and reported \nto MFAMR. While there is a need for a more detailed survey to ascertain the atoll office \nassessment and verify the cost estimates, there is general agreement that the broad extent of \ndamages to fishing vessels and fish processing facilities need immediate repair. The details of \ndamage and social implications are as follows:  \n \nTable A9.1: Damage Assessment in the Fisheries Sector \n \n      Damage to  Total Damage to Infrastructure \nNo.  Type of Facility  Unit  Infrastructurea \n      Full  Part  (Rf million)  ($ million)b \n1.

The 2004 tsunami had other adverse social impacts on the fishing communities. As they \nrarely saved in banks but kept their savings at home, fishermen lost their savings when the \ntsunami hit their homes. Affected fishing communities who took loans from financial institutions \nare unable to repay their loans as they have lost their means of livelihood. Without fishing \nvessels, they cannot catch fish during the peak fishing season from January to April, nor can \nsmall-scale cottage processors produce Maldives fish during this period. The Government of \nJapan is initiating efforts to address the needs of those fishing communities who lost their \nvessels while it is proposed that ADB assist fish processors.  \n \nB.  Objective \n \n3.  The objective of the Project is to restore the livelihood of fish processors affected by the \ntsunami, who have no other source of assistance, and to strengthen their resilience to future \ndisasters and ensure their sustainable development.  \n   \n \n \n \n ", "58   Appendix 9 \nC.  Scope \n \n4.  Fish processors need immediate assistance in order to restore their livelihoods lost due \nto the tsunami. The Project aims to enable fish processors to restart their fish processing \nactivities by providing them with tools and equipment, in-kind contribution and working capital \nthrough community-based organizations (CBO) or island development committees (IDC), as \nappropriate. The Project will also provide extension and support services to help fish processors \nrestore and diversify their livelihood through development of new skills and adoption of more \nefficient processing techniques and production diversification.   \n \n5.  It is estimated that to restart their businesses, a cottage fish processor needs basic \ninputs and equipment worth about Rf20,000 and medium processors need about Rf80,000. As \nwell, working capital of up to Rf10,000 per fish processor is needed for operations and will be \nprovided through CBOs or IDCs. The MFAMR will provide CBO or IDC with the total amount of \nworking  capital  fund  required  by  each  island,  which  the  CBO  will  distribute  to  the  fish \nprocessors.  \n \n6.  MFAMR will prepare guidelines for CBO/IDC operations relevant to the assistance. The \nMFAMR will evaluate and select, in conjunction with project beneficiaries, the most suitable \nCBOs or IDCs to deliver the project inputs. The MFAMR will deposit the required amount to a \nCBO\u2019s/IDC\u2019s account in 89 affected islands based on an agreement to be signed with the PMU. \nCBO\u2019s will  be paid 2% to 4% of the total working capital fund. The MFAMR will monitor \nperformance of the CBOs, who will in turn monitor performance of individual beneficiaries. The \nProject  will  require  that  the  CBOs  register  as  cooperatives  after  the  Cooperative\u2019s  Act  is \npassed.1  \n \n7.  In order to ensure the effective use of the grant, the Project will provide technical support \nand extension services to fish processors and strengthen the institutional capacity of MFAMR. \nMFAMR will provide fish processors with training in community mobilization and management.  \n \nD.  Selection Criteria \n \n8.  MFAMR has identified fish processors in 89 islands under the fisheries component of the \nProject and prepared estimates of rehabilitation costs.2 On the basis of these estimates and field \nvisits, the Fact-finding Mission of the Project and MFAMR appraised the affected islands and \nprepared the following selection criteria for the Project: \n \n(i)  fish processors suffering from losses during the 2004 tsunami; and, \n(ii)  no overlap of assistance from donors for beneficiaries under the Project. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n \n9.  The total component cost is estimated at $3.2 million, including about $1.8 million in \nforeign exchange and $1.4 million equivalent in local currency.

The MFAMR will provide training for CBOs on \nbasic accounting (auditing, book keeping, etc), marketing, monitoring and evaluation.  A project \nconsultant will assist CBOs to graduate into commercially operating cooperatives, as soon as \nthe cooperative act has been passed into law. By giving the responsibility of managing the funds \nto the communities, a sense of ownership for the Project is fostered. Funds will be retained for \nuse in the specific communities for a range of economic activities to ensure their sustained \ndevelopment.  \n \n ", "60   Appendix 9 \n13.

Verification is ongoing and so far \n7 worst affected atolls out of 20 have been completed. The affected fish processors will be \nprovided with equipment and utensils through CBOs/IDCs in each island. The CBO/IDC will (i) \ncreate awareness among the island community about the Project, (iii) report to MFAMR on the \nrequirements of affected communities, (iv) distribute inputs and tools to individual processors \nselected under the Project, (v) provide working capital grants to individual fish processors, and \n(vi) maintain and manage a separate account for the Project with the regional branch of the \nBank of Maldives. Equipment and utensils for project beneficiaries will be procured centrally by \nthe NERRP. \n \n14.  The Project will strengthen the institutional capacity of MFAMR to provide technical \nsupport and extension services to the affected fish processors. This component of the Project \nincludes (i) services of an international fisheries marketing specialist for a period of 1 month and \nan international community development specialist for 2 months, (ii) services of a domestic \ncommunity  development  specialist  for  24  months  and  a  domestic  extension  officer  for  12 \nmonths, (iii) provide funds for the operation of 3 mobile extension service teams for a period of \n24 months, (iv) purchase of equipment for delivery of training; and (v) short term overseas \ntraining of extension officers. \n \n15.  The fisheries component will be implemented over a period of 2 years. Most of grant \nactivities are expected to start in April 2005 and be completed by December 2005; but the fish \nprocessing extension activities will be completed by March 2007. \n \n16.

Background \n \n1.  Agriculture sector was badly hit, as the basic natural resources of agriculture (soil and \nwater)  are  affected  by  the  tsunami  waves  causing  temporary,  semi-permanent  or  even \npermanent damage to these resources. Destruction to home gardens, standing crops, arable \nland and groundwater, loss of farming equipment and damage to agriculture infrastructure are \nsubstantial. The related decline in production and yield levels of field and other crops, including \nhomestead cultivation such as breadfruit, mango and other fruit trees, is significant. Table A10.1 \nprovides extent of damage to agricultural islands. \n \n2.  The Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture, and Marine Resources (MFAMR) has identified 68 \nislands where field crop was affected by the tsunami, and 115 islands where perennials and fruit \ntrees were affected and need to restore them to their condition prior to the tsunami. \n \n3.  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  is  processing  emergency \nassistance addressing less seriously affected perennials in 42 islands, while Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction assistance is being processed to address farmers in 26 most affected islands \nengaged in field crops.

The objective of this component is to enable farmers engaged in field crops in 42 less \nseverely affected islands and farmers engaged in perennials in 26 most severely affected \nislands whose livelihood were destroyed, restart their agricultural activities and restore their lost \nlivelihoods. It aims also to assist affected farm families to diversify and adopt improved farming \ntechnology to ensure sustainability. \n \n ", "62   Appendix 10 \nC.  Scope \n \n5.  The Project will provide farm inputs (seeds and fertilizers), tools and equipment lost due \nto the disaster. It will also provide working capital and support extension services to help \naffected farmers. The tsunami-affected farmers, who lost annual crops, perennial crops and fruit \ntrees, need basic inputs and equipment with up to Rf20,000. They will receive working capital as \nmicrocredit to prepare with planting their crops, which will be equivalent to 15% of the inputs \nand equipment.    \n \n6.  In order to ensure the effective use of working capital, MFAMR will evaluate and select, \nin  conjunction  with  project  beneficiaries,  the  most  suitable  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs) or Island Development Centers (IDCs) to deliver the project inputs. The MFAMR will \ndeposit the required amount to a CBO\u2019s/IDC\u2019s account based on a credit agreement to be \nsigned with the project (PIU).1 CBO\u2019s will be paid 2% to 4% of the total working capital fund as \nadministration fee. The MFAMR will monitor performance of the CBOs, who will in turn monitor \nperformance of individual processors/borrowers. The Project will require that the CBOs register \nas cooperatives as soon as the legal framework of Cooperatives is passed.2 \n  \n7.  MFAMR will provide extension services to farmers through the services of three mobile \nextension  service  teams,  and  strengthen  its  institutional  capacity  with  the  services  of  an \nagronomist and a community development specialist. The extension services will identify the \ncontaminated soil and groundwater conditions in the islands and provide suitable cultivation \nmethods to cope with the problem facing the farmers. The Project will provide CBO/IDC with \ntraining in community mobilization and management and micro-finance operations.  \n \nD.  Selection Criteria \n \n8.  MFARM has identified 115 islands in 11 atolls3 under the agriculture component of the \nProject and prepared estimates of rehabilitation costs. On the basis of these estimates and field \nvisits, the Fact-finding Mission of the Project and MFAMR appraised the affected islands and \nprepared the following criteria for the Project: \n \n(i)  islands that suffered from serious damage in the 2004 tsunami; \n(ii)  affected farmers who will be identified by MFARM and verified by the task force \nand/or the atoll office; \n(iii)  no overlap of assistance from other donors for beneficiaries under the Project; \nand \n(iv)  farms are located in the115 islands affected by the tsunami. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n \n9.  The total component cost is tentatively estimated at $3.1 million, including about $2.1 \nmillion in foreign exchange and $1.0 million equivalent in local currency. The cost summary is \nshown in Table A10.2.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The number of the affected islands may change after further verification. \n2  CBOs in islands may not be primarily fisheries. \n3  May change with further verification.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT).  The \nProgram will be coordinated and monitored through the Economic Recovery and Reconstruction \nProgram  Office  of  MOFT,  of  which,  MFAMR  is  a  member.  The  Implementing  Agency  is \nMFAMR.  The  Agricultural  Training  and  Extension  Unit  of  the  MFARM  will  be  the  Project \nImplementation Unit (PIU) and will report to the Director, Agriculture Unit who will be overall \nresponsible for coordinating and monitoring Project activities. At the field level, responsibility for \nimplementing the Project will rest with the regional development management offices and atoll \noffices and CBO/IDC.  \n \n12.  The agriculture component will be implemented over a period of 2 years. Most of grant \nactivities are expected to start in April 2005 and be completed by December 2005; but the \nagriculture extension activities will be completed by March 2007. \n \n13.  MFARM will identify the tsunami-affected farmers in 42 less severely affected islands for \nfield crops and 26 severely affected islands for perennial crops and fruit trees. Based on the \nNational Disaster Management Center\u2019s information, MFAMR will verify the affected farmers \nthrough field visits. The affected farmers will be provided with agriculture inputs, including \nseeds, fertilizers, tools and equipment through existing organizations or newly created CBO in \neach island. The CBO will (i) create awareness and inform the island community about the \nProject, (iii) report to MFAMR on its requirements, (iv) distribute inputs and tools to individual \nfarmers, (v) distribute grants to individual farmers, and (vi) maintain and manage a separate \n ", "64   Appendix 10 \naccount  for  the  Project.  The  NERRP  will  procure  centrally  agriculture  inputs,  tools,  and \nequipment. \n \n14.  The Project will strengthen the institutional capacity of MFAMR to provide technical \nsupport and extension services to the affected communities. This component of the Project \nincludes (i) services of an international agronomist for a period of 6 months; (ii) services of a \ndomestic community development specialist for a period of 12 months; and (iii) funds for the \noperation of 3 mobile extension service teams for a period of 24 months. \n \n15.  The  NERRP  will  monitor  overall  progress  of  project  implementation,  and  provide \nquarterly progress reports to ADB to indicate the progress made and problems encountered \nduring the period under review, the steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the \nproposed program of activities, and the expected progress during the following quarter. The \nCBO will report to the MFAMR on its activities, including all its procurements, disbursements \nand repayments. The MFAMR will offer advice and assistance to the CBOs, and evaluate the \neffectiveness  of  the  scheme  on  a  regular  basis  through  site  visits  and  consultations  with \nbeneficiary communities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  65 \nCOST ESTIMATES \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nCategory    Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

No    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Maldives: \nThe Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project (the Project) is a grant and loan assistance that consists of two \ncomponents: (i) $6.5 million for quick disbursement assistance; and (ii) prompt restoration and reconstruction of \ntsunami-related damages in five sectors\u2014water supply, sanitation and solid waste management; transport; power; \nagriculture; and fisheries. The Project will reduce the increased risk of poverty by helping affected people reduce \ntheir vulnerability to the tsunami-related shocks (i.e., unclean environment and related illnesses, damaged maritime \nand air infrastructure limiting safe travel, damaged public utilities and discontinued power supply, and destroyed \nlivelihoods). Poor and disadvantaged households, especially female-headed households, are more vulnerable to \nthese shocks and face a greater risk of becoming further marginalized. ADB\u2019s medium and long-term post-tsunami \nassistance will be adjusted to support Government priority to be envisaged in the planned 7th National Development \nPlan (2006\u20132010). The next Maldives Country Strategy and Program (CSP), scheduled for 2006, will consider the \nnew 7th National Development Plan and Government\u2019s post-tsunami strategy. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nThe Maldives has experienced rapid economic growth over the past 25 years. Gross domestic product (GDP) \nmaintained an average annual growth of about 9% per year primarily due to the development and expansion of \ntourism, fisheries, and service industry. However, geographical challenges have led to unbalanced economic growth \nand poverty in the country. With a population of about 300 thousand people, the Maldives is an archipelago that \nconsists of about 1,192 islands spread across 860 km. Regional disparities can be seen in terms of absolute \npoverty, and social and physical development. An estimated 70% of the population outside of Mal\u00e9 has an income \nequivalent to the bottom 20% in Mal\u00e9 (VPA 1998). The cost of providing infrastructure and quality services remains \nhigh and ineffective due to a dispersed population and the remoteness of some islands. Global warming also \nthreatens many islands in the Maldives, as most are located just above sea level. A lack of infrastructure, social \nservices, and rising sea levels fuels migration to Mal\u00e9.  \n \nPre-tsunami, absolute poverty under the poverty line of Rf15 per person per day decreased from 43% in 1997 to \nabout 22% in 2004, based on preliminary results of the Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment (VPA) 2004 data.1 As \na result of the Tsunami on 26 December 2004, absolute poverty is likely to increase the number of poor below the \npoverty line of Rf15 per person per day. The Tsunami significantly damaged about 39 islands, of which about 14 \nislands were completely destroyed. About 100 thousand of the population was severely affected. About 7% of the \npopulation has been displaced\u2014close to 12,000 people have been displaced from their islands, and another 8,500 \npeople are temporarily relocated to other places on their own island. The Ministry of Gender, Family Development, \nand Social Security is providing emergency cash payments of Rf1,500, Rf1,000 and Rf500 per person based on the \nlevel of damage caused by the tsunami on housing structure. Public infrastructure and services were damaged and \ndisrupted (i.e., ports and harbors, power supply, and water supply). Livelihoods and service jobs were also affected, \nas many rely on tourism and fishing industries. For instance, about 18% of the total labor force is engaged in \nprimary fishing activities, but almost 98% of employment in the fisheries sector is found in the atolls (VPA 1998). \nDamaged infrastructure systems pose serious environmental and health risks and inhibit social and economic \ndevelopment of individuals living in 20 administrative atolls. The estimated cost of tsunami-related damages is about \n$470 million (about 60% of the GDP), of which about $298 million are for direct damages.  \n \nThe Project will help restore access to public infrastructure and services. It will help maintain clean living conditions \nthrough community-based water supply, sanitation and solid waste management programs. The Project will also \nhelp re-establish lost agricultural and fishing incomes through livelihood programs targeted at agricultural and \nfishing individuals. Interventions proposed within each sector will help restore the livelihoods of many tsunami-\naffected and internally displaced people. By reducing the risk of vulnerability, the Project will also help to restore \nconfidence levels and self-dignity of people and communities adversely affected by the tsunami. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was done to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and the ways in \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Planning and National Development. 1998. Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment (VPA). Mal\u00e8. Based \non the VPA (1998), income poverty is illustrated using 3 poverty lines: 15% of the population live below Rf7.5 \n($0.59) poverty line, 22% below Rf10 ($0.78), and 43% below Rf15 ($1.17). The VPA 2004 data has been \ncompleted but has not yet been published. \n ", "76  Appendix 16 \nwhich they affect project feasibility and success. Primary stakeholders include: tsunami-affected people (i.e., \nwomen, vulnerable groups, water users, home agricultural and fishing communities); non-affected island and atoll \nresidents; and tourists. Secondary stakeholders include: Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT); Ministry of \nPlanning and National Development; Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Environment and Construction in the water \nsupply, sanitation and solid waste management sector; Ministry of Communication (MOC) and Ministry of Transport \nand Civil Aviation (MTCA) in transport sector; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Marine Resources (MAFMR) in \nagriculture and fisheries sectors; State Electricity Company Limited in power sector; Ministry of Atolls Development \n(MOAD); Ministry of Gender, Family Development and Social Security; and civil society,2 including nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), community groups, and development committees at all administrative levels. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA participation strategy is integrated into the overall Project design. MOFT will coordinate with various Ministries \nduring project implementation. The Project will adopt a sector-like approach, covering five key sectors\u2014water \nsupply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management;  transport;  agriculture;  fisheries;  and  power.3  Administrative \nplanning will be centralized, while implementation will consider views of different stakeholder. Atoll, island, and \nwomen\u2019s committees will participate during project design to help maximize project benefits for their communities, \nespecially vulnerable groups. Procedures for subproject selection are outlined in Appendix 12. As specified as part \nof the subproject proposal selection criteria, beneficiaries will be consulted and their views incorporated into the \nselection process of subprojects. Each sector includes details of how different stakeholders will participate during \nproject implementation, operation, and maintenance, thereby fostering ownership and social cohesion. Participatory \napproaches will be used in designing subprojects, implementation, operation and maintenance, and monitoring and \nevaluation arrangements. The process will involve information sharing, consultations, interviews, focus group \nmeetings, and collaborative decision-making. The Project builds on the strong social capital demonstrated during \nthe immediate aftermath of the tsunami by encouraging partnerships with community groups, island communities, \nand other stakeholders. The summary initial environmental examination (Appendix 17) and resettlement framework \n(Appendix 18) also include participatory actions. An international community development specialist will be engaged \nfor 1 person-month, and a national social and gender specialist for 6 person-months to help support and coordinate \nparticipatory activities of communities across all sectors during project implementation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nMalidivian women make up close to 49% of the total population, and close to 52% of the tsunami-affected \npopulation in 20 atolls. Female-headed households make up about 46% of the total number of households due to \nmarital status, or absentee husband that migrated for work and/or were absent at the time of the census. There are \nno visible gender disparities in the provision of basic health care and education. Over the last 30 years, literacy rate \nof females aged 15 and above reached 97%. Maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births reduced from 480 in \n1990 to 75 in 2000. However, gender disparities are found in some areas such as levels of nutritional intake, school \nperformance and educational attainment levels. For example, anemia affects about 51% of the female population \nand indirectly contributes to maternal mortality. \n \nWomen play important roles in economic activities, and are responsible for a variety of domestic tasks. They often \nengage in home gardening of agricultural products (i.e., curry leaves, fruits, and vegetables), and in fish processing. \nThese items may be kept for home-use, given to others free of charge, or sold to a middleman for sale in another \nisland market. Women also hold government positions, with some representation at high levels: two women are \nmembers of the cabinet (i.e., Ministry of Health and Ministry of Gender, Family Development and Social Security), \nand one is an atoll leader. A gender policy for the Maldives has been formulated and is in the process of being \napproved. Women also participate in community affairs and in the island\u2019s women\u2019s committee.  \n \nAbout 4% of all employees in tourism are women. A shift to a service-oriented economy has caused more women to \nenter the labor work force. According the World Bank-ADB-UN systems joint needs assessment, labor force \nparticipation rate (LFPR) for women rose by 9% from 1995 to 2000. Even with this increase there is considerable \ngender disparity in LFPR with male comprising 71.1% and females 37.4% (2000). The VPA 2004 data indicates a \nrise in unemployment rate since 1997 for both men and women, indicating an increase in the number of both willing \nto work. About 28% of the female labor force is unemployed in the atolls, compared to 14% in Mal\u00e9 (VPA 2004 \ndata). About 9% of the male labor force in the atolls are unemployed, compared to the 7% in Mal\u00e9.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n2 In the aftermath of the tsunami, the NGO sector formed an NGO forum that consists of about 12 NGOs. The forum \nwas formed for better communication, coordination of emergency response, and building on one another\u2019s skills.  \n3 The World Bank and the UN system are providing emergency assistance to the education and health sectors. Other \nbilateral donors and NGOs are also providing assistance to these sectors and other sectors in the Maldives. ", "  Appendix 16  77 \nDuring post-tsunami reconstruction, the involvement of women is essential in order to prevent any adverse affects \non their daily lives. Those holding government jobs remain unaffected, but for others, salinity of home gardens and \ndamage to fish processing equipment has made it difficult for women to continue their livelihoods activities. Because \nmen\u2019s work is more visible, there is a danger that asset replacement during the recovery phase could ignore those \nassets essential to women\u2019s income income-generating activities at home (i.e., sewing or catering). Men have been \nable to continue fishing activities, as damage to vessels was not severe.  \n \nThe Project is expected to benefit women equally, to provide women with equal opportunities and pay for \nemployment, and to support women\u2019s participation during project implementation. A number of rainwater tanks were \naffected by the tsunami, thereby affecting the quality of water for households. Unclean water and poor sanitary \nconditions following the tsunami could adversely impact the health status of women and families. The reconstruction \nof power and maritime infrastructure (i.e., restoration of electricity and seawalls) will restore the labor saving \ntechnologies through power supply and livelihoods for those who engage in fisheries. Infrastructure improvements \nwill protect fishing vessels, and restore access to markets, extension social services, and information. Repair of air \ninfrastructure will improve airport safety, which would help support the tourism industry. It will support cash-for-work, \nwhere priority for unskilled labor generated by the Project will be given to those affected by the tsunami. Women will \nhave equal access to job opportunities and equal pay. Such short-term employment will be important for women \nwho find it difficult to reestablish their livelihoods while living in temporary shelters. All sectors have taken gender \ninto consideration so to avoid exacerbating disparities during post-tsunami reconstruction.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nE.

The objective of the proposed Project is to support to the efforts of the Government of \nThe Maldives in providing for basic needs and services and rehabilitating essential infrastructure \ndamaged by Indian Ocean tsunami which hit the country on 26 December 2004.  The Project \nwill follow a sector approach to facilitate selection of the highest priority subprojects during \nimplementation.  The  present  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reviews  the  potential \ndegree of likely environmental impacts resulting from proposed interventions and describes \npossible mitigation measures for the Project. Subprojects site selection, detailed design and \nspecific construction and operation activities will be determined during project implementation. \nEnvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  were  prepared  to  guide  subproject \nenvironmental screening and environmental compliance with requirements prescribed in the \nGovernment of the Maldives legal framework and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Environmental \nPolicy (2002)1 and guidelines (2003).2 \n \nB.  Description of Project \n \n2.  The Project will contribute to economic growth recovery from the tsunami devastating \nimpact through (i) rehabilitating basic infrastructure and services in the islands, and (ii) restoring \neconomic activity in affected areas. Because of emergency requirements, the Project will not \nfollow conventional ADB requirements leading to the preparation of sample subproject IEEs. \nThe Project\u2019s IEE provides overall preliminary scooping, highlighting potential key environmental \nissues to be further explored during subproject formulation. Table A17.1 summarizes the scope \nof work proposed for project components.  \n \nTable A17.1: Project Components \n \n  Project Components  Scope of Work \nA.  Transport Infrastructure  Rehabilitate transport and communications infrastructure and \nprovide support for the recovery of maritime transport activities. \nMain activities will include repair of priority causeways, jetties \nand seawalls, airport navigation and communications \nequipment, and rehabilitation of naval aids. \nB.  Water Supply,  Rehabilitate and provide water supply (water tanks and \nSanitation and Solid  rainwater harvesting gutters and piping), sanitation (septic tanks, \nWaste Management  sewerage network small bore, outfall piping, reed-beds) and \nsolid waste management (communal bins, composter, \ncompactors) equipment and infrastructure and services for \ncommunities in most affected islands. \nC.  Power  Rehabilitate power infrastructure in affected islands. This will \nconsist mostly in the provision of generators, cables and power \nhouse equipment. No transformers or high voltage switchgear. \nD.  Agriculture and  Rehabilitation of livelihoods and economic recovery of affected \nFisheries  communities through provision of support for replacing farm \ninputs, tools and equipment lost and community-based fish \nprocessing facilities. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Environmental Policy. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. ", "  Appendix 17  79 \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n  1.   Physical Resources \n \n3.  The 1,192 low-lying coral islands of the Maldives archipelago extend over 26 atolls \ncovering an area of 115,300 square kilometers (km2). The islands stretch over a distance of 860 \nkilometers (km) north to south, and 130 km east to west. The average area of the 199 inhabited \nislands is 57.8 hectares (ha) and only 3 islands exceed an area of 400 ha. The maximum \nelevation is below 3 meters (m) above mean sea level and most (80%) of the land is less than \n1m above mean high tide level. Thirteen of the atolls lie within the three Central Regions. Inside \nthe  atolls,  water  depth  is  generally  less  than  80  m.  The  islands  comprise  layers  of \nunconsolidated shell and coral sand and debris, lying on coral rock, which are normally less \nthan 10 m below the surface. Soils are thin (20 centimeters or less) freely draining and highly \nalkaline. There is abundant calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus; and sufficient iron. The \ntropical climate is dominated by two monsoon periods. Temperature ranges between 25-30 \ndegrees Celsius, and rainfall is about 2000 millimeters per annum. Water on the islands occurs \nalmost entirely as groundwater within the aquifer that overlies the coral rock.   \n   \n  2.   Ecological Resources \n \n4.  The Maldives displays a pristine marine environment. The well being of the coral reef, \nthe 7th largest in the world covering a total area of 8,920 km2 and contributing to 5% of the \nworld\u2019s reef area, is of concern at national and international levels. Marine biological diversity is \nexceptional  and  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  world\u2019s  richest  ecosystems.  Most  recent \naccounts recognize 187 species of stony coral, 1,090 species of fish, and almost 300 species of \nmarine algae, 36 species of sponges, little over 400 species of mollusks and 350 species of \nmarine crustaceans. There are also 7 species of dolphins, 9 species of whales, and 5 species of \nturtles, all of which endangered. The diversity of terrestrial ecosystems is limited by the small \nsize of the land areas, shallow depth of the soil, and the relatively high soil salinity. In spite of \nthis, more than 583 species of plants are found in the Maldives, of which 260 native species are \nrecorded, and over 190 species of birds species are recorded, 9 of which are protected under \nthe  Environmental  Law.  Between  1995  and  1999,  25  \u2018Protected  Dive  Marine  Sites\u2019  were \ndelineated in the Maldives. \n   \n  3.   Human and Economic Development \n \n5.   Tourism and fisheries are the cornerstones of the national economy. While fishing \nactivity is well distributed nationally, about 75% of the tourist resorts lie within the Central \nRegion, and within relatively easy reach of Mal\u00e9 Hulhul\u00e9 International Airport. Mal\u00e9 is the \ntransportation hub for all forms of transport. Tuna fisheries and the associated bait-fish fishing is \na major industry in the Maldives accounting for a large but slowly declining proportion of the \nnational economy. Agriculture including timber (mainly coconut), is of relatively minor economic \nimportance and is also in slow decline. Apart from fisheries and tourism, there is little other \nindustry except for ship building and ship maintenance in the atoll islands.  \n \n6.   The national capital Mal\u00e9 (population 74,069 in 2000 Census) lies roughly at the mid \npoint of the Central Regions and is the focus for virtually all of the industrial and commercial \nactivity of the Maldives. The fact that 38% of the total population was enrolled at an educational \ninstitute in 2002, indicates the value placed on education. Focus Islands provide education up to \nsecondary standard but for post-secondary education students have to go to Mal\u00e9.  \n ", "80  Appendix 17 \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  In agreement with the Project\u2019s main objective of rehabilitating and restoring facilities \nand infrastructure damaged by the tsunami, a substantial overall positive environmental impact \nis  expected  as  a  result  of  the  outcomes  of  the  Project.  Rehabilitation  of  small  maritime \ninfrastructure and potential causeways will be within the right of way and will not lead to \nrealignment and widening, focusing on damaged sections.  \n \n8.  Reversible short-term minor negative impacts on population and terrestrial animals may \nrelate to civil works during the construction phase, such as would be equipment vibration, dust \nand noise generation. Preventing contamination of the freshwater lens and preventing further \ndepletion will be a crucial priority, for which monitoring will need to be provided. Location of solid \nwaste management facilities, reed bed sewage treatment (below ground level) in selected, \nrequiring  large  areas,  and  sludge  drying  beds  may  result  in  potential  odor  problems  in  a \nconfined island context. The location of such facilities will be selected in consultation with \nauthorities and the local population. Moreover, a buffer zone with appropriate vegetation will be \nincorporated, where possible, to attenuate nuisance and improve aesthetics. A summary list of \nimpacts throughout design, construction and operation of proposed facilities is attached in Table \n17.2. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n   \n1.  Institutional Requirements \n \n9.  In  accordance  to  Law  4/93,  the  Environment  Protection  and  Preservation  Act  of \nMaldives, all activities to be implemented as a result of tsunami damage should take due \nconsiderations of the guidelines provided by the government authorities, and specifically the \nMinistry  of  Environment  and  Construction  (MEC).  According  to  the  law,  MEC  and  other \nconcerned  government  authorities  shall  provide  the  necessary  guidelines  and  advice  on \nenvironmental  protection  and  will  indicate  for  given  subprojects  whether  an  IEE  or \nenvironmental impacts assessment are required. In such cases, these will be prepared and \nsubmitted to MEC.  \n \n10.  The project management unit (PMU) under the executing agency will be responsible for \ncarrying  out  environmental  assessment  reports  and  their  summaries,  implementing  and \nmonitoring mitigation measures and reporting to ADB for review. Technical and institutional \nmitigation measures will be incorporated in the detailed design of the Project. Measures of a \nplanning, functional, institutional, and procedural character have to be included in the site \nselection criteria, tender documents and OHSP. Mitigation measures related to construction will \nbe stated in the contract with the Contractor, who will be responsible for the implementation of \nits  own  environmental  management  plan.  MEC  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  overall \nenvironmental compliance and general ecosystems and environmental monitoring. \n \n  2.   Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n11.  Environmental expertise will be provided by a suitably qualified member of staff of MEC, \nwhich  will  assist  the  PMU  providing  guidance,  review  of  subproject  proposals  and  where \nnecessary undertake the preparation of environmental assessments and implementation of \nmitigation measures. During the construction and implementation phase, the PMU will provide \nquarterly  reporting  on  the  implementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  their \nmonitoring.  ", "  Appendix 17  81 \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n12.  Because of the emergency nature of the Project, detailed public consultation with a large \nsub-sample of stakeholders in the atolls could not be undertaken. Nevertheless meetings during \nthe formulation of the Project with concerned Government agencies, bilateral agencies, NGOs \nand individuals from selected affected islands, confirmed wide interest regarding the proposed \nactivities, as many of these are also seen to be providing the necessary framework to help \nimprove the standard of living of island-affected communities and prevent further marine and \nterrestrial contamination. \n \n13.  During  subproject  design  and  prior  to  initiating  construction,  consultations  with \nconcerned island communities will be conducted. Environmental reports will be shared with the \ncommunities and their views and concerns reflected in the design and implementation stages.  \n \nG.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures for Proposed Subprojects \n \n14.  Environmental assessment and review procedures have been produced to help guide \nenvironmental screening and subproject design, ensuring compliance with the environmental \nassessment requirements of the Government and ADB. Road and jetty subprojects will focus on \nthe rehabilitation of damaged sections and not cover extensive length. No subprojects will be \nimplemented inside, in the buffer zone or in the immediate vicinity of designated protected \nareas.  Activities  with  significant  impact  on  ecosystems,  such  as  dredging,  will  not  be \nconsidered. Therefore, subprojects are unlikely to have environmentally significant impacts and \nthe  Project  is  considered  to  be  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  environmental  classification.  All \nsubprojects will be subject to screening for environmental impacts, which will determine whether \nan IEE is necessary. \n \nH.  Findings, Recommendations and Conclusion \n \n15.  The Project mostly focuses on reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. \nThere are some minor and short-term potentially adverse impacts which could be potentially \nassociated with some of the proposed activities but these are considered to be controllable \nthrough enforcement of appropriate construction contract conditions. Significant environmental \nbenefits may derive from reduced sedimentation erosion and provision of adequate sanitation \nand  solid  waste  management  facilities.  The  IEE  shows  that  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are foreseen to be associated with the proposed rehabilitation work, and \ntherefore the need for a full scale environmental impact assessment is unlikely to be required. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "82  Appendix 17 \nTable A17.2: Summary of Environmental Impacts, Mitigation Measures,  \nand Monitoring Plan \n \nPhase  Potential Impacts  Proposed Mitigation Measure  Monitoring  Frequency \nDesign and  Transport       \nLocation  Protection work and sea  Passive structures should be  Design consultants  Periodic \nwalls may have  well aligned with the direction of  (specification)  monitoring \nmorphological impacts in  the flow in order to minimize    during \nthe diversion of sea currents  bank erosion.

The Tsunami displaced more than 12,500 persons from their islands and knocked down \nabout 4,000 houses in Maldives. It also damaged the income and livelihood sources of about \n100,000 people. The Resettlement Framework (RF) outlines the resettlement policy principles, \nprocedures, and institutional arrangements for relocation, and income and livelihood restoration.  \n \nA.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n2.  The  Project  does  not  include  the  relocation  of  displaced  persons.  However,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy is applicable to the relocation of displaced households as such \nrelocation is an associated activity of the Project. The Government\u2019s policy on resettlement of \ndisplaced  and  affected  people  rules  out  involuntary  resettlement  of  displaced  or  affected \npersons. The Government\u2019s \u201cguiding principles for resettlement\u201d are: (i) improve or at least \nrestore the incomes and livelihood of relocated persons; (ii) conduct socioeconomic surveys to \nidentify and assess the Tsunami impacts on affected people; (iii) inform them as well as host \npopulations of their entitlements; (iv) consult them on relocation options; (v) pay compensation \nat mutually-agreed rates for all lost assets; (vi) assist their relocation by providing transitional \nsupport and development assistance such as land preparation, credit facilities and skill training; \n(vii) provide civic infrastructure and community services; (viii) disclose relocation/resettlement \nplans to both relocating persons and their host communities; and (xi) provide resettlement \nentitlements to each affected household as \u201can agreed lump sum amount of money\u201d before their \nrelocation or return to their original dwellings. The above policy principles broadly match that of \nthe ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n3.  The \u201cguiding principles for resettlement\u201d prescribes assistance to displaced households: \n(i) to rebuild houses on their resident islands, if internally displaced; (ii) to relocate on \u2018safe\u2019 \nislands if the resident islands are unsafe, or (iii) to return to resident islands from temporary \n\u2018safe\u2019  islands  and  rebuild  houses.  All  displaced  households  will  get  livelihood  support, \ndevelopment  assistance,  civic  \u2018infrastructure\u2019  and  access  to  \u2018socioeconomic  services  and \nutilities. \n \nTable A18: Entitlement Matrix \n \nType of Loss  Application  Definition of   Entitlement  Implementation \nPeople Affected  Issues \n1.

The PMU will involve NGOs, leaders and representatives of \natoll and island \u2018associations\u2019, and other CBOs to monitor the relocation, reconstruction and \nlivelihood recovery programs. The PMU will have a \u2018relocation unit\u2019 within PMU to assist the \nrelocation programs and to monitor progress.   \n \n5.  The EA will prepare a satisfactory resettlement plan (RP) as per the agreed RF before \nacquiring any land, changing land use patterns or restricting peoples access to common land for \nthe purposes of the Project.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Project is categorized as environmental category B. As the Project follows a sector-\nlike approach, procedures for environmental assessment for sector loans have been adopted. \nAn overall initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken as a part of the feasibility \nstudy for assessment of generic impacts of each subcomponent. The overall IEE shows that the \nimpacts of the Project are expected to be positive especially for the component on water supply, \nsanitation and solid waste management. It also shows that no significant adverse environmental \nimpacts  are  anticipated  from  other  components  and  subcomponents,  and  a  detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. Given the emergency nature of the Project, \nsubproject specific IEEs could not be prepared to serve as demonstration for preparation of \nIEEs and summary IEEs during project implementation, but this will be developed as part of \nproject implementation.  \n \n2.  This Environmental Assessment Framework (EAF) has been prepared to guide the \nenvironmental assessment of subprojects for each subcomponent and facilitate compliance with \nenvironmental requirements of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Republic of the \nMaldives during implementation.  \n \nB.  Overview of Type of Subprojects to be Assessed \n \n3.  The proposed Project have 5 main components: (i) water supply, sanitation and solid \nwaste management; (ii) transport; (iii) power; (iv) agriculture; and (v) fisheries. The Project area \nwould include up to 130 islands throughout the country (out of a total of 200 inhabited islands). \nEnvironmental assessment requirements are applied to all the subprojects under Components: \n \n(i)  Water Supply, Sanitation and Solid Waste Management  \n(a)  provision  of  community  and  household  rainwater  tanks  and  rainwater \nharvesting equipment, \n(b)  provision  of  basic  temporary  sanitation  facilities  and  rehabilitation  of \nexisting sanitation infrastructure, \n(c)  rehabilitation and reconstruction of environmental infrastructure damaged \nby the tsunami (including sewage systems, networks and outfalls), and \nenvironmental improvement facilities, and \n(d)  provision of solid waste management equipment, establishment of solid \nwaste management systems and facilities, and training for clearing and \nrecovery of debris material.  \n \n(ii)  Transport  \n(a)  rehabilitation/reinstatement  of  maritime  navigation  aids  damaged  or \ndestroyed; \n(b)  procurement  of  emergency  inter-island  transportation  capacity  for \nreconstruction works; \n(c)  priority repairs in causeways; and \n(d)  priority dredging of harbor basis and approach channels, rehabilitation of \ndamaged jetties, priority repairs on sea walls and quay walls, and  \n(e)  rehabilitation of Mal\u00e9 International Airport. \n ", "90  Appendix 19 \n(iii)  Power  \n(a)  supply  and  installation  of  new  generators,  switchboards,  distribution \nnetwork, and streetlights; \n(b)  construction of island community powerhouses; and \n(c)  connection to consumers \n \n(iv)  Agriculture and (v) Fisheries  \n(a)  provide farm inputs (seeds and fertilizers), tools and equipment lost due \nto the disaster; \n(b)  provide working capital and support extension services to help affected \nfarmers; and \n(c)  provide  fish  processing  tools  and  equipment,  in-kind  contribution  and \nworking capital through community based organizations. \n \nC.  Specific Procedure of Environmental Assessment to be used for Subprojects \nunder the Project \n \n  1.  Responsibilities, Authorities, and Procedure for Environmental  \n    Assessment of Subprojects \n \n4.  An environmental assessment report (EAR) will be carried out for each subproject under \nall components during the Project implementation. Careful screening of potential subprojects will \nbe conducted based on the EAR review. The environmental impact analysis for each proposed \nsubproject will be conducted by an agency or individual with EIA certifications in the Maldives. \nFor each of the subprojects, the EAR will include specific mitigation measures and financial \nsources  as  pre-requisite  for  approval  of  credit,  and  implementation  of  monitoring  and \nenforcement program will be developed to ensure that none of the Project components would \nhave any major adverse environmental impacts.  \n \n5.  Public consultation will be conducted through interviews, meetings, or surveys as part of \nenvironmental assessment for each subproject based on the public involvement procedures and \nguidelines established by MEC and in agreement with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The \nresults of public consultation will be documented and reflected in EAR. \n \n6.  In  accordance  to  Law  4/93,  the  Environment  Protection  and  Preservation  Act  of \nMaldives, all activities to be implemented as a result of tsunami damage should take due \nconsiderations of the guidelines provided by the government authorities, and specifically the \nMinistry  of  Environment  and  Construction  (MEC).  According  to  the  law,  MEC  and  other \nconcerned  government  authorities  shall  provide  the  necessary  guidelines  and  advice  on \nenvironmental protection and will indicate for given subprojects whether an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) or environmental impact assessment (EIA) are required, which will conform \nthe so-called EAR. In such cases, these will be prepared and submitted to MEC for review and \nendorsement. ADB will review the first 2 subproject IEEs formulated for each component and \nany  proposed  EIA  and  suggest  changes  or  provide  endorsement.  Projects  with  significant \nenvironmental impact on the environment may not be eligible for funding under the Project. \n \n7.  The project management unit (PMU) under the executing agency will be responsible for \ncarrying  out  environmental  assessment  reports  and  their  summaries,  implementing  and \nmonitoring mitigation measures and reporting to ADB for review. Technical and institutional \nmitigation measures will be incorporated in the detailed design of the Project. Measures of a \nplanning, functional, institutional, and procedural character have to be included in the site ", "  Appendix 19  91 \nselection criteria, tender documents and OHSP. Mitigation measures related to construction will \nbe stated in the contract with the Contractor, who will be responsible for the implementation of \nits  own  environmental  management  plan.  MEC  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  overall \nenvironmental compliance and general ecosystems and environmental monitoring. \n \n2.  Environmental Criteria of Subproject Selection \n \n8.  The following table summarizes environmental criteria for subproject selection: \n \nOverall Requirements \nNo subproject of the investment component will entail new damage to marine or terrestrial \nenvironment consider of significance importance, be located in core or buffer areas of existing \nmarine  protected  sites,  nor  seek  to  replace  any  of  natural  ecosystems  with  designed \nagricultural/fish processing systems and infrastructure. Where the proposed interventions may \nlead  to  nuisances  to the  surrounding  population  (e.g.  solid  waste management  centers  or \nsewage treatment facilities), these will be located at an appropriate distance from population \ncenters  and  meet  the  national  and  local  environmental  standards.  No  subprojects  will  be \nimplemented in the core or buffer zone or in the immediate vicinity of designated protected \nareas. Activities with significant impact on ecosystems, such as land reclamation, will not be \nconsidered. An environmental assessment report (EAR) will be carried out for each subproject \nand submitted to MEC for review and approval. Where necessary, the EAR will include an \nEnvironmental Management Plan (EMP) with specific mitigation measures and financial sources \nas  pre-requisite  for  approval  of  credit,  and  implementation  of  monitoring  and  enforcement \nprogram will be developed to ensure that none of the Project activities would have any major \nadverse environmental impacts.
