INTRODUCTION\n1. The  Pan-Beibu  Gulf (PBG)  economic cooperation  was  launched jointly by  the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  member  states  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN), and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 2006.1Since then, ADB has provided \nsupport to PBG economic cooperation in various forms, including technical assistance (TA)2that\nsupports the work of the PBG Joint Expert Group.3 This regional policy and advisory TA is \nproposed in response to requests by the governments of the ASEAN countries and the PRC for \nADB to continue its support for PBGcooperation. Consultations were conducted with the ASEAN \ncountries and the PRC on various occasions to determine the impact, outcome, outputs, and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA, and in particular during the PBG Joint Expert Group \nmeeting held on 1June 2011 in Beihai, the PRC, and the sixth PBG forum held on 18\u201319 \nAugust 2011 in Nanning, the PRC. Broad agreement was reached on key aspects of the TA, \nand strong support was obtained for its design and implementation. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4\nII. ISSUES\n2. ADB's Strategy 20205 highlights regional cooperation and integration (RCI) as one of the \nfive core operational areas. In line with this strategy, ADB will increase its support for RCI-\nrelated operations to at least 30% of ADB's total activities by 2020. Both the ASEAN countries \nand the PRC are active participants in various RCI initiatives, including the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program and many initiatives under the \u201cASEAN+X\u201d \nframework.  The  global  financial  crisis  has  affected  the  countries  in  this  region  to  varying \ndegrees, and there is a need for them to strengthen regional cooperation for a more integrated \nregional economy.\n3.  PBG economic cooperation has been seen as one of the two major pillars of ASEAN\u2013\nPRC cooperation, the other pillar being the ADB-coordinated GMS Program. While the GMS \nProgram supports cooperation mainly in the continental part of the ASEAN\u2013PRC region, the \nPBG  initiative  is  intended  to  focus  on  cooperation  between  the  PRC\u2019s  southern  coastal \nprovinces (including Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangdong Province, and Hainan \nProvince) and the oceanic part of ASEAN. Thanks to the mutual efforts of the participating \ncountries, PBG economic cooperation has gained stronger momentum and emerged as a new \nand important economic partnership under the framework of ASEAN\u2013PRC cooperation. \n4. ASEAN and  the  PRC signed  a  framework  agreement  on  comprehensive  economic \ncooperation in November 2002, with the key objective to deepen economic links and increase \n                                               \n1Begun in 2006, the PBG economic cooperation initially focused on promoting cooperation in the Pan-Beibu Gulf, \nwhich geographically covers the subregion of the southern coastal provinces of the People's Republic of China \n(PRC), Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Viet Nam. The first forum on PBG \neconomic cooperation was cosponsored by the Government of the PRC and ADB in 2006. Over the years, the PBG \ninitiative has expanded to include all the 10 member states of ASEANand the PRC. \n2ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Capacity Development for Regional Cooperation in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and Mongolia. Manila. The project helped establish the PBG Joint Expert Group and supported its work in its \ninitial stage. \n3The PBG Joint Expert Group comprises members from all the countries participating in PBG cooperation, including \nsenior officials from the ministries of trade and/or economy as well as scholars with special expertise in regional \ncooperation. It was established in July 2008 with a mandate to conduct a feasibility study on PBG economic \ncooperation. \n4The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 September2011.\n5ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila.", "2\nintraregional trade and investment by establishing the China\u2013ASEAN Free Trade Area, often \nreferred to as CAFTA. This paved the way for the conclusion of the Trade in Goods Agreement\nin  November  2004, Trade  in  Services  Agreement in  January  2007, and  the Investment\nAgreement in August 2009. CAFTA was formally put into implementation on 1 January 2010. \nThis has given rise to one of the largest free trade areas in the world, comprising 11 countries \nwith 1.9 billion consumers and a combined gross domestic product of more than $6 trillion. \nCAFTA is certain to result in positive net trade creation for its member countries. The trade \nbetween ASEAN and the PRC reached $293 billion in 2010, an increase of 37.5% over 2009. In \nthe first half of 2011, ASEAN\u2013PRC trade grew by 25.4% to $171 billion. The PRC is now \nASEAN\u2019s largest trading partner, while ASEAN has become the PRC\u2019s third-largest trading \npartner. \n5. To fully tap the vast potential of cooperation, several challenges need to be overcome. \nFirst, although ASEAN as a whole has a trade surplus with the PRC, which stood at $16.4 billion \nin 2010, some individual ASEAN countries like Viet Nam and Indonesia have a rising trade \ndeficit with the PRC. Since most of the ASEAN countries hold limited foreign exchange reserves, \nthe expanding trade deficit has become a barrier to further trade expansion. Second, while \nASEAN and the PRC are economically complementary, by and large, there exists competition in \nsome sectors, particularly in labor-intensive industries. In the aftermath of the global financial \ncrisis,  such  competition  is likely to  intensify due to  the rising  protectionism,  particularly  in \ndeveloped countries. Third, the per capita income is still relatively low in most countries in the \nregion, and the ASEAN consumer market, though expanding rapidly, is still small. Fourth, some \nASEAN countries are concerned that the rapid expansion of the PRC\u2019s economic power could \nlead to loss of their competitiveness and market shares in certain sectors. Promoting closer \ncooperation between the PBG countries will help overcomethese challenges. \n6. Progress has been achieved in PBG economic cooperation, particularly in terms of \nstronger  commitment  from  participating countries  and  clearer  direction  for  the  future.  One \nnotable achievement was the establishment of the PBG Joint Expert Group and the completion \nof a Feasibility Report on PBG Economic Cooperation, which was endorsed by the ASEAN\u2013\nPRC Economic Ministers\u2019 Meeting on 12 August 2011 and welcomed by the leaders of the \nASEAN countries and the PRC at the 14th ASEAN\u2013China Summit held on 18 November 2011 in \nBali, Indonesia.\n7. The report concludes that PBG cooperation is highly desirable and will help form a new \ngrowth pole in Asia and the Pacific by promoting intraregional trade, boosting competitiveness of \nthe region as a whole, and cushioning the shocks from global crises. It spells out key principles \nfor cooperation: (i) development based on equality and mutual benefit; (ii) results orientation; \n(iii) openness  and  transparency;  (iv) market  rules;  (v)  respect  for  territorial  integrity  of \nparticipating  countries;  and  (vi) respect for  international  laws,  particularly  those  on  marine \nenvironment  protection.  It  also  sets priority  areas  for  action: (i)  expanding  infrastructure\nconnectivity beyond the GMS to link the rest of ASEAN with the PRC; (ii) developing ports and \nmaritime transport services; (iii) facilitating cross-border trade and investment with a focus on \ndeveloping trade and economic cooperation zones; (iv) strengthening agriculture cooperation,\nespecially with a  view  to  solving food  security and food  safety issues;  and (v)  promoting \nindustrial cooperation and developing regional value chains. The report further indicates the \nneed to design and establish proper cooperation mechanisms such as working groups, senior \nofficials\u2019 consultations, ministerial meetings, and a secretariat.\n8. To achieve greater success, the PBG initiative will need to further delineate its direction \nand  priorities,  particularly  at  the  sector  level,  formulate  action  plans,  mobilize  substantial ", "3\nfinancial and human resources, and design an effective institutional mechanism. It also needs to \ncoordinate with other ongoing subregional cooperation involving ASEAN countries, particularly \nthe GMS Program, Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East ASEAN Growth \nArea,  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand  Growth  Triangle,  and  various  \u201cASEAN+X\u201d platforms. \nSpecial attention should be paid to minimizing duplication of efforts and maximizing synergies \nwith those RCI programs in the region. \nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n9. The impact of the TA will be stronger regional economic cooperation between the PBG \ncountriesdeveloped, contributing to an increase of ASEAN\u2013PRC trade. \n10. The TA's outcome will be a well-defined direction, set of priorities, and institutional \nframework for PBG economic cooperation, contributing to full implementation of CAFTA. The TA \nwill formulate a road map for PBG economic cooperation that will help the PBG initiative define \nand position itself appropriately in the current architecture of regional cooperation in East and \nSoutheast Asia. Efforts will be made to ensure that the road map will be consistent with and \ntake into account other actions already agreed and/or being implemented in the PBG member \ncountries, including the new GMS Strategic Framework 2012\u20132022 and the Implementation \nBlueprints  2012\u20132016  for  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN \nGrowth Area and Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle, which are being prepared with \nADB assistance. The TA will also help design an institutional framework for PBG economic \ncooperation as called for by the PBG countries in the Feasibility Report on PBG Economic \nCooperation. Achieving the intended outcome will help PBG countries tackle the challenges \nthey face in fully realizing the vast potential forcooperation in the subregion.\n11. The impact and outcome will be achieved through the delivery of the following outputs:\n(i) a road map for PBG economic cooperation that will define priority actions for \ncooperation in  selected  key  sectors,  list  the  potential  pilot  projects  of  PBG \neconomic cooperation, and include a work program for the next 5years;\n(ii) recommendations on a PBG institutional framework, including policy dialogue \nand decision-making mechanisms, sector-specific committees, technical working \ngroups, and a secretariat, with respective terms of references; \n(iii) greater capacity of PBG countries for deepening regional economic cooperation; \nand \n(iv) policy briefs and/or best practice notes for high-level decision makers based on \nthe above outputs.\nB. Methodology and Key Activities\n12.  The TA will undertake the following activities:\n(i) organizing  studies,  consultations, and workshops to  help  the  PBG  countries \nformulate a road map to operationalize the feasibility report on PBG Economic \nCooperation; \n(ii) organizing  studies to  help design an  overall institutional framework for  PBG \ncooperation\u2014this  includes taking  stock  of  the  experience  and  practices  of \nvarious  RCI  programs  with  regard  to  institutional  structure,  analyzing the \ncommon successful factors, and recommending modalities and measures for \nconsideration by the PBG countries; ", "4\n(iii) organizing the meetings of the PBG Joint Expert Group, which will serve as the \nsenior officials\u2019 forum before a formal institutional framework is set up; \n(iv) organizing  capacity  building  activities  to  support  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of the PBG road map, including training workshops and study \ntours on key subjects such as trade and economic zone development;\n(v) organizing  public\u2013private  dialogues  and  business  forums  to  address  private \nsector  needs,  increase  awareness  about  public\u2013private  partnerships,  and \ndevelop such partnershipopportunities in selected key sectors; and \n(vi) organizing workshops for knowledge sharing among PBG countries and with the \nrest of Asia. \nC. Cost and Financing\n13.  ADB will provide $900,000 of which, (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB; and (ii) $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).
