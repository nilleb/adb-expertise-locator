INTRODUCTION  \n1.  Mainstreaming managing for development results (MfDR) was one of the five broad \noutcomes of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) reform agenda, adopted on 25 August 2004, \nto enhance ADB's development effectiveness. MfDR is also one of the key principles of the \nParis  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness,  which  was  endorsed  by  the  global  development \ncommunity and representatives from over 100 countries on 3 March 2005. Based on its long-\nterm strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),1 ADB is committed to meeting all major \nrequirements under the Paris Declaration by 2012. Given the results-based nature of MfDR, \nADB's adoption of MfDR is expected to help it make aid more effective. \n \n2.  Since  adopting  MfDR,  ADB  has  been  promoting  results-based  management  in  its \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). The Strategy and Policy Department developed an MfDR \naction plan (revised in August 2006) aimed at improving (i) DMC capacity for MfDR, (ii) ADB's \ninstitutional effectiveness, and (iii) global partnerships. The first pillar focuses on integrating \nMfDR  capacity  development  with  regional  department  (RD)  operations,  particularly  through \ncountry partnership strategies, and on strengthening DMC monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \ncapacities. Strong country-led M&E systems are needed for DMCs to monitor progress and \nassess results of development efforts toward achieving their Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) and to integrate lessons of self-evaluation into their planning and budgeting.  \n \n3.  The Independent Evaluation Department (IED) has been providing evaluation capacity \ndevelopment (ECD), through an ongoing regional technical assistance (TA),2 to strengthen M&E \ncapacities\u2014both monitoring and self-evaluation\u2014in some DMCs under the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Program. The TA is supported by the People's Republic of China (PRC) \nRegional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund. The fund also intends to cover ECD for \nDMCs under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program3 through this \nproposed regional TA, which was approved for inclusion in the fund by the regional cooperation \ncommunity of practice (CoP) on 18 November 2008 and by the PRC Ministry of Finance on 17 \nDecember 2008.4 The TA's design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  In some DMCs where M&E systems are well developed (e.g., Malaysia), the systems are \nconsidered a driver of success for the countries' socioeconomic progress. Unfortunately, good \nM&E systems are not prevalent in many DMCs due to lack of demand (e.g., lack of awareness, \ngood governance, and/or political will) and/or supply (e.g., lack of sufficient M&E capacities in \nvarious government agencies). In line with commitments to the Paris Declaration and MDGs, the \ndonor community has stepped up efforts to enhance DMC government awareness that good \nM&E systems are an essential element of MfDR to achieve development results. Although many \nDMCs have become aware of the importance of results-based M&E systems in the development \nprocess, transparency and political will are still lacking. Furthermore, many DMCs still need to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila (TA 6410-REG). \nAvailable: http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/technical-assistance/ongoing-ta/prc-monitoring-evaluation.asp \n3  Initiated in 1997, the CAREC Program has been successful in advancing ADB's cooperation and integration work in \nthe region. CAREC DMCs include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, People's Republic of China (focusing on Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 24 August 2009. \n ", "2 \nprogress their M&E systems by improving the M&E capacities of relevant government officials in \nkey ministries responsible for planning, budgeting, and M&E activities. \n \n5.  ADB and other donors have been assisting DMCs in improving both the demand and \nsupply sides of their M&E capacities and systems as part of MfDR efforts. Demand for ADB's TA \noperations for this purpose has been increasing. In February 2007, the Strategy and Policy \nDepartment established an internet-based CoP on MfDR (http://cop-mfdr.adb.org) as a platform \nfor DMC public officials, organizations, and practitioners to share M&E knowledge and lessons \nin a timely, practical, and sustainable manner. This CoP has around 80 core members from 14 \ncountries. In addition, the Central Operations Services Office has been providing training5 on \nproject design and monitoring frameworks for better project performance management systems. \nSimilarly, much of the training provided by RDs has also focused on the monitoring side of \nproject M&E capacities related to data collection, statistical analysis, poverty assessment, and \nfiduciary arrangements.  \n \n6.  The Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) has been providing training through \nmany TA operations for its DMCs\u2014especially those under the CAREC Program\u2014to improve \ntheir M&E capacities for MfDR (e.g., in project monitoring related to data collection, statistical \nanalysis,  poverty  and  governance  assessment,  in  accordance  with  the  CAREC  strategy).6 \nCWRD is shifting the focus of its M&E training to the evaluation side, including impact evaluation. \n \n7.  The changing development context of the Asia and Pacific region, together with the \nadvent  of  learning  organizations  and  knowledge-based  economies,  has  fed  stocktaking \nexercises7 in IED, which suggest emphasizing ECD8 as one of IED's strategies. Underpinned by \nStrategy 2020, which stresses good governance and capacity development as drivers of change \nto stimulate growth and broader development assistance, ECD can help sharpen MfDR at the \norganizational level in ADB and its DMCs. In this regard, IED has started to provide ECD within \nthe context of development evaluation,9 through a regional TA (footnote 2), to help improve M&E \ncapacities\u2014not only monitoring, but also self-evaluation, including impact evaluation\u2014in some \nGMS DMCs. The proposed regional TA for some CAREC DMCs aims to do the same as that for \nGMS DMCs, by helping strengthen national M&E systems, including self-evaluation capacities, \nof selected CAREC DMCs in line with their MfDR agenda. This will complement earlier results-\nbased M&E training assistance provided by other departments and facilitate the MfDR mandate \nof ADB.  \n \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

Kennedy, \n2009. Supporting Partner Country Ownership and Capacity Development in Evaluation.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of this regional TA will be institutionalized results-based M&E systems to \nsupport  MfDR  in  selected  CAREC  DMCs.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  capacity  and \nawareness  in  results-based  M&E,  including  self-evaluation,  of  relevant  officials  from  key \nministries responsible for planning, budgeting, and M&E in selected CAREC DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA covers 3 years and four CAREC DMCs (i.e., Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan).10 However, in years 1 and 2, if any of these DMCs does not \ndemonstrate sufficient demand for participating in the TA, it can be replaced by another CAREC \nDMC in subsequent year(s). The TA has seven outputs.  \n \n10.  Output 1: ECD Provided by the Shanghai International Program for Development \nEvaluation Training (SHIPDET).11 This is the major output of the TA, which will be delivered to \nabout 20 TA participants selected from the four CAREC DMCs12 (about five participants per \nDMC per year) in October each year for 3 years\u20142009, 2010, and 2011.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Analyses of Surveys on Client Satisfaction with SHIPDET and Intended \nUse of the Knowledge Gained. A questionnaire will be prepared, translated into Russian, and \ndistributed to the TA participants at the end of SHIPDET every year for 3 years to gauge their \nsatisfaction with SHIPDET and how they intend to use the knowledge gained to improve their \nDMCs\u2019 M&E systems. An analysis of the surveys will then be prepared every year for 3 years to \nbe (i) sent to SHIPDET organizers for course improvements, and (ii) used as input for the TA \nmidterm and completion reports. \n \n12.  Output 3: Regional Conference as an Add-On to SHIPDET. To maximize the learning \nexperiences of all participants at SHIPDET and to enhance partnerships between IED and other \nevaluation  organizations,  IED  will  organize  a  1-day  regional  conference  on  development \nevaluation in year 1 of the TA (and organize more in different topics in years 2 and 3, depending \non demand), in collaboration with the Asia-Pacific Finance and Development Center (AFDC).13  \n \n13.  Output 4: Publications of Various Learning Materials. To widely disseminate the \nknowledge shared at the conference and SHIPDET, IED will publish (i) conference papers, and \n                                                 \n10The criteria for selecting these CAREC DMCs are (i) since CWRD anticipates providing impact evaluation training to \nrelevant  officials  in  Kazakhstan  and  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  Shanghai  International  Program  for  Development \nEvaluation Training (SHIPDET) is a good background for the subsequent impact evaluation training; (ii) since \nTajikistan has a relatively developed environment for M&E, this implies that the Government has sufficient demand \nfor strengthening M&E; and (iii) since ADB, under its 2007 harmonization action plan, seeks to strengthen \nUzbekistan\u2019s M&E capacities for poverty reduction, the SHIPDET course complements ADB's commitment.  \n11 SHIPDET, started in early 2007, is cofinanced by ADB, Asia-Pacific Finance and Development Center (AFDC), \nPRC's Ministry of Finance, and World Bank. It is committed to promoting ECD for MfDR for developing countries in \nAsia and the Pacific, by providing M&E-related training courses and network building. Two SHIPDET courses are \nheld annually in Shanghai: the spring course (around April) targets PRC government officials, while the fall course \n(around October) targets other developing country government officials and evaluation practitioners in the region. It \nalso serves as a platform for knowledge sharing, networking, and support for MfDR practitioners. \n12 As described in footnote 11, SHIPDET is not restricted to participants from the four CAREC DMCs, but is also \nopened to relevant government officials from other developing countries and to evaluation practitioners.  \n13 AFDC, a regional knowledge platform, was established in Shanghai in 2004 under the Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation Program to promote regional cooperation and sustainable development. It hosts SHIPDET. \n ", "4 \n(ii) translated Russian versions of the summary of conference papers and summary of SHIPDET \ncourse materials for distribution to a wide audience. These will subsequently be available on the \nIED and other related websites.14 These activities will be done in year 1 of the TA (and done \nagain in years 2 and 3 if regional conferences will be organized then). \n \n14.  Output 5: Follow-On ECD. An international consultant, engaged for about 10 days, will \nprovide a 2\u20133-day follow-on M&E training course (with 2-day course preparation) after year 3 of \nSHIPDET to some former participants reselected by the four CAREC DMCs (up to five per DMC, \ntotaling up to 20 for the four DMCs combined), with a venue to be selected in one of these \nDMCs, to take place around mid-2012, which is about 8 months after year 3 of SHIPDET. The \ncourse will focus on (i) how to compose self-evaluation completion reports (including how to do \nreal-time and impact evaluations) using sample case studies; and (ii) discussions with the TA \nparticipants on the state of their DMCs\u2019 M&E systems and capacities as well as actual use of the \nknowledge gained from SHIPDET to improve their M&E systems, including how the findings and \nlessons from self-evaluation are incorporated into the planning and budgeting preparation. \n  \n15.  Output 6: Analysis of Knowledge Use and State of M&E Systems and Capacities. \nContinued from activity (ii) of output 5, the consultant will spend the remaining 5\u20136 days (i) \nholding focus group discussions with other relevant key government officials (who were not \nformer TA participants) in the DMC where follow-on training will take place (which will be used \nas a sample detailed country case)15 for fact finding and observation of the M&E system, \ncapacity, and extent of improvement; (ii) based on information from various TA outputs and \nactivities, preparing a brief analysis of the state of M&E system and capacity and the extent of \nactual use of the knowledge gained from SHIPDET to improve the M&E system for each of the \nfour  CAREC  DMCs; 16  and  (iii)  drawing  appropriate  recommendations  for  further  M&E \nimprovement for each of these DMCs, which will be used as input for the TA completion report. \n \n16.  Output 7: M&E Knowledge-Sharing Networks Used and/or Partnerships Initiated. \nSHIPDET will not only provide M&E-related training, but will also introduce the TA participants to \n(i)  M&E  knowledge-sharing  networks  (e.g.,  M&E  CoP  and  MfDR  CoP)  in  which  they  can \nparticipate to sustain knowledge gained, and (ii) various evaluation agencies and associations \nwith which they can subsequently plan or initiate partnerships.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund, and administered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years (from September 2009 to August 2012). The \nExecuting Agency is ADB, with IED as the focal point, supported by other stakeholders (i.e., \n                                                 \n14 The M&E CoP collaboration platform (www.linkingtoresults.org), housed within the MfDR CoP website (http://cop-\nmfdr.adb.org), aims to boost knowledge sharing and learning for M&E in the Asia and Pacific region. The platform \nwas developed under an ongoing TA (footnote 2). Its initial members are ministry officials from Cambodia, Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam.  \n15 If enough funds remain in the TA during the follow-on training, the consultant should also be sent to the remaining \nthree CAREC DMCs (for about 2 days per DMC) to conduct fact finding and observations. \n16 However, for the sample detailed country case where the follow-on training will be held, the information will be more \nsolid and in-depth since the consultant will be able to conduct fact finding through focus group discussions with \nother relevant government officials who were not former TA participants, and to make his or her own observations. \n ", "5 \nCWRD, resident missions [RMs] of the four selected CAREC DMCs, and AFDC), who will help \nIED implement the TA as per the schedule in Appendix 3. IED will request that CWRD ask each \nof the four RMs to contact its usual government focal point to select about five officials per DMC \nper year (totaling about 20 officials per year from the four DMCs combined) as TA participants to \nattend SHIPDET in years 1\u20133 of the TA. The SHIPDET schedule for 2009 is 10\u201320 October. \nThe officials to be selected should be different people each year, and they should come from \nkey ministries responsible for planning, budgeting, and M&E activities.  \n \n19.  Of the five officials to be selected per DMC per year, at least two should be high-level \npolicy makers17 to try to increase awareness in terms of policy making, and the remaining \nofficials should be mid-level officials to try to implement policies effectively. The four RMs will \nprovide logistical support to the TA participants in their respective DMCs (e.g., processing visas, \nbuying  round-trip  economy-class  tickets,  and  providing  advance  per  diem  for  the  stay  in \nShanghai). The budget for these purposes will be transmitted by the Controller's Office to the \nfour RMs once advance requests based on estimated expenditures for the activities for up to 6 \nmonths are received. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). The TA \nhas no procurement of equipment. \n \n20.  As mentioned in paras. 14 and 15, an international consultant will be hired after year 3 of \nSHIPDET participation for about 10 continuous days (in mid-2012) to (i) prepare and provide  \n2\u20133-day follow-on ECD in one of the four DMCs chosen as the venue; (ii) prepare a brief \nanalysis of the state of M&E systems and capacities in the four DMCs, together with the extent \nof actual use of the knowledge gained from SHIPDET to improve the DMCs' M&E systems; and \n(iii) prepare a TA completion report. The consultant terms of reference is in Appendix 4. A \nnational consultant, based in Manila for about 5 weeks intermittently over the 3-year course of \nthe TA (1 week in year 1, and 2 weeks each in years 2 and 3), will be hired to (i) provide \nlogistical support at various stages; (ii) prepare analyses of the client satisfaction surveys and \nintended use of the SHIPDET course in years 1\u20133 of the TA, and a TA midterm report in year 2; \nand (iii) finalize a TA completion report prepared by the international consultant in year 3. The \nconsultant terms of reference is in Appendix 4.  \n \n21.  Given the short-term nature of the international consultant and the intermittent nature of \nthe national consultant, both will be engaged as individual consultants by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Capacity Development in Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation for Countries under \nthe Asian Development Bank's Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n17 Since high-level policy makers are generally not available to attend a long training course like SHIPDET, AFDC and \nIED have recently explored an opportunity for organizing a shorter course, for about 2\u20133 days, as an add-on to \nSHIPDET, to increase awareness of high-level policy makers of the importance of results-based M&E systems and \nthe need to institutionalize them in DMCs' planning and budgeting preparations. If such an opportunity materializes, \nthen the five TA participants from each of the four DMCs in years 2 and 3 of the TA will be divided into two groups: \n(i) 2\u20133 high-level policy makers will be attending the proposed shorter training course, and (ii) the remaining 2\u20133 \nmid-level officials will be attending the regular SHIPDET course. The budget saved may be used to hire a resource \nspeaker to deliver the proposed shorter training course. The TA cost estimates will then be adjusted accordingly. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nSummary
