The Government of India (the Government) has requested advisory technical assistance \n(TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  mainstream  public\u2013private  partnerships \n(PPPs)  in  central  line  ministries.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  India  2\u20135  July  2007  to \nascertain the context, scope, and direction of the proposed TA, as well as to consult on the \nspecifications, and TA measures and costs related to its components. The Government has \nconcurred  with  the  project  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  costs, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Background. India achieved an impressive 9% gross domestic product (GDP) annual \ngrowth rate during 2006\u20132007. Over the past 5 years (2002-2006), the GDP growth rate has \naveraged 7.2%. However, the economy is increasingly running into infrastructure constraints. \nThe midterm appraisal of the Tenth Five Year Plan of the Planning Commission showed that \ninadequate  infrastructure  in  urban  and  rural  areas  is  a  major  factor  constraining  India\u2019s \neconomic growth. Weak infrastructure is costing India about 3\u20134 percentage points of GDP \ngrowth  a  year.2 In  the  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012),  the  Planning  Commission \nestimates that India needs to increase its spending on infrastructure from 4.6% to 8.0% of GDP \nto accelerate average GDP growth from 7% to the targeted 9% over the next 5 years. ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy for India concurs with this assessment.  \n \n3.  Infrastructure,  as  a  public  good,  is  a  critical  determinant  of  productivity,  inclusive \ndevelopment,  national  integration,  and  poverty  reduction.  Insufficient  capacity  across \ninfrastructure sectors leads to a widening infrastructure gap, resulting in lower productivity, \nhigher  transport  and  logistics  costs,  reduced  competitiveness,  and  slower  growth.  Public \nfinancing\u2014already constrained by the deficit reduction provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility \nand Budget Management Act 20043\u2014will not be able to generate alone the needed levels of \ninvestments to improve infrastructure facilities. According to the Eleventh Five Year Plan, the \ntargeted average GDP growth rate of 9% during 2007-2012 requires an increase in private \ninvestment from the historical average of 6.5% per year to nearly 12.0% per year. This would \nraise private investment from 21.1% of GDP in the Tenth Five Year Plan to 24.9% in the \nEleventh Five Year Plan. Thus, the private sector needs to be encouraged to participate in \ninfrastructure improvements. Furthermore, only a closer partnership between the public and \nprivate sectors can support sustainable development, reduce poverty, promote equity, and \nachieve greater prosperity. \n \n4.  Government Strategy and Recent Initiatives. The Government is fully aware of the \nsynergies  that  a  partnership  with  India\u2019s  strong  and  vibrant  private  sector  can  bring  to \ninfrastructure. The Government\u2019s strategy for addressing the infrastructure deficit includes (i) \nmainstreaming PPP arrangements as the preferred mode for infrastructure development, (ii) \nenhancing  private  sector  participation  through  policy  and  regulatory  framework,  and  (iii) \nenabling arrangements for bridging financing gaps. The strategy essentially utilizes budgetary \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 25 September 2007. \n2  World Bank. 2006. India: Building Capacities for Public Private Partnerships. Washington, DC.  \n3  The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act requires the Government to reduce its fiscal deficit by a \nminimum of 0.3% of GDP every year and its revenue deficit by 0.5% each year, so that the fiscal deficit is not more \nthan 3% of GDP by the end of March 2009. \n ", "2   \nresources to maximize efficiency and leverage the large pool of private capital, as well as \nintroduce private sector-based technological efficiencies and management enhancement.  \n \n5.  The Government recognizes it has an important and expanded role in the changing \neconomic and technological context for catalyzing private investment flows in infrastructure \nthrough (i) developing legal and regulatory frameworks and arrangements, (ii) planning and \ncoordinating, (iii) operating public infrastructure efficiently, (iv) enhancing access and benefits \nfor the poor, (v) mainstreaming good governance, (vi) reforming institutions, and (vii) ensuring \nquality of infrastructure. In all these areas, the challenge for the Government is in pursuing \nreforms that assure investors of predictability, equal opportunities, low transaction costs, and \nrates of return commensurate with the levels of risk.    \n \n6.  Catalyzing infrastructure investments requires sustained actions over a broad range of \nfactors. Some recent steps taken by the Government to encourage PPPs include  \n(i)  establishing a PPP cell in the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) in the Ministry \nof  Finance;  the  Government  is  also  guiding  state  governments  and  central  line \nministries in establishing cells for mainstreaming PPPs;  \n(ii)  setting up the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) to facilitate \naccess to long-term resources for infrastructure development;4  \n(iii)  creating  a  fund,  the  Viability  Gap  Fund  (VGF)  scheme,  with  a  current  annual \nallocation of about $340 million to promote PPPs;5  \n(iv)  forming an interministerial group to determine the prequalification of bidders under \nPPP to avoid fly-by-night operators; and  \n(v)  preparing  PPP  tool  kits  and  model  concession  agreements  by  DEA  for  use  by \nvarious state governments and central line ministries. \n \n7.  Despite these recent steps, India is still at the first stage of PPP development6 in most \nsectors.  This  stage  involves,  among  other  activities,  designing  a  policy  and  legislative \nframework  that  enables  successful  partnerships,  getting  the  deals  right,  and  building  the \nmarketplace. Central line ministries have not recognized fully the potential for infrastructure \ndevelopment through PPPs, especially for building a viable PPP framework and pipeline of \nprojects. The enabling legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks at most central ministries remain \nunderdeveloped or weakly applied.  \n \n8.  The Government realizes that capacity, awareness, and attitudinal shifts of the central \nministries are prerequisites for mainstreaming PPPs. The level of capacity and operational \nefficiency  across  the  central  line  ministries  undermines  the  effectiveness  of  infrastructure \nfacilities, which in turn impedes the ability to attract private sector interest in developing and \nfinancing PPP infrastructure projects. The central ministries also lack a real-time database for \neffective monitoring of ongoing PPP projects.  \n \n9.  In view of this situation, as well as ADB\u2019s substantial involvement in infrastructure, the \nGovernment  requested  ADB  assistance  in  2006  to  build  the  capacity  of  states  for \n                                                 \n4  IIFCL has paid-up capital of about $2.27 million and authorized capital of about $227 million. Apart from its equity, \nIIFCL will be funded through long-term debt, for which the Government may extend a guarantee for repayment of \nprincipal and interest. The extent of guarantee provided in the first year of operations is expected to be around $2.2 \nbillion. \n5  The Viability Gap Fund can provide catalytic grant assistance of up to 20% of the capital costs, through which it \nexpects several projects to become bankable, attract private capital, and mobilize private sector efficiencies.  \n6  Three infrastructure sectors in India (roads, ports, and airports) are at a more advanced level of PPP development \ncompared with other infrastructure sectors in India. ", "  3\nmainstreaming PPPs and to strengthen the nodal PPP cell at DEA.7 The Government requested \nsimilar  support8 for  central  line  ministries  that  have  been  unable  to  incorporate  PPPs \nsignificantly into their approach, especially when compared with power and telecommunications. \nThe proposed TA complements the ongoing TA since the PPP cell within DEA will play a crucial \ncoordinating role to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of PPP schemes across \nthe selected central line ministries.  \n \n10.  Unlike  the  ongoing  TA,  which  was  designed  to  develop  cross-sector  capacity  for \npromoting PPPs at nodal agencies of states, the proposed TA will develop sector-specific \ncapacity of central line ministries to promote PPP initiatives for the sectors they are overseeing. \nPPP cells at selected ministries would provide sector-specific advice and guidance, among \nother activities, to state PPP cells and state line departments. Lessons learned from PPPs \nemphasize the need for sector-specific interventions. \n \n11.  ADB's  assistance  through  this  TA  has  significant  operational  relevance  since  the \nenhanced capacity for identifying and developing PPPs will generate business opportunities for \nADB infrastructure financing. This TA also represents an opportunity for ADB to address a \nwidely felt need to focus on central line ministries that could contribute directly to growth and \nimprovement in poverty indicators, such as health and education, as well as on ministries where \nthe predominance of the state impinges on creating equal opportunities.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The proposed TA will support the Government in mainstreaming PPPs in the central line \nministries  by  building  capacity  and  institutionalizing  PPP  best  practices  to  improve  skills \nexpeditiously. The impact of the TA will be improved access to basic infrastructure services and \nincreased efficiency in providing such services.  \n \n13.  The outcomes of the TA will include (i) enhanced capacity of PPP cells in selected \ncentral line ministries to prepare, evaluate, and appraise PPPs in infrastructure; (ii) significantly \nimproved monitoring of progress in PPPs in infrastructure in central line ministries through well-\nknit databases; (iii) increased awareness among potential private sector partners about the \nproject cycle of PPP projects in infrastructure, and Government expectations regarding value for \nmoney;  and  (iv)  increased  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development  and \nmanagement throughout India over the long term.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  Support under this project will be (i) part of the larger Government agenda on economic \nreforms and institutional development by focusing on a key sector (i.e., infrastructure); (ii) needs \ndriven (the TA has been formulated based on needs specified by central line ministries); (iii) \ntargeted and add value by focusing on relevant capacity building and creating an enabling \nframework for PPPs in selected central line ministries; and (iv) focused on selected central line \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2006. Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships at State Level. (TA 4890, Japan Special Fund, $1.8 million; \nTechnical Assistance Support Fund, $1.2 million, approved 20 November). \n8  The request for ADB assistance for central line ministries was indicated initially in June 2007 and reiterated during \nthe country partnership strategy discussions in July 2007. The Conference of Chief Secretaries, held on 21 July \n2007, also highlighted the importance of leadership by central line ministries in introducing PPPs in major \ninfrastructure sectors, including health and education. \n ", "4   \nministries where the scope for using PPPs will have significant impact on the development of \nessential infrastructure. \n \n15.  The TA will have two components: capacity building and institutionalization of PPP skills. \nThe first component, capacity building for PPP cells in selected central line ministries, includes \n(i) developing regulatory and policy frameworks in selected subsectors in consultation with line \nministries;  (ii)  providing  specific  advice  and  guidance  to  PPP  cells  in  line  ministries;  (iii) \nsupporting project preparation, appraisal, and evaluation; and (iv) disseminating knowledge and \nbuilding awareness of international best practices.9 This support will proceed in tandem with a \nreview of the infrastructure development constraints in the existing frameworks; review and \nfinalization  of  eligibility  criteria;  and  development  of  necessary  policy,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional reforms in the infrastructure sector. \n \n16.  Based on the capacity building support, the second component will help PPP cells in \nselected central line ministries to institutionalize their skills through practical application of the \nenabling framework and lessons learned. For this, each selected central line ministry will identify \ntwo  potential  PPP  interventions  around  which  the  frameworks  will  be  refined  and  skills \nupgraded. This component includes (i) refining the PPP policy and regulatory framework,10 (ii) \nmeeting compliance and public safety norms, (iii) perfecting bidding documents and procedures, \n(iv) determining how risk is shared between public and private partners, (v) conducting value-\nadded research and analysis, and (vi) determining adequate monitoring arrangements.  \n \n17.  Key activities will include (i) conducting a baseline survey of the regulatory environment \nfor infrastructure at selected central line ministries; (ii) developing the capacity of PPP cells in \nthose  ministries;11 (iii)  assisting  in  promoting  PPPs  in  infrastructure  through  appropriate \noutreach  to  potential  private  sector  partners;  and  (iv)  increasing  awareness  among  these \npartners about their role in PPP, thereby increasing overall understanding of the PPP project \ncycle.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $2.5 million, of which ADB will finance the \nequivalent of $2.0 million on a grant basis from its technical assistance funding program. The \nGovernment will provide the equivalent of $500,000 to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, \nand local transport. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n9  Dissemination also will take the form of road shows that will help showcase the PPP experiences of the selected \nprojects. Workshops or seminars will be conducted, and capacity development support will include undertaking \npartnership development missions to countries that have practiced PPPs successfully in infrastructure. Cross-\nlearning among the central infrastructure line ministries also will be encouraged. \n10 The legal and regulatory changes that are needed to promote PPPs involve (i) concession contracts; (ii) financing, \nsuch as through special purpose vehicles; (iii) competition; and (iv) regulatory risks that could be disincentives to \nprivate sector participation in PPPs in infrastructure.  \n11 The training and capacity building activities include (i) enhancing the understanding of the rationale for PPP \nprojects; (ii) using risk assessment models and developing options for appropriate risk-sharing schemes; (iii) \neffectively using tools for assessing value for money, such as public sector comparators (i.e., what the Government \nwould have to pay if it undertook the project itself); (iv) understanding the structure and regulatory implications of \nconcession contracts; (v) managing a bid process to maximize competition, and addressing issues relating to \ncompetition and regulation in infrastructure; (vi) appraising PPP projects; and (vii) evaluating contingent liabilities \nincurred as part of PPP projects. ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  DEA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee for the TA, to be \nchaired by a joint secretary at DEA, will be established and will have representatives of the PPP \ncells from the participating line ministries, as well as one person from the private sector selected \nby DEA. The steering committee, which will meet at least once every 6 months, is mandated to \nprovide policy oversight, monitor and guide TA implementation, and resolve issues that arise \nduring implementation. \n \n20.  The entities selected for TA support are PPP cells in six central line ministries.12 To \nachieve project outcomes, 468 person-months of national consulting services (Appendix 3) will \nbe provided13 to the selected ministries. In each ministry, the TA will provide (i) one PPP expert \n(on an individual basis) focusing on project financial analysis and risk management, (ii) one \nfinancial  expert  (individual)  focusing  on  financial  modeling,  and  (iii)  one  management \ninformation system expert (individual) focusing on information management.14 The individuals \nand firms will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). A committee of representatives from ADB and the \nGovernment (including DEA and the participating line ministries) will recruit the consultants. \n \n21.  The Government and participating line ministries will provide office space and furniture, \nas well as the logistical and administrative support necessary to implement the project. TA \nimplementation will last 36 months, from November 2007 to November 2010. The advance \npayment  facility,  to  be  administered  and  managed  by  DEA,  may  be  used  to  facilitate  TA \ndisbursement.  The  steering  committee  will  disseminate  the  results  of  the  TA,  and  project \nevaluation results will be made publicly available on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n22.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for Mainstreaming Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships at Central Line Ministries of the Government of India. \n                                                 \n12 The central infrastructure line ministries will be identified in consultation with the Government of India. \n13 The selection method, terms of reference, reporting as well as coordinating arrangements for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. For facilitating the work of PPP cells, the 2006 World Bank report on PPPs in India (refer to footnote 2) \nstates that PPP cells need to \u201crely on some long-term consulting skills\u201d so that consultants can provide the \nnecessary project-related and transactions skills.  \n14 Given the long-term nature of the assignment, a large number of individual consultants are essential since it would \nfacilitate customization of the approach and much needed flexibility. Each ministry requires a tailor-made and \nspecialized focus. A single consulting firm would not be able to bring all the diverse specialized resources that are \nrequired for this assignment.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n                       DESIGN AND MONITORING
