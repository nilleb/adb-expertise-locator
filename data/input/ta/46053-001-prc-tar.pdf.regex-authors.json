INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission in November 2011, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to strengthen the China Energy Label (CEL), a mandatory energy \nlabeling scheme in the PRC, by establishing a reliable and comprehensive evaluation system. \nThe TA was included in the PRC country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014.1 The concept \npaper was approved on 21 June 2012. During a fact-finding mission in August 2012, the impact, \noutcome, outputs, financial plan, and implementation arrangements of the TA were agreed with \nthe General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) and the \nChina National Institute of Standardization (CNIS). The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s sustained economic growth over the past 20 years has brought millions of \npeople  out  of  poverty.  But  this  economic  growth  was  energy-intensive,  and  it  came  at  a \ndisproportionately high cost to the environment and resources. During this period, the PRC \nbecame  the  world\u2019s  largest  energy  consumer.  One  of  the  most  important  development \nchallenges  in  the  PRC  is  to  direct  consumption  and  production  patterns  toward  resource \nconserving and energy-efficient growth patterns. This requires concerted and cooperative efforts \nthroughout the entire cycle of production and consumption of energy. In this effort, the PRC \nachieved an energy intensity reduction of 19.1% in 2010 compared to 2005. But the emphasis \nwas primarily on the supply-side options, and measures to specifically target end-user energy \nefficiency have been lacking.   \n \n3.  The PRC is now one of the world\u2019s largest producers and consumers of energy-using \nproducts. Household energy consumption has increased sharply owing to the rapid growth in \nthe ownership of home appliances.3 In 2010, household electricity consumption was about 12% \nof the total electricity consumption in the PRC.4 In the absence of consumer awareness and \neducation about energy-efficient products, especially how high operational costs offset the initial \ncost advantage of inefficient products, consumers continue to prefer low-cost but high energy-\nconsuming products. As a result, there is insufficient demand for energy-efficient products, \nwhich in turn has deterred producers from innovating and launching highly energy-efficient \nproducts. Unless these highly energy-efficient products are launched and used extensively, it \nwill not be possible to achieve the cost reduction benefits resulting from economies of scale and \ntechnological  improvement.  This  is  a  major  barrier  to  improving  energy  efficiency  at  the \nhousehold level. Highly energy-efficient products offer opportunities for consumers to reduce \ntheir energy bill and conserve energy, which can moderate demand growth, thereby reducing \nemissions.    \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA is included as Energy Efficiency Compliance Evaluations for High-Efficiency Products in ADB. 2012. \nCountry Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 June 2012. \n3  In 1981, the ownership of home appliances was extremely limited. By 2005, nearly 190 million urban households \nhad an average of more than one color television, and nearly all owned a washing machine, refrigerator, and air \nconditioner. Between 1998 and 2005, personal computer ownership rates jumped from near-zero to over 40%. \n4  Total electricity consumption in 2010 was 4.19 trillion kilowatt-hours and households consumed 0.51 trillion \nkilowatt-hours. National Energy Administration of the PRC. 2011. Report on China\u2019s Energy Development for 2011. \nBeijing.  \n ", "2  \n4.  Recognizing the need to address end-user energy efficiency, the government introduced \nsome policy measures. In 1989, the minimum energy performance standards (MEPSs) were \nlaunched to prevent the market entry of high energy-consuming products that did not meet the \nthreshold energy efficiency level. But the MEPSs stimulated neither product innovation nor the \ndemand  for  highly  energy-efficient  products.  Thus,  in  2005,  the  CEL  was  introduced  to \ncomplement the MEPSs.  The CEL helps consumers to identify energy-efficient products easily \nbecause  the  label  placed  on  the  product  informs  the  consumer  of  its  energy  efficiency \nperformance. Since its introduction, the CEL has expanded to cover 25 product groups and over \n260,000 models. CNIS, which is responsible for the technical work of the CEL, estimated that \nCEL saved 15 terawatt-hours of electricity between 2005 and 2010, equivalent to 60 million tons \nof coal equivalent, and the associated emissions were avoided. To realize these benefits in a \ntimely manner, there is an urgent need to strengthen the CEL.  \n \n5.  In 2010, a random product testing of nine popular products with high energy efficiency5 \nwas conducted by CNIS and the CEL Center.6 It found serious discrepancies between the \nnameplate  energy  performance  rating  claimed  by  the  manufacturer  and  the  actual  energy \nefficiencies observed during the product tests. Since the CEL does not mandate independent \nexternal verification of the claimed energy efficiency, the manufacturers tend to overstate it. This \nhas eroded consumers\u2019 confidence about the reliability of product information and undermined \nthe CEL objectives. The accuracy and reliability of energy efficiency testing has been another \nmajor problem with the CEL. The current CEL system does include a set of broad testing \nstandards, testing methods, and procedures. However, it does not provide sufficient product-\nspecific technical instructions, which often leads to conflicting and unreliable test results. Under \nthese circumstances, the CEL faces some challenges to ensure a high level of compliance.   \n \n6.  The TA will support the strengthening of the CEL by addressing the key issues outlined \nabove. An improved CEL is expected to build consumers\u2019 confidence about the nameplate \nenergy efficiency rating of products, thereby strengthening demand for them. The TA will also \nprovide  a  substantial  end-user  energy  efficiency  gain  to  help  the PRC  achieve  its energy \nintensity reduction targets.    \n \n7.  The TA is consistent with the strategic priority of environmentally sustainable growth \nunder ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,7 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for PRC, 2011\u20132015, \nwhich indicates environmentally sustainable growth, including the promotion of energy efficiency, \nas a core pillar.8 The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 of the PRC targets 16% energy \nintensity reduction by 2015, and both production- and consumption-side efforts are needed. This \nTA  will  address  demand-side  energy  efficiency  improvement  in  the  PRC  and  is  a  logical \nextension of ADB\u2019s ongoing and planned interventions on the supply side. It fits well with the \npriorities  of  both  the  PRC  and  ADB  on  improving  energy  efficiency  and  reducing  carbon \nintensity in the PRC.  \n \n                                                 \n5  These appliances include fixed speed air conditioners, variable speed air conditioners, compact fluorescent lamps, \ninduction cookers, refrigerators, gas water heaters, electric water heaters, washing machines, and computer \nmonitors. \n6  The CEL Center was established within CNIS to manage CEL registration and monitor the use of energy labels. \n7  ADB. 2008.

The impact of the TA will be improved end-user energy efficiency in the PRC. The \noutcome will be a strengthened and more reliable CEL.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  This  policy  and  advisory  TA  will  help  strengthen  the  CEL  with  a  viable  and \ncomprehensive evaluation system. The TA has four closely interlinked outputs:  \n \n10.  Output 1: A comprehensive assessment of the current CEL and a comparison with \nother international energy labeling schemes. The current CEL will be thoroughly analyzed to \nidentify system gaps, institutional weaknesses, and barriers that cause low compliance with the \nCEL. A comparison with selected international energy labeling schemes will be undertaken to \nexamine  how  the  lessons  learned  from  better  performing  international  schemes  can  be \nincorporated into the CEL. The results of the analysis will be used to formulate a set of policy \nrecommendations (output 2) for strengthening the CEL system.  \n \n11.  Output 2: A comprehensive technical and regulatory policy brief to strengthen the \nCEL  evaluation  system.  This  output  will  be  a  policy  brief  that  proposes  (i)  a  regulatory \nframework to ensure a high level of CEL compliance, and (ii) product-specific detailed technical \ninstructions for energy efficiency testing of refrigerators, air conditioners, and televisions. These \nthree product groups are in high demand with the highest growth rate, and therefore have high \nenergy conservation potential.  \n \n12.  Output 3: Pilot testing of the proposed technical instructions. The recommended \ntechnical instructions will be field-tested to check that they contain no ambiguities, are easy to \nuse, and are feasible to be deployed across testing laboratories in the PRC. A total of about 90 \ndifferent  models  in  the  selected  product  groups  will  be  pilot-tested  using  these  technical \ninstructions.  This  robust  testing  will  provide  valuable  feedback  and  lessons  to  refine  and \nimprove the technical instructions.   \n \n13.  Output 4: Capacity strengthening in CEL implementation. A comprehensive program \nof capacity development will be formulated to target relevant stakeholders, such as product \ntesting  laboratories,  institutions  for  standardization,  product  manufacturers,  and  relevant \ngovernment authorities. Targeted knowledge events will be organized to bring together all key \nstakeholders in the PRC and some international experts to discuss the TA outputs and key \nbuilding  blocks  of  the  strengthened  CEL  and  its  implementation.  In-depth  training  on  the \nformulation of technical instructions, their pilot testing, and rollout for other product groups will \nalso form a key part of the capacity strengthening component.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies, and other in-kind contributions. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nprovided in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  AQSIQ will be the executing agency and CNIS will be the implementing agency. The TA \nwill be carried out by a consulting firm (one international consultant for 5 person-months, and \nfour national consultants for 18 person-months) with expertise in energy standards, energy \nlabeling schemes, energy efficiency configurations, and product energy efficiency testing for \nhome  appliances.  The  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method (with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20) in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The firm will be required to submit a \nsimplified technical proposal covering all aspects of the terms of reference.  \n \n16.  The experts required to undertake the activities of the TA include (i) energy standards \nand labeling expert (international, 5 person-months); (ii) research consultant (national, 4 person-\nmonths); (iii) three technical instruction specialists (national, 6 person-months for refrigerator \nproduct group, 4 person-months each for air conditioner and television product groups). The \ninternational energy standards and labeling expert will be the team leader and will (i) coordinate \nthe activities of the other consultants, and (ii) work closely with ADB and CNIS to discuss \nprogress. The team leader will have technical expertise in (i) energy standards and labeling \nschemes,  (ii)  policy  analysis  and  design,  (iii)  promotion  and  verification  of  energy-efficient \nproducts,  and  (iv)  product  testing.  The  national  research  consultant  will  have  expertise  in \nresearch and analysis of energy labeling schemes and their evaluation. The other three national \ntechnical  instruction  specialists  will  have  broad  technical  expertise  in  the  relevant  product \ngroups, namely refrigerators, air conditioners, and televisions. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  AQSIQ will provide oversight and guidance on the implementation of the TA. CNIS will \nbe  responsible  for  day-to-day  supervision  of  implementation  and  will  coordinate  with  the \nexecuting agency, consultants, and key stakeholders. TA review and tripartite meetings among \nADB, CNIS, and the consultants will be held during TA implementation to guide the consultants \nand review their reports.  \n \n18.  The pilot testing of selected products (para. 12) will be organized by CNIS under the \nsupervision of AQSIQ. The pilot testing will be performed at selected testing laboratories in the \nPRC. CNIS, in coordination with ADB, will develop the evaluation criteria to select these testing \nlaboratories.  \n \n19.  An international workshop and technical training sessions will be organized by CNIS with \nthe  support  of  ADB,  and  an  advance  payment  facility  will  be  provided,  if  necessary. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 15 months from 15 October 2012, with an \nexpected completion date of 15 January 2014. The consultants will submit an inception report \nwithin 1 month after signing the consulting contract. The interim reports, for each output, will be \nprovided 3 months after commencement of the task, and the draft final reports upon completion \nof each output. The consultants will take into account the comments provided by ADB and the \nimplementing agency on the draft final report for each output, and the consolidated final report \nwill be submitted upon completion of all the outputs. The team leader will be responsible for \ncollating the reports of the individual consultants to ensure consistency and coherence. All \nreports will be provided in English and Chinese.  \n \n ", "5 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.
