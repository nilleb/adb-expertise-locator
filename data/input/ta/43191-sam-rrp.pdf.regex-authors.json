The  program  will  support  an  expanded  public  investment \nprogram that will assist recovery from an economic slowdown linked to \nthe global economic crisis and address reconstruction needs arising from \nthe September 2009 tsunami. The program will simultaneously implement \nstructural and governance measures that will strengthen prospects for \nsustaining  economic  growth  over  the  medium  term.  Additional  policy \nactions will help protect the vulnerable, safeguard Samoa's fiscal position, \nand facilitate communication and engagement with the private sector and \ncivil society. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsectors): Multisector: public sector management; transport, \nand information and communication technology; heath and social \nprotection \nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability, promoting economic efficiency and enabling business \nenvironment, widening access to markets and economic opportunities), \ngovernance (economic and financial governance), private sector \ndevelopment (policy reforms) \nLocation impact: National (high impact) \n   \nEnvironment  Category C. No significant adverse environmental impacts are identified. \nAssessment \n   \nSocial Safeguards  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected. \n   \nRationale and  The global economic crisis contributed to a sharp economic slowdown in \nDescription  Samoa. The economy contracted by 5.5% in fiscal year (FY) 2009 as \nremittances weakened and cutbacks in the Australian automobile industry \nreduced demand for Samoa's manufacturing exports of automotive wire \nharnesses. The completion of major construction projects in FY2008 and \nthe  erosion  of  household  purchasing  power  by  high  inflation  also \ncontributed to the economic deterioration. In FY2009, 2,035 formal sector \njobs were lost\u2014a decline of 9.3%. As many as 1,500 additional jobs held \nby Samoans were lost in September 2009 when a large tuna cannery \nclosed in neighboring American Samoa. \n \nOn  29  September  2009,  a  devastating  earthquake  and  tsunami  hit \nSamoa, killing 143 people and leaving 5 people missing. The tsunami \nreached up to 400 meters inland and damaged or completely destroyed \nvillages,  schools,  roads,  and  tourist  facilities  along  the  southwest, \nsouthern and south eastern coastline. Initial estimates put total damage \nand loss at $106 million, the equivalent of 17% of the  annual gross \n ", "ii   \ndomestic product (GDP). Around $60 million of this would be borne by the \npublic sector. The tsunami directly affected households in areas of the \ncountry that were already relatively poor. \n \nThe recent economic shocks brought to a halt an extended period of \neconomic growth. Assisted by political stability, Samoa implemented far-\nreaching and important reforms that achieved good development results. \nAn early return to moderate rates of economic growth is possible and \nsustainable if there is early completion of tsunami related reconstruction \nand additional support is provided to the private sector. The tourism, \nagriculture, and fishing sectors can be vibrant sources of employment \nand economic growth, building on Samoa\u2019s natural beauty, well-educated \nlabor force, and ample land and marine resources.  \n \nThe government has requested support from development partners to \nhelp the economy recover from the recent shocks. The ERSP is the \ncontribution  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  development \npartners\u2019 collaborative response to this need. The immediate need is to \ncontinue post-tsunami reconstruction initiated by the government with \ndevelopment partner support and assistance by Samoan communities \nliving  abroad.  Grants  of  $26.1  million  from  development  partners, \nincluding ADB, were especially important to funding this initial response. \nIn  December  2009,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  released  $9.3 \nmillion under the Exogenous Shocks Facility and endorsed government \nefforts to secure concessional financing from ADB and the World Bank to \nfurther rebuild the economy. \n \nThe  ERSP  provides  for  elevated  government  capital  expenditure  to \nundertake post-tsunami reconstruction and provide a short-term boost to \neconomic activity (output 1). Complementary policy actions will safeguard \nthe  overall  fiscal  position  and  enhance  the  quality  of  government \nexpenditure  (output  2).  Structural  and  governance  improvements  will \nsupport medium-term prospects for economic growth by enhancing the \neconomy's  productivity  (output  3).  Policy  actions  will  also  provide \nopportunities for the vulnerable to make economic growth more inclusive \n(output 4). Engaging private sector and civil society stakeholders in public \npolicy will be enhanced to deepen local awareness, understanding, and \nownership  of  the  ERSP  (output  5).  The  five  outputs  will  progress \nconcurrently under the two subprograms of the ERSP. \n \nThe ERSP targets economic growth led by the private sector. At the \nmacro  level,  the  ERSP  will  assist  the  private  sector  by  supporting \naggregate demand and lessening the risk that fiscal stress will bring \nmacroeconomic instability. At the micro level, the ERSP will emphasize \nensuring sound public investment, continuing to rationalize state-owned \nenterprises,  improving  the  performance  of  those  that  remain  under \ngovernment ownership, ensuring effective competition in the economy, \nand thorough efforts to modernize the legal framework affecting business. \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the ERSP will be the achievement of higher and more \nOutcome  inclusive economic growth. The outcome of the program will be to initiate ", "  iii\neconomic  recovery  with  extra  protection  for  the  vulnerable  and  the \ncountry\u2019s fiscal position. \n   \nSpecial Features  The policy actions of the ERSP are aligned with the government\u2019s own \npolicy matrix. ADB\u2019s support is harmonized with support to be provided by \nbilateral and multilateral development partners and is in line with advice \nfrom the International Monetary Fund. \n \nSupport for the vulnerable is a feature of the program in recognition of the \nextra hardship imposed by the tsunami, the global economic crisis, and \nthe  preceding  episode  of  high  international  commodity  prices.  This \nsupport will facilitate a progressive reorientation of government programs \nto target the most vulnerable. It is proposed that the ERSP link to a Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction grant for social protection that will support the \npiloting of social safety nets and associated policy development. \n   \nPeriod and  The program cluster period is from 1 March 2009 to 30 December 2011. \nTranching  A single tranche loan of $16.0 million equivalent is to be disbursed under \nsubprogram  1  when  the  government  has  met  the  conditions  for \neffectiveness.  Subprogram  2  will  be  presented  for  consideration  and \napproval  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  depending  on  the  progress \nachieved in implementing subprogram 1, including compliance with the \nproposed  policy  actions,  and  the  readiness  of  the  government  to \nundertake the succeeding policy reforms. A single tranche loan of $10.8 \nmillion  equivalent  is  expected  to  be  disbursed  under  subprogram  2. \nSubprogram  2  is  expected  to  be  considered  by  the  Board  about \n12 months after the subprogram 1 loan takes effect. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The program cluster amounts to $26.8 million equivalent, comprising two \nsubprograms  amounting  to  $16.0 million  equivalent  and  $10.8  million \nequivalent. The loan of $16.0 million equivalent (subprogram 1) will be \nprovided from ADB's Special Funds resources with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, a term of \n24  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the loan agreement. \n   \nProcurement and  Loan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \nDisbursement  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  from  other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to \nthe borrower in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. \n   \nCounterpart  The government shall ensure that the local currency generated from the \nFunds  proceeds of the loan is used to support public expenditure objectives \nunder the program. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for the program. The \nand  Program Coordinating Committee, comprising the Ministry of Finance and \nImplementation  the Central Bank of Samoa, will coordinate the program. The Program \nArrangements  Coordinating Committee will meet at least quarterly to monitor progress \nand oversee the implementation of the program, as well as to guide and \n ", "iv   \ndirect the activities of the executing agency. Development partners will \nalso monitor and review program implementation. \n \nIn  addition  to  engaging  in  broad  policy  dialogue  and  monitoring, \ndevelopment partners have provided and will continue to provide support \nfor specific areas of the policy matrix. ADB support has focused on policy \nregarding  state-owned  enterprises,  the  budget's  medium-term \nexpenditure framework, power sector reform, legislative reform to reduce \nthe cost of doing business, and next steps in social protection. In the \ncontext  of  the  policy  matrix,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, New Zealand Agency for International Development and \nthe United Nations agencies  have been most prominent in the immediate \nresponse to the tsunami and follow-on alleviation of social impacts of the \ntsunami as well as the global economic crisis. The European Union's \nrelevant area of focus is the reform of public financial management, while \nthe  World  Bank  has  provided  support  for  telecommunications  and \ntransport sector reform. \n   \nBenefits  The  program  will  provide  broadly  distributed  benefits  by  helping  to \ncounter the negative impact of the September 2009 tsunami and the \nglobal  economic  crisis  and  setting  a  foundation  for  higher  economic \ngrowth  over  the  medium-to-long  term  led  by  the  private  sector.  The \nvulnerable  will  benefit  from  the  improved  economic  conditions  and \ntargeting of government programs. \n   \nRisks and  The key risks are (i) insufficient government capacity to implement the \nAssumptions  program, (ii) reduced funding for capital expenditure because of a lack of \nrestraint  among  government  agencies  regarding  current  expenditure \ngrowth, (iii) impaired implementation of the medium-term fiscal framework \nbecause of a shortfall in external financing, and (iv) insufficient political \nand community support for policy actions. The program is designed to \nmitigate these risks to the extent feasible. \n \nAchieving  the  expected  impact  from  the  program  relies  on  (i) \nimprovement in the global economy, (ii) a positive response by the private \nsector to improved economic conditions, (iii) continuing improvements in \nthe  performance  orientation  of  government  agencies,  and  (iv)  the \nprovision of complementary technical resources by development partners.", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster for the Economic Recovery Support Program (ERSP) and (ii) a proposed loan \nto the Independent State of Samoa for subprogram 1 of the ERSP. The ERSP was prepared by \na joint team of representatives of the Government of Samoa and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter, \nincluding the policy matrix for subprogram 1 and triggers for subprogram 2, is in Appendix 2. \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  The Impact of the Global Economic Crisis \n \n2.  The Samoan economy grew strongly from fiscal year (FY) 2000 to FY2008, achieving an \naverage growth rate of 4.8% per annum.1 Growth was driven largely by rising construction and \nservice sector activity. Preparations for the 2007 South Pacific Games, expanding tourism \naccommodation, and new public and commercial buildings drove a mini construction boom. \nGrowth  in  remittance  flows  and  tourism  underpinned  expansion  in  commerce,  hotels  and \nrestaurants,  and  transport  and  communications,  while  manufacturing  also  made  a  positive \ncontribution  to  growth.  These  positives  outweighed  a  contraction  in  the  primary  sector \n(Appendix 3). \n \n3.  Some  weakening  in  growth  was  inevitable  in  FY2009  as  the  surge  in  construction \nprojects passed. The global economic crisis, however, added substantially to the severity of the \nslowdown.2 The largest private employer, Yazaki, cut its workforce by more than half as the \nAustralian automobile industry it supplies contracted. Remittances, which supplied 25% of the \ngross domestic product (GDP), slowed as the economies of the United States, New Zealand, \nand then Australia weakened. High international commodity prices fed through with a lag, and \nvery  high  inflation  that  peaked  in  November  2008  at  18.7%  on  a  year-on-year  basis  and \naveraged 13.9% in FY2009 eroded household purchasing power. Tourism arrivals continued to \ngrow, however, helped by the operation of a budget airline, expanding accommodation, and the \ndiversion of tourists from the Fiji Islands (tourism receipts were 22.1% of GDP in FY2009). \n \n4.  The economy contracted by 5.5% in FY2009. From June 2008 to June 2009, the formal \nsector lost 2,035 jobs, a decline of 9.3%, and the number of operating businesses fell from \n4,518 to 3,681. Remittances fell by 17% year-on-year in real terms in the 12 months to June \n2009. The closure of a large tuna cannery in neighboring American Samoa in September 2009 \neliminated up to 1,500 jobs held by Samoans and an important source of remittances. \n \n5.  The economic slowdown weakened the government's revenue performance (Appendix \n4). Tax collections in FY2009 were 4.7% below budget estimates and almost 2% below those of \nFY2008. The real value of government revenue is projected to remain below trend over the \nshort-to-medium term. The weakening in revenue has put pressure on the government\u2019s fiscal \nposition and threatened key programs, particularly the delivery of essential services.  \n \n6.  In  the  absence  of  any  corrective  government  action,  a  further  sizeable  economic \ncontraction seemed likely in FY2010. Declining incomes and remittance flows were projected to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. Forthcoming. Samoa Social and Economic Report 2009: Continuing Growth and Stability and Managing \nDevelopment Risk. Manila. \n2  ADB. Pacific Economic Monitor. Manila (various editions). \n ", "2   \nreduce real consumption, private investment was projected to contract because of lost business \nconfidence and the reduced availability of affordable loans, and exports of manufactured and \nprimary products were projected to remain weak.3 This was the negative outlook despite the \npositive news that tourism arrivals from Australia and New Zealand had begun to improve by \nlate FY2009, Yazaki was expected to begin some re-hiring (which commenced in November \n2009), and inflation continued to ease.  \n \n7.  Although there is a shortage of data on the impacts of the economic slowdown on \nvulnerable members of the community, they were expected to have been put under additional \nstress  by  the  decline  in  remittances  and  local  employment,  the  higher  cost  of  living,  and \npressure on public service delivery. Labor market analysis suggests that the working poor are \nthe most exposed to the effects of the global economic crisis.4 Starting from a position of \nvulnerability, they likely saw their incomes decline when construction, manufacturing, retail, and \nwholesale activity weakened. Low-income families dependent on overseas remittances are also \nlikely  to  have  been  among  those  hit  hardest  by  the  global  economic  crisis.  Women  are \nparticularly exposed as they rely heavily on lower-paid jobs in tourism and manufacturing (e.g., \nwomen accounted for around 80% of Yazaki's workforce). \n \nB.  The September 2009 Tsunami \n \n8.  On 29 September 2009, an earthquake and resultant tsunami hit Samoa, with the effects \nconcentrated in the southeastern coast of the most populated island, Upolu. The waves reached \nup to 400 meters inland, directly affecting more than 5,000 people and leaving 143 dead (10 of \nthem tourists), 5 missing, and 310 injured. In total, 19 villages and their houses, schools, roads, \nutilities, and tourism facilities were damaged or destroyed.5 Households in these areas already \nexperienced more hardship than did other areas of the country. \n \n9.  The tsunami had its main impact in one of the most popular areas for holiday makers. It \nis estimated that 128 rooms and 322 beds were destroyed or damaged, and more than 300 \nbeach fales (traditional huts used by day visitors and budget travelers) were affected. In total, \n10% of tourist accommodation accredited by the Samoa Tourism Authority was affected. Up to \n20 kilometers of beach and reef were at least partly degraded. The extensive damage to tourism \nand other infrastructure will need to be repaired and debris on beaches and in marine areas will \nneed to be removed as part of tsunami recovery. The tsunami can be expected to have a \nbroader impact by changing perceptions of the desirability of Samoa as a holiday destination. \nExtra marketing efforts and discounting are in place to recover lost appeal, further eroding \ntourism\u2019s contribution to the economy. \n \n10.  The government requested support from the World Bank, ADB, AusAID, and United \nNations  agencies  to  conduct  a  quantitative  analysis  of  tsunami  impact  and  provide \nrecommendations for medium- and longer-term recovery and reconstruction. The preliminary \nassessment from the damage and loss assessment is of a 5-year recovery-and-reconstruction \ncost of about $150 million. Two-thirds of this is required to re-establish (i.e., build back better) \nhousing and facilities, with a third of the cost to be incurred in relocating villages to new inland \nsites. The expenditure required from the public sector over the next 5 years is estimated at $100 \n                                                 \n3 For example, the macroeconomic framework released in May 2009 projected a contraction of 0.8% in FY2010, \ndespite factoring in the benefits of a large fiscal stimulus.

", "  3\nmillion, with more than half required in transport and substantial allocations required to health, \neducation, and electricity. \n \n11.  A rapid humanitarian and reconstruction effort is providing a short-term boost to the \neconomy. Higher government expenditure and support from Samoans living overseas and the \nbroader international community for those affected by the tsunami saw a rise in arrivals soon \nafter the tsunami, and economic indicators pointed to an increase in aggregate demand. There \nis expected to be a follow-on lull in arrivals, however, as many family reunion visits (which make \nup around half of Samoa\u2019s visitors) appear to have been brought forward in response to the \ntsunami,  this  is  expected  to  create  a  lull  in  visitor  arrivals  during  2010.  Similarly,  higher \nremittances provided in response to the tsunami could be at the expense of remittances later in \nFY2010 (footnote 2). Latest estimates are for a small economic expansion of 0.8% in FY2010. \n \nC.  Policy Dialogue \n12.  The  National  Economic  Summit  involving  the  private  sector  and  civil  society \norganizations was held on 27 March 2009 to discuss the impact of the global economic crisis on \nSamoan business and society and to formulate a policy response. Following the summit, the \ngovernment  committed  to  stimulating  the  economy  through  an  elevated  level  of  capital \nexpenditure, to (i) counter deterioration in aggregate demand and (ii) implement productivity-\nenhancing  investment  projects.  The  government  also  committed  to  the  continued \nimplementation of public sector management reforms and of microeconomic policies enunciated \nas the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS), 2008\u20132012.6 These reforms and policies \naimed to achieve the national development objectives of improved governance and economic \ngrowth and employment creation led by the private sector. \n \n13.  The government committed to using the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) as \nthe vehicle for implementing an elevated level of capital expenditure. The PSIP directs the \nGovernment's major projects for investment in human and physical capital. It provides (i) an \noverview of ongoing public sector projects; (ii) an overview and a schedule of public sector \npipeline projects from a 3-year perspective; (iii) information on the government\u2019s priority sectors \nand projects for donor consultations and (iv) a mechanism that enables the government to \nobtain, for forward budgetary planning, a balanced level of capital investments throughout the \nperiod of the PSIP.7 With the support of ADB technical assistance, project screening and \napproval procedures have been put in place to guide the prioritization and scheduling of new \nprojects.8  Selection  criteria  emphasize  ensuring  alignment  with  the  SDS  2008-2012, \nGovernment policy and sector plans, financial sustainability and ensuring that projects are \nenvironmentally sound.9 \n \n14.  The  government  initiated  a  complementary  dialogue  with  development  partners  to \nsecure the concessional financing needed to implement the PSIP and select technical support \nfor the proposed policy actions. Development partners responded through a regional dialogue \n                                                 \n6  Government of Samoa. 2008.

The  policy  dialogue  culminated  in  the  government\u2019s  adoption  of  a  sequenced  and \nprioritized  policy  matrix  that  encompassed  actions  to  address  post-tsunami  reconstruction \nneeds (Table 1). Key underpinnings of the policy matrix are the SDS 2008\u20132012 and supporting \nsector plans, the FY2010 budget statement and fiscal strategy, and recent cabinet decisions. \nDevelopment partners committed to using this policy matrix as a basis for policy-based grants \nand  loans  envisaged  over  the  short-to-medium  term.

International Monetary Fund Assessment \n16.  In response to the balance of payments impact of the tsunami, the IMF released $9.3 \nmillion under the Exogenous Shocks Facility in December 2009. The IMF estimated that its \nfinancing would help keep Samoa\u2019s official reserves at about 3.5 months of prospective imports \n(of goods and services), in line with past trends and a recommended temporary lowering of the \nofficial reserves target to 3 months of current imports. The IMF noted its support was not a \nsubstitute for concessional loans and grants but would play a catalytic role in securing needed \nfinancial assistance from ADB, the World Bank, and other development partners. The IMF \nhighlighted the authorities\u2019 good track record in pursuing prudent fiscal policies and steadfast \nstructural reform, and that policies have been consistent with IMF advice.10  \n \n17.  The IMF also highlighted the authorities\u2019 swift response to the disaster and noted that \nrecovery plans are consistent with safeguarding Samoa\u2019s social and economic progress and \nmacroeconomic stability. It assessed fiscal policies to be appropriately focused on allocating \ndevelopment  spending  to  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  allocating  non-priority  current \nspending to providing basic social services. The authorities\u2019 commitment to their strategy for \nmanaging  public  debt  and  to  meeting  the  remaining  financing  needs  primarily  through \nconcessional external financing and grants was seen as an anchor for macroeconomic stability. \nA debt-sustainability analysis concluded that even after taking into account the large deficits \nenvisaged from FY2010 to FY2012, the debt outlook remained favorable and Samoa continued \nto be at low risk of debt distress.  \n                                                 \n10 IMF. 2010.

THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The  impact  of  the  program  will  be  the  achievement  of  higher  and  more  inclusive \neconomic growth. The outcome of the program will be the initiation of economic recovery with \nextra protection for the vulnerable and the country\u2019s fiscal position. The impact and outcome will \nbe achieved by helping meet the government\u2019s budget financing needs, which have been \nincreased by the 2009 tsunami, and through support for the government\u2019s policy agenda.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework \n \n19.  The  economic  slowdown  follows  an  extended  period  of  economic  growth.  Political \nstability facilitated Samoa\u2019s implementation of far-reaching and important reforms that achieved \ngood development results (Appendix 5). An early return to moderate rates of economic growth \nis possible and sustainable if the damage from the tsunami is quickly repaired and additional \nsupport  is  provided  to  the  private  sector.  Tourism,  agriculture,  and  fishing  can  be  vibrant \nsources of employment and economic growth, building on Samoa\u2019s natural beauty, a well-\neducated labor force, and ample land and marine resources.  \n \n20.  The tsunami intensifies the imperative to strengthen economic and fiscal management. \nReconstruction is likely to provide a short-term economic stimulus, but only temporarily as it will \nbe driven by a rise in the government\u2019s capital expenditure that will need to be wound back over \nthe medium term. A deepening of policy action will improve economic prospects in tsunami-\naffected areas and help build the private sector so it can lead economic growth as the stimulus \nfrom  government  expenditure  winds  down.  Stronger  medium-term  economic  growth \nperformance will be important for building the fiscal capacity needed to service public debt \nincurred in post-tsunami reconstruction. \n \nC.  Policy Actions \n \n21.  The ERSP provides for elevated government capital expenditure to undertake post-\ntsunami  reconstruction  and  provide  a  short-term  boost  to  the  economy  (output  1). \nComplementary policy actions will safeguard the overall fiscal position and enhance the quality \nof government expenditure (output 2). Structural and governance improvements will support \nmedium-term prospects for economic growth by enhancing the economy's productivity (output \n3). Policy actions will provide opportunities for the vulnerable to make economic growth more \ninclusive (output 4). The engagement of private sector and civil society stakeholders in public \npolicy will be enhanced to deepen local awareness, understanding, and ownership of the ERSP \n(output 5). These five outputs will progress concurrently under the two subprograms of the \nERSP. \n \n22.  The policy actions target economic growth led by the private sector.11 At the macro level, \nthe ERSP will assist the private sector by supporting aggregate demand and lessening the risk \nthat  fiscal  stress  will  bring  macroeconomic  instability.  At  the  micro  level,  the  ERSP  will \nemphasize ensuring sound public investment, continuing to rationalize state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs), improving the performance of those that remain under government ownership, ensuring \neffective competition in the economy, and thorough efforts to modernize the legal framework \naffecting the formal business sector to lower the cost of doing business. \n                                                 \n11 This reflects the government\u2019s recognition of the central role to be played by the private sector in promoting \neconomic growth, as written into the SDS 2008\u20132012 and its most recent predecessors.  ", "  7\n \n23.  The policy actions of the ERSP are based on the near- and short-term actions of the \ngovernment\u2019s own policy matrix and develop the foundation upon which the government can \nimplement the priority actions for the medium term (Table 1).12 The program is designed to \nremain within the existing capacity of the public sector, supplemented in certain areas by \nassistance from development partners. These design features are adopted to enhance country \nownership and the sustainability of outcomes.  \n \n1.  Output 1: Addressing Post-Tsunami Reconstruction \n24.  Policy actions. Subprogram 1 will support elevated capital expenditure in the FY2010 \nbudget.13 Capital expenditure will follow the interim PSIP, which incorporates a costed tsunami \nrecovery plan and continues to fund a portion of previously planned investments (e.g., road \nnetwork  upgrades,  rural  access  roads,  public  buildings,  energy  projects,  and  sanitation \nimprovements). Subprogram 2 will reinforce this in FY2011.  \n \n25.  The FY2010 budget provides for a high level of capital expenditure for FY2010 and an \nassociated  high  budget  deficit  (Table  2).  Most  of  the  capital  expenditure  for  FY2010  was \nplanned for roads, public buildings, and schools. The capital expenditure planned for FY2010 \nand the out years now needs to accommodate tsunami reconstruction.  \n \n26.  A  FY2010  first  supplementary  budget  provided  for  an  additional  $27.7 million  in \nexpenditure for priority tsunami relief and reconstruction activities, that will be largely funded \nfrom  additional  grants  (Tables  3  and  4).14  The  expenditure  provided  for  by  the  first \nsupplementary budget is in addition to tsunami relief and reconstruction activities funded from \nthe original FY2010 budget appropriation. \n \n27.  To reflect the additional needs arising from the tsunami, an interim update of the PSIP \nwas  undertaken  through  the  FY2010  first  supplementary  budget  process.15  The  update \nincorporated  a  costed  tsunami  recovery  plan  (Table  5).  This  plan  drew  on  reconstruction \nproposals  prepared  by  ministries  and  SOEs  and  was  informed  by  the  Damage  and  Loss \nAssessment and Early Recovery Framework prepared following the tsunami.  \n                                                 \n12 The formulation of the ERSP has also drawn on diagnostics presented in ADB. 2007.

The  output  is  directed  to  achieving  the  medium-term  goals  of  fiscal  discipline  and \nimproving transparency, accountability, efficiency, and equity in the use of public funds.  \n \na.  Maintenance of Overall Fiscal Discipline \n \n29.  Policy  actions.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  FY2010  budget  was  prepared  against  a \nmedium-term expenditure framework that included a fiscal strategy statement, the preparation \nof forward estimates, and a statement of government operations prepared in accordance with \nIMF's Government Finance Statistics standards.16 The subprogram ensured adherence by the \nFY2010  budget  to  the  principle  of  responsible  fiscal  management  of  the  Public  Finance \nManagement Act 2001; no rise in public sector salaries; and the preparation of an interim \nupdate of the medium-term expenditure framework to account for the impact of the tsunami. \nTaken together, these actions ensure a fiscally sustainable FY2010 budget. Subprogram 2 \nprovides for maintaining a medium-term expenditure framework that is consistent with fiscal \nsustainability preserving low risk of debt distress as assessed by the IMF.  \n \n30.  The government framed the FY2010 budget with the intent of easing and slowing down \nthe pace of the shock arising from the global economic crisis. Balancing the short-term need \nand the need for fiscal restraint over the medium term, the budget was framed against the \nfollowing elements: \n(i)  investment in capital projects that would help stimulate growth, especially in \nconstruction; \n(ii)  ensuring people's needs were met; \n(iii)  prioritizing expenditures to ensure that the priorities stated in the SDS 2008\u2013\n2012 were not overly compromised;  \n(iv)  maintaining public sector wage restraint (a salaries tribunal recommendation for \na 10% civil service wage rise was not included in the FY2009 budget); \n(v)  no  additional  revenue  raising  through  tax  increases,  as  this  would  further \ndisadvantage businesses and consumers alike; and \n(vi)  seeking assistance from development partners to provide some form of budget \nsupport to fund the expected deficit. \n \n31.  Principles of fiscal responsibility. Such decisions were guided by the principles of \nfiscal responsibility established in the Public Finance Management Act 2001: \n(i)  management of total state debt at prudent levels to provide a buffer against \nfactors that may adversely affect total state debt in the future; \n(ii)  ensuring that within any borrowing program the total expenditures of the state are \nnot more than total receipts (inclusive of borrowings) in that financial year; \n(iii)  achieving and maintaining levels of the state\u2019s net worth that will provide a buffer \nagainst factors that may adversely affect the state\u2019s net worth; \n(iv)  managing prudently the fiscal risks facing the state; \n(v)  pursuing policies that are consistent with a reasonable degree of predictability \nabout the level and stability of tax rates for future years; and \n                                                 \n16  The government received technical assistance from ADB in support of these actions, in particular through the \ndevelopment  of  the  Samoa  economic  and  revenue  forecasting  model,  assistance  with  medium-term  fiscal \nframework development, the development of manuals and training in the preparation of government finance \nstatistics, project planning and appraisal, and monitoring and evaluation.

", "  11\n(vi)  ensuring that the policies stipulated in the SDS and fiscal policies approved by \nthe cabinet are in agreement with the fiscal limit that will be applied to current \nand future expenditures on ministries and government projects. \n \n32.  Fiscal strategy and medium-term expenditure framework. The fiscal strategy of the \nFY2010 budget highlighted the potential for economic deterioration and the planned increase in \ncapital expenditure to result in a budget deficit above the target range set in the SDS 2008\u2013\n2012.17 This would result in turn in the government sector exceeding its target of 40% of GDP. \nOther key fiscal parameters, specifically those set for current expenditure and personnel costs, \nwere projected to remain within the target range set in the SDS 2008\u20132012.18 Drawing on this \nassessment, and to ensure compliance with the principles of fiscal responsibility, the forward \nestimates of the FY2010 budget set out an adjustment path for key fiscal parameters.19  \n \n33.  The  FY2010  budget  was  only  the  second  budget  to  present  forward  estimates  of \nrevenue and expenditure, which cover the 2 following years. These were summarized in a \nstatement of government operations prepared in accordance with IMF's Government Finance \nStatistics  standards.  The  inclusion  of  such  estimates  enables  the  government  to  better \nunderstand  the  medium-term  impacts  of  its  policy  decisions  and  act  to  improve  budget \ntransparency.  \n \n34.  The FY2010 supplementary budget provided an interim update of the medium-term \nframework, taking into account the fiscal pressures arising from the tsunami. It set a target of \nreducing government sector debt to 40% of GDP in FY2013.20 \n \n35.  Expenditure adjustments. Expenditure proposals for the FY2010 budget were subject \nto closer scrutiny, and some lower-priority initiatives were trimmed. Cuts were made to selected \noperating expenditure and minor capital items: all vacancies and new positions, except those \nprioritized by the budget committee and those under recruitment, will not be filled; allocations for \ntravel, catering, and donations have been reduced; efforts were made to trim unnecessary fuel \nuse, and all expenditure on new vehicles was removed; and overtime provisions were largely \nremoved (except for ST1 million in overtime for key services, e.g., nurses and doctors) and \nreplaced by flexitime arrangements.21  \n \n36.  As part of expenditure control, the government made the politically difficult decision in \nFY2010 to reject the salaries tribunal recommendation for a 10% civil service wage rise and did \nnot include any rise in public sector salaries in the budget.  \n                                                 \n17  The Public Finance Management Act 2001 requires that the budget be accompanied by a statement on the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal strategy. The statement is required to (i) include an assessment of the extent to which the \nbudget statement is consistent with Samoa\u2019s current SDS; (ii) include an explanation of the reasons for any \nsignificant differences between the economic and financial situation of the state and the information and intentions \npresented in the current SDS and previous fiscal policy statement; (iii) where the circumstances have changed, \npresent an amended set of intentions; and (iv) provide projections of movements in the key variables that \ndemonstrate intended progress toward achieving the longer-term objectives specified in the current SDS and the  \nfiscal policy statement, as well as stating the significant assumptions on which the projections are based. \n18 Samoa Ministry of Finance. 2009.

The government adopted the switch to facilitate the importation \nof cheaper vehicles from New Zealand and Australia. A range of public and private costs were incurred in the \nswitch (e.g., re-equipping and modifying vehicle fleets; changing road signage, road markings, traffic lights, etc.; \nand education and awareness programs). There was considerable public opposition to the switch. The switch itself \noccurred smoothly, though, and opposition to it has since dissipated. \n ", "12  \n \n37.  Key  budget  risks.  Government  revenue  was  on  target  as  of  mid-FY2010.  Careful \nattention will thus be needed to restrain operating expenditure to no more than budget levels in \nFY2010, ensure planned cuts are achieved, and avoid potential fiscal pressures from new \nexpenditure  initiatives.  Most  expenditure  cuts  were  across  the  board,  rather  than  tightly \nprioritized activities and agencies. It may also become necessary to reprioritize during the year \nto achieve the delivery of the most important budget outputs. Policy dialogue in the development \nof subprogram 2 will focus on these issues with the objective of mitigating risks and ensuring the \nmaintenance  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  that  is  consistent  with  fiscal \nsustainability by preserving low risk of debt distress as assessed by the IMF.  \n \nb.  Enhanced Public Financial Management \n38.  Policy  actions.  Stage  1  of  a  public  finance  management  (PFM)  reform  plan  was \ninitiated under subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 provides for completing stage 1 and initiating stage \n2, as well as publicly releasing the 2010 IMF Article IV staff report. These actions are to improve \ntransparency, accountability, efficiency, and equity in the use of public funds. \n \n39.  Public finance management reform plan, 2008\u20132010. The PFM reform plan, prepared \nto strengthening public financial management systems and promote the efficient use of public \nresources, was approved by the Cabinet Development Committee in September 2008.22 It was \nset up as a response to weaknesses in public finance management identified under Samoa\u2019s \nfirst Public Expenditure Financial Accountability assessment. A second assessment was carried \nout in February 2010 together with a Debt Management Performance assessment. The plan \ncovers the legal and regulatory framework, institutional arrangements, management systems, \nand capacity development, adopting a sequenced approach to achieving fiscal discipline and \nimproving the strategic allocation of resources.  \n \n40.  Stage 1 focuses on improving the reconciliation and reporting of public accounts and the \nrelated strengthening of internal control systems, as the bases from which to proceed to higher-\nlevel reforms. Key actions undertaken as part of stage 1 include (i) the timely production of \naccurate public accounts against a target of ensuring that public accounts are finalized within 4 \nmonths of year\u2019s end; (ii) cash flow monitoring and management, including the Ministry of \nFinance\u2019s establishment of a cash management committee; (iii) strengthened audit, including \nthe adoption of international audit guidelines and the adoption by the chief auditor\u2019s office of  \nnew audit standard manuals and methodological guidelines for quality control; (iv) strengthened \nprocurement procedures, including the establishment and public release of new procurement \nguidelines and the preparation of standard tender and contract formats for works, supplies, and \nservices;23 and (v) improved arrears management. The cabinet created a PFM reform steering \ncommittee, including representatives of Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Revenue, and \nthe auditor general, responsible for overseeing and monitoring PFM reform plan implementation \nand reporting on progress.  \n \n41.  Revenue  initiatives.  The  PFM  reform  plan  sets  out  intended  reforms  in  revenue \ncollection  through  (i)  the  restructuring  of  the  tax  administration  sections  in  the  Ministry  of \nRevenue to improve efficiency and introduce a new client orientation, and (ii) the introduction of \n                                                 \n22  The PFM Reform Plan (Stage 1) is funded by the Public Sector Investment Facility.  \n23  The standard bidding documents for goods and works, as well as a procurement manual, are being reviewed by \nthe ADB Central Operations and Services Office as part of the exercise to review national procurement procedures \nand to develop national competitive bidding procedures for Samoa. ", "  13\na new database information system for income tax collection and monitoring with links to the \nautomated system for customs data and Finance One, the budget system in use in Samoa. \n \n42.  Next steps. The PFM reform plan is seen as an evolutionary process that will be \nupdated through annual reviews. The second stage of the PFM reform plan for 2011\u20132013 will \nimprove transparency and efficiency in budgeting. The focus is to strengthen performance \nmonitoring  in  the  context  of  the  further  development  of  the  3-year  rolling  medium-term \nexpenditure framework introduced in FY2009, including the formulation of sector-wide strategies \nand investment plans that will be used for setting output targets linked to budget allocations and \nmonitoring sector performance. Under the PFM reform plan, the budget and planning committee \nin  MOF  is  to  be  revitalized  to  review  submissions  from  line  ministries,  provide  advice  on \nimprovements required, and provide general policy support to strengthen output definition and \nperformance  monitoring.  This  will  significantly  enhance  performance  focus,  line  ministry \nengagement, and the effectiveness of the budget process. The next public expenditure and \nfinancial accountability assessment, planned for 2012, will provide an important input into the \nevolution of the reform plan.  \n \n3.   Output 3: Productivity-Enhancing Structural and Governance \nImprovements \na.  Enhanced Economic Contribution of SOEs \n43.  Policy actions. Under subprogram 1 the cabinet prioritized initiatives to raise the pace \nof SOE reform, implementation of an action plan commenced to move SOEs to full compliance \nby  end-2010  with  the  Public  Bodies  (Performance  and  Accountability)  Act  2001  on  the \nappointment of board members, the liberalization of telecommunications sector was completed \n(by not renewing SamoaTel\u2019s exclusive license), a bill was endorsed by the Cabinet for the \ncreation of the Office of the Power Regulator, and electricity tariffs were increased by 8.5% to \nbring them closer to the cost of operations. Subprogram 2 provides for the SOEs to be fully \ncompliant by end-2010 with the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act 2001 on the \nappointment of board members, for the privatization of SamoaTel and gazettal of the legislation \nwhat will establish the Office of the Power Regulator. \n \n44.  There has recently been renewed commitment to improving SOE performance. This \nfollowed a subregional seminar on SOE performance sponsored by ADB in early 2009 to \npromote the findings of a comparative review of SOE reform performance in the Fiji Islands, \nSamoa, and Tonga.24 A key result of the seminar was the March 2009 decision of the Samoa \ncabinet, sponsored by the Prime Minister, that (i) ministers and ex-officio board members must \nstep down by June 2010, (ii) SOEs must achieve a minimum return of 7% or chief executive \nofficers and boards face removal from office; (iii) community service obligations (CSOs) can be \npaid only with prior cabinet and MOF approval; and (iv) 50% of profits must be paid to the \ngovernment as a dividend. \n \n45.  Action plan on membership of SOE boards. The action plan will move SOEs to full \ncompliance with Samoa's Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act 2001 in relation \nto board membership (the action plan is summarized in Appendix 6). The aim is to replace all \nmembers  of  Parliament  and  nonessential  public  servants  on  the  boards  of  SOEs  with \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2009.

All essential public servants appointees to boards\u2014required, for example, for their \ntechnical skills or sector experience\u2014will be appointed only in accordance with the legislation \n(schedule  3  of  the  regulations)  and  will  not  receive  directors\u2019  fees.  This  requires  some \nsupporting  legislative  amendments,  as  12  individual  SOE  acts  prescribe  the  presence  of \nministers  and  ex-officio  members  on  their  boards.  The  action  plan  also  provides  for \nestablishment of a process for selecting and appointing directors of SOEs and an Independent \nSelection Committee for the directors of SOEs. \n \n46.  Telecommunications  deregulation  and  privatization.  Wide-ranging  reforms  in \ntelecommunications initiated in 2004 have allowed new entrants to be established in mobile \ntelecommunications and the internet. Competition has driven the costs of international mobile \nphone calls down by 50%\u201367%, internet usage has blossomed, and total teledensity rose to an \nestimated 30 lines per 100 people in 2006\u201411 of them fixed line and 19 mobile (footnote 1). \nThe  opening  of  the  telecommunications  market  to  competition  was  completed  in  2009  by \nallowing SamoaTel's sole license for the operation of an international gateway and its sole \nlicense  for the  operation  of  landlines  to  expire.  Completing  the  privatization  of  SamoaTel, \nsupported by the World Bank, is expected in first quarter of FY2010, will provide important \nfunding for the government to meet medium-term budget needs.26 \n \n47.  Power sector reform. The power sector is to follow telecommunications along the path \nof  progressive  reform  and  opening  to  competition.  The  main  near-term  opportunities  for \ncompetition are in proven renewable energy technologies (i.e., hydro, wind, solar, biomass, and \ngeothermal). As an initial step toward competition, regulatory powers are to be separated from \nthe electricity utility. A new electricity act was prepared under subprogram 1 to establish the \nOffice of the Power Regulator. The act will be approved under subprogram 2 as a further step \ntowards making the office operational. These reforms complement other actions under the \nPower Sector Expansion Project, which is supported by ADB and the governments of Australia \nand Japan.27 The project provides for expanding generation capacity, improving the efficiency of \ntransmission and distribution systems, reviewing the tariff structure, institutional strengthening in \nthe electricity utility, and reviewing CSOs to be met by the utility. \n \n48.  The SDS 2008\u20132012 restates the government\u2019s commitment to retaining ownership only \nof those enterprises that have significant strategic, security, or social importance (Samoa Airport \nAuthority, Electric Power Corporation, Samoa Ports Authority, Samoa Water Authority, and \nSamoa Shipping Corporation) and of improving the corporate governance and performance of \nSOEs. Nonstrategic SOEs are all considered under the SDS to be suitable for privatization, \nprovided that appropriate regulatory frameworks are in place to ensure that service quality and \ncost are maintained or improved under private ownership.  \n \n49.  Next steps. The SDS 2008\u20132012 provides for investigating the establishment of a single \nregulatory body or competition agency to take on the task of preventing the abuse of monopoly \npowers held by privatized SOEs, taking account of the role of the existing sector regulators and \n                                                 \n25  The extension of the original target date of June 2010 to end-2010 reflects the extra demands arising from tsunami   \nrelief and reconstruction. \n26 SamoaTel's equity alone was valued at $25 million in 2008. \n27  ADB. 2007.

", "  15\nthe provisions of the Fair Trading Act. Such a body has the potential to modernize economic \nregulation across the economy and minimize the duplication of economic regulation functions \nacross sectors. SOE performance can also be enhanced by improving the management of \nCSOs.  In  the  past,  the  exact  nature  of  CSOs  and  their  rationale  has  not  been  clear,  so \nestimating their benefits and costs and considering alternative delivery mechanisms has been \ndifficult.  The  Public  Bodies  (Performance  and  Accountability)  Act  2001  and  its  regulations \ncontain a very clear and robust process for identifying, documenting, and costing CSOs. A draft \nnew CSO policy has been prepared regarding the provision of electricity and water CSOs. \nAdherence  to  this  process  by  boards  and  responsible  ministers  would  achieve  immediate \nimprovements in the performance and accountability of SOEs and in the delivery of public \nservices. \n \nb.  Reduce the Cost of Doing Business \n50.  Policy actions. The SDS 2008\u20132012 provides for reforming components of the legal \nframework that unnecessarily adds to the cost of establishing and operating a business. The \ngovernment has made progress through the implementation of the Companies Amendment Act \n2006.  Subprogram  2  advances  this  agenda  by  refining  the  Foreign  Investment  Act  2000, \nincluding a review of the restricted list, and passage of the personal property securities bill. \nPrepared with ADB assistance, the bill will provide a modern legal framework for lending and \ndebt collection (Appendix 3, section C5).28 \n \n4:   Output 4: Support the Vulnerable through Targeted Actions \n51.  The government recognizes that areas for improvement remain in setting priorities and \ntargeting  and  delivering  support  services  to  the  vulnerable.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment  has  taken  a  number  of  practical  steps  that  demonstrate  its  commitment  to \nsupporting the vulnerable. These are (i) meeting the immediate housing and other basic needs \nof tsunami-affected communities and addressing their interim needs; (ii) a housing program, \nnow under way, to assist those affected by the tsunami; and (iii) cabinet approval of a school fee \nrelief scheme at primary school level. Subprogram 2 builds upon these actions by supporting \nthe creation of a framework for future support to the vulnerable, through providing for the \npreparation and release of a concept paper on the needs of the vulnerable and the incorporation \nof key interventions into the sector planning process. Additionally, the implementation of the \nschool  fee  scheme  will  continue,  and  the  findings  of  the  2008  household  income  and \nexpenditure  survey  will  be  publicized.  These  actions  will  advance  the  broader  agenda  of \nensuring that the provision of extra support for the most vulnerable members of the community \nis included among the core tasks of government. \n \n52.  Immediate  response  to  the  tsunami.  The  government  responded  early  to  the \ndestruction caused by the tsunami. Extensive support was immediately provided to affected \ncommunities with humanitarian help from the international community. Temporary housing was \nprovided, along with food, water, and clothing; extra health care was mobilized; and action \ncommenced to reestablish public services. The response was coordinated by the Disaster \nAdvisory Council, which was supported by the National Disaster Management Office and other \ngovernment line ministries. An interagency standing committee was established under United \nNations leadership, and by 6 October 2009 there were 35 international agencies participating \nactively  in  a  cluster  system  (15  United  Nations  agencies,  17  international  and  national \nnongovernment organizations, and 3 bilateral partners).  \n                                                 \n28  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative. Manila (TA 6353-REG); ADB. \n2009. Technical Assistance for Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase II. Manila (TA 7430-REG). \n ", "16  \n \n53.  The early recovery framework. The government requested the preparation of an early \nrecovery framework led by the interagency standing committee. The framework focuses on \nrestoring the basic foundations that will allow people to begin to rebuild their lives and bridging \nthe  transition  period  from  the  relief  phase  to  the  recovery  phase.  It  provides  a  detailed \nassessment of a range of sectors and activities taking into account the capacity, strengths, and \nresilience of both local communities and the government. The key areas of strategic intervention \nidentified  as  requiring  attention  were  resettlement,  access  to  basic  social  services  and \ninfrastructure,  livelihoods,  disaster  risk  reduction  in  light  of  climate  change,  and  the \nenvironment. Under this framework, assistance will target the needs of 5,274 affected people in \nan area with a total population of 11,121. \n \n54.  Assistance for housing. The efficiency of the response phase of the disaster led by the \ngovernment and coordinated by the National Disaster Management Office, coupled with the \nlocalized impact of the tsunami, allowed for a speedy transition into an early recovery phase. \nThe customary land tenure system meant that all people affected had access to plantation lands \ninland  to  which  they  moved  immediately  after  the  disaster.  Many  have  expressed  strong \ndetermination to remain there. This facilitated the quick commencement of the construction of \npermanent housing such as the traditional fale. The government has launched, with grant \nsupport from various donors, a housing subsidy scheme to allow tsunami-affected families to \nrebuild their houses.  \n \n55.  School fee relief scheme. In response to the adverse impact of the global economic \ncrisis on the vulnerable, the FY2010 budget announced the adoption of a targeted scheme to \nmeet the cost of primary school fees over the medium term. The aim is to keep in school those \nwho would otherwise drop out due to financial constraints\u2014it has been estimated that around \n10% of the school age population faces such a risk AusAID and NZAID are assisting the \nimplementation of the scheme, which constitutes one of the few public programs that specifically \ntarget the vulnerable. The First Supplementary Budget FY2010 announced the fast tracking of \nthis scheme which will allow for the non-payment of school fees for students in government and \nmission schools at the primary level. Importantly, Government is committed to fully funding the \nscheme on a graduating basis at the end of the first three years. \n \n56.  Policy in support of the vulnerable. Samoa has a very small official social welfare \nsystem, and Government policy towards meeting the needs of the vulnerable has emphasized \nemployment  creation  and  education  (Appendix  7).  The  Senior  Citizens  Pension  Scheme \nadministered by the Samoa National Provident Fund provides T$125/month to everyone over \nthe age of 65, but is untargeted. Likewise, Government support for primary and curative health \nservices, as well as support for education, generally does not specifically target the vulnerable. \nPublic  policy  also  implicitly  relies  on  community  and  family-based  support.  Such  support \nmechanisms  remain  strong  in  Samoa,  as  readily  evidenced  by  the  considerable  support \nprovided by Samoans living overseas following the tsunami. Nevertheless, they are better suited \nto addressing impacts that are localized or felt within a relatively small share of the population, \nas opposed to the generalized shock imposed by high inflation and the global economic crisis. \nThe new impacts arising from the global economic crisis and then the tsunami add to the \ninformation gap on the definition of the \u2018vulnerable\u2019 and their needs. Actions will be taken under \nthe ERSP to seek to fill this gap. A concept paper on the needs of the vulnerable will be \nreleased so that key policy actions in support of the vulnerable can be factored into the budget \nprocess and preparation of the next SDS. The wide distribution of findings from the latest \nhousehold income and expenditure survey will support the policy formulation process. \n ", "  17\n5.   Output 5: Consultation and Engagement of Stakeholders \n57.  Policy  actions.  Under  subprogram  1,  communications  and  engagement  with  key \nexternal stakeholders was enhanced to explain key policy actions, including (i) the government\u2019s \nresponse to the global economic crisis and the reconstruction needs of the tsunami, (ii) the \npriorities in the PSIP, (iii) the state of public finances and PFM reform, and (iv) government \nactions to address the needs of the most vulnerable. It further provides for effective feedback \nfrom  the  private  sector  and  civil  society.  The  enhanced engagement  is  to  continue  under \nsubprogram 2. \n \n58.  The government already places considerable public finance and sector information in the \npublic domain, publishing key documents and statistics on government websites in a timely and \ncomprehensive manner. There is also a track record of public consultation on and participation \nin key development issues, such as in the development of SDSs. The enhanced communication \nand  engagement  efforts  adopted  through  this program  will  build  on  this  strong base.  The \nprogram addresses lessons from ADB experience in implementing programs that developing \nlocal awareness, understanding, and ownership of programs is critical to their success. \n \nD.  Triggers for Subprogram 2 \n \n59.  The development policy letter (Appendix 2) sets out the government\u2019s reform agenda for \nthe next 2 years, building on reform momentum from subprogram 1. Triggers for subprogram 2 \nare described in the policy matrix attached to the development policy letter. The indicative \nmilestones for subprogram 2 that can be monitored are listed in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). \n \n60.  Building on reforms under subprogram 1, subprogram 2 is expected to be implemented \nin 2011, and, subject to Board approval, will be financed by ADB. Subprogram 2 will continue to \nfocus on fiscal consolidation but with more attention to improving infrastructure investment and \ngovernance to sustain higher growth, as well as progress in other areas that may emerge from \npolicy  dialogue  and  engagement  with  the  government  in  2010  and  2011.  The  expected \ntimeframe for processing subprogram 2 is only indicative, with allowance for delay. \n \n61.  While subprogram 2 contains targeted policy actions, the program cluster approach \nallows an appropriate policy response to unanticipated changes in the external environment. \nThe conditions for releasing the subprogram 2 tranche will not be specified at the outset of the \nERSP but will be determined in consultation with the government on the bases of lessons from \nsubprogram 1. These conditions are likely to be in the policy areas set out in the subprogram 2 \ntriggers. This approach will ensure that the ERSP is synchronized with the government\u2019s policy \nagenda and responsive to external environmental factors. \n \nE.  Responding to Lessons \n \n62.  The cluster approach responds to the lesson that program lending has not always been \nfirmly  based  on  an  assessment  of  achievable  rates  of  change  and  that  its  rigidity  has \ncontributed to program delays.29 In this case, risk was heightened by the imperative for an early \ninitial disbursement as a short-term boost to the economy. This heightened the risk that program \n                                                 \n29 Key sources of lessons are ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "18  \npreparation would be too compressed. The cluster approach gives the ERSP flexibility to tailor \nthe details and timing of policy actions to Samoa\u2019s circumstances during the formulation of the \nsecond subprogram. This has been achieved by allowing government and other development \npartners' resources to focus on the most immediate policy actions and making more time \navailable for considering follow-on actions. \n \n63.  The creation of new structures and processes can erode country ownership and has \ntherefore been avoided. The preparation of the ERSP has thus emphasized the use of existing \ninstitutional structures and enhancing existing systems and processes.  \n \n64.  Country ownership and endorsement is facilitated by relatively simple scope that avoids \nthe overly complex programs developed for the Pacific in the 1990s. Keeping the program \nrealistic and firmly within the capacity of Samoa enhances prospects for sustainable impacts. \nThe sequencing of actions has helped keep the scope simple, facilitating communication and \nencouraging broad endorsement of the program. \n \n65.  The recent ADB evaluation of its program lending in the Pacific highlights the importance \nto program success of encouraging the private sector. The ERSP responds to this by helping \nthe private sector, at both the macro and micro levels. \n \n66.  Program lending evaluations have supported the basic rule that consultation with, and \nunderstanding by, affected groups and sectors helps create a climate for change and enhances \nthe sustainability of public policy reform. The ERSP applies this principle by (i) being anchored \nin the SDS 2008\u20132012 and sector plans and the FY2010 budget; (ii) drawing on the diagnostic \nwork of the latest Pacific Island economic report, which incorporated the findings of extensive \nconsultation;30  and  (iii)  including  as  one  of  five  output  areas  actions  to  provide  for  public \ncommunication and ownership of economic and fiscal management initiatives. This alignment \nwith government-led initiatives accords with commitments in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nto  focus  on  planning,  capacity  development,  and  institutional  reform  to  support  sustained \ninfrastructure development.  \n \n67.  The need for the long-term perspective and commitment identified by evaluation studies \nis recognized in the ERSP. The ERSP is seen as the next step in a long-term, sequenced \nreform process. Most policy actions build on earlier support from Samoa's key development \npartners. ADB shares the long-term commitment made by other development partners to secure \nsustainable economic growth and development in Samoa. ADB support continues with the \nprovision through technical assistance (TA) of the specialist skills needed to advance the policy \nagenda. The policy matrix identifies medium-term program directions as guides to the support \nthat could follow the ERSP.  \n \n68.  Program design is built on (i) the wide-ranging diagnostic analysis presented in the draft \nSamoa 2009 Social and Economic Report: Equity in Development prepared by ADB (footnote \n1); (ii) the policy framework presented in ADB's Taking the Helm: A Policy Brief on a Response \nto the Global Crisis;31 and (iii) an ongoing policy dialogue among the government, development \npartners, the private sector, and civil society representatives.  \n \n                                                 \n30 ADB.  2009.

ADB support is harmonized with that of AusAID, the EU, NZAID, and the World Bank in \nresponse to the global economic crisis and the tsunami. All agencies are aligning support to the \nsame government-led policy framework. The ERSP is also in line with the IMF's assessment of \npost-tsunami  needs,  notably  concessional  external  financing  and  the  pursuit  of  fiscal \nconsolidation over the medium term. \n \n70.  Support for the vulnerable is a feature of the program in recognition of the extra hardship \nimposed by the tsunami, global economic crisis, and preceding episode of high international \ncommodity  prices.  This  support  will  facilitate  a  progressive  reorientation  of  government \nprograms to target the most vulnerable. It is proposed that the ERSP will link to a Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction grant for social protection that will support the piloting of social safety nets \nand associated policy development.32 \n \nG.  Financing Plan \n \n71.  The government has requested assistance in the form of a program cluster worth up to \n$26.8 million equivalent and comprising two subprograms, one amounting to $16.0 million \nequivalent and the other $10.8 million equivalent. ADB will provide a loan in various currencies \nequivalent to $16 million for subprogram 1 from its Special Funds resources. The program loan \nwill have a term of 24 years including a grace period of 8 years with an interest charge of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The remaining adjustment costs will be \nmet by the government. \n \n72.  Loan size has been determined after due consideration of (i) the estimated impact of the \nglobal  economic  crisis  and  the  tsunami;  (ii)  the  national  budget\u2019s  projected  financing \nrequirement and the government's stated intention (as advised in the FY2010 Budget) to draw \non ADB financing to help meet it; (iii) the significance and complexity of the ERSP policy \nactions; and (v) the ERSP\u2019s conformity with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2008\u20132012.33 \nLoan size also recognizes the contribution that will be made to protecting the most vulnerable \nmembers of the community and the government\u2019s demonstrated commitment to implementing a \npolicy agenda. \n \n                                                 \n32  The proposed project will extend targeted support to vulnerable groups such as women, unemployed youths, and \npeople living with disabilities through the development and piloting of semiformal social safety net models that \nbuild on existing informal community mechanisms. The proposed project will also provide for a participatory, \ncountry-led process of social-protection policy development to better identify and understand how to address the \nneeds of the vulnerable.  \n33 The country partnership strategy supports SDS implementation in alignment with the objectives of the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness of 2005. The strategy focuses on poverty reduction by addressing binding \nconstraints to growth through interventions related to (i) improving the delivery of public services, including by \nremoving  infrastructure  constraints,  and  (ii)  promoting  private  sector  development.

A program coordinating committee, comprising MOF and the Central Bank of \nSamoa,  has  been  established  and  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  similar  programs \nprepared with development partners. The program coordinating committee will meet at least \nquarterly to monitor progress, oversee the implementation of the program, and guide and direct \nthe activities of the executing agency. The committee will liaise with other sector committees \nand invite, as appropriate, line agencies of the borrower, ADB, and other development partners \nto participate in meetings to discuss program implementation issues. \n \n74.  Development partner focus. In addition to engaging in broad policy dialogue and \nmonitoring, development partners have provided and will continue to provide support for specific \nareas of the policy matrix. ADB support has focused on SOE policy, the budget's medium-term \nexpenditure framework, power sector reform, legislative reform to reduce the cost of doing \nbusiness, and next steps in social protection. In the context of the policy matrix, AusAID and \nNZAID have been most prominent in the immediate response to the tsunami and follow-on \nalleviation of social impacts. The EU's area of focus has been PFM, while the World Bank has \nfocused on telecommunications reform. \n \n75.  Implementation  period.  The  program  cluster  period  is  from  1  March  2009  to \n30 December 2011. The policy, legislative, organizational, and operational changes agreed to \nwith the government and set out in the policy matrix will be put in place during this period. \nSubprogram 1 will be implemented from 1 March 2009 to 30 October 2010. \n \n76.  Procurement and disbursement. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to Samoa \naccording to ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for program \nloans.34 The proceeds will be used to finance items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries, excluding items in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 8) and imports financed by \nother bilateral and multilateral sources. Loan proceeds disbursed against imports will require \ngovernment  certification  that  the  value  of  all  imports  to  Samoa,  minus  its  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance, is at least equal to or greater than the amount of the loan to be disbursed during a \nparticular year. \n \n77.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs. Supporting \nimport documentation will not be required if, during each year that loan proceeds are expected \nto  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Samoa  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during that year. The government will \ncertify its compliance with this formula with the withdrawal request. \n \n78.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  of  economy  and  efficiency,  in  compliance  with  the \n                                                 \n34\n  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. ", "  21\ngovernment\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  international  commodity  markets  will  be \nprocured according to procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. Before \nwithdrawal, the government will open or nominate a deposit account with the Central Bank of \nSamoa to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated \naccording to terms satisfactory to ADB. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n79.  Tranches. The program will be provided as a cluster loan comprising two subprograms, \neach  a  single  tranche  program.  A  single  tranche  loan  of  $16.0  million  equivalent  will  be \ndisbursed under subprogram 1 when the government has met the conditions for effectiveness. \nSubprogram 2 will be presented for consideration and approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \ndepending on the progress achieved in implementing subprogram 1, including compliance with \nthe proposed policy actions, and the readiness of the government to undertake the succeeding \npolicy reform measures. A single tranche loan of $10.8 million equivalent is expected to be \ndisbursed under subprogram 2. Subprogram 2 is expected to be considered by the Board about \n12 months after the subprogram 1 loan takes effect. \n \n80.  Counterpart funds. Local currency generated from the proceeds of the loans will be \nused to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n \n81.  Program performance monitoring and evaluation. MOF will (i) establish within 3 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness  and  then  maintain  a  performance  evaluation  system  for  the \nprogram, which will be derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and \npolicy matrix, and (ii) monitor and report to ADB, every 6 months during the term of the program, \nthe implementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes and public enterprise \nperformance (including financial and performance indicators), in line with the program impact \nand outcome indicators agreed on with the government. As the outcomes and impact of the \nprogram will be felt most clearly beyond the period of its implementation, they will continue to be \nmonitored by MOF. The monitoring of outcomes and impact will be useful to the government\u2019s \nown processes and decision making and, hence, is not an onerous requirement. \n \n82.  Program review. In cooperation with the government and in conjunction with reviews \nmade under associated TA, ADB will periodically review the progress of implementation and \nassess the impact of the ERSP. The government will keep ADB informed of the outcome of \npolicy proposals and policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have \nimplications for ERSP implementation and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on \nany  resulting  policy  proposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  MOF  and  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral agencies, will review program performance 6 months after loan effectiveness to review \nthe outcome of subprogram 1 and begin preparing subprogram 2. This review will (i) evaluate \nthe implementation of the policy reform under subprogram 1; (ii) assess the impact on each \nsector; (iii) describe lessons identified during the program period; and (iv) outline reforms and \nassistance needed for sustained economic recovery, to enable the processing of subprogram 2. \n \n83.  The government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators for \nmonitoring ERSP implementation and evaluating its impact in the ERSP design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). \n \n84.  A program completion report will be prepared for each subprogram, with an overall \nreport to be prepared within 1 year following the end of the program to evaluate its overall \n ", "22  \nsuccess. The government will continue to monitor and evaluate the program at least until the \nprogram completion report is prepared. \n \n85.  Anticorruption Policy.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the executing agency. Consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are made applicable during Program implementation including by requiring \nthe Borrower to facilitate the exercise of ADB's right to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the program. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n86.  The ADB\u2013World Bank Samoa country focal officer\u2014appointed in October 2009, funded \nby the World Bank, and located in the joint ADB\u2013World Bank country focal office\u2014will provide \nan immediate point of contact for the program and provide technical support as required. \n \n87.  The TA on Pacific Economic Management supports economic monitoring, analysis, and \npolicy advice in Pacific developing member countries, including Samoa.35 The TA supports the \nstrengthening of economic monitoring systems and uses this information to provide higher-\nquality economic advice. The TA focuses on assisting the formulation and implementation of \ncountry-specific actions in response to the global economic crisis. The scope of assistance \nextends to revitalizing economic management systems, including support for the implementation \nof communication and awareness-raising initiatives and the formulation and implementation of \nbudget and structural reforms. This will extend assistance on fiscal management provided by \nthe TA on Support for the Formulation and Implementation of the SDS, 2008\u20132012.36 \n \n88.  Under the TA for the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, ADB supports Pacific \ndeveloping  member  countries,  including  Samoa,  in  coordinating  private  sector  reforms; \nanalyzing  private  sector  development-related  issues  and  projects;  reforming  companies, \ncompanies registry, and bankruptcy legislation; secured transactions initiatives; and actions to \nimprove governance and restructure the SOE sector (footnote 28). Substantial TA has been \nprovided previously to Samoa for the implementation of the Public Bodies (Performance and \nAccountability)  Act  2001,  including  the  preparation  of  regulations  and  road  maps  for  SOE \nrestructuring.  The  TA  is  expected  to  continue  this  support,  with  an  emphasis  on  SOEs. \nCompetition  policy  and  legislative  reform  that  reduces  the  cost  of  doing  business  will  be \nsupported. \n \n89.  ADB  is  supporting  reform  in  the  electricity  sector  through  TA  for  Implementing  the \nSamoa National Energy Policy, which is linked to a large power sector expansion project and a \nregional energy efficiency project (footnote 27). \n \n90.

In \naddition, ADB supports the development of internal audit in the Pacific in conjunction with the \nIMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, initially in three pilot countries including \nSamoa.39 \n \n91.  Other  development  partners  are  providing  substantial  TA  in support  of  other  policy \nactions covered by the ERSP (Appendix 9). Notably, the World Bank has been a key source of \nsupport for telecommunications reform and the privatization of SamoaTel. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impact \n \n92.  Economic.  The  program  will  provide  budget  support  to  enable  the  government  to \nstimulate the economy and thereby respond to the economic downturn caused by the global \neconomic crisis. It will then support the recovery of the economy and the transition to faster and \nmore inclusive economic growth. Investment in priority infrastructure projects will deliver the \nhigher-quality and lower-cost services needed for economic growth and provide opportunities \nfor local businesses to participate in service delivery. \n \n93.  Social. The program will help the government reduce the incidence of poverty and \nreturn the economy to its long-term growth path. An analysis of social and gender issues is in \nAppendix 7. Benefits will be accrued in the short term by mitigating the negative effects of the \nglobal economic crisis and, in the medium-to-long term, by implementing SOE reforms, which \nare expected to improve services. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 10. \n \n94.  Environmental. Environmental benefits will arise from the implementation of the PSIP in \nthe medium term, as it will allow the government to optimize the contribution of infrastructure to \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. The reformulated PSIP and post-tsunami reconstruction will \nreflect close attention to reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities to storms and other \nnatural disasters, the incidence of which is expected to rise with climate change. SOE reforms \nwill support more efficient and less wasteful resource use. An environmental assessment is in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n95.  Financial. The program will encourage improved fiscal management and budgeting \nfocused on priority expenditures. The progressive reform of SOEs and clarification of CSOs will \nremove  unnecessary  costs  from  the  government  budget.  Improved  cost  efficiency  in  the \nprovision  of  SOE  services  will  lend  fiscal  space  for  the  government\u2019s  other  social  and \ndevelopment spending.  \n                                                 \n37\n ADB supports the operation of the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre through ADB. 2008.

Technical Assistance for Strengthening Public Financial Management in \nPacific Developing Member Countries. Manila (TA 6507-REG). The Cook Islands, Samoa, and Tonga are the three \npilot countries. \n ", "24  \n \nB.  Risks \n \n96.  The key risks are (i) insufficient capacity in the government to implement the program, \n(ii) reduced  funding  for  capital  expenditure  because  of  a  lack  of  restraint  in  government \nagencies regarding growth in current expenditures, (iii) impaired implementation of the medium-\nterm fiscal framework because of a shortfall in external financing, and (iv) insufficient political \nand community support for the policy actions. \n \n97.  The program is designed to mitigate key risks. Explicit cabinet commitments will drive \nthe allocation of financial and human resources to implementing the program and ensure that \nthe budget is able to fund higher capital expenditure. Technical assistance will be available to \nimplement important structural and governance policy actions and to support the budget and \nplanning process. The program has been developed in close consultation with development \npartners to ensure a shared commitment to supporting the government's policy agenda and the \npreparedness of Samoa to secure external concessional financing. Community awareness and \ndemand  for  the  program  will  be  reinforced  through  the  communications  and  engagement \nstrategy. The cluster approach will allow the deferral or reformulation of subprogram 2 if the \npace of implementation or political commitment changes. \n \n98.  Full achievement of the program impact relies on (i) improvement in the global economy, \n(ii) a positive response from the private sector to improved economic conditions, (iii) continuing \nimprovements in the performance orientation of government agencies, and (iv) the provision of \ncomplementary technical resources by development partners. \n \n99.  The  potential  benefits  from  reducing  the  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis  and \nproviding for post-tsunami reconstruction with supporting structural and governance initiatives \nare considered to outweigh the risks. Indeed, the costs of inaction could be substantial. They \nwould be reflected in a continued decline in the fiscal situation, with resultant damage to the \noperations of the private sector and implications for the government\u2019s ability to fund basic social \nservices such as health and education and address environmental concerns. \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n100.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The government will (a) ensure that the policies already adopted and actions \nalready taken as described in the development policy letter, including the policy \nmatrix, continue in effect for the duration of the program period and subsequently \nand (b) promptly adopt all other policies and take all other actions indicated in the \ndevelopment  policy  letter,  including  the  policy  matrix,  and  ensure  that  such \npolicies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the program period and \nsubsequently. \n(ii)  The government will keep ADB informed of relevant policy proposals and policy \ndiscussions with other multilateral or bilateral development partners that have \nimplications  for  implementation  of  the  program,  keep  ADB  informed  of  the \nprogress made in carrying out the policies and actions set out in the development \npolicy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  and  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to ", "  25\ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. The government will continue policy \ndialogue  with  ADB  on  problems  and  constraints  encountered  during  the \nimplementation  of  the  program  and  on  desirable  changes  to  overcome  or \nmitigate such problems and constraints. \n(iii)  Throughout the implementation of the program, the government will ensure that \nadequate resources are allocated and released in a timely manner in order to \nensure the proper implementation of the ERSP as described in the development \npolicy letter.  \n(iv)  The government will undertake the measures necessary to create and sustain a \ncorruption-free environment; ensure that its anticorruption law and regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are strictly enforced and complied with during \nprogram implementation; and facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise of its right to investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive practices relating to the program.  \n(v)  The government will ensure that (a) within 3 months of loan effectiveness a \nperformance  evaluation  system,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  established  and \nmaintained  and  (b)  the  Ministry  of  Finance  monitors  and  reports  to  ADB, \nbiannually over the term of the program, the implementation of policy actions and \ntheir impact on budget outcomes and public enterprise performance (including \nfinancial and performance indicators), as aligned with the program impact and \noutcome indicators agreed upon with the government. \n(vi)  The government will ensure that (a) its monitoring and evaluation of the program \nremains in effect for at least 1 year after the completion of the program and, \n(b) within 1 year of program completion, it will prepare a program completion \nreport for the purposes of evaluating the program\u2019s overall success. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n101.  The loan will become effective only after the government has satisfactorily fulfilled all \nconditions for the release of the single tranche of subprogram 1. \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n102.

Samoa's Economic Vulnerability \n1.  Samoa\u2019s  natural  resource  endowment  supports  agriculture,  fishery,  and  tourism \ndevelopment, but it faces constraints imposed by a small domestic market and high shipping \ncosts.1 Other constraints to private sector development emanate from weaknesses in the legal \nand regulatory environment within which business operates, inefficiencies in the state-owned \nenterprise (SOE) sector, and weaknesses in physical infrastructure. Badly needed reforms of \nSOEs have been slow and have yet to be completed. \n \n2.  The result is an economy that is narrowly based and highly dependent, on imports, with \nmerchandise imports 10 times greater than merchandise exports. The balance of payments \nrelies heavily on the continued inflow of private remittances, official grants, and international \ntourism receipts. This exposes Samoa to the effects of economic downturns in its major trading \npartners\u2014Australia, New Zealand, and the United States\u2014which are also the main sources of \ntourist arrivals and remittances. The exposure was highlighted by the impacts of the global \neconomic crisis, which contributed to a 5.5% contraction in the real economy in FY2009. In \naddition, Samoa is highly exposed to adverse weather, natural disasters, and crop disease.  \n \n3.  Samoa's economic vulnerability was demonstrated by the need to rebuild the Samoan \neconomy  after  two  major  cyclones  in  the  early  1990s  that  saw  the  ratio  of  government \nexpenditure to the gross domestic product (GDP) peak at more than 80% in fiscal year (FY) \n1993. This was followed by the outbreak of taro blight that damaged local food production and \nexports.  More  recently,  in  January  2004,  Samoa  was  hit  by  tropical  cyclone  Heta,  which \nseverely damaged agriculture and caused inflation to rise above 16% during the year. The \ndamage  caused  by  the  earthquake  and  cyclone  in  September  2009  further  demonstrates \nSamoa's exposure to factors beyond its control.  \n \n4.  Yet  Samoa  has  overcome  these  potential  limitations  and  is  widely  regarded  as  a \n\u201csuccess story of the Pacific.\u201d2 The government began introducing major economic and public \nsector reforms in the early 1990s, in the wake of a series of crippling disasters.3 It has persisted, \nsteadily broadening and deepening reforms to achieve a major economic transformation. On \naverage, real GDP per capita has increased by more than 3% per year snice the mid-1990s, \nand external public debt has fallen below 40% of the GDP. These achievements are enabling \nSamoa  to  graduate  from  the  ranks  of  least-developed  countries  despite  its  economic \nvulnerability.  \n \nB.  Economic Prospects \n5.  The recent shocks occurred against a background of considerable progress in achieving \nsocial and economic development. Thanks to political stability, the country has been able to \nimplement far-reaching and important reforms. Despite the inherent constraints imposed by \nSamoa\u2019s size and location, it has identified and realized opportunities for sustained growth. \nFurther advancement can be attained through measures to advance the role of the private \nsector in the economy. Agriculture and tourism can be vibrant sources of employment and \n                                                 \n1  This appendix draws on ADB. 2009.

Washington D.C. \n3  For  example,  a  value-added  tax  was  introduced  in  1994,  structural  reforms  were  introduced  to  promote \ncompetition  and  private  sector  development,  several  SOEs  were  privatized,  and  institutional  reforms  were \nimplemented progressively across the public service. \n ", "Appendix 3  37\ngrowth, but this requires further efforts to develop an appropriate enabling environment for \ninvestment in these sectors, equitable and efficient economic policies, and continued reductions \nin government involvement in commerce, particularly in agriculture. \n \n6.  However, substantial constraints exist on private sector development and effective public \nservice delivery. These stem from (i) physical infrastructure deficiencies, particularly in power, \ntransport, drainage, and sanitation; (ii) the broad engagement of the state in the economy, \ncrowding out the private sector and in many areas providing only weak public goods; (iii) \nunderdeveloped  financial  markets;  and  (iv)  weaknesses  in  the  private  sector-enabling \nenvironment. Further, capacity and institutional weaknesses constrain sustainable development. \n \n7.  Removing  these  binding  constraints  would  facilitate  sustainable  and  broad-based \neconomic growth that would generate employment and resources for public services, which are \nrequired to enable inclusive development and growth and alleviate poverty and hardship. To \nrealize its potential growth prospects, Samoa must face the fundamental development challenge \nof generating private sector-led growth in output and employment and thereby raise living \nstandards and reduce hardship. \n \n8.  Samoa has demonstrated its capacity to meet these challenges by being one of the \nleaders in policy reform in the Pacific. The environment for doing business in Samoa has \nimproved  consistently  since  the  mid-1990s.  Macroeconomic  and  fiscal  stability,  liberalized \nfinancial  markets,  public  service  reforms,  reduced  government  presence  in  commerce, \nimproved infrastructure, and increased liberalization of the telecommunications and aviation \nmarkets have significantly improved the business environment. This has been manifested in the \nfastest  sustained  growth  in  the  region  and  a  sharp  improvement  in  Samoa\u2019s  human \ndevelopment indicators. However, despite substantial policy improvements, much remains to be \ndone to overcome natural and artificial impediments and achieve sustainable economic growth. \n \nC.  Constraints and Key Issues \n \n1.  The Role of the State in the Economy \n \n9.  The public sector still accounts for a substantial portion of overall expenditure in Samoa, \nwith  government  spending  equivalent  to  40%  of  the  GDP.  The  state  continues  to  play  a \nsubstantial role in the Samoan economy through SOEs, which include a range of commercial \nbusinesses that employ 10% of the workforce. The  supplies most infrastructure services, plays \na  substantial  role  in  agriculture,  and  runs  a  number  of  businesses.  Financial  returns  are \ngenerally low or negative. \n \n10.  Further,  in  some  sectors,  particularly  electricity  generation,  legally  implemented \nmonopolies raise costs and reduce productivity. More generally, the high cost and poor quality \nof public services that are provided either directly by the state or by public enterprises present \nobstacles to private sector development. Electricity costs are among the highest in the Pacific, \nreflecting the rising cost of fuel, inefficient tariff structure, and management shortfalls in the \nstate-owned monopoly. Moreover, unreliable power provision is a standard complaint of the \nbusiness  community.  While  treated  water  charges  are  comparatively  low,  service  remains \nerratic.  \n \n11.  These  costs  depress  the  competitiveness  of  export  industries,  while  the  capacity \nconstraints of state-owned utilities restrain investment growth in productive sectors. Operation \nand maintenance of infrastructure present much greater scope for private sector involvement. \n ", "38   Appendix 3 \nFurther, the government\u2019s continued acceptance of noncommercial stewardship of large parts of \nthe public enterprise portfolio, particularly the public trading bodies, crowds out the private \nsector and exposes the government to significant risk and direct costs. \n \n12.  Compared with the past, however, there has been a strong downward trend in the \nstate\u2019s involvement in the economy. If the intentions of the government with respect to future \npolicy are carried out, public sector expenditure will continue to decline and competition will \ngradually be introduced through contracting out. Although the government\u2019s intention is to retain \n100% ownership of the major infrastructure SOEs, policy is to be directed toward allowing \nprivate sector participation in partnership with these SOEs.7 \n \n13.  The benefits of lessening the engagement of the state in business have been shown in \nthe returns from reforming telecommunications and transport, in which Samoa has been one of \nthe  leaders  in  the  region.  The  sale  of  the  international  routes  of  Polynesian  Airlines  was \ncompleted in October 2004, and the benefits from these reforms continue to flow through to the \ntourism sector. Efforts to open the economy have also arisen from the arrival of Digicel, having \na dramatic impact on the cost of telecommunications. The sale of the international routes of \nPolynesian Airlines lowered the cost of air travel to Samoa overnight, and the number of tourists \nhas increased dramatically. Privatization is continuing, with Samoa Broadcasting Corporation \nalready privatized and SamoaTel scheduled for privatization in 2010.  \n \n2.  Economic Infrastructure \n \n14.  The provision of adequate economic infrastructure services is crucial to the creation of \nan attractive investment climate. The issues are demonstrated by the situation in the power \nsector.  Blackouts,  brownouts,  high  tariffs,  and  the  weak  finances  of  the  Electric  Power \nCorporation are problems that need to be addressed. A long-term program for reforming the \nelectricity  sector  is  needed  that  encompasses  tariff  adjustment  and  structure,  institutional \nstrengthening of the Electric Power Corporation, opening up power generation to private sector \ncompetition in a new regulatory framework, and a review of the customary service obligations \nthat the Electric Power Corporation has to meet that addresses costing and reimbursement \nmechanisms. The government should make it a priority to pass the electricity bill, which sets up \nan independent regulator. This would be an important step in improving the performance of the \nElectric Power Corporation. \n \n3.  Property Rights and Land Issues \n \n15.  About 80% of the land in Samoa is under customary ownership, 16% is owned by the \ngovernment, and 4% is freehold. Tackling the problems of a customary system is difficult and \nhighly sensitive. Land issues lie at the core of the Samoan way of life, and it is unsurprising that \nthe government has moved cautiously in addressing them. The current system of customary \ntenure has, however, a strong and deleterious impact on investment. Nevertheless, discussion \nof land issues is moving forward toward a system that will allow those wishing to lease their land \nto identify themselves to the government, who will keep a database for investors. In doing this, it \nis important that lease arrangements allow the lessors to benefit if businesses located on their \nland are successful, perhaps through royalty payments. A further impetus for reform is that \nanomalies exist that appear to have little bearing on the foundations of the customary land \nsystem. For example, leases for agriculture are not available for Samoans without title but are \n                                                 \n7   The Samoa Water Authority, Electric Power Corporation, Samoa Port Authority, Samoa Airport Authority, and \nSamoa Shipping Corporation. The soon-to-be-formed Samoa Land Transport Authority is expected to have \n\u201cstrategic\u201d status, but SamoaTel is open to privatization. \n ", "Appendix 3  39\npermitted for companies and foreigners. This penalizes Samoans and holds back land leasing in \ngeneral and agriculture in particular. \n \n  4.  Financial Markets \n \n16.  Financial markets in Samoa are still underdeveloped. Weak property rights, the lack of a \ncollateral  framework,  difficulty  in  collecting  debts,  and  poor  credit  information  hamper  the \nfunding of investment and entrepreneurship. However, work on a new framework for secured \ntransactions has begun with ADB support. The legal framework for lending and debt collection is \nin the process of being modernized with the drafting of a Personal Property Securities Act and \naccompanying regulations. The act will allow the pledging of movable property as security for \nlending by companies and individuals and simplify and speed up the debt collection process. \n \n17.  With a well-functioning collateral framework in place, bank lending will have a stronger \nfoundation and the range of potential clients should increase. The embryonic credit bureau and \nthe debt-collection company are making progress and could provide an additional building block \nfor  developing  the  financial  market.  ADB's  proposed  subordinated  convertible  bonds  and \ntechnical assistance to one of the commercial banks in Samoa is designed to increase access \nto finance and strengthen the emerging banking sector, including corporate governance. \n \n5.  The Commercial Legal Framework \n \n18.  From a business law standpoint, Samoa\u2019s commercial legal framework is a mixture of \nantiquated  legislation  (some  dating  back  to  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century)  and  new \nlegislation that reflects modern business law. Samoa has embarked on a number of initiatives to \nmodernize its commercial legal framework, most notably with the passage of the Companies Act \n2001, subsequently revised in the Companies Amendment Act 2006 and the drafting of its \nimplementing regulations. This act is modeled on its New Zealand counterpart and reflects \nmodern  business  practices.  While  the  promulgation  of  the  act  was  delayed  for  lack  of \nimplementing regulations\u2014in large part because of delays in deciding how the companies \nregistry would handle electronic registration and paperless filing\u2014implementation commenced \nin 2008. This was assisted by work commenced in late 2007, with ADB support, on modernizing \nthe  companies\u2019  registry,  along  with  the  secured  transactions  framework.  There  would  be \nefficiency gains from an amalgamation under a single administrative agency of the company \nand  the  movable  property  registries,  as  well  as  the  motor  vehicle  registry  (which  records \nsecurity interests in motor vehicles). \n  \n19.  Samoa\u2019s bankruptcy act is based on the United Kingdom bankruptcy act of 1906 and is \nextremely outdated, mandating a bankruptcy process that is costly to undergo. Other laws \ngoverning commercial transactions, including arbitration, the sales law, consumer protection, \nand credit information, need updating and amendment. \n \n20.  Foreign  direct  investment  in  Samoa  is  the  second  lowest  of  all  Pacific  developing \nmember countries, ahead of only the Fiji Islands and amounting to less than 4% of the GDP. \nForeign investors face far more onerous requirements to obtain permission to invest than do \ndomestic investors. Under the Foreign Investment Act 2000, foreign investors must apply for a \nforeign  investment  certificate  from  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  Industry  and  Labour  before \nproceeding to Inland Revenue for a business license and then return to Commerce Industry and \nLabour  to register a company name. The act provides free repatriation of profits and capital \ngains (given tax clearance and supporting documentation), eliminates the general requirement \nfor partnership with local investors, and shortens the list of activities reserved for Samoan \n ", "40   Appendix 3 \nnationals to bus and taxi transport, hire vehicles, retail trade, and sawmilling. A restricted list of \nactivities is open to foreign investors provided they enter into joint ventures with Samoans, \nemploy locals, and source capital overseas. Reporting requirements, the difficulty of getting \npermission for the employment of expatriate workers, weaknesses in the Foreign Investment \nAct  2000,  and  lengthy  delays  in  obtaining  land  leases  all  contribute  to  low  foreign  direct \ninvestment. Further, the ad hoc nature of incentives offered to foreign investors\u2019 risk distorting \ninvestment and resource allocation. Potential foreign investors continue to face uncertainty \nabout the restricted list, since its content\u2014along with the criteria for inclusion of a business \nactivity in the reserved and restricted lists\u2014have been under review for some time. The revision \nof  the  Foreign  Investment  Act  2000  and  the  urgent  simplification  of  conditions  for  the \nemployment of expatriates are essential steps toward making Samoa more attractive to foreign \ninvestors. Refinements to the act are almost ready for tabling in Parliament. \n \n6.  The Special Needs of Agriculture \n \n21.  The government has stressed that agriculture is a private sector activity and that its role \nin the sector is to provide a rural business environment that is conducive to private participation. \nSamoa is blessed with fertile soil, a climate that allows year-round growing, and a geographical \nposition that potentially allows supplying both the northern and the southern hemisphere during \ntheir respective winters. In spite of the strong potential for niche market agriculture, however, \nsubsistence farming still accounts for nearly half of agricultural output. Agriculture is largely a \npart-time activity, as only 6% of households are occupied full time in agriculture and only 23% \nearn half their income from farming. \n \n22.  Samoan agriculture underperforms because only a small portion of arable land is farmed \nand productivity is low. The failure of this sector to develop more rapidly is the result of a \nnumber of interconnected factors, including continued heavy state involvement in agriculture, \nlack of information and expertise on markets and standards, failure to exploit market niches, and \nthe difficulty of leasing land for agriculture.  \n \n23.  Realizing the potential of the agricultural sector requires improved agricultural extension \nservices; better market information; and the ability to deal with the phytosanitary standards of \ncountries to which Samoa can export agricultural crops, especially Australia and New Zealand. \n \n7.  Promoting Public\u2013Private Sector Dialogue \n \n24.  Discussion  with  both  the  private  and  the  public  sector  revealed  that  institutional \nmemories are short and that there is no ongoing formal process for dialogue on important \nissues. The government should give the private sector a more central role in policy formulation, \nwith a view to enhancing the understanding of business needs and incentive systems, and \nfacilitating  public\u2013private  partnership.  Toward  this  end,  a  private\u2013public  sector  roundtable, \nfacilitated by ADB in 2007, led to agreement on establishing a formal process for public\u2013private \ndialogue through an amended Revenue Board mechanism. \n \n25.  Recently, the Chamber of Commerce became the umbrella organization for the formerly \ndisparate representation of the many private sector bodies in Samoa. However, its lack of a \nsecretariat hampers its ability to effectively represent the private sector in Samoa, in particular in \nproviding input for the Samoa Development Strategy, 2008\u20132012 and liaising with the regional \numbrella group, the Pacific Private Sector Organization. It now has a full time fully funded \nsecretariat and a separate Samoa private sector organization has been set up. \n ", "Appendix 4  41 \nFISCAL ANALYSIS \nA.  The Overall Fiscal Stance \n1.  Samoa has sustained a sound overall fiscal stance. Budget surpluses were achieved in \nfiscal year (FY) 2005 and in the late 1990s. When budget deficits have occurred they have been \nkept small to moderate.1 The last budget deficits of concern were in the early and mid-1990s \nwhen the combined effects of cyclone damage, taro disease, and the restructuring of the \nnational airline saw the deficit peak at more than 20% of the gross domestic product (GDP). The \ngovernment\u2019s subsequent sound fiscal stance has more than halved its external debt since \nFY1995. The ratio of government external debt to GDP is projected to reach a moderate level \nbelow 40%.2 The sound fiscal stance has resulted from wide-ranging revenue reforms, tighter \nexpenditure management, and good economic growth.  \n \n2.  However, Samoa faces a number of risks to the maintenance of a sound fiscal situation. \nThese are the inherent vulnerability of a small, open economy; continued oil price increases; the \npotential emigration of skilled workers; susceptibility to natural disasters; and market isolation. \nThe features that support continued healthy fiscal outcomes are political stability, relatively \nstable economic performance, and ongoing economic and institutional reforms. Public financial \nmanagement continues to improve, and taxation compliance has been strengthened. Samoa \nhas made substantial progress in improving fiscal transparency, as there is a comprehensive \nand modern legal framework for fiscal management, the central bank is effectively independent, \nthe budget is comprehensive and reliable, public accounts are timely and comprehensive, and \nthere is quite extensive reporting of noncash items. \n \n3.  A commitment to prudent fiscal management has been a feature of recent national \ndevelopment plans, and there has been remarkable success in meeting these commitments. \nFor some time, the medium-term fiscal goal of the government has been to maintain balanced \nbudgets. If budget deficits occur, the goal is to keep them below a target rate of 3.5% of GDP \nand ensure they support valid capital expenditure.3 These targets were adopted by the Strategy \nfor the Development of Samoa (SDS), 2008\u20132012.  \n \n4.  The government has achieved its goal of balanced budgets in most recent years, though \nbudget deficits increased slightly from FY2004 to FY2008 toward the government\u2019s threshold of \n3.5%. However, the deficits have since risen slight above the target, indicating some relaxation \nof aggregate fiscal discipline (Table A4). \n \nB.  The Quality of the Revenue System \n5.  Revenue generation is generally aligned with national poverty reduction priorities. Taxes \nare generally equitable with the lifting of the tax-free threshold and exemption of fresh food from \nthe value-added goods and services tax (VAGST). In the FY2007 budget, the VAGST was \nincreased to 15% and the threshold at which businesses are required to register for and pay the \nVAGST was increased to ST78,000 per annum. The top personal tax rate and the company tax \nrate were reduced from 29% to 27%, and for individual taxpayers the tax-free threshold was \nraised to ST12,000. \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2009.

Major tariff reforms were undertaken in the FY1999 and FY2000 budgets. In April 2007, \nthe Subcommittee on Tariffs recommended removing tariffs from a range of business inputs. \nThese recommendations were consistent with the SDS goal to remove anomalies from the tariff \nsystem. \n \n7.  A range of anomalies in the enabling environment for investment and private sector \ndevelopment also require removal. However, some anomalies remain in the taxation system, \nsuch as the tax-free status of agriculture. Apart from agriculture, exemptions and incentives are \navailable for tourism and hotel investors, taxpayers who donated to the 2007 South Pacific \n ", "Appendix 4  43 \nGames, business taxpayers in relation to accelerated depreciation allowances, and financial \nservice providers. The Ministry for Revenue estimates that revenues of ST56 million were \nforegone in FY2006 through import duty concessions alone. These various exemptions and \nincentives should urgently be reviewed to ascertain if they are efficient means of generating \nsustainable increases in national income, employment, and other economic benefits. \n \nC.  The Quality of Public Expenditure \n \n8.  The public finance management (PFM) system is robust, and its economic reporting is of \na high order. The key missing factor is the lack of forward estimates of recurrent revenues and \nexpenditures. Some delays occur in submitting audited public accounts to the Office of the Chief \nController and Chief Auditor, while the current format of accounts does not include disclosure of \ndevelopment spending by donors outside of the treasury fund. The environment for monitoring \nrevenues,  expenditures,  and  cash  management  is  incomplete.  These  matters  are  being \naddressed, but progress is constrained by institutional capacity. \n \n9.  The Public Finance Management Act 2001 is the key legislation relating to budget \npreparation  and  execution.  There  is  provision  in  the  act,  and  a  long-standing  government \ncommitment,  for  preparing  and  presenting  the  budget  in  a  multiyear  framework.  The \ndevelopment of a system of forward estimates commenced in November 2006, but progress is \nimpeded by the lack of a practical framework that fits local needs and circumstances. The \ngovernment and its development partners should continue efforts to formulate and implement a \nmedium-term approach to budgeting. \n \n10.  Following an independent assessment of the government\u2019s PFM systems in October \n2006, the Ministry of Finance developed a PFM reform plan. Under the first stage of this plan, it \nwas agreed to focus on achieving basic fiscal discipline and strengthening core systems for \neffective  financial  management.  The  independent  assessment  identified  a  number  of  core \nprocesses that need to be strengthened: \n(i)  the timely preparation and submission of public accounts; \n(ii)  regular  reconciliation  of  bank  accounts  and  cash-flow  management  and \nmonitoring to ensure the predictability of funds for commitment of expenditure; \n(iii)  the monitoring, management, and timely payment of arrears, especially VAGST \nrefunds; \n(iv)  a framework of improved internal control for PFM supported by regular internal \naudit of financial systems and risk analysis; \n(v)  developing  user-friendly  manuals  on  procedures  for  public  accounting  and \nbudgeting at a division level and for the Treasury; \n(vi)  the collection of income tax payments and follow up of income tax arrears; and \n(vii)  strengthening  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  and  transitioning  to \nsector-wide programs, along with improved monitoring of performance with key \nindicators. \n \n11.  Due to the backlog of bank reconciliations, the Ministry of Finance has been unable to \nsubmit  annual  public  accounts  within  the  timeframe  defined  under  the  Public  Finance \nManagement  Act.  In  addition,  it  was  noted  that  inadequate  cash-flow  monitoring  and \nmanagement cause late payment of government accounts, with negative impacts on the private \nsector. Developing an effective internal audit framework that will aim to undertake systems \nmonitoring instead of spot checks is directly related to achieving improvements in reconciling \nand finalizing accounts, as it will help to strengthen existing systems. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 4 \n12.  Despite improvements, the high cost and poor quality of infrastructure that is provided \neither directly by the state or by state-owned enterprises have been obstacles to growth and \ndevelopment in the private sector. Further, the government's continued subsidies to state-\nowned enterprises though its acceptance of noncommercial rates of return crowds out the \nprivate sector and dulls the incentive to achieve efficiency. The success in bringing down \ntelecom costs shows the benefits that can be expected from the private provision of services in \nwide areas of the economy. \n \nD.  Near-Term Priorities \n \n13.  The FY2010 budget provides for a large increase in expenditure to boost GDP, maintain \nessential service delivery, and build the economy for the longer term. A larger capital allocation \nis planned to boost infrastructure spending in road projects, buildings, and school property and \nprovide the necessary stimulus to much-needed productive investment to stimulate economic \nactivity and raise the country\u2019s capital stock. Greater scrutiny has gone into public sector base \nspending to ensure the government gets value for the money it currently spends, as well as find \nefficiencies and savings where possible. Revenue flows are expected to benefit from limiting the \neconomic contraction. \n \n14.  The tsunami presents an additional challenge that will see a deterioration in the fiscal \nposition over the medium term. A revised medium-term expenditure framework is needed for \nFY2010  that  will  allow  the  government  to  meet  higher  near-term  expenditure  needs.  The \nimplementation of the sound, updated Public Sector Investment Program has the potential to \nhelp turn the economy around by countering the cyclical downturn and adverse impact of the \ntsunami and then build for economic recovery by lifting the economy's productive capacity. \nThere  is  a  need,  however,  to  carefully  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  Public  Sector \nInvestment Program to ensure alignment with SDS priorities. \n \n15.  The government needs to strike a balance between the stimulus required to correct for \nthese shocks and sustainability. Operating expenditures will need to be contained to enable the \nfunding of priority capital expenditure. Expenditure on lower-priorities will need to be trimmed.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  45\nPUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \nA.  Public Financial Management \n \n1.  The continued improvement of public financial management is one of the strategies \noutlined in the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS), 2008\u20132012 to support enhanced \npublic sector efficiency.1 The general robustness of the public finance management system was \ndocumented by the International Monetary Fund in 2005 and in the 2006 European Union-\nfunded assessment using the comprehensive public expenditure and financial accountability \n(PEFA)  framework.2  All  government  revenue  and  expenditure  is  incorporated  into  the \ngovernment accounts and the total fiscal risk posed by state-owned enterprises is documented.  \n \n2.  The governance assessment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has identified the \nmain problems emerging in recent years as those relating to the internal control framework, \nliability management, cash management, reconciliation, and reporting. Major weaknesses that \nthe government aims to rectify include (i) a weak linkage between the SDS and annual budgets, \n(ii)  delays  in  presenting  audited  public  accounts,  and  (iii)  some  data  deficiencies  and  an \nassociated lack of coding of government finance statistics headings in the budgetary system. \n \n3.  The Public Finance Management Act 2001 requires the presentation of the budget in a \nmultiyear  framework  with  forward  estimates  for  3  years.  However,  forward  estimates  of \nrecurrent revenues and expenditures are lacking. The government is taking steps to develop a \nmedium-term fiscal framework by fiscal year (FY) 2009 and receives assistance from the Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre for this purpose. Audited public accounts for FY2007 are \navailable, and the accounts for FY2008 are being processed. The lag in preparing audited \naccounts is largely attributed to delays in submissions from line ministries to the Ministry of \nFinance, the changeover to a new financial system, and limited capacity in the auditor general\u2019s \noffice, with most audits on public bodies outsourced to the private sector.  \n \n4.  The quality of public finance data is compromised by misclassification of accounts, \nparticularly for net lending, external grants, and current and development expenditure, and \nbecause the budgetary system is not coded by government financial statistics headings. The \ngovernment intends to move to the 2001 government financial statistics system (on a cash \nbasis)  over  the  next  2  years,  with  assistance  from  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance \nCentre, and made initial steps in the FY2009 budget by preparing summary reconciliations to \nthe government financial statistics.  \n \n5.  Samoa's contracting and procurement rules are clear and generally well implemented. \nWhile there is no independent legal framework regulating policies on procurement, instruments \nsuch as the Public Finance Management Act 2001 provide legal coverage. Revised tender \nboard guidelines have been finalized. \n \n6.  Samoa has established effective rules and processes to guard against corruption. The \nongoing challenge is to ensure they are effectively implemented and monitored, given the \noverwhelming political dominance of the governing party combined with pressure to contribute \nto cultural functions that could lead to the use or misuse of public resources and entrusted \npower. Samoa has endorsed and actively engaged with the ADB\u2013Organization for Economic \nCo-operation and Development Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific action and \n                                                 \n1  The sector diagnostics presented in this appendix draw heavily on ADB. 2009.

Brussels (October 2006). \n ", "46   Appendix 5 \nimplementation plans and has completed self-assessments of corruption. However, it has yet to \nestablish a specialist anticorruption agency or unit charged with responsibility for coordinating \nefforts to prevent and eliminate corruption.  \n \n7.  Samoa\u2019s  public  finance  management3  has  recently  been  assessed  using  the \ncomprehensive PEFA framework (footnote 2).4 That analysis has provided a firm basis for \nSamoa\u2019s first assessment of governance risks and mitigation strategies. Compared with other \nPacific  developing  member  countries,  Samoa  ranks  well  in  terms  of  its  public  finance \nmanagement. The budgeting system tends to be realistic in terms of aggregate projections and \noutcomes,5 budget documents capture virtually all revenues and expenditures, and the quality \nof economic reporting is high. The budget process is policy based and actively engages all \nrelevant  stakeholders.  Oversight  of  the  budget  and  fiscal  risk  is  effective.6  The  budget  is \nimplemented in an orderly and predictable manner, and there are significant controls placed on \nthe release of public funds. \n \n8.  At  the  same  time,  there  are  areas  in  which  Samoa\u2019s  public  financial  management \nperformance remains less than optimal. Further, there has been considerable staff turnover in \nrecent  years,  and  the  consequent  decline  in  professional  capacity  is  becoming  visible  in \nweakening performance in some areas of public service. Adding to these emerging concerns, \npressure was placed on Samoa\u2019s fiscal position in FY2006 by the granting of a 42% public \nservice wage increase over 3 years and the costs of restructuring Polynesian Airlines for the \njoint venture agreement with Virgin Blue Airlines.7 Authorities tightened their fiscal stance after \nthe March 2006 election, in the end limiting the FY2006 deficit to 0.3% of the gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), much lower than had been targeted. \n \n9.  In terms of ongoing or emerging risks, of key concern are the problems that have \nemerged  in  recent  years  in  the  internal  control  framework,  liability  management,  cash \nmanagement,  reconciliation,  and  financial  reporting.  The  internal  control  framework  has \nexcessive  transaction  level  controls,  yet  monitoring  of  income,  expenditure,  and  cash \nmanagement is inadequate. There is inadequate monitoring of accounts payable, which are not \nalways paid in a timely manner. There are also deficiencies in tax collection, especially in \nrelation to gross income tax arrears. The PEFA report points out that this can have some \nsignificant  impacts.  The  accumulation  of  tax  arrears  can  be  a  critical  factor  undermining \nbudgetary outturns, while the ability to collect tax debt lends credibility to the tax assessment \nprocess and reflects equal treatment for all taxpayers. In Samoa, the current lack of confidence \nin the integrity of revenue and expenditure data means many agencies run their own separate \naccounting systems, which are not always compatible with the central Finance One system. \nFinally, since early-2009 audited public accounts have not been submitted on time (although \nprior  to  this  they  were  always  timely),  a  problem  attributed  to  the  introduction  of  a  new \ninformation system and to the staff turnover.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Public finance management in Samoa is governed by the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act \n2001. \n4  Under the internationally accepted PEFA framework, Samoa\u2019s performance was assessed in relation to seven \ndimensions of public financial management: credibility of the budget; comprehensiveness and transparency; \ndegree to which the budget is prepared with due regard to government policy; predictability and control in budget \nexecution; accounting, recording, and reporting; external scrutiny and audit operations; and appropriateness of \ndonor practices in the country. The analysis covered all government expenditure for the 3 years to 30 June 2006. \n5  Despite a tendency each year to allocate insufficient funds to health and education and then transfer the needed \nfunds from other ministries in supplementary budgets. \n6  Medium-term estimates have been adopted in the Public Sector Investment Program. \n7  The restructuring costs were estimated as equivalent to 2.5% of the gross domestic product in FY2006. \n ", "  Appendix 5  47\nB.  Procurement \n \n10.  Samoa\u2019s contracting and procurement rules are clear and generally well implemented. \nSamoa  does  not  have  an  independent  legal  framework  regulating  its  policies  on  public \nprocurement. However, as a result of the government\u2019s efforts to improve the procurement \nenvironment in recent years, several other instruments provide legal coverage. For example, \nSamoa\u2019s  Public  Finance  Management  Act  obliges  ministers  to  comply  with  procurement \nprocedures  and  processes,  and  the  tenders  board  is  authorized  to  issue  regulations, \ninstructions, and operating manuals on the procurement of goods, works, and services.8  \n \n11.  Although responsibility for procurement processing has been successfully devolved to \nministries and departments, the associated approval thresholds are quite low. For contracts that \nhave a potential value of between ST100,000 and ST500,000, the tenders board determines \nhow contracts will be let. Beyond this amount, a cabinet decision is required. Eighty percent of \npublic contracts in Samoa are awarded on the basis of open competition. Exceptions are \nallowed in cases of repeat purchase and highly specialized goods and services. The various \nprocurement methods included in the tenders board guidelines are largely consistent with ADB \nand World Bank procurement guidelines, with a major focus on competitive bidding and on \ntransparency and integrity in the bidding process.9 In fact, recent development activities actively \nharmonize their procurement processes and reporting systems with  the government\u2019s own \nsystem and regulations.10 \n \n12.  In October 2003, ADB and the World Bank jointly undertook a procurement assessment \nin Samoa.11 This review recommended that the Samoan government revise the tenders board \nguidelines  to  ensure  they  are  comprehensive  and  develop  a  new,  more  user-friendly \nprocurement manual. The review also recommended establishing an effective and independent \nmechanism for handling complaints. A process for submitting and addressing procurement \ncomplaints  is  in  place and  operating,  but  it  lacks  the ability  to  refer  the  resolution  of  the \ncomplaint to a higher external authority. At present, complaints are first referred to the relevant \nagency and, if not satisfactorily resolved there, can be referred to the secretary of the tenders \nboard. \n \nC.  Anticorruption \n \n13.  There is no concrete evidence of widespread and persistent corruption in Samoa. Where \ninstances of corruption are identified (commonly bribery of customs or police officers), they are \naddressed. The government has instituted laws, policies, parliamentary standing orders, and \nguidelines to curb and eliminate corrupt practices. Samoa\u2019s public sector reforms have actively \nsought to incorporate transparency and accountability. Although it is too early to assess the \nimpact  of  these  reforms,  the  many  institutional  strengthening  programs  that  have  been \n                                                 \n8  The Samoa Tenders Board and the Ministry of Finance has issued Guidelines for Government Procurement and \nContracting: Goods and Works as well as Guidelines for Government Procurement and Contracting: Consulting \nServices, in June 2008. In addition, the Tenders Board has recently released Standard Bidding Documents for \nGoods and Works as well as a Procurement Manual which are being pilot tested by line ministries.\" \n9  A detailed description of Samoa\u2019s procurement provisions and processes can be found in ADB\u2013Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development. 2005.

Nevertheless, while processes exist and are applied when official complaints are lodged, \nthe pressure to contribute to cultural functions in Samoa could lead to the misuse of public \nresources  and  entrusted  power.  Gift  giving  and  conflict  of  interests  have  always  been \nchallenges  for  this  very  family-oriented  system.12  Importantly,  too,  the  governing  party\u2019s \noverwhelming  political dominance  means  it  can  do  virtually  anything,  including  amend  the \nConstitution. The opposition is almost powerless to influence government policy. This situation \nhas fueled public suspicion that corruption must occur. This perception is not based on concrete \nevidence but on inference from the government\u2019s long-standing majority. Nevertheless, the \nextent of the government\u2019s political dominance creates an environment in which corruption \ncould flourish. The government must remain vigilant in ensuring that the effective rules and \nprocesses it has put in place are equally effectively implemented and monitored in practice. \nTransparency International\u2019s analysis of integrity systems in Samoa supports this view, arguing \nthat the government should now focus on consolidation by enforcing the rules and regulations it \nalready has in place. \n \n15.  Beyond this, there are further anticorruption measures the government could consider. \nFor example, the Samoan government does not have a specific anticorruption strategy in place. \nHowever, it has endorsed and actively engaged with the ADB\u2013Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific, its action \nplan, and its implementation plan. The three pillars of the implementation plan13 are being \naddressed by ongoing reform programs and through the enforcement of the codes of ethics that \nare in place for Parliament and the public service. As part of its involvement in the ADB\u2013OECD \ninitiative, Samoa has completed self-assessments on corruption both generally and specifically \nin relation to public procurement. The initial reports are publicly available14 but could usefully be \nupdated and expanded. Although Samoa has in place agencies that administer compliance \nissues, consideration should now be given to establishing a specialist anticorruption agency or \nunit charged with coordinating efforts to prevent and eliminate corruption. At present, in relation \nto the Money Laundering Prevention Act 2007, the central bank undertakes these functions on \nbehalf of the Ministry of Finance. Beyond this, the new Law and Justice Sector Plan will look at \ninteragency coordination on anticorruption issues. \n                                                 \n12 Transparency International. 2004. National Integrity Systems Country Study Report Samoa 2004. Berlin. \n13 The three pillars are (i) developing effective and transparent systems for public service, (ii) strengthening anti-\nbribery actions and promoting integrity in business operations, and (iii) supporting active public involvement. \n14 See also ADB\u2013OECD. 2003.

Overview \n \n1.  Samoa launched an aggressive state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform effort in the mid-\n1980s, which led to the restructuring and divestment of 20 loss-making SOEs, half of the \ncountry\u2019s SOE portfolio. The government retains full ownership of 15 public trading bodies, 7 \npublic beneficial bodies, and 3 public mutual bodies that collectively comprise the SOEs.  \n \n2.  With the passage of the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act 2001 and \nthe subsequent policy paper on SOE ownership, performance, and divestment, the government \nestablished the principles by which it would place its public enterprises on a commercial footing \nand divest all public enterprises not deemed strategic.1 The framework provides a sound basis \nfor restructuring public enterprises, strengthening their corporate governance practices, and \nproviding for funding noncommercial activities via community service obligations (CSOs) issued \nin an open and transparent manner. The framework represents best practice in the Pacific and \nimproves on the New Zealand SOE act upon which it is based.2 \n \n3.  However, implementing the public enterprise framework has proven difficult, and the \npace  of  SOE  reform  in  the  first  decade  of  the  millennium  has  been  well  below  publicly \nannounced plans. A recent study shows that the average return on assets of the commercial \nSOEs for 2002\u20132006 was \u20131.7%, against a long-established government target of 7.0%. Over \nthe same period, the return on assets for infrastructure SOEs was 3.3%, and net government \ncontributions to all SOEs was estimated at $43 million.3 Although much reduced, the risk \nremains of a repeat of the budget blowouts seen in the 1990s and early 2000s that arose from \npoor management of the national airline. \n \n4.  Contributions to the SOEs from the budget are mainly for the operation of the public \nbeneficial bodies that provide health and education services on behalf of the government (Table \nA6.1). The public trading bodies receive a lower total payment, mainly for CSOs payments and \ncapital injections. In fiscal year (FY) 2010 the creation of the Land Transport Authority as an \nSOE, which took over much of the work of the Ministry of Works, Transport, and Infrastructure, \nbrought a large increase in grants to public trading bodies. \n \n5.  Sustainable long-term economic growth will require further progress in SOE reform. The \npassage of the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act 2001, supports sound \npractice  in  the  corporate  governance,  accountability,  and  performance  of  SOEs.  Yet  slow \nimplementation means few of the requirements of the act are fully met. Until the act is fully \nimplemented and enforced, the management of SOEs will lack the commercial imperative and \nflexibility to maximize their efficiency, and checks and balances on the operation of SOEs and \ntheir  use  by  the  government  will  remain  inadequate.  Full  implementation  of  the  act, \nsupplemented by strengthening the State-Owned Enterprises Monitoring Division of the Ministry \nof Finance, would offer substantial benefits to the economy at a relatively small financial or \nsocial cost. \n \n                                                 \n1 State-Owned Enterprise Monitoring Division, Treasury Department, Ministry of Finance. 2002.

Community Service Obligations \n \n6.  Many of the SOEs are required to provide subsidized or free services to communities \nthrough CSOs. In the past, they were expected to defray these expenses by raising charges to \npaying  customers\u2014a  process  generally  known  as  cross-subsidization.  The  Public  Bodies \n(Performance  and  Accountability)  Act  now  allows  SOEs  to  claim  reimbursement  from  the \ngovernment for the cost of providing CSOs. Conflicting interpretations of what constitutes a \nCSO have seen SOEs requesting CSO payments for services that they are providing under no \nexplicit obligation to provide or simply cannot provide efficiently. Similarly, there appear to be \ncases where SOEs fulfill CSOs that do not qualify for direct compensation. If properly contracted \nand  funded,  the  delivery  of  these  CSOs  should  not  have  an  adverse  impact  on  SOEs\u2019 \nprofitability. The reality, however, is that CSOs are not clearly identified, costed, contracted, or \nfunded. This poor CSO management depresses SOEs\u2019 profitability, contributes to inefficient \nresource allocation, and impairs the government\u2019s ability to assess whether or not the CSOs \nprovide value for money. \n \n7.  A  2007  CSO  policy  paper  clarified  the  government\u2019s  goals  for  CSO  delivery  and \nsimplified its implementation. This policy effectively limits CSOs to projects that are consistent \nwith the goals identified in the SDS and alleviate hardship in Samoa. The new policy includes a \nstreamlined process of CSO identification, prioritization, approval, and compensation. If strictly \napplied, this new CSO policy should cause SOEs to discontinue activities that they consider to \nbe CSOs but for which no further compensation will be received from the government.  \n \n8.  Implementation  of  the  new  CSO  policy  framework  should  be  guided  by  the  clear \nseparation  of  the  government\u2019s  dual  role  as  both  the  purchaser  and  provider  of  CSOs. \nInternational  experience  shows  that  functioning  purchaser\u2013provider  models  are  critical  to \nenabling  all  stakeholders  in  CSO  delivery  to  efficiently  articulate  and  deliver  on  their \ncommitments. In practical terms, the purchaser\u2013provider model requires the formulation of a \ncontract specifying the precise nature of the service to be provided and the mechanisms by \nwhich  that  service  will  be  measured  and  compensated.  In  the  case  of  Electricity  Power \nCompany and Samoa Water Authority, CSO payment should be linked to specific outputs where \npossible. For example, Samoa Water Authority\u2019s provision of electricity for boreholes could be \ncompensated according to the quantity of water pumped, thus providing an incentive to explore \nalternative delivery mechanisms. Similarly, the provision of power to rural communities could be \n ", "  Appendix 6  51\ncompensated by kilowatt hours delivered, according to an efficient benchmark. CSOs should be \nsubject to pre-approval and benefit\u2013cost analysis. \n \n9.  Even if rigorously implemented, the infrastructure service SOEs would probably still \nprovide returns far below their cost of capital. For example, Samoa\u2019s Electric Power Corporation \nreceived only 36% of its requested funding for CSOs in FY2005, and it generated a return on \nequity of 0%. In FY2006, the company received 13% of its request and its rate of return on \nequity was 1%. This analysis shows that, even if the CSOs had been fully funded according to \nthe corporation\u2019s own calculation of costs, its return on equity would have been only 3.5% in \nFY2005  and  6.2%  in  FY2006.  The  corporation  would  still  have  been  unable  to  meet  the \ngovernment\u2019s return on equity target of 7.0% or the private sector\u2019s benchmark of 10.0%\u2013\n15.0%. While the methodology for estimating true CSO costs certainly needs to be improved \nacross the Pacific island countries, there are many examples demonstrating that SOEs\u2019 poor \nfinancial results cannot be fully attributed to unfunded CSOs. They can be attributed, however, \nto politicized decision making that does not respect commercial objectives and directs SOEs to \nengage in noncommercial activities outside the formal CSO framework. \n \nC.  Corporate Governance Reform \n \n10.  With the enactment of the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act 2001, \nSOEs were given a set of guidelines and requirements to strengthen their corporate governance \npractices and support more commercial orientation. The act, which took effect in 2003, sets out \na number of key prescriptions: (i) the process for selecting and appointing directors, (ii) the role \nof directors, (iii) reporting requirements, (iv) the disclosure of conflicts of interest, (v) the role and \ncomposition of the audit committees, and (vi) policies and procedures for contracting CSOs. \n \n11.  While the act is based on international best practice in SOE corporate governance, \nimplementation has proven to be a challenge; as of end-2006, COEs were fully meeting only the \nreporting and disclosure requirements. Of the other provisions, only one SOE (SamoaTel) has \ncomplied with the spirit of the selection and appointment process for directors and appointed a \nchairman of the board from the private sector. While many SOEs now have audit committees, \nfew of them are fully operational.  \n \n12.  Department heads remain on SOE boards, and ministers remain as chairpersons.4 Their \npresence increases the risk that SOEs are operated on noncommercial terms and potentially \nsubject to political pressures. The preferred arrangement is they be commercially focused, \nindependently  operated  entities  subject  to  clear  lines  of  public  accountability.  Conflicts  of \ninterest  can  also  arise  from  the  existing  board  membership.  For  example,  distortions  to \ncompetition can arise as ministries have vested interests in ensuring that SOEs benefit from \nsector policy, and conflicts can arise in ensuring the collection of outstanding debts owed by \nministries. \n \n13.  Concerns exist that it may be difficult to replace ministers and public servants on SOE \nboards for lack of skilled directors. In the interim, the government is agreeable to recruiting \nexpatriate directors to SOE boards. Taking a longer-term view, the Samoa Institute of Directors \nwas established in November 2005 and is working on reforming SOE board structure and \ncomposition. The government requires directors of SOEs to attend training courses at the \nSamoa  Institute  of  Directors  as  part  of  the  capacity-building  program  to  strengthen  SOE \ncorporate  governance.  The  training  program  for  directors  is  being  strengthened  and \n                                                 \n4  Of the 25 SOEs, 14 are chaired by their sector ministers. \n ", "52   Appendix 6 \ncomplemented with assistance from the European Union and the New Zealand Agency for \nInternational Development. \n \n14.  The government has recently adopted an action plan to bring the membership of SOE \nboards regard to the membership of SOE boards into line with the requirements of the Public \nBodies (Performance and Accountability) Act 2001. The plan sets out the key objectives and \nactivities for to be pursued in 2010 (Table A6.2). \n \nTable A6.2: Summary of the SOE Action Plan \nObjective  Strategy  Deadline \nReplacement of  Draft a legislation to amend all Governing  By the end of June 2010 \nMinister, Members  Public Body's Legislation \n \nof Parliament and \nPublic Servants on  Implement the recommendations off the action  By the end of 2010 \nPublic Body Boards  plan paper \nDue process for the  Cabinet to approve the process for selecting  By the end of March 2010 \nappointment of  and appointing directors \ndirectors on Public \nEstablish and appoint the members of an  By the end of March 2010 \nBody Boards \nindependent Selection Committee \nMinistry of Finance to work with the Samoa  Ongoing \nInstitute of Directors in maintaining a database \nfor current and potential Public Body's \ndirectors, which will be forwarded to the \nIndependent Selection Committee to assist with \nthe selection of directors on Public Body \nBoards \nDirectors appointed  Cabinet to make training for directors  By the end of March 2010 \nare experienced with  mandatory. \ncontinued training to \nMinistry of Finance to work with the Samoa  By the end of June 2010 \nenhance skills and \nInstitute of Director to provide trainings for all \nexpertise \nPublic Body Directors \n \nAccreditation system for all local directors  Ongoing \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \nD.  Privatization \n \n15.  In March 2004, the cabinet approved a paper calling for the immediate privatization of \nseven  SOEs,  three  of  which  were  majority  state-owned.  The  government  completed  the \ndivestment of three of the four minority holdings over the next 2 years,but privatizing the three \n \nmajority-owned SOEs has been hampered by delays. The cabinet has indefinitely postponed \ntwo  of  the  transactions\u2014the  sale  of  Agricultural  Stores  Corporation  and  Samoa  Shipping \nServices\u2014despite the recommendation of privatization advisors to proceed. A third majority-\nowned SOE, Samoa Broadcasting Corporation, was privatized in 2008. In 2006, the government \nrestructured Samoa\u2019s loss-making airline, Polynesian Airlines, resulting in a joint venture with \nVirgin  Blue  Airlines  to  operate  the  airline\u2019s  international  routes.  This  successful  venture \nillustrates the substantial efficiency gains that can come with privatization.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  53\n16.  SOE divestiture was included in the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS), \n2008-2012.  If  the  government  is  to  successfully  execute  the  privatization  of  its  remaining \nnonstrategic  SOEs  as  per  the  terms  of  its  policy  paper  and  SDS,  it  will  need  political \ncommitment  at  the  highest  levels  to  overcome  resistance  from  vested  interests  in  the \ngovernment and SOEs and potential public opposition. International experience demonstrates \nthat public support for SOE divestiture can be garnered through (i) public disclosure of SOE \nfinancial performance, and (ii) illustrating the benefits of improved services through private \nprovision. Further public support for privatization could be encouraged through the annual \npublication of SOE accounts and key performance indicators in widely circulated newspapers. \n \n17.  Restructuring strategies will need to be developed for each SOE to be privatized. To do \nthis objectively, the government should determine its objectives for each transaction. Such \nobjectives are typically expressed in terms of (i) employment preservation, (ii) service continuity, \nand/or (iii) maximization of proceeds. Maximizing proceeds is generally possible only when \nassets are competitively tendered and no conditions of service are placed on the investor. \n ", "54   Appendix 7 \nPOVERTY AND GENDER ANALYSIS \nA.   Overview \n \n1.  Samoa ranked second among the six Pacific developing member countries included in \nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 2009 Human Development Report, which \nplaces it in the medium human development category.1 Life expectancy is high at 75 years, \ninfant mortality is low at 24 per 1,000 live births, enrollment rates exceed 90% at the primary \nlevel, the adult literacy rate is 99%, and the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was \nestimated to be $2,968 in 2009 (current prices). The country is well advanced in meeting most \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. The decline in the reported poverty incidence has \nexceeded the target, universal primary education has almost been achieved, there is gender \nparity in primary schools, and child and maternal mortality have been reduced. 2  \n \n2.  Samoa\u2019s social progress results from its long-standing and robust economic growth, \nsupported by political stability and far-reaching reforms, substantial remittances from Samoans \nabroad, and high public expenditure on education and health. Samoa\u2019s performance is also \nanchored on a sustained commitment to reforms and good governance. \n \n3.  This level of well-being is nevertheless fragile. Small island developing states like Samoa \nare vulnerable to external influences beyond their control, as demonstrated by the impact of the \ncurrent global economic crisis and recent earthquakes and tsunamis. Worsening economic \nconditions have resulted in the temporary loss of jobs at the Yazaki vehicle parts plant, the \ncountry's largest private employer. The deterioration in economic conditions in host countries \ncaused remittances to fall by 18% in real terms in September 2009 on a year-on-year basis. \nAround 80% of cannery workers in American Samoa are Western Samoans temporarily residing \nin the territory. Until 2009, the territory's two tuna-processing facilities employed 5,000 workers. \nHowever, the extension of United States minimum wage laws to American Samoa caused the \nclosure of one of these canneries and the loss of 2,000 jobs in 2009. Lost competitiveness \nbecause of higher labor costs makes uncertain the future of the country's remaining cannery, \nwhich has already laid off 350 workers. Samoa experienced 14 major natural disasters between \n1950 and 2009. During disaster years, it has been estimated that Samoa\u2019s economic losses \nhave averaged 46% of GDP.3 The earthquake and tsunami of 29 September 2009 are reported \nto have affected at least 5,274 people and 19 villages and caused at least $106 million in \ndamage and losses.4  \n \n4.  Not all Samoans have fully participated in and shared the benefits of recent growth. \nPreliminary evidence indicates that, although the proportion of households facing hardship in \nApia and surrounding areas fell between 2002 and 2008, poverty in Savaii and parts of Upolu \nhas increased. In 2002, the Gini coefficient was estimated to be 0.43, which suggests that the \ndistribution of income in Samoa is relatively unequal. Samoan households that suffer hardship \nexperience  poverty  of  opportunity,  which  is  manifested  in  the  lack  of  (i)  access  to  public \nservices, including access to a high-quality education, reliable and affordable power, and safe \nwater and sanitation; (ii) adequate income to meet basic household needs and customary \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2009.

Formal and Informal Safety Nets \n \n5.  As with the other Pacific developing member countries, the Samoan social safety net is a \nmix of kinship, community, nongovernment organization (NGO), and government support and \nservices. In Samoa, there is heavy reliance on the traditional informal social safety net systems \n(Fa'a  Samoa),  particularly  remittances,  in  the  absence  of  a  well-developed  social  security \nsystem. In general, kinship and community support is provided for individuals and families \nfacing a crisis. This support extends to providing long-term assistance to the disabled and \nchronically afflicted.  NGO and church support is mainly directed toward short-term crises, \nthough some provide health services and accommodation for those in need. At the same time, \nthere is evidence that meeting numerous church and village obligations (faalavelave) has put \npressure  on  vulnerable  households  by  reducing  available  resources  for  meeting  basic \nhousehold needs such as education and health.5 \n \n6.  There are good opportunities for overseas migration, particularly to New Zealand, which \ngrants  residency  permits  to  at  least  1,100  Samoans  annually.  New  Zealand's  seasonal \nemployment scheme provides a number of temporary unskilled employment opportunities to \nSamoans. Remittances have increased to around 20% of the GDP and are a major source of \ncash income, particularly for subsistence households. According to the 2006 census, 45% of all \nhouseholds nationally received remittances; 6% of households claimed remittances as their \nprimary source of income; and 10% of household depended on income from remittances, \nplantations, and fishing to meet their basic needs.   \n \n7.  The government provides financial support for senior citizens. Under the Samoa Senior \nCitizens Benefit Scheme, everyone over the age of 65 is provided ST125 per month (2009 level \nof benefits). Also, the government provides for death benefits under the accident compensation \nscheme, which were increased from ST2,500 to ST44,000 in 2008.  \n \nC.   Vulnerable Groups \n \n8.  While there has been no systematic attempt to identify the groups who are vulnerable, \nsocial research shows that vulnerable groups in Samoa include landless families, unemployed \nyouths and adults, single-income households, families with many children to look after, people \nliving in isolated villages with poor transport, and people living with disabilities.6 \n \n9.  Despite good living standards and achievements in education and health, there is little \ncash employment outside Apia. Subsistence agriculture remains important for much of the \ncountry's rural population, as 47% of the economically active population reported spending at \nleast some of their time engaged in subsistence activities in 2006. One percent of economically \nactive people over the age of 15 were reported to be unemployed in 2006, compared with 5% in \n2001.7 Yet job creation in the formal public and private sector has not kept pace with the number \nof new job seekers. About 5,000 individuals leave school and enter the formal labor market \neach year, compared with total employment of 21,600 in 2006. Unemployed youths between the \nages of 15 and 24 accounted for nearly two-thirds of all unemployed persons in 2006.

By regional standards, Samoan women score highly on the gender development index \nand gender empowerment measure. Samoa ranks 89th out of 156 countries in the 2007\u20132008 \nUNDP Gender-Related Development Index. Women have good access to education. Samoa \nhas reached gender parity in primary enrollment rates, and female enrollment in secondary \nschools is higher than male enrollment, with gross enrollment rates of 85% versus 76%. Yet, \nthere is a relative lack of vocational training opportunities for women in rural areas and the \ninformal sector.  While women\u2019s health indicators in Samoa are good compared with those of \nother Pacific countries, complications arising from pregnancy and childbirth are still a major \ncause of death among women, especially women in rural and remote areas.8  \n \n11.  Despite women\u2019s progress in education, women still face disadvantages in their access \nto economic and political resources.  Women are only half as likely as men to be economically \nactive  (33%  compared  with  65%),  and  only  about  one-third  of  paid  workers  are  women.9  \nWomen have little protection from labor-related discrimination. The global economic crisis is \nbelieved to have caused job loss for many women, as large numbers of them were employed in \nthe Yazaki vehicle parts plant10 and canneries. The impacts of the recent tsunami on tourism will \naffect women\u2019s employment, as many paid women workers are engaged in tourism-related \nservices and sales.  \n12.  Women\u2019s limited ownership of land constrains their productive potential and access to \nfinancial resources.  Although the availability of freehold land is increasing, 78% of the country\u2019s \nland is under customary ownership, and only those with chiefly titles (matai) may lease land.11  \nYet, only 20% of matai title holders are women because of Samoa\u2019s patriarchal system of \nvillage chiefs. While a few organizations provide microfinance in rural areas (e.g., Women in \nBusiness Development Inc. and the Small Business Enterprise Center and the South Pacific \nBusiness  Development),  many  rural  women  lack  the  financial  literacy  and  business  skills \nneeded to utilize available opportunities.12 \n \n13.  Basic service delivery. The SDS prioritizes improved education and health outcomes \nand  community  development  for  all.  Special  attention  is  given  to  the  most  disadvantaged \nhouseholds, which are those with the least access to cash incomes from paid work, remittances, \nor farm production. \n \n1.   Education \n \n14.  The Government of Samoa is strongly committed to improving access to education and \nits quality. The education sector receives a substantial share of public spending, and in recent \nyears has accounted for around 22%\u201325% of the government budget. In Samoa, most primary \nschools are operated by village committees in partnership with the government. Staff salaries, \nstationery, and textbooks are funded by the government, while parents are responsible for \nproviding buildings and furniture, as well as covering maintenance costs. Private and church \nschools also provide education at all levels but are usually more expensive than public schools. \n \n                                                 \n8  United Nations Children's Fund. 2006.

Despite reaching a national enrollment rate of 99% in 2004, in recent years Samoa has \nseen its national intake and enrollment rates fall despite laws that make school compulsory up \nto year 8. The national intake for year 1 students fell from 88% in 2000 to 78% in 2006. In \naddition, the proportion of children of official admission age not enrolled in year 1 increased \nfrom 12% in 2000 to 22% in 2006.13 Children in Samoa drop out of school for a number of \nreasons, including the lack of ability to pay school fees or parental support, low priority placed \non  education,  loss  of  interest,  peer  pressure  to  drop  out,  chronic  health  problems,  and \nmisbehavior. Over the past few years, an increasing number of children have been observed \nselling merchandise in the streets of Apia during school hours.14 \n \n16.  Also, despite increased government support for early childhood education, enrollment \nrates remain low at around 35%. Low enrollment rates have been attributed the poor quality of \nservice, as many early childhood education programs do not meet the standards of the National \nCouncil for Early Childhood Education Samoa because of limited funding; the lack of qualified \nteachers; and the poor quality of classroom facilities, equipment, and learning material. \n \n18.  There are notable differences in the condition of classroom facilities and educational \nattainment  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  For  example,  students  in  the  Apia  urban  area  are \nconsistently more likely to stay to year 8 that are rural students. While retention rates have \nimproved in areas of Upolu, retention rates in Savaii fell from 91% in 2001 to 82% in 2006. Rural \nchildren generally have less access to secondary education than do those living in urban areas. \nUrban areas of Apia have higher transition rates to secondary school than do rural areas. This is \nlikely because 18 of the country's 46 secondary schools are located in Apia, despite only 21% of \nthe population living in this area. In addition, schools in rural areas generally operate with lower-\nquality facilities and learning inputs. This situation has improved somewhat under the Education \nSector Project II, which has provided funding for renovations and equipment for secondary \nschools in rural and disadvantaged areas and the pursuit of a national policy to upgrade all rural \nsecondary schools so that the same opportunities available to urban students are also offered to \nthose rurally based. \n \n19.  Access to education is particularly low among children with disabilities. In 2002, for \nexample, 87% of children with disabilities did not attend school. However, in recent years the \ngovernment has drafted a special needs education policy and has begun providing grants to \nNGOs to support the delivery of special needs education. It has also established six special \nneeds units in selected schools on Upolu and Savaii where the need for such facilities has been \nidentified. However, these facilities lack resources, including sufficient numbers of qualified \nteachers. The Government of Australia has provided substantial support for inclusive education \nunder its Samoa-Australia partnership arrangements. \n \n20.  Community  and  parental  responsibility  for  providing  school  facilities  and  covering \nmaintenance  and  operating  costs  for  some  school  activities  tends  to  re-enforce  inequality \nbetween communities. As a result, disadvantaged or less well-organized communities generally \nhave schools that are in poorer condition and students with lower educational outcomes.  \n \n21.  In response to the impacts of the global economic crisis, which has seen an increasing \nnumber of children being withdrawn from school for lack of ability to pay their school fees, the \ngovernment is implementing the Targeted School Fee Payment Scheme, funded by Australia \nand New Zealand for ST4 million, which will provide targeted payments to vulnerable groups to \nmeet the cost of primary school fees over the medium term. \n                                                 \n13  Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture. 2007.

Samoa has achieved reasonably good basic health outcomes in recent decades as a \nresult  of  high  public  expenditure  in  this  sector.  However,  the  high  incidence  of  non-\ncommunicable  diseases  poses  a  serious  health  challenge  Samoa's  population.  Primary, \nsecondary, limited tertiary, and public health services are provided through public facilities, \nincluding referral to hospitals in Apia and on Savaii, a number of district hospitals, health centers \nand sub-center visiting services provided on an outreach basis. Tertiary care is provided mainly \nin New Zealand. A network of women's committees co-manages publicly funded rural health \nservices.  \n \n23.  Despite the wide geographic distribution of health facilities, financing for rural primary \nhealth services has been low, and facilities have deteriorated. Rural facilities often endure poor \nmaintenance or lack essential equipment, medical supplies, or basic drugs. The difficulty of \nmaintaining  the  quality,  staffing,  and  use  of  rural  health  services\u2014along  with  recent \nimprovements in transport and communications\u2014has caused increased pressure on central \nfacilities. People often bypass local clinics managed by nurses, expecting better service from \ndoctors at larger facilities. Consequently, admissions to district hospitals and health centers \nhave  decreased  substantially  as  a  share  of  total  admissions,  while  the  share  of  inpatient \nservices provided by Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital increased to 84% in 2006.  \n \n24.  There is growing evidence that the health needs of vulnerable groups, particularly those \nliving in rural areas, are not being met. Diagnostic health services are available only in the main \nhospitals, as is specialized care for people with chronic needs such as the elderly and disabled.   \nChildren who are born with or acquire disabilities have high rates of mortality for lack of access \nto health-care or community-support services. Domestic violence is a recognized problem, but it \nis not dealt with by the medical services apart from treating injuries. A relatively small number of \nfamilies are excluded by village leaders from attending village health clinics or participating in \nhealth programs conducted in villages. \n \n25.  Despite  the  provision  of  public  health  services  being  heavily  subsidized  by  the \ngovernment, it has been reported that even the currently small health center charges are \nburdensome  to  many  vulnerable  households.15  Village  women\u2019s  committees  and  district \nhospitals charge an additional fee for services, on top of those charged by the ministry, at a rate \nthat varies from village to village. This additional cost is another reason why people bypass rural \nclinics.  User  fees  are,  however,  a  small  part  of  overall  medical  costs.  Transportation, \nconsultations,  and  medicines  can  be  much  more  expensive.  Government  pharmaceutical \nsupplies are being reduced to encourage more private sector supply, but this may make them \neven less affordable to low-income people. Medicines for chronic problems, such as diabetes \nand hypertension and their complications, are particularly expensive. A 2005 survey found that \nalmost half of the expense for treatments of chronic illness was spent on transportation (24% on \nconsultation, and 28% on medicines).  \n                                                 \n15  ADB.  2009.

The principal bilateral donors are the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID), New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID), Japanese International \nCooperation Agency, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and various agencies of the United \nNations. The multilateral agencies that provide grants and loans are the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), World Bank, European Union (EU), and Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries. \n \n2.  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132012  supports  the  implementation  of  the \nStrategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS) in alignment with the objectives of the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness of 2005. The CPS focuses on poverty reduction with two inter-\nrelated  pillars  for  intervention  addressing  the  binding  constraints  for  growth:  (i)  improved \ndelivery  of  public  services,  including  the  removal  of  infrastructure  constraints,  and  (ii) the \npromotion of private sector development. Priority sectors for the assistance pipeline are (i) \nenergy, (ii) water supply and sanitation and waste management, and (iii) education. Priority \nthemes are private sector development and sustainable economic growth. \n \n3.  Australia and New Zealand have endorsed the Joint Samoa Program Strategy, 2006-\n2010 to support Samoa's national planning processes and priorities. The strategic and enabling \nobjectives  are  to  (i)  improve  opportunities  for  employment  and  investment,  (ii)  facilitate \ncommunity-level  income  and  small  business  opportunities,  (iii)  improve  the  private  sector \nenabling environment, and (iv) enhance the well-being of all Samoans through improved service \ndelivery and community development. Australia takes the lead donor role in (i) public sector \nreform, (ii) law and justice, and (iii) rural development with a focus on income generation. New \nZealand takes a lead donor role in respect of (i) the private sector and tourism, (ii) civil society \nand community development, and (iii) health. Australia and New Zealand work jointly with ADB \nas lead donors to support education. Australia and New Zealand also participate in cofinancing \nprojects (e.g., Australian participation in the Power Sector Expansion Project with ADB and the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation ) and regional technical assistance, mainly with ADB \nand the World Bank). \n \n4.  The EU's country strategy for 2008-2013 is based on the government\u2019s SDS priorities. \nSamoa was allocated \u20ac31.3 million under the 10th European Development Fund, 2008\u20132013. \nApproximately  85%  of  the  national  indicative  program  resources,  or  \u20ac25.5  million,  are \nearmarked for the Water Sector Support Programme. Assistance also includes support for non \nstate actors, a technical cooperation facility and support for the Civil Society Support Fund that \nis cofunded by Australia and New Zealand for the development of community school facilities, \nhealth  facilities,  community  micro  projects,  institutional  strengthening  and  training.  The \nEuropean Investment Bank has funded so far eight lending operations in Samoa with a total \nvalue of \u20ac14.0 million. \n \n5.  Japan\u2019s development cooperation program with Samoa is premised on the SDS 2008-\n2012.  The  focus  of  Japanese  International  Cooperation  Agency  activities  include  several \nprojects of assistance in health, education, transport, and the environment, including waste \nmanagement and small-scale income generation activities. Japan International Cooperation \nAgency is a major co-financier of the 2007 Power Sector Expansion Project together with ADB \nand  Australia.  The  ADB-administered  Japan  Special  Fund  is  a  major  source  of  technical \nassistance for Samoa. \n ", "  Appendix 9  61 \n \nTable A9: Major Development Partners  \nEstimated  Estimated \nDevelopment  Duration  Amount \nPartner  Project name    (million) \nTheme: Law, Economic Management, and Public Policy \nADB  Support for the implementation of SDS 2008-2012  2008\u20132009  $0.6 \n  Private Sector Development Initiative  ongoing  \u2026 \n  Support for external and internal audit  ongoing  \u2026 \nAusAID  Institutional strengthening of police  2004\u20132008  A$15.6 \n  Public sector improvement facility  2005\u20132009  A$10.0 \n  Capacity building\u2014judiciary   2006\u20132011  A$5.0 \nNZAID  Public sector improvement facility  2005\u20132009  NZ$5.0 \n  Capacity building\u2014judiciary  2006\u20132011  NZ$5.0 \nPRC  Legislative Assembly building/Courts Administration building  2007-2010  $20.0 \n  Government office buildings  Ongoing  $40.0 \nUNDP  Good governance  2008\u20132012  $0.4 \nTheme: Water Supply, Sanitation, and Waste Management \nADB  Sanitation and drainage project   2008\u20132010  $5.0 \nEU  Water sector policy support program, including integrated water  Ongoing  ST67 m \nresources management, water supply and sanitation \ninfrastructure, public awareness, and institutional strengthening  \nTheme: Energy \nADB  Power sector expansion project  2008\u20132015  $26.6 \nJICA  Power sector expansion project  2008-2015  $38.0 \nAusAID  Cofinancing of the power sector expansion project  2008\u20132015  A$19.0 \nTheme: Transportation and Communication \nWorld Bank  Infrastructure asset management  2003\u20132010  $21.5  \n  Telecommunications development  2002\u20132009  $4.5 \n  Cyclone emergency response program   2004\u20132008  $4.5 \nUNDP  Information and communication technology development    2008  $0.1 \nTheme: Health, Nutrition, and Social Protection \nWorld Bank  2nd Health sector policy development   2008\u20132013  $3.0 \n  Infrastructure development   2004\u20132010  $21.5 \nAusAID  Tsunami recovery  2009\u20132010  $7.5 \n  Samoa health sector program project   2008\u20132013  A$15.0 \n  Tackling non communicable diseases in Pacific   2007\u20132011  A$20.0 \nNZAID  Tsunami recovery  2009\u20132010  NZ$10.0 \n  Medical treatment/visiting medical experts schemes  annual  NZ$0.7 \nAusAID and  School fee relief scheme  2010  $2.5 \nNZAID \nEU  Tsunami relief  2009\u20132010  \u20ac4.0 \nADB  Tsunami relief  2009  $1.0 \nTheme: Gender and Development \nUNDP  Human rights activities  2008  \u2026 \n  Integrated youth project  2008  $0.1 \nAusAID  Small grants scheme for communities   annual  A$0.5 \nNZAID  Assistance to nongovernment organization and support for  annual  NZ$0.7 \nSamoa Umbrella for Non Governmental Organisations \nTheme: Private Sector Development \nUNDP  Private sector support (consolidates previous UNDP-supported  2009-2010  $0.1 \nStructural Adjustment Facility) \n ", "62  Appendix 9 \nEstimated  Estimated \nDevelopment  Duration  Amount \nPartner  Project name    (million) \nWorld Bank  Technical assistance  2004\u20132008  $0.2 \nEU  European partnership agreement, trade agreements, and related  Ongoing  \u2026 \ntraining \nNZAID  Private sector support facility  2008-2011  NZ$1 \n  Tourism rehabilitation/support  2009-2012  NZ$4 \n\u2026= not available, ADB = Asian Development Bank, A$ = Australian dollar, AusAID = Australian Agency for \nInternational Development, EU = European Union, NZ$ = New Zealand dollar, NZAID = New Zealand Agency for \nInternational Development, JICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, \nUNDP = United Nations Development Programme. \nSource: Development partner websites. \n \n6.  PRC has no specific country strategy and program for Samoa. PRC assistance focuses \nmainly on infrastructure (mainly buildings), long term training and the provision of a medical \nteam. \n \n7.  The United Nations (UN) Development Assistance Framework for the Pacific Subregion \nis the common planning framework for UN agencies in the Pacific and will guide most of the \nUN\u2019s work from 2008 to 2012. The UN Development Assistance Framework represents the first \nregion-wide  response  to  the  UN  operational  reform  process  and  is  a  product  of  several \npartnerships in development, including between two UN country teams in the Fiji Islands and \nSamoa  covering  15  UN  agencies,  funds  and  programs,  and  between  the  UN  and  the \ngovernments  of  14  Pacific  island countries.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme, \nWorld Health Organization, and UN Population Fund provide a range of assistance to Samoa in \nbiodiversity, climate change adaptation, reproductive health, gender, water quality, information \nand communication technology development, good governance, and human rights. \n \n8.  The Pacific Regional Strategy, 2006\u20132009 of the World Bank has two strategic pillars for \nassistance  in  Samoa:  (i)  strengthening  government  capabilities  in  service  delivery  and \n(ii) improving  incentives  for  private  sector  growth  and  employment.  Assistance  focuses  on \ndisaster risk management, health policy and infrastructure development, roads and bridges, \nmarine protected areas, communications development, finance, and trade.  \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination \n \n9.  The planning of development projects begins with project ideas generated by staff in line \nministries, who complete a project proposal form. This is sent to the Sector and Project Unit of \nthe Economic, Policy, and Planning Division for appraisal. The appraisal comprises comments \nthat are designed to improve the proposal, rather than a thorough analysis of net benefits, \nconsistency with the SDS, or relationship to the sector plan (notwithstanding that a number of \nsector plans have yet to be completed).  \n \n10.  Following appraisal, the Sector and Project Unit sends all proposals to the Cabinet \nDevelopment Committee, which meets every 2 months, where they are approved in principle. \nThe  proposals  are  conveyed  to  the  Aid  Coordination  Committee  which,  like  the  Cabinet \nDevelopment Committee, is chaired by the Prime Minister. The Aid Coordination and Debt \nManagement Division in the Ministry of Finance, which provides secretariat services to the Aid \nCoordination Committee, then has the responsibility for resource allocation. \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  63 \n11.  ADB and World Bank have a shared liaison officer position based in the Ministry of \nFinance in Apia. This has enabled greater coordination between these two institutions and \nallows for more regular representation of ADB and World Bank in local meetings to coordinate \ndevelopment partners.  \n \nC.  Achievements and Issues \n \n12.  Samoa became a signatory to the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness, in August \n2008. The Paris Declaration principles are however generally followed in Samoa, where the \nSDS  mean  that  leadership  on  development  policies  and  activities  comes  largely  from \nGovernment, and that donors have agreed to base their programs on the nation\u2019s development \nstrategies. Similarly, harmonization of action is improving, with a number of programs supported \njointly by two or more donors under sector-wide approaches. A draft Aid and Development \nCooperation Policy has been submitted for Cabinet approval which sets out the framework for \neffective  aid  delivery  in  order  to  positively  impact  on  the  development  process.  Currently, \nperformance indicators are being formulated so that the Government and donors can assess \nprogress towards development outcomes. Samoa and the Cook Islands are the only Pacific \ncountries undertaking an evaluation of the Paris Declaration in early 2010. \n \n13.  Support from donors for the preparation and implementation of sector plans is already a \npriority. Sector plans are particularly important focus as they are to provide an important link to \nmedium-term  budgeting  through  the  national  Medium  Term  Expenditure  Framework.  Eight \nsector plans developed to date all have Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks and Monitoring \nand Evaluation frameworks which provide a link to the national Medium Term Expenditure \nFramework. \n \n14.  Progress on managing external assistance is, however, somewhat mixed across sectors. \nNotably,  7  sectors  still  lack  completed  sector  plans  (3  are  under  development  with  the \nremainder yet to initiate activities in this direction). The target is to complete all sector plans by \nthe end of the current SDS. The slow pace of reform of State Owned Enterprises constitutes an \nimportant shortcoming in the contribution of the public sector to development results. And the \napproach to development planning at the program and project level, despite the preparation of \nthe SDS, could be more strategic. The move to adopt sector wide approaches is however an \nimportant change that will help address this concern. \n \nD.  Recommendations \n \n15.  The Government has established a broad ranging and well regarded strategic planning \nprocess and implementation framework. Key elements are the SDS 2008-2012 and its sector \nplans, the Public Financial Management Reform Program and the reform architecture for State \nOwned Enterprises. They provide a sound basis for the alignment and harmonization of external \nassistance, and to meeting the Government preference that more assistance be provided as \nbudget support. \n ", "64 Appendix 10 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry and Project Title: Samoa Economic Recovery Support Program \n \nPacific Department/ \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nProgram Cluster Loan  Pacific  Subregional  Office  in \nModality:  Division: \nSuva \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nThe overall vision of the Strategy for Development of Samoa (SDS), 2008-2012 is to improve the quality of life for all by \nensuring sustainable economic and social progress. The SDS identifies three priority areas for implementation: economic \npolicies, social policies, and public sector management and environmental sustainability. Under the economic policies, two \nmain goals are sustained macroeconomic stability and economic growth and employment creation led by the private sector. \nBroadening economic activity and private sector development is a key strategy for improving economic growth rates and \nreducing poverty and will be supported through the program. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nThe program will help the government limit any short-term increase in poverty incidence arising from the economic slowdown. \nSpecific actions include (i) allocating more of the budget for capital expenditure in accordance with a prioritized Public Sector \nInvestment Program, (ii) establishing a budget process for fiscal year 2010 that limits new expenditure initiatives to priorities \nthat will have immediate and significant impacts and/or support the most vulnerable members of the community, (iii) \npreserving or increasing expenditure on the delivery of public services to the most vulnerable members of the community, (iv) \nimplementing a school fees relief scheme, and (iv) aligning government expenditure and revenue with the medium-term goal. \n2. Design Features  \nSupport for the vulnerable is a feature of the program, in recognition of the extra hardship imposed by the global economic \ncrisis and the preceding episode of high international commodity prices. This support will comprise relief from the payment of \npublic school fees and explicit, progressive reorientation of government programs to target the most vulnerable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. The impact of the program on the budget should provide benefits to the Samoan economy and the Samoan \npeople. As the specific areas of impact and scale of impact will depend on the decisions the government makes once a \nstrengthened policy and legislative environment is in place, an assessment is infeasible at this point.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultation was undertaken with representatives of civil society and agencies responsible for delivering key services during \nwith-country consultation, reconnaissance, and pre-appraisal missions. This was joined with fact-finding for the linked Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction grant. The mission consultation built on consultation undertaken by the government, notably \nthrough a global crisis public forum and in the formulation of a response to tsunami. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing           Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nThe program is instead based on implementing the government's own strategies and plans, notably through the SDS 2008\u2013\n2012, which was developed through a consultative approach and provides mechanisms for ongoing public reporting on \nperformance. The program provides for the government\u2019s design and implementation of a consultation and engagement \nstrategy covering the scope of the program, which will provide feedback from private sector and civil society organizations on \nthe government's development agenda. \n ", "Appendix 10  65\n \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nBy regional standards, Samoan women score highly on the gender development index and gender empowerment measure. \nWomen have good access to education, with near universal access to primary education and higher enrollment than men in \nsecondary education. Women\u2019s health indicators are also good by regional standards, though illness related to pregnancy \nand childbirth still poses health risks for women. \n \nWomen still face disadvantages in their access to economic and political resources. Women are only half as likely as men to \nbe economically active (33% compared with 65%), and only about one-third of paid workers are women. Women have little \nprotection from labor-related discrimination. The global economic crisis is believed to have caused job loss for many women, \nas large numbers of them were employed in the now closed Yazaki vehicle parts plant and in canneries. The recent tsunami\u2019s \neffects on tourism will influence women\u2019s employment, as many paid women workers are engaged in tourism-related services \nand sales. Women\u2019s limited ownership of land constrains their productive potential and access to finance. While there are \norganizations providing microfinance in rural areas, many rural women lack the financial literacy and business skills needed to \nutilize available opportunities. \n \n2.  Key Actions.

These components will include specific measures that \ntarget women and monitor their participation.   \nIII.
