THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the COVID-19 Response Emergency Assistance Project. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Bangladesh (the government) in addressing \nimmediate and urgent needs for financial, logistical, and systemic support to respond to the \nCOVID-19 outbreak. The project will support the procurement of equipment and supplies, the \nupgrading  of  health  and  testing  facilities,  and  build  system  and  community  capacities  for \nsurveillance, prevention, and response to COVID-19.  \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The description of the COVID-19 health emergency. The COVID-19 outbreak, declared \na pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, has spread rapidly \nacross the globe, with severe impact on lives and economies. As of 17 April 2020, over 2 million \nconfirmed cases and over 139,000 deaths have been recorded.1 In Bangladesh, the first case \nwas reported on 8 March 2020. Cases started rising steeply in April, and by 17 April, Bangladesh \nhad confirmed 1,838 cases and 75 deaths due to COVID-19, with a cumulative total of over \n108,000  people  quarantined.2  The  country  is  now  moving  to  the  fourth  stage  of  infection \n(community transmission) with 52 of the 64 districts affected. Millions had already left the cities \nfor their village homes before the lockdown on 26 March, possibly spreading the infection. It is, \ntherefore, crucial to support Bangladesh\u2019s efforts to mitigate the impact and flatten the curve.  \n \n4.  Request for emergency assistance. On 23 March 2020, the government asked the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide emergency assistance for the health sector response \nto COVID-19, as an integral part of the Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP),3 and \nthe National Preparedness and Response Plan (NPRP)  for COVID-19 (para. 7).4 Since then, the \ncaseload has grown more than 55 times. The proposed project meets the requirements for \nemergency assistance loan (EAL) financing.5 A health EAL is justified since (i) it will support the \nurgent need of the health system to immediately respond to the escalating COVID-19 situation; \n(ii) the government has immediate procurement requirements; (iii) dedicated funding for the \ncritical health sector response will be assured; and (iv) the health sector requires significant \ncapacity and implementation support in the short to medium term. Complementary health sector \nsupport is also being extended by the World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO) (para. \n12). The project is part of ADB emergency support for other sectors in Bangladesh (para. 14).  \n \n \n1    Worldometer.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (accessed 17 April 2020); World Health Organization (WHO). \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Reports. https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-\n2019/situation-reports (accessed 17 April 2020). \n2    Coronavirus COVID-19 Dashboard, 2020.

ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  Significant challenges in combatting the pandemic. High population density,6 rapid \nurbanization, a large population of migrant workers, and more than 20% of its urban population \nliving in slums without adequate sanitation, make Bangladesh vulnerable to infectious disease \noutbreaks. For example, cholera affects an estimated 100,000 people and causes some 4,500 \ndeaths  yearly.7  According  to  WHO\u2019s  scale  of  International  Health  Regulations  (IHR)  core \ncapacities, Bangladesh has limited capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health \nemergencies.8 Overall, the health system is underdeveloped and underfunded, with only 9.9 \ndoctors, nurses and midwives9 and 8.8 hospital beds per 10,000 people.10 Current health \nexpenditure is only 2.3% of gross domestic product, while out-of-pocket expenditure accounts for \nover two-thirds of health spending, making healthcare unaffordable to many.11 Following the first \ncase on 8 March 2020, the government allocated Tk500 million (about $6 million) to the Ministry \nof Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) to contain the outbreak, followed by Tk2 billion (about \n$24 million) on 24 March 2020. \n \n6.  Damage and needs assessment.12 The impacts of the damage to the health system and \nthe need for support were assessed by ADB, WHO, and other development partners. The damage \nand needs assessment found weaknesses and risks in four main areas\u2014surveillance and \ndiagnostic  capacity,  testing  and  contact  tracing,  clinical  treatment  capacity,  and  infection \nprevention  and  control  (IPC).  First,  the  surveillance  and  diagnostic  capacity  is  rapidly \nbecoming overstretched. The testing capacity was extended from one to 17 laboratories, as of 17 \nApril 2020.13 However, even with this capacity, the health system will scarcely cope with the \nplanned screening of suspected COVID-19 cases at all 42 points-of-entry (air, sea, and land), as \nwell  as  surveillance  and  diagnosis  within  the  country.  Second,  insufficient  testing  and \ninadequate contact tracing and quarantine measures mean that the full extent of cases is \nunknown. A total of 19,193 tests have been conducted as of 17 April 202014 (or 117 tests per \nmillion population). Third, the clinical treatment capacity is inadequate, with shortages of \nventilators to support critical patients, insufficient specialized wards and hospitals, low hospital \nbed capacity (para. 5), and only 878 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 296 intermediate care unit \nbeds nationally available across public and private sectors.15 Reportedly, suspected COVID-19 \npatients were turned away from health facilities due to such inadequacies. In addition, there is a \nneed for contracting-in, recruitment, and training of human resources (such as medical officers, \nnurses, medical technologists, etc.). Fourth, the inadequacy of IPC measures poses a risk. \nReports from the field indicate shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) and other \nsupplies, and insufficient sanitized ambulances to transport patients.16  \n \n6   Bangladesh has 1,253 people per square kilometer of land area, among the highest density in the world.

The damage and needs assessment identified urgent needs that are reflected in the \ngovernment\u2019s NPRP and CPRP. The CPRP, prepared by the government and development \npartners to support the NPRP, is estimated at $378 million. It has five pillars: (i) surveillance and \nlaboratory support; (ii) contact tracing and points of entry; (iii) case management and infection \nprevention and control; (iv) risk communication and awareness and community engagement; and \n(v) logistics and procurement. The NPRP has seven components: (i) planning and coordination; \n(ii) surveillance, laboratory, and points of entry; (iii) contact tracing and quarantine; (iv) clinical \ncase management; (v) IPC; (vi) risk communication and public awareness; and (vii) operational \nresearch. The damage and needs assessment, the NPRP, and the CPRP together informed the \ngovernment\u2019s request for assistance to each development partner (para. 11).  \n \n8.  Disaster risk.17 Bangladesh is highly susceptible to various types of natural hazards, \nincluding cyclones, flooding, landslides, windstorms, heat waves, and cold spells. Climate change \nis expected to aggravate the intensity, frequency, and unpredictability of extreme weather events. \nThe 2019 World Risk Index ranks Bangladesh as the 10th most vulnerable country among 180 \ncountries.18 Disease outbreaks often follow natural disasters.  \n \n9.  Economic impacts. ADB estimates19 indicate that a significant domestic outbreak would \nlead to an economic loss of up to $13.3 billion, 4.9% of gross domestic product, and the loss of \n1.4 million to 3.7 million jobs. The pandemic will affect the economy through three main channels: \nslowdown in domestic economies, sharp decline in exports, and reduction in remittances.20 \n \n10.  Poverty impacts. With 20.5% of the population under the poverty line, and 10.5% living \nin extreme poverty (FY2019),21 Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to economic shocks. Any \neconomic shock would push a significant proportion of the near-poor under the poverty line and \ndeepen the poverty of those already poor, reversing previous gains made in poverty reduction. \nOf the total workforce, 85% (of whom 92% are women) operate in the informal economy, leading \na hand-to-mouth existence.22 Social distancing and quarantine measures will affect the livelihoods \nof small traders, day laborers, and other informal workers. The official unemployment rate is 4.3%. \nHowever, many employed in the ready-made garment sector and micro, small, and medium \nenterprises may already have lost their jobs, and economic downturn will further dampen the \nemployment market. The poor are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases such as COVID-\n19, due to overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and poor access to health services.  \n \n11.  Development  partners  coordination.  Development  partners  are  supporting  the \nresponse and are part of the National Coordination Committee for Prevention and Control of \nCOVID-19, chaired by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). The government has \nset up the COVID-19 Emergency Operation Center at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease \nControl and Research (IEDCR) to coordinate preparedness and response measures at five \n \n17   Disaster risk is a function of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. \n18   World Risk Index developed by B\u00fcndnis Entwicklung Hilft in cooperation with the United Nations University.

No later data is \navailable. \n ", "4   \nlevels.23 The IEDCR conducts contact tracing and most of the surveillance.24 The NPRP provides \nsix response levels depending on COVID-19 infection status, as well as mechanisms for surge \ncapacity  to  manage  patients,  sustain  essential  services,  and  reduce  social  impacts.  The \ngovernment, with development partners, will continually review and adjust the response as \nnecessary. \n \n12.  The  government  is  closely  planning  and  coordinating  the  emergency assistance  by \nworking with each development partner to allocate specific elements of the CPRP, in line with the \ncountry\u2019s needs and the volume of assistance provided. Thus, the World Bank Group\u2019s loan \nproject for COVID-19 response will support information-technology-based approaches to disease \nsurveillance, and training and equipment for the facilities and geographic areas identified by the \ngovernment.25 WHO will support the more technical aspects of IPC, such as laboratory testing \nand clinical case management. To support the Rohingya people, the government has a separate \nprogram to prevent the breakout of COVID-19 in the camps and mitigate any impact through \nestablishing isolation units and providing health facilities for them. The World Bank has two \nongoing grant projects ($185 million) for the health sector to manage and mitigate COVID-19 \nimpact in camp areas within the Coxsbazar district. ADB is exploring additional grant funds to \ncomplement the World Bank support.  \n \n13.  Lessons in disaster response. First, the joint IHR evaluation with WHO in 2016 (footnote \n8) revealed limited capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies. Another \nevaluation  highlighted  inadequate  on-site  monitoring  and  subdistrict-based  healthcare.26 \nTherefore, efforts are needed to strengthen the medium- to long-term capacity to handle health \nemergencies and meet IHR standards, raise community risk awareness, and improve health risk \nmanagement planning. Second, any response to COVID-19 must incorporate key lessons learned \nby other countries in combating the disease. Third, duplication and gaps are recurring features in \nthe management of large disasters everywhere, so the coordination of emergency assistance \nrequires extra attention. \n \n14.  Proposed ADB support.27 The project complements other ADB support for COVID-19 \nresponse by providing urgently needed health equipment, supplies, and infrastructure, and limited \nactivities to strengthen the health workforce. As initial support, ADB had provided $350,000 \ntechnical assistance grant from ADB regional technical assistance (RETA) Regional Support to \nAddress  the  Outbreak  of  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  and  Potential  Outbreaks  of  Other \nCommunicable Diseases. Complementing these health sector interventions are: (i) a $500 million \nloan,  comprising  $250  million  from  ordinary  capital  resources  lending  and  $250  million \nconcessional  loan  for  countercyclical  support  to  address  downstream  effects  of  increased \nspending on social protection, salary support to workers, and low interest loans to affected \nsectors; and (ii) an attached TA grant of $1 million to support strengthening the social safety net \n \n23  The five levels of coordination for COVID-19 efforts are (i) the Inter-ministerial National Committee, and Multi-sectoral \nCoordination Committees at (ii) Divisional, (iii) District, (iv) City Corporation, and (v) Upazila (subdistrict) levels. \n24  The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research is the WHO-recognized National Influenza Centre. \n25  The project ($100 million) has three components: (i) surveillance, diagnostics and community engagement; (ii) healthcare \nstrengthening; and (iii) institutional capacity to improve management, monitoring, and preparedness.

ADB support \ncorresponds to all pillars of the CPRP. ADB will ensure there is no duplication through its Bangladesh Resident Mission, \nwhich is coordinating closely with other development partners.  \n ", "5 \nand institutional capacity.28 The proposed project aligns with four operational priority areas within \nStrategy 2030: (i) addressing poverty and reducing inequalities, through improved health and \ndisease control; (ii) accelerating gender equality, through recruitment and training targets for \nwomen, and gender-sensitive health services; (iii) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity,  in  health,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  procurement,  and  financial \nmanagement; and (iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration through mitigating cross-\nborder risks of infectious diseases.29 The project aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor Bangladesh 2016\u20132020 in the priority areas of easing infrastructure constraints, providing \ndisaster resilient  services,  improving  human  capital  and  healthcare, and  promoting  gender \nequality.30  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: accelerated social and economic recovery \nof the COVID-19 affected population in Bangladesh (footnote 4). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: health and wellbeing of COVID-19 affected persons improved. The outcome \nwill be achieved through three outputs.31  \n \n16.  Output 1: Immediate and medium-term equipment needs for testing and managing \nCOVID-19 met. The project will help meet the government\u2019s immediate and medium-term needs \nto prevent the spread of COVID-19, by supporting emergency procurement and the provision of \nthe most crucial medical equipment and supplies. The supplies will enable (i) affected people and \nhealthcare workers to be treated and protected from infection; and (ii) selected health facilities to \nbe  equipped  with  essential  IPC  supplies.

Overall, the project will contribute to the government\u2019s NPRP with vital infrastructure and \nsystem-building support. ADB\u2019s unique contribution will be the experience gained from its ongoing \nUrban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project, which has two main components relevant \nto combating COVID-19: (i) providing primary healthcare services to the urban population, \nespecially the poor and vulnerable; and (ii) fostering of active community leadership in urban \nhealth coordination committees. ADB will also bring additional new technology for screening, \ntesting, and microbiological diagnostic laboratories.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $113.38 million (Table 1), inclusive of taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, and interest and other charges during implementation.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The project will be implemented over 3 years. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be \nestablished in DGHS, the implementing agency. The PIU will comprise a project director and a \ndeputy project director for ADB. The PIU will provide the technical, administrative, and logistical \nsupport  required  for  implementation,  supported  by  consultants,  as  necessary.  Project \nmanagement support will be provided. A project steering committee will provide guidance to the \nPIU and oversee the overall project implementation, meeting at least twice a year or more \nfrequently, if required. A project implementation committee, chaired by the director general, \nDGHS, will provide technical oversight and hands-on supervision, meeting at least quarterly, or \nmore frequently as needed. The PIU and the project implementation committee will work directly \nwith the government entity involved in each component: the COVID-19 Emergency Operation \nCenter  in  preparedness  and  response,  the  subnational  coordination  committees  in \ncommunication,  and  IEDCR  in  surveillance  strengthening  activities.  The  PIU  will  conduct \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  and  quarterly  reviews. Individual  consultants,  such  as  a  project \nmanagement coordinator, and environment, social, procurement, and financial management \nexperts, will be recruited under the project to support the PIU.   \n    \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (footnote 32). \n  \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  May 2020\u2013April 2023a \nEstimated completion date  30 April 2023  \nEstimated loan closing date  31 October 2023   \nManagement \n(i)    Oversight body  Project Steering Committee; Secretary, MOHFW (chair); Director General, \nDGHS (member); officials from different divisions of MOHFW (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  HSD, MOHFW \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  DGHS \nProcurement  OCB (international advertisement)   8 contracts (goods  $102.76 \nOCB (national advertisement)   and works);   million \nDirect Contract  3 contracts  \nLCB  (non-consulting) \nRequest for quotations \nConsulting services  QCBS and CQS, OCB, international  125 person-months  $1.43 \nand/or national advertisement, or LCB  (individual);  million \nSingle source selection  1 firm  \nIndividual consultant international \nadvertisement/national advertisement \n ", "8   \nAspects  Arrangements \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting and retroactive financing will apply for the procurement \nadvance contracting   of civil works, goods, and consulting services, and for project administration. \nThe amount to be retroactively financed will be allowed for up to 30% of the \nloan amount provided that such eligible expenditures incurred before the \neffectiveness of the loan agreement, but not earlier than 8 March 2020. b \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants qualifications selection, DGHS = Directorate General of Health \nServices, HSD = Health Services Division, LCB = local competitive bidding, MOHFW = Ministry of Health and Family \nWelfare, OCB = open competitive bidding, PIU = project implementation unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based \nselection. \na  The project will be implemented over 3 years. The extended implementation period beyond the emergency \n  assistance loan\u2019s norm of 2 years is justified given the (i) possibility of supply chain disruptions during the extended \n  lockdown, which could hamper the procurement of  medical equipment and supplies; (ii) ADB interventions supporting \n  capacity development and systems building in the short to medium term to manage other health emergencies in \n  addition to those related to COVID-19; (iii) capacity constraints of the executing agency and implementing agency;    \n  and (iv) alignment with the government\u2019s 3-year response plan and a related World Bank project.  \nb  8 March 2020 is the date when the government first allocated resources for the response. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. \n \n25.  Procurement. The executing and implementing agencies will carry out all activities related \nto the procurement of goods, works, and consulting services using simplified approaches that are \nin line with the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time), and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  In  formulating  the  procurement  arrangements, \nconsideration was given to value for money to increase efficiency; flexibility measures suited to \nthe context of the emergency health pandemic considering market analysis; the capability of local \nmanufacturers and contractors; and the operating environment, wherein the use of electronic \nprocurement is already in place. To help achieve value for money and to ensure competitive \ntension  in  the  procurement  processes,  several  packages  will  be  tendered  using  various \nprocurement methods, with due attention to flexibility, agility, but also fiduciary compliance to fit \nthe purpose of this emergency loan. Most of the goods contracts for medical equipment and \nsupplies will be awarded through open competitive bidding (OCB) and the national advertisement \nmethod. Civil works procurement, if any, will follow the same approaches. To ensure efficiency, \nspecial procedures for emergency lending will be used, including reducing the bidding period to \n14 days when appropriate; using single-stage one-envelope bidding procedures; and developing \na time-bound action plan to award contracts, including a contract management plan. Some civil \nworks and goods contracts may be procured using direct contracting, where appropriate, following \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Goods needed immediately may be procured using international \nand/or national requests for quotations subject to prior review by ADB. Subject to bidding \ndocuments being modified to comply with ADB requirements, the national electronic government \nprocurement system will be used for OCB to award most of the goods and civils works contracts, \nalthough manual or off-line bidding may be used where appropriate. \n \n26.  Consulting firm(s) will be recruited through OCB procedures, local advertisements, and/or \nlimited competitive bidding using a quality- and cost-based selection procedure, a simplified \ntechnical proposal, or a biodata technical proposal. Other methods, such as the consultants\u2019 \nqualification  selection,  may  also  be  used  where  appropriate.  For  implementation  support, \nindividual consultants will be recruited using the individual selection method with international \nand/or local advertisements, based on the project\u2019s requirements. Consultants who are already \nengaged in ADB-financed projects and provide similar services as those required for the project \nmay be recruited directly, subject to their satisfactory performance. This arrangement will provide \n ", "9 \nan  efficient  way  to  recruit  consultants  under  the  circumstances.  Local  nongovernment \norganizations may provide some social and gender studies and/or support. The option to have a \ndirect contract or a memorandum of understanding with nongovernment organizations and/or \nUnited Nations agencies already engaged in the project area may also be explored where \nappropriate.  \n \n27.  All  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  will  be  procured  based  on  the  detailed \narrangements in the project\u2019s procurement plan, including procurement and selection methods, \ntype of bidding documents, and ADB\u2019s review requirements. ADB will review the first contract per \nbidding method per implementing agency prior to bidding, and the rest of the contracts will be \npost-reviewed (sampling). The executing and implementing agencies will be required to (i) use \nthe Procurement Activity Monitoring Tool, a web-based database, to record and monitor the time \ntaken for each step of the procurement process and to track any delays; and (ii) take appropriate \nactions for all prior and post-review packages of goods and works under the project. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  All project activities will incorporate measures to strengthen resilience to future epidemics \nand disease outbreaks, thus addressing the systemic weaknesses found in Bangladesh\u2019s IHR \ncore capacities (para. 5). All new and upgraded infrastructure will be disaster-resilient and climate-\nsmart based on hazard, climate, and risk analyses; modified design criteria and careful selection \nof materials; and monitoring of field practices. The project has a low climate risk category because \nmost facilities will be constructed within existing structures such as health centers, medical \ncolleges, and ports. Project management actions need to include strong contingency planning for \npotential physical impacts resulting from an increase in temperature (heat stress) and extreme \nrainfall events (floods). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  The project is likely to generate significant social benefits through disease prevention, \nimproved health risk management, and greater health awareness. Bangladesh could suffer \nsignificant economic impacts as a result of COVID-19 (para. 9 and 10). If unchecked, the \npandemic could overwhelm the health system, which, in its present state, is unable to cope with \nthe increased need for intensive care, protective equipment, and human resources. COVID-19 \naffects economic activity through various channels, such as declines in domestic consumption, \nproduction, investment, and trade. In the short to medium run, it leads to higher unemployment \nand disruption of schooling, and to an increase in deaths and morbidities, all of which could have \na debilitating effect on the country\u2019s human capital. The project outputs are expected to prevent \nthe loss of human capital and address short-term gaps in the health system. Due to the short \nprocessing time available for the emergency response, economic due diligence following ADB \nguidelines on economic analysis33 will be conducted during project implementation. The ADB \nRETA34  will  include  resources  to  undertake  the  necessary  project  economic  analysis,  in \ncompliance with ADB requirements. \n \n \n33  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n34  ADB. Forthcoming. Support to Address Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019  and Strengthen Health Systems \nPreparedness for Communicable Disease in South Asia. Manila (under preparation).\n ", "10   \n30.  The project\u2019s outcome and outputs\u2014such as disease prevention and control\u2014are public \ngoods with positive externalities, with no opportunity for cost recovery; hence no financial viability \nassessment is required. Regarding the financial sustainability, about 64% of project cost will be \nutilized to procure emergency equipment, which will be discarded after use. About 30% will be \ninvested in infrastructure and facilities, which will either be dismantled after the emergency (such \nas screening facilities at airport and ports) or repurposed for use in hospitals (such as isolation \nwards). To ensure the project\u2019s sustainability, the government will provide assurances as part of \nthe loan agreement that (i) adequate budget support for incremental operations and maintenance \nis provided to the respective entities, and (ii) all entities receiving project equipment will maintain \nsound asset management practices, including an asset register, and conduct periodic inventories. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  A financial management assessment, conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines, \nfound that DGHS and MOHFW have adequate financial management arrangements in place to \nimplement  the  project.  The  financial  management  risk  is  rated  substantial,  because  of \nweaknesses in country financial management systems, capacity constraints of the implementing \nagency, and the project\u2019s urgent nature. These risks will be mitigated by (i) assigning dedicated \nand qualified financial management staff to the PIU; (ii) providing training in ADB\u2019s procedures \nand systems; (iii) requiring comprehensive financial information in quarterly progress reports; and \n(iv) assigning an internal auditor to the project. Furthermore, a financial management expert will \nbe funded by the ADB RETA (footnote 34) to support the project during the first 6 months. The \nproject  will  maintain  separate  books  of  account  in  accordance  with  accounting  standards \nacceptable to ADB, and the project financial statement will be audited annually by an independent \nauditor acceptable to ADB and in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. \n \n32.  A procurement assessment of the executing and implementing agencies, conducted for \nthe project, revealed that the procurement and contract management risk is high but manageable \nby implementing the agreed mitigation measures, such as (i) deploying PIU staff with prior ADB \nproject  experience;  (ii)  introducing  an  efficient contract  award  and  contract  implementation \nmanagement plan; (iii) applying the e-Government Procurement (e-GP) process; (iv) conducting \nfrequent and close monitoring, audits, and reviews; and (v) ensuring close supervision of and \nadequate mechanisms for the distribution of goods and equipment through credible agencies. \nProcurement experts funded by the ADB RETA (footnote 34) will provide capacity building support \nto ensure compliance with the agreed procurement procedures. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOHFW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 32). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The project will benefit all, especially the poor and vulnerable, by preventing or mitigating \nthe impact of infectious disease (para. 10) and providing inclusive healthcare services, health \neducation and awareness raising. Disease prevention benefits especially the poor, through \nreduced out-of-pocket expenditures, reduced absenteeism at work, and improved well-being. \nWomen and their health will need special attention, in the cultural context of Bangladesh, since \nthe burden of enforcing family hygiene and caring for the sick falls largely on them. Female health \nworkers and patients have specific needs related to menstrual hygiene, personal safety, and \ntransportation. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action \nplan was prepared. The key activities involve: (i) a gender sensitive communication strategy, and \n ", "11 \ncommunity education and mobilization (Output 3); (ii) targets for women for recruitment and \ncapacity building (Output 3) and gender-segregated isolation units (Output 2).  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.   The safeguards requirements for emergency assistance set out in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) have been followed. The screening and assessment of sites will be \nundertaken during project implementation in accordance with the environmental assessment and \nreview framework and the resettlement and indigenous peoples planning framework (RIPPF). The \nsafeguards  frameworks  have  been  designed  to  respond  to  the  exceptional  nature  of  the \nemergency and the challenges imposed by COVID-19 on meeting safeguards requirements, such \nas audits and consultations. The frameworks are broad enough to address (i) impacts and risks \nidentified at a later stage; and (ii) any change of scope required by the rapidly evolving situation, \nwhile ensuring continued compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. In view of the limited \ncapacity, safeguards consultants engaged under this loan will provide support.  \n \n36.  Environment (category B). Most civil and structural works will consist of rehabilitation or \nminor extensions to buildings on existing premises, so potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and \ninduced impacts of the project are anticipated to be site-specific and minor, and few (if any) to be \nirreversible in nature. The main impacts and risks relate to (i) medical waste management, \nrequiring  environmentally  sound  and  safe  handling,  storage,  transport,  and  disposal;  (ii) \noccupational and community health and safety risks35 associated with the construction and \noperation of project-supported facilities and the high contagiousness of COVID-19; and (iii) \nconstruction-related pollution, disruption, and disturbance. The environmental assessment and \nreview framework provides guidance on mitigation of these impacts, through the development of \nguidelines on waste management, health and safety risk assessment, and management plans, \nEnvironmental  Code  of  Practices,  provision  of  PPE,  and  trainings.  The  implementation  of \nEnvironmental Management Plans shall be closely supervised and monitored. Specific project \nfunding has been dedicated to medical waste management, the provision of PPE, health and \nsafety trainings, and the mitigation of other environmental problems. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Involuntary resettlement is not expected to occur \nunder this project since the works will be carried out within existing facilities on government land. \nHowever, to cater to emerging issues during implementation,36 the RIPPF includes site selection \ncriteria and guidelines. For existing facilities, a rapid audit to assess any legacy issues or risks \nrelated to involuntary resettlement will be undertaken. If such issues are identified, a corrective \naction plan will be developed and implemented. The RIPPF and the project administration manual \ninclude involuntary resettlement screening and audit guidelines. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category B). No adverse impact on indigenous peoples37 or small \nethnic communities is expected; however, while most facility sites are unknown at this stage, \nindigenous people will be among the project beneficiaries. The project is thus rated category B \nand the RIPPF includes site selection criteria to this effect. Communication activities will be \n \n35  For health workers, laboratory technicians, medical waste handlers, contractor and construction workers, patients and \nvisitors to existing facilities, and the wider local communities in the event of inadequate waste management processes.   \n36  The RIPPF anticipates issues that may arise during implementation, such as, if squatters are found, or if, for example, the \nhealth situation requires more isolation room, which could require more ground than initially expected. \n37  For operational purposes, the term Indigenous Peoples is used in a generic sense to refer to a distinct, vulnerable, social \nand cultural group as defined in SPS 2009. In considering these characteristics, national legislation, customary law, and \nany international conventions to which the country is a party will be taken into account. The Constitution of Bangladesh \nrefer to ethnic communities as Small Ethnic Communities. Both the terms have been used in related documentation. \n ", "12   \npresented in culturally appropriate ways for indigenous peoples. Any risk of exclusion from access \nto information and services for indigenous communities and other vulnerable and disadvantaged \ngroups will be addressed through the indigenous peoples plan. \n \nF.
