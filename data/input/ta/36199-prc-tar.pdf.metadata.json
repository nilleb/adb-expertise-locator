INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  At the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) included a proposed technical assistance (TA) for enforcing World \nTrade Organization (WTO) rules by the judicial system in its 2002 country assistance plan for \nthe  PRC.  The  ADB  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Beijing  from  21  to  28  May  2002  for  the \nproposed TA and reached an understanding with the Supreme People\u2019s Court (SPC) and \nNational Judges College (NJC) on the objectives, scope, terms of reference for consultants, \ncost and financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 The TA framework is \nattached as Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n2.  The PRC became a WTO member in December 2001. As a new member, the PRC is \ncommitted to adjusting its legal and judicial system to comply with WTO rules and requirements. \nAll core WTO agreements, i.e., General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, paragraph \n3(b), Article X)2, Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS, \nArticle 41(4)), and General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS, Article VI(2)), require its \nmembers to establish independent judicial or administrative tribunals and procedures to review \nthe  administrative  or  other  tribunals\u2019  actions  or  decisions  on  disputes  related  to  trade, \nintellectual property protection, and trade of services and, where justified, to provide remedies to \nthe injured party.   \n \n3.  To satisfy this WTO requirement, the Government decided that such a review function \nshould be performed through a mechanism to be set up in the PRC court system. The process \nof review by the courts of the actions and decisions made by the executive or administrative  \nagency is known as judicial review.3 In the PRC context, decisions or actions of the PRC \nadministrative  authorities  in  connection  with  WTO  rules  and  their  implementation,  and \ninvestigations in connection with, or decisions made on antidumping, subsidy, and safeguard \ncases by the State Economics and Trade Commission (SETC) and/or Ministry of Foreign Trade \nand Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), would be subject to review by the court in accordance \nwith law. Establishing this process will substantially expand the role of judicial system and \nstrengthen the rule of law. \n \n4.   The PRC court system is faced with two major challenges in establishing such a judicial \nreview mechanism. A series of legal and institutional issues will need to be appropriately \naddressed, and the capacity of the court system in conducting judicial review functions for \nWTO-related matters will need to be strengthened.  \n \n5.  The PRC judicial system comprises SPC; 31 high people\u2019s courts with one in each \nprovince,  autonomous  region,  or  municipality  directly  under  the  central  Government;  346 \nintermediate people\u2019s courts in provinces and municipalities at the level above the prefectures \nand municipal level cities; 3,135 primary people\u2019s courts in counties and county-level cities; and \nseveral special people\u2019s courts such as military, maritime, and railway transportation courts.   \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 2002. \n2  The same requirement is repeated in other WTO agreements relating to GATT, such as Article 13 of the \nAgreement on Implementation of Article VI of GATT, Article 11 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of \nGATT and Article 23 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. \n3  Judicial review may also mean review by a higher level court of the decisions made by a lower level court. This TA, \nhowever, will focus on the review by judicial system of the administrative decisions or actions. ", "2   \n6.  In dealing with the cases, the PRC court system takes the second instance decision as \nthe final one. The jurisdiction of hearing and deciding the first and the second instance cases by \nthe different levels of people\u2019s courts are determined according to the applicable procedural law \nand SPC\u2019s decisions.  If a litigant does not accept the judgments or decisions made by the local \npeople\u2019s courts or special people\u2019s courts in the first instance, the litigant has the right to appeal \nto the next higher level people\u2019s courts. In criminal cases, the procuratorates (e.g., public \nprosecutors or district attorneys) may file protests to the next higher level people\u2019s courts if they \nwould not accept the judgments and decisions made in the first instance.  \n \n7.  The trial of cases by courts follow either of the three procedural laws, i.e., Criminal  \nProcedure  Law,  Civil  Procedure  Law,  or  Administrative  Litigation  Procedure  Law.  The \nsubstantive law applied in trials by PRC courts are mainly domestic law, including laws adopted \nto give effect to the international treaties. In principle, when the domestic law conflicts with \ninternational treaties acceded to by the PRC, the provisions of international treaties should \napply (Article 142 of General Principles of Civil Code and Article 238 of Civil Procedure Law). \nThis implies that in the absence of domestic laws, the provisions of international treaties may be \napplied directly in the PRC courts.  \n \n8.  In addition to such litigation procedures, there is a judicial supervision procedure. Under \nthis procedure, where manifest errors are found in the judgments or decisions, the presidents of \nthe various levels of the people\u2019s courts have the authority to order the judging courts under \ntheir leadership to retry the cases for which judgments or decisions have taken legal effect; SPC \nhas the authority to order various levels of the people\u2019s courts to retry such cases; the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Procuratorates and various levels of people\u2019s procuratorates may request the courts to \nretry such cases; and the concerned litigants or their close relatives may apply or petition for \nretrial of such cases. \n \n9.  The PRC has made many adjustments in its legislative, administrative, and judicial \nsystem to satisfy WTO requirements. To ensure that the WTO\u2019s nondiscrimination principle is \nmet in the judicial process, SPC issued an order that took effect on 1 March 2002 to elevate the \njurisdiction over commercial cases from the primary courts to the higher level of courts. The \norder specifies that only the high courts, intermediate courts in municipalities at the provincial \nlevel,  intermediate  courts  in  provincial  and  autonomous  regions\u2019  capital  cities  and  special \neconomic zones, and certain courts in economically more developed cities would have the \njurisdiction to hear and decide commercial cases involving foreigners. This step was taken to \nhelp ensure the impartiality of the courts and maintain  higher professional standards of  the \njudicial system in foreign-related commercial cases.  \n \n10.  In response to the WTO requirement of setting up an independent adjudication body to \nhear and decide administrative decisions or actions, in August 2002, SPC issued the Regulation \non Trial of Administrative Cases Involving International Trade. The regulation provides that the \nfollowing cases will be tried by the courts at the intermediate level or above. In accordance with \nthe  Administrative  Litigation  Procedure  Law,  the  courts  are  accorded  jurisdiction  over \nadministrative cases involving (i) international trade of goods, (ii) international trade of services, \n(iii) international trade related intellectual property protection, and (iv) other international trade. \nThe regulation also provides, in accordance with normal judicial review principles, that  trial by \nthe courts will focus on (i) the authenticity and accuracy of evidence, (ii) correct application of \nlaws and regulations, (iii) violation of legal procedure, (iv) exceeding the delegated authority, (v) \nabuse of authority or power, (vi) fairness of administrative penalty, and (vii)  nonperformance or \ndelay of performance of legally designated functions. While the regulation provides that the \napplicable law should be domestic law, it also emphasizes that in a conflict between two ", "  3\ninterpretations of a provision in domestic law, the interpretation consistent with the international \ntreaties should prevail.  \n \n11.  Introducing judicial review into the PRC court system raises a series of issues relating to \njurisdiction, procedural law, applicable law, and relationship between judicial and administrative \nbranches. For example, (i) Should an international trade court be established for WTO-rule-\nrelated cases or should these cases be handled by the existing courts? (ii) Should there be one \nor a limited number of courts at an appropriate level to hear and decide these cases or will all of \nthe courts at this level be given the jurisdiction for such cases? (iii) Should the first instance \ndecision in the judicial review process be the final decision or should there be a chance of \nsubmission to an appellate court and which would be this appellate court? (iv) What would be \nthe applicable procedural law? (v) To what extent should the court limit its role to deciding on \nthe application of law or may it make determination about the facts? (vi) Should the substantive \nlaw applied by the courts be the domestic law only or should it include international treaties in \nrespect to WTO rules? (vii) How should decisions be implemented? (viii) Who should make \njudgments on cases involving foreign policy matters, and the relationship between the judicial \nand administrative branches on these matters? \n \n12.  The second big challenge for the PRC court system is that the judges are not fully \nequipped with professional knowledge about WTO and its rules. The judges have been trained \nmainly in domestic laws and the laws applied by them in most cases are domestic laws. Upon \nentry into WTO, the PRC has amended a larger number of existing legislation and adopted a \nnumber of new laws to comply with WTO requirements.4 The issue of application of domestic \nlaw or international treaties when they are in conflict would further complicate the trial process. \nThere is an urgent need to train the senior judges (i.e., the presidents and vice presidents of the \nintermediate courts or above) who will sit in the courts with jurisdiction to carry out judicial \nreview of the WTO-rule-related cases.  \n \n13.  In the long-term, the PRC court system needs to develop its own capacity to train senior \njudges in this area. NJC is directly under SPC and provides legal training for senior judges. The \nmainstream curricula of NJC focus on traditional domestic legal areas, such as criminal, civil, \nadministrative and procedural laws. NJC has been providing training in foreign-related economic \nlaws, but with emphasis on the domestic laws in connection with foreign trade and investment. \nNJC has not had a systemic curriculum on WTO and its rules or the domestic legislation \nadopted in compliance with WTO rules. Its faculty is not able to provide a comprehensive \ntraining suitable for senior judges on WTO rules. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The TA will help the PRC\u2019s judicial system meet WTO requirements in independent \nreviews of decisions made and/or actions taken by the administrative authorities pertinent to \nenforcement of WTO rules in the PRC.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Including adoption of regulations on import and export of goods, antidumping, subsidies and countervailing duties \nand safeguards in December 2001 when the PRC\u2019s WTO membership took effect. The PRC received assistance \nduring their preparation and finalization under ADB funded technical assistance for WTO Membership and Foreign \nTrade Law Reform (TA 3762-PRC, approved for $700,000 in June 2001). ", "4   \n15.  The TA will assist SPC and NJC to (i) develop the capacity of the judicial system to \nreview decisions or actions of administrative authorities on cases relating to  WTO rules, by \nequipping  senior  judges  with  knowledge  of  WTO  rules  and  relevant  domestic  laws  and \nsupporting long-term training capacity of NJC in this area; and (ii) improve the judicial review \nmechanism by studying international experience. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n16.  The capacity strengthening will be carried out through training courses for the senior \njudges  who  will  hear  and  decide  the  WTO-related  cases  and  by  strengthening  NJC\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity in conducting and/or organizing training in the WTO areas. Under the \nsenior judges training program supported by the TA, several batches of senior judges will be \ntrained in WTO rules and related domestic laws and regulations. The training program will help \nthe PRC court system respond promptly to enforce WTO obligations.  \n \n17.  The TA will help NJC develop its capacity in teaching and researching on WTO rules \nand enable it to carry out similar training in future by (i) developing and transferring the training \ncurricula to NJC, (ii) collecting and compiling research materials, (iii) providing a limited amount \nof equipment, (iv) providing training to NJC faculty and other experts, and (v) involving NJC\u2019s \nfaculty members and out-sourced domestic experts in the conduct of training courses with the \ninternational consultants. \n \n18.  The assistance for establishing the judicial review function in the PRC judicial system will \nbe provided through research on aspect of the judicial review by SPC judges or officials and \nNJC faculty members at a foreign research or educational institution, a workshop identifying and \ndiscussing the issues relating to the judicial review, a comparative study of the judicial review \nsystems in other major WTO member countries, and an international symposium on judicial \nreview.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is $533,000 equivalent, including $321,000 in foreign currency \ncost and $212,000 equivalent in the local currency cost.  ADB will provide $400,000 on a grant \nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to finance the total \nforeign currency cost and $79,000 equivalent of the local currency cost.  The funds provided by \nADB will finance the international and domestic consulting services; resource persons and \ndistinguished speakers; part of the costs related to training, workshops, and the international \nsymposium;  equipment;  external  study;  materials  for  comparative  study;  and  other \nadministrative and office requirements.  The Government\u2019s contribution of $133,000 equivalent \nwill cover the costs of counterpart staff; office accommodation for international and domestic \nconsultants; accommodation and per diem of trainees, local communications and transportation; \ninterpretation and translation; venue for, organization of, and administration of training courses, \nworkshops, and the international symposium; and general administration. The detailed costs \nand financing are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  Services of international (6 person-months) and domestic (5 person-months) consultants \nwill be required for the training. The consultants should have  experience in preparing curricula \nand conducting training for judges, senior government officials, and lawyers in the following \nareas: (i) general background about GATT and WTO, including, among others, their history, ", "  5\nstructure, major agreements, major rounds of global trade negotiations and results, manner and \napproach of trade negotiations, and dispute settlement mechanisms; (ii) rules of GATT, with \nparticular attention to the rules on nontariff barriers, such as customs valuation, rules of origin, \nand technical barriers; (iii) WTO agreements and domestic law on antidumping, subsidy and \ncountervailing duties, and safeguard measures; (iv) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \nIntellectual Property Rights rules and international and domestic law on protection of intellectual \nproperty rights; (v) status of global negotiations under General Agreement on Trade in Service  \nand the PRC\u2019s WTO entry commitments to opening the domestic service sectors; and (vi) \nexperience of foreign countries\u2019 courts in carrying out judicial review functions. The outline terms \nof reference for the consultants are attached as Appendix 3. A firm of international consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants. The \ninternational consultants will associate with the domestic consultants to be engaged through \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. The detailed curricula package, duration of one training \nsession, and how many training sessions to be provided will be finalized during the inception \nmission. Therefore, the training consultants will be engaged using quality- and cost-based \nselection method. As the methodology and terms of reference are straightforward and clear, the \ntraining consultants will be selected on the basis of the simplified technical proposal procedure. \nThe individual domestic consultants (2 person-months) will carry out a comparative study on \njudicial review system and will be engaged separately in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. International and domestic speakers will be invited to make presentations at the \nsymposium on the experience of judicial review. The equipment to be provided for organizing of \ntraining courses and producing training materials will be procured by NJC in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.    An  advance  payment  facility  will  be  provided  for  the \nexternal study, equipment purchase, training, workshops, and international symposium.   \n \n21.  SPC will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  A vice president of SPC will have overall \nresponsibility for TA implementation. A leading group will be set up in SPC, headed by a project \ndirector who should be a senior official from the Foreign Affairs Bureau of SPC.  NJC will be the \nImplementing Agency.  A project office will be set up in NJC, led by a vice president of NJC. \nSPC  should  coordinate  with  other  relevant  Government  agencies  in  implementing  the  TA, \nparticularly  with  State  Economics  and  Trade  Commission,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade  and \nEconomic Cooperation, Customs General Administration, Administration of Inspection of Goods, \nOffice of Legislative Affairs of the State Council, and Legislative Affairs Commission of the \nNational People\u2019s Congress.   \n \n22.  The  implementation  of  the  TA  is  expected  to  commence  in  March  2003  and  be \ncompleted in June 2004.  Within 3 months of the commencement of TA implementation, the \nconsultants are expected to finalize the curriculum of training. Then the consultants will deliver \nseveral training sessions for the senior judges selected by SPC and NJC and NJC faculty \nmembers. At the conclusion of the training, the consultants will prepare, together with NJC, a \nbrief assessment of the training results and submit the results to ADB and NJC.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $400,000  for  the  purpose  of  the \nEnforcement of World Trade Organization Rules by the Judicial System, and hereby reports \nsuch action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \nAssist in compliance   \nwith World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) \nrequirements and \nstrengthening rule of \nlaw. \n \nPurpose       \nImprove judicial review  Development of  Technical Assistance (TA)  Issues relating to judicial \nfunction in connection  professional capability  review missions and TA  review are carefully studied \nwith WTO-rules-related  in trial of WTO-rules- completion report.  and appropriately handled \ncases.  related cases and  and right group of senior \n  development of judicial  judges have been selected \nreview system and  for training and are well \nfunction.  trained.  \nOutputs       \n(i) Senior judges   Improved performance  Assessment of the results  Suitably qualified \ntrained in WTO rules.  of the senior judges in  of training with assistance  consultants are available \n  judicial review of the  of consultants.  and selected for training. \n  WTO-rules-related     \n  cases.     \n       \n(ii) National Judges  The capability of NJC to  Assessment with  The consultants succeed in \nCollege (NJC)   conduct all or part of  assistance of consultants  transferring the necessary \nstrengthened in  the core courses on  of the improvement of  knowledge to NJC faculty \ndelivering future  WTO rules will be  NJC\u2019s capacity to provide  and NJC faculty endeavors \ntraining on WTO rules.  strengthened.  all or part of the training on  to improve capacity to \n    WTO rules.  organize and provide such \n      training. \n       \n(iii)  Issues relating to  Research on issues  TA review and discussion  Failure to identify important \njudicial review being  associated with  with Supreme People\u2019s  issues and carry out in-depth \nstudied and foreign  development judicial  Court (SPC) and NJC.  study; less-than-satisfactory \nexperiences being  review system have  exchange of foreign \nexchanged.   been conducted and  experience. \n  the system has been \nimproved. \nActivities       \n(i) Training courses for  Number of senior  Consultants\u2019 reports. \nsenior judges.   judges who have   \n  trained and improved   \n  knowledge of these   \n  judges on WTO and its   \nrules.
