INTRODUCTION \n1.  The finance sector strategy of the Government of the Philippines is anchored in the \nPhilippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016.1 Reforms are to deepen the financial system through \nthe balanced development of banking and capital markets.2 To achieve these objectives, the \ngovernment  adopted  a  revised  capital  market  development  blueprint  for  2011\u20132016.  This \nblueprint includes a wide range of initiatives including sequenced steps to increase liquidity in \nthe government bond market including the creation of market makers and the launch of an \ninterdealer repo market with a master agreement.3 To complement these activities, the blueprint \nidentifies efforts to strengthen the clearing and settlement system, including a more definitive \nframework for close-out netting.4 The government has asked the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to support this work.5 The TA is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 for the Philippines and efforts to strengthen \ngovernance and reduce corruption through legal and regulatory reforms in budget execution and \nreporting.6 It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Budget  execution  continues  to  be  less  than  optimal,  with  under-utilization  rates \naveraging  approximately  15%  since  at  least  2004. 8  Poorly  developed  public  financial \nmanagement  along  with  the  underdeveloped  debt  issuance  process  of  the  Bureau  of  the \nTreasury  (BTr)  have  adversely  affected  government  efforts  to  support  infrastructure \ndevelopment and deliver social programs as envisioned in the Social Contract with the Filipino \nPeople (footnote 1). These issues have also produced explicit and substantial costs beyond \ninefficient budget execution. When coupled with an extremely complex and unpredictable set of \nbudget disbursement procedures, individual government entities have developed a practice of \nmaintaining  unauthorized,  off-budget  and  possibly  unaudited  cash  accounts  to  smooth \nexpenditures.9 Government entities maintaining on-budget, high balance and high turn-over \naccounts are required to place their deposits in commercial banks, which do not provide any \nremuneration to BTr. These on- and off-budget accounts divert much-needed resources from \nthe government, necessitate the over-issuance of government debt to provide a cushion against \nunreliable cash flow forecasts, and are prone to misuse. In addition, the level of government \n                                                \n1  Government of the Philippines. National Economic and Development Authority. 2011. Philippine Development \nPlan, 2011\u20132016. Manila. http://www.neda.gov.ph/PDP/2011-2016/default.asp   \n2  Cross-cutting themes include the provision of an enabling environment, progressive adoption of international \nstandards and best practices, and good governance and transparency. \n3  A \u201cmarket maker\u201d is a broker-dealer firm that accepts the risk of holding a certain number of shares of a particular \nsecurity in order to facilitate trading in that security. Each market maker competes for customer order flow by \ndisplaying firm offers to buy and sell a particular security. Once an order is received, the market maker immediately \nsells from its own inventory or seeks an offsetting order. This process takes place in mere seconds. \n4  Closeout netting reduces pre-settlement risk if counterparties have multiple offsetting obligations to one another. \n(e.g multiple interest rate swaps or foreign exchange forward contracts). The parties agree to accomplish this by \nagreeing to net those obligations. In the event that a counterparty defaults, or some other termination event occurs, \nthe outstanding contracts are all terminated. They are marked to market and settled with a net payment. This \ntechnique eliminates \"cherry picking\" whereby a defaulting counterparty fails to make payment on its obligations, \nbut is legally entitled to collect on the obligations owed to it. \n5  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n7   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 August 2014. \n8  Government of Australia. 2013. Implementing the Treasury Single Account in the Philippines: Report on the \nFunctional Review. Manila. \n9  Estimates  indicate  that  BTr,  government-owned  and  -controlled  corporations,  government  agencies,  special \ninstitutions, and local government units have opened approximately 170,000 bank accounts; and the three largest \ngovernment-owned and -controlled banks alone hold P500 billion of public entity cash deposits. \n ", "2 \n \ndebt  has  been  inflated  by  a  legally  mandated  bond-sinking  fund.10 This  fund  produces  a \nnegative carry of approximately 2%, or P20 billion per year, as proceeds are invested largely in \nlow-yielding bank accounts.11 Finally, the excess liquidity in the financial system produced by \nthese inefficiencies must be routinely removed, which places a significant strain on the central \nbank.12  \n \n3.  The  primary  government  debt  issuance  practices  of  BTr,  while  improved,  remain \ninefficient and relatively costly as evidenced by the lack of liquidity. The government bond \nmarket remains fragmented. The number of primary dealers at 37 is too high, which transforms \nthe  process  into  a  private  placement  format.  The  secondary  government  bond  market  is \ncharacterized by a near absence of two-way price quotes as potential market-makers lack the \nnecessary inventory management tools, such as repos and interest rate derivatives. In essence, \npresumptive market makers are unable to take short positions to hedge their long positions. As \na result, liquidity in the government bond market is far below what would be expected in a \ncountry with an investment-grade credit rating. A risk-free yield curve has yet to develop as \ninfrequently traded securities provide unreliable prices and yields at key maturity points. A \nreliable short-term reference rate has yet to be developed. Bid\u2013ask spreads for \u201con-the-run\u201d \nsecurities are among the lowest in the region but the standard deviation of the sample is the \nhighest and average lot sizes among the lowest. Bid\u2013ask spreads for \u201coff-the-run\u201d securities are \namong the widest.13 \n \n4.  Ongoing enhancements to public financial management. To address poor budget \nexecution and forecasting, the Philippines adopted the Philippine Public Financial Management \nRoadmap in February 2011. This road map provides a whole-of-government approach that \nproposes to clarify, simplify, and harmonize the financial management process and related \ninformation systems. Australia has committed A$30 million to the Philippines\u2013Australia Public \nFinancial Management Program over 5 years to support this reform effort.14 The program has \nfour primary objectives: (i) increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the allocation, utilization, \nand  reporting  of  budgeted  funds  by  oversight  agencies;  (ii)  improve  public  financial \nmanagement  capability  in  select  departments;  (iii)  generate  more  timely,  reliable,  and \naccessible public expenditure management information; and (iv) strengthen external oversight \nof public expenditure management linked to physical performance information. A key phase of \nthis reform has focused on strengthening the government\u2019s cash forecasting and management \nsystems, including the creation of a treasury single account. In conjunction with this effort, and \nas a prelude to this larger TA, ADB funded a small-scale TA project to provide urgently needed \nancillary support to strengthen BTr\u2019s systems and capacity.15  \n \n5.  These  two  projects  together  have  produced  several  key  milestones.  A  program \nmanagement  office  was  established  in  2012  to  ensure  interagency  cooperation.  A  new \nharmonized budget classification and unified account code structure was developed, and a \n                                                \n10 Republic Act 1000 of 1954 mandated the establishment of a bond sinking fund at a sufficient level to redeem at \nmaturity the bonds issued under the provision of law. The act stipulated that the fund shall receive 10% of all \nmedium and long-term issues of domestic government securities. \n11 This fund approximates 8% of gross domestic product and 20% of all outstanding government debt. \n12 The Philippine Star. 2013.

Manila.  \n14 The program is assisting the Philippine government to implement its Philippine Public Financial Management \nReform Roadmap: Towards Improved Accountability and Transparency, 2011\u20132015. This comprehensive public \nfinancial management reform agenda aims to clarify, simplify, improve, and harmonize the financial management \nprocesses and information systems of the civil service. The program commenced in October 2011. \n15 ADB.  2013.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  Strengthening  Treasury\u2019s  Liquidity \nManagement. Manila. \n ", "3 \n \npublic financial management competency framework is being pilot tested. Expenditure agents \nhave strengthened their internal controls, and managers and internal auditors from national \ngovernment agencies are being trained to utilize the newly developed Philippine government \ninternal audit manual. The government-integrated financial management information system is \nbeing developed with notable progress recorded by the recent launch of a treasury single \naccount and introduction of commercial terms for government deposits.16 ADB\u2019s small-scale TA \nconcurrently strengthened BTr\u2019s operations and technical capacity and in the process produced \nthe following outputs: (i) implementation of a revised organization structure; (ii) implementation \nof revised duties and job descriptions, and a mechanism for screening prospective new staff;  \n(iii)  creation  of  a  dealing  room  with  formal  process  flows,  approval  limits,  and  asset \nmanagement guidelines; (iv) a diagnostic of the repo market and instruments; and (v) enhanced \ncapacity.  \n \n6.  Completing the reform agenda. BTr urgently requires additional capacity development \ngiven ongoing staff retirements and increase in newly hired staff. In addition, the ongoing \nreorganization has created new highly technical positions, and enhanced the job descriptions of \nexisting positions. BTr expects its market professionals to develop more direct relationships with \nthe  government\u2019s  trading  partners  and  to  build  relationships  with  the  investor  community. \nMoreover, improved budget forecasting and execution will enable BTr to more accurately plan \nand execute its borrowing programs, while reducing the relative cost of issuance. However, the \nprimary and secondary government debt markets need to be strengthened. Participation in \nprimary  auctions  should  carry  responsibilities  and  access  to  privileges  with  new  issuance \nfocusing  on  identified  benchmark  securities  to enhance  market  liquidity  and  improve  price \ndiscovery. Linkages to capital market development efforts must be enhanced to provide a deep \nand efficient short-term debt market through which BTr can deploy its excess short-term funds. \nFor  example,  many  of  the  initiatives  supported  by  this  TA  compliment  activities  being \nundertaken under a separate ADB-funded TA.17 They include support to refine and implement \nthe capital market development blueprint, the development of capacity in nonbank financial \nregulators, efforts to enhance demand for capital market instruments, and preliminary support to \nintroduce a short-term debt market anchored on a master repurchase agreement.  \n \n7.  The TA is also being coordinated with an International Monetary Fund-led diagnostic of \nthe government debt market. This diagnostic, to which ADB contributed, includes a blueprint \nand timelines to improve the government debt market. This blueprint serves as a template for \ncoordination between ADB, the International Monetary Fund, and the United States Treasury. In \neffect, the US Treasury will provide a resident advisor to strengthen the primary dealer system, \nwhile ADB will provide technical assistance to enhance BTr\u2019s infrastructure, while at the same \ntime providing significant capacity development. In addition, ADB will support efforts to develop \nthe capital market.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA has three objectives: (i) address the government\u2019s immediate need to continue \nenhancing BTr\u2019s technical capacity for core treasury operations (e.g., issuance and support \noperations), including investment, debt portfolio, and risk management; (ii) work in conjunction \nand coordination with the US Treasury resident advisor program to rationalize and improve the \nprimary dealer system, leading to lower relative costs of issuance; and (iii) address several key \n                                                \n16 The development of the government integrated financial management information system and the creation of a \ntreasury single account are both supported by Executive Order 55, issued September 2011. \n17 ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "4 \n \ncapital market development constraints including the development of a range of short-term \ninvestment alternatives for BTr\u2019s idle cash balances. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  impact  will  be  more  cost-effective  utilization  of  the  government\u2019s  fiscal \nresources. The impact will be brought about through a culmination of reforms leading to a \nreduction  in  the  relative  cost  of  issuing  and  administering  government  debt  and  in  turn, \nincreasing the fiscal resources available to alternative and higher priority uses. The outcome will \nbe enhanced efficiency of primary and secondary government debt markets.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Debt  and  cash  management  functions  enhanced.  BTr\u2019s  immediate \noperating capacity will be developed by directly supporting key functions in the front and middle \noffices. The TA will continue ongoing support to develop BTr\u2019s trading desk to strengthen its \ncapacity to manage investable cash and to execute broader asset management strategies. \nActivities  will  include  the  development  of  physical  infrastructure;  direct  training  of  staff; \nestablishment of monitoring and performance management systems; and strengthening of BTr\u2019s \nmiddle office and the requisite monitoring, risk management, limits, and reporting structures. \n11.  Output  2:  Primary  dealer  system  strengthened.  To  ensure  BTr\u2019s  underlying \ninfrastructure can sustain the ongoing reforms, the TA will (i) assess and review BTr\u2019s auction \nsystem and provide recommendations for improvement and/or replacement; (ii) assess and \nreview BTr\u2019s scriptless registry with recommendations for improvement and/or replacement;  \n(iii)  assess  BTr\u2019s  internal  treasury  management  system  and  provide  recommendations  for \nimprovement  (related  \u201cequipment\u201d  budget  of  $40,000);  and  (iv)  enhance  BTr\u2019s  capacity. \nKnowledge products on a variety of topics to be finalized during TA implementation.18 They will \nhelp  build  stakeholder  consensus  for  the  proposed  reforms.  If  necessary,  an  independent \nnational expert will be retained to administer this component and to develop the terms of \nreference.  \n12.  Output 3: Development of capital market enhanced. The TA will (i) prepare a road \nmap to eliminate bifurcation between taxable and tax-exempt investors; (ii) continue support for \nthe introduction of the global master repurchase agreement or equivalent, thereby eliminating \nthe  documentary  stamp  tax  issue  and fostering the  development  of a  repurchase market;  \n(iii) launch a platform for securities borrowing and lending, including the conditions necessary to \nincorporate  the  contractual  savings  sector;  and  (iv)  enhance  BTr\u2019s  capacity.  Knowledge \nproducts, covering a variety of topics to be finalized during TA implementation,19  will be used to \nbuild  stakeholder  consensus  to  support  capital  market  development.  If  necessary,  an \nindependent national expert will be retained to administer this component and to develop the \nterms of reference.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n18 The preliminary list of knowledge products has been agreed as follows: a contrast between multiple- and single-\nprice auctions, development of benchmark securities and yield curves, conduct of switch auctions, and primary \ndealer liquidity facilities. \n19 The preliminary list of knowledge products has been agreed as follows: Separate Trading of Registered Interest \nand Principal of Securities, inflation-linked bonds, catastrophe bonds, and retail treasury bonds. \n ", "5 \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies,  secretarial  assistance,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n14.  BTr will be the executing and implementing agency. The TA will be implemented from  \n1 November 2014 to 30 October 2016. TA monitoring and evaluation will be based on actual \nresults compared with performance targets (the design and monitoring framework). TA review \nmissions will be frequent to ensure TA completion within the projected timelines. TA inception \nand completion reports will be supplemented with periodic progress reports.  \n \n15.  To attract the most-qualified experts and to recognize the uncertainties associated with \nsome innovative TA delivery, the packaging of the consulting services may involve one or \nseveral packages and a combination of firms and individuals. For those specifically identified \nengagements, market testing and discussions with BTr will confirm the appropriate packaging \nprior to soliciting expressions of interest. ADB will engage consulting firms through quality- and \ncost-based selection (80:20), according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  the  individual \nconsultant selection method in accordance with the consulting guidelines. Procurement, if any, \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). A total of 14 person-months will be allocated to national consultants to support \nenhancements to asset management and risk management; 4 person-months will be allocated \nto international consultants to evaluate BTr\u2019s infrastructure and systems; and 3.6 person-months \nwill  be  allocated  to  national  consultants  to  research,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  the \nproduction  of  knowledge  products.  A  fixed  sum  of  $25,000  will  be  allocated  to  provide \ncontinuing support  to  developing  a repo market.  A  budget  of  $40,000  is  reserved for the \npurchase of information technology-related equipment, which will be donated to BTr upon TA \ncompletion. Outline terms of reference are presented in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the \nTA will conform with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nStrengthening Treasury Operations and Capital Market Reform, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumptions \nMore cost-effective  Bid\u2013ask spreads on off- AsiaBondsOnline annual  Cooperation between \nutilization of the  the-run securities decline  liquidity survey  government agencies \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal  by 20% by 2016   remains high.  \n \nresources     \n \n(baseline 2014: 16.8 basis  Global market \n \npoints)  conditions remain \n \nconducive to issuance \n   \nand debt market \nGovernment bond  BTr internal reports \nreforms. \nfragmentation reduced by \n \n \n15% by 2016  \n \n  Risks \n \nVested interests are \n(baseline 2014: 105 \n \nresistant to reforms. \ntreasury issues)  \n \n   \n \nBTr\u2019s earnings on  BTr internal reports  The legal framework \ninvestable cash mirror the  requires significant \nHSBC Local Currency All  revision to support the \nBond Index   contemplated reforms. \n   \n(baseline 2014: no  The capacity and \nperformance mandate)  resources of BTr and \nOutcome      other regulatory \nEfficiency of the  Lower cost primary auction  BTr internal reports  agencies are not \nprimary and  methodology adopted by  Consultant reports  adequate to support \nsecondary  2016   implementation of the \n \ngovernment debt    reforms. \n \nmarkets enhanced   \n(baseline 2014: Dutch \nsingle-series auctions)    Contemplated reforms \ncannot be implemented \n   \nwithin the duration of \nBasic primary dealer  BTr internal reports \nthe TA. \nobligations, privileges, and  Consultant reports \noperating standards   \nintroduced by 2016  \n \n(baseline 2014: none) \nOutputs     \n1.

POVERTY IMPACT AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nReducing  poverty  and  eliminating  the  vulnerabilities  of  large  sections  of  the  population  remain  two  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s principal challenges. In the late 1980s, poverty rates in the Philippines were about half that of other \nSoutheast Asian countries. Since then, progress on poverty reduction has been slow, with an estimated poverty rate \n(headcount index) of 26.5% in 2009 (up from 24.9% in 2003), while 45% of the population is vulnerable to falling into \npoverty. \n \nSustaining high economic growth is the government\u2019s overarching response to achieving inclusive growth and \nthereby, a reduction in poverty. To support this initiative, the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 translates the \nSocial Contract with the Filipino People (SCFP) into three broad strategies: (i) attaining high, sustained economic \ngrowth through a stable macroeconomic environment, rapid growth of industry, investment in infrastructure; and \ncurbing corruption and enforcing the rule of law; (ii) providing equal access to development opportunities by investing \nin human capital, especially in education, health, and other basic social services; and ensuring equal opportunities by \nimproving access to infrastructure, credit, land, technology, and other productive inputs; and (iii) formulating effective \nsocial safety nets to ensure the protection and promotion of extremely vulnerable groups.a \n \nThe country partnership strategy, 2011-2016 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Philippines is based on \nthe intersection of Philippine Development Plan priorities with Strategy 2020, consistent with the needs of a lower-\nmiddle-income country.b To support the government\u2019s objective of high, inclusive, and sustainable growth, ADB will \nfocus on three core areas: infrastructure, environment, and education. However, ADB will also continue and deepen \nits efforts to strengthen governance and reduce corruption at the country, sector, and project levels. One of the main \npriorities for reform includes legal and regulatory reforms for budget execution and reporting. In effect, poorly \ndeveloped public financial management along with the underdeveloped debt issuance process of the Bureau of \nTreasury (BTr) and its inability to anticipate cash inflows and outflows have adversely affected government efforts to \nsupport infrastructure development and deliver social programs. By strengthening public financial management, and \nincreasing the linkages to existing ADB programs designed to deepen capital markets, the technical assistance (TA) \nwill increase efficiencies within BTr\u2019s funding operations. The resulting fiscal savings, which are potentially significant, \ncan then be redirected to support the SCFP\u2019s emphasis on human capital. In addition, by freeing up scarce \nresources, the TA can facilitate increased spending on infrastructure.  \n \nB.     Poverty Targeting: \nGeneral Intervention  Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \nThe overall design of the project is pro-poor. The TA provides indirect support to government efforts to achieve its \ngoals under the SCFP. In addition, finance sector development has been found to provide direct benefits to the poor. \nFor example, a recent International Monetary Fund working paper estimating the quantitative impact of finance sector \ndevelopment on poverty in 65 developing countries found that it directly reduces poverty by raising the investment \nand interest incomes of the poorest 20% of the population. Further, instability in the finance sector directly reduces \nincomes of the poor, thereby raising poverty.c Therefore, finance sector reforms that aim to mitigate risks of finance \nsector instability help reduce the vulnerability of the poor or the likelihood that the near poor will fall into poverty as a \nresult of finance sector crises. \nC.  Poverty and Social Analysis \n1. Key issues and potential beneficiaries. Poor or under execution of the budget compromises the government\u2019s \nability to deliver on its SCFP. Reduced expenditure on human capital (e.g., health, education, and social services) \ndisproportionately affects the poor through diminished productivity, as they do not have alternative income to \ncompensate. Inadequate spending on infrastructure diminishes competitiveness overall, but likewise has a disparate \nimpact on the poor as low-income regions lack the connectivity to participate in wealthier urban markets.\n \n2. Impact channels and expected systemic changes. The TA will provide for more cost-effective and permanent \nutilization of BTr\u2019s fiscal resources. By reducing the cost of issuance and reducing negative carry on the bond sinking \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \nfund, among others, the TA will free up significant scarce resources that can be redirected to support implementation \nof  the  government\u2019s  SCFP.  Increasing  expenditures  on  human  capital  and  infrastructure  will  ensure  equal \nopportunities, thereby achieving more equal economic growth and a corresponding reduction in poverty.   \n3.

Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n  Yes       No  The TA provides high level support to strengthen BTr and to deepen the capital market. While no \ngender elements are explicitly identified, improved budget execution will allow increased spending on budgeted \nsocial programs such as education and health, which are unlikely to widen gender inequality or to have a negative \nimpact on women.  \n \n4.
