During  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  operational  missions  in  2001,  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam reconfirmed an earlier request for assistance for the preparation of a \npower  transmission  system  project  to  enhance  overall  power  system  efficiency.  A  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  for  the  Northern  Power  Transmission  Project  is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2002-2004 Country Strategy and Program (CSP) and an ensuing loan project \nis included for 2004. An ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam from 23 September to \n11 October 2002 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, scope, \ncost,  financing,  and  implementation  arrangements  and  the  consultants\u2019  outline  terms  of \nreference for the PPTA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s record in reducing poverty in the 1990s was impressive, with a decline by \nover 20 percentage points between 1993 and 1998 that was accompanied by gains in other \nquality of life indicators. Economic growth in the same period averaged 8.8% annually. Thus, \nsustainable  economic  growth  is  one  of  the  key  ingredients  for  the  Government\u2019s  poverty \nreduction  goal.  Regional  level  analysis  within  Viet  Nam  confirms  the  relationship  between \ngrowth and poverty reduction. In richer regions, notably the Red River delta and the southeast, \nreduction  in  poverty  incidence  has  been  associated  with  high  farm  productivity  and  more \nopportunities to supplement farm income with nonfarm income. Thus, there is a positive linkage \nin these richer regions between farm and nonfarm output, which accelerates the rate of poverty \nreduction.2  \n \n3.  The power sector is an essential underlying input for economic growth and job creation. \nAs a result of high economic growth and the very low initial power consumption level, the \npercentage demand for power has been growing at an average of 13% annually for the last \n5 years, and the demand growth during the first 8 months of 2002 has been around 18% \nannualized. The rapid demand growth must be matched with investments in sector expansion to \nensure the security of the power supply for continued economic growth.  \n \n4.  Electricity  of  Vietnam  (EVN),  a  state-owned  corporation,  operates  the  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution systems in the country and is also responsible for long-term \npower sector planning. According to the Master Plan for Power Development for Viet Nam over \nthe period 2001\u20132010 (5th Master Plan)3 annual investments of about $1.5 billion are required to \nincrease electricity supplies sufficiently to support the Government\u2019s growth projection of 6\u20138% \nannually. The 5th Master Plan also contains a vision for power sector development up to 2020. \nGiven the long-term horizon of the 5th Master Plan, load demand projections and corresponding \ninvestment projects are further divided into 5-year plans. Projects identified for inclusion under \nthe PPTA are from the 5-year period 2006\u20132010 with a view to the timing of the proposed loan \nproject.  \n \n5.  The northern region of Viet Nam is one of the fastest economic growth areas in the \ncountry, especially the development triangle of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh provinces. \nPower demand growth in the triangle has reached such levels that EVN expects shortages in \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 1998. \n2   ADB. 2001.

", "2 \nthe northern region by 2005. The doubling of the 500 kilovolt (kV) north-south transmission line \nis thus of highest priority to secure sufficient wheeling of power from south to north; it will be \ncompleted by the end of 2005.4 Extension of the 500 kV network in the north-eastern part of the \ncountry is a priority investment for the 5-year plan (2006-2010). The 500 kV line will be required \nto secure evacuation of power from the planned generation expansion for the Hanoi-Haiphong-\nQuang Ninh development triangle that is projected to add 2,000 megawatts of capacity by 2010. \nExpansion of 220 kV substations in the development triangle is critical to support the expected \nload  growth  at  the  local  level,  to  ensure  system  reliability  and  stability,  and  to  reduce \ntransmission losses. Overloading of lines creates stability problems and may result in loss of \nline that can cause substantial power outages and impact negatively on economic growth.  \n \n6.  The National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC), in conjunction with the three regional load \ndispatch  centers  (RLDCs),  carries  out  system  control.  NLDC  controls  the  operation  of  all \nnational power plants, 500 kV substations, and 500 kV transmission lines. In addition, NLDC \nmaintains  control  over  system  frequency  and  voltage.  RLDCs  control  the  operation  of \ntransmission lines and substations from 220 kV to 66 kV, and small power plants. Although EVN \nhas the necessary technical systems installed in its substations, major power plants, and control \ncenters, they are used only for data acquisition. Supervisory control is not executed, as the \ncommunication  links  are  not  adequately  secure,  and  many  of  EVN\u2019s  substations  are  not \nequipped with remote terminal units. The substations and major power plants of EVN are \ntherefore still manned. To overcome this situation, EVN is considering the purchase of remote \nterminal units and communication equipment for many of the existing substations so that they \ncan be brought under the control and supervision of NLDC and the RLDCs. EVN also plans to \nprepare a Master Plan on Development of Load Dispatching Facilities with a view to expected \nsubregional (international) power trading by 2010 and continued system expansion.  \n  \n7.  Rapid  growth  of  the  power  sector  has  required  the  Government  to  consider  the \nintroduction of market-based reforms in the way it manages and operates the sector. In 1997, \nthe Government issued a Power Sector Policy Statement for a market-oriented power sector \nwith greater efficiency and transparency, and lower cost of electricity. Areas addressed in the \npolicy statement relate to (i) structural reform and commercialization of sector enterprises, \n(ii) legal and regulatory reform, (iii) electricity pricing, (iv) rural electrification, and (v) electricity \nconservation.  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  Government  in  its  reform  effort  through  the \nprovision of several TAs; however, the pace of reform implementation has been slow. In 2001, \nthe Government decided to introduce a limited power pool by 2005. Major reform decisions \ntaken by the Government include those to (i) introduce competition in the generation and \ndistribution  sector,  (ii)  maintain  the  transmission  sector  as  a  government  monopoly,  and \n(iii) introduce  cost-based  bulk  tariffs.  Implementation  of  cost-based  bulk  tariffs  and  further \ndevelopment of an efficient pricing mechanism and contractual relationships among EVN\u2019s \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution businesses to fully recover the cost of service by 2005 \nwill be crucial for improved performance of the sector and successful introduction of a limited \npower  pool.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  implementation  of  its  sector  reform  goals,  ADB \nrecently approved a TA for Roadmap for Power Sector Reform5 that will define a time-bound \naction plan for restructuring of the power sector. The consultants recruited under the TA will \nprovide the necessary support to the Government to meet is reform objectives. On this basis, \nADB\u2019s lending will continue to support efficient and viable investments in the power sector \n                                                 \n4   The World Bank approved an International Development Association loan for $225 million in June 2002 that \nincludes funding for construction of 300 kilometers of the 500 kV north-south transmission line from Pleiku to Da \nNang, one new 500 kV substation, and expansion of an existing 500 kV substation. The loan also provides \nfunding for construction and upgrading of 220 and 110 kV transmission lines and related substations. \n5   ADB. 2001.

The findings of the power sector roadmap TA \nwill identify the issues for dialogue between ADB and the Government and appropriate targets \nto be agreed upon in ADB loans and TAs.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of the PPTA is to support the Government\u2019s strategy for continued poverty \nreduction  through  sustained  economic  growth  by  assisting  in  the  preparation  of  a  power \ntransmission project to ensure a sufficient and stable power supply for the Hanoi-Haiphong-\nQuang Ninh development triangle, which has been identified as one of the key economic zones \nof Viet Nam. The project will also improve system stability and security, reduce losses, and \nimprove the reliability of supply through (i) the construction of 110 kilometers (km) of 500 kV \ndouble-circuit transmission line from Quang Ninh to Thuong Tin, (ii) construction of one 500 kV \nsubstation at Quang Ninh and one 220 kV substation at Van Tri, (iii) extension of one 500 kV \nand  six  220  kV  substations,  (iv) upgrading  of  the  existing  load  dispatch  centers,  and \n(v) preparation of a master plan on development of load dispatching facilities. The PPTA will \nalso support the CSP\u2019s focus on investment and support for private participation in power \nthrough public provision of transmission and distribution.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Key activities to be undertaken under the PPTA cover four major areas: (i) compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies;  (ii)  economic  and  financial  evaluations;  (iii)  linkage  among \neconomic growth, poverty, and the power sector; and (iv) technical project design. The four \nmajor areas will include the following scope. \n  \n10.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard polices for the environment and involuntary \nresettlement, detailed field surveys along the planned alignment of the transmission line, the \nsites of the two new substations, and the necessary access roads will be undertaken to identify \nany environmental impacts and to prepare a full inventory of all land and project-affected \nhouseholds. Necessary mitigation measures, most suitable implementation arrangements, and \ncosting of the mitigation measures will also be prepared. An initial environmental examination \nand a summary initial environmental examination will be prepared. A full resettlement plan will \nalso be prepared, since the temporary and permanent loss of productive means for affected \npersons could be significant. The resettlement plan will include design of public information, \ndisclosure and grievance procedures, and costing of compensation. The nature of the project\u2019s \nimpacts are not expected to cause any specific cultural or social impact on any socioeconomic \ngroup,  including  indigenous  people,  or  exclude  any  from  benefiting  from  the  proposed \ninvestment project. Therefore, no specific indigenous peoples plan is required. The summary \ninitial social and poverty analysis is provided as Appendix 1. \n \n11.  In addition to financial analysis of the project, the financial management capabilities and \nthe financial performance of the executing and implementing agencies will be assessed. EVN\u2019s \nintercompany transfer pricing and bulk tariff structure will be reviewed to determine whether the \ntrue cost of supply is being adequately recovered and/or being subsidized through a transparent \nmechanism. In addition to economic analysis of the project, economic subsidies involved in the \ncurrent tariff structure and the extent of cross-subsidization between major consumer groups \nand regions will be analyzed. Existing estimates for costs of unserved energy due to unreliability ", "4 \nof the system will be updated; and several scenarios for the load growth forecast, paying \nparticular importance to potential impacts of external shocks on the economy, will be developed.  \n \n12.  To  analyze  the  way  in  which  the  proposed  investment  project  is  linked  to  poverty \nreduction, a detailed poverty analysis will be undertaken making use of existing surveys and \nprovincial data combined with field consultations. The assessment will be carried out at three \nlevels: (i) direct, (ii) indirect, and (iii) macroeconomic effects. Particular attention will be paid to \nsector shifts in production activities and unskilled labor intensity of employment opportunities. \nIndicators for benefit monitoring will also be prepared. \n \n13.  For finalization of the technical project design, detailed review of load forecasts will be \nundertaken with a view to ensuring least-cost technical design and economic viability of the \nproposed investment project. Feasibility studies will be reviewed, and a procurement plan will be \nprepared. \n \n14.  The rationale for the proposed 500 kV transmission line and the new 500 kV substation \nis closely related to specific generation expansion projects. Thus, any delay in the construction \nof those plants, or a change in the location of the plants, would make the proposed investments \nin the transmission line and substation unjustifiable. This is a potential risk for project economic \nand financial viability. Since the 5th Master Plan sets out the power sector investment needs \nover a specified period of time and by area (north, central, and south), a sector project approach \nfor the ensuing loan would introduce sufficient flexibility in the event that those generation plants \nare  delayed.  Under  the  PPTA,  suitable  selection  criteria  for  specific  area  coverage  and \ncomponents will be developed and decided upon collectively among the Government, EVN, and \nADB. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $556,500 and the local currency cost is $318,500 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost \nand a portion of the local currency cost amounting to $143,500 equivalent. The PPTA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining  $175,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs  through  in-kind  contributions  of  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, and partly from Power Engineering Consulting Company \nNo.1 (PECC1), NLDC and the Institute of Energy. These will include office accommodation and \nfacilities, local communication, counterpart staff, data, and other information needed for the \nPPTA. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. The Government has been advised \nthat ADB\u2019s approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  EVN, as the Executing Agency for the PPTA, has nominated the Northern Viet Nam \nPower Projects Management Board (NPPMB) to be the Implementing Agency. NPPMB has \nadequate experience with implementing externally funded projects of similar nature. PECC1 and \nthe Institute of Energy are carrying out the feasibility studies for the transmission lines and \nsubstations. The Institute of Energy is also responsible for system planning and for preparation \nof load forecasts. The PPTA consultants will have to work closely with PECC1 and the Institute \nof  Energy,  and  will  have  full  access  to  all  documents  and  data  required  for  PPTA \nimplementation. EVN will make sufficient counterpart funds available to PECC1 and the Institute \nof Energy, including for transport and counterpart staff for field visits. EVN will also provide all ", "    5 \nnecessary assistance to the PPTA consultants in liaising with other Government ministries and \nagencies and with provincial authorities, and in obtaining necessary data and documentation \nfrom these ministries, agencies, and provincial authorities. EVN will liaise with the provinces \naffected by the proposed investment project to ensure nomination of counterpart staff before \nfielding of the PPTA consultants. As load dispatch requirements are distinct and different from \nthose  of  the  transmission  component,  the  Mission  considers  it  necessary  that  the  PPTA \nconsultants liaise directly with NLDC for the load dispatch component of the project.  \n \n17.  The PPTA will require about 17 person-months of international and 5.5 person-months \nof domestic consulting services. It will be implemented over a 9-month period commencing in \nMay 2003. Outline terms of reference for the consultant are provided in Appendix 3. At the initial \nstage of TA implementation, a workshop for provincial and district compensation councils will be \nheld to discuss the work to be undertaken by the consultants and ADB\u2019s requirements related to \nresettlement. Tripartite workshops (including the Implementing Agency) will be held after the \nsubmission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. The consultants will prepare status \nreports for their specific scope of works highlighting any issues that could become critical for the \ntimely completion of the PPTA. The consultants will arrange for other workshops and on-the-job \ntraining for EVN staff and for provincial and district compensation committees as necessary. \nThe  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  project  and  energy  economics  and \nmacroeconomic modeling, financial analysis and financial management, power system and \ntransmission system planning, environmental impact assessment, resettlement, and other social \nissues. A consulting firm or consortium of firms will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Recruitment of consultants will be under the quality and \ncost-based  selection  procedures,  and  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  requested. \nEquipment to be financed under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. \n   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam for preparing the Northern Power Transmission Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. The technical assistance, initially financed as a grant, will be subject to the \nreimbursement arrangements set forth in Technical Assistance Operations6 and Streamlining of \nTechnical Assistance Operations.7 If the technical assistance results in an ADB loan, ADB may \ncharge  against  the  loan,  and  recover  from  it,  the  portion  of  the  initial  grant  that  exceeds \n$250,000 equivalent. \n \n \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 1977.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty  \npoverty analysis?  partnership agreement? \n   \nSustainable economic growth is identified as  The  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement \na key factor for reducing poverty. The power sector is  identifies rural diversification and domestic private sector \nan  essential  underlying  input  for  job  creation  and  expansion  as  key  factors  for  creating  employment \nincome  source  diversification  and  for  economic  opportunities for the poor and for inclusive economic growth. \ngrowth.   Improvements  and  flexibility  in  the  power  sector  are  an \n  important input in supporting provincial development plans \nand essential to meet the power demand of new industries \nand expansion of existing industries. \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nDespite the fact that electrification and electricity consumption are not really to be considered as outcomes, \nthe power sector is regarded as fundamental for poverty reduction and economic growth as an input.  Electrification is \nregarded as so important for achieving other development goals that it constitutes a national goal. Consequently, Viet \nNam has achieved remarkable achievements in expanding electrification, with less than 40% of the households \nconnected in the mid-1990s to nearly 80% in 2001. Less than 14% of communes, mainly located in very remote \nareas, are without access to the grid. However, electricity consumption patterns are skewed in favor of urban \nconsumers, who represent about 20% of the population but account for over 86% of total consumption. Consumption \npatterns are also skewed in terms of nonpoor and poor consumers, as electricity consumption by the poor tends to be \ndetermined by affordability of appliances. Despite these patterns, the high connection ratios across most provinces \nsuggest that capital investments in the power sector to meet future demand of existing and new consumers can be \nregarded as inclusive of the poor, both directly as consumers and indirectly through the contribution to enabling off-\nfarm employment opportunities in the private sector and to economic growth.  \n \nPoor quality and unreliable supply of power tend to disproportionally burden the poor because they are less \nable to resort to alternative sources of power and because they are less diversified in income sources such that loss \nof one income source may have larger impacts for poor than for nonpoor households. On the other hand, reliable \nsupply of power tends to act as an important factor for attracting commercial and industrial activities, which in turn \nmay enable the poor to diversify income sources through the increased availability of employment opportunities. The \nability of provincial governments to fulfill economic development plans to support social development and off-farm job \ncreation depends on the availability of sufficient power to support expansion of commercial and industrial activities.      \n \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Poverty Classification:  \nBeneficiary nonspecific intervention \nThematic Classification: Economic growth \n \nThe poverty analysis will make use of existing surveys and provincial data combined with consultations in \nthe field, and will include an assessment on three levels: (i) direct, (ii) indirect, and (iii) macroeconomic effects. \nMechanisms through which poverty and vulnerability of the near poor are reduced will be identified and subjected to \nqualitative and quantitative assessment. The type and extent of effects, and the mechanisms through which they take \nplace, together with key assumptions and risks, will be summarized in matrix form to give an overview of the \ndistributional impacts across key socioeconomic groups. The approach may include input-output table analysis1 to \nattempt to assess the impacts on poverty under \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios. To the extent possible, the \nstudy will include gender as a specific socioeconomic group across poverty status.  \n \nDirect Effects on Poverty \n \nWhile the proposed Project will include specific target provinces, improved power supply is fungible, and \n                                                 \n1   A simplistic form of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models. ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nmuch of the benefit is not expected to directly impact the poor. However, to the extent possible, the analysis will \ninclude direct effects, by examining and combining consumer base data and poverty data for specific target provinces \nto  establish  a  poverty  profile  of  consumers,  as  primary  beneficiaries,  and  their  consumption  patterns.  This \nassessment will make use of provincial data and review the results from the ongoing rural electrification impact \nsurvey2 and the findings of the recently finalized Private Enterprise Survey.3  \n \nIndirect Effects on Poverty \n \nThe study will include a review of the impact of development aspects, interlinking the projected effects of \nincreased power supply with sector growth patterns and employment, on poverty in the target provinces. It will make \nuse of provincial data, including labor force surveys and living standard surveys, and development plans of target \nprovinces, and will assess the impacts of planned development on labor absorption of unskilled versus skilled labor \nand implications for income and income source diversification for households across socioeconomic groups. It will \nparticularly  pay  attention  to  sector  shifts  in  production  activities,  the  ability  of  the  poor  to  benefit  from  job \nopportunities, the unskilled labor intensity of job opportunities, and the sustainability of poverty reduction effects. If the \ndata allow, the study will discern for gender effects of employment opportunities. It will include an assessment of \nprovincial fiscal implications of development plans (including increased revenue from new establishments) and its \npotential for improved social expenditure allocations and indicators.  \n \nMacroeconomic Effects on Poverty \n \nThe macroeconomic effects will focus on the type of economic growth that the proposed project will support \nthrough the provincial and national development plans, and its effects on poverty reduction. It will include an analysis \nof the constraints that specific groups of the poor and vulnerable may face in benefiting from economic growth. The \nanalysis will be based on geographical growth patterns across sectors and other relevant key macroeconomic \nvariables over time combined with poverty and social indicators derived from the Viet Nam Living Standard Surveys \n(VLSS).4 While linkages between economic growth and poverty reduction are strong in Viet Nam, the sustainability \nand continuation of such impacts and the elasticities of poverty reduction with respect to economic growth may vary \ndepending on sector growth patterns. Thus, the expected macroeconomic impacts, will focus on the causality \nbetween power demand and economic growth, sector growth patterns, and the effects on poverty reduction.     \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis:  \n \nA stakeholder analysis will be an integral part of the economic (distributional assessment), poverty and \nresettlement assessments. The stakeholder analysis under the economic and poverty assessments will be mainly \ndescriptive to assess the distribution of expected costs and benefits. For transmission line routings, information and \nconsultations with people and local communities in affected areas will need to be undertaken. The project preparatory \ntechnical assistance will design a full participation strategy to be undertaken before and under the construction \nperiod. The strategy will include design of public information disclosure, compensation and resettlement issues, and \ngrievance procedures.  \n \nParticipation strategy required: Yes \u2013 for resettlement and compensation measures. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2   Financed  under  the  Rural  Energy  Program  supported  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Authority.
