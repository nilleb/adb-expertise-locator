Social protection is defined as the set of policies and programs to reduce poverty and \nvulnerability  by  promoting  efficient  labor  markets,  diminish  people's  exposure  to  risk,  and \nenhance their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption/loss of income. \nFor  the  South  Asian  subregion,  the  social  protection  strategy  identifies  child  protection \ninterventions and projects targeted to women and girls as the top priorities. In the context of the \nproposed project, social protection means interventions to support especially disadvantaged \ntarget groups who are not able to help themselves to give them access  to basic rights and \nservices.  ADB  is  assisting  the  Government  in  various  areas  related  to  social  protection, \nincluding the Urban Primary Health Care Project,1 the Primary Education Sector Project,2 the \nNonformal Education Project,3 and the Post-Literacy and Continuing Education Project.4  \n \n2.  The country strategy and program for Bangladesh foresees a loan project for 2005\u2014 \nSocial Protection for Disadvantaged Women and Children\u2014and project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare the project.5 A Fact-Finding Mission from 16 to 25 October 2002 \nreached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements of the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Despite the considerable progress it has made, Bangladesh is still one of the poorest \ncountries in the world. Estimates, based on poverty monitoring surveys, indicate that poverty \nincidence  is  about  45%  in  Bangladesh.  Among  the  poor,  two  groups  are  particularly \ndisadvantaged:  women  and  children.  According  to  the  United  Nations  World  Population \nProspects in 2000, 48% of the population of Bangladesh was below 19. This fact explains why \nchildren and youth are a priority in Bangladesh.  \n \n4.  Women.  In  Bangladesh  women  are  denied  equal  rights  and  opportunities  due  to \nsociocultural and other reasons. Their human rights in the family as well as in the community \nare often violated. The issue of violence against women has been a growing concern in recent \nyears. Due to natural calamities and economic reasons, men tend to migrate, leaving behind \ntheir families. Women have to bear the burden of poverty in a discriminatory situation. Women \nof poor families are particularly disadvantaged and cannot participate in or fully benefit from \ndevelopment efforts. A national action plan, based on the institutional review and assessment of \nsectoral  needs  supported  by  multiple  agencies,  included  recommendations  for  combating \nviolence against women and strengthening the Department of Women Affairs (DWA). \n \n5.  Children. The ADB social protection strategy has as one of its main focal points the \nprotection of children. Children are a second group apart from women that requires special \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997.

In Bangladesh, a large number of children are working, live in slums, are denied basic \neducation, have no access to health care, and are malnourished. These children are almost \nalways the children of the poorest people in urban areas. The Child Hope  - United Nations \nChildren's  Fund  (UNICEF)  estimated  that  3  out  of  10  urban  children  live  under  difficult \ncircumstances. Their rights are violated at every stage of their lives. They have no access to \nsocial protection to develop their identity and to be protected from abuse and exploitation, and \nthey lack a support structure to prevent exploitation and negligence. Most of these children are \ninvolved in unorganized or even hazardous labor and work up to 12 hours a day. The starting \nage is between 6 and 8 years.  \n \n6.  Social  Protection  in  Bangladesh.  The  Government  gives  high  priority  to  poverty \nreduction and has undertaken major efforts to improve social protection for the vulnerable \ngroups.  Examples  of  social  protection  activities  are  the  vulnerable  group  development \nprograms, orphanages with shelter, education and health support, homes for vagrants, old age \nhomes for the poor, centers for the disabled, old age pension program for the poor, and support \nfor destitute women. During disasters, vulnerable groups receive food under feeding programs. \nThe  Government,  in  collaboration  with  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  runs  shelter \nhomes for those who have been rescued before or after being trafficked. Socially vulnerable \nwomen  who  are  victims  of  family  violence  are  provided  with  shelter  and  skills.  Both  the \nGovernment and NGOs run day care centers for children of poor working mothers.  Though \nthese efforts are important, the need for support is much higher than the benefits and services \navailable  to  the  poor.  Sometimes  the  services  do  not  reach  the  areas  where  the  target \npopulation live. The National Children Policy (1994) and the National Plan of Action for Children \ncontain strategies to provide basic protection for disadvantaged children. However, the plan has \nnot been fully implemented yet. \n \n7.  Various projects that address the needs of poor women and children are implemented \nby NGOs. A project of the Department for International Development (DFID)/UNICEF maintains \n1,500  centers  in  urban  areas  throughout  the  country  and  provides  2  years  of  education, \nincluding  literacy  and  basic  mathematics.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme \nsupports a project (Appropriate Resources for Improving Street Children's Environment\u2013ARISE) \nin six divisional headquarters and maintains 20 drop-in centers, which provide basic education, \nskills training, and basic health care to children from the urban slums. The current activities \nhave several drawbacks: (i) only a small number of poor children have access to services; (ii) \nthere are hardly any nutrition interventions; and (iii) the skills training in the centers concentrates \nmostly on handicrafts. The probability that these skills will help the children to get a job later is \nlow. Moreover, the aid agencies noted that a change in the training is needed. Projects targeting \nwomen's issues address women and poverty, education and training of women, women and \nhealth, violence against women, women and the economy, institutional mechanism for women's \nadvancement, human rights of women. The aid group together with the Ministry of Women and \nChildren Affairs (MOWCA) plans to combine the efforts in a strategic vision for the ministry in \ncharge (MOWCA). There is a clear need for assessing the various activities and establishing a \nstrategic plan for coordinated activities of the Government and Government projects with aid \nagency funding in order to assist MOWCA in fulfilling its mandate. \n \n8.  Legal Situation.  Legislation that defines the rights of women and children exists. In \nrecent years, new laws have been enacted, for example, dowry prevention, prevention of \nwomen and child oppression, and prevention of acid throwing. However, for a large number of \npoor and illiterate women access to the judicial system is an incalculable hurdle. Although the \nGovernment has established support centers for counseling and legal assistance, and special \ncourts have been set up in 10 districts to follow up oppressive practices against women and girl ", "    3 \nchildren, these efforts remain insufficient. People are not aware of the existing legislation and its \nenforcement is nonexistent. There is a need to analyze the legislation to see how far it meets \nthe needs of disadvantaged women and children. \n \n9.  Institutional Development. MOWCA operates through its agencies, e.g., DWA and \nJatiya Mohila Shangstha (JMS) at the field level. DWA has been functioning as the nodal \nagency for coordinating women\u2019s development activities in the field and has undertaken various \nactivities  to  support  disadvantaged  women.  JMS  has  also  undertaken  some  development \nactivities for the emancipation of women. In 1995, review of women in development was \nconducted as a multisource effort.  It found various institutional weaknesses in MOWCA and \nDWA. Despite these deficiencies, DWA has been providing economic, social, and legal support \nto women at the community level through its offices at the subdistricts and districts. The \nDepartment of Children Affairs proposed by MOWCA is still to be established. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TA will help the government prepare a project giving social protection to vulnerable \ngroups.  The  TA  will  explore  alternative  project  interventions  and  will  involve  all  relevant \ngovernment partners at central and district levels, communities, target groups, and stakeholders \n(Appendix 1). \n \n11.  The project will be directly related to ADB's overarching goal of poverty reduction and \nwill aim to improve the situation of disadvantaged women and children. The purpose will be to \nimprove services for the target groups, improve access to rights (awareness, recognition, and \nenforcement  of  rights),  and  improve  the  capacity  of  the  institutions  in  charge,  especially \nMOWCA. The TA experts, in collaboration with the Executing Agency (EA) and concerned \nministerial units, NGOs, service delivery points and communities, will come up with exact \ndescriptions of the project's target group, taking into account issues of ethnic minorities. Existing \nstudies and initial discussions with the Government and stakeholders showed certain groups \nthat are most in need of protection: exploited women and children (trafficked, sexually exploited, \nlabor exploited); migrant women willing to work abroad; retrenched women; victims of violence \n(acid throwing, rape, family torture); homeless, dispossessed, and abandoned women; children \nliving on the streets away from their families or who have no families. \n \n12.  During  reconnaissance  and  fact  finding,  discussions  with  the  Government  and \nstakeholders identified possible project components. However, it was agreed that the TA will \nevaluate their appropriateness and will consider alternative interventions. These components \nwere discussed: \n \n(i)  Services. For example, drop-in centers for children (giving shelter, basic health \ncare, nutrition, skills training, basic education, safe drinking water); services for \nwomen in distress (legal support, training, basic health care, safe shelter, safe \ndrinking water, assistance in economic activities, prevention of trafficking, and \nreintegration  of  women  victims  of  trafficking);  and  raising  awareness  at  the \ncommunity level. \n \n(ii)  Legal issues. For example, assist in linking MOWCA with the legal support \nsystem (lawyers association, legal aid committees, etc.), examine the need for \nchanges in law enforcement and support them; support ongoing activities to ", "4 \nimprove  birth  registration  in  the  project  districts;  and  raising  awareness  of \nwomen's and children's rights. \n \n(iii)  Institutional strengthening. For example, enhance the capacity of MOWCA, \nDWA, JMS, and other concerned ministries related to the project to fulfill their \nresponsibilities; support the process of establishing the Department of Children \nAffairs; support the implementation of national plans for women and children; \nsupport MOWCA in developing a national plan to combat trafficking in women; \nassist  MOWCA  in  developing  a  time-bound  strategic  plan  to  implement  its \nmandate,  taking  into  account  externally  supported  activities;  and  assist  in \nupgrading the skills of local bodies.  \n \n13.  The TA will look into the need for investment in infrastructure and will study suitable \nfinancing mechanisms to ensure that services delivered are maintained after the project is \ncompleted. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will follow a participatory approach where the target groups, communities, \nrelevant  government  agencies,  stakeholders,  and  NGOS  active  in  the  same  area  will  be \nconsulted and involved in consultations and workshops. The TA will clearly identify and evaluate \nprevious activities and studies in social protection to benefit from their experience and findings. \n \n15.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  define  more  clearly  the  target  groups  through  a  socio-\neconomic vulnerability and risk analysis including quantitative data; (ii) identify ongoing projects \nand activities, especially those implemented by the Government and NGOs and those financed \nby other agencies; (iii) identify gaps and best practices in the sector; (iv) define the scope of the \nsustainable interventions to improve the situation of the target groups; (v) assess the need to \nstrengthen the capacity of local governments, communities, and NGOs to manage planned \ninitiatives;  (vi)  define  key  program  components  including  management  and  financing \nrequirements; (vii) identify possible investment components of the project; (viii) identify the \ngeographic  area  in  which  the  services  component  will  be  implemented;  (ix)  establish  the \nquantitative framework and estimate costs of the project; (x) identify suitable executing and \nimplementing agencies for the project; (xi) identify possible partners; and (xii) identify the need \nfor TA and human resources. The TA will start at the latest in mid-2003 and will last for 6 \nmonths. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent of which $325,000 will be \nforeign currency costs, and $300,000 equivalent will be local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$500,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign currency costs and $175,000 equivalent \nin local currency costs. The Government will contribute the remaining $125,000 equivalent in \nkind, including office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, transportation, surveys, \nand workshops. It is proposed that the TA be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The EA for the TA will be MOWCA. A steering committee comprising representatives \nfrom MOWCA; Economic Relations Division; Ministry of Social Welfare; Ministry of Labor and \nEmployment; Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary ", "    5 \nAffairs;  Ministry  of  Commerce;  Planning  Commission;  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs;  Local \nGovernment Division; Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division; and DWA will be \nestablished.  The  secretary  of  MOWCA  will  chair  the  steering  committee.  The  steering \ncommittee will be assisted by four technical working groups (TWG). The main task of the TWGs \n(Appendix 3) is to serve as a critical partner by reviewing the outputs, give advice on optimizing \nthe results, and support the project in specific areas. \n \n18.  The TA will be carried out over 6 months, beginning at the latest in mid-2003. Experts' \ninputs will amount to 35 person-months: 25 domestic, and 10 international. The international \nconsultants  (with  person-months  in  parenthesis)  will  include  an  institutional  development \nspecialist (3), a strategic planning specialist (3), and an integrated service delivery specialist \n(team leader, 4). The domestic consultants are: a management specialist (co-team leader, 5), a \nlegal specialist (3), a gender specialist (3), a social protection specialist with focus on women's \nissues (3), a child protection specialist (3), a women and child health and nutrition specialist (2), \na poverty assessment specialist (2), a community development specialist (2) and an economic \nand financial specialist (2). All consultants will be recruited through a firm using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The simplified \ntechnical proposal format will be used. The team will be chaired by the international integrated \nservice delivery specialist and co-chaired by the domestic management specialist. A project \ndirector  from  MOWCA  will  coordinate  the  TA  activities  from  the  Government  side.  The \nGovernment and ADB agreed on the consulting team. However, the detailed terms of reference \nwill be subject to further discussion. \n \n19.  The  consultants  will  submit  short  monthly  progress  reports  summarizing  project \nactivities, issues, and constraints for the duration of the TA. In addition, four major reports will \nbe submitted. An inception report that includes a work plan for the TA will be submitted no later \nthan 3 weeks after the consultants are fielded. A midterm report will be submitted 3 months after \nTA inception, and a draft final report will be  submitted 5 months after inception. Both the \nGovernment and ADB will comment on the draft final report. The final report will be submitted \nwithin 3 weeks after comments from the review are received.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh for preparing the Social Protection for \nDisadvantaged Women and Children Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

In the short term, social protection \nservices will facilitate immediate survival by meeting the basic needs of most vulnerable groups, e.g. \nhealth, nutrition, education, shelter, and legal protection. There will be indirect poverty reduction effects \nthrough counselling, legal assistance, skills training, and employment-generating services by enabling \nwomen and children to deal with adverse living conditions, social discrimination, and economic hardship; \nimpacts should be closely followed through monitoring and at postevaluation. \n \n  In the long run, investment in social protection of women and children will benefit the whole \nsociety:  \n(i)  Health, early childhood development, and nutrition services help young children to develop \ntheir physical and mental capabilities. \n(ii)  Education enables self-sustained participation in social and economic life. \n(iii)  Protection from social, labor, and sexual exploitation reduces violence and insecurity. \n(iv)  Institutional  and  human  capacity  building  enhances  law  enforcement,  effective  service \ndelivery, and good governance. \n(v)  Awareness building and training promote a change in attitude toward women and vulnerable \ngroups, and antidiscriminatory practice. \n \n \nB.
