INTRODUCTION \n1.  The government, through the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), submitted a request to \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) in August 2013 for technical assistance (TA) to strengthen \nits anti-money-laundering (AML) regime and for combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) in \nTajikistan. The TA has been developed jointly by the Office of the General Counsel and the \nCentral and West Asia Department. A fact-finding mission was fielded from 18 to 22 November \n2013, which agreed with the government on the final arrangements, cost estimates, and design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1).1 \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  objectives  to  implement \ninstitutional reforms for private sector development, and reduce overall investment and business \nrisks and costs.2 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s AML and CFT policy, which guides ADB support to \ndeveloping member countries in establishing and implementing effective legal and institutional \nAML and CFT systems.3 This TA falls under financial sector development, which is one of the \nfive core areas of operations under Strategy 2020.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite a significant increase since the end of the civil war in 1997, Tajikistan has the \nlowest gross national income per capita in Central Asia ($860 in 2012). Economic growth has \nbeen mainly driven by consumption, fueled by remittances. Investment is relatively low, at about \n20% of gross domestic product, which limits future economic growth and job creation. Financing \nis  expensive  and  short-term,  limiting  private  investors\u2019  capacity  to  expand  and  compete \ninternationally.  The  financial  system  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  attract  and  intermediate \nsavings  to  support  investment  and  job-creating  growth.  This  requires  improved  financial \naccountability, governance at some banks, and the elimination of directed lending.5 \n \n4.  Tajikistan is vulnerable to the incursion of illicit money from drug trafficking and other \ncrimes related to the multi-billion dollar opium economy in neighboring Afghanistan.6 It is also on \nthe \u201cgrey list\u201d issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).7 This means that parties \nwanting to do business in Tajikistan are required to pay special attention to risks related to \nmoney laundering and financing of terrorism, which increases transaction costs. Tajikistan has \nagreed with the FATF on an action plan for addressing the deficiencies. \n \n5.  As part of addressing those deficiencies, on 20 October 2009, the President of Tajikistan \nestablished the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) within the NBT. In March 2011, the government \nintroduced an AML and CFT law. In March 2013, Parliament amended the Criminal Code to \naddress  deficiencies  related  to  the  criminalization  and  confiscation  of  assets  from  money \nlaundering and financing of terrorism activities. In June 2013, the government established an \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 December 2013.   \n2  ADB. 2010.

Nevertheless,  the  FATF  indicates  that  certain  strategic  AML  and  CFT  deficiencies \nremain in Tajikistan with regard to (i) terrorist financing; (ii) the confiscation of funds related to \nmoney laundering, and identifying and freezing terrorist assets; and (iii) customer due diligence \npractices. The AML and CFT enforcement system is still relatively weak, including certain lack \nof  capacity  in  law  enforcement  agencies,  prosecutors,  and  the  judiciary  regarding  the \ninvestigation and prosecution of money laundering and financing of terrorism offenses. Few \ncriminal cases involving money laundering have been processed. \n \n7.  The FIU is implementing a new software database that will further facilitate reporting of \nsuspicious transaction reports. Currently, financial institutions have separate access to the lists \nof persons and groups on United Nations and national sanctions via the NBT website, but the \nlack of an integrated database may prevent financial institutions from conducting thorough due \ndiligence  of  potential  customers.  The  NBT  has  recently  issued  instructions  to  financial \ninstitutions for the establishment of AML and CFT internal control systems. Since the database\u2019s \noperations  and  instructions  are  nascent,  there  is  a  need  to  review  their  consistency  with \ninternational best practice.  \n \n8.  In February 2012, the FATF introduced a new set of international standards to combat \nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism.8 Tajikistan is expected to comply with these \nrecommendations.  The  first  recommendation  requires  countries  to  identify,  assess,  and \nunderstand the risks they face related to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. \nBased  on  that  assessment,  countries  should  apply  a  risk-based  approach  to  ensure  that \nmeasures  to  prevent  or  mitigate  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism  are \ncommensurate with the risks identified. Tajikistan has yet to begin conducting a national risk \nassessment with regard to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Tajikistan may also \nneed to adjust certain laws and regulations to comply with the 2012 FATF recommendations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be reduced risks and costs of investing in Tajikistan\u2019s financial \nsystem. The TA will also benefit ADB\u2019s recently approved projects in Tajikistan, which have \nfinancial intermediary loan components to be implemented by domestic financial institutions.9 \nThe TA outcome will be a strengthened AML and CFT regime in Tajikistan. This will help \nTajikistan achieve a positive assessment in the next FATF mutual evaluation report.  \n \n                                                \n8  FATF. 2012.

The TA will deliver the following outputs: (i) national money laundering and terrorist \nfinancing risk assessment conducted; (ii) measures identified and recommended to address \nlegal and regulatory gaps under the 2012 FATF recommendations; (iii) AML and CFT control \nsystem improved; and (iv) relevant staff from government agencies and financial institutions \ntrained in AML and CFT related issues. \n \n11.  The TA will support the inter-ministerial commission in conducting a national money \nlaundering and terrorist financing risk assessment. The assessment will use as reference the \nFATF  guide  on  national  risk  assessments,  and  will  ensure  the  participation  of  different \nstakeholders.10 The  TA  will  also  identify  and  recommend  measures  to  address  legal  and \nregulatory gaps to comply with the 2012 FATF recommendations. This step will require review \nof relevant laws, rules, regulations, and instructions. The TA consultants may also support the \ngovernment to draft necessary rules, regulations, and instructions.  \n \n12.  The TA will improve the AML and CFT control and reporting system, particularly by \nensuring that NBT instructions to financial institutions comply with international best practice. \nThe  TA  will  organize  around  four  workshops.  Law  enforcement  agencies  will  attend  two \nworkshops\u2014focusing on financing trends and typologies, investigation techniques, legal and \nevidentiary issues, and case preparation for investigation and prosecution\u2014to be applied in \ntheir operational work. The other two workshops are intended for financial institutions and other \nreporting agencies to enhance their AML and CFT internal control systems. Relevant NBT staff \nwill also participate in these workshops. \n \n13.  Implementation of TA outputs assumes that (i) the government will continue to sustain \nhigh-level commitment towards improving the AML and CFT regime, and (ii) staff from relevant \ninstitutions  have  incentives  to  participate  in  AML  and  CFT  training  and  awareness-raising \nactivities. There is a risk that certain groups who may benefit from money laundering activities \nwould create obstacles to the implementation of the improved AML and CFT regime. The TA will \ncooperate  with  relevant  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  improvements  to  the \nimplementation of the AML and CFT regime will be effectively implemented. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Cooperation  Fund  for  Regional  Trade  and  Financial  Security  Initiative11 and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  space  for  consultants,  organization  of  conferences  and  workshops \n(including  the  costs  of  venues  and  meals,  accommodation  and  transport  costs  of  the \nparticipants, translators, as well as printing of training materials), and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The NBT will be the executing agency. It will establish a TA implementation unit to be \nchaired  by  the  head  of  the  FIU,  with  staff  from  relevant  divisions  of  the  FIU  and  other \ndepartments within the NBT. The consultants to be recruited under the TA will work closely with \n                                                \n10 FATF. 2013.

Consultants will also engage regularly with the \ninter-ministerial commission on the output related to the national risk assessment, and with the \nMinistry of Justice on the output that will address possible legal and regulatory gaps under the \n2012 FATF recommendations.  \n \n16.  ADB will recruit individual consultants consisting of two international consultants (an \ninternational  anti-money-laundering  expert,  who  will  also  act  as  the  team  leader,  and  an \ninternational legal expert) for a total of 7.5 person-months and two national consultants (a \nnational anti-money-laundering expert and a national legal expert) for a total of 12.0 person-\nmonths. The consultants will perform the tasks on an intermittent basis. ADB will also recruit \nresource persons for the workshops to be conducted under the TA. The resource persons may \ninclude staff from international organizations involved in this area, such as the United Nations \nOffice  on  Drugs  and  Crime,  the  Eurasian  Group  on  Combating  Money  Laundering  and \nFinancing of Terrorism, or the FATF. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The TA will also cover the costs of \ninterpretation and translation, and other miscellaneous costs. Disbursement under the TA will be \nin accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). TA implementation will be from April 2014 until July 2015. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to the Government \nof Tajikistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for Regional Trade and \nFinancial Security Initiative for Strengthening the Anti-Money-Laundering Regime, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  and Reporting  Risks  \nMechanisms    \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nRisks and costs of  Banks\u2019 authorized capital  NBT  Sustained economic \ninvesting in Tajikistan\u2019s  increased by 300% by 2020  growth \nfinancial system reduced   \n \nOutcome      Risk \n       \nStrengthened AML and  Tajikistan receives a positive  FATF assessment  Certain groups who \nCFT regime  assessment in the next  report  may benefit from \nFATF mutual evaluation    money laundering \nreport regarding compliance    activities may create \nwith the 2012 FATF    obstacles to improving \nrecommendations.     the AML and CFT \n    regime \n   \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
