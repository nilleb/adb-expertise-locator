INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the National Statistics Office (NSO) to \nimprove Mongolia\u2019s capacity to measure Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators.1 The \nTA is included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for Mongolia.  The TA will \nenhance the use of multiple data resources so that Mongolia can better monitor its progress \ntowards implementing the SDGs and the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision (SDV) 2030.2 \nThrough the TA, ADB will prepare detailed road maps on required actions to produce SDG \nindicators and will work with the NSO to operationalize these road maps. It will strengthen the \ngovernment\u2019s capacity in statistics and will support the production of more SDG indicators.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Government of Mongolia is mainstreaming the SDGs into its development plans \nthrough  the  SDV  2030,  approved  in  February  2016.  The  SDV  2030  sets  out  sustainable \ndevelopment  objectives  under  economic  development,  social  development,  environmental \n \nsustainability, and governance.The SDV 2030 and the SDGs overlap significantly. Only SDG 14 \n(life below water) is not part of the SDV 2030, as Mongolia is a landlocked country. The SDV 2030 \ndirectly targets seven SDGs and the remaining nine are contextually consistent or part of the \nSDV\u2019s core principles. The National Development Agency, which is responsible for overseeing \nand reporting on the SDV 2030 to the Prime Minister and to Parliament, is undertaking an exercise \nto strengthen the link between the SDV 2030 and the SDGs. The goal is to link existing policies \nto the SDV 2030 and to establish baselines and set targets for its delivery. The SDV 2030 is due \nfor review on a biannual basis. The NSO is the agency responsible for compiling indicators and \nproviding guidance to on methodologies to line ministries, which are responsible for gathering the \n \ndata required to compile indicators. \n \n3.  The SDG indicator availability in Mongolia has significant gaps. Several assessments of \nindicator availability have been completed. The NSO led the first assessment in 2015, with the \nsupport  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).4 The  NSO  conducted \nsubsequent assessments in March 2016, October 2017, and April 2018. It regularly monitors and \nassesses the availability of indicators and makes this information available on the NSO website. \nThe latest assessment suggests that Mongolia has 126 unavailable SDG indicators. The NSO \nhas also identified four SDGs that require extra attention because they are important, lack \navailable indicators, and/or lack development partner support. These are the SDGs on poverty, \nhunger, education, and gender. Seven indicators are unavailable under SDG 1 (poverty), seven \nare unavailable under SDG 2 (hunger), five are unavailable under SDG 4 (education), and eight \nare unavailable under SDG 5 (gender). Furthermore, many of the indicators under all SDGs that \nare available do not meet the disaggregated requirements of the SDGs.5 \n \n4.  Several factors prevent the NSO from collecting more indicators: (i) for some of the SDG \nindicators, the NSO needs technical support to identify what steps need to be taken to finalize the \n                                                \n1  United Nations. 2016. Sustainable Development Goals. https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300    \n2  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030. Ulaanbaatar. Mongolia was among \nthe first developing countries in the world to link its development strategy to the SDGs. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 March 2018. \n4  NSO and UNDP. 2015. Joint Review of National Data Availability for SDGs.  Ulaanbaatar. \n5  The SDG indicators are proposed to be disaggregated for different subpopulation groups based on income class, \ngender, ethnicity, geographic location, and other relevant dimensions. \n ", "2  \n \nmethodology and identify the best data collection vehicle; (ii) the data for some indicators is \ncollected by other government institutions, and these institutions often do not have the expertise \nto collect the data as required to produce the indicator; and (iii) the NSO is unfamiliar with \nnontraditional data methods that could be used to enhance the availability of SDG indicators. The \nbest way to increase the number of available indicators is for the NSO to prepare detailed road \nmaps to identify what needs to be done to produce the missing indicators. ADB should then \nprovide targeted support to the NSO and other government institutions to make meaningful \nprogress on producing certain indicators. The TA should move ahead with two core principles in \nmind. First, the road maps should be published and made freely available. ADB will not be able \nto work with the NSO on each indicator, so other development partners should be able to access \nthe road maps and provide support. Second, ADB should employ flexibility when choosing focus \nindicators. ADB is working closely with other development partners on this project, but not all \npartners have determined the level of support that they will provide. Some flexibility in determining \nthe final list of focus indicators on the part of ADB will be important in helping the NSO produce \nas many indicators as possible. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: monitoring of Mongolia\u2019s implementation of \nthe SDV 2030 and the SDGs improved. The TA will have the following outcome: methodologies \nand capacity for measuring and collecting focus SDG indicators in Mongolia strengthened.1 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Methodologies for indicators that the National Statistics Office can collect \nindependently improved. This output will focus on indicators that require action by the NSO, (as \nopposed to line agencies). Typically, data already exists for these indicators, but the NSO\u2019s data \ncollection vehicles and methodologies for compiling the indicators need improvement. Under this \noutput, ADB will support the NSO to produce detailed road maps for each of the four focus SDGs \n(1, 2, 4, and 5). These road maps will assess the status of every indicator under these four SDGs, \ndetermine what actions need to be taken to produce each indicator, and identify which institutions \n(national or global) are responsible for taking these actions. The road maps will target both the \nproduction of the indicators and the disaggregation of the indicators by sex, poverty status, age, \nurban or rural classification, and other dimensions deemed relevant to the SDV 2030 and the \nSDGs. This output will produce road maps for specific indicators requested by the NSO under \nSDGs 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 16.2  Under this output, ADB will work with the NSO to make major \nmethodological progress on at least seven indicators. Major methodological progress might \ninclude agreeing on a methodology that meets global SDG methodological standards, identifying \nthe right collection vehicle for the required underlying data, or actually producing indicators should \nthis be feasible over the lifetime of the project. Finally, this output will include training for NSO \nstaff so that they can continue delivering on this output beyond the project lifecycle.  \n \n7.  Output 2: Methodologies for indicators that require inputs from multiple agencies \nand/or line ministries improved. In contrast to output 1, this output will focus on indicators where \naction is required by an institution other than the NSO. The project team held initial discussions \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The target indicators under these SDGs are still under discussion with the NSO. The initial selection will be based on \nthe NSO\u2019s own assessment of which indicators (total of 24) it can produce independently under these eight SDGs.  \n ", "3 \n \nwith the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Science \nand Sport, both of which have expressed interest in participating in the project. Under this output, \nADB will draw on the road maps produced under output 1 for the four focus SDGs (1, 2, 4, and \n5), and will identify at least two indicators that will require the NSO to work with another institution \nto operationalize the road maps and make major methodological progress on producing the \nnominated indicators. ADB will produce guidelines that explain the subsequent steps to be taken \nto produce the nominated indicators and will identify the entity responsible for taking those steps. \nADB will identify the training needs for both the NSO and the other institutions and will provide \nsuch training. \n \n8.  Output  3:  Using  nontraditional  data  methods,  the  accuracy  of  at  least  one \nSustainable Development Goal indicator enhanced. Under this output, ADB and the NSO will \nidentify one indicator that can be made more accurate through the application of nontraditional \ndata methods. ADB will then provide the NSO with training in nontraditional data methods. ADB \nand the NSO discussed two possible indicators but further work needs to be done to identify which \nindicators are feasible based on the status of the indicator and the availability of nontraditional \ndata.  ADB  will  support  the  NSO  to  produce and  operationalize  detailed  guidelines  to  use \nnontraditional data to support the production on the nominated indicator.3 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The government will provide in-kind counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, logistics and administrative support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB will implement the TA from 1 July 2018 to 31 December 2020. The NSO will be the \nexecuting agency. The ADB Mongolia Resident Mission will lead the TA and will take a one-ADB \napproach  by  working  closely  with  other  ADB departments,  including (i) the  Department  of \nCommunications (regarding the conduct of workshops and training programs and the publication \nof knowledge products); (ii) the Office of Information Systems and Technology (regarding the \nprocurement of equipment, software, and other information technology needs of the TA project); \n(iii) the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department; (iv) the Strategy, Policy, and \nReview Department, as the SDG focal point (regarding the promotion of synergy with SDG-related \ninitiatives of regional and international agencies and other ADB departments); and (v) the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department.4 The NSO will form a steering group \ncomprising senior officials from government departments and agencies to guide the TA. The NSO \nchairperson will lead the group. NSO will send the group\u2019s proposed composition to ADB for no-\nobjection approval. ADB will engage a TA coordinator to act as secretary of the steering group. \nIn addition, the NSO will form a working group of relevant NSO staff to work with the consultants. \nThe  TA  coordinator  will  be  responsible  for  managing  this  group.  The  consultants  will  be \nresponsible for organizing and delivering training related to all outputs to improve the capacity of \nthe NSO and other government staff to implement the project outputs beyond the lifetime of the \nproject. There will be at least three workshops (inception, midterm, and final) in addition to the \ntraining. \n                                                \n3  The TA team is also exploring synergies with an ongoing ADB TA project, Technical Assistance for Data for \nDevelopment. ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance for Data for Development. Manila. \n4  The project team will explore collaboration with the UNDP, the World Bank, and other development partners.  \n   ", "4 \n \n11.  TA support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, meals, transportation, lodging, logistics and administrative \nsupport, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with standard ADB \nprocedures, the TA will not support the executing agency\u2019s management fees or related costs \nsuch  as  staff  salaries  and  allowances;  other  executing  agency  resources,  such  as  office \naccommodation, will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. The TA project will \ninclude one study tour of no more than 5 working days for six government staff.5 The tour will \nfocus on best practices in SDG indicator collection. \n \n12.  The executing agency will provide office space, servers, and other equipment required to \nrun the activities. It will also provide access to utilities and telecommunications (including a \nbroadband internet connection) for the consultants. It will supply data and documents as required \nunder the TA. The executing agency will designate a TA focal point with strong English speaking \nand writing skills and will facilitate all TA activities and links to local government representatives \nand providers to ensure effective implementation of TA activities. \n \n13.  The executing agency will establish a separate advance payment facility in United States \ndollars at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The facility will be used to pay for the workshop and training costs, survey \ncosts, report publication costs, the study tour, and equipment costs. The executing agency has \nthe financial management capacity and internal control capacity to maintain records. \n \n14.
