INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will support the operationalization of the Export\u2013Import Bank of Pakistan (EXIMBP), which \nwill provide much needed trade financing facilities to help local exporters trade competitively. This \nwill help the economy increase and diversify its export base and promote long-term economic \ngrowth. \n \n2.  The TA will build on the outputs of ADB\u2019s TA for Prioritizing Interventions for Financial \nSector Development in Pakistan which produced a draft operational road map for EXIMBP.1 \n \n3.  The TA is not included in ADB\u2019s current country operations business plan.2 The Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) requested the TA3 to support the operationalization of EXIMBP.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  International trade has historically been a precursor to economic growth of developed \ncountries  and, more recently,  of many  emerging  economies. The  Government  of  Pakistan \nrecognizes that constraints on international trade inhibit economic expansion, competitiveness, \nand growth. Key barriers to export trade in Pakistan include limited trade facilitation mechanisms \nand inadequate trade-related infrastructure facilities and institutional financial support systems.5 \n \n5.  Trade-related financing is largely intermediated by local commercial banks, which limit \ntheir exposure by preferring larger and more established banking clients over prospective local \nexporters and suppliers that are often small and medium-sized enterprises. In many cases, \nfunding lines from banks, if available, are not competitive, have short tenors, and require high \nlevels  of  collateral  that  impose  significant  capital  and  liquidity  constraints  on  borrowers, \nparticularly local export-oriented manufacturers and producers that rely on imports of capital \ngoods and raw materials. Moreover, most exporters do not purchase credit insurance against \nnonpayment of their accounts receivables, because of the limited access to international credit \ninsurance. Such insurance is typically provided by a national export credit agency like EXIMBP, \nwhich is not yet in operation.  \n \n6.  Limited access to trade finance places many small and medium-sized enterprises and \nother exporters at a disadvantage to international competitors that can access financial support \nfrom their country\u2019s national export credit agency, including credit enhancements, lower-cost \nfinancing,  and  insurance  for  extended  payment  terms.  This  disparity  discourages  trade \ncompetition and deprives the economy of productivity growth.6 \n \n7.  To address some of these trade constraints, the government established EXIMBP to help \nexpand and diversify Pakistan\u2019s export base and mitigate the risks local businesses face in \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

The State Bank of Pakistan, \nPakistan\u2019s central bank, has assigned five staff to managerial positions at EXIMBP, including its \nchief executive officer,8 who is spearheading its operationalization process. EXIMBP has yet to \nsecure its certificate to start business. It is seeking ADB\u2019s assistance to operationalize the \ncompany through the TA and may ask ADB to capitalize the company in the future.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: export competitiveness and diversification \nimproved.9 The TA will have the following outcome: EXIMBP operationalized.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n9.  Output 1: EXIMBP operational and institutional structure reviewed. The TA will \nreview  EXIMBP\u2019s  operational  and  institutional  arrangements  and  benchmark  them  against \ninternational  best  practices.  EXIMBP  was  incorporated  in  June  2015  and  the  government \nprovided initial capital to kick start its formation, but it does not have sufficient resources (both \nhuman and capital) and the legal and institutional arrangements to assume full operation. \n \n10.  Output 2: Operational road map and business plan updated. The TA will revisit and \nenhance the preliminary road map (established in 2017 and financed under ADB\u2019s TA for \nPrioritizing Interventions for Financial Sector Development in Pakistan), incorporating key issues \nidentified in the review. The TA will also formulate a business plan that articulates EXIMBP\u2019s \nshort- and medium-term objectives and strategies. Based on a market assessment, the plan will \nfocus on supporting key sectors and industries that will benefit from the service offering and will \ncontribute significantly to the country\u2019s export diversity and economic growth. The TA will develop \nstandard documentation on various product offerings and corresponding operational policies and \nmanuals. \n \n11.  Output 3: Legal and regulatory framework and other institutional arrangements \nrequired for EXIMBP\u2019s operation determined and enacted. The TA will help the government \nestablish (i) a legal and regulatory framework in which EXIM Bank can operate successfully and \n(ii) relevant guidelines for the management and MOF approval of a national interest account that \nprovides credit support for EXIM Bank\u2019s liabilities. The government credit support, through MOF, \nwill be vital to EXIM Bank\u2019s credit worthiness and overall market acceptance. \n \n12.  Output 4: Economic, financial, and safeguards assessment performed. The TA will \nassess  EXIMBP\u2019s  economic  and financial  viability,  evaluate  its financial  management,  and \ndevelop an environmental and social management system. \n \n                                                \n7  EXIM Bank of Pakistan: eximbank.gov.pk. \n8  Rana Rashid Mehmood is a senior joint director at the State Bank of Pakistan. \n9  Government of Pakistan. 2017.

The TA is estimated to cost $625,000, of which $500,000 and will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, interdepartmental coordination, \nand other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  its  Central  and  West  Asia  Department,  Public \nManagement, Financial Sector and Trade Division, which will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants, organize discussions, and provide staff to act as the resource persons as required \nto  implement  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  will  provide,  as  needed,  local \nadministrative and coordination support. \n \n15.

Consulting services. ADB will engage a consulting firm through quality-based selection \nas the quality of the services is of overriding importance for the outcome of the TA and the \ndownstream impact on the export competitiveness of the country. It is therefore important that the \nconstitutive documents, strategy, systems, and policies are developed in line with international \nbest practices. Individual consultants will also be engaged to complement the consulting firm. \nADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.11  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Pakistan for Promoting Investments and Economic Growth through International \nTrade, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n11 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nExport competitiveness and diversification improved (Pakistan\u2019s Strategic Trade Policy Framework \n2018\u20132023).a  \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020:      \nEXIMBP       \noperationalized  a.
