INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to finance the policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for \nDevelopment of Geriatric Nursing Policy Principles and Training Program in Liaoning Province \nto (i) develop geriatric nursing training policy recommendations and a strategy, implementation \nframework,  standards,  curriculum,  and  modules  for  geriatric  nursing  training;  and  (ii)  train \nclinical nursing teachers and nurses in Liaoning Province. A fact-finding mission took place in \nJune 2016 and ADB reached an agreement with the Liaoning Provincial Government and the \nFirst Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University (FAH-CMU) on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, and terms of reference of consultants. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The main demographic challenges facing the PRC in this century are the dramatic aging \nof its population and the scale of internal rural\u2013urban migration. The proportion of older people \nacross the PRC is expected to grow from roughly 12% in 2010 to 34% in 2050.2 During this \nperiod, the number of people aged over 80 years will increase from approximately 20 million to \n100 million. In 2012, about 193.9 million people, or 14.3% of the population, were aged over    \n60 years (51.2% women), and 22.7 million were aged over 80 years (58.2% women). The \nproportion of elderly in rural areas is estimated to exceed 60% by 2050, compared with 30% in \nurban  areas.3 Moreover,  internal  rural\u2013urban  migration  and  other  factors  have  resulted  in \nroughly 100 million elderly people not residing with their children and 50 million rural elderly \nliving alone (\u201cempty nests\u201d).4 A further 10 million elderly have lost their only child, and this \nnumber continues to increase by about 76,000 annually. \n \n3.  About 81.7% of elderly people suffer from arterial hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, \ndiabetes, osteoporosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other chronic diseases, and about 20.9% have \nfour  or  more  concurrent  diseases.  In  2013,  an  estimated  5  million  elderly  suffered  from \ndementia,  with  a  projected  increase  of  300,000  annually. 5 A  significant  number  (about              \n23 million) lived in poverty or low-income conditions. The number of disabled elderly unable to \ntake care of themselves is expected to increase from today\u2019s 15 million to 25 million by 2020.6 \n \n4.  In 2013, Liaoning Province had a population of 42.6 million, and about 7.9 million (18.5% \nof the population) were aged over 60 years. In 2014, the number of elderly aged above 60 years \nreached 8.4 million, including 1.1 million (2.5% of the population) aged above 80 years. In 2015, \nthe estimated number of elderly people aged above 60 years, reached 8.8 million, including   \n3.5 million \u201cempty nests\u201d (footnote 4). About 56.9% of the elderly people suffer from chronic \ndiseases, and about 13.4% of them are disabled. Liaoning Province has 1,632 elderly care \ninstitutions  with  195,000  beds  representing  25  beds  per  thousand  elderly\u2014leading  to  an \nestimated shortage of beds of about 100,000. According to the 2012 study by the Liaoning \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 August 2016.  \n2  United Nations. 2011.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. 58 (7). pp. 1376\u20131381. \n ", "2   \nMedical University Nursing College, only 6.9% of nurses in the province had certified geriatric \nnursing qualifications compared with the national average of 10.0%. \n \n5.  The government has responded to general elderly care needs with new policies, legal \ninitiatives, and programs aiming to expand and improve social and medical services for the \nelderly,  including  geriatric  nursing  services.  The  Law  on  the  Protection  of  the  Rights  and \nInterests  of  the  Elderly  (2013)  calls  for  developing  social  services  for  the  elderly  through \nexpansion of professional training programs for elderly care service workers. The PRC Ministry \nof Civil Affairs Decree No. 49: The Pension Agency Management Approach, and the Basic \nNorms of the Elderly Social Welfare Agencies (MZ008-2001), stipulate that the elderly care \nnursing  staff  should  go  through  relevant  vocational  qualification  certification  by  nationally \nrecognized education institutions, and take examinations conducted by provincial and national \nauthorities.  The  PRC  State  Council  Opinion,  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission Policy No. 35 (2013), and the Liaoning Provincial Government Decree No. 4 (2014) \non Accelerating Development of the PRC National Pension Services, set the following goals:   \n(i) increase the number of beds for elderly care to 35\u201340 beds per thousand elderly; (ii) improve \nquality of training and expand employment of elderly care personnel; (iii) develop and support \nelderly care-related programs and courses on geriatrics, rehabilitation, nursing, nutrition, and \nsocial  work  in  higher  and  vocational  education  institutions;  (iv)  develop  and  implement \npreferential  policies  encouraging  higher  education  institutions  to  engage  their graduates  in \nelderly care services; and (v) carry out continuing education for elderly care services, including \ngeriatric  nursing  to  improve  the  professional quality  of  elderly  care  services.  To  meet the \ndemand for elderly care services, the government has initiated an expansion of elderly care \nfacilities and services at the home, community, and institutional levels, including geriatric care \nunits in hospitals. The government has also started investing in professional development and \ntraining of health care staff to improve access to and quality of elderly care services. \n \n6.  The trend of an accelerating elderly population has increased the socioeconomic burden \nand demand for elderly care services, including geriatric nursing in the country. Today, the \nelderly\u2019s special physiological and psychological conditions require high-quality professional \ncare, yet none of the medical vocational institutions in Liaoning Province have established \nelderly care training programs. There is an urgent need to develop and establish special training \nsystems  for  elderly  care  services,  including  geriatric  nursing  training  and  professional \ndevelopment programs. \n \n7.  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for the PRC.7 \nThe TA will support ADB\u2019s assistance to the PRC to improve elderly care services. The TA is in \nline with PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 and ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Health, \n2015\u20132020; and will complement other ADB-funded projects aimed at improving elderly care \nservices in the PRC.8 \n   \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016.

The outcome will be \nthe quality of geriatric nursing services is improved.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To improve the quality of geriatric nursing services, the project team will (i) carry out \nanalyses of international and national literature, including geriatric nursing policies, strategies, \ncurricula,  and  training  modules;  (ii)  analyze  best  practices  and  ongoing  international  and \nnational projects in geriatric nursing; (iii) undertake field observations in the PRC and abroad; \n(iv) conduct surveys, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions with elderly care nursing \nservice providers; and (v) discuss and disseminate the TA findings and outputs. \n \n10.  Key activities under the TA will be organized under four outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Policy recommendations, principles, and strategy for geriatric \nnursing training prepared. Activities under this output are: (a) review national \nand international literature, and policy documents on geriatric nursing training;  \n(b) review ongoing international and national practices and experience in geriatric \ncare; develop policy recommendations, principles, and a strategy for geriatric \nnursing  training;  (c)  carry  out  an  overseas  study  tour  on  the  development, \nplanning, financing, implementation, and monitoring of geriatric nursing training \nand services;9 and (d) prepare a gender-inclusive, peer-reviewed study report on \ninternational  and  national  best  experience  on  geriatric  nursing  training  and \nservices, including broad policy recommendations and principles. Gender-related \ndimensions of geriatric care will also be analyzed.  \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Guidelines, standards, and implementation framework for the \ngeriatric nursing training program developed. Activities under this output are: \n(a)  assess  best  international  guidelines  and  standards  for  geriatric  nursing \ntraining;  (b)  develop  gender-inclusive  training  standards,  guidelines,  and \nimplementation framework for the geriatric nursing training program in the China \nMedical University (CMU); (c) review and recommend good practices on geriatric \nnursing  training;  and  (d)  conduct  education  and  dissemination  workshops  to \ndiscuss and improve the developed guidelines, standards, and implementation \nframework. \n \n(iii)  Output  3:  Curriculum  and  training  modules  and  materials  for  geriatric \nnursing  training  program  designed.  Activities  under  this  output  are:               \n(a) establish groups of medical professionals, geriatric specialists, and elderly \ncare professionals; (b) develop and test gender-inclusive curriculum and training \nmodules and materials for the geriatric nursing training program; (c) develop \nquality  training  monitoring  indicators  and  system;  and  (d)  hold  a  national \n \nconference to present and discuss the developed training modules and materials.\n                                                \n9  The overseas study tour will be held in Japan, the country with one of the best geriatric and elderly care systems \nand services in the world, and will include substantive visits to one or more university nursing schools that teach \ngeriatric care with a strong integrated and outreach character, including engagement with community-based and \nprivate sector service providers.  \n ", "4   \n(iv)  Output  4:  Capacity  of  trainers  and  nurses  in  geriatric  care  delivery \nincreased. Through the TA, a final report will be prepared and six workshops \nand  a  national  conference  will  be  organized,  with  the  participation  of \nrepresentatives of the central and provincial government agencies; international \nand national health care universities, institutions, and providers; and private and \ncivil  society  stakeholders,  to  discuss  and  disseminate  the  TA  findings  and \noutputs. Training of trainers and nurses will be rolled out to prepare the nursing \nteachers and students of the CMU Nursing School and the five cities of Liaoning \nProvince:  Anshan,  Benxi,  Dalian,  Jinzhou,  and  Shenyang  (where  CMU  is \nlocated).  The  project  team  will  also  develop  a  gender-inclusive  knowledge \nproduct on geriatric nursing policy principles, strategy, standards, and training \nprograms for dissemination in the PRC. \n \n11.  Key risks to be considered under the TA include (i) potential lack of enrollment in \ngeriatric nursing and continuous training programs, (ii) inability of the trained trainers to carry out \ntheir training on a continuing basis, and (iii) failure of the Liaoning Provincial Government to \nmaintain its commitment to improve the elderly care system and adopt policy recommendations \nand standards. The project team will work closely with the project stakeholders to ensure that \nthe above risks are minimized and mitigated.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of teaching faculty (10 FAH-CMU professors) and \ndedicated  TA  implementation  staff,  office  accommodation,  geriatric  nursing  training-related \ndocuments,  statistics,  remuneration  of  the  FAH-CMU  professors  (20  person-months)  and \ncounterpart administrative staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  FAH-CMU will be the executing agency, and the Nursing Department of the FAH-CMU \nwill be the implementing agency for the TA. FAH-CMU will establish a working group for policy \nsupervision of the project. The working group will include representatives of the provincial \nfinance, health, education, and family planning departments, civil affairs bureau, and FAH-CMU, \nand provide policy guidance and discuss and approve the TA outputs. The administrative and \nfinancial work related to the TA management will be conducted by the staff of the FAH-CMU \ndean\u2019s  office.  The  overall  project  management  will  be  carried  out  by  the  project  director, \nappointed by FAH-CMU. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  36  months,  tentatively  from  October  2016  to \nSeptember 2019 and will require a total of 2.5 person-months of international consultant\u2019s input. \nThe consultant will guide and work with a team of 10 FAH-CMU professors with specialization in \n(i) geriatric nursing, (ii) cardiology, (iii) neurology, (iv) surgery, (v) internal medicine, (vi) nursing \neducation, (vii) intensive care, (viii) epidemiology, (ix) oncology, and (x) rehabilitation.
