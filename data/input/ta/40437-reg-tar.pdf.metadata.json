INTRODUCTION \n1.  A  midterm  review  of  the  10-year  (2002\u20132012)  Greater  Mekong  Subregion1  (GMS) \nstrategic  framework  (GMS-SF)  was  carried  out  from  November  2006  to  June  2007,  and \nendorsed by the GMS ministers at their meeting in Manila on 21 June 2007. The review\u2019s \nconclusions  included  the  finding  that  investments  in  physical  infrastructure  to  enable \nconnectivity  should  be  complemented  by  investments  that  enhance  competitiveness  and \naddress environmental and social issues.   \n2.  The proposed regional technical assistance (RETA) responds to the findings of the \nmidterm  review,  and  supports  cross-border  trade  and  investment,  enhancement  of  private \nsector participation and improvement of competitiveness. The RETA is aligned with the strategic \npriorities of the regional cooperation strategy and program for the GMS.2 It is included in the \nprogram of nonlending products and services for 2008 in the indicative Regional Cooperation \nOperations  Business  Plan  (2008\u20132010).  It  will  build  on  the  outputs  of  ongoing  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) RETA projects on implementation of the GMS cross-border transport \nagreement (CBTA)3 and the strategic framework for action on trade facilitation and investment \n(SFA-TFI).4 At their 18 January, 2008 meeting, GMS senior officials concurred with the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference  of  the  program  within  which  this  RETA  is  placed.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework of the proposed RETA is in Appendix 1.5 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  GMS  program  has  greatly  improved  physical  connectivity  in  the  subregion,  as \nevidenced by the near completion of the transport component of the three main GMS corridors.6 \nHowever, complementary policy and regulatory measures are needed to transform the transport \ncorridors into full-fledged economic corridors in which changes in productive structures will \nresult in greater employment and income earning opportunities, particularly for the poor living in \nand around the corridors. These changes will occur over time, and the arrangements to induce \nthem, including particularly capacity development, will need to be set in a long-term context. \n4.  Need to Improve Transport and Trade Facilitation. An important area where change \nis  required  is  transport  and  trade  facilitation,  including  (i)  regulatory  procedures,  such  as \ncustoms, sanitary, and phytosanitary (SPS)-related measures; (ii) transport procedures applied \nto goods entering and exiting a country; and (iii) the logistics services that are an integral part of \ntrade movements. Most efforts to improve trade have focused specifically on the procedures \napplied at a country\u2019s international gateways, including its land borders. Significant progress has \n                                                 \n1  Comprising Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. \n2  The GMS strategic framework identified five strategic thrusts, namely: (i) strengthen infrastructure linkages through \na multisectoral approach; (ii) facilitate cross-border trade and investment; (iii) enhance private sector participation \nand improve its competitiveness; (iv) develop human resources and skills; and (v) protect the environment and \npromote sustainable use of shared natural resources. \n3  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Implementation of the Greater Mekong Subregion Cross-Border Transport \nAgreement. Manila (TA 6307-REG, approved on 6 March, for $800,000). Supplementary grant from the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID) in October 2006 for $1,000,000. \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Support for Trade Facilitation and Capacity Building in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. Manila (TA 6328-REG, approved on 19 July, for $1.3 million). \n5  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 4 March 2008. This RETA aims to consolidate all \nmajor initiatives to address transport and trade facilitation matters in GMS. \n6  For  a  status  of  the  corridors,  see  the  midterm  review  of  the  10-Year  GMS  strategic  framework  at \nhttp://www.adb.org/GMS/strategic-framework.asp \n ", "2     \nbeen  made  by  the  GMS  countries  in  the  formulation,  negotiation,  conclusion,  and  pilot \nimplementation of the CBTA under the auspices of a series of ADB projects.7 Border crossing \ntimes at the Dansavanh\u2013Lao Bao border along the GMS east\u2013west economic corridor have \nbeen reduced significantly, for trucks from an average of 4 hours to 70\u201380 minutes, and for cars \nfrom 2 hours down to 30 minutes. Nonetheless, many border procedures remain cumbersome, \nand border crossing formalities and systems are inefficient, delaying the movement of cargo. \nThe objective is to reduce average border-crossing clearance times at CBTA checkpoints to 30 \nminutes for commercial and 5 minutes for noncommercial vehicles. \n5.  Trade Facilitation Issues. Varied progress has been made in GMS countries to ensure \ncustoms procedures are transparent and consistent, but harmonization and mutual recognition \nof  customs  documents  and  procedures  across  GMS  countries  remains  problematic.  GMS \ncountries lack confidence in each other's SPS measures. For some GMS country products, \nparticularly food products, the inspection rate is 100%. Most countries in the GMS lag countries \nin the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in the use of facilitative customs processes \nand  methods  of  work.  Key  impediments  exist  in  electronic  submission  and  processing  of \ndocuments, full adoption of modern risk management techniques, and compliance with the \nrevised Kyoto Convention. High-level dialogue and cooperation between and among customs \nadministrations  is  important  in  developing  policies  encouraging  intra-GMS  cooperation. \nCurrently, most third-party logistics services are simple and not integrated, with relatively few \nvalue-added services offered, and are unable to meet the increasing need for integration of \nsupply chains and secure trade. More attention needs to be given to logistics development in \norder to induce efficiency gains. Value chain studies on selected commodities and trade routes \nwill contribute substantially to the development of a logistics plan for the subregion.  \n6.  Need to Strengthen Border Level Support. To improve transport and trade facilitation \nin the GMS, it is necessary to address the major challenges faced by CBTA implementation. \nThese include (i) establishing efficient border management systems and associated capacity \nbuilding; (ii) streamlining and harmonizing border control documents; (iii) preparing revised \noperation manuals for the border checkpoints and related training; (iv) developing required \ninfrastructure and, in some cases, relocating and modifying the layout of border checkpoints as \nwell as providing common control areas to allow single-stop and single-window inspection; and \n(v) ensuring consistency between the CBTA\u2019s transport and trade facilitation measures and both \ninternational best practice and related agreements, such as those under the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  \n7.  Need  to  Initiate  Stronger  National-Level  Collaboration  on  Customs,  SPS, \nInformation  Sharing  and  Logistics.  Cooperation  between  regulatory  institutions,  such  as \ncustoms and SPS agencies, needs to be strengthened, and the institutions provided with the \ninformation  systems  needed  to  expedite  transactions.  Legislative  changes  or  substantial \nchanges in regulatory approaches to customs and SPS measures will require considerable time. \nFurthermore, international best practices suggest moving clearance procedures away from the \n                                                 \n7 In March 2006, ADB approved RETA 6307: Implementation of the Greater Mekong Subregion Cross-Border \nTransport Agreement to assist the GMS countries in formulating and negotiating the required CBTA annexes and \nprotocols and implementing CBTA on a pilot basis; it will be completed by August 2008.The CBTA aims to facilitate \nthe cross-border movement of goods and people along key GMS corridors by addressing all relevant aspects of \ncross-border transport facilitation in one document. All CBTA annexes and protocols have been signed and are in \nthe process of being ratified by the six GMS governments. Pilot implementation is being carried out along selected \nroutes and border crossing points. While encouraging progress has been achieved in CBTA pilot implementation, \nformulation of a well developed plan and capacity development is now imminent for effective implementation and \nmonitoring across GMS, now that most annexes and protocols have been ratified by the GMS countries. \n ", "                      3\nborder so that they can be performed more efficiently. In order to effectively introduce these \nchanges, a broader strategy that includes institution building and business re-engineering is \nrequired.8 Under the SFA-TFI, (i) analyses were carried out of (a) the current procedures and \ntechnology used by customs agencies, (b) the organization and activities of inspection and \nquarantine agencies, and (c) the structures and capabilities of the logistics industry; along with \n(ii) an evaluation of the methods for simplifying issuance of business visas. The analyses \nconfirmed  the  importance  of  increasing  and  coordinating  information  sharing  and  capacity \nbuilding  in  these  areas,  and  an  action  plan  was  formulated  that  (i)  enhances  intra-GMS \ncooperation  on  customs,  SPS  measures,  and  institutional  building  of  these  agencies;  (ii) \nestablishes an information platform that can improve information sharing for trade facilitation; \nand (iii) develops national freight logistics action plans to expand the variety and quality of \nlogistics services and address logistics network bottlenecks. This plan needs implementation \nsupport. \n8.  Need  to  Enhance  Overall  Coordination  and  the  Role  of  Private  Sector.  While \nprogress is being made under the CBTA in pilot implementation and SFA-TFI in developing the \npriority  programs  to  enhance  trade  facilitation,  some  critical  issues  need  to  be  addressed \nurgently. Transport and trade facilitation involves different agencies and ministries, and proper \ncoordination and planning require a strong commitment and high level participation from the \ninstitutions with competence in these areas. To facilitate this process, national and subregional \ninstitutional  mechanisms  for  transport  and  trade  facilitation  need  to  be  streamlined  and \nstrengthened, both to improve overall coordination, and to clarify the role and functions of these \nindividual agencies. Key requirements for effective CBTA implementation can be integrated with \npriorities under SFA-TFI, and efficiency gains realized through rationalization and consolidation \nof ongoing and planned activities. The business sector is expected to play an important role in \ntransport and trade facilitation and the development of trade logistics, and direct and increased \ninvolvement by the sector in CBTA and SFA-TFI implementation should be promoted.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the RETA is to improve the competitiveness of GMS countries. The \nenvisaged outcome of the RETA is more efficient movement of goods and people in the GMS, \nand between the GMS and the rest of the world.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The RETA will support overall institutional capacity building to strengthen transport and \ntrade  facilitation  in  the  GMS,  and  will  work  closely  with  relevant  regulatory  agencies  with \ncompetency in these matters, including customs and SPS agencies. Capacity building will be a \n                                                 \n8 The SFA-TFI was initiated in the second GMS leaders\u2019 summit in 2005 in Kunming, People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC). RETA 6328 provided the support to complement the CBTA and strengthen trade facilitation through SFA-\nTFI in GMS by: (i) simplifying, harmonizing, and increasing the transparency of customs procedures; (ii) improving \noversight and compliance with regards to standards and SPS regulations consistent with the requirements of the \nWorld Trade Organization; (iii) providing more efficient and integrated logistics services; and (iv) enhancing the \nmobility of business persons. A draft final report under RETA 6328 has been submitted, and a gap analysis and \naction plan completed. The trade facilitation working group provided guidance and technical inputs as it was \ninvolved in implementing this RETA. To successfully implement the components under the RETA on Enhancing \nTransport and Trade Facilitation in GMS, the overall capacity for coordination, and the role and functions of \nindividual agencies need to be brought out more clearly. The RETA will take key elements of the above action plan \nforward. \n ", "4     \ncentral  element  under  this  RETA,  as  the  spirit  of  GMS  cooperation  in  these  areas  is \nfundamental in promoting regional integration. The RETA will undertake a series of activities \ncentered on the following four areas:   \n11.  Component 1: Transport Facilitation. The component will (i) prepare a comprehensive \nplan for fully implementing the CBTA following ratification by all GMS countries of the CBTA\u2019s \nannexes  and  protocols;  (ii)  review  any  outstanding  legal  issues  that  prevent  full  CBTA \nimplementation; (iii) support high-level customs cooperation, including a strategic review of \nregional  customs  harmonization  and  introduction  of  risk  management  based  system  and \nintegrated border management; and (iv) formulate a comprehensive capacity development plan \nfor  full  implementation  of  the  CBTA.9  This  component  will  include  transport,  customs, \nimmigration, and quarantine procedures related to the CBTA. Coordination with other agencies \ndealing with cross-border issues, such as money laundering and human trafficking, will be \npursued. \n12.  Component 2: Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The component will examine \ninstitutional needs and develop a framework to promote GMS cooperation in risk assessment \nand compliance of food products produced within the GMS with relevant SPS measures, and in \nmeeting export requirements. It will address two crucial aspects of SPS: (i) risk management \nand (ii) laboratory mutual recognition and support. Some initial work will be undertaken to \nexamine the necessary legal framework to ensure hazard avoidance and compliance by small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is consistent with ongoing efforts under the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and ASEAN. The RETA will initially focus on agro-based commodities, and \nprovide training to enhance domestic capacities in collaboration with other agencies. \n13.  Component  3:  Business  and  Logistics  Support.  The  component  will  focus  on \nimproving the efficiency of supply chains through increased awareness and use of modern \nlogistics, and better cooperation between the public and private sectors. The RETA will assist \nthe GMS countries to formulate national freight logistics action plans by assisting with the \nplanning process, including undertake consultation meetings with GMS countries on the lead \nagencies and required participation by the public and private sectors in plan preparation. The \nnational logistics plan will focus on policy changes to improve sector performance, institutional \nstrengthening, and areas where investment may be required to alleviate significant bottlenecks \nin each country, and regionally. This work will help lay the groundwork for the implementation of \nnational freight logistics plans. The component will prepare thematic value chain studies in \nsupport of trade and investment. The RETA will coordinate with the GMS Business Forum \n(GMS-BF) on preparatory studies for proposed trade facilitation projects, and will help build the \ncapacity of the GMS-BF to promote private sector participation in public sector transport and \ntrade facilitation activities. \n14.  Component 4: Regional Information Sharing. The component will focus on improving \ninformation sharing among customs, SPS, and logistic service providers in the GMS for trade \nfacilitation. A feasibility study will be prepared for establishing the information platform. This \nplatform will be developed under a regional framework, with applications designed on a sector \nbasis.  The  RETA  will  assess  the  need  for  and  assist  with  development  of  the  regional \nframework. This initiative will be consistent with activities agreed to under APEC and ASEAN \nprotocols, and be closely coordinated with national-level efforts by other funding agencies. \n                                                 \n9  The Government of Australia has provided funding through RETA 6307 for pilot implementation of the CBTA at Lao \nBao\u2013Dansavanh and Mukdahan\u2013Savannakhet border crossings. ADB and the Government of Australia conducted \na joint mission in 2007 to identify how further joint cooperation could assist with the CBTA implementation, \nincluding the capacity-building program concepts that will be further elaborated under this RETA. \n ", "                      5\nShould  agreement  be  reached,  the  information  platform  is  envisaged  to  be  established \nindependent  from,  but  supported  by,  the  relevant  agencies.  The  RETA  will  review  the \ninformation available from the relevant agencies and prepare a prototype agreement to ensure \nthe  supply of  accurate  and  timely  data  and  to  control  access  to  this  information;  prepare \nperformance specifications for a scaleable information and communications technology (ICT) \nsystem; propose a management structure that will evolve with the range of information included \nin the platform; and recommend mechanisms for funding the platform. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $1.90 million\u2014comprising $1 million to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund for the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility; $500,000 to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund; \nand  $250,000  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  Australia,  to  be \nadministered  by  ADB  (to  be  used  to  finance  component  1).10  Further  cofinancing  by  the \nGovernment  of  Australia  is  under  consideration.11  The  GMS  governments  will  provide  the \nremaining $150,000 equivalent in kind, in the form of counterpart staff, logistical support, and \nother costs as they may arise.  The TA cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department will be the executing agency for the RETA, and will \nreport its outcomes to the GMS senior officials\u2019 meeting, the GMS ministerial meeting, and the \njoint  committee  for  the  CBTA.  ADB  will  closely  coordinate  with:  (i)  the  GMS  National \nCoordinators\u2019 Office; (ii) the CBTA national transport facilitation committees; (iii) the GMS trade \nfacilitation focal points; and (iv) the national and subregional mechanisms to be strengthened for \nGMS SPS cooperation, logistics development, and information sharing. A \u201cno objection\u201d will be \nobtained from participating GMS countries prior to starting any activities in the country. \n17.  The RETA will finance 46 international and 62 national person-months of consultant \nservices, for a total of about 108 person-months. Consultants will also be engaged to conduct \nshort-term  studies.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  as  individuals  and  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \nIndividual consultants will be engaged as the project requires a broad spectrum of expertise, \nand timing and readiness for fielding consultants varies in each case (Appendix 3 has the \noutline terms of reference for consultants). ICT equipment will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n18.  ADB will coordinate closely with international and bilateral agencies in implementing this \nRETA, including the Australian Agency for International Development, United Nations Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia Pacific, the World Bank, the Regional Capacity Building Office \nof the World Customs Organization, and others. ADB will also cooperate with other regional and \ninternational agencies, and national institutions involved in various aspects of transport and \n                                                 \n10 Financed through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) \nbetween the Government of Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank, and administered by \nADB. \n11 The additional finance would be used to support CBTA implementation plan (including the GMS customs transit \nsystem and the establishment of an issuing and/or guaranteeing organization, GMS road permit systems, ICT \nequipment, harmonization of customs declaration and policy advice and study on CBTA implementation issues), \nand the CBTA capacity-building and training plan prepared under the RETA. \n ", "6     \ntrade facilitation, and will engage their experts for training and capacity development activities \nunder the RETA. ADB\u2019s RETA implementation team will organize all the training workshops and \nseminars under the RETA. ADB staff will also serve as resource persons for these events. The \nRETA will be implemented over a period of about 36 months from April 2008 to March 2011. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.
