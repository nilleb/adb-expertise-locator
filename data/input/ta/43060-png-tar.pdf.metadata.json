INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving road user charges and private sector \nfinancing in road development. The fact-finding was undertaken from 21 to 30 April 2009 to discuss \nand formulate the policy and advisory TA. The fact-finding mission reached agreement with the \nGovernment  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimate,  financing,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA consultants. The TA1 is an outcome of the \nmidterm review of the Country Strategy and Program (CSP), 2006\u201320102 and is included in the \nnew  Country  Operations  Business  Plan,  2009\u20132011  for  PNG.3  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Development and sustainability of infrastructure is a key pillar of the Government's Medium-\nTerm Development Strategy (MTDS), 2005\u20132010.4 Roads are an important link connecting the \ncountry's  natural  resources  to  its  people,  markets  and  ports,  and  thus  play  a  critical  role  in \neconomic  development  and  in  reducing  poverty.  The  Government's  National  Transport \nDevelopment Plan (NTDP) 2006\u201320105 provides the strategic framework and plan for developing \nand sustaining the road infrastructure to meet the MTDS goals. ADB's CSP (2006\u20132010) for PNG \nhelps support the MTDS in four areas, including transport infrastructure. ADB has been providing \nassistance for road infrastructure improvements since 1972. A recent midterm review6 of the CSP \nproposes an even higher level of assistance for the rehabilitation and maintenance of transport \ninfrastructure.  \n \n3.  PNG's 8,700 kilometers (km) of national roads constitute the primary network linking the \nprovincial  capitals  and  main  population  and  economic  centers.  Provincial  and  district  roads \n(totaling about 10,000 km) provide the secondary and tertiary links. In addition to the Government's \nown  investments  in  the  road  network,  PNG\u2019s  development  partners  contribute  significantly  to \nimproving the road system. Ongoing ADB initiatives include the Road Maintenance and Upgrading \nProject,7 with $116 million in financing and covering 700 km of roads in the five provinces of the \nHighlands region. The project is scheduled for completion in 2010, although implementation has \nslowed due to significant delays in procurement of civil works. In December 2008, ADB approved a \nmultitranche  financing  facility  of  $400  million  for  the  Highlands  Region  Road  Improvement \nInvestment Program (HRRIIP)8 that involves improving 1,400 km of roads and maintaining the \nentire 2,500 km core roads network in the Highlands over a 10-year period. The Australian Agency \nfor International Development\u2014one of PNG\u2019s major development partners\u2014is implementing the \nlong-term Transport Sector Support Program, which provides annual financing of A$50 million over \n10\u201315 years for road improvement, policy and planning, and capacity development. The World \nBank's ongoing road maintenance and rehabilitation project provides financing of $77 million and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 April 2009. \n2  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "2 \ncovers eight provinces. The Government of Japan has provided financing of over $150 million for \nimprovement of national roads and bridges.     \n \n4.  Two major constrains impede improvement and sustainability of the road network. The first \nis lack of maintenance. About half of the roads in PNG and 70% of the roads in the Highlands \nregion  remain  in  poor  condition due  to  the  absence  of  regular  maintenance.  Without  routine \nmaintenance, improved roads quickly fall into disrepair, leading to poor road conditions, longer \njourney times, higher vehicle operating costs and isolation of rural communities. Consequently, \nsignificant national income from export of agricultural products and other businesses is lost and \nsocial conditions worsen, exacerbating the problems of social unrest and lack of security. Recent \nexpenditures by the Department of Works (DOW) on roads indicate that less than 5% is spent on \nroutine maintenance, with most maintenance funds used to respond to emergency maintenance \nneeds resulting from the frequent landslides in the Highlands region.  \n \n5.  Under  the  National  Road  Authority  Act  of  2003,  a  national  road  authority  (NRA)  was \nestablished to manage and maintain the national road network, using revenues from road user \ncharges.  A  road  fund  was  also  established  to  ensure  a  sustainable  stream  of  resources  for \nmaintenance. Technical assistance (TA)9 provided by ADB played a critical role in supporting the \nnewly-created  NRA  through  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  legislative  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment. A study on cost recovery carried out under the TA for preparing the Road Authority \nDevelopment Project recommended a levy on petrol and diesel fuel, and a road damage charge on \nheavy vehicles.10 In 2005, the Government approved these recommendations as well as use of the \nexisting tax credit scheme11 to finance maintenance. However, only a small levy on diesel was \napproved, which generates about K16 million annually. This funding is sufficient to maintain about \n650 km, or less than 15% of the national roads. Transfer of these resources to the road fund \ncommenced in January 2006.12  \n \n6.  The HRRIIP (para. 3) focuses on gradually improving the entire 2500 km Highlands core \nroad network through long-term performance-based maintenance contracts. Road maintenance \nfinancing needs under HRRIIP will increase from $4 million (or K12 million) per year to $25 million \n(K75 million) per year. Under the Framework Financing Agreement for the multitranche financing \nfacility for HRRIIP and the loan agreements for the first tranche, the Government is committed to \nincreasing the maintenance resources of the road fund through road user charges and meeting \nany shortfall from its budgetary resources.13\n \n7.  The Government is committed to expand maintenance financing through road user charges \nas provided for under the NRA Act. The Government intends to (i) increase the existing levy on \ndiesel, (ii) add a similar levy on petrol, (iii) commence collection of road damage charges on heavy \nvehicles, (iv) institute a mechanism to transfer resources from the tax credit scheme to the road \nfund, and (v) explore other potential means of enhancing cost recovery in order to finance road \nmaintenance.  \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Road Sector Cost Recovery Improvement. Manila (TA \n3191-PNG);  and  ADB.  2001.

NRA was given responsibility to reach an agreement with the \ncommercial operators.  \n12 To date, about K50 million has been deposited in the road fund. \n13 Performance Milestones for Tranches, para. 4, Schedule 3 of the Framework Financing Agreement; and Road \nMaintenance Funding, para. 4, Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement for Loans 2496/2497-PNG(SF): Highlands Region \nRoad Improvement Investment Program - Project 1 (footnote 5).   ", "      3 \n8.  The second impediment to the improvement and sustainability of the road network is the \nlack  of  skilled  national  and  international  contractors  to  undertake  road  improvement  and \nmaintenance works. Implementation of the ongoing Road Maintenance and Upgrading Project \n(footnote  7)  has  experienced  significant  delays  in  civil  works  procurement  due  to  lack  of \ncompetitive bids and frequent re-bidding. At present, there are less than five international and 15 \nnational contractors capable of working on road projects. ADB-sponsored private sector analysis14 \nhas identified the constraints faced by the private sector in doing business in PNG. Law and order \nis  perceived  as  the  primary  constraint;  other  constraints  relevant  to  infrastructure  contractors \ninclude the rules and taxes imposed by local governments, the high cost and low quality of utilities \nand communications, land compensation claims, the lack of skilled laborers and incentives, and \nthe high cost of labor.  \n \n9.  The  capacity  of  the  national  contractors  is  limited.  These  international  and  national \ncontractors have already been awarded several contracts each and are working close to, or \nbeyond, their capacity. As a result, progress on the awarded works is slow and contract completion \nis delayed. Furthermore, there is limited response to bid invitations for new works. The contractors \nwho submit bids for these works generally fail to meet the financial capacity criterion, necessitating \nseveral  rounds  of  re-bidding.  The  contractor  who  substantially  completes  the  works  in  hand \neventually qualifies and wins the bid. However, there is a significant loss of time and resources. \nLack  of  competition  has  also  led  to  increased  bid  prices,  resulting  in  cost  overruns  and \nimplementation delays, which affect the economic viability of projects.  \n \n10.  There is a need to encourage more national and international contractors to work on road \nimprovement and maintenance contracts in PNG that offer long-term opportunities. Experience has \nshown that large international contracts provide excellent opportunities for national contractors to \ninitially work as subcontractors and gain sufficient experience and skills to grow and eventually \nfunction as main contractors. The Government is keen to learn from the experiences of other \ncountries  in  the  region  in  successfully  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure \nprojects. The Government also recognizes the importance of addressing the barriers that prevent \ninternational contractors from bidding on infrastructure development works in PNG.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be sustainable financing for road maintenance that will facilitate \nimproved access to ports, markets and livelihood opportunities. This will improve road conditions, \nreduce travel time and transport costs, and will contribute to overall economic development. The \noutcome of the TA will be the establishment of a functioning system for collection of road user \ncharges to finance road maintenance needs. Another outcome will be increased competition and \nincreasing predictability in road infrastructure contracts.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will not only improve sustainable financing of road maintenance but will also help \nthe  Government  in  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector  to  participate  in \nimprovement and maintenance of road works in PNG. Regular maintenance will improve road \nconditions and will also save large amount of resources that are currently spent on reconstruction \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2008.

Increased interest from national and international contractors will promote \ncompetitive bids and timely completion of road contracts. \n \n13.  The TA will have two components: (i) increasing road user charges (RUCs) to enable \nfinancing of national road network maintenance, and (ii) reducing barriers to international and \nnational contractors and private sector to enable their participation in long-term opportunities for \nroad improvement and maintenance in PNG.    \n \n14.  The RUC component of the TA will involve: (i) assessing the maintenance needs, available \nfunding, and the resource gap; (ii) preparing proposals for the NRA for generating and collecting \nRUCs under the  NRA  Act; (iii) identifying additional road  user-related resources  that could  be \nmobilized for road maintenance; (iv) preparing policy and legislative reforms, as needed; and (v) \nassisting NRA secure endorsement by the Government.  \n \n15.  The  private  sector  participation  (PSP)  component  of  the  TA  includes:  (i)  review  of  the \nGovernment's  policies  governing  national  and  international  contractors  and  identification  of  the \nbarriers, (ii) preparing proposals for reforms, (iii) seminars and workshops to create awareness \namong  national  contractors  and  entrepreneurs  regarding  long-term  opportunities  for  road \nimprovement and maintenance in PNG, and (iv) international road shows to selected countries in \nthe region to learn from their experiences in successfully engaging private sector in infrastructure \ndevelopment and promoting opportunities in PNG. The national seminars will be held at selected \nlarge cities, including Port Moresby, Lae and Mount Hagen, and the invitees will include national \ncontractors, entrepreneurs from the local chambers of commerce and business councils. The \ninternational road shows will cover up to ten selected countries in Asia and the Pacific regions. In \naddition to meetings with the counterpart agencies in the countries visited, the international road \nshows  will  provide  opportunity  to  the  PNG  Government  to  (i)  inform  the  private  sector  and \ninternational contractors about the upcoming infrastructure development projects in PNG, and (ii) \nhelp improve perceptions of the work environment in PNG as it relates to the execution of civil work \ncontracts. These presentations by PNG Government representatives will be followed by individual \nmeetings with interested contractors and private sector representatives. In view of its mandate and \nexperience, Investment Promotion Authority will help coordinate and assist DOW and NRA in \nundertaking the international study. Prior to the road shows, the TA will assist the Government in \naddressing the issues faced by international contractors working in PNG and creating a more \nenabling environment for the private sector and for foreign direct investment.           \n \n16.  International  and  national  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  NRA  and  DOW  in \nimplementing the TA. The TA will also benefit from, and complement, ADB's ongoing TA for private \nsector development in PNG,15 which is focused on implementing PNG's public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP) policy, which was approved by the Government in December 2008. The implementation \nphase includes development of a PPP Act and establishment of a PPP Center to facilitate projects \nand identify potential projects. The TA will also benefit from the proposed second phase of the \nADB's Private Sector Development Initiative.16 The TA will contribute to the delivery of PPP \nprojects in PNG. The long-term, performance-based road maintenance contracts under HRRIIP \ninvolve risk sharing among the Government (NRA) and the contractors, and there is a unique \nopportunity to gradually develop these into more PPP\u2013oriented contracts.     \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2005.

The initiative \naddresses the binding constraints to PSD in the Pacific region through support for (i) state-owned enterprise reform \nand public-private partnerships, (ii) financial sector reforms, and (iii) reform of the legal and business environment. The \nsecond phase will continue focusing on these areas.    ", "      5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000. The Government has requested that \nADB finance $800,000 to cover the cost of international and national consultants\u2019 remuneration \nand per diems, international and local travel, equipment, and international road shows. The TA will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will contribute $200,000 to cover the cost of international and national road shows, \noffice accommodation, and remuneration to the counterpart staff. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  NRA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  NRA  will  also  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the RUC component. DOW will be responsible for implementing the PSP component. \nTA implementation will require close coordination with the Treasury Department, Department of \nTransport, Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Central Supply and Tenders Board, \nInvestment Promotion Authority and other relevant government agencies, local governments, and \ndevelopment partners. The TA is expected to commence in January 2010 and will be closed by \nDecember 2011. NRA and DOW will provide guidance to the consultants and will make available \nall relevant materials, studies, and reports.        \n \n19.  The TA will require about 28 person-months (18 international and 10 national) of consulting \nservices. Individual consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Four international consultants will be \nneeded with expertise in (i) road user charges, (ii) road funds, (iii) private sector development, and \n(iv) road asset management. The three national consultants will have expertise in (i) financial \nmanagement,  (ii)  national  legislation,  and  (iii)  taxation.  The  international  road  user  charges \nspecialist will function as the team leader for the RUC component and the international private \nsector development specialist will be the team leader for the PSP component. Outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The equipment procured under the TA will be \nprocured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will \nbe turned over to the executing agency after completion of the TA. The TA proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.17  \n \n20.  The team leaders for the RUC and PSP components will submit ten copies of the following \nreports to NRA, DOW and ADB: (i) inception report; (ii) interim progress reports; (iii) draft final \nreport; and (iv) final report, 2 weeks after receiving all comments from NRA/DOW and ADB. As \nneeded,  the  consultants  will  hold  stakeholder  consultation  workshops  to  disseminate  the  TA \nfindings and seek comments on the draft final reports.  \n \n21.  The Government will nominate up to ten senior-level officials (heads or deputy heads of the \nrelevant government agencies) to participate in the international road shows. These officials will \nmake presentations and respond to queries relating to their areas of responsibility. The DOW will \nprepare detailed proposals for the international road shows and will seek prior ADB approval.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment  of  Papua  New  Guinea  for  Improving  Road  User  Charges  and  Private  Sector \nParticipation in Road Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2008.
