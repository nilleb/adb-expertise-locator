THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will help prepare and/or implement a \nseries of ensuing and ongoing projects that support coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination \nrollout and expansion.1 The proposed TA will help ensure that the COVID-19 vaccines procured \nthrough the Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing and cofinancing administered by ADB are \ndeployed and administered in an efficient and effective manner, particularly among the poor and \nvulnerable population of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) in Southeast Asia.  \n \n2.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The proposed TA facility is aligned with the following \nthree operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities\u2014achieving better health for all, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iii) \nfostering regional cooperation and integration.2 It will help align COVID-19 vaccination rollouts \nwith universal health coverage strategies, as support for vaccination rollout also contributes to \nachieving universal health coverage. The TA facility will also foster private sector and civil society \norganization (CSO) engagement, given their important roles in vaccination initiatives.  \n \n3.  COVID-19  pandemic.  On  11  March  2020,  the  World  Health  Organization  declared \nCOVID-19 a pandemic. The pandemic caused devastating health impact, with more than 212.54 \nmillion confirmed cases and more than 4.44 million deaths globally as of 24 August 2021. Of \nthese, 68.15 million cases and over 1.01 million deaths were in Asia and the Pacific.3 Since July \n2021, there have been surges of COVID-19 across Southeast Asia. Daily cases exceeded 50,000 \nin Indonesia in the middle of July, while Malaysia and Thailand started having more than 10,000 \ncases during the same period. By the start of August 2021, increasing number of daily cases was \nhappening in the Philippines and Viet Nam (Appendix 1, Figure A1.1).   \n \n4.  Based on the daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people, Malaysia had days \nexceeding 700 cases per million in August 2021, approximating peaks of 800 or more cases per \nmillion which had taken place in the United Kingdom and the United States. Indonesia and \nThailand have reached more than 200 cases per million during some days the month of July 2021. \nThe ratios experienced by these three countries in Southeast Asia are among the highest reached \nin ADB DMCs, with only around 300 cases per million people in India and Nepal last May 2021 \napproximating these numbers (Appendix 1, Figure A1.2). These surges are being attributed in \npart to relaxation of mobility restrictions and community quarantines,4 and partly due to the spread \nof more transmissible variants.5  \n \n5.  The pandemic has resulted in devastating economic impacts. Global economic output \ncontracted by 3.3% in 2020,6 with economic output of developing countries in Asia and the Pacific \nshrinking by 0.2% in 2020.7 The mobility and travel restrictions, reduced personal consumption, \n \n1  The ongoing Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) projects do not include support for the activities to be \nfinanced under the proposed TA facility. Ensuing APVAX projects may also not finance such activities. A project \ninvestment component under the APVAX may potentially finance similar activities; however, such project is yet to be \nplanned and finalized. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Manila.  \n \n ", "2   \nlower manufacturing in key industries including the garment and car industries, and the collapse \nof tourism revenues caused the Southeast Asian economies to shrink substantially. The economy \ncontracted by 9.6% in the Philippines and 6.1% in Thailand in 2020 (footnote 7).  \n \n6.  Although Southeast Asian countries have expanded treatment capacities,8 the pandemic \nplaced enormous stress on the health systems. It increased the number of hospitalized COVID-\n19 cases requiring critical care and respiratory support exceeding hospital capacity during certain \nmonths of 2021 in Indonesia,9 Malaysia,10 and the Philippines.11 Southeast Asian countries have \nalso expanded their testing and isolation capacities, with increasing numbers of COVID-19 testing \nlaboratories and isolation facilities (footnote 8). However, the usual test positivity rate of Indonesia \nand the Philippines12 were mostly beyond the 5% threshold of the World Health Organization.13  \n \n7.  ADB response. ADB immediately mobilized financing and technical support to DMCs \nwhen the COVID-19 pandemic started. By April 2020, it had made available $20 billion to help \nDMCs implement countercyclical expenditure programs to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.14 \nADB provided DMCs with health sector emergency assistance grants and loans, and contingent \ndisaster financing.15 It supported the private sector response against COVID-19 with direct \nfinancing, working capital support, and trade and supply chain finance. It also provided around \n$56 million of  rapid  grants  under  the  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund  for  immediate \nhumanitarian and health emergency expenses to 29 DMCs, and an aggregate of around $100 \nmillion in TA across all DMCs. This includes support for implementation of non-pharmaceutical \ninterventions (NPIs), such as mobility and travel restrictions, physical distancing, expanded \ntesting to detect cases, contact tracing, and quarantine and isolation.   \n \n8.  Vaccination and APVAX. Despite these interventions, the transmission of COVID-19 can \nonly be slowed if the NPIs are complemented by rapid deployment of safe and effective COVID-\n19  vaccines.  NPIs  also  contribute  to  adverse  economic  impacts.  Although  the  complete \nelimination of COVID-19 is difficult given the highly infectious nature of the virus,16 vaccination \ncan help to control transmission in combination with NPIs. ADB therefore approved the $9 billion \nAsia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) on 14 December 2020 to support DMCs procure \nand deliver safe, equitable, and effective COVID-19 vaccines. APVAX-financed projects are \nexpected to help DMCs break the chain of virus transmission, save lives, and mitigate the negative \neconomic impacts of COVID-19 by restoring confidence in people\u2019s ability to work and travel.  \n \n9.  Vaccination rollout. In March 2021, the Philippines and Indonesia became the first two \nDMCs to receive support under APVAX. The $400 million Second Health System Enhancement \nto Address and Limit COVID-19 under the APVAX (HEAL 2) project is supporting the Philippines \n \n8   Center for Strategic and International Studies.

As  of  24  August  2021,  over  4.9  billion  doses  of  COVID-19  vaccines  have  been \nadministered globally, with Southeast Asia administering 227.57 million doses. Indonesia has \nadministered over 74 million doses, followed by over 23 million doses by the Philippines. In terms \nof the percentage of population fully vaccinated, Singapore leads with 76%, followed by Cambodia \nwith 47.7%, and Malaysia with 40% (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Status of COVID-19 Vaccination Rollout in Southeast Asia  \nAverage Daily  Total Number of  Population Given At  Population Fully \nNumber of Doses  Doses  Least One Dose  Vaccinated \nCountries   Administered  Administered  (%)   (%) \nSingapore  23,614  8,734,812  79.9  76.0 \nCambodia  210,651  17,313,877  58.9  47.7 \nMalaysia  497,105  31,792,363  56.0  40.0 \nBrunei Darussalam  5,862  246,716  39.3  14.3 \nLao PDR  9,730  2,050,711  29.5  13.8 \nPhilippines  368,897  30,389,160  17.4  12.2 \nIndonesia  792,069  89,153,125  21.5  11.8 \nTimor-Leste  6,834  491,569  27.0  11.1 \nThailand  599,876  26,832,179  28.1  8.2 \nMyanmar  3,666  3,500,000  3.5  2.9 \nViet Nam  375,983  17,065,896  15.8  1.9 \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: Bloomberg.

Studies show that the vaccination rollout in Southeast Asia has been relatively slow and \nstaggered amid secondary waves of the virus, and that women and girls are impacted by gaps \nboth in the supply and demand side, hampering equitable distribution of the vaccines.18 Southeast \nAsia still needs to vaccinate millions more in the coming months. This entails responding to \nseveral challenges\u2014from adapting to existing vaccine distribution approaches and establishing \nnew ones to implementing national vaccine information systems. Vaccine hesitancy needs to be \naddressed, while building up vaccine demand and ensuring compliance with two-dose regimen. \nAs of May 2021, more than 60% of the populations of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, \nSingapore,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam  have  expressed  their  willingness  to  take  COVID-19 \nvaccines,19 but there is a need to increase willingness to be vaccinated.   \n \n12.  Constraints on vaccination deployment. Southeast Asia DMCs need to strengthen \ninefficient vaccine supply chain, cold chain, transport, and storage systems. Countries like the \nPhilippines have brought in the private sector to support vaccine storage and distribution, building \non their experience of bringing in the private sector to expand testing for COVID-19 vaccines.20 \n \n17  ADB.

Also, despite ongoing efforts, there is still a lack \nof sex-disaggregated data on testing, cases, vaccines, and mortality in the region. Of the 11 \ncountries in the Asia and Pacific region that are included in the COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated \nData Tracker\u2014the world\u2019s largest database of sex-disaggregated data on COVID-1921\u2014there is \nno Southeast Asian country that consistently reports on COVID-19 vaccinations. \n \n13.  Indonesia is building upon its existing SMILE22 vaccine information system, and the \nPhilippines started a new Vaccine Information Management System. Both countries have been \nable to provide timely updates on vaccine deployment, but these information systems need to be \nstrengthened as daily vaccinations are increased to a million in Indonesia, and half a million in \nthe Philippines. Similar challenges are faced by other Southeast Asia DMCs as they scale up \ndaily vaccinations of their population. Additional challenges are expected as DMCs expand \nvaccinations to those younger than 18 years of age.  \n \n14.  COVID-19 vaccination rollouts require increasing the number of health workers and \nvaccinators, and vaccination sites. Countries have used shopping malls, convention centers, \nsports stadiums, and other large buildings to complement hospitals and health centers as \nvaccination centers. The Philippines23 and Thailand,24 for instance, are using malls as large-scale \nvaccination sites. However, all these vaccination centers, and future vaccination sites such as \nschools, need adequate staff, and recruiting a sufficient number of vaccinators is a challenge.  \n \n15.  Southeast  Asia  DMCs  must  implement  rigorous  monitoring  of  adverse  events  after \nvaccination. They should also be able to respond to an evolving pandemic and vaccine landscape \nby initiating or continuing contingency planning to address the (i) rapid emergence of new and \npossibly more transmissible COVID-19 variants, (ii) insufficient evidence of the duration of \nimmunity conferred by currently available vaccines, and (iii) availability and efficacy of second-\ngeneration vaccines. Given that herd immunity will not be possible if children under 18 years of \nage remain unvaccinated, Southeast Asia DMCs need to begin planning the vaccination of this \nage group, once all the necessary regulatory approvals have been obtained. They also need to \nmake decisions on the potential introduction of booster shots. All these existing or potential \nbarriers, bottlenecks, and challenges to vaccination rollout will need to be addressed as DMCs \ndesign and/or implement ongoing and future APVAX projects. \n \n16.  Need for technical assistance. The Asian Development Outlook 2021 Supplement \nreiterates the critical role of rapid vaccine deployment in economic recovery with its updated \nprojections of economic growth of 7.2% from an initial projection of 7.3% in developing countries \nof Asia and Pacific in 2021.25 The COVID-19 outbreaks and surges need to be curbed by, among \nothers, the rapid deployment and administration of COVID-19 vaccines as NPIs and related \nrestrictions have contributed to economic contraction. Because of the reimposition of these \nrestrictions in some countries in Southeast Asia, the forecast for Southeast Asian growth was \ndowngraded to 4.0% from 4.4% in 2021 (footnote 25). In addition to helping DMCs mobilize \n \n21 The database is produced by Global Health 50/50, the African Population and Health Research Center, and the \nInternational Center for Research on Women. \n22 Sistem Monitoring Imunisasi Logistik secara Elektronik (SMILE) is an innovative technological solution that aims to \nstrengthen the immunization supply chain system in Indonesia. \n23 Ayalaland. 2021.

TA \nprojects to be provided under the proposed TA facility will support implementation of the APVAX \nprojects and the overall COVID-19 vaccination rollouts in Southeast Asia DMCs.  \n \n17.  ADB technical assistance. The proposed TA facility will help Southeast Asia DMCs \nimplement CRISP, RECOVER, and HEAL 2 and develop other APVAX projects (para. 9). It will: \n(i) help improve logistics management and delivery of vaccines, and the implementation and \nmonitoring of vaccination prioritization plans; (ii) strengthen national regulatory authorities and \nimplementation of medical waste management programs; (iii) support contingency planning to \naddress variants of COVID-19, introduction of boosters and second-generation vaccines, and \ninclusion of children less than 18 years of age in national vaccination programs; (iv) support \ninvestments  in  vaccine  information  systems  and  strengthen  disease  surveillance  systems, \nlaboratory testing capacities, skills, and expertise of health workers, 97% of whom are women; (v) \nsupport the ongoing efforts of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to strengthen \nregional health security including supporting the planned ASEAN Regional Center on Public \nHealth Emergencies and Emerging Diseases;26 (vi) facilitate sharing of best practices among \ncountries such as setting up of a Southeast Asia-wide vaccine and health security dashboard; (vii) \nsupport partnerships with the private sector and CSOs, given their critical role in most if not all \nstages of vaccination efforts, from production, logistics, storage, to last-mile delivery; and (viii) \nmobilize resources to ensure that national vaccination strategies and policies are inclusive and \ngender-responsive, and that sex-disaggregated data is collected, monitored, and analyzed for \nSoutheast Asia DMCs.  \n \n18.  Rationale for a regional transaction TA facility. The regional TA facility approach is \nsuitable as it will mobilize consultant resources to address common issues faced in rolling out \nCOVID-19  vaccination and  strengthen  preparedness for future  potential  outbreaks,  thereby \nenhancing project design and efficiency of health projects and support policy-related activities \nacross Southeast Asia DMCs. The TA facility will bridge capability gaps which may emerge as \nDMCs deploy vaccination, by rapidly bringing in international expertise not available in-country \nand promptly mobilizing national expertise. The TA facility will also foster knowledge sharing and \ntransfer across countries and support the implementation of Greater Mekong Subregion Health \nCooperation Strategy 2019\u20132023. It will also reduce transaction costs compared to resources \nrequired for separate stand-alone transaction TAs. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n19.  Output  1:  Design  and  development  of  new  APVAX  projects  (rapid  response \ncomponent  and  project  investment  component)  and  post-COVID-19  health  security \nprojects and programs strengthened. This output will support the preparation of new APVAX \nprojects including the second APVAX project for Indonesia, potential APVAX projects in other \nDMCs in Southeast Asia, and possible additional financing of the current or future APVAX projects. \nIt will also support the preparation of post-COVID-19 pandemic health security projects. The \nactivities will include (i) assessing health systems, including health and vaccine information \nsystems, logistics and cold chain, health and vaccine financing systems, surveillance including \nlaboratory systems, and other service delivery capacities; (ii) assessing vaccine demand; (iii) \nassessing  vaccine  manufacturing  capacity;  (iv)  determining  implementation  barriers  and \nbottlenecks including those that deter access of women to COVID-19 vaccination and addressing \nthem in project designs; (v) preparing contingency plans including plans for climate adaptation \n \n26 ASEAN. 2020.

Output 1 will require about $1,450,000.  \n \n20.  Output 2: Implementation of APVAX and post-COVID-19 health security projects \nand programs in Southeast Asia developing member countries supported. This output will \nsupport implementation of the Cambodia CRISP, Indonesia RECOVER, Philippines HEAL 2, and \nother APVAX and post-COVID-19 health security projects in Southeast Asia DMCs. For CRISP, \nthe activities will include supporting (i) project procurement, (ii) financial management of the \nvaccine deployment, (iii) monitoring and evaluation of the vaccination plan, and (iv) participation \nof the private sector and CSOs. For RECOVER, the activities will (i) support the monitoring of the \nvaccination rollout, and (ii) strengthen the vaccine-related health information systems and vaccine \nlogistic systems. For HEAL 2, the activities will include supporting (i) vaccine communication  \nsystems including the development of communication tools that will maximize the vaccination of \nindigenous peoples, people living in remote areas and communities, and other vulnerable sectors; \n(ii) subnational vaccine deployment; (iii) vaccine certificate system; (iv) increasing private sector \nand CSO participation; (v) integrating gender and social inclusion, including implementation of \nany  gender  action  plans;  and  (vi)  implementing    medical  waste  management  plans,  and \nvaccination-related climate adaptation and mitigation measures.  Activities under future projects \nwill be included once determined. Output 2 will require about $2,300,000.  \n \n21.  Output 3: Knowledge and best practices on COVID-19 vaccination deployment \ndocumented,  developed,  disseminated,  and  promoted.  This  output  will  support  the \ndocumentation,  dissemination,  promotion  and  adoption  of  innovative  approaches  and  best \npractices for COVID-19 vaccination among Southeast Asia DMCs being supported by APVAX \nand post-COVID-19 regional health security projects. It will also develop innovative approaches \nresponding to the needs of DMCs. This will include: (i) vaccine deployment administration models, \nparticularly  those  that  ensure  deployment  to  women  and  vulnerable  populations;  (ii) \nunderstanding gender-related issues in designing incentives and other measures addressing \nvaccine hesitancy; (iii) involvement of the private sector and CSOs in vaccination access and \ndeployment; (iv) scaling up of country-level and/or region-wide COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing; \n(v) gender-sensitive vaccination communications (demand generation and responding to vaccine \nhesitancy); (vi) cold chain and logistics including region-wide logistics; (vii) vaccine information \nsystems;  (viii)  relationship  of  national  and  local  governments  in  vaccine  deployment;  (ix) \nmonitoring  adverse  events;  (x)  gender-inclusive  post-COVID-19  recovery  plans;  and  (xi) \nharnessing the possible contributions of COVID-19 vaccination to increasing climate readiness of \nthe health sector.  \n \n22.  In coordination with ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, \nthe TA will support impact evaluation of APVAX projects in Southeast Asia to further identify best \npractices. It will also support the development of country-level, region-wide, sex-disaggregated \ndashboards of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and other key health security indicators which will \nhelp tracking of these vaccines when they become routine vaccination. Customization of existing \ndashboards will also be considered. The promotion of best practices and development of the \ndashboards will be implemented in coordination with ASEAN and ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation \nand Operations Coordination Division. Output 3 will tentatively require about $1,250,000.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n23.
