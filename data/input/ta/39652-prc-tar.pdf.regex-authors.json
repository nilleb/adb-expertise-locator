During the 2005 country program  midterm review, the Government  of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance for the Gansu \nHeihe Hydropower Development Project (the Project). The Project includes the construction of \ntwo medium-sized, run-of-river hydropower plants (HPP) on Heihe River in Gansu province: a \n50.5-megawatt  (MW)  plant  in  Erlongshan,  and  a  60  MW  plant  in  Dagushan.  A  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA)1 is included in the 2006 country program. The concept \npaper for the Project and the TA was approved in February 2006. The Fact-Finding Mission   \n(the Mission) visited the PRC from 11 to 17 March 2006. The Mission discussed and agreed \nwith  the  Government  on  the  impacts,  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangement,  cost \nestimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. Given the          \n(i) scope, (ii) discrete and sequential financing needs,2 and (iii) staggered disbursement, the \nGovernment and the Mission agreed to use the requested Multitranche Financing Facility (MFF) \napproach  to  finance  the  Project  and  a  phased  TA  implementation.  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC has achieved and sustained an impressive economic growth, averaging about \n9% a year for the past two decades. Compared with its 2000 level, the economy is expected to \ndouble by 2010 and quadruple by 2020. Given the projected growth trajectory and the relatively \nlow3 per capita energy consumption of about 0.66 tons of oil equivalent per year, the demand for \nenergy is expected to continue to increase rapidly. Electricity demand is growing in step with the \neconomy. After the United States, the PRC has the second largest power industry in the world. \nInstalled generation capacity and power generation increased at an annual average of more \nthan  8%  over  the  past  two  decades.  By  the  end  of  2005,  installed  capacity  reached                 \n508 gigawatts and electricity generation totaled 2,470 terawatt-hours, an increase of 13% over \n2004. To meet the projected demand, installed capacity will have to increase by 240% from the \n2005 level to about 1,200 gigawatts in 2020. One of the key challenges to sustaining economic \ngrowth  is  to  improve  significantly  the  energy  intensity.4 The  Government\u2019s  highest  sector \npriorities are energy conservation and improved energy efficiency. \n \n3.   Despite  the  impressive  growth  and  achievements,  the  power  sector  faces  many \nchallenges, particularly: \n(i)  Increasing dependence on coal. The share of coal-fired power plants has been \nincreasing, while the hydropower contribution has been shrinking from about \n30%  of  installed  capacity  in  1990  to  26%  in  2004.  Hydropower\u2019s  share  of \ninstalled capacity is likely to decline to 24% by 2010. Coal-fired power plants \ncontributed about 81% of electricity generation in 2005, compared with 15% from \nHPPs. Rising coal consumption has created environmental problems. \n(ii)  Power  shortages.  Since  2001,  the  PRC  has  faced  power  shortages. \nAccelerated  capacity  addition  is  likely  to  overcome  this  problem  by  2007. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 9 December 2005.  \n2  Erlongshan subproject is scheduled for completion in 2007; Dagushan in 2009.  \n3  About one tenth that of the United States per capita energy consumption.  \n4  Energy intensity is the amount of primary energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). In the \nPRC, energy intensity is about 20\u2013100% more than OECD countries for many industrial processes. Source: World \nBank. 2006. China Quick Facts.  \n  Available: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/CHINAEXTN/0 \n ", "2   \nHowever,  the  greater  challenge  remains\u2014generating  the  power  needed  to \nquadruple the economy by 2020.  \n(iii)  Unbalanced power structure. More than 80% of the generation capacity is in \nthe eastern and central regions. Inadequate local generation capacity and weak \ninterregional  grid  connections  have  led  to  suboptimal  utilization  of  power \nresources.   \n \n4.  About 60% of the cities do not have acceptable air quality, and six of the world\u2019s most \npolluted cities are in the PRC. The rapid increase in coal consumption is one of the major \ncauses of poor air quality.5 Coal-fired power plant emissions6 comprise suspended particulates, \nsulfur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxide (NO ), and carbon dioxide (CO ). The increase in coal-fired \n2 x 2\npower plants will lead to more greenhouse gas emissions (CO ). Acid rain, caused primarily by \n2\nSO  and NO  emissions, falls on one third of the country. Environmental pollution is a huge \n2 x\nburden on the economy.7 Recognizing the energy-environment nexus, the Government enacted \nthe Renewable Energy Law to promote cleaner energy and electricity production which came \ninto effect on 1 January 2006. Further regulations for administration and tariffs have also been \nissued. Accelerated development of small- and medium-sized HPPs is a key element of the plan \nto promote cleaner energy production. \n \n5.   Like many other provinces, Gansu province has experienced rapid economic growth and \nassociated power shortages. The Gansu electricity network is part of the Northwest power grid, \nand is a net power importer from neighboring provinces. Some areas, such as the Hexi corridor, \nhave had chronic power shortages due to inadequate local generation capacity and the long \ndistance from power plants. Coal-fired thermal power plants are the main sources of electricity \nin Gansu province, while hydropower contributed 35% in 2004. Most of the cities in the province \ndo not have an acceptable ambient air quality (grade II national standard). The capital, Lanzhou, \nhad the fourth worst air pollution index of 47 key national environmental cities in 2004. A \ncombination  of  coal  combustion  and  desertification  causes  the  poor  air  quality.  The \ndevelopment of clean and renewable energy sources is one of the priorities of the provincial \ngovernment to reduce air pollution.  \n \n6.   Zhangye City8 is a poor area in the province with deficient electricity supply and bad air \nquality. Almost 80% of the 1.3 million people living in Zhangye City are classified as rural. Of its \nrural population, about 23% have income less than the provincial rural poverty line. Zhangye \nCity power network is part of the Hexi corridor network, which in turn is part of the Gansu and \nNorthwest power networks. Due to inadequate peaking capacity in the network, Zhangye City \nhas frequent power interruptions. Insufficient power generation capacity results in acute peak \npower shortages and poor quality of the power supply (low voltage and occasional blackouts). \nPower outages are common in rural areas.9 Poor quality and unreliable electricity supply inhibit \nindustrial and commercial activities, and constrain economic growth and job creation in rural \nareas. The unreliable supply also promotes switching to more polluting fuels. Air quality, in \nterms of suspended particulates, was grade III. \n                                                 \n5  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. In 2004, it produced about 2 billion tons of coal.  \n6  Emissions can be significantly reduced through (i) improved coal technologies, (ii) substitution of low sulfur coal, \nand (iii) flue gas desulfurization. \n7  A World Bank estimate suggests $54 billion per year in environmental pollution and associated health problems in \nthe PRC. \n8  Zhangye City is an administrative unit under the provincial government, it includes five counties with mainly rural \nareas. \n9  Rural areas generally are connected at the far end of the distribution network. During supply-demand imbalances, \nthey are switched off first. ", "  3\n7.  The Heihe River is the second largest inland river in the PRC and the largest in the Hexi \ncorridor.  Traversing  more  than  800  kilometers,  the  river  passes  through  Qinghai  province, \nGansu province, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The section from the Huangzhang \nTemple to the Yingluo gorge in Zhangye City is an excellent source of hydropower generation. \nThe Heihe River Development Plan has identified eight potential cascade sites\u2014seven of which \nare  in  Zhangye  City\u2014with  total  hydropower  potential  of  about  800  MW.  Within  the                        \n11th Five-Year Plan, the Government identified the accelerated development of the Heihe River \ncascade  scheme  as  a  key  local  initiative  to  alleviate  chronic  power  shortages  in  an         \nenvironment-friendly manner, and to spur economic development of rural areas within Zhangye \nCity. Of the cascade\u2019s seven schemes, two are in operation, while two are under construction10 \nand scheduled for completion in 2007. To achieve its target, the Government is seeking ADB \nassistance for the accelerated development of the next two run-of-river hydropower schemes in \nErlongshan and Dagushan.  \n \n8.  The Heihe River cascade scheme will provide a source of clean and renewable energy \ncloser  to  the  power-deficient  rural  communities  of  Zhangye  City.  A  least-cost  generation \nplanning  study  was  carried  out  in  2003  for  Gansu  province  under  an  ADB-financed  loan \n(footnote 10). This study identified medium-sized HPPs as the least-cost generation option. \nThese schemes will replace the coal-fired power plants, thereby reducing harmful emissions. \nThe Xiaogushan hydropower scheme, financed under another ADB loan, is an example of this \nsuccessful transition. This project has contracted carbon emission reductions under the clean \ndevelopment mechanism (CDM) to the Prototype Carbon Fund of the World Bank.11  \n \n9.  The development of renewable and clean energy sources to provide direct benefits to \nthe rural poor is a priority of ADB\u2019s energy policy. Further, the acceleration of rural development \nby strengthening rural infrastructure and services is a strategic focus of ADB\u2019s program for the \nPRC. The strategy, designed to support the 11th Five-Year Plan, aims for balanced regional \ndevelopment through physical and social infrastructure improvement. In the energy sector, the \nstrategy  focuses  on  supporting  energy  conservation  and  mitigating  adverse  environmental \nimpacts of capacity expansion.  \n \n10.  ADB has been helping Gansu province develop a complete array of renewable energy \nsources.  Erlonghsan  hydropower  subproject  feasibility  was  approved  by  the  provincial \nauthorities in October 2005. The proposed Dagushan hydropower subproject pre-feasibility was \ncarried out with a continuing ADB advisory TA.12 Under this TA, a pilot stalk gasifier to provide \ncooking gas to rural households, and to generate electricity, was implemented successfully. In \naddition, Gansu was one of the target provinces that identified clean energy projects under a \ncluster TA.13 The proposed project will be designed to complement the continuing interventions \nin the energy sector, and to maximize the impact on the rural economy. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project impact will be a reliable and environmentally clean energy supply supporting \neconomic growth in the rural areas of Gansu province. The TA outcome will be to produce an \nagreed project design, feasibility study, and implementation arrangements suitable for ADB \nfinancing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA scope will include the phased preparation of the Erlongshan and Dagushan \nhydropower subprojects, starting with the Erlongshan subproject. The consultant will (i) review \nand update the relevant studies, analyses, and data on subproject feasibility reports; (ii) review \ndemand forecasts, and undertake a least-cost analysis for additional generation capacity in the \nHexi corridor network and Gansu province; (iii) prepare project loan proposals for consideration \nby the Government and ADB, including the necessary documents under the safeguard policy; \nand (iv) identify the potential for carbon emission reductions under CDM and other incentives \navailable under the Global Environment Fund. \n \n13.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  that  need  to  be  considered  for  successful  TA \nimplementation include (i) change in Government priorities, (ii) lack of adequate and timely \nprovision of data, (iii) delay in submission of required studies, (iv) delay in consultant selection, \nand (v) poor consultant performance. The Gansu provincial government has agreed to provide \nadequate  counterpart  support  and  data  when  needed.  Close  coordination  among  the \nconsultants, executing and implementing agencies, and ADB will mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA will cost $650,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 equivalent on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining $150,000 \nthrough in-kind contributions, including office accommodation and facilities, counterpart staff, \nand data and other information needed for the TA. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The  Gansu  provincial  government  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  Zhangye  City \ngovernment, through the Heihe Hydropower Company, will be the Implementing Agency. The \nZhangye City government will provide a TA project director for day-to-day management of TA \nimplementation. A steering committee or a lead group will be established and begin functioning \nwithin 2 weeks of commencement of TA activities to oversee and guide the TA implementation. \nThe  committee  will  comprise  representatives  of  relevant  departments  and  agencies  of  the \nZhangye City government.    \n \n16.  The TA scope will include both subprojects. However, to match with the subprojects\u2019 \nimplementation schedule, the TA will have two parts that will be implemented over 10 months. \nThe first part of the TA will focus on preparation of the Erlongshan subproject, which is expected \nto start in May 2006 and be completed by August 2006. For this part, international consultants \nwill  provide  4  person-months  of  services,  while  domestic  consultants  will  provide                        ", "  5\n10 person-months. The second part of the TA, which will review feasibility studies and prepare \nthe Dagushan subproject for ADB financing, will begin in July 2006 and be completed by                   \nFebruary 2007. International consultants will provide 6 person-months of services for this part of \nthe TA, while domestic consultants will provide 16 person-months. The consultants will procure \nthe office equipment, which they will deliver to the Implementing Agency at the conclusion of the \nTA. \n \n17.  ADB will engage the international and domestic consultants in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. ADB will recruit \nindividual consultants directly to fast-track their mobilization during the first part of the TA.
