THE WAVES PROGRAM IN PACIFIC COUNTRIES  \n \n1.  The Cluster Technical Assistance for Gender Mainstreaming and Gender Initiatives in \nNonsovereign Operations, approved in November 2020, aims to provide capacity building support \nto PSOD programs and projects with adequate resources to develop capacities and knowledge \nin response to the greater attention given by international development partners and finance \ninstitutions, including ADB, to a more systematic inclusion of measures supporting gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment as part of private sector development projects. As such, the technical \nassistance (TA) cluster proposes to host under the same umbrella different PSOD initiatives to \nsupport gender mainstreaming, including supporting access to finance for women-owned small \nand medium-sized enterprises (WSMEs) in the Pacific under the Women Accelerating Vibrant \nEnterprises in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Program (WAVES) with the resources obtained \nfrom the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi).1  \n \n2.  The Pacific component of the WAVES program was designed to unlock the growth \npotential of WSMEs, overcoming gender-specific constraints in the Pacific by building capacity \nacross the entrepreneurial eco-system, in partnership with governments, the private sector, \nincluding financial institutions (FIs) and women\u2019s businesses, to open new doors and create an \nempowering environment for WSMEs to grow and scale up. For that purpose, ADB obtained funds \nfrom We-Fi in April 2019 to support access to finance for WSMEs through FIs in the two largest \neconomies of the region, Fiji and Papua New Guinea (PNG). The We-Fi governing committee \napproved a comprehensive program that included four activities that are summarized under the \nproposed Technical Assistance for WAVES Program\u2019s Private Sector Development in Pacific \nCountries, as Subproject 2 of the Cluster Technical Assistance for Gender Mainstreaming and \nGender Initiatives in Nonsovereign Operations.  \n \n3.  Constraints faced by WSMEs growing their businesses and accessing financing have \nbeen largely documented: a combination of gender-biased norms (e.g. misperceptions/ bias of \nloan officers), and lack of access to opportunities due to prevailing gender inequalities, such as \nunpaid  care  responsibilities,  gender-based  violence,  and  discrimination  against  female \nparticipation. This results in lower levels of financial and digital literacy, limited opportunities for \nnetworking, mentorship, training, and therefore, more difficulties in accessing financing.2 These \nconstraints are further exacerbated in times of economic downturns or external shocks such as \nthe one provoked by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. FIs also face difficulties, serving \nWSMEs with traditional lending practices such as non-differentiated approaches which are heavily \nreliant on traditional collateral requirements of land and tangible assets, the majority of which is \nnot owned by women.  \n \n4.  In the Pacific, governments have enacted a series of policy and regulatory reforms to \nsupport business development, which have had some direct positive spillovers for women. \nThrough ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI), governments across the region \nhave introduced secured transactions laws (Fiji, PNG, Vanuatu, Tonga, Solomon Islands), online \nbusiness registries (Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu), and developed policies on \npublic-private partnerships (PNG, Fiji, Tonga). In Fiji, the Fiji Development Bank and the National \nCentre for Small and Micro Enterprise Development top-up loans to small businesses (up to $500) \n \n1  The Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative is a groundbreaking partnership that aims to unlock financing for \nwomen-led and women-owned businesses in developing countries. We-Fi\u2019s partners include 14 donor governments, \nsix multilateral development banks as implementing partners, and numerous other stakeholders in the public and \nprivate sector around the world. \n2  ADB/AusAid/New  Zealand  Aid  Program.  Pacific  Private  Sector  Development  Initiative. \nhttp://www.adbpsdi.org/p/what-is-psdi.html   \n ", "2   \nprovided that at least 40% of the loan is obtained from other financial institutions. However, \nprograms targeting women\u2019s businesses have tended to focus on microenterprise support such \nas that offered by the Fiji Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, which provides \ngrants of up to $2,500 to individuals or groups of women working collectively to start up small \ninformal businesses.  \n \n5.  The WAVES Pacific program seeks to address the above-mentioned constraints by:  \ni) supporting the structuring of an innovative blended finance product; ii) strengthening the \ncapacity of partner financial institutions; iii) supporting the development of gender-responsive \ndigital finance solutions in partnership with local financial institutions; and iv) developing the \ncapacity of WSMEs. These are the four subcomponents that were originally approved by We-Fi. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECTS \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n6.  This TA subproject follows the recent approval of the TA for Gender Mainstreaming and \nGender Initiatives in Nonsovereign Operations Cluster report (TA Cluster), which is  comprised of \nfive subprojects that focus on: (i) supporting private sector projects categorized Effective Gender \nMainstreaming  or  Gender  Equity  Theme  under  the  ADB\u2019s  categorization  system  in  the \nimplementation of their gender action plans; (ii) increasing women\u2019s access to finance in the \nPacific  for  women  businesses  through  the  WAVES  Program;  (iii)  enhancing  gender \nmainstreaming in climate finance projects under the Australian Climate Financing Partnership;  \n(iv) developing knowledge and tools to promote gender-lens financing by financial institutions; \nand (v) enhancing gender mainstreaming in venture capital financing operations. The TA Cluster \nspecifies that the subprojects are not mutually dependent and may be presented and approved \nin any order. Not all of these five subprojects may materialize and/or additional subprojects may \nbe developed over the course of the TA Cluster.  \n \nB.  Subprojects Scope \n \n7.  The WAVES Pacific program includes four activities as originally approved by We-Fi. \nThese  include:  i)  supporting  the  structuring  of  an  innovative  blended  finance  product;  \nii) strengthening the capacity of partner financial institutions; iii) supporting the development of \ngender-responsive digital finance solutions in partnership with local financial institutions; and  \niv) developing the capacity of WSMEs. \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities  \n \n1.  Output 1: Improved capacities of ADB private sector clients to develop and \nimplement gender mainstreaming initiatives and gender action plans  \n \n1.1. Activity 1: Structuring of an innovative blended finance product supported  \n \n8.  Given the structural constraints faced by WSMEs to access finance in Pacific countries, \nblended finance is needed to provide the necessary incentives for FIs to lend to WSMEs, as well \nas for WSMEs to overcome some of the challenges, such as lack of access to capital. This activity \nwill aim to support increasing access to finance for WSMEs by structuring an innovative blended \n ", "3 \nfinance product in partnership with one or several FIs.3 Such product could be in the form of a \ngender bond, direct capital to specific FIs committed to increasing their portfolio of WSMEs, a \npatient capital equity-grant fund to support capital for WSMEs, a credit guarantee fund to cover \nthe credit risks of WSMEs, or other similar products.  \n \n9.  This  activity  will  finance  all  aspects  related  to  ADB\u2019s  cost  for  the  structuring  and \nmanagement of the innovative blended finance product, including but not limited to consultants, \nfund managers fees, legal fees, potential rating fees, social audits, marketing materials, and in \nthe case of the gender bond, potential registration in the local stock exchange, potential credit \nrating of the bond, social audit, and other required activities. ADB will seek a project contribution \nfrom project counterparts as much as possible.  \n \n10.  As a first step, a market study will be undertaken to assess the state of the women\u2019s \nentrepreneurship sector and the enabling environment (both private and public) supporting \nWSMEs in order to determine the best-suited blended finance product. The study will aim to \nidentify the characteristics of WSMEs and the current constraints faced by banks to serve this \nsegment as a means to design a strategy to effectively serve this segment either through FIs \nsupported by blended finance products or an alternative instrument such as a patient capital \nequity-grant fund, or a combination of both.  \n \n1.2. Activity 2: capacity of partner financial institutions strengthened  \n   \n11.  To  effectively  serve  the  WSME  segment,  FIs  need  to  understand  the  specific \ncharacteristics and needs of WSMEs. Research indicates that men and women are likely to have \ndifferent spending and saving priorities, different (foreseen and unforeseen) cash-flow needs at \ncertain points in their personal lives and professional life-cycles, and different attitudes towards \nrisk and growth. Further, when linked to the sector in which WSMEs operate (for example, trade \nversus agriculture), the needs may differ.  \n \n12.  This activity will strengthen the FIs\u2019 ability to serve WSMEs and develop the specific \nskillset and processes needed to assist this target segment. FIs will receive support to build their \ninternal capacity to originate and service WSME loans, such as, conducting baseline gender gap \nanalyses, preparing gender action plans, and supporting its implementation. It can also provide \nassistance in the development of gender-responsive products, likely in combination with activity \n3 described below. In the case of a gender bond issuance, the issuer FI will also receive capacity \nto comply with the Social Bonds Principles (SBP) (Voluntary Process Guidelines for Issuing Social \nBonds) by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).4 \n \n1.3. Activity 3: gender-responsive digital finance solutions supported \n \n13.  The lack of infrastructure in Pacific countries, especially those with remote rural areas \nsuch as PNG, makes digital finance a relevant solution for increasing access to finance for \nWSMEs. This component will build on ADB\u2019s experience of supporting the Bank of PNG in the \ncreation of a national digital ID and the partnership that ADB has established with a local \nimplementing partner, as well as ADB\u2019s sovereign programs targeting the development of WSMEs. \n \n3  FIs will be selected according to specific criteria, such as (i) track-record, willingness and management buy-in to \nfurther improve their financing to WSMEs, (ii) implementation and execution capacity, (iii) need for blended finance \nin compliance with the blended finance principles. \n4 International  Capital  Market  Association.  Social  Bond  Principles.  https://www.icmagroup.org/green-social-and-\nsustainability-bonds/social-bond-principles-sbp/.   \n ", "4   \nThe WAVES funds will be used to implement some of the digital finance solutions that have \nalready been identified with an emphasis on the needs of WSMEs.  \n \n14.  Many FIs and women\u2019s businesses in ADB\u2019s developing member countries have not yet \ndigitized their service delivery models. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to face \nthe challenge of digital transformation and ADB will seek to support FIs and WSMEs in addressing \nthis opportunity.5 FIs will be identified and selected based on specific criteria, among others their \nneed for digitization of business processes, their focus on increasing finance to WSMEs, and their \nmanagement\u2019s buy-in for the digital transformation. In the first phase, one such activity, as \nprovided under this subproject, will be to conduct a market scoping and needs assessment for \ninnovative financial technologies relevant for FIs that intend to increase their gender-responsive \nfinance portfolio. These would be specific technologies that facilitate greater access to finance for \nwomen or women\u2019s businesses. This can be done in cooperation with one FI or several FIs in a \nspecific country or region, or on a stand-alone basis. Based on the assessment, an FI can be \nsupported through ADB\u2019s technology platform to identify suitable cutting-edge digital solutions for \n\u201clast mile\u201d service delivery targeting WSMEs with the potential to pilot such solutions.6 Such efforts \nwould address issues such as a lack of infrastructure and connectivity, challenges of remote \nlocations, efficiency and cost factors and gender disparities.  \n \n15.  In addition, support can also be provided directly to an FI through information technology \nassessments as well as capacity building for specific gender lens financing topics and digital \nsolutions such as alternative credit scoring models that incorporate gender specific data.7 This \ncould be in the form of digitizing credit scoring models or integrating gender-specific data in the \nalgorithms. Monitoring of the FI and evaluating the results from this work will also be a necessary \npart of the process to assess the impact of these initiatives.8 \n \n2.  Output 2: Enhanced business and other skills of women-owned small and \nmedium-sized enterprises \n \n16.  Emerging evidence from COVID-19 suggests that in lower- and low-income countries, lost \nincome will result in an increase in relative poverty for informal workers and their families and that \ncompared to men\u2019s lives, women\u2019s economic and productive lives are disproportionately and \ndifferently affected.9 The hardest hit sectors include retail trade and service industries, such as \nstreet vending and domestic work- typically low-wage jobs that rely on in-person connections and \noften carried out by women.10 A survey on the impact of COVID-19 on women\u2019s businesses in \nPNG has found that 40.9% of smaller or semi-formal businesses have reported a temporary halt \nin operations.11 \n \n \n5  First, focus will be on supporting FIs which are already ADB clients or potential new clients and have contacted ADB \nfor support. The next phase will cover individual women\u2019s businesses as well. \n6  This will be done in cooperation with ADB\u2019s Information Technology Department. See challenges.adb.org or \ndigital.adb.org. \n7  In cooperation with the FI, it can be decided whether ADB\u2019s support comes in the form of consulting services, support \nthrough hackathon or sandbox programs or contribution to the FI\u2019s own assessment, preparation, and implementation \nof new technologies. Cost matching from the FI will be sought as much as possible. \n8  It is envisaged that activities will be coordinated with REG TRTA: Technical Assistance for The Women\u2019s Financing \nMarketplace, subproject 2: Innovation and Technology. \n9  UN Women 2020, Policy Brief: The Impact of COVID-19 on Women, 9 April 2020. \n10  Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), #3 Social Protection Responses to COVID-\n19, 2020. \n11  CIBE 2020.

While access to finance to adapt business models to the \u201cnew normal\u201d environment and \noperate more digitally is one challenge (such as e.g. using mobile payment channels, advertising \nthrough Facebook, selling through e-commerce platforms) that needs to be addressed, another \nchallenge is that often WSMEs lack financial literacy and the skills and capacities to present \nbankable projects. The TA funds earmarked for PNG under this subproject will support WSMEs \nin PNG identified in partnership with FIs, through various means, and conduct tailormade training \nand coaching sessions for WSMEs in digital financial literacy, business planning, and debt \nmanagement and other areas, as needed, to sustainably develop their businesses. A suitable \ntraining provider will be selected, and existing training curriculum and material will be adjusted to \nmeet the needs of the WSMEs and the new online format. Providing training and coaching \nsessions online in the current environment will reach a wider audience and can be screened \nacross multiple countries and regions. It is expected that some on-site coaching will remain, once \nthe COVID-19 situation has improved. Further feedback from FIs on requirements for lending will \nalso be incorporated.12 \n \n18.  WSMEs will also be connected through networks (e.g. PNG Business Coalition of Women, \nBusiness  Advocacy  Network  or  Centre  for  International  Private  Enterprise)  and  potential \naccelerators that support WSMEs through tailor-made support and market access possibilities, \nas well as through enhanced sharing. Women\u2019s business initiatives in PNG are quite strong and \nwill be excellent partners for the development of training and coaching, as well as supporting \nnetworking  activities.  Networking  for  WSMEs  and  FIs  can  also  be  expanded  through  the \nMarketplace.13 \n \nD.  Cost and Indicative Financing \n \n19.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $1,250,000 of which all will be financed on a grant \nbasis by We-Fi under the WAVES Program in accordance with the trust fund regulations.14  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA will run until December 2024 in line with the approved implementation period of \nthe WAVES Program. ADB will administer the TA and its Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s, \nFinancial Institutions Division will implement it in consultation with PSOD Gender Team and \nSDCC to recruit specific consultant services for each output activity and reporting to We-Fi. \nDisbursements under this TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nHandbook (2020, as amended from time to time).  \n \n21.  Consulting services. Individual consultants (national/international) will be recruited by \nPSOD/PSFI in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and the associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. A firm may \nalso be recruited using the quality and cost-based selection method. A single-source selection \nmay also be considered, subject to required approvals, should specific expertise be required. \nShopping procedures may be used as appropriate for non-consulting services. The estimated \ncost and requisite fields of expertise15 are indicative, and estimates will be finalized prior to \nadvertisement. 16 Output based and/or lump-sum contracts will be considered but time-based \n \n12  It is envisaged that the training and coaching is coordinated with activities under REG TRTA: Technical Assistance \nfor Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace, subproject 3: Capacity Building.  \n13  REG C-TRTA 0050 Technical Assistance for the Women's Financing Marketplace. \n14 An implied waiver for cost recovery is deemed received. \n15  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  As applicable, fixed out-of-pocket expenses, for administrative efficiency and to simplify the disbursement process \nwill be used.  \n ", "6   \ncontracts will be used, as appropriate. Advance contracting will be considered to for early \nrecruitment purposes. No contracts will be signed with consultants until subprojects have been \napproved. \n \n22.  Asset turnover or disposal arrangement upon TA completion. If goods are procured \nby ADB, ADB may turn them over to the recipient or TASU will follow the disposal procedure \nindicated in AO 4.02 in consultation with OAS. \n \n23.  Co-Financier Requirements. This TA subproject of the C-TRTA Technical Assistance \nfor Gender Mainstreaming and Gender Initiatives in Nonsovereign Operations will be entirely \nfinanced by We-Fi. As such, eligibility, implementation, monitoring and reporting of activities will \nbe carried out in accordance with the Financial Procedures Agreement signed between ADB and \nthe International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) as the We-Fi trustee in \nJanuary 2018.    \n \n \n   \n ", "7 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/LinkedDocs/?id=54391-003-TAReport \n \n1.
