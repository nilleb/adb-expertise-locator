INTRODUCTION \n1.  Myanmar\u2019s economy has reached a turning point, potentially separating a history of low \ngrowth with a phase of quick catch-up. Modernization of the country\u2019s transport system can be \nan engine for such transformation. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study showed that \nimproving international and national transport systems and services can increase Myanmar\u2019s \ngross domestic product by more than 20% by 2030.1 Improving transport connectivity and rural \naccessibility will raise the competitiveness of agricultural products and reduce rural poverty. \nInvestment  needs  are  large  because  of  the  low  quality  and  poor  condition  of  existing \ninfrastructure. Addressing them will take time since transport institutions require strengthening.  \n \n2.  The government has asked ADB for policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to \nhelp design transport sector reforms and modernization plans. As a first step toward assisting \nMyanmar, ADB has been preparing a transport sector policy study.2 This follow-on TA is a \nsecond step, which builds on the early findings of the initial study and the policy dialogue \ndeveloped. This report is based on understandings reached with the Government of Myanmar \nduring the TA fact-finding mission fielded in July 2014. It reflects agreements reached on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In its current state, Myanmar\u2019s transport sector will impede the country\u2019s economic \ntakeoff. The transport infrastructure compares favorably with neighboring countries in terms of \nquantity,  but  it  is  largely  obsolete  and  dilapidated.  Myanmar\u2019s  road  network  is  extensive \n(148,700 kilometers), but only 20% is paved and only about 10% is in good to fair condition. \nSimilarly, the rail network (5,988 kilometers) is longer than that of any Southeast Asian country, \nbut  train  speeds  rarely  exceed  30  kilometers  per  hour  because  of  poor  track  condition. \nEconomic  distortions  have  long  hampered  the  development  of  transport  services\u2014lack  of \naccess to foreign exchange; high license costs for vehicle imports; a subsidized but rationed \nfuel market; government control over allocation of freight; and subsistence of loss-making, low-\nproductivity public transport operators. From 1990 to 2010, the quantity of heavy trucks in \nMyanmar grew at 2.5% annually, well below the pace of economic growth. In 2010, there were \nonly 4.5 cars per 1,000 Myanmar people. Until the early 2010s, transport was cheap but of low \nquality for people and businesses that relied on public road, rail, or river transport operators; it \nwas expensive and unreliable for those who availed of smaller private operators.   \n \n4.  The government has removed some constraints through recent reforms. From 2011 to \n2013,  it  abolished  the  fuel  subsidization  system,  gradually  facilitated  the  import  of  foreign \nvehicles, reduced their import costs, and freed the market for freight and public transport. It also \nraised public transport operator tariffs, bringing them closer to costs. As a result, private sector \ntransport services and personal transport means have boomed. From 2011 to 2014, the number \nof cars increased by 70%, and the number of motorcycles and trucks doubled. In 2014, the \ngovernment approved the country\u2019s first transport master plan.4 The plan identifies long-term \n                                                 \n1  D. Roland-Holst and C.Y.

Naypyidaw. \n ", "2   \ninfrastructure  upgrade  needs  and  broad  policy  directions.  It  recommends  a  package  of \ninvestments of $25 billion to be implemented over 15 years.  \n \n5.  Implementation of the transport master plan will pose significant challenges as key \nproblems remain. Policies governing the transport sector still reflect a paradigm in which the \ngovernment organizes and directly provides transport infrastructure and services, even though \nits role has dwindled in practice. Coherent policy principles are needed, clarifying the role of the \nstate  in  asset  ownership,  organization,  delivery,  and  control  of  transport  services.  The \norganization  of  the  central  government  is  another  constraint.  Overlaps  exist  in  the \nresponsibilities of the Ministry of Transport (MOT), Ministry of Construction, and Ministry of Rail \nTransportation,  as  well  as  major  gaps,  particularly  in  planning  and  regulatory  capacity. \nFragmentation has limited the sector\u2019s ability to formulate and implement significant plans or \nreforms, and could constrain its ability to handle such a large investment program. \n \n6.  In parallel, the transport sector has suffered from underfunding and misallocation of \ninvestments. Based on investment plans, it is estimated that Myanmar needs to raise its annual \ninvestment effort in the transport sector from 1% to about 3%\u20134% of its gross domestic product. \nThis level of financing is ambitious but comparable with what other East or Southeast Asian \ncountries (Japan, People\u2019s Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Thailand, Viet Nam) invested \nduring fast growth periods. However, the transport sector has received a dwindling share of \ngovernment  budgets.  The  country  needs  to  mobilize  other  financing  channels,  such  as \nearmarked  taxes,  state-owned  enterprise  debt,  private  sector,  and  development  partner \nresources. Resources have also been focused on extending infrastructure networks in remote \nareas. Mechanisms ensuring efficient prioritization are needed. \n \n7.  Finally, state-owned transport enterprises involved in the provision of transport services \nhave  been  facing  a  severe  crisis.  The  market  share  of  state-owned  transport  enterprises \ndropped from 50% in 1990 to about 10% in 2013 for passengers and from 25% to less than 3% \nfor freight. The decline had been gradual since the early 1990s, but accelerated after the first \nset of transport sector reforms. The state rail operator\u2014Myanma Railways\u2014lost 30% of its \nfreight  and  passenger  traffic  over  2010\u20132013.  The  state  river  operator\u2014Inland  Water \nTransport\u2014lost 75% of its passenger traffic and 55% of its freight traffic. The public bus and \ntruck operator\u2014Road Transport\u2014mainly only caters to government transport needs. These \nthree companies are making operational losses, reaching 70% of revenues in the case of \nMyanma Railways. \n \n8.  The transport sector policy study has helped identify promising paths for reform and \nmodernization. To achieve the plan\u2019s objectives, the government and ADB agree that each \ntransport sector institution needs to be restructured, refocused, and strengthened to manage \nand  develop  Myanmar\u2019s  transport  sector  economically.  While  doing  so,  foreign  experience \nshould be considered. Sector restructuring is understood to involve (i) corporatizing and partly \nprivatizing  state-owned  enterprises  under  MOT;  (ii)  transforming  Public  Works,  under  the \nMinistry of Construction, into a government department focused on highways, after corporatizing \nits construction activities; (iii) restructuring Myanma Railways to make it more autonomous, \ncommercially oriented, and financially sustainable; (iv) increasing private sector involvement \nthrough concessions and build\u2013operate\u2013transfer mechanisms; (v) decentralizing road network \nmanagement; (vi) refocusing the ministries in charge of transport on policy-making planning and \nregulation; and (vii) creating new mechanisms to fund the transport sector. Better coordination is \nneeded between the ministries in charge of transport. The three ministries in charge of transport \nhave set up a Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) to implement the plan. Discussions with \nsector stakeholders suggest that their potential merger should also be considered.  \n ", "3 \n \n9.  The restructuring of Public Works and Myanma Railways will be major tasks, during \nwhich it will be useful to consider foreign experience. For instance, Public Works still carries out \nmost road works with its own equipment, 25,000 staff, and hired labor. Its work techniques and \nprocesses  are  largely  outdated.  Modernizing  the  road  sector  will  involve  technical  and \norganization  transformations\u2014from  labor-intensive  to  mechanized  works,  from  reactive \nmaintenance to asset management, and from public to private delivery. Road departments in \nmany other countries have successfully undergone similar transitions.   \n \n10.  Modernizing Myanma Railways will also be a long-term agenda, with strong economic, \nsocial, and environmental benefits. It is a state-owned company with about 20,000 staff. The \nquality of its services is limited by the low standards of the network and lack of rolling stock. One \nof the reasons for this status is that Myanma Railways has been unable to generate the \nresources needed to self-finance its modernization. There is a growing understanding within the \ngovernment that the company needs some form of restructuring and productivity improvements \nto become financially sustainable, attract private investment, and improve the quality of its \nservices. Eventually, the company will need to modernize its track, rolling stock, and systems \ncomprehensively. \n \n11.  Lessons. Major transport sector reforms can take 5\u201310 years to implement. To be \neffective, development partner support needs to be framed as long-term engagements where \ninvestment  resources  are  combined  with  a  robust  medium-term  policy  framework  and  TA \nprogram.  As  of  2014,  only  ADB  and  Japan  have  developed  significant  engagements  in \nMyanmar\u2019s transport sector. Japan is taking a comprehensive approach, which includes the \npreparation of national and Yangon transport master plans as well as large investments in the \nrail sector. ADB has taken the lead in policy and institutional reform dialogue, and has started \nseveral  operations  in  the  road  transport  subsector.  Once  the  reform  and  modernization \nstrategies  are defined,  ADB  and  the  government  may  consider  setting  up  a  medium-term \nprogram of TA and investments to facilitate sector development. ADB is already considering \nfinancing project preparatory TA for transport sector modernization in 2015 followed by a loan in \n2017 to support reform implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be a more effective and sustainable management of the transport sector \nin Myanmar. The outcome will be improved policies and actionable plans for reforming and \nmodernizing the transport sector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The technical assistance will be implemented under the following four outputs. \n \n14.  Output 1: Improved transport sector architecture defined. The TA will advise and \nsupport the government through the JCC to formulate common policies and prepare institutional \nreforms. This will include (i) helping formulate a transport sector policy statement, stating the \nprinciples governing transport sector organization and economic regulation, to complement and \nclarify  the  policy  directions  of  the  transport  master  plan;  (ii)  identifying  and  advising  the \ngovernment on changes to the transport sector\u2019s institutional structure, e.g., a potential merger \nof  the  three  ministries  in  charge  of  transport,  a  realignment  of  selected  organizations  to \neliminate gaps and overlaps, and the creation of stronger institutions in charge of planning and \n ", "4   \nregulation;  (iii)  defining  new  mission  statements,  responsibilities,  objectives,  and  internal \nstructures for key sector institutions in transition; (iv) improving the processes guiding project \nselection and linking budget allocation with approved plans in the transport sector, e.g., the \ndefinition of a formal project cycle for transport investments, and a template for preparing \nfeasibility  study  reports;  (v) identifying  and  advising  on  financial  mechanisms  to  fund  the \ntransport  sector,  e.g.,  new  fees  or  taxes,  potentially  earmarked,  creation  of  off-budget \nmaintenance, and investment or debt funds; and (vi) determining a realistic plan for rolling out \nthe changes, e.g., support for drafting a law reorganizing the sector.  \n \n15.  Output  2:  Restructuring  and  rationalization  strategy  for  Myanma  Railways \nprepared. The government has identified Myanma Railways for restructuring and rationalization \nwhile being retained under government ownership, with the objective of improving its financial \nperformance. The TA will advise the government on the institutional and financial restructuring \nof Myanma Railways, and help identify and consider productivity enhancement measures. This \nwill include (i) determining a suitable model for reorganizing the railway sector, its governance, \nand the role of the private sector, e.g., corporatization of Myanma Railways, creation of a \nrailway department and regulatory entities, reorganizing or splitting Myanma Railways along \nbusiness lines, and outsourcing of non-core activities to the private sector; (ii) determining the \nfinancial conditions for such restructuring, including treatment of land and other assets, long-\nterm debt, pensions, recapitalization needs, and public service obligation payments; and (iii) \ncreating a rationalization plan aimed at raising productivity. Productivity enhancement measures \nmay involve (i) rationalization of rail services, network used, track and track equipment, and \nrelated  maintenance  strategy;  (ii)  rationalization  of  traction  and  rolling  stock  and  related \nmaintenance  practices;  (iii)  improvements  in  operational  practices  and  investments  in \ninformation systems; (iv) marketing and pricing changes; (v) rationalization of the workforce; and \n(vi) internal reorganization of Myanma Railways. As a key input to the strategy, the TA will assist \nMyanma Railways in setting up a cost allocation model. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Reengineering  plan  for  Public  Works  prepared.  The  government  is \nconsidering separating Public Works\u2019 road sector activities into a Department of Highways, and \ncorporatizing its road construction activities. The TA will advise on how to set up the new \norganizational structure and its key business processes, particularly those related to dealing \nwith private sector participation. This will include (i) determining a new organizational structure \nfor  Public Works;  (ii) determining  the  approach  toward  developing  the  private construction \nindustry,  including  corporatizing  or  divesting  Public  Work\u2019s  construction  activities  and  the \nresulting corporate structure; (iii) developing robust procurement procedures to deal with private \ncontractors; (iv) advising on how to improve Public Works\u2019 program for managing tolled roads \nthrough  private  contracts;  and  (v)  preparing  action  plans  to  reengineer  Public  Works\u2019  key \nbusiness processes, e.g., design and supervision, maintenance planning, management and \ndelivery, information systems and processes, and investment planning and budgeting. \n \n17.  Output 4: Business restructuring strategies for selected state-owned enterprises \nunder the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Rail Transportation prepared. The TA \nwill advise the government on how to restructure selected state-owned transport enterprises. \nTwo enterprises, Inland Waterway Transport and Road Transport, will require specific support \ngiven their degraded market and financial situation. The TA will advise on options for their \nrestructuring, including partial to complete sale, joint ventures, and equity support from the \ngovernment. The TA will also facilitate the preparation of business plans, based on the preferred \nrestructuring strategy by the government. \n \n ", "5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation and supplies, \ndomestic transportation for site visits, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The JCC at ministerial level will serve as a high-level steering committee. The director \ngeneral-level JCC will act as an implementation coordination committee. The committees will \nrequest participation at a similar level from other concerned ministries such as the Ministry of \nFinance and the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development, when the meeting \nagenda requires it. Important policy documents will be submitted to the cabinet. Three technical \nworking groups will be set up, covering transport-wide institutional issues, railways, and roads. \nEach participating ministry will nominate a counterpart acting as focal point for activities related \nto the ministry. For administrative matters, MOT will act as executing agency for the TA. The TA \nwill be implemented from 1 January 2015 to 31 August 2016. \n   \n20.  ADB will recruit consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). TA implementation is anticipated to require 31 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultancy,  and  48  person-months  of  national  consultancy.  The \nfollowing international expertise will be required: institutional development specialist (8 person-\nmonths), road sector management specialist (6 person-months), railway specialist (6 person-\nmonths), railway costing specialist (4 person-months), restructuring specialist (4 person-months), \nand  resource  people  (3  person-months).  A  national  coordinator  will  also  be  recruited  for \n18 person-months. ADB will recruit these consultants using individual consultant selection.5 \nADB will also recruit a think tank through single source selection to facilitate consultations; carry \nout data, policy, and legal research; prepare legal documents or regulations; and manage \ntranslation of documents and organization of workshops.6 All procurement under the TA will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Transport Sector Reform and \nModernization, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n5  This is appropriate given (i) the need to ensure the high quality and cost-efficiency of advice, for an assignment \nunder which a consulting company may not have specialized expertise in all the fields covered, (ii) the limited \noverlaps between the assignments and the different time frames for their provision, (iii) the need for flexibility in the \ndefinition of the consultant\u2019s outputs, and (iv) the need for a quick start of work to ensure that substantial outputs \ncan be produced sufficiently ahead of the 2015 Myanmar general elections. \n6  The  Centre  for  Economic  and  Social  Development  of  the  Myanmar  Development  Resource  Institute  is  a \nnongovernment research institute founded by advisors to the President. The think tank is regularly tasked by the \ngovernment to prepare economic and institutional reform proposals. It has direct access to decision makers, and is \nreputed as being nonpartisan. Single source selection is appropriate given the small contract value, the dearth of \nqualified consulting firms in Myanmar, and the center\u2019s unique experience.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2020    Assumptions \nMore effective and  More effective transport  Government  Government reform \nsustainable  sector architecture in place   organizational structure  agenda is sustained. \nmanagement of the \nState-owned enterprises  Budget laws  Development partner \ntransport sector  \nrestructuring process  support for reform \ncompleted  implementation \navailable \nRisk \nLoss of momentum for \nproposed reforms \nfollowing 2015 elections \nOutcome  By 2016    Risks \nImproved policies and  At least three major reform  JCC reports  Vested interests outside \nactionable plans for  proposals and  of the sector restrict \nTA completion report \nreforming and  restructuring plans  change options. \nmodernizing the  presented to government \nLeadership and \ntransport sector  for approval \nmanagement changes \n  lead to loss of \nknowledge. \nOutputs  By 2016     Risks \n1.
