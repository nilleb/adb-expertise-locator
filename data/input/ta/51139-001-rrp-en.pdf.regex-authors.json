THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nof up to $100,000,000, comprising (i) a loan of up to $65,000,000 to Olam International Limited \n(OIL), (ii) a loan of up to $5,000,000 to Caf\u00e9 Outspan Vietnam Limited (COVL), and (iii) a loan of \nup to $30,000,000 equivalent in United States (US) dollars and rupiah to PT Dharmapala Usaha \nSukses (PT DUS) for the Agricultural Value Chain Development Project in Viet Nam, Indonesia, \nTimor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea (PNG).1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification  \n \n2.  Agriculture key to fight poverty. Agriculture in Asia and the Pacific is characterized by \nunorganized, small-scale farming. Most smallholder farmers are not included in formal value \nchains and face challenges that include lack of access to finance and quality inputs, low yields, \nlack of storage and market infrastructure, limited local value addition, and dependence on brokers. \nAs smallholder farmers make up most of the poor in the region, agricultural development is crucial \nto eradicating poverty and creating conditions for sustainable and equitable growth.  \n \n3.  Persistent rural poverty in Southeast Asia. The agriculture sector in Viet Nam and \nIndonesia has made significant progress, but its smallholder farmers have been left behind. \nViet Nam\u2019s agriculture sector contributes about 20% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 25% \nof exports, and provides employment for 70% of rural households. Yet in Viet Nam\u2019s Central \nHighland Provinces, one of the country\u2019s main agricultural regions where 71% of the population \nare smallholder farmers, the poverty rate is 22%\u2014more than twice the nationwide rate.2 In \nIndonesia, the majority of food crop producers are landless or cultivate small landholdings. These \nfarmers tend to earn low incomes and fall into and out of poverty, contributing to Indonesia\u2019s rural \npoverty rate of 14%, which is significantly higher than the 8% poverty rate of the urban population.  \n \n4.  Widespread rural poverty in the Pacific. In Timor-Leste and PNG, poverty in rural areas \namong smallholder farmers is predominant. In Timor-Leste, 60% of smallholder farmers live below \nthe poverty line.3 In PNG, 91% of people living in rural areas are poor.4 In both countries, most \nfarming households can be characterized as low-input, low-output producers. At the same time, \nagriculture is a dominant sector in both countries. In Timor-Leste, coffee is the country\u2019s largest \nnon-oil export and is grown by 38% of all households.5 In PNG, agriculture accounts for one-third \nof its GDP, with 75% of the population relying on agriculture for its main livelihood. Improvements \nin agricultural production and processing offer one of the clearest pathways for poverty reduction \nand growth of the non-extractive economy in Timor-Leste and PNG.  \n \n5.  Climate change and environmental challenges. Climate change is a serious threat to \ncountries in Asia and the Pacific. The World Bank has listed Viet Nam as one of the five countries \nthat will be worst affected by climate change, given its high exposure to floods and storms.6 \n                                                \n1  In descending order of proportion of total project size (see Table 1), including technical assistance component.  \n2  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  World Bank. 2008.

Timor-Leste Population and Housing Census 2015. Dili.  \n6  World Bank. 2010. Vietnam: Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change. Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \nAdditionally,  the  overuse  of  fertilizers  in  Viet  Nam  is  a  cause  of  water  pollution  and  soil \ndegradation. 7  Indonesia  will  see  temperatures  increase  up  to  3.9  degrees  Celsius  and \nprecipitation decrease up to 12% by 2100 according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange. Timor-Leste and PNG are the two most vulnerable countries to climate change in the \nPacific when measured by economic losses (as a proportion of GDP), with losses from climate \nchange expected to reach 10% of Timor-Leste\u2019s annual GDP and 15% of PNG\u2019s by 2100.8  \n \n6.  Global value chain inclusion. Inclusion of smallholder farmers in formal value chains \ncan help address the challenges of persistent rural poverty, climate change, and environmental \npressure. Formal value chains are typically developed by large corporate buyers who vertically \nintegrate to source directly from the farm gate to secure long-term access to quality products and \nbuild strong relationships with farming communities. Large global agribusinesses in particular can \nlead significant investments in agriculture value chains that benefit smallholder farmers through \nincreased access to new export markets and by linking them with consumers who are willing to \npay a premium for traceability and certification. Agricultural investment has been shown to be one \nof the most effective and least-cost strategies to reduce poverty and hunger.9 Investment in \nagricultural value chains is also one of the least-cost climate change adaptation investments.10  \n \n7.  Government policy alignment. The governments of the four countries included in the \nproject scope prioritize inclusive value chains by linking farmers with global value chains. In \nViet Nam, the Prime Minister approved the agricultural restructuring plan for improving added \nvalue and sustainable development of the sector in 2013.11 Indonesia\u2019s 2015\u20132019 National \nMedium-Term Development Plan highlights the agriculture sector\u2019s role in developing higher \nvalue cropping to improve rural livelihoods.12 Timor-Leste\u2019s Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2030 highlights the need to increase coffee production and develop other cash crop exports.13 \nPNG\u2019s National Agriculture Development Plan, 2007\u20132016 aims to reduce production costs, \nimprove the quality of agricultural produce for domestic and international markets, and increase \nthe income-earning opportunities of those dependent on agriculture.14 \n \n8.  Project selection. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting agriculture \nvalue chain development, with targeted support to governments and local agribusinesses. A wider \nimpact can be achieved across multiple developing member countries (DMCs) by supporting \nagribusinesses that can deploy funds in several countries simultaneously. OIL and its subsidiaries \n(Olam) are well positioned to benefit from economies of scale and can be instrumental in \ndeveloping inclusive and sustainable agricultural value chains with higher local value addition \ngiven their commitment to the highest standards of sustainability and inclusiveness. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n9.  The project will support Olam\u2019s $223 million investment plan in Viet Nam, Indonesia, \nTimor-Leste, and PNG during 2017\u20132019 by financing midstream coffee and sugar processing \n                                                \n7  K.

The project \nalso includes a proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) that will be processed separately. \nThe TA component will provide capacity building training for smallholder farmers. As such, the \nproject will promote inclusive and sustainable agricultural value chains with higher local value \naddition across a variety of products including coffee, sugar, cashew, cocoa, and pepper.  \n \n10.  Higher local value addition. The project will help Olam develop primary and secondary \nprocessing plants in origin markets closer to farmers and in destination markets closer to the \ncustomer, adding more value in local markets and  integrating agricultural value chains.  In \nViet Nam, OIL\u2019s subsidiary COVL has been operating a soluble coffee manufacturing facility since \n2010. [Redacted] The plant sources coffee beans from smallholder farmers in Viet Nam and \nIndonesia, and exports soluble coffee primarily to Japan, the Russian Federation, and Southeast \nAsia. In Indonesia, PT DUS, an OIL subsidiary, operates a sugar refinery in Central Java. \n[Redacted] Raw sugar is typically sourced from Thailand and Australia, and refined sugar is sold \nto food and beverage companies in Indonesia. In Timor-Leste, Olam\u2019s planned investment will \nhelp  upgrade  the  coffee  primary  processing  and  storage  assets  that  Olam  acquired  from \nTimorcorp in 2015. In PNG, Olam plans to expand its coffee operations by expanding primary \nprocessing facilities and storage capacity.  \n \n11.  Inclusive value chains. The project includes permanent working capital investments for \nsmallholder farmer supply in Viet Nam (coffee, cashew, and pepper); Indonesia (coffee and \ncocoa); Timor-Leste (coffee); and PNG (coffee and cocoa). Permanent working capital includes \ninventory of raw agricultural products procured from farmers and advances to farmers, which will \nallow Olam to increase its sourcing volumes from smallholder farmers. The project will augment \nthe direct benefits to smallholder farmers by leveraging existing Olam sustainability programs that \nprovide agricultural extension services, training, and livelihood support to smallholder farmers.15 \nThe proposed transaction TA will complement the project by providing capacity building support \nto about 13,000 smallholder coffee farmers across the project countries. The TA will help \nsmallholder coffee farmers, particularly women, improve productivity and the quality of their crops \nand assist them in obtaining certification.  \n \n12.  Climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable value chains. A key component of \nthe TA will be to provide training in climate-smart agriculture practices including an adaptation \nstrategy for temperature increase and precipitation change, water harvesting and drip irrigation, \nand conservation agriculture. The TA will also focus on training in good agricultural practices such \nas integrated pest management, intercropping,16 and harvest and post-harvest solutions; and \nenvironmentally sustainable agricultural practices such as innovative technologies for resources \nconservation,  use  of  agri-chemicals  and  organic  inputs,  and  pollution  control.  In  addition, \ncollaboration with the Asia-Pacific Climate Finance Fund is being explored to provide weather \ninsurance to smallholder farmers through Olam as an aggregator.  \n \n3.  Borrowers \n \n13.  The borrowers are OIL, a public limited company incorporated in Singapore, and two of \nits subsidiaries: COVL, a soluble coffee plant incorporated in Viet Nam, and PT DUS, a sugar \nrefinery incorporated in Indonesia. OIL is a leading agribusiness company with presence in 70 \n                                                \n15 Olam provides assistance to smallholder farmers through the Olam Livelihood Charter, which assures customers \nthat their product is sustainable, traceable, and helping rural communities. More information on the Olam Livelihood \nCharter is provided under Client Information and Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n16 Growing two or more crops at the same time.  \n ", "4   \ncountries. It differentiates itself by focusing on niche commodities and businesses, buying from \ngrowers and village-level agents at the farm gate, and providing value-added solutions and \nservices to customers (e.g., traceability guarantees). \n \n14.  Temasek  Holdings,  the  Singapore  sovereign  wealth  fund,  became  the  majority \nshareholder of OIL in 2014, owning 52.1%. Mitsubishi Corporation took a 20.0% equity stake in \nOIL in 2015. OIL\u2019s management team has a 6.5% ownership in the company. The 11-member \nboard includes the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, two Mitsubishi nominees, and \nseven independent directors. Integrity and tax integrity due diligence were conducted.17 No \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified.18 \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.  Impact. The project will contribute to at least three targets of the Sustainable Development \nGoals: (i) double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through \ninputs, knowledge, markets,  and  opportunities for  value  addition  and nonfarm  employment \n(Target 2.3); (ii) ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural \npractices that increase productivity and production, help maintain ecosystems, and strengthen \ncapacity for adaptation to climate change (Target 2.4); and (iii) increase significantly the exports \nof developing countries (Target 17.11).19 \n \n16.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome is inclusive and sustainable agricultural value chains \nwith higher local value addition in Viet Nam, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and PNG scaled up.   \n \n17.  Outputs. The outputs are value-added agribusiness operations expanded and training on \nproductive and sustainable farming methods for smallholder farmers provided, in Viet Nam, \nIndonesia, Timor-Leste, and PNG.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with the \nADB Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes the need to invest in agriculture to \nincrease productivity, strengthen links with local value chains, promote food safety and quality \nstandards, and improve the resilience of the sector to the impact of climate change.20 It is  \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies for Viet Nam, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and \nPNG.21 As a regional project benefiting four DMCs as well as non-DMC regional members, the \nproject is aligned with ADB\u2019s operational plan for regional cooperation and integration, which \nhighlights the importance of raising competitiveness in connected markets including through \npromoting and facilitating the participation in global and regional value chains by small and \nmedium-sized enterprises and smallholder farmers.22 \n \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2003.

The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s operational plan for agriculture and natural resources, 2015\u20132020, which recommends \ngreater private sector agribusiness investment by ADB through working with strong agribusiness \nsponsors adopting best practices.23 The project will complement ADB\u2019s sovereign assistance \nprograms in the four targeted DMCs. In Viet Nam, ADB provided sovereign assistance to update \nproductive  rural  infrastructure  to  increase  agricultural  productivity.24 In  Indonesia,  ADB  is \nsupporting the government to improve irrigation services to increase agricultural productivity.25 In \nTimor-Leste, ADB is supporting the government to develop a national coffee sector development \nplan. 26 In PNG, ADB is supporting the rehabilitation of the Highlands Highway, which will \nstrengthen agricultural value chains for domestic and international trade.27  \n \nD.

The project will support inclusive and sustainable agricultural value chains, with higher \nlocal value addition in Asia and the Pacific, and will have a widespread impact on the livelihoods \nof 13,000 smallholder farmers in four DMCs. It will be ADB\u2019s largest nonsovereign exposure to \nthe agriculture sector to date. The project is also ADB\u2019s first direct nonsovereign assistance in \nTimor-Leste, the first nonsovereign agribusiness investment in PNG, and the first local currency \nnonsovereign loan for the agriculture sector in Indonesia. The project is classified an inclusive \nbusiness project.28 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n22.  ADB proposes to provide a loan facility of up to $100 million to OIL and two of its \nsubsidiaries,  COVL  and  PT  DUS,  to  support  Olam\u2019s  $223  million  capital  expenditure  and \npermanent working capital investments (Table 1).29 The facility will include (i) a loan of up to \n$65 million to OIL with a tenor of up to 5 years, including a grace period of up to 3 years; (ii) a \nloan of up to $5 million to COVL with a tenor of up to 7 years, including a grace period of up to \n1 year; and (iii) a loan of up to $30 million equivalent in United States (US) dollars and rupiah to \nPT DUS with a tenor of up to 7 years, including a grace period of up to 1 year. The parallel loan \nof up to $75 million to COVL will likely have a tenor up to 7 years, including a grace period of up \nto 1 year. ADB will benefit from an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee from OIL (the listed \nholding company), which will guarantee the payment obligations of COVL and PT DUS in relation \nto the ADB loans. The rupiah denomination is justified as PT DUS\u2019s production will be for the \nIndonesia domestic market and revenues are collected in rupiah. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  ADB assistance will add value in three areas: \n \n(i)  Diversified funding base. Olam has primarily financed its growth through equity \nand medium-term debt from commercial banks and the bond market. As Olam \ngrows its reach into the upstream and mid- or downstream segments, it needs to \ndiversify its funding base. As an alternative source of long-term financing, ADB can \noffer funding as a development finance institution that understands the agriculture \nsector, and can partner with Olam on a common sustainability agenda targeting \nsmallholder farmers. The parallel cofinancing will diversify Olam\u2019s funding base.   \n(ii)  Sustainability best practices. ADB\u2019s investment will validate and refine Olam\u2019s \nbusiness model, which includes smallholder farmers in the global agriculture value \nchain. Through the TA, ADB will ensure that smallholder farmers improve their \nproductivity, fully benefit from their inclusion in global agricultural value chains, and \n                                                \n28 ADB. 2017.

ADB\u2019s loan facility will be used to support the capital expenditure and \npermanent working capital investments of COVL, PT DUS, and other OIL subsidiaries in Viet Nam, \nIndonesia,  Timor-Leste,  and  PNG.  An  external  third  party  undertook  a  corporate  audit  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009). The corporate audit assessed \nthat the current environmental and social systems, processes, and practices of the companies30 \nare largely in compliance with national statutory requirements and commensurate with the risks \nand impacts associated with their respective businesses and operations. In addition, OIL\u2019s \nfacilities in Viet Nam are certified for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) systems, \nwhile the Indonesian facility plans to apply for the same ISO certifications.31 In compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as category B for environment, \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples.

The due diligence noted that key environmental impacts \nfrom PT DUS and COVL operations include generation of fugitive emissions from coal storage, \nair emissions and noise from boiler operations at sensitive receptors, odor, health risks from poor \nventilation and inadequate occupational management procedures, and fire safety risks.32 PT DUS \nhas undertaken corrective actions to improve its operations and is committed to implementing \nadditional corrective actions from the environmental audit conducted to meet SPS requirements. \nCOVL also aims to improve its process operation. Potential environmental impacts can be \nmitigated  by  following  engineering  international  best  practices  and  implementing  the \nenvironmental management plan included in the initial environmental examination. In compliance \nwith SPS, COVL and PT DUS updated their environmental assessment reports to meet SPS \nrequirements on the initial environmental examination.

Both facilities are committed to meet environmental best practices. \n \n34.  Social safeguards. The facilities of COVL, PT DUS, and OIL\u2019s subsidiary in PNG are \nlocated in industrial parks, and the facilities of OIL\u2019s subsidiary in Timor-Leste are located on \nleased  lands.  The  expansion  facilities  will  be  constructed  within  existing  premises  of  the \nsubsidiary companies. These lands do not have any legacy or current risks associated with land \nacquisition or resettlement. The independent audit assessed that operations of OIL subsidiaries \ndo not result in impacts on indigenous people. No involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples \nissues are envisaged for the project on account of its operational and expansion plans.  \n \n35.  Corrective action plan. The corporate and subproject audits recommended measures \nand actions to ensure alignment and compliance with SPS and other social requirements. These \nare documented and agreed in a corrective action plan for the project. As part of the corrective \naction  plan,  OIL,  COVL,  PT  DUS,  Timor-Leste,  and  PNG  facilities  will  strengthen  their \nenvironmental  and  social  systems  and  processes  satisfactory  to  ADB  before  ADB\u2019s  first \ndisbursement.
