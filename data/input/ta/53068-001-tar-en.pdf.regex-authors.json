INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will help developing member \ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) deliver their commitments to reduce \nmarine plastic pollution from \u201csource to sea.\u201d1 The TA cluster will help (i) prepare action plans; (ii) \nreform policy and regulations to encourage a circular economy; and (iii) prepare investments in \nintegrated solid waste management (ISWM) and circular economy systems.2 The TA cluster will \nalso promote and facilitate regional cooperation and knowledge sharing. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the management-approved 2019 results-based work plan of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC).3 It is aligned with Strategy \n2030 operational priorities on environmental sustainability, livable cities, and regional public \ngoods.4 The TA cluster supports the ADB Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue \nEconomies and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDGS 11, 12, and 14.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Marine plastic pollution is an enormous and growing problem. About 150 million tons of \nplastic is already in the ocean, and this amount increases every year by about 8 million to 12 \nmillion tons.6 Eight of the 10 rivers that transport 88%\u201395% of the global load of plastics into the \nsea are in Asia: the Yangtze, Yellow, Hai, Pearl, Amur, Mekong, Indus, and Ganges rivers.7 \nFurther, of the top 12 source countries ranked by the proportion of mismanaged plastic waste \nwithin the coastal zone, nine are ADB DMCs (by ranking): the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nIndonesia, the Philippines, Viet Nam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India.8 \n \n4.  Marine plastics cause an estimated 1%\u20135% decline in benefits or services from oceans\u2014\nequating  to  $0.5  trillion  to  $2.5  trillion  per  year\u2014particularly  those  relating  to  fisheries, \naquaculture, recreation, natural heritage, and human well-being.9 Hundreds of marine species \nsuffer from entanglement and ingestion of plastic, and a quarter of all fish caught now contain \nmicroplastic in their guts.10 About 11 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs across Asia \nand the Pacific and are projected to increase coral reef disease outbreaks.11 The long-term impact \nof microplastic on human health remains unknown, but exposure is clear: microplastic particles \nhave  been  identified  in  human  stool  samples  across  the  world.  Poorer  communities  are \n                                                \n1  \u201cSource to sea\u201d is an inclusive and integrated governance approach that looks at the whole system starting at the \nsource, e.g., upstream in the environment (rivers, catchments) and also in the production or consumption cycle. \n2  Circular economy aims to gradually decouple economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, design \nwaste and pollution out of the system, and keep products and materials in use for longer. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 June 2019. The concept paper \nwas processed as regular TA, which was later converted to cluster TA. \n4  ADB. 2018.

Illegal recycling factories burn massive volumes of unrecyclable plastic, causing air \npollution and public health concerns because plastic fumes are carcinogenic. Plastic waste also \nblocks waterways and sewers, exacerbating flooding and creating breeding grounds for pests that \ntransmit vector-borne diseases. Finally, plastic has significant carbon impact: if growth continues \nas projected, plastic will account for 20% of total oil consumption by 2050 (footnote 6). \n \n5.  Marine plastic pollution is a complex multisector problem, but one largely resulting from (i) \nunsustainable  production  and  consumption  patterns,  as  development,  urbanization,  and \nconsumerism have led to a surge in the generation of disposable and nondegradable products \nand packaging; and (ii) poor or insufficient ISWM systems and infrastructure. Globally, plastic \nproduction has surged from 15 million tons in 1964 to 311 million tons in 2014 and is expected to \ndouble over the next 20 years. In 2015, plastic packaging waste, mostly single-use material \ndesigned for immediate disposal, accounted for 47% of the plastic waste generated globally.12 \nSuch low-residual-value plastic is not collected by waste pickers because it cannot be resold, and \nso is more likely to leak into the ocean; the most common items found during coastal cleanups \nare plastic bottles, caps, food wrappers, grocery bags, lids, and straws.13 Addressing this problem \nrequires a fundamental shift in production and consumption from a traditional take, make, and \ndispose approach to a circular economy that includes widespread public behavior change, \nincreased private sector responsibility, new business models, and innovations in packaging and \ntechnologies to promote recovery, remanufacturing, and recycling. \n \n6.  ISWM  is  one  of  the  most  neglected  and  underinvested  municipal  services  across \ndeveloping Asia, and reduce, reuse, and recycle approaches to address plastic waste directly are \nespecially limited. About 75% of land-sourced ocean plastic comes from uncollected waste or \nlitter, while the rest comes from gaps in the collection system itself (footnote 12). Large amounts \nof waste are abandoned in public places, often into or near rivers. Even in the collection system, \nleakage occurs through illegal dumping and through formal and informal dump sites that are \nlocated on rivers or coasts or lack proper controls. ISWM is expensive and prioritized below other \ncompeting development needs. Further, designing financially sustainable and forward-looking \nsystems for a circular economy, while maximizing coverage and minimizing impacts, is complex. \nCapacity for planning, management, monitoring, and enforcement is limited: boosting investment \nin ISWM requires institutional strengthening; regulatory reform, infrastructure and technologies; \nand sustainable financing mechanisms. \n \n7.  Global efforts to address marine plastic pollution have been gaining momentum, and the \nregion has seen increasing calls for action in recent years, including the Statement on Combating \nMarine Plastic Debris by the East Asian Summit Leaders in 2018 and the Bangkok Declaration \non Combating Marine Debris in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Region in \n2019.14 These are supported by the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris and the \nRegional Action Plan on Marine Litter in 2019, and the Pacific Regional Action Plan: Marine Litter \n                                                \n12 Ocean Conservancy and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. 2015.

These plans set ambitious goals and broad actions, which now need to \nbe implemented across the government, civil society, and the private sector, with interventions in \ncoastal areas, along key rivers, and along sector supply chains; they necessitate a source to sea \napproach that plans integrated and inclusive action and prioritizes investment. \n \n8.  Marine plastic is a transboundary pollutant, flowing beyond national boundaries into \nregional and international waters, and therefore warrants regional action. In line with the regional \nefforts (para. 7), all DMCs consulted during TA preparation\u2014Indonesia, Myanmar, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, the PRC, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014support an approach to the TA that facilitates \nknowledge sharing, partnerships, and cooperation on plastic pollution to improve ocean health as \na regional public good. The TA will work closely with partners to effectively support DMCs, \nincluding the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Global Plastic Action Partnership, the Stockholm \nInternational Waters Institute, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the \nEuropean Investment Bank, the World Bank, the Government of Japan, and the Government of \nthe Republic of Korea. The TA will also engage private companies and public\u2013private alliances. \nCollaboration with the Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia, United Nations Environment \nProgramme, and the ASEAN will aid coordination. \n \n9.  ADB has a growing pipeline of ISWM projects that it can enhance and expand to help \nreduce marine plastic pollution. This TA will build on the lessons and recommendations of the TA \nprojects Mainstreaming Integrated Solid Waste Management in Asia, and other TA projects on \nsupporting environment-related SDGs and use of market-based approaches for environmental \nmanagement  (including  waste  management).16  The  TA  team  will  also  work  with  ADB\u2019s \nsubregional programs to mainstream and scale up solutions. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n10.  The strategically linked subprojects share the goal of helping DMCs to reduce marine \nplastic pollution and to implement ADB\u2019s Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue \nEconomies. The TA cluster modality allows the flexibility to expand the scope under current \noutputs (e.g., to provide targeted support to other subregions in addition to Southeast Asia); and \nto integrate any future priorities identified from the initial subprojects.  \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impacts: marine plastic pollution reduced; and \nhealth of rivers, coasts, and marine ecosystems restored.17 The TA will have the following \noutcome: DMC action to address marine plastic pollution enhanced.18 \n                                                \n15 ASEAN. 2019.

The marine plastic pollution problem requires an immediate and significant expansion in \neffective ISWM, including reduce, reuse, and recycle, and a more fundamental shift toward a \ncircular economy. These changes require planning and policy reform; investment in infrastructure, \ntechnologies, and systems; and strong partnerships, knowledge, and financing. The TA focuses \ninitially on Southeast Asia, targeting DMCs for support based on potential impact and demand. \nParticipating countries will include Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.19 Support for \npreparing investment and participating in regional activities will be open to other DMCs, while \nregional research will cover the whole region and provide differentiated recommendations where \nappropriate.20 The TA will have the following key outputs. \n \n13.  Output 1: Action plans and policies to address marine plastic pollution supported. \nThe TA will help develop government-led action plans to reduce plastic pollution at national, \nprovincial, and city levels by filling information gaps, preparing critical inputs, and supporting \nintegrated and multi-stakeholder source-to-sea planning processes. Support will be based on \nDMC demand, in collaboration with partner agencies and in coordination with ADB programs, \nsuch as Livable Cities and subregional cooperation programs. The action plans will be based on \nanalyses of waste characteristics and volumes; ISWM systems and infrastructure; plastic waste \nhot spots and leakage points (i.e., within the ISWM system, and priority sectors and supply \nchains); policy and regulatory frameworks; institutional capacity; and community and business \nbehaviors, drivers, and triggers. The action plans will identify and prioritize actions across \ninstitutional  and  financing  arrangements,  policy  and  regulation,  sustainable  production  and \nconsumption, behavior change, and infrastructure and technology investments. The TA will \nincorporate capacity building throughout to enable informed decision-making and ownership of \naction plans and policies by government departments and stakeholders. The TA will provide \nfurther support to implement priority actions on a case-by-case basis, possibly including support \nfor policy and regulatory reform where DMCs are committed to drive this forward. Policy and \nregulatory measures supported through the project will be based on robust policy analyses and \nregulatory impact assessments. Possible instruments may include bans, taxes, levies, subsidies, \nproduct  takebacks,  deposit-refund  schemes,  material  product  stands,  green  supply  chains, \nminimum recycled content requirements, and extended producer responsibility schemes.21 \n \n14.  Output 2: Plastic pollution reduction investments supported. The TA will provide on-\ndemand specialist support to operations departments to help identify, prepare, and boost the \nimplementation of government and private sector action to reduce marine plastic pollution.22 The \nscope of specialist inputs and services will cover ISWM and circular economy, with inputs for \nupstream work through project implementation. Such inputs could include (i) undertaking sector \nassessments as part of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and country operations business plan \nprocesses; (ii) supporting project teams in investment dialogues with DMCs and partners; (iii) \nexploring problems and solutions, providing technical inputs to inform concept designs, and \n                                                \n19 This will be confirmed based on consultations with Operations Departments and subject to receipt of no-objection \nletters from participating DMCs.  \n20 Work on this TA will be coordinated with the TA to the PRC for Capacity Building on River and Ocean Eco-\nEnvironmental Management and Plastic Waste Pollution Control (ADB. China, People\u2019s Republic of: Capacity \nBuilding on River and Ocean Eco-Environmental Management and Plastic Waste Pollution Control) and other TA \nand loan projects supporting the reduction of marine plastic pollution. \n21 Extended producer responsibility is a policy approach where producers are given significant financial and/or physical \nresponsibilities to treat and dispose of postconsumer goods. \n22 This may include policy-based lending for new or reformed standards or regulations on plastics; urban planning and \ninfrastructure investments that facilitate efficient material flows, and waste minimization and management; zero waste \ncities and ecovillages; sustainable and smart value chain development that considers effective waste management; \nand private sector investments that result in reduced plastic waste. \n ", "5 \nhelping prepare concept papers; (iv) providing specialist advice and inputs to improve project \ndesign or implementation; and (v) providing technical inputs and supporting project teams to \nmobilize finance. The TA will also support small-scale demonstration projects on ISWM, plastic \ncircular economy, and innovative solutions and technologies to reduce marine plastic pollution. \nFor example, the tentative concept for one demonstration will target 2,000\u20134,000 households and \ncomprise household separation of wet and dry waste, business and community behavior change \ncampaigns, partnerships with microenterprises and a reprocessing company to support the new \nwaste system, pilot tests of innovative digital technologies, and support for particularly vulnerable \ncommunity groups to develop livelihood and micro business opportunities. Demonstration sites \nwill be confirmed during TA inception following field visits, consultations, and evaluation against \nkey criteria. The TA will carry out innovation challenges to promote and support innovation and \nemerging technologies for ocean health and circular economy, especially from Asia and the \nPacific, including under ADB\u2019s Digital Innovation Sandbox Program.23 If appropriate, the TA may \nsupport challenge winners to pilot their proposals at ADB project sites. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Knowledge,  regional  cooperation,  and  financing  for  marine  plastic \npollution  solutions  improved.  Output  3  focuses  on  supporting  subregional  and  regional \nactivities, including priority actions in regional plans. The TA will undertake research studies \nspecific to the developing Asia and the Pacific context to fill critical knowledge gaps, including on \n(i) environmental and socioeconomic costs; (ii) infrastructure, technology, and investment needs \nto address marine plastic pollution through ISWM and a transition to a circular economy; and (iii) \ninstruments (e.g., policy, regulation, social, or market-based) to reduce marine plastic pollution \nand promote a circular economy. Knowledge sharing, cross learning, and capacity building \nactivities targeting mid- to senior-level government officials, as well as private sector and civil \nsociety representatives where appropriate, will communicate the findings and topics of outputs 1\u2013\n2 and research under output 3, and include source-to-sea action planning, instruments to promote \nand implement plastic circular economy, private sector engagement and sustainable financing, \nand innovation and technology solutions (both low-tech and high-tech) to address marine plastic \npollution  and  other  ocean  health  issues.  Further,  the  TA  will  support  cooperation  among \ndeveloping countries, for example between  ASEAN and the PRC or between Indonesia and \nPacific island countries.24 The TA will carry out awareness-raising and mainstreaming activities \non ocean health and circular economy through subregional cooperation programs, such as the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  Bay  of  Bengal  Large  Marine \nEcosystem Project, and Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle. Activities through these \nprograms will target leaders, ministers, and mid- to senior-level officials. The TA will help develop \nADB\u2019s Oceans Financing Initiative by developing financing mechanisms and mobilizing resources \nand/or funding for healthy oceans. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $5,700,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources); (ii) $700,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund;25 (iii) \n$1,500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and \nadministered by ADB; (iv) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-\n                                                \n23 ADB Digital Innovation Sandbox Program. \n24 This is based on the letter of intent between ADB and Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of National Development Planning on \ncollaboration in areas of mutual interest, including marine plastic debris, signed on 2 May 2019. Such cooperation \nactivities will be coordinated with ADB operations departments. \n25 Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n \n ", "6 \nAsia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB; and (v) $2,000,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Global Environment Facility and administered by ADB.26 Detailed \ncost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each TA subproject proposal \nsubmitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. The SDCC\u2019s Environment Thematic Group will lead \nthe implementation of the subprojects and will closely coordinate target DMCs, activities, and \nconsultant outputs under each subproject with operations departments, sector and thematic \ngroups, and other organizations working on the TA themes. The thematic group will select, \nadminister, and evaluate the consultants. The director general of the SDCC will submit each TA \nsubproject proposal for approval; subproject activities will start only after project approval. The \nEnvironment  Thematic  group  will  develop  a  partnerships  strategy  and  a  knowledge, \ncommunications, and events plan for the TA to help coordinate and maximize the impact of these \ncomponents. The TA team will work with several development partners, including the World Wide \nFund for Nature and the United Nations Environment Programme, to implement the TA activities. \nThe TA will use US EPA as a resource and a peer reviewer of relevant TA outputs.27 \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  December 2019\u2013July 2023 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  ADB, Environment Thematic Group \nConsultantsa  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by \nAction planning and pilot projects  Firm: FBS  ADB \nPlastic circular economy  Firm: FBS  ADB \ninstruments: research, policy \nreform, and project support \nInvestment needs research  Firm: FBS  ADB \nISWM specialist  Individual selection  ADB \nKnowledge, communications, and  Individual selection  ADB \nevents specialist \nOcean health partnerships  Individual selection  ADB \nspecialist \nTA administrator (national)  Individual selection  ADB \nKnowledge, communications, and  Individual selection  ADB \nevents coordinator (national) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FBS = fixed budget selection, ISWM = integrated solid waste management, TA = \ntechnical assistance. \na  The outline terms of reference for consultants will be included in the subprojects. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.
