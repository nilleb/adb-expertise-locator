INTRODUCTION \n1.  Two lessons emerging from the global financial crisis are the importance of adequate \nfinancial systems to help limit the probability of banking crises and the need to more effectively \nlimit the negative impacts of crises on financial systems when they do occur. Explicit deposit \ninsurance is important to help establish an adequate financial safety net, reduce runs on banks, \nlimit government fiscal and political exposure, and create a formal mechanism for transferring \ncosts of bank failures to industry rather than taxpayers1, shoring up the financial system in times \nof  crisis.  The  central banks  of the  People\u2019s Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  Mongolia  have \nrequested assistance to develop and physically establish explicit deposit insurance systems \n(DISs). In both countries, the current explicit (in Mongolia\u2019s case) or implicit (in the PRC\u2019s case) \ngovernment guarantees on deposits create significant levels of contingent government liabilities \nand uncertainty. Conversion to an explicit, separately funded deposit insurance scheme will \nboth limit government liabilities and reduce moral hazard. Fact-finding missions visited Mongolia \nduring 14\u201317 February 2009 and Beijing during 1\u20133 April 2009 to determine the objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements for regional policy and advisory technical assistance \n(R-PATA).2 The technical assistance (TA) design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Explicit deposit insurance is a key element in maintaining confidence in the banking \nsystem and promoting financial stability. 3 The purpose of deposit insurance varies from one \ncountry to another, depending on the legal framework and financial infrastructure that exist, but \nin most cases deposit insurance schemes are designed to protect less financially sophisticated \ndepositors and contribute to financial stability. As deposit insurance helps protect small savers \nand the poor from losing their savings due to failure of the insured financial institutions, these \npeople attain greater asset security and lower risk. While most deposit insurance schemes are \nestablished and run by some combination of national governments and central banks, others \nare private. Some countries have different schemes to protect different types of banks, and \nsome deposit insurance arrangements have multiple-country participants. Some countries have \ndeposit insurance for nonbank deposit-taking institutions as well as for banks. \n \n3.  Since the first deposit insurance corporation began in the United States in 1933, various \ncountries worldwide have established DISs. The number of countries that had established, are \nestablishing, or are considering establishing DISs has expanded rapidly in recent years. As of \n2008, 103 countries had instituted some form of explicit deposit insurance (up from 12 in 1974).4 \nAnother 16 countries are studying or considering explicit DISs, including Mongolia and the PRC. \nIn establishing a DIS, each country must consider what it hopes to achieve and whether the \nscheme will be internally consistent with its goals. Circumstances unique to the country will bear \nsignificantly on what a system can achieve and how it should be structured. Three main types of \nDIS have emerged: (i) a \u201cpay box\u201d system has a narrow mandate of collecting and investing \npremiums purely for insurance purposes; (ii) a middle way approach insures deposits, while the \ndeposit insurer may take regulatory action if there are concerns about the bank regulator\u2019s \nactions when bank soundness is weakened or compromised; and (iii) a broad mandate has both \na deposit insurance and regulatory role and permits closing of troubled banks. \n                                                 \n1  Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation. 2009.

Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, Kane and Laeven assembled a cross-country and time-series database \ncovering 181 countries to review the evolution of DISs and the different features that have \ndeveloped.5 This database has provided comprehensive information on the circumstances that \nhave encouraged adoption of deposit insurance schemes, the design features installed in these \nschemes, and changes in these features that had been made over time. Based on their findings, \nthe authors provided six principles for developing and establishing a DIS. First, it is important to \nset enforceable coverage limits and to stay focused on managing risk for those who cannot \neasily interpret bank credit and intermediation processes. By contrast, it must be clear to large \ndepositors, subordinated debt holders, and correspondent banks that their funds are at risk and \nare not guaranteed. This motivates them to assess and manage their own risks of loss. \n \n5.  Second, the most effective DIS has compulsory membership. Third, a better DIS has a \nblend of public and private management, with both being jointly responsible for oversight. Fourth, \na strong DIS has a limited ability to shift losses and exposure to the government and taxpayers. \nIf this is not the case, as evidenced by the experience of the UK with its system of shifting part \nof the insurance costs to depositors, runs on banks can still occur. Fifth, pricing is a key issue \nand should be carefully assessed. Finally, deposit insurers must have some power to get \ninvolved\u2014and in fact involve themselves\u2014in decisions about how and when insolvent banks \nwill be addressed. This finding argues against the \u201cpay box\u201d system and for a more intrusive DIS.      \n \n6.  The current global financial crisis is characterized by liquidity problems and a crisis of \nconfidence  in  banking  institutions  around  the  world.  Many  of  the  steps  recently  taken  by \ngovernments to help restore confidence in the banking system involve actions associated with \ndeposit insurance. Examples of specific reforms initiated or under consideration include two \ncountries implementing deposit insurance (Australia and New Zealand); mechanisms to pay \ndepositors promptly when banks fail and to have public awareness and consultation systems \n(UK and EU); increases in deposit insurance coverage (many countries, including the US, EU, \nand  the  Philippines);  government  blanket  deposit  insurance  (many  countries,  including \nMongolia); and enhancements to the risk-based premium systems for deposit insurance (US). \n \n7.  Recent work focusing on lessons from the global financial crisis for financial safety nets, \nand in particular for deposit insurance schemes, narrows the options and creates opportunities \nfor better structuring of explicit deposit schemes.6 Specific lessons for developing countries \ninclude the importance of an explicit DIS, need for government intervention during a systemic \ncrisis,  the  ineffectiveness  of  co-insurance,  the  need  for  effective  public  awareness  and \nstrengthening  of  regulatory  and  supervisory  apparatuses  as  well  as  close  interagency \ncooperation, and sound corporate governance in insured financial institutions. \n \n8.  Today\u2019s unique global financial circumstances dictate that countries without DISs may \nbenefit from expedited engagement, and there is both financial and political pressure to take this \nstep. In the case of the PRC, deposit insurance legislation has been under consideration and \nwas submitted to the State Council in the latter part of 2008. However, precise mechanisms for \nthe physical establishment and financing of the DIS have yet to be formalized. In Mongolia\u2019s \ncase, the country will need to arrange for transition from the current blanket government deposit \n                                                 \n5  A.

The level of PRC participation in the Mongolian economy \nsuggests  that  a  parallel  development  of  deposit  insurance  may  benefit  both  countries  by \nincreasing the security of Mongolia-based investments and improving the safety for regional \nbanks on either side of the border. The focus of this R-PATA is on developing a holistic \nroadmap consisting of (i) a complete transition plan from the current circumstances to a DIS, \ninclusive of establishing an appropriate regulatory framework, installing institutional structures, \nand  providing  financing;  (ii)  a  capacity  building  plan  for  managers  and  staff;  (iii)  a  public \ninformation  program  to  facilitate  transition  with  social  harmony  and  confidence;  and  (iv)  a \ntimeline for a suitable DIS to be implemented.  \n \n9.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has undertaken a number of activities associated \nwith deposit insurance, particularly during and just after the 1990s Asian financial crisis. Most of \nits DIS work has concentrated on capacity building for existing schemes and applied research. \nIn 1997, assistance to the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation was provided under a TA \nproject.7 In 1999, a small-scale TA project examined issues for the establishment of deposit \ninsurance in Indonesia. In 2000, as part of substantial research all across Asia, ADB published \na series8 with included an article by J. Choi entitled Structuring a Deposit Insurance System \nfrom the Asian Perspective. Choi provides a good history of deposit insurance in Asia; identifies \nthe risks inherent in implicit deposit guarantees; defines the appropriate status and functions of \nan  Asian  deposit  insurance  scheme;  provides  information  on  operations,  financing,  and \nstructure of existing DISs in India, Republic of Korea, and the Philippines at that time; and lays \nout information on desirable management structures. In 2003, as part of program assistance, \nwork to enhance the deposit insurance agency in Viet Nam was undertaken;9 and follow-up \nactivities are under way now. Lessons learned from this work include (i) the need for practical, \naction-oriented outputs; (ii) the importance of strong commitment from the central banks and \nDIS  officials  for  the  processes  agreed;  (iii)  prudent  selection  of  consultants  with  proven \nknowledge and experience, and (iv) active interaction among ADB, the consultant team, and the \nrelevant government officials. These lessons have been built into the R-PATA structure. \n \n10.  The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) is a technical, membership-\nbased nonprofit institution focused on deposit insurance schemes worldwide and based at the \nBank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. In June 2009, it produced, and the \nBank of International Settlements endorsed, the Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance \nSystems (IADI Core Principles), which consist of 21 principles in 11 categories that cover the \nrange  of  organizational  and  operational  features  of  an  effective  DIS.  Along  with  the  Core \nPrinciples, IADI has provided a list of prerequisites for the installation of an effective DIS. These \nmaterials will form the basis of DIS development under the proposed TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of this R-PATA will be improved confidence in, and stability of, the financial \nsectors in Mongolia and the PRC, as measured by the full operation of a DIS in each country by \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997.

The R-PATA\u2019s outcome will be the introduction of deposit insurance systems that are \nconsistent with the IADI Core Principles by end-2012 in Mongolia and the PRC. \n  \n12.  The proposed R-PATA will provide support to the central banks of Mongolia and the \nPRC to develop and help establish national deposit insurance institutions which (i) conform with \nthe IADI Core Principles10 and the specific conditions of each country\u2019s financial market; (ii) suit \nthe current unique global financial market circumstances; (iii) minimize moral hazard; and (iv) \nprovide extensive public information campaigns as to the purpose and functions of deposit \ninsurance, particularly for households that are poor, income-insecure, or have low financial \nsophistication.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  process  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  specific  guidance  on  deposit \ninsurance development issued by the Financial Stability Forum in 2001, appropriately modified \ngiven the global financial crisis.11 The R-PATA will be undertaken as pure advisory and policy \nsupport  provided  by  (i)  engaging  the  services  of  appropriate  international  and  domestic \nconsultants; (ii) fostering potential partnerships between the People\u2019s Bank of China and Bank \nof Mongolia and experienced, suitable DIS organizations in other countries; and (iii) conducting \nshort-term visits and/or secondments of People\u2019s Bank of China and Bank of Mongolia officials \nto suitable DIS organizations. IADI has agreed in principle12 to support consultations of this \nnature and to recommend potential consultant candidates for ADB consideration.  \n \n14.  The  R-PATA\u2019s  first  output  will  be  a  situational  analysis,  including  the  state  of  the \neconomy, current monetary and fiscal policies, state and structure of the banking system, public \nattitudes and expectations, strength of prudential regulation and supervision, legal framework, \nand  soundness  of  the  accounting  and  disclosure  regimes.13 Each  country\u2019s  public  policy \nobjectives regarding the conversion process and explicit deposit insurance scheme will also be \ndetermined. The assessment will fully consider the IADI Core Principles, and it will provide \nspecific  recommendations  for  legal  and  regulatory  revisions  as  needed.  Consultants  and \nseconded technical staff will undertake the review with the full partnership and support of the \nMongolia and PRC central bank teams and other government officials as appropriate. Any \nprerequisites needed to ensure readiness for the operational establishment of DIS (including the \ntiming of the initiatives) will be listed and discussed with key stakeholders to determine how \nrealistic these are. An analytical policy note with results of the situational analysis, a list of \nvalidated public policy objectives, and necessary prerequisites will be provided to improve each \ncountry\u2019s readiness for deposit insurance. The information will be disseminated via seminars \ninvolving key stakeholders.  \n \n15.  The second output will be a guidelines document for DIS discussions, tailored to the \nspecific circumstances of each country. The guidelines document\u2019s key elements will be in five \nsections. The first section will discuss the mandates, power, and structure of each DIS. It will \ninclude a formal government statement of purpose for the DIS and its planned role within the \nfinancial safety net; arrangements for the DIS either within an existing entity or as a separate \n                                                 \n10 http://www.iadi.org/docs/Core_Principles_final_29_Feb_08.pdf \n11 Financial Stability Forum. 2001.

The \nsecond section will include the relationships among financial safety net agencies, the roles and \nresponsibilities of each agency, and coordination and information-sharing commitments. The \nthird section will include such specific design features as membership (banks, nonbank financial \ninstitutions,  state-owned  institutions,  foreign  banks;  and  whether  or  not  membership  is \nmandatory) and coverage limits (including whether foreign currency deposits will be covered). \nThe fourth section will propose funding arrangements, including consideration of ex-ante or ex-\npost financing, size of the fund, and premium arrangements (size, flat rate or risk-adjusted). The \nlast section will be a design for a detailed public awareness campaign. This detailed document \nwill be discussed broadly with stakeholders on a confidential basis, and agreements will be \nreached about the principles contained. Based on the detailed document, a policy note with \nnonconfidential information will be prepared and disseminated in each country. \n \n16.  The next output will be a draft detailed implementation plan for a DIS in each country, \ninclusive  of  comprehensive  elements  of  an  institutional  structure,  financing  arrangements, \nactivities that include a public information campaign, and timeline. In discussions with Mongolia \nand the PRC, the most appropriate mechanisms for setting up a DIS will be defined, inclusive of \nstaff skills and costs, timing, and problems experienced by other similar countries in setting up \nand operating DISs. Another round of consultations on the detailed implementation plan will \ntake place with key stakeholders, and particularly with the regulatory agencies that form the \nfinancial safety net in each country. \n \n17.  The  final  output  will  be  confirmation  of  final  arrangements  for  the  DIS  detailed \nimplementation plan in each country, based on discussions with key government stakeholders \nwithin and between countries. The draft detailed implementation plans will be discussed with \nkey stakeholders (the central banks, ministries of finance, other financial sector regulators, \nbanks, and other participating institutions) to determine the required timelines, resources, and \nactions for establishment of the DISs. The implementation plans will then be finalized, packaged \nwith the situational analysis and guidelines document, and then submitted to relevant decision \nmakers for approval and funding. The implementation plans will include methods for broadly \ndisseminating information to the public about deposit insurance and its meaning to households. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.   The TA is estimated to cost $500,000. This amount will be financed with a grant from \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund. The TA will \ncover  remuneration,  travel,  and  per  diem  of  consultants,  as  well  as  training,  workshops, \npublications, and miscellaneous expenses. Resources to fund transport, accommodation, and \nper diem for up to 9 person-months of qualified pro bono advisors seconded from suitable \nnational DISs have been provided for in the budget. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "6     \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The TA will commence about 1 September 2009 and be completed on 31 August 2011, \na span of 24 months. It will be executed by ADB and managed by the East Asia Department\u2019s \nFinancial Sector, Public Management and Regional Cooperation Division. The project officer will \nwork  closely  with  the  Banking  Supervision  Department  at  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  and  the \nFinancial Stability Bureau at the People\u2019s Bank of China, these entities being the designated \nagencies to design and establish the DIS in each country. Both BOM and PBOC have confirmed \ntheir willingness to participate in the proposed R-PATA.  ADB will work with IADI to seek pro \nbono advisors from suitable national deposit insurance organizations to conduct the required \ntraining and refine the detailed implementation plan, as feasible and appropriate. The proceeds \nof the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2008, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  The consultants will consist of two international (8 person-months) and four national \nexperts (two each for PRC and Mongolia, for a total of 12 person-months) in legal issues, \nfinancing arrangements, and human resources management in relation to deposit insurance. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB as individual consultants in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national consultants. Consultant terms \nof reference are in Appendix 3. Costs for training, seminars, and conference costs will be \nincluded in the Team Leader\u2019s contract. \n \n \nIV.
