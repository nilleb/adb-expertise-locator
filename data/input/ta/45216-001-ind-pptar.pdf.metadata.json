The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is needed to undertake sector \npreparatory work and define the scope of the ensuing project.   \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The PPTA has been structured in two phases. Phase 1 has been specifically conceived \nto (i) conduct economic and sector analyses, road map and policy framework preparation for \ncluster development in Bangalore Metropolitan Region, and (ii) prepare prefeasibility studies for \npriority clusters (6-8) for assistance and an investment program.1 Phase 2 will conduct detailed \nfeasibility studies for two clusters to be financed under Tranche 1, structure investments for \npublic  and  public-private  partnership  financing,  prepare  multitranche  financing  facility \nframeworks (safeguards and otherwise) and prepare a package for financing by ADB (public \nand/or private sectors) and other cofinanciers (which may include syndication from private \nsector and/or joint or parallel financing from other international financing institutions and/or \ndevelopment partners).

To stimulate Bangalore\u2019s growth potential, the PPTA proposes to blend a multisectoral \ncomprehensive  and  tested  analytical framework for  competitiveness  and  the  application of \ndemand driven approaches that build on partnerships between the private sector and local \ngovernment. To promote multi-stakeholder ownership, the PPTA proposes to apply a highly \nparticipatory approach from planning to design stages. This is expected to lead to stronger \npublic-private partnerships, generate investors\u2019 confidence, and in parallel leverage, private \nsector  financing.  In  addition,  the  PPTA  seeks  to  generate  endogenous  and  exogenous \nknowledge and proposes to share through publications and workshops. \n                                                \n1  Based on a detailed needs and gap assessment, Tranche 1 interventions will be presented in a matrix indicating \nopportunities for Project financing by (a) public sector, (b) private sector, and/or (c) PPP financing. \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n \nC.
