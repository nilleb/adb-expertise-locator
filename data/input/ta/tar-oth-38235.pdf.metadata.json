The  2nd  Ministerial  Conference  on  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC), which was held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in November 2003, called on multilateral \ninstitutions (MIs) to support regional economic cooperation through project investment and \nfurther analytical work. The participants of the conference stressed the need for analytical work \nthat  would  display  costs  and  benefits  of  increased  economic  cooperation  and  help  build \nconstituencies for regional economic cooperation. \n \n2.  In early 2004, the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) decided to prepare a \nsecond Central Asia regional human development report, which would seek to demonstrate the \nimportance of regional cooperation for human development and security in the region. At a \nworkshop organized by UNDP in Tashkent in March 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nagreed, in principle, to contribute to this report. Subsequently, it was agreed that ADB would \nconduct a study on Central Asia regional cooperation in trade, transport, and transit\u2014three \nrelated areas of operational importance to ADB. Findings of the study will be used to provide \ninputs to the UNDP report and to prepare a companion ADB report on Central Asia regional \ncooperation in trade, transport, and transit. While the UNDP report will focus on the five Central \nAsian republics (CARs)\u2014namely, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan\u2014the  ADB  study  would  cover  the  countries  that  are  member  of  its  CAREC \nprogram\u2014that is, Azerbaijan, People's Republic of China (PRC), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nMongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n \n3.  Regional technical assistance (TA) was proposed to undertake the study.1 The main \nfeatures of the TA were agreed on with the governments of the CAREC member countries, \nincluding when a joint ADB-UNDP Mission visited Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan in June\u2013July 2004. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  It  is  widely  recognized  that  the  CARs  will  greatly  benefit  from  increased  economic \ncooperation with each other and neighboring countries. Most notably, greater regional economic \ncooperation will enable them to use and adapt the highly integrated physical infrastructure they \ninherited from the former Soviet Union and the region's shared ecosystems more efficiently, \novercome the disadvantages of their landlocked location and relatively small domestic markets, \ngain greater access to markets in neighboring countries, attract more foreign investment, and \ntackle  regional  environmental  problems  more  effectively.  Ultimately,  increased  regional \neconomic cooperation can contribute to greater competitiveness, sustainable economic growth, \nemployment generation, and poverty reduction in the CARs and will also enhance security and \nstability in the region. \n \n5.  Not surprisingly, there have been numerous initiatives aiming to promote economic \ncooperation among CARs and between CARs and neighboring countries. Among them are \nADB's  CAREC  program,  Central  Asia  Cooperation  Organization,  Economic  Cooperation \nOrganization, Euroasia Economic Community, and Special Programme for the Economies of \nCentral Asia. Several other initiatives seek to foster cooperation among CARs and neighboring \ncountries not only in economics, but also in politics, security, and other spheres.2\n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 June 2004. \n2  For a complete list of the regional organizations involving the CARs, their membership, and objectives, see ADB. \n2003. An Assessment of Regional Organizations in Central Asia. Manila. ", "2          \n \n6.  In addition, a considerable amount of analytical work has been done on the subject. \nWhile preparing its first Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2005\u20132007) for CAREC \nMember Countries, ADB commissioned a number of studies pertaining to regional economic \ncooperation in Central Asia, including assessments of regional organizations and the regional \ncooperation experience, a reassessment of the regional transport sector strategy, a study of the \nwater and energy nexus, and reviews of trade and trade facilitation in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The International Monetary Fund prepared a paper on \ntrade and trade potential in the CIS-7 countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, \nMoldova, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan). The World Bank prepared a transport and trade audit for \neach of the CARs and a paper on transport and trade facilitation issues in the CIS-7 countries, \nKazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. \n \n7.  Nonetheless,  overall  progress  on  regional  economic  cooperation  has  so  far  been \nmodest. In particular, there remain significant barriers to trade, including the marked divergence \nof trade policies pursued by individual CARs, inadequacies of the region's transport network, \nand deficiencies of the existing transit arrangements. In several instances, CARs have opted for \nthe construction of a new road bypassing a neighboring country to overcome difficulties with \ntransit through that country, while the region's transport links with South and East Asia remain \nunderdeveloped and many existing roads need rehabilitation and upgrading. Lack of regional \neconomic cooperation, especially in the areas of trade, transport, and transit, has hampered the \nintegration of the CARs into the world economy and the full realization of the region's significant \neconomic potential. \n \n8.  A number of factors have been cited as constraints on regional economic cooperation \namong the CARs.3 They include lack of political will and mutual trust, antipathy to supra-national \ninstitutions and arrangements, pursuit of national self-reliance and self-sufficiency in strategic \ngoods and services, growing divergence in economic policies and prospects, weak institutional \nand management capacities, uncertainty about the magnitude and distribution of costs and \nbenefits  of  cooperation,  and  the  relative  weakness  of  constituencies  supporting  regional \neconomic cooperation. Overcoming these formidable constraints requires, among others, further \nanalytical work. \n \n9.  Existing  studies  on  regional  economic  cooperation  in  Central  Asia  focus largely  on \nreviewing the status of, and identifying priorities for increasing, cooperation in specific areas. \nWhile  the  potential  benefits  of  regional  economic  cooperation  for  the  CARs  have  been \nascertained, little has been done to quantify these benefits and the associated costs. Likewise, \na comprehensive and in-depth analysis of constraints on regional economic cooperation is yet \nto be done, although the more important of these constraints have been identified. The impact \nof regional economic cooperation or noncooperation on competitiveness, economic growth, \ngovernance, employment, and poverty in the CARs has not adequately been displayed. Most \nexisting studies have been conducted by international experts with limited participation of local \nexperts. Consequently, they lack local ownership. \n \n10.  Further analytical work can contribute to increased regional economic cooperation in \nseveral ways. First, quantitative assessments of gains and losses from increased regional \neconomic  cooperation  for  individual  CARs  and  key  stakeholders  in  them\u2014combined  with \n                                                 \n3  See for example, ADB. 2003. An Assessment of Regional Cooperation Experience in Central Asia. Manila; ADB. \n2004. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2005-2007) for the CAREC Member Countries. Manila; and \nWorld Bank. 2003. Central Asia Regional Framework. Washington, DC. \n ", "        3   \ncompelling demonstration of its potential positive impact on competitiveness, economic growth, \ngovernance, employment, and poverty\u2014will reduce the uncertainty about costs and benefits of \nregional cooperation, strengthen constituencies for cooperation, enhance the CARs' willingness \nto  cooperate,  and  help  them  work  out  mutually  beneficial  arrangements  for  cooperation. \nSimilarly,  disentangling  a  complex  web  of  political,  geopolitical,  institutional,  and  other \nconstraints will help the international community develop feasible and effective approaches to, \nand strategies for, moving regional economic cooperation forward. If this analytical work is done \nin a participatory manner, involving consultations with key stakeholders and close collaboration \nwith local institutions and experts, it will not only benefit from local insights and have broad \nownership, but also promote public dialogue on the subject and help build a network of local \ninstitutions and experts supporting regional economic cooperation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The overall goal of the TA is to promote regional economic cooperation in Central Asia. \nIts purpose is to enhance the analytical underpinnings of regional cooperation in Central Asia in \nthe areas of trade, transport, and transit.  \n \n12.  The expected TA outputs are \n \n(i)  an ADB report on Central Asia regional cooperation in trade, transport and transit \n(the annotated outline of the report is given in Appendix 2); and \n \n(ii)  a  chapter  on  trade,  transport,  and  transit  for  the  UNDP  report  on  regional \ncooperation for human development and security in Central Asia. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  build  on  and  complement  the  analytical  work  on  regional  economic \ncooperation in Central Asia already done by ADB and other MIs. The report to be prepared \nunder the TA will draw extensively from recent ADB studies on economic cooperation among \nCAREC member countries, particularly with respect to the status of and priorities for regional \ncooperation in the areas of trade, transport, and transit. It will also provide \n \n(i)  qualitative and quantitative assessments of potential gains and losses, resulting \nfrom increased regional cooperation in trade, transport, and transit, for individual \nCAREC member countries and key stakeholders in them; and \n \n(ii)  a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the constraints on and options for \nfostering  regional  cooperation  in  those  areas  among  the  CAREC  member \ncountries. \n \n14.  The report will consider regional cooperation in trade among CAREC member countries \nas a way to achieve closer economic integration not only with each other, but also with the rest \nof the world. Regional cooperation in transport and transit will be considered as essential means \nof facilitating both intra- and inter-regional trade. Opportunities for increased cooperation in \ntrade, transport, and transit between CAREC member countries and their neighbors, including \nAfghanistan,  Iran,  Russian  Federation,  and  Turkmenistan,  will  be  explored.  The  impact  of \nregional  cooperation  in  the  three  areas  or  the  lack  thereof  on  competitiveness,  economic \ngrowth, governance, employment, and poverty will be emphasized. \n \n ", "4          \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The goal and purpose of the TA will be pursued by undertaking the following activities: \n \n(i)  Prepare background sector notes on regional cooperation in trade, transport, and \ntransit,  among  CAREC  member  countries,  in  part  drawing  from  recent  ADB \nstudies on regional economic cooperation in Central Asia. \n \n(ii)  Estimate the intra- and inter-regional trade potential of CAREC member countries \nwith and without barriers to trade regimes, transport, and transit. \n \n(iii)  Develop a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for two CAREC member \ncountries (for which this model will be deemed relatively easy to develop) and \nestimate  the  potential  impact  of  increased  regional  cooperation  in  trade, \ntransport, and transit on their economies, using the CGE models. \n \n(iv)  Analyze how individual CAREC member countries and key stakeholders in them \nwill be affected by increased regional cooperation in trade, transport, and transit, \nusing  case  studies  demonstrating  costs  and  benefits  of  cooperation  or \nnoncooperation for some of these stakeholders. \n \n(v)  Analyze constraints on, and options for, fostering regional economic cooperation \namong CAREC member countries, taking into account the difficulties arising from \nthe need for collective action and the influence various stakeholders in CAREC \nmember countries exert on decisions concerning regional economic cooperation. \n \n(vi)  Consolidate  the  above  notes,  estimates,  and  analyses  into  a  coherent  and \nconsistent ADB report on regional cooperation in trade, transport, and transit \namong CAREC member countries. \n \n(vii)  Disseminate the report.  \n \n(viii)  Prepare  a  chapter  on  trade,  transport,  and  transit  for  the  UNDP  report  on \nregional cooperation for human development and security in Central Asia. \n \n16.  All  these  activities  will  be  undertaken  in  close  collaboration  with  UNDP  and  local \ninstitutions and experts from CAREC member countries. An early draft of the ADB report will be \npresented  to  and  discussed  with  governments  of  CAREC  member  countries  and  other \nstakeholders. It is hoped that the preparation and subsequent dissemination of the report will \ncontribute to \n \n(i)  strengthened local capacity for policy analysis and information management in \nthe area of regional trade, transport, and transit, and building a network of local \ninstitutions and experts supporting regional economic cooperation; \n \n(ii)  improved  dialogue  among  various  stakeholders  on  regional  economic \ncooperation; and  \n \n(iii)  greater  public  awareness  of  the  need  for  increased  regional  economic \ncooperation. \n \n ", "        5   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $350,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's TA funding program. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Operations Coordination Division, East and Central Asia Department, will be the \nExecuting Agency for the TA. A team comprising ADB staff members and consultants will \nimplement the TA. To ensure full ADB ownership of the TA outputs and leadership in the TA \nactivities, an ADB project officer will serve as team leader, guide and coordinate the work of \nother team members, and consolidate their inputs into an ADB report on Central Asia regional \ncooperation in trade, transport, and transit.4 The team will collaborate closely with local research \ninstitutions from CAREC member countries and the UNDP team in charge of the report on \nregional cooperation for human development and security in Central Asia. TA implementation \nwill be synchronized with the preparation of the UNDP report. It is expected to start in August \n2004 and end in August 2005. \n \n19.  The services of four international consultants for a total of 9.0 person-months and of \nseven  domestic  consultants  for  a  total  of  48  person-months  will  be  required.  International \nexperts (person-months are in parentheses) in trade (4.0), transport (1.5), and transit (1.5) will \nprepare background sector notes on regional cooperation in the three areas among CAREC \nmember  countries.  The  international  expert  in  trade  will  also  assist  the  team  leader  in \nconsolidating inputs provided by team members into the ADB report and will draft a chapter on \ntrade, transport, and transit for the UNDP report. An international expert in economic modeling \n(2.0 person-months) will develop a CGE model for two CAREC member countries. Using these \nmodels, the expert will assess the potential impact of increased regional cooperation in trade, \ntransport, and transit on their economies. One domestic consultant (9.0 person-months for \ncountries for which a CGE model will be developed and 6.0 for the others) will be engaged in \neach of the CAREC member countries to provide country-specific inputs to the ADB report and \nthe chapter for the UNDP report. One of these domestic consultants will act as deputy team \nleader.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  as  individuals  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are given in Appendix 4. \n \n20.  Outputs of the TA will be widely disseminated. In particular, the ADB report on Central \nAsia  regional  cooperation  in  trade,  transport,  and  transit  will  be  printed  and  distributed \nworldwide. It will also be featured in ADB's web site. \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis for \nCentral Asia Regional Cooperation in Trade, Transport, and Transit, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                 \n4 Travel and related expenses incurred by ADB in connection with its staff providing analytical inputs to the TA will be \ncharged to the TA budget.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \n     \nIncreased regional economic  An increase in total trade  Direction of trade statistics \ncooperation in Central Asia  turnover among Central Asia  published by International \nRegional Economic  Monetary Fund (IMF) \nCooperation (CAREC) \nmember countries \nPurpose       \n       \nEnhanced analytical  Qualitative and quantitative     \nunderpinnings of regional  assessments of potential     \ncooperation in Central Asia in  gains and losses, resulting     \nthe areas of trade, transport,  from increased regional     \nand transit  cooperation in trade,    Enhanced analytical \ntransport, and transit, for  The Asian Development  underpinning of regional \nindividual CAREC member  Bank (ADB) report on  cooperation in Central \ncountries and key  Central Asia regional  Asia in the areas of trade, \nstakeholders within them  cooperation in trade,  transport, and transit will \n  transport, and transit  serve to increase regional \nA comprehensive and in-   economic cooperation. \ndepth analysis of constraints \non and options for fostering \nregional cooperation in trade, \ntransport, and transit among \nCAREC member countries \nOutputs       \n       \nAn ADB report on Central  The report assessed  Comments on the report   \nAsia regional cooperation in  positively by peer reviewers  provided by peer reviewers   \ntrade, transport, and transit       \n      ADB report and the \nA chapter on regional  The chapter assessed  Feedback from United  chapter for the UNDP \ncooperation in trade,  positively by UNDP and peer  Nations Development  report will be of good \ntransport, and transit for the  reviewers of its report  Programme (UNDP)  quality \nUNDP report on regional   \ncooperation for human  Comments on the draft \ndevelopment and security in  UNDP report provided by its \nCentral Asia  peer reviewers \nActivities       \n       \nPrepare background sector  Background notes prepared  Dates when international  The background sector \nnotes on regional cooperation  by end-November 2004   experts in trade, transport,  notes will be of good quality. \nin trade, transport, and transit    transit will submit their sector   \namong the CAREC member    notes to ADB   \ncountries.        \n       \nEstimate the intra- and inter- Estimates made by end- The sector note by the  The governments of the \nregional trade potential of the  November 2004  international expert in trade  CAREC member countries \nCAREC member countries    will provide the data needed \nwith and without trade barriers  for the estimation. \npertaining to trade regimes,   \ntransport, and transit. \nContinued on next page.", "    Appendix 1  7   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\u2014Continued \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nDevelop a computable  The initial version of the     \ngeneral equilibrium (CGE)  models completed and     \nmodel for two CAREC  preliminary assessments     \nmember countries and  made by end-November  The CGE models and  Data needed for the \nestimate the potential impact  2004    assessments provided by  development of the models \nof increased regional    the international expert in  will largely be collected by \ncooperation in trade,  Final version of the models  economic modeling   end-October 2004. \ntransport, and transit on their  completed and final     \neconomies, using the CGE  assessments made by end-    \nmodels.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Introduction will give an overview of the report, including its purpose and scope. It \nwill also introduce the chapters of the report. \n \nB.  Chapter 1. Analytical Framework  \n \n2.  This  chapter  will  define  and  describe  regional  cooperation  among  the  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) member countries in the areas of trade, transport, \nand transit. It will also underscore the importance of regional cooperation among the CAREC \nmember countries in these areas for closer economic integration with each other and the rest of \nthe world and, ultimately, for competitiveness, economic growth, employment generation, and \npoverty reduction in the region. The chapter will explore and stress the linkages and synergies \nbetween trade, transport, and transit in helping achieve these development goals for the region. \nIn  this  context,  the  chapter  will  provide  some  background  information  about  the  CAREC \nmember countries and assess the impact of the disintegration of the former Soviet Union on \ntrade and production in Central Asia. \n \nC.  Chapter 2. Regional Cooperation in Trade  \n \n3.  Recent Trade Patterns and Current Trade Regimes. This section will analyze recent \ntrade  patterns  (including  geographical  direction  and  commodity  composition  of  trade)  and \nexisting trade regimes in the CAREC member countries, with focus on intraregional trade. It will \nalso examine key determinants of the trade patterns. \n \n4.  Trade Barriers and Trade Potential. This section will identify the main barriers to intra- \nand inter-regional trade (including those pertaining to trade regimes currently in place in the \nCAREC member countries, weaknesses of the transport sector, deficiencies of the existing \ntransit arrangements in the region, and access to markets outside the region) and assess their \nimpact  on  competitiveness,  economic  growth,  governance,  employment,  and  poverty  in \nindividual CAREC member countries (by including case studies and quantitative assessments). \nThe section will also present estimates of the intra- and inter-regional trade potential of the \nCAREC member countries, with and without those barriers, based on the gravity model. \n \n5.  Options  for  Regional  Cooperation.  This  section  will  discuss  options  for  regional \ncooperation in trade among the CAREC member countries (including harmonization of trade \npolicies,  joint  efforts  to  gain  greater  access  to  markets  outside  the  region,  coordinated \nmultilateral trade liberalization, regional trade arrangements possibly involving other countries, \nand pros and cons of alternative arrangements). In this context, the section will review the \nexisting regional trade arrangements involving CAREC member countries. It will also examine \nrecent  proposals  pertaining  to  regional  trade  cooperation  and  implications  of  prospective \naccession of CAREC member countries and their neighbors to the World Trade Organization. \n \n6.  Potential Cost and Benefits of Increased Regional Cooperation.

Potential negative \nconsequences of creating such a transit system (including possible increase in smuggling and \ndrug trafficking) will be examined. The section will discuss legal, regulatory, institutional, and \nother reforms the CAREC member countries will need to implement to create a transit system \nconducive  to  intra-  and  inter-regional  trade,  while  minimizing  its  possible  negative \nconsequences. \n \n ", "   Appendix 2      11 \n \nF.  Chapter 5. Constraints on Regional Cooperation and the Way Forward  \n \n11.  This chapter will analyze main constraints on regional cooperation among the CAREC \nmember countries in trade, transport, and transit (including political and geopolitical constraints; \ninstitutional weaknesses; poor governance; and difficulties arising from the need for collective \naction and strategic interaction among various stakeholders). In this context, the chapter will \nidentify main winners and losers from increased regional cooperation in the three areas. On the \nbasis of this analysis, the chapter will discuss what would be the feasible and most effective \noptions for fostering regional cooperation in trade, transport, and transit with reference to the \ncurrent arrangements and proposals under consideration.  \n \nG.  Conclusions and Recommendations \n \n12.  The  last  section  will  summarize  the  findings  of  the  report  and  recommend  how  to \nincrease regional cooperation among the CAREC member countries in the areas of trade, \ntransport,  and  transit.  It  will  also  present  baselines  and  benchmarks  against  which  future \nprogress on regional cooperation in these areas can be measured. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \nItem  Total Costa\n1.
