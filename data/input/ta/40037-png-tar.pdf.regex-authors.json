The programming discussions in 2005 between the Government of Papua New Guinea \n(PNG) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified the development of Lae port as a \npotential project for ADB financing; a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was included \nin ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update 2005\u22122006.1 Responding to an official request \nsent by the Government in January 2006, the Fact-Finding Mission2 visited PNG from 21 \nFebruary to 3 March 2006. Based on extensive consultations with central and local government \nagencies,  the  private  sector,  funding  agencies,  landowners,  civil  societies,  nongovernment \norganizations, and faith and community-based organizations, the Mission defined the rationale, \nscope of study, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing plan, and terms of \nreference for consulting services for the TA.3 The TA will prepare the proposed Lae Port \nDevelopment  Project\u2014Tidal  Basin  Phase  I  for  potential  ADB  investment.  A  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.    ISSUES \n \n2.  PNG is an island country, comprising the eastern half of New Guinea and 600 other \noffshore islands. The total land area is approximately 462,000 square kilometers, accounting for \nmore than 80% of the total land area in the South Pacific. Its mainland consists of rugged \nmountain ranges, fertile upland valleys, coastal plains, and extensive swamps. It has a coastline \nof more than 17,000 kilometers and 17 million hectares of reef-covered coastal waters, making \nit the largest fishing zone in the Pacific. Thirteen of the country\u2019s 19 provinces are coastal. \n \n3.  PNG is richly endowed with mineral, forestry, and fishery resources, and eco-conditions \nfor agricultural production, and enjoys proximity to Australian and Asian markets. In spite of its \ndevelopment potential, PNG\u2019s economic and social performance, since independence in 1975, \nhas been disappointing. Economic growth averaged around 3% in the 1980s and 1% in the \n1990s, and was negative from 2000 to 2002. The economy recovered in 2003 and 2004, with \nreal gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimated at 2.8% and 3%, respectively, because of \n(i)  favorable  international  commodity  prices,  (ii)  resumption  of  petroleum,  gold  and  copper \nproduction, and (iii) improved macroeconomic management. The long period of low economic \ngrowth took a toll on infrastructure, social services, poverty, and law and order. Roads, wharves, \njetties, and airstrips are deteriorating due to lack of funding for maintenance, hindering private \nsector investment. Education and health services are declining or not delivered. The incidence \nof poverty increased from 37.5% in 1996 to 54% in 2003. HIV/AIDS is spreading. In terms of the \nhuman development index, PNG ranked 133 out of 177 countries in 2004.  \n \n4.  PNG\u2019s economy is highly dualistic, with a small modern sector coexisting with a large \nsubsistence sector. Only 15% of the population is in the modern sector, having a stable source \nof income. The rest of the population lives in rural areas, surviving on subsistence and cash \ncrop  agricultural  production.  Consumption  constitutes  some  60\u201370%  of  GDP,  and  capital \nformation, only 12\u201317%. Mining and agriculture are the major industries. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Papua New Guinea: Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006). Manila. \n2  The Mission comprised Cai Li, Project Specialist/Mission Leader; M. J. Minc, Principal Infrastructure Specialist; F. \nTornieri, Social Development Specialist; and P. E. Clos, Counsel. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 March 2006. ", "2     \n5.  Due to the archipelagic nature of the country and rugged terrain, which creates widely \ndispersed  population  pockets,  limiting  mobility  and  opportunities  to  develop  the  domestic \nmarket,  PNG  relies  heavily  on  trade,  particularly  exports,  for  economic  growth  and  fiscal \nrevenue. Exports rose steadily from $985 million in 1980 to $2,529 million in 2004; growth of \nimports was moderate. As a percentage of GDP, exports increased from 35% in 1986 to almost \n48% in 2002; during this period the percentage rose to more than 50% in some years. Imports \nas a percentage of GDP stayed close to 30%. Mineral, petroleum, and agricultural products \nsuch as cocoa, coffee, copper, copra, gold, palm oil, and petroleum are PNG\u2019s major export \nitems. PNG relies on imports for both capital and consumer goods.  \n \n6.  The port sector provides a vital link between PNG and the world market, with more than \n80% of PNG exports shipped from ports. PNG has 22 declared ports, with numerous publicly \nand privately operated wharves, jetties, and landings. Papua New Guinea Harbours Limited \n(PNGHL), a statutory authority 100% owned by the Government, is mandated to maintain and \noperate the 22 ports; only 16 are operational. In 2004, they handled a total of 5.01 million tons \nof general cargo, and 195,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs)  of containerized cargo. \nPNGHL\u2019s net profit after tax for the year was K17,664,569.  \n  \n7.  The city of Lae is PNG\u2019s industrial and commercial trade center. Lae port, the largest \nport in PNG, is centrally located and is on most Pacific shipping routes. It serves as the principal \ngateway for the highlands region, which is the most populous region in the country and richly \nendowed with natural resources including gold, oil, and gas; and eco-conditions for growing \ncoffee, cocoa, and tea. PNG\u2019s most significant road\u2014Highlands Highway\u2014runs from Lae to the \nhighland  provinces,  bringing  the  country\u2019s  major  export  items  to  Lae  port  and  distributing \nimports ranging from heavy machinery to food products to the region. In 2004, of the total cargo \npassing through the 16 ports, Lae port accounted for around 51% of general cargo and 56% of \ncontainerized cargo. About 50% of PNG exports and 90% of coffee exports are handled through \nLae port. \n \n8.  Built in the 1930s, Lae port started as a small conventional cargo port, handling mostly \nbreak-bulk cargo. Since 1995, cargo throughput has been growing at an annual rate of 3.4%. \nConsistent with the container revolution in the shipping sector, container cargo has registered \nhigher growth of 5% per annum, compared with general cargo, which has grown at an annual \nrate of 2.5%. The size of vessels calling Lae port for coastal trade has increased from 70\u221280 \nmeters (m) to 100\u2212120 m, and for international trade, from 150 m to 200 m. The current cargo \nvolume and vessel types calling the port require at least four international berths with a total \nlength of 800 m. \n \n9.  Over  the  past  decade,  Lae  port  has  been  adapting  to  the  demands  of  container \noperations. However, the pace of investing in maintaining, rationalizing, and adding new port \nfacilities has not kept pace with the growing trend toward containerization and larger ships. The \ncurrent five berths4 at Lae, with a total length of approximately 520 m, and a total storage area \nof 52,600 square m (m2)5 for cargo marshalling, are aging and insufficient to handle increasing \ncargo volumes and ship size. Berth 4 for domestic ships is underutilized as it can no longer \naccommodate these ships. Berth 1, with a length of 123 m and water depth of 11 m, is suitable \nfor overseas vessels, but was damaged by an earthquake in 2000 and is now used as a \ndomestic terminal. Overseas vessels are mainly serviced by berths 2 and 3, which have a total \nlength of 307 m. As a result, port congestion at Lae is frequent, imposing high costs on port \n                                                 \n4  Including a tanker berth. \n5  Including a covered storage of 12,600 m2 and open storage of 39,000 m2. ", "  3\nusers. According to a shipping company, delays of 3\u20135 days have become the norm rather than \nthe exception, and a 1-day delay in the harbor costs the company $20,000 per day. Some \nvessels are turning away from the port. Others are considering imposing congestion charges, \nwhich will translate into higher costs for importers and exporters, and eventually, consumers \nand the general economy. Port congestion also poses health and safety issues, and the issue of \ncompliance with the International Shipping and Port Security Code.  \n \n10.  The 15% rise in cargo volume since 2003 has stretched Lae port beyond its capacity. \nThe situation is expected to deteriorate, considering the Government\u2019s development strategy \nand  ongoing  or  potential  economic  activities  in  the  highlands  region.  In  its  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Strategy  (2005\u22122010),6  the  Government  defined  its  overarching  development \nstrategy as export-driven economic growth, rural development, and poverty reduction. In line \nwith  its  strategy,  the  Government  is  investing  in  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  Highlands \nHighway, and attracting investment in mining projects in the highlands region. Some gas, oil, \ngold, copper, and nickel projects are already, or will soon be, under way. The world price for \ncoffee is still climbing in favor of PNG, which produces one of the best quality coffees in the \nworld. All these will contribute to the growth of traffic through Lae port, increasing stress on the \nport facilities.  \n \n11.  As early as the 1970s, PNGHL had a plan to expand port capacity by developing a tidal \nbasin project in the swamp area to the west of the existing facilities. ADB assessed the project \nand approved a loan in 1980. Unfortunately, the project did not proceed due to an unexpected \ndispute relating to land ownership between a tribal group claiming customary landownership \nand PNGHL.7 Sluggish economic growth in the following two decades discouraged not only \ninvestment  in  the  tidal  basin  project,  but  also  adequate  maintenance  of  the  existing  port \nfacilities. Improved economic performance and steady increase of the cargo throughput at Lae \nport since 2003 have generated revenues for the Government and PNGHL. The Government \nhas allocated K15 million from the budget to extend the length of berth 3. The project is \ncurrently at the stage of contract award and is expected to be completed by late 2007. Using its \nown financial resources, PNGHL successfully completed the dredging in 2004, increasing water \ndepth from 8 m to 13.6 m. It has embarked on a number of short-term projects, including \nconstructing a new container storage area of 10,250 m2, repairing berth 1 to its original state, \nremoving two sheds to expand the storage area for container cargo, and installing reefer outlets \nand a standby generator. The total investment is about K15 million. \n \n12.  The Government and PNGHL recognize that these quick solutions are necessary but \ninsufficient to alleviate the bottleneck, and are seeking funding for the following subprojects: \n  \n(i)  construction of a new passenger and coastal trade berth; \n \n(ii)  reconstruction of berth 1 into a full overseas container berth by backfilling the \nponds, reinforcing hard stand, and connecting with berth 4; and \n \n(iii)  tidal basin phase I project, which includes (a) dredging and reclamation works \ninvolving over 2.2 million cubic meters of hydraulic fill; (b) slope protection works \nof 20,000 m2; (c) construction of an overseas berth (wharf) of 180 m; container \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n6   PNG Government. 2004.

The  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission  carried  out  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment \n(Appendix 2) and conducted extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the \ncentral and local governments, private sector, funding agencies, landowners, civil societies, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  faith  and  community-based  organizations  regarding  the \nneed for and scope of the Lae port project and social risks associated with the project. The \nMission was impressed by the enthusiasm and widespread support for the proposed project. \nThe spirit of cooperation, partnership, participation, and working for the common good revealed \nduring the consultations are particularly encouraging.  \n \n \nIII.    THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The TA aims to design and prepare the Lae Port Development Project\u2014Tidal Basin \nPhase  I  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  overarching  development  strategy  of  export-driven \neconomic growth, rural development, and poverty reduction. The outcome will be a project \ndesign and feasibility study agreed to by the Government and ADB.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will (i) provide a sound macroeconomic and sector context for the proposed \ninvestment project by critically assessing the status and prospect of PNG\u2019s economic, social, \nand  trade  performance;  and  conducting  a  comprehensive  port  sector  analysis; \n(ii) comprehensively assess Lae port, including port facilities, services provided, operations, \nperformance, efficiency, tariff structure, customs procedure, private sector participation, and \nlogistic  chains;  (iii)  undertake  traffic  surveys  and  market  analysis,  and  project  capacity \nrequirement for Lae port using the up-to-date modeling method; (vi) design project components \nand project performance monitoring framework, identify performance targets and socioeconomic \nimpact indicators, and establish measuring mechanism; (v) update and refine the feasibility \nstudy for the proposed project; and confirm technical, economic, and financial viability of the \nproject;  (vi)  undertake  financial  assessment,  socioeconomic  analysis  among  stakeholders, \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  and  resettlement  planning;  and  ensure  financial  due \ndiligence and due diligence on social and environmental safeguards, and establish baseline \ndata;  (vii)  promote  public  consultations,  participation,  and  private-public  partnership;  (viii) \nexplore the possibility of cofinancing; (ix) undertake site investigations, and prepare detailed \nengineering design and bidding documents; (x) establish and maintain a functional project \nimplementation office; and (xi) propose financing arrangements for an ADB loan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.125 million equivalent. The Government has \nasked ADB to provide $900,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  finance \n$225,000 in kind by providing office accommodation and support services, local communication \nand transport, and other services and facilities required for TA implementation. The detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are attached as Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  PNGHL  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  PNGHL  will  provide  adequately \nfurnished offices in both Lae (main office) and Port Moresby; and assign counterpart staff, \nincluding at least one engineer, to work with the international consulting team. PNGHL will also \nbe responsible for coordinating and liaising with relevant government agencies and ADB. \n \n18.  The TA will require a total of 35 person-months of international (24) and domestic (11) \nconsulting services to carry out the scope of the study as described in the outline terms of \nreference in Appendix 4. The areas of expertise required include port planning, port engineering \ndesign,  transport  economics  and  socioeconomics,  financial  assessment  and  analysis, \nenvironmental impact assessment, and resettlement planning.  \n \n19.  The TA will be carried out by an international consulting firm in association with a \ndomestic  firm  or  a  team  of  domestic  individual  consultants.  The  firm  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006) and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants, using the simplified technical \nproposal procedures based on the quality-based selection method\u2014justified because of the \ntechnical, economic, and environmental uncertainty associated with the project.  \n \n20.  The  consultant  will  produce  the  required  outputs  and  reports  in  accordance  with \nAppendix 4, para, 13, and provide ADB and the Government with three copies each of each \noutput and report. Electronic versions will also be required. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months on an intermittent basis, including 5 months \nfor  designing  the  project  and  ensuring  due  diligence  on  technical,  economic,  financial, \nenvironmental,  social,  and  resettlement  viability;  and  6  months  for  preparing  project \nimplementation. The TA will commence in October 2006 and end in January 2008.  \n \n \nVI.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea for preparing the Lae Port Development Project-Tidal \nBasin Phase I, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  \u2022 Additional port  \u2022  Reports and records of   Assumptions \nIncreased capacity and  facilities including  PNG Harbours Limited  \u2022  Political stability \nefficiency of Lae port  overseas berths,  \u2022  Project performance  \u2022  Road conditions of \nstorage areas, reefer  monitoring reports  Highlands Highway and \nfacilities, road  \u2022  Surveys of port users   connecting roads improve \nnetworks, and utilities  \u2022  Favorable international \n\u2022 Increased cargo  commodity prices \nthroughput  \u2022  Favorable weather \n\u2022 Reduced port  conditions  \ncongestion   \n\u2022 Reduced cost for port  Risks \nusers   \u2022  Land disputes \n \nOutcome  \u2022 Memorandum of  \u2022  Memorandum of  Assumptions \nProject design and  understanding signed  understanding  \u2022  Government priorities do \nfeasibility study agreed  by the Government    not change \nby the Government and  and ADB during  \u2022  Government does not \nADB    appraisal mission of  seek other sources of \nJune 2006  funding  \n    \n \nOutputs  \u2022 Draft final report  \u2022  ADB document  Assumption \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Papua New Guinea: \n \nAccording to the 2000 census, between 1980 and 2000, PNG's population grew by an annual average rate of 2.7% to \n5.19 million. Approximately half of the population is under 19 years old. PNG's population has recently suffered \nsignificant declines in living standards due to worsening economic performance. Poverty estimates have not been \nupdated since the last household survey in 1996. Although the country does not exhibit the widespread abject poverty \npresent in some developing countries, World Bank projections (2005) show the proportion of poor living under the \nnational poverty line at 53% in 2003, compared with 37.5% in the benchmark year of 1996. The proportion of the \npopulation living on less than $1 a day is estimated to have increased from 24.6% in 1996 to 39.1% in 2003. Many \nhealth indicators have deteriorated in recent years, including the availability and performance of health facilities. \nImmunization and infant mortality rates have deteriorated since 1990. PNG is the only Pacific island country \nconsidered to have a generalized epidemic of HIV. \n \nPNG\u2019s human development index has improved since the mid-1970s, but very slowly. In 2005, PNG ranked 137th, \nreflecting  alarming  economic  and  social  intracountry  disparities.  On  the  poverty  index  of  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, PNG ranks 68th among developing countries. It ranks last among Pacific developing \nmember countries on both indexes, with great challenges in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. PNG's \nmain social indicators, such as life expectancy and maternal and child mortality rates, show improvements since 1975, \nbut are still well below the averages for lower middle-income countries. PNG still has limited primary health care. \nInfectious diseases are claiming many lives, and serious public health risks result from endemic diseases such as \nmalaria and the ever-increasing HIV/AIDS epidemic. A general HIV epidemic is under way, with prevalence rates \namong 15\u201349 year-olds at 3\u20134% in Port Moresby, well over 2% in other urban areas, and over 1% in rural areas. In \neducation, the rate of participation in primary schooling is improving, but it remains lower than in most other countries \nin the region. \n \nMost of the population lives in rural communities based on the traditional village structure and depend on subsistence \nfarming supplemented by cash cropping. Only 15\u201320% of Papua New Guineans live in the main urban areas of Port \nMoresby, Lae, Madang, Mt Hagan, and Goroka. PNG has a relatively small dual economy, comprising a formal and \ninformal economy. The formal economy is dominated by large-scale resource projects, particularly in mining and \npetroleum, and provides a large proportion of government revenue. The informal economy supports 85% of the people \nthrough  semi-subsistence  agriculture.  The  formal  sector  employs  around  15%  of  the  workforce.  PNG  has  an \nabundance of natural resources, including (i) large reserves of minerals; (ii) extensive forestry and fishery assets; \n(iii) significant potential for agricultural expansion; and (iv) many locations with potential for ecological and cultural \ntourism. Despite the potential of these resources, PNG's economic performance has fallen short of expectations. \nEconomic growth has not kept up with population growth and performance varies considerably from year to year.  \n \nThe proposed Lae port project is in line with the Government\u2019s Medium Term Development Strategy, which highlights \nthe importance of export-driven economic growth, rural development and poverty reduction, and the priorities set forth \nin the (draft) national poverty reduction strategy, which is structured around five pillars: (i) strengthen governance, \n(ii) increase development of land and natural resource, (iii) improve and maintain physical infrastructure, (iv) improve \nand expand economic growth opportunities, and (v) strengthen and expand social services. The project will contribute \nto export-led economic growth and income generation by improving port infrastructure. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe project preparatory TA consultant will carry out a socioeconomic and poverty assessment among stakeholders \nand prepare gender-disaggregated socioeconomic and poverty profiles for project stakeholders, with information on \nemployment status (with emphasis on gendered division of labor), asset and resource ownership, income data, \ndegree of skills and knowledge base, social cohesion, and community organization. Critical needs and constraints \nfaced by local communities in fully benefiting from the employment and business opportunities associated with the \n(anticipated) increase in road and port traffic and connectivity, as well as their ability to respond to the inherent health \nand /or HIV/AIDS risks associated with the road rehabilitation and/or upgrade will also be assessed.
