The Government of India requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) to prepare the agribusiness development support project. \nThe aim is  to develop economically viable projects in agribusiness, with a particular focus on \nimproved storage and greater value added in the processing and marketing chains so as to \nimprove efficiency and reduce postharvest losses.1 A TA Reconnaissance Mission visited India on \n11\u201322 March 2004, and a TA Fact-Finding Mission on 1\u201317 July 2004 reached an understanding \nwith the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. These were defined through a consultative \nprocess as part of advisory TA, and included central Government, state governments, external \nfunding agencies, private sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), policy researchers, and \nfarmer  groups.2  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  2004  program  for  India.3  A  preliminary  project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The agriculture sector is the core of India\u2019s Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007). The Plan \nnotes the achievements of the food security perspective that guided agriculture sector policies and \nprograms for three decades, but suggests that the true potential of Indian agriculture will be \nrealized  only  with  diversification  of  agricultural  products.  Agricultural  production  and  linked \nprocessing,  distribution,  trade,  financial,  and  commercial  activities  have  a  large  potential  for \nsustaining  the  demand  for  labor,  improving  the  quality  of  employment,  and  meeting  the \nconsumption  needs  of  a  growing  population.  The  Government's  economic  objectives  place \nemphasis  on  generating  gainful  employment  in  agriculture.  Food  processing  is  seen  as  an \nimportant employment-generating activity. However, its success is linked to close integration of the \nvalue chain, including production, manufacturing, distribution, and wholesale and retail sales of \nagricultural commodities. It is clear that more efficient outcomes can generally be achieved if the \nprivate sector is involved in developing market-driven opportunities. Ongoing reforms recognize the \nneed for participation of the private and cooperative sectors in agricultural marketing. At the same \ntime,  complementary  public  investments  are  needed  to  correct  market  failures  and  efficiently \nprovide core public goods. \n \n3.  While India is the second largest producer of food in the world, value addition is low and  \nthe size of the processing sector is small. The supply chain for agricultural commodities\u2014which is \nthe core that sustains agribusiness\u2014is marked by serious inefficiencies. The supply chain is long, \nbut with incommensurate value added in terms of sorting, grading, storage, and bulk-handling \nfacilities. Physical wastage is high and so are marketing margins.4 Large-scale investment is \nnecessary to overcome these inefficiencies. The world over, large agribusinesses are commodity \nprocessors and chain retailers. These businesses have prospered by investing in the supply \nchain\u2014in  production  (by  disseminating  better  varieties),  procurement  and  collection  centers, \ngrading, bulk storage, and handling facilities. As a result, food chains in the developed countries \nhave evolved to become efficient. A similar pattern is emerging in rapidly developing countries of \nAsia, such as the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2003\u20132006): India. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for the Agribusiness and Commercial Agriculture Assessment. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 November 2003.  \n4  According to one estimate, 30% of horticulture products are wasted every year due to rough handling, inadequate \npackaging, and lack of temperature control.  Wastage occurs even in less perishable grains because of inefficient \nhandling, repeated bagging, and poor storage. Apart from physical wastage, there are inefficiencies in the supply chain \nin terms of loss in quality and excessive cost of the large number of intermediaries in the chain. \n ", "2 \n \n4.  The  major  constraints  to  agribusiness  and  commercial  agriculture  development  at  the \nnational  level  are  well-documented.5  They  include  (i)  agriculture  not  being  market-driven;  (ii) \ndistorted incentive structures; (iii) a multiplicity of laws, regulations, and taxes; (iv) inadequate \nbackward and forward linkages; (v) poor infrastructure, especially for marketing; (vi) the poor state \nof markets and the way they transact; (vii) inadequate outreach of services and credit to farmers; \n(viii)  lack  of  modern  storage  techniques  and  transportation  methods;  and  (ix)  inadequate \ninformation on and linkage with standards and requirements for exports. In addition to a national \noverview of sector issues, five states were identified for an initial assessment of agribusiness and \ncommercial agriculture investment constraints and opportunities (footnote 2). The states represent \na diverse spread of agricultural development and agro-ecological potential (Appendix 2). From \nstakeholder consultations at the central and state levels, broad investment priorities have been \nidentified for each state. \n \n 5.  Access to credit for the agriculture sector remains a constraint. Major concerns identified by \nrecent studies on rural finance include (i) declining outreach, (ii) unsustainable credit delivery \ninstitutions, and (iii) high transaction and risk costs. An Advisory Committee on the Flow of Credit \nto Agriculture and Related Activities from the Banking Sector recently examined some of these \nissues, and its recommendations are being finalized.6 In view of weaknesses in the delivery of \ncredit by the formal sector, informal private suppliers play an important role by providing not only \naccess to credit without collateral (especially to small and marginal farmers, and in inaccessible \nareas), but also services, transport, and other logistical support.  \n \n6.  The agribusiness sector is affected by a number of policies and laws\u2014including those \nrelating  to  agricultural  marketing,  storage,  rural  credit,  international  trade,  taxes,  transport  of \nagricultural commodities, cooperatives, food processing, and food safety. The Government has \nreviewed existing policies, and recommended legal reforms to free marketing and processing of \nagricultural  commodities  from  controls  under  the  existing  Agricultural  Produce  Marketing \n(Regulation) Act (APMC Act). A Model Act, the (name of state) Agricultural Produce Marketing \n(Development & Regulation) Act, September 2003 was drafted, to (i) enable nationwide integration \nof agricultural markets, (ii) facilitate emergence of competitive agricultural markets in the private \nand cooperative sectors, (iii) create a conducive environment for large investments in marketing-\nrelated infrastructure, and (iv) lead to modernization and strengthening of existing markets. So far, \n10 states have initiated legal or administrative action for direct marketing and contract farming \narrangements in line with the Model Act. \n \n7.  The agribusiness sector is estimated to account for at least 10% of India\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct. The manufacturing component of the agribusiness sector in India is characterized by the \nsignificant presence of small household production units: unorganized, small players (handling less \nthan 0.5 ton per day) process more than 75% of the industry output in terms of volume and 50% in \nterms of value. For this, as well as the fact that trading services are usually labor-intensive, the \nagribusiness sector is likely to employ a significant fraction of the country\u2019s workforce.7 The growth \nof the agribusiness sector is positively affected by agricultural productivity, changes in consumption \n                                                 \n5  For example, (i) Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 2002.

New Delhi. \n6  ADB is also processing a loan in 2004, based on ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Rural \nFinance Sector Restructuring and Development Program. Manila. \n7  Studies have shown that the labor share of value added in agro-industry is 48% compared with 35% in other \nindustries; and that food-related agro-industries are relatively more labor-intensive.  ", "      3\npatterns away from food staples, improvements in transport and communication infrastructure, \ninternational trade, and supportive government policy. For example, expansion of the rural roads \nnetwork gives improved access to markets. In India, components of commercial agriculture such as \nfruits and vegetables, and oilseeds and sugars are growing faster than food grains. Such supply \nbehavior has its counterpart in consumption pattern changes, with a more rapid growth in the \nconsumption of items such as fruits and vegetables, oils and milk products rather than food grains. \nIn the future, international trade may reinforce these trends. \n \n8.  Horticultural  products  include  fresh,  frozen,  and  processed  fruit  and  vegetables,  and \nproducts such as medicinal herbs and cut flowers. The Government recognizes horticulture as an \nimportant way to diversify agriculture and create employment opportunities. Horticulture production \nis seen to have a comparative advantage because of favorable agroclimatic conditions, low labor \ncosts,  and  seasonality.  It  also  provides  the  rural  poor  with  opportunities  to  increase  skills, \nemployment, and incomes. However, because the produce is perishable and seasonal, it has high \ntechnological  and  managerial  requirements.  An  integrated,  demand-oriented  production  and \nmarketing system, supported by cold chain infrastructure and technical inputs, is needed to realize \nthe potential benefits of horticultural production. To make the environment conducive to private \ninvestment, government action may be required to overcome market failures, reduce unduly high \ntransaction costs, and provide support to a nascent industry. For example, building certification \ncapacity to comply with market grades and standards has public goods aspects. High investment \ncosts for postharvest and transport infrastructure may need public sector financing or cofinancing, \nwith private sector management and maintenance responsibilities. \n \n9.  Contract farming\u2014a forward agreement between growers and processing and marketing \nenterprises\u2014can  provide  the  necessary  backward  and  forward  market  linkages  for  profitable \nsmallholder production. It has been used in India for cash crops (basmati rice, cotton, sugar), as \nwell as fruits and vegetables, and dairy. Well-managed and regulated contract farming will allow \nsmall farmers to participate in and benefit from commercial agriculture. The arrangements provide \nfarmers improved access to production services, credit, and new technology. Contract farming \nrequires a long-term commitment from both farmers and firms, and often involves trial-and-error \nlearning. Experience has shown that incentive structures between partners (particularly growers \nand agribusinesses) must be designed to minimize enforcement problems. The Government can \nfacilitate contract farming arrangements by promoting the development of growers' associations, \nestablishing appropriate contract regulation frameworks, and providing the required infrastructure.  \n \n10.  Agricultural workers, small and marginal farmers, and casual workers engaged in non- \nagricultural  activities  constitute  the  majority  of  the  rural  poor.  Small  landholdings  and  low \nproductivity are the main causes of poverty among the rural population that depends mainly on \nagriculture for livelihood. Although India has made progress in poverty reduction, with a decline in \nnumbers of the poor, regional disparities remain. Rural-urban and gender disparities continue to \nexist between and within states. An initial poverty and social analysis was conducted (Appendix 3). \nIt will be important to consider the range of farmer, input provider, or processor arrangements \nappropriate in each state and identify those that can optimize returns and reduce risks for small \nand marginal farmers.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA will assist the Government in designing an investment project suitable for external \nfinancing that will focus on enhancing income and employment opportunities through increased \nand  sustainable  commercialization  of  agriculture  and  development  of  agribusiness.  The \ninvestments  will  promote  production,  processing,  and  marketing  of  high-value  crops,  and  the \n ", "4 \nbuilding of capacity of all stakeholders so as to support and sustain the process. The TA will design \na project that will assist economically and financially viable investments in market facilities and \ninfrastructure,  as  well  as  support  services  for  agribusiness  development  and  commercialized \nfarming. The project will encourage private sector investment in all stages of the value chain in \nagriculture.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will short-list and evaluate investment options in five states, and prepare project \ncomponents for each state.8 A modular design approach will enable scaling up and replication. The \nproject will contribute to (i) greater efficiency in agribusiness through enhanced value added in \nprocessing and reduced postharvest losses; (ii) demand-driven and private sector-led production \nand processing for national and international markets; and (iii) higher incomes for farmers and \nthroughout  the  marketing  chain.  The  TA  will  draw  on  the  outputs  of  a  recently  completed \nagribusiness sector assessment (footnote 2), and other relevant TA.9 The strategic approach and \ninitial identification of investment needs documented by the assessment will be a basis for further \nprioritizing and selecting investment proposals with the greatest potential for profitable, private \nsector-led growth. The TA will undertake a detailed analysis of constraints and opportunities at the \nstate level, to identify subsectors and commodities with rapid growth potential. Identification of \npossible project components will be based on factors including (i) market analysis, (ii) supply chain, \n(iii) competitive advantage, (iv) potential profitability, (v) extent of postharvest losses, and (vi) \npotential number of farmers benefited.  \n \n13.  Steps will be identified, at the state level, to remove legal impediments to investments in the \nsupply  chain.  Measures  required  to  facilitate  and  assist  markets,  institutions,  standards  and \ninfrastructure in the agribusiness sector will also be detailed. Lessons learned from documented \nexperiences in contract farming will be taken into account in project design and implementation. An \noption to consider is to organize farmers through self-help groups, growers' associations, and \ncooperatives. Existing experiences and contracts will be reviewed, and recommendations will be \nmade on an appropriate framework and dispute resolution mechanism.  \n \n14.  To  contribute  to  rural  and  small  farmer  development,  agribusiness  growth  calls  for \ninnovative  models  of  organization.  The  experience  with  several  models  (cooperative,  public, \nprivate, and public-private partnership) will be reviewed and evaluated, with reference to key \nsuccess factors: (i) creating incentives for farmers to produce the required quantity and quality of \nraw materials, and to supply the produce as per contractual arrangements; (ii) providing required \nfarm inputs and technology, and clarifying who bears what costs and risks; (iii) access to efficient \nand cost-effective processing technology; (iv) providing effective market intelligence to assess \nchanging consumer demand; (v)  attracting investment capital; and (vi) attending to issues of \nownership, organization, management, and quality control. Based on the evaluation, appropriate \nmodels will be formulated for agribusiness development in the project area.  \n \n                                                 \n8  The  five  states  may  be  prioritized  for  interventions  under  the  ensuing  loan  depending  among  others,  on  the \ncommitment to initiate complementary reforms and institutional capacity to support the ensuing project. Depending on \nthe results of the initial analysis under the TA, two or three states may be identified for initial interventions upon \napproval of the proposed project, with the others to follow in a phased manner during the project's implementation. \n9  ADB. 2003.

See footnote 6. ", "      5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,250,000  equivalent,  comprising  $565,000  in  foreign \nexchange  and  $685,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$435,000 equivalent of the local currency cost will be financed on a grant basis by the Government \nof the United Kingdom, and administered by ADB. The Government will contribute the balance of \nthe local currency cost of $250,000 equivalent through the provision of counterpart staff, office \nspace, administrative services, and data. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are given \nin Appendix 4. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC) of the Ministry of Agriculture will be \nthe  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  while  the  National  Cooperative  Development  Corporation \n(NCDC) will be the Implementing Agency at the central level (Appendix 2). Each state will nominate \na nodal department and a project director to work closely with the consultants\u2019 team, facilitate their \ninteractions with other state government agencies, facilitate access to data and information from \nother government departments and organizations, and assist in arranging field visits. Steering \ncommittees will be established at the central and state levels, chaired by the secretary of DAC and \nthe  chief  secretaries  of  respective  states.  A  central  coordination  committee,  chaired  by  the \nmanaging director of NCDC, will oversee TA implementation. The Government assured that (i) a \nproject director will be nominated in each state prior to TA contract negotiations; (ii) furnished office \nspace, utilities, and local communication facilities will be provided for the TA team at Delhi in the \nNCDC premises; (iii) similar facilities will be provided for the TA team in each state capital; (iv) \nassistance will be provided for surveys, stakeholder workshops, and field visits; and (v) assistance \nwill be provided for local transportation. \n \n17.  About 60 person-months of consulting services (20 international and 40  domestic) will be \nrequired.  International  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  agribusiness,  project  economics, \nhorticulture  industry,  agricultural  marketing,  social  development,  and  environmental  analysis. \nDomestic consultants will have expertise in institutional development, legal aspects, business \ndevelopment services, agricultural economics, horticulture development, financial analysis and \nmanagement, social analysis, and environmental assessment. ADB will recruit an international \nconsulting firm (or consortium) in association with domestic consultants, in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for engaging domestic consultants \nsatisfactory to ADB. Consultants will be selected using the simplified technical proposal procedure. \nOutline terms of reference are in Appendix 5. \n \n18.  The TA will start in November 2004 and be completed in June 2005. The following reports \nwill be produced: (i) an inception report at the end of 3 weeks of the TA, (ii) an interim report at the \nend of 2.5 months, (iii) a second interim report at the end of 4.5 months, (iv) a draft final report, at \nthe end of 6 months, and (iv) a final report incorporating feedback and comments. The TA will \nprovide equipment that the consultant will purchase in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Equipment to be procured under the TA will be handed over to DAC upon TA \ncompletion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for preparing the \nAgribusiness Development Support Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK a \n \nPerformance \nMonitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators and \nMechanisms   \nTargets \nGoal       \nRaise rural employment  Rural poverty reduced by  Central Statistical \nand incomes, and reduce  10 percentage points by  Organization (CSO) annual \nrural poverty in the project  end of 11th Five-Year Plan  survey of industries \narea  (2012)   \n    National Accounts Statistics \nEmployment in agro- (NAS) \nbased industries   \nincreased by 5 percentage  National Sample Survey \npoints by 2012  Organization household \n  surveys \nPurpose       \nDiversify agricultural  Value addition in  NAS  An enabling policy, legal and \nproduction and enhance  agriculture raised (above    regulatory environment \nvalue added in the  20% by 2010).

The  Government,  through  the  Interministerial  Task  Force  on  Agricultural  Marketing \nReforms, 2002, has estimated an investment requirement of Rs122.3 billion (about $2.7 billion) \nfor infrastructure development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan period, a major proportion of \nwhich will have to come from private investment. In the case of fresh produce, infrastructure is \nneeded  in  the  form  of  collection  centers,  packing  houses  with  pre-cooling  facilities,  and \ntransportation  under  controlled  conditions.  In  addition,  systems  need  to  be  developed  for \npostharvest  management  and  logistics\u2014including  grading,  standardization  and  quality \ncertification of agricultural produce\u2014at the farm and market levels to improve efficiency and \ncompetitiveness, and provide greater transparency in pricing to help the farmer get a higher \nvalue for his produce. Many laws and regulations govern agribusiness, and a large number of \nagencies  are  involved,  making  private  investment  difficult.  The  continuance  of  restrictive \nlegislation,  such  as  the  existing  Agricultural  Produce  Marketing  (Regulation)  Act  and  the \nEssential Commodities Act, also deters private investment. A complex and burdensome tax \nregime is a further constraint. Ongoing reforms recognize the need to enable the private and \ncooperative sectors to participate in agricultural marketing. \n \n2.  The Government's economic objectives emphasize generating gainful employment in \nagriculture. The annual budget presented in July 2004 underscores that growth will be sustained \namong others by increased production and value addition in agriculture. It notes the need for \nlarge investments in agriculture, but emphasizes that these have to be through credit-enabled \nprivate investment as well as enhanced public investment. To encourage diversification into \nhorticultural  production,  a  National  Horticulture  Mission  is  to  be  launched  with  the  aim  of \ndoubling  horticulture  production  by  2011\u20132012.  Raising  agricultural  growth  through \ndiversification and development of agroprocessing is also stressed.  \n \n3.  Five states were identified for an initial assessment of agribusiness and commercial \nagriculture  investment  constraints  and  opportunities:1  (i)  Chhattisgarh  in  central  India;  (ii) \nHimachal  Pradesh  (HP)  in  the  western  Himalayas;  (iii)  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (J&K),  the \nnorthernmost state in India; (iv) Punjab in northwestern India; and (v) Sikkim in the eastern \nHimalayas. The considerations for selecting these states were as follows: \n \n(i)  Planned ADB assistance to Chhattisgarh for development of irrigation and rural \nroads will support and have synergy with diversification of agriculture. \n(ii)  J&K  has  been  given  high  priority  by  the  Government,  and  appears  to  have \ncomparative advantage for certain horticulture crops. \n(iii)  Punjab has been at the forefront of the green revolution, and is now trying to shift \nfrom agriculture to agribusiness. The need for crop diversification is in part driven \nby soil degradation and depleting water resources from the rapid rotation of rice \nand wheat crops. Initiatives in the state can be considered for replication and \nexpansion in other states. \n(iv)  Sikkim  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  to  support  development  of  the \nnortheastern states. \n(v)  HP has potential in horticulture similar to that of J&K and Sikkim, and was included \nat the Government\u2019s request. \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for the Agribusiness and Commercial Agriculture \nAssessment. Manila. \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \n4.  These  five  states  represent  a  diverse  spread  of  agricultural  development  and  agri-\necological potential. Their key features are outlined in para. 5-9. After stakeholder consultations \nat the central and state levels, broad investment priorities were identified for each state.  \n \n5.  Chhattisgarh has three agroclimatic zones\u2014the northern hills, suitable for horticultural \nproduction; the central flatlands, where monocropping of rice predominates; and the Bastar \nplateau, with a large tribal population dependent on forest produce, in the south\u2014and a diversity \nof produce. The state has one airport and only 9 of 16 district headquarters are linked by rail. \nAlthough  Chhattisgarh  is  a  rice-surplus  state,  it  is  relatively  backward  in  agriculture \ndevelopment. Cropping intensity is only 113% (compared with 183% in Punjab). Irrigation is \nlimited, and agriculture is largely rain-fed. The state, however, started a crop diversification \nprogram in 2000\u20132001, and made a beginning in introducing pulses, oilseeds, and horticultural \ncrops. Proposed ADB assistance for water resource management will support further crop \ndiversification.2 Banana is an important fruit crop, and a private sector tissue culture facility has \ndeveloped a significant capacity to produce banana plants. However, production costs are high, \neven though yields are considerably higher, and small farmers usually lack the capacity to \ninvest in better plantation. Mushroom cultivation is also being taken up in the state; although on \na  small-scale,  it  can  meet  the  nutritional  and  income-generating  needs  of  small  farmer \nhouseholds. Modernization of wholesale markets is a longer-term need, in particular to provide \ncommon facilities for cleaning, grading, and storing grain and oilseeds. Primary processing \ncenters, including packing houses, will be needed to support expansion of banana cultivation. \n \n6.  HP is a leading state in growing temperate fruits, second only to J&K, with an area of \nover 0.2 million hectares under fruit cultivation, and a total production of almost 0.5 million tons \nannually.  Apple  cultivation  has  made  progress,  with  production  of  over  0.3  million  tons. \nHowever, public sector apple juice processing units have not been very successful, and a cold \nchain is still lacking. The state is also a major producer of off-season vegetables, and supplies \nother parts of the country during the summer months (April to September). Potato is a major \ncash crop, with cultivation of seed potato in the higher hills, and contract farming for processing \nin the low hills. National agriculture research centers for potatoes and mushrooms are located in \nHP. The hilly terrain in most of the state limits road connectivity. As in other states, there is a \nneed for primary processing centers in the production areas. There is also a need for modern \npacking houses and controlled atmosphere storage and transportation for apples at strategic \nlocations in the state. A longer-term need also exists for renewing the root-stock for apple, and a \ntechnical assistance project recently started in HP (and Uttaranchal) funded by the FAO will look \nat establishing some pilot sites over the next 18 months. \n \n7.  J&K  has  three  distinct  regions:  the  Jammu  plateau  with  a  subtropical  climate,  the \nKashmir valley, and the Ladakh high-altitude desert. The state is the largest producer of almost \nall  temperate  crops  grown  in  India.  Its  most  important  crops  are  apples  (0.9  million  tons \nannually), walnuts (over 32,000 tons, 90% of India\u2019s annual production), and saffron. Other fruit \ncrops are almonds, apricots, cherries, and pears. A World Bank-assisted project in the early \n1980s had helped to establish apple processing facilities, including cold stores, in the public \nsector. However, during the past 15 years of conflict, the cold stores were abandoned and \nbecame unusable. More recently, an apple juice concentrate plant was established by the \nprivate  sector  near  the  Srinagar  airport  (some  distance  away  from  the  producing  areas). \nDeclining prices of apple juice concentrate in the world market adversely affected the viability of \nthe  export-oriented  unit.

The  state's  distance  from  major \nconsuming  centers,  the  lack  of  infrastructure  for  postharvest  handling  of  fruit,  and  limited \nprocessing facilities prevent growers from realizing their comparative advantage in horticultural \nproduce. \n \n8.  Punjab, which has been at the forefront of the green revolution and has led India in \nachieving its goal of food self-sufficiency, is rapidly becoming a victim of its own success. With \njust 2.4% of India\u2019s arable land, the state produces 21% of India\u2019s wheat and 10% of its rice. \nHowever, the continuing focus on production of wheat and paddy is depleting both groundwater \nand soil fertility. The state realizes the problems, and is implementing a strategy to diversify its \ncropping pattern. An ambitious program was launched to shift about 1 million hectares of land \nfrom paddy and wheat to higher value crops like barley, maize, oilseeds, and horticultural crops, \nas well as higher value basmati rice and durum wheat. Punjab has also developed experiences \nof contract farming, some of which were reviewed under TA 4192-IND (footnote 1); the key \nissue appears to be to \u201cmanage the social interface.\u201d3 The challenge is to get farmers to \nchange, from relatively easy-to-grow cereals with predictable prices, to oilseeds, potatoes, fruits, \nand vegetables that have potentially higher returns but are subject to higher risks. Infrastructure \ninvestments  needed  to  support  the  diversification  program  include  establishing  primary \nprocessing centers in the growing areas for collecting, grading, sorting, packing, and storing  \nproduce.  The  State  Agricultural  Marketing  Board  has  plans  for  improving  the  marketing \ninfrastructure in the state, including establishing a wholesale fruit and vegetable market similar \nto  that  recently  established  by  the  National  Dairy  Development  Board  at  Bangalore.  Bulk \nstorage is also needed for oilseeds. \n \n9.  Sikkim, a mountainous state comprising four districts, is the world's largest producer of \nlarge cardamom, a prized spice. High-value crops with potential for agribusiness development \nare hill ginger, large cardamom, mandarin oranges, and orchids. Most of the produce is sent in \na raw form to other states for value addition through grading and processing. A proposed road \nlink to Tibet via the Nathu La pass (about 25 kilometers from the state capital) could open up \ninternational trade opportunities. Primary processing centers are a possible area for investment, \nparticularly  for  processing  and  packaging  of  ginger  and  cardamom.  It  is  expected  that \ndevelopment and upgrading of road connectivity will provide better market access for higher \nvalue products from the state. The northeastern region of India, including Sikkim, is an area of \nspecial focus for centrally sponsored schemes such as the technology mission on horticulture, \nwhich can support private investment in agribusiness. \n \n10.  The Government has formulated a number of schemes to support the development of \ncommercial  agriculture  and  agribusiness.  These  include  agri-export  zones,  food  parks, \ntechnology mission on horticulture, and technology (agribusiness) incubators. Some of these \nwere reviewed by the recent sector assessment (footnote 1). Proposed investments with ADB \nassistance will complement and leverage funding available under these schemes. \n \n11.  The  National  Cooperative  Development  Corporation  (NCDC)  was  established  as  a \ndevelopment finance institution for the cooperative sector. A major objective of NCDC is to \npromote,  strengthen,  and  develop  the  institution  of  farmers\u2019  cooperatives  for  increasing \nproduction and  productivity,  and  instituting  postharvest  facilities.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nThe Indian economy is an overwhelmingly rural economy with nearly 75% of the population residing in rural areas. \nAgriculture is the mainstay for this economy, with the sector contributing 24.2% to India\u2019s gross domestic product in \n2001\u20132002.  The sector employs 56.7% of the workforce, and provides livelihood to about two thirds of the country\u2019s \npopulation. In 1999\u20132000, 748 of every 1,000 employed women were employed in agriculture and related activities. \nHence the development of this sector has considerable gender implications.  \n \nGiven the high inefficiencies and extremely high postharvest losses, there is a large untapped potential in the \nagribusiness industry, which if developed will have strong multiplier effects on employment, equitable income growth \nthroughout the economy, reduced vulnerability, household food security, higher farm and nonfarm incomes, that can \nlead to poverty reduction. Diversification of Indian agriculture and increased efficiencies in the value chain will \ncontribute to the goal of reducing poverty by raising the productivity of land and water resources in a sustainable \nmanner and augmenting the accrued economies. Private sector participation in such activities can reduce the burden \non central and state finances, and ensure greater efficiency. \n \n \n   \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Poverty Classification: Poverty Intervention a \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nTo the extent that markets facilitate commodity production and integrate producing regions with consuming regions, \nthey help farmers in choosing the most profitable cropping pattern. It must be recognized that small and marginal \nfarmers in poorly integrated areas are especially vulnerable to falling commodity prices because of their inability to \nswitch rapidly to alternatives. An analysis of the project area indicates that measures need to be designed that can \nprotect the livelihoods of the vulnerable groups as well as promote agricultural growth.   \n \n \nC.

Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n  Women in India constitute only about 30% of the workforce, and 90% of women workers are in rural areas. \nPunjab, which is agriculturally developed and among the more prosperous states in the country, registers the lowest \nwork participation rate for women and one of the lowest ratios of women to men. Agriculture continues to be the most \nsignificant area of women\u2019s work participation, whether as workers on household farms owned or tenanted by their \nfamilies, or as wage workers.  Women make 45% of the total agricultural labor force, and 84% of all economically \nactive women are in agriculture. Cultivators constitute only 25% of the women's workforce.   \n \n  Women in agriculture are often significantly underemployed, being engaged in seasonal jobs and for short \ndurations. Their jobs are repetitive, monotonous, and arduous. Gender wage differentials also exist: for example, \nwomen\u2019s wages in rural casual agricultural labor were only 71% of those of men. Recent time-use surveys show that a \nsubstantial amount of women\u2019s time is devoted to unpaid labor, and that this has been increasing over the past \ndecade.          \n \na  Following the Board approval of the R-Paper, Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 83 of the \nR-Paper. \n \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n \n              However, there are also examples of women entrepreneurs in commercial agriculture, and of increased \nopportunities for women to earn income through related activities.

The five states may be prioritized for interventions under the ensuing loan depending among \nothers, on the commitment to initiate complementary reforms and institutional capacity to support the \nensuing project. Depending on the results of the initial analysis under the TA, two or three states may \nbe identified for initial interventions upon approval of the proposed project, with the others to follow in \na phased manner during the project's implementation. Specific tasks (para. 4\u20139) are grouped in the \nareas of analyses that will be required. \n \nA.  Institutional and Legal Aspects \n4.  The following tasks will primarily be based on the study of documents and reports, focus group \ndiscussions with stakeholders and external experts, and review of institutional and regulatory aspects \nfrom case studies of recent and ongoing initiatives in agribusiness. \n \n(i)  Review  relevant  legislation  and  regulations  at  the  central  and  state  levels.

Describe  strategies  for  institutional \nstrengthening, particularly in respect of policy support, human resource development, \nand supply of input and services.  \n(iii)  Assess the extent to which private sector organizations and NGOs have helped develop \nagribusiness, and their functions and effectiveness. \n(iv)  Review experiences of contract farming, and identify success factors for design of such \narrangements. Recommend means of organizing the private agribusiness sector, with \nemphasis on small-scale farmers, to enable industry organizations to ensure agricultural \nproduct  quality  control.  Given  the  mixed  experiences  in  contract  farming,  such \narrangements should be designed to ensure that marginal farmers are not exploited. \n(v)  Indicate mechanisms that allow for partnership between government agencies and the \nprivate sector in development activities.  \n(vi)  Identify needs for training and for consultant and NGO/community-based organization \nsupport, including detailed terms of reference. \n ", "16  Appendix 5 \n(vii)  Examine  the  possibility  of  designing  state-level  projects  that  address  local  gaps  in \nagribusiness  systems and,  at  the  same  time,  help integrate  local  agribusiness  into \nnational and export systems. \n(viii)  In consultation with stakeholders and government agencies, recommend implementation \narrangements (including an implementation schedule) for the proposed project, and \ndelineate the respective roles and responsibilities of the private and public sector, and \nNGOs in project implementation. \n \nB.  Agribusiness Aspects \n5.  Taking note of assessments in TA 4192 (footnote 3) the consultants will do the following: \n \n(i)  Rapidly assess the agribusiness sector in the selected states, from input distribution and \nproduction to processing, handling, marketing, and exports, to identify subsectors with \nthe greatest potential for growth. Document specific issues and constraints (including \ngender-based constraints) in each subsector, and recommend remedial measures. \n(ii)  Review central and state government development strategies and plans pertaining to \nagribusiness and horticulture, and determine how they affect agribusiness development. \n(iii)  Identify key constraints on adoption of new technology by farmers (women and men), \nprocessors, and marketers; and the responsiveness of each group to new technology, \nincluding information and communications technology. \n(iv)  Based on the technical, financial, and marketing assessments, select priority subsectors \nfor intervention, and recommend specific, detailed development strategies for each. \n(v)  Recommend  interventions  to  modernize  the  handling,  processing,  storage,  and \ntransportation of selected commodities. \n(vi)  Determine  the  need  to  strengthen  management  support  including  enterprise \ndevelopment needs to the private sector. Assess the effectiveness and applicability of \nthe technology incubator scheme for agribusiness. \n \nC.  Marketing-Related Aspects \n6.  A supply and demand analysis in the context of overall market conditions will be required. The \nfocus will be to identify market and institutional failures, underperformance and gaps in farm and \nnonfarm production and marketing, and needs for improving incentives, institutions, and infrastructure. \nSituation,  problem,  and  need  analyses  will  be  prepared  for  on-farm  and  nonfarm  enterprise \nproduction, marketing, and transactions. Any issues specific to market access by women for their \nproducts will be identified. \n \n(i)  Assess supply-side issues in terms of (a) physical factors; (b) resource access and costs; \n(c) access to technology; (d) price, quality, timing of outputs, procurement arrangements; \n(e) taxes and subsidies; (f) legal requirements and trade barriers; (g) industry structure \nand transaction costs; and (h) financial and economic performance. \n(ii)  Assess demand-side issues in terms of (a) consumer analysis, at the aggregate and \nsegment levels; (b) supply chain, storage, and marketing costs; (c) collaborators and \nsuppliers;  (d)  consumer  and  buyer  concerns,  especially  export  markets;  and  (e) \ncompetitor analysis for differentiated and export products.5 \n                                                 \n5  There are two sources of consumption expenditure data in India: the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) \nsurveys and National Accounts Statistics (NAS).

Recommend \nmeasures  to  enable  agribusinesses  to  qualify  for  certification  under  internationally \naccepted quality control programs. \n \nD.  Economic and Financial Aspects \n7.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  will  be  prepared  and  presented    in  accordance  with \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nAsian Development Bank, Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Handbook for Integrating \nPoverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects, and Handbook for Integrating Risk \nAnalysis in the Economic Analysis of Projects. The consultants will do the following: \n \n(i)  Using the domestic resource cost approach, determine the comparative advantage of the \ndifferent crops and agricultural commodities that have growth potential in domestic and \nexport markets. \n(ii)  On the basis of comparative advantage analysis and agronomic and social conditions, \nidentify the subsectors and commodities that the proposed project should focus on in the \nselected states to realize the greatest benefits to the largest number of farmers, the \nagribusiness sector, and the national economy. \n(iii)  Identify  the  constraints  on  farmers\u2019  and  enterprises\u2019  access  to  credit,  and  examine \nmechanisms to overcome them. \n(iv)  Prepare detailed cost estimates for the Project using the Costab computer software, and \nmodel farm enterprise budgets using the Farmod computer software. In addition to farm \nproducers, financial analysis will also be undertaken for processors, agribusinesses, and \nmarketing agents to assess the likely incentive structure for these stakeholders.  \n(v)  Provide detailed economic and financial analyses including estimates of economic and \nfinancial internal rates of return, and sensitivity and risk analyses. \n(vi)  Assess the distribution of project economic benefits among different stakeholders, and \nthe poverty impact ratio. \n \nE.  Poverty and Social Aspects \n8.  A focused poverty and social analysis will be carried out during the project design phase, in \naccordance with ADB's Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis, to assess and highlight ways in \nwhich the eventual project might best address poverty reduction and social development issues in the \nproject area. An in-depth analysis will allow prediction of likely outcomes for different groups in the \nproject area. It will also help establish an effective participatory process and prepare specific design \nmeasures. ADB policies and guidelines on indigenous peoples and involuntary resettlement will be \nfollowed  in  the  analysis  and  design.  Field  investigations\u2014surveys,  participatory  workshops  with \nfarmers and other stakeholders, and focus group discussions\u2014will contribute to the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Confirm the dimensions of poverty and vulnerability, and the expected direct and indirect \ncontribution of the project to poverty reduction. Identify the people likely to be affected \neither positively or negatively, and identify barriers and constraints, demand problems, \ninstitutional  weaknesses,  absorptive  capacity  constraints,  gender  gaps,  sustainability \nissues, and other social and institutional risks. \n(ii)  Identify risks and their human and financial costs, and measures that may turn these risks \ninto  opportunities.  Identify  measures  that  will  contribute  to  maximizing  the  poverty \nreduction and social development outcomes of the project. \n ", "18  Appendix 5 \n(iii)  Progressively incorporate the findings of the analysis into the design process, in parallel \nwith the findings of the technical and economic analyses. This will include defining (a) \nsocial development objectives, (b) effective mainstreaming and targeting mechanisms, (c) \naffordable and accessible services that meet specific needs, (d) strategies to address the \nabsorptive capacity of beneficiaries and implementation arrangements, and (e) mitigation \nplans to address social risks and vulnerability. \n(iv)  Identify  project  beneficiaries  by  income  groups,  and  assess  the  likely  distribution  of \nproject benefits among the various groups. \n(v)  Based on the large labor absorption potential of agribusiness development, make a \nquantitative and qualitative assessment of labor market implications, potential for and \neffects  of  reduction  in  underemployment,  and  gender-disaggregated  implications  for \nemployment. \n(vi)  Prepare  a  gender  plan  to  identify  strategies,  mechanisms,  and  components  for \naddressing gender concerns. Use ADB\u2019s Gender Checklist for Agriculture to identify key \nissues and strategies for gender mainstreaming in project design. \n(vii)  Analyze  how  agribusiness  development  in  the  selected  states  will  contribute  toward \nreducing interregional disparities in poverty within the country. \n(viii)  Assess any potential impacts on indigenous or vulnerable populations, particularly tribal \npopulations in Chhattisgarh, and prepare an indigenous people\u2019s plan in accordance with \nADB policy, if impacts are significant. \n(ix)  Prepare a summary poverty reduction and social strategy to be implemented as part of \nthe project. \n \nF.  Environmental Aspects \n9.  Environmental  sustainability  issues  vary  greatly  among  the  five  states,  and  the  different \nenvironmental conditions will need to be assessed. An initial environmental examination (IEE) will be \nprepared in accordance with ADB's Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Agricultural and Natural Resources Development Projects and keeping in \nview relevant guidelines and regulations of the central and state governments. The IEE will involve the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Review  the  environmental  impact  of  crop  production  systems  and  agroprocessing \nenterprises to identify practices detrimental to the environment. \n(ii)  Evaluate the extent and impact of project activities, recommend mitigation measures \nand monitoring programs\u2014taking into account implementation capacity\u2014and estimate \ntheir share in the total project cost. \n(iii)  Specify  the  institutional  arrangements,  necessary  capacity,  and  the  process  of \nenvironmental assessment of project elements during implementation.  \n(iv)  Develop environmental guidelines and criteria to identify environmental implications of \nselected project elements. \n(v)  Review possible indirect or cumulative environmental impacts that may be generated \nby the Project, keeping in view that policy reform may produce positive or negative \nenvironmental impacts. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041020104215+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041012025729Z", "Title": "Microsoft Word - TA 37091-final.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "jda", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)"}}
