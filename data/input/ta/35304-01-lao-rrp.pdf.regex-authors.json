Subprogram 2 is to be \nprovided  as  a  single  tranche,  based  on  completed  prior  actions \ndemonstrating satisfactory progress.  \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management \nThemes (subthemes): Private sector development (policy reforms), \ngovernance (economic and financial governance), economic growth \n(promoting macroeconomic stability) \nLocation impact: National (low impact) \n   \nEnvironment  Category C       \nAssessment \n   \nThe Program  The core objective of the Government\u2019s Sixth National Socio-Economic \nRationale  Development  Plan  (SEDP6)  2006\u20132010  is  sustaining  high  rates  of \neconomic growth (about 7%\u20138% per annum) with poverty reduction. \nThe SEDP6 targets a poverty incidence rate of 23% by 2015 as well as \nthe creation of 652,000 productive jobs from 2006 to 2010. Private \nsector expansion is considered a key mechanism for achieving these \nobjectives. Poverty rates have declined in the Lao PDR in the past two \ndecades from 46% in 1992 to 33% in 2003, and estimated at 28% in \n2008.  This  reduction  has  been  remarkable,  considering  the  rapid \npopulation growth during this period\u2014with as much as 50% of the \npopulation  now  under  the  age  of  20  years.  It  has  been  driven  by \neconomic expansion, opening up the economy to trade and investment, \nan increase in rice production, greater urbanization, and an increase in \nremittances from Laotian workers abroad. It is common to see a sharp \nreduction  in  poverty  once  a  country  passes  a  per  capita  income \nthreshold, as Lao PDR has done. Achieving a further reduction in the \npoverty rate, of a similar magnitude as the SEDP6 target, will depend \non sustaining economic growth at the current rate of 7% per annum \nover  the  medium  term  and  mobilizing  additional  fiscal  resources  to \nsupport long-term development and social spending objectives. The \nLao PDR has the potential to accomplish these goals and the private \nsector will be increasingly relied on to accomplish them.  \nThe ADB country strategy and program (CSP) for 2007\u20132011 identifies \nprivate sector development as a key priority. It has set expansion of \nformal private sector firms by 15% per annum as an outcome indicator \nfor private sector development. Small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs)  are  the  overwhelmingly  dominant  business  form  in  the \n ", "ii   \n \nLao PDR, and sound policy suggests that SMEs should be treated as \nthe private sector norm and not the exception. This suggests that the \nreform  agenda  should  be  broad-based,  focusing  on  reducing  the \ntransaction costs of doing business and improving predictability in the \ninvestment  climate.  Reforms  supporting  institutional  development  in \nSME  policy  formulation,  access  to  finance,  strengthening  the \ninvestment climate, and completing the unfinished trade policy regime \nare crucially important for reducing transaction costs and expanding the \nprivate sector, putting economic growth on a more sustainable path, \nand contributing to poverty reduction. \nThese  measures  are  taking  place  in  the  context  of  a  collapse  in \ncommodity prices and severe recession in major export markets. While \nmuch of the Government\u2019s current focus is on addressing exigencies \narising from the crisis and related fiscal situation, it sees the crisis as an \nopportunity to build consensus among stakeholders on difficult policy \nreform issues and to advance its medium-term objectives related to \nprivate sector/SME development\u2014recognizing that these reforms are \nfundamental  to  supporting  higher  economic  growth  rates,  lessening \nreliance  on  the  resource  sector  for  income  creation,  and  reducing \nunemployment and poverty reduction. \nUnder subprogram 1, the Government implemented a series of reform \nmeasures to the investment climate aimed at reducing the cost of doing \nbusiness in the Lao PDR. These included the enactment of the Law on \nEnterprises of 2006, and commencing its implementation, as well as \nmeasures aimed at chipping away at its import and export management \nsystem. The Government is also committed to preparing for World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) accession talks; this process is influencing the way \nthe  Lao  PDR  views its  business  climate  and  trade  policy  over  the \nmedium  term.  Subprogram  2  builds  on  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram 1, with the core focus on implementing the enterprise law, \nincluding the establishment of the enterprise registry offices, starting a \nprocess  for  regulatory  reform,  advancing  trade  policy  reforms, and \nenhancing capacity and staff training on trade policy formulation. These \nreforms  are  designed  to  accomplish:  (i)  improve  institutional \ncoordination in SME policy formulation and better access to finance,\n(ii) strengthen  investment  climate,  and  (iii)  improve  trade  policy  and \ncapacity development.  \n \nIn response to the global economic crisis, a post-program monitoring \nframework is added at the subprogram 2 phase. The Government and \nADB have agreed to a post-PSME framework in the next 12 months, \ncreating  the  basis  for  continuous  policy  dialogue  and  engagement \nduring  the  critical  period  of  2009\u20132010.  The  monitoring  framework \nfocuses on the Government\u2019s short-term plan advancing its reforms in \nbusiness climate, trade policy, and trade facilitation (a new component) \nsupported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners\u2019  technical  and \nprogram assistance. It may provide the basis for a second-generation \nPSME in the future. \n \n ", "    iii\nThe reform program was prepared by a joint team of representatives of \nthe Government and ADB. \n \nImpact and  The impact of subprogram 2 of the PSME is to achieve sustainable \nOutcome  economic growth in the non-resource sector, supported by increased \ncontribution  of  the  private  sector  and  SMEs.  The  outcome  of \nsubprogram 2 is an improved business environment where the private \nsector and SMEs operate efficiently and effectively.  \n \nThe PSME includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the key \npriorities of the Lao PDR\u2019s Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan \nand its sector strategies. These reforms are designed to accomplish the \nfollowing results.  \n \n(i)  Improve  institutional  coordination  for  SME  policy  and \naccess  to  finance  by  (a)  strengthening  the  institutional \nframework for SME policy formulation; and (b) improving \nSME  access  to  finance  through  improvements  in \naccounting  rules  and  guidelines  and  development  of \nnonbank financial instruments.  \n(ii)  Strengthen  investment  climate  by  (a)  implementing  the \nenterprise  law,  and  (b)  other  policy  reforms  aimed  at \nreducing  transaction  costs  of  doing  business  in  the \nLao PDR;  and  (c)  more  transparency  in  the  regulatory \nenvironment affecting SMEs. \n(iii)  Improve  trade  policy  and  capacity  development  by  (a) \nreforming the import\u2013export management system including \nmaking measures more transparent and over the medium \nterm,  reforming  the  controlled  list  of  imports;  and  (b) \nstrengthening indigenous capacity to carry out trade policy \nanalysis.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A grant of $15,000,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be \nprovided for subprogram 2 of the PSME with terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Grant Agreement. \n   \nPeriod and  The subprogram 2 period is from October 2007 to September 2009, \nTranching  with a single tranche grant of $15 million to be disbursed when the \nGovernment has met the conditions for grant effectiveness.  \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the grant proceeds to meet program expenditures and \nassociated costs of reform and to help maintain current levels of social \nexpenditure. \n   \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC). MOIC will be responsible \nfor coordinating the implementation and sustaining of PSME reform \nactions. \n ", "iv   \n \nImplementation  The  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL),  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the \nArrangements  Ministry  for  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI)  are  the  Implementing \nAgencies  (IAs).  MOIC  will  establish  a  PSME  steering  committee, \nchaired  by  the  minister  of  industry  and  commerce  and  comprising \nsenior officials from BOL, MOF, and MPI. The committee will meet \ntwice a year to monitor progress and oversee implementation of the \nPSME, and to provide guidance and direction to the Executing Agency \n(EA) and IAs.  \n   \nProcurement   The grant proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nProgram Benefits  The program cluster will provide the following benefits. \nand Beneficiaries   \n(i)  Improved  investor  confidence  through  completion  of \nimplementation  of  the  new  enterprise  law  and  a  new \ninvestment law that provides for national treatment. \n(ii)  Lower  transaction  costs  for  business  because  of \nstreamlined business start-up procedures, a reduction in \nred tape, and reform of remaining non-tariff barriers, which \nwill  open  new  opportunities,  increase  investment  and \nproductivity,  boost  the  economy,  and  increase  incomes \nand create jobs, and sustainable reduction in poverty.  \n(iii)  Strengthened  institutional  development  through  raising \ncapabilities  in  the  EA  and  IAs  to  carry  out  trade, \ninvestment,  and  SME  policy  analysis  with  the  aim  of \nimproving the quality of policy, institutional processes for \npolicy making. Posting regulations on the SME Promotion \nand  Development  Office  (SMEPDO)  website  will  also \ncontribute  to  institutional  development  through  better \nregulatory transparency. \n   \nRisks and  The Program is firmly embedded in the SEDP6, the Government\u2019s new \nAssumptions  SME strategy, and ongoing business climate reforms. The assumptions \nunderlying the Program include the following:   \n \n(i)  Macroeconomic stability is maintained. \n(ii)  The Government will stay on course with key business \nregulatory reform measures. \n(iii)  The Government stays on track with its preparations for \nWTO accession. \n \nHowever, there are risks to the Program: \n \n(i)  In  transitional  economies,  maintaining  macroeconomic \nstability\u2013\u2013reflected in low inflation and a stable exchange \nrate\u2013\u2013is critical for investor confidence and private sector \ngrowth.  The  Lao  PDR  is  particularly  vulnerable  to \nmacroeconomic instability because of weak institutions. It \nalso  faces  emerging  fiscal  stress  and  macroeconomic \n ", "    v\nchallenges in the context of the fall in resource revenues, \nwhich  threaten  to  undermine  recent  gains  in  social \nspending  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Government \nrecognizes  these  risks  and  is  undertaking  measures  to \nraise  revenue  and  strengthen  public  expenditure \nmanagement, with the assistance of development partners \nincluding ADB.  \n(ii)  The capacity of agencies to implement reforms may be \nconstrained  by  resources  and  other  emerging  priorities. \nThe PSME reduces this risk by limiting the policy triggers \nto  a  small  number  of  high-priority,  high-impact  policy \nreforms  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  EA  and  a  limited \nnumber of IAs (BOL, MPI, and MOF), and by attaching \ntechnical assistance (TA) to each policy trigger.  \n(iii)  There  will  be  resistance  to  some  of  the  reforms  from \nvested  interests,  including  the  dominance  of  the  state \nenterprise sector in some sectors. Reforms to the import\u2013\nexport  management  system  and  institutionalizing \neconomic  governance  reforms\u2013\u2013i.e.,  red  tape  review \nprocess\u2013\u2013are likely to be a lengthy process. Resistance \nmay  also  come  from  entrenched  cultural  and  political \neconomy factors that may slow market economy reforms \nand  market  competition.  However,  these  risks  are \nmitigated by the following factors: (a) the PSME strategic \napproach  is  to  focus  efforts  on  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s  initiatives,  and  (b) reforms  will  focus  on \nareas where there is political will and some measure of \ncapacity. This has been demonstrated by the successful \nimplementation of the enterprise law and establishment of \nthe enterprise registry, which has resulted in substantial \ncuts in business compliance costs and 5,000 enterprises \nregistering for the first time ever.    \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for subprogram 2 of the Private Sector and \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program (PSME). The program design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  The Global Financial Crisis \n2.  The proposed second subprogram of the PSME comes at a critical moment for the \nLao PDR. It is designed to maintain the momentum of key development efforts at a challenging \ntime of lower commodity prices and a recession last seen in 1998. The impact on the Lao PDR \neconomy of the first round effects of the global financial crisis has been negligible because of \nthe  low  level  of  development  of  the  Lao  PDR  financial  sector  and  limited  exposure  to \ninternational credit markets. The major impact arises from the second round effects of the \ncollapse in commodity prices and recession in major export markets on the real sector and the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal situation. Copper prices, for instance, have fallen by more than half in the \nlast 12 months, significantly affecting revenue flows to the national budget. The Government \nexpects further stress on the fiscal situation in 2010 as tax revenue from the commodity sector \nis expected to drop substantially as corporate losses are carried over. In the real sector, the \nLao PDR economy is also closely linked with the Thai economy, so it is vulnerable to shocks \ntransmitted from Thailand through channels such as extensive border trade, investment, tourism, \nand remittances from overseas workers. Thailand began to experience recessionary conditions \nin the fourth quarter of 2008 and this has clearly had an impact (albeit lagged) on the Lao PDR \nreal sector through a subsequent drop in tourist arrivals and border trade.  \n \n3.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects an economic slowdown in the Lao PDR \nfrom a 7.5% economic growth rate in 2008 to 4.5% in 2009. Also the international consensus is \nthat the global economy may only experience a gradual recovery in 2010 and this will affect Lao \nPDR's economic growth prospects next year. Given constraints on raising budget financing, the \nGovernment has opted not to provide a fiscal stimulus\u2014instead, it will protect and maintain \npublic spending and therefore its poverty reduction goals. With declining resource revenues, the \nGovernment is projecting a budget deficit of about 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009, \nincluding  a  budget  financing shortfall  of  about  $50  million\u2013$60  million.  While much  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s current focus is necessarily on addressing exigencies arising from the crisis and \nrelated fiscal situation, it also views the crisis as an opportunity (i) to build consensus among \nstakeholders on difficult policy reform issues, and (ii) to advance its medium-term objectives \nrelated  to  private  sector  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  development.  It \nrecognizes that these reforms are fundamental to supporting higher economic growth rates, \nlessening reliance on the resource sector for income creation, and reducing unemployment and \npoverty.  \n \nB.  The Government\u2019s Development Strategy \n4.  In  2006,  the  Government  announced  its  Sixth  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP6),1 2006\u20132010,  setting  out  the  country\u2019s  development  priorities, \n                                                 \n1 Committee for Planning and Investment, Government of the Lao PDR. 2006. National Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2006\u20132010. Vientiane. \n ", " 2    \n \npolicy agenda, programs, and projects for the current period. A key pillar of the SEDP6 is to \nachieve higher and more sustainable economic growth and create jobs through private sector \ndevelopment\u2014with  emphasis  on  commercial  agriculture,  rural  development,  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and fostering SMEs. To help implement the SEDP6 priority for private sector \ngrowth, the Government adopted a range of sector-specific strategies, most with a time-bound \nimplementation  plan  and  clearly  defined  ministerial  responsibilities,  some  of  which  are \nsupported by Asian Development Bank (ADB) sector programs and technical assistance (Figure \n1). The SME strategy outlines a road map for longer term development of the sector, including \nregulatory reform and improved access to finance. The Law on Enterprises of 2006 reflects \nreform priorities under the SME strategy and its implementation, and is the responsibility of the \nMinistry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC). MOIC\u2019s trade policy priorities are anchored in its \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) accession efforts, and include reforming its import and export \nmanagement system and trade facilitation (such as enhancing its sanitary and phytosanitary \nregulatory system). The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has a public financial management reform \nprogram with supporting technical assistance (TA) from ADB and other development partners, \nand  includes  the  development  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework,  internal  control \nsystems,  and  accounting  reforms.  The  Government  has  also  drafted  a  financial  sector \ndevelopment strategy (up to 2020), which has been submitted to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office \n(PMO) for approval. The strategy covers development of the banking sector, nonbank financial \ninstitutions, microfinance, the capital market, and financial sector infrastructure.  \n \nC.  The Government and its Development Partners \n5.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  2007\u20132011  for  the  Lao  PDR  identified \nprivate sector development as a key thematic initiative.2 The CSP emphasizes that ADB will \nassist the Government to improve the climate for private sector development through support for \npolicy, institutional, and regulatory reform in sectors in which ADB operates\u2014transforming the \nagriculture  sector  from  subsistence  farming  to  a  commercial  orientation,  improving  basic \ntransport  and  power  infrastructure,  strengthening  the  regulatory  regime  governing  financial \ninstitutions,  restructuring  state-owned  commercial  banks,  improving  investment  regulations, \nfostering SME growth, mobilizing resources and broadening access to financing for private \nsector development, and enhancing the soundness and sustainability of public finance.  \n \n6.  The PSME program operationalizes the CSP by providing support for business climate \nand  trade  reforms  and  related capacity  building  at  the  relevant  agencies.  The program  is \nstructured as a cluster and aims to help the Government achieve its medium- to long-term goals \nof sustained economic growth of 7%\u20138% per annum, expansion of the private sector, and \npoverty reduction. The PSME focuses on three core areas directly affecting private sector \ndevelopment and growth: (i) institutional coordination in SME policy formulation and access to \nfinance,  (ii)  investment  climate,  and  (iii)  trade  policy  and  capacity  development.  Besides \nadvancing  the  policy  reform  agenda,  a  core  objective  of  the  PSME  program  is  capacity \ndevelopment  at  the  relevant  agencies,  and  staff  training  to  undertake  analytical  work  and \nstrengthen policy formulation. The PSME builds on and continues ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with \nthe  Government  in  this  area,  which  has  been  ongoing  since  2004.  This  engagement  has \ncontributed to a number of significant developments in recent years, including formulation of a \nnew enterprise law, its implementing decrees such as the negative list, as well as development \nof the SME strategy.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Key  features  of  the  PSME  include  \n(i) two single tranche operations, with a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the \noutset and including completion of high-impact reforms prior to consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors; (ii) triggers for the subsequent subprogram to support continuity of dialogue with the \nGovernment, development partners, and other stakeholders; and (iii) a limited number of well-\ntargeted policy actions aimed at achieving high-impact outcomes regarding improvement of the \nenabling environment for private sector development. In this way, the Program provides a \n ", " 4    \n \ncoherent medium-term reform strategy with two discrete but linked subprograms and a strong \nemphasis on performance, as the decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram is \ncontingent on overall satisfactory performance of the triggers. It recognizes the necessity for \nflexibility in the reform measures, with provisions for incorporating lessons and responding to \nchanges in the external environment in the design of subprogram 2. \n \n8.  The Program has the following three phases:  \n \n(i)  Subprogram 1. Financed by ADB ($5 million) in 2007, subprogram 1 focused on \nkey legislative reforms to the enterprise registration regime; it began the process \nfor SME policy and institutional strengthening, and trade policy reforms; and \ncreated the basis for continuous policy dialogue and engagement over 2007\u2013\n2009 (subprogram 2).3  \n(ii)  Subprogram 2. The current phase, to be financed by ADB ($15 million), focuses \non implementing business climate reforms and SME institutional development. \nSubprogram 2 supports the Government\u2019s efforts to improve trade policy capacity, \nespecially as the Lao PDR increases its efforts preparing for WTO accession.  \n(iii)  Post-program  monitoring  framework.  In  response  to  the  global  economic \ncrisis,  a  post-program  monitoring  framework  is  a  new  instrument  added  to \nsubprogram 2. The Government and ADB have agreed to a post-PSME  program \nframework  in  the  next  12  months,  creating  the  basis  for  continuous  policy \ndialogue  and  engagement  during  the  critical  period  of  2009\u20132010.  The \nmonitoring framework focuses on the Government\u2019s short-term plan advancing \nits  reforms  in  business  climate,  trade  policy,  and  trade  facilitation  (a  new \ncomponent) supported by ADB and other development partners' technical and \nprogram assistance. It may provide the basis for a second-generation PSME \nprogram in the future. \n \n9.  Government  and  development  partner  coordination.  The  PSME  program  works \nclosely with other development partners\u2014the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID), the European Commission (EC), German development cooperation through GTZ, the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and \nthe World Bank\u2014and stakeholders to provide support to private sector development in the Lao \nPDR  (Appendix  4).  In  particular,  the  EC  is  providing  parallel  financing  for  TA  (\u20ac3 million) \ndesigned to support implementation of the PSME program cluster and to work closely with ADB \nto broaden the private sector and SME reform agenda, and support the Government\u2019s efforts to \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity  for  policy  formulation.  The  ADB  and  EC  teams  are  joint \nmembers of the Government\u2019s SME steering committee, chaired by the minister of industry and \ncommerce, established under the PSME program. Program progress is reported to the steering \ncommittee every semester. ADB also participates in the Lao Business Forum and works with \nthe Mekong Private Sector Facility of the IFC. The forum, established in 2005, comprises \nrepresentatives from the Lao PDR private sector, senior government officials, stakeholders, and \ndevelopment partners. The primary purpose of the forum is as a vehicle to promote ongoing \ndialogue between the private sector, the Government, and other stakeholders on private sector \ndevelopment issues.  \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2007.

In 2008, the Lao PDR economy continued the strong \nexpansion that began in 2005. The economy is estimated to have grown by 7.2% in 2008, which \nis similar to rates achieved in 2006 and 2007 and well above the average growth rate of 6% per \nannum from 1990 to 2004. Table 1 presents data on key indicators over 2004\u20132008 to show the \nimproved macroeconomic performance in recent years. Robust growth in 2008 has occurred \nacross all the major economic sectors\u2014the mining and power sectors, and to a lesser extent \nmanufacturing, were the main engines of growth, followed by services and agriculture. In 2007, \nexports of goods and services increased by 17% to reach $1.3 billion and they are estimated to \nhave grown about 24% in 2008. Tourism also performed well. More than 1.6 million tourists \nvisited  the  Lao  PDR  in  2007,  generating  over  $200  million.  About  1.8 million  visitors  are \nestimated  to  have  visited  the  Lao  PDR  in  2008,  providing  impetus  for  continuation  of  a \nconstruction boom in Vientiane and Luang Prabang, two major tourist destinations. Indicators of \ninvestment goods (such as domestic cement sales, other construction materials, and imports of \ncapital goods) suggest investment growth was strong in 2007 and 2008. Foreign investment in \nthe  non-mining  sector  increased,  with  investments  in  sectors  where  the  Lao  PDR  has  a \ncomparative advantage (tourism and commercial agriculture). \n \n11.  Macroeconomic conditions. The current account in the balance of payments remained \nin deficit at 16% of GDP in 2008, driven by investments in the resource sectors. Grants and \nforeign investment flows lifted gross international reserves in 2007 and the first half of 2008, but \ninternational reserves declined in the second half of 2008 as investment inflows slowed with the \nonset of the global financial crisis. Overall, the import coverage of gross international reserves \nwas 3.4 months at the end of December 2008. Inflation was a problem in the first half of 2008, \nas the surge in international food prices transmitted into domestic inflation\u2014reaching 11% in \nAugust 2008 on a year-on-year basis\u2014but it has since fallen to \u20131.5% in July 2009. Other \nmacroeconomic indicators (such as the public debt\u2013GDP ratio) continue to improve. Estimates \nof the budget outturn for the fiscal year (FY) 2008 indicated revenues slightly surpassing the \nbudget program target and expenditures in line with the budget program, resulting in an overall \nnational government budget deficit of 2.1% of GDP, down from 2.8% (Appendix 5).4  \n \n12.  Remarkable  progress  in  reducing  poverty.  Using  the  national  poverty  line,  the \nincidence of poverty in the Lao PDR has declined from 46% in 1992 to an estimated 28% in \n2008. The reduction in the poverty rate took place as the economy began to recover from the \nAsian financial crisis in the late 1990s, and much of it took place in the poorest parts of the \ncountry. Factors contributing to this remarkable reduction in poverty incidence include sustained \nper  capita  income  expansion,  greater  labor  mobility  between  rural  and  urban  areas  and \nurbanization, higher rice production, private sector expansion, and improvements in market \naccess both domestically and in neighboring countries. The Lao PDR is on track in terms of \nmeeting the income poverty Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  \n \n13.  Impact of global financial crisis on the Lao PDR. The direct and indirect effects of the \nglobal financial crisis on the Lao PDR banking system have been limited, as financial sector \nassets account for less than 15% of GDP, its exposure to international credit markets is limited, \nand the Government does not access international commercial credit markets to finance its \nbudget. The major impact on the Lao PDR economy comes from the second round effects of \n                                                 \n4  Based on the IMF definition of the overall budget balance. The IMF definition differs slightly from the Government\u2019s \ndefinition in that the IMF excludes amortization of debt from the calculation of the budget balance. \n ", " 6    \n \nglobal demand destruction, the collapse in international commodity prices, and their feedback \ninto  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  situation.  In  particular,  the  Lao  PDR  economy  is  linked  to \nThailand\u2019s economy. ADB staff estimates indicate that a 1% decline in Thai economic growth \nwill  result  in  a  1%\u20132%  decline  in  Lao  PDR  economic  growth  in  the  non-resource  sector. \nThailand began to experience recessionary conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the \neconomy contracted by 6% in the first quarter of 2009 on a year-on-year basis. The impact on \nthe Lao PDR real sector has not been immediate; instead, a transmission lag is being observed \nthrough a subsequent drop in tourist arrivals of about 10% in the last 6 months, with spillovers to \ntourism-related sectors and sluggish border trade. Garment exports\u2014mainly to the European \nmarkets\u2014fell in 2008 and are expected to drop significantly from the second quarter of 2009 \nonward. \n14.  With this background, the Government has revised its macroeconomic framework and \nprojects growth of 5.5% in 2009. The IMF projects lower economic growth of 4.5% based on \nfaltering garment exports, a fall in resource revenues, and a slowdown in foreign investment. \nThis translates to a negative output gap of 2.5% of GDP (i.e., actual economic growth is \n2.5 percentage points below the potential economic growth rate, Figure 2e). It is the potential \nfeedback from a slowing real sector to the banking sector that has increased vulnerabilities of \nthe domestic banking sector. While the banking sector is in a better financial situation in 2009 \nthan 3 years ago, the capital asset ratios of the state-owned commercial banks are still low and \nthey remain vulnerable to relatively modest shocks. Banks will be tested through the impact of \nthe crisis on their borrowers, with the number of nonperforming loans expected to rise if the poor \neconomic conditions persist (Appendix 5). \n15.  Feedback to fiscal policy. The global financial crisis has affected fiscal policy in two \nways. First, the collapse in commodity prices, especially copper (the main mineral export), from \nthe third quarter of 2008 has reduced resource revenue flows to the national budget by about \n1% of GDP below budget target. Fiscal stress is expected to increase in 2010 as profit taxes \nfrom  the  resource  sector  shrink  further  on  the  carryover  of  losses  from  FY2009.  Second, \nbecause of constraints in budget financing, the Government is unable to provide for a fiscal \nstimulus; instead, its priority is to maintain public spending. As a result of the shortfalls in \nresource revenues, the Government projects that its budget deficit will rise from the initial target \nof 3.4% of GDP to about 5% in 2009, creating a budget shortfall of $50 million\u2013$60 million. The \ndeficit could be higher if non-resource tax collection falls short of its budget target in 2009. \nBased on the IMF definition of the overall budget balance, the deficit could be as high as 7.9% \n(Appendix  5).  The  fiscal  constraint  is  putting  at  risk  the  recent  gains  in  social  spending, \nespecially in education. \n ", "  7\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic  \n(percentage of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n   \nIndicator   2005  2006  2007  2008 \nReal Sector   \nReal GDP growth (%)  7.1  8.1  7.9  7.2 \nAgriculture  2.5  3.5  6.2  2.0 \nIndustry  15.9  21.5  6.5  10.0 \nServices  6.7  5.3  12.1  9.7 \nMerchandise trade ($ million)a         \nExports     697.0  1,133.0  1,321.0  1,639.0 \nImports  1,270.0  1,589.0  2,156.0  2,816.0 \nInternational visitor arrivals (\u2019000)  1,095.0  1,215.0  1,623.0  1,767.0 \n         \nMonetary Sector         \nAnnual inflation (%, average of period)  7.2  6.8  4.5  7.6 \nAnnual inflation (%, end of year)        8.8  4.7  5.6  3.2 \nBroad money (% annual growth)  8.1  17.2  38.7  18.4 \nExternal public debt (end period)    81.0  63.0  59.1  53.1 \nExternal public debt service ratio      \n  (% of exports)  7.7  5.7  12.5  10.3 \nCurrent account balance      (17.8)  (10.3)  (15.8)  (16.5) \nGross official reserves ($ million)  238.0  336.0  528.0  636 \n         \nPublic Finances         \nNational government overall budget     \nbalance (authorities definition)  (3.0)  (2.9)  (2.0)  (3.4) \nNational government overall budget    (3.3)  (3.1)  (2.8)  (2.1) \n  balance (IMF definition)b \nRevenues and grants  14.5  15.8  15.6  15.9 \n  Tax and nontax revenues   12.4  14.0  14.3  14.5 \n         Of which resources  1.1  2.2  2.7  2.9 \n  Grants  2.0  1.7  1.3  1.5 \nExpenditures  17.4  18.6  17.7  19.3 \n  Current expenditures  9.1  8.9  10.3  11.3 \n  Capital and onlending  7.2  8.1  7.0  7.1 \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s  \nDemocratic Republic. \na  Estimate only. \nb The IMF definition of overall budget balance differs slightly from the Government\u2019s definition in the treatment \nof amortization of debt and other terms.

Issues and Opportunities \n16.  The  private  sector  is  characterized  by  the  dominance  of  micro,  small,  and \nmedium-sized enterprises. The most recent data on firm numbers and size is from the 2006 \nindustrial census carried out by the National Statistics Office (Table 2).5 The census reports \n126,913 enterprises operating in the Lao PDR in 2006, of which 23% are located in Vientiane. \nOnly 2.4% of enterprises have 10 or more employees, of which less than 0.2% (or 198) have \nmore than 100 employees. The bulk of establishments (123,800) are micro- and small-scale \nenterprises with less than 10 workers. Almost two-thirds of enterprises operate in the domestic \ntrade  services  sector,  followed  by  19%  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  This  pattern  of  size \ndistribution in the economy is typical for small, low-income developing economies. In the initial \nstages of development, the private sector is dominated by small-scale enterprises, and as the \neconomy expands, competitive SMEs may grow and add to the pool of larger firms. Findings \nfrom a recent survey of 490 registered establishments in 2007 by GTZ indicate that these \ngrowth dynamics are occurring in the economy.6 The survey found small but still significant \nincreases in the share of large enterprises in terms of the total number of enterprises as well as \nemployment  from  levels  in  2005.  The  majority  of  SMEs  operate  informally,  with  only  an \nestimated 40% holding an enterprise certificate. \n17.  Private  sector  growth  and  development.  Measures  of  productivity  and  trade \nfacilitation costs, as well as large recent investments in infrastructure, suggest that conditions \nfor growth of the Lao PDR economy are improving. This improvement in efficiency of the \neconomy, located beside the two fastest growing economies in the world (the People\u2019s Republic \nof China and Viet Nam), and middle-income Thailand, as well as expected higher budget \nrevenues from the resource sector in the longer term, provide the Lao PDR with tremendous \npotential for private sector growth and development over the longer term. However, attainment \nof this potential is held back by a range of issues that slow economic integration with neighbors, \ndeter  investment,  and  dampen  productivity  growth.  These  include  (i)  a  weak  institutional \nframework for SME policy coordination and access to finance, (ii) high transaction costs and \nunpredictability in the investment regime, and (iii) relatively high costs involved in importing and \nexporting goods (Appendix 6).   \n \n                                                 \n5 Lao PDR, The Steering Committee on Economic Census. 2007.

Need for more coherent approach to policy formulation and implementation. For \nmany developing economies, the problem of coordination failure between the public and private \nsector is a constraint on private sector and SME development. In the Lao PDR, with a large \nnumber of government agencies involved in the formulation of policies and regulations that \naffect the private sector, lack of a systematic, consultative process for formulation of policy and \nregulation  has  provided  scope  for  policy  unpredictability  and  increased  the  likelihood  of \nregulations that unduly hinder private sector development. Decentralization adds a further layer \nof complexity to the business environment for firms, with local governments responsible for a \nrange of regulations that have cost and operational implications. Recent reforms, however, have \nhelped establish the framework for a more coherent approach to private sector development. A \nkey step in this regard was the establishment of the SME Promotion and Development Office \n(SMEPDO) in 2004, providing a focal point for championing reforms aimed at improving the \nenabling environment for SMEs in particular and the private sector more generally. Under \nsubprogram 1 of the PSME, SMEPDO formulated the national strategy for SME development \n(2007\u20142012) in 2007 and is charged with overseeing its effective implementation.7 The strategy \nprovides a comprehensive action plan for assisting SMEs in addressing constraints to growth, \nincluding  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  businesses  to  operate.  The  strategy  was \napproved by the PMO in early 2008 after extensive dialogue and consultation with stakeholders \nin the private sector through the Lao Business Forum, the Lao National Chamber of Commerce \nand Industry, other groups, and development partners. In 2008, SMEPDO established the \nmonitoring unit in response to demand from both internal (SMEPDO) and external stakeholders \nof SMEPDO for transparent information, good management, and delivery of results under the \nstrategy. The first monitoring report was produced in the first quarter of 2009 and notes that, \nwhile implementation was slow at first, it has accelerated in recent months (para 51). \n \n19.  Strengthening  public\u2013private  dialogue.  While  an  institutional  mechanism  exists \n(i.e., Lao Business Forum) to support dialogue between the business community and relevant \nauthorities at the central government level, similar arrangements have been missing at the \nprovincial level although local governments are responsible for the issuance, implementation, \nand/or enforcement of many regulations that impact the private sector. To provide an effective \nchannel for feedback from the private sector on issues facing firms at the provincial level, the \nGovernment (with support from GTZ) has initiated provincial public\u2013private dialogues (P3Ds) in \n                                                 \n7 SMEPDO. 2008. The Lao Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Strategy. Vientiane. \n ", "  11\na number of pilot provinces.8 These are intended to provide a regular forum to bring issues \nfacing firms to the attention of relevant local authorities for resolution at the local level. While the \npiloted P3Ds are in their infancy, they have highlighted common issues facing firms such as skill \nshortages in the workforce, the need for consistent application of taxes, and overly bureaucratic \nprocesses involved in compliance with regulations. While not all issues can be quickly or readily \nresolved, the ability to bring them to the attention of relevant authorities on a regular basis \nthrough a public forum is a significant new development that has the potential to spur more \nresponsive and transparent public administration at the local level. In recognition of their value, \nthe Government is institutionalizing the P3Ds process in the four pilot provinces and plans to \nreplicate it in other provinces going forward. P3Ds, once effectively institutionalized, can also \nserve as a natural mechanism for the conduct of stakeholder consultations under key initiatives \nsupported by the Program such as pilot testing regulatory impact assessments. \n \n20.  Access to finance. The finance sector of the Lao PDR is shallow, with the banking \nsystem constituting the main form of formal financial intermediation. Microfinance institutions are \nexpanding to serve the needs of microenterprises but coverage remains low. Consequently, \nSMEs have had limited access to formal sources of financing, and generally rely on retained \nearnings and informal sources. The 2008 GTZ enterprise survey of 2007 found that 50% of \nentrepreneurs  surveyed  reported  access  to  capital  as  a  major  constraint  to  their  growth \n(footnote 6). The Government, with assistance from ADB through the Banking Sector Reform \nProgram  (BSRP)  completed  in  March  20099 and  the  Rural  Financial  Sector  Development \nProgram (RFSDP)10 on track to be completed in 2011, have helped to restore the health of the \nbanking sector gradually, improving the competitive environment and developing microfinance \ninstitutions. The Lao Development Bank, a state-owned commercial bank, has refocused its \nmarket segment to serving SMEs. \n \n21.  However, SMEs face legal and capacity constraints in accessing finance, and these \nneed to be addressed if SMEs are going to benefit from recent banking sector developments. \nConstraints include weak protection of creditors\u2019 rights, which means that banks largely rely on \nthe use of fixed assets (e.g., land and buildings) as collateral to secure loans, placing SMEs \ngenerally at a disadvantage in accessing credit. The Government is addressing this through \nreforms such as preparation of a draft decree on secured transactions that would provide a \nframework for using a wider range of assets (including movable assets) as collateral for loans. \nAnother critical constraint is limited credit information on customers that allows banks to assess \ncredit risk. Currently, requests by banks for such information are processed by the central \nbank\u2019s Credit Information Bureau (CIB) using an inefficient manual paper-based system\u2014that \ncan often take up to a week to generate responses. Upgrading to a system  based on a \ncentralized database that allows commercial banks to search for and update customer credit \ninformation  in  real  time  could  significantly  reduce  the  time  and  costs  involved  in  credit \nassessment. Another constraint is the limited range of alternative financial products to bank \nloans available to SMEs. Under the BSRP, the Government drafted and submitted a lease \nfinancing decree to the PMO in February 2008 establishing a regulatory framework for the \nleasing industry, with the aim of developing the sector. The decree was approved in July 2009. \nA final constraint is the poor accounting and financial reporting capacity of SMEs, which also \nlimits access to finance. According to the GTZ enterprise survey, 75% of microenterprises, 54% \n                                                 \n8 Champasak, Louangphrabang, Louang-Nam Tha, and Savannakhet. \n9 ADB. 2009.

Under subprogram 1, the Government enacted a new \naccounting  and  auditing  law  and  is  currently  disseminating  information  and  accounting \nstandards to the business community, with assistance from the EC under its SME project.  \n \n2.  Investment Climate   \n \n22.  The Lao PDR has enjoyed sustained investment expansion since 2000. Reforms to the \nbusiness environment since the early 1990s\u2014with the enactment of the Business Law of 1994, \nforeign  and  domestic  investment  laws  in  2004,  the  enterprise  law  of  2006  (replacing  the \nbusiness law), and other commercial legislation\u2014contributed to this expansion. FDI is critical to \ndevelopment of the Lao PDR at its current level of development and with its undeveloped \nfinancial sector. Evidence shows that FDI brings important externalities to local firms, suppliers, \nand workers through technology and skill transfers. Successful entry of FDI breeds success and \nthis attracts additional FDI in other sectors. It is also associated with improved employment and \npoverty reduction. Figure 3 shows a big jump in annual FDI approvals since 2000 across all \nmajor sectors. The composition of this growth has also changed with the increase in the share \nof projects going to agriculture, mining, and hotels\u2014indicative of the Lao PDR\u2019s comparative \nadvantage in tourism and natural resources. While current data are not available, anecdotal \nevidence suggests that this investment has slowed in 2009 because of the global financial crisis \nand collapse in commodity prices.  \n \n  Figure 3: Foreign Direct Investment Approvals \n      (number of projects) \n   \n                 Agriculture \n \n  Industry \n \n  Wood\n  2007 \n  Mining\n2000 \n \n  Hydropower\n \n  Hotel\n \n  Other\n \n  0  10  20 30 40 50 \n \n \n \n              Source: Ministry of Planning and Investment. \n \n23.  Update  on  constraints  on  investment.  The 2008 GTZ enterprise survey of 2007 \nreiterated the key constraints to investment attractiveness in the Lao PDR such as infrastructure \n(mainly roads, water, and electricity supply reliability); excessive red tape; labor skills; taxation; \nand access to finance. The ADB-World Bank investment climate survey carried out in 2005 \nfound that ranking of constraints differed across major sectors.11 Manufacturing firms ranked \ninfrastructure, regulations, and taxation as their top three constraints, while operators in tourism \n                                                 \n11  ADB  and  World  Bank.  2007.  Reducing  Investment  Climate  Constraints  to  Higher  Growth.  Manila  and \nWashington, DC. \n ", "  13\nranked  infrastructure,  inadequate  skills,  and  taxation  as  their  major  business  constraints. \nInvestors also found that some constraints have improved while others may have deteriorated \nsince 2005. According to the GTZ survey, more investors feel that excessive red tape and \nfinding skilled labor are bigger problems in 2007 than in 2005, while competitive pressures are \nless of a problem in 2007, and no change has been observed in infrastructure (Appendix 6). \nSome caution should be taken when comparing changes in perception over time as these are \nshaped from a combination of first-hand experiences as well as exposure to new knowledge \nabout best international or regional practices (which may be particularly significant in transition \neconomies like the Lao PDR). On a global comparison, the Lao PDR ranks relatively low. The \nDoing Business report 2009 ranks the Lao PDR 165th out of 181 countries, slipping three places \nover its ranking in 2008 (Appendix 6).12  \n \n24.  Progress  on  business  registration. Until recently, several steps were required to \nregister an enterprise\u2014involving several agencies, depending on the sector, and an excessive \namount  of documentation.  Firms were  required  to  produce  18 documents  and  obtain pre-\napproval from relevant line ministries and other authorities to qualify for registration. Under this \nsystem, it took firms 60 days on average to obtain a basic registration certificate, along with the \nexpenditure of significant staff and other resources. Reregistration was required each year, so \nsuch costs were incurred on an annual basis. These costs provided a significant disincentive for \nfirms to register, weakening the Government\u2019s ability to increase the tax base or monitor private \nsector development effectively. Significant costs were also imposed on the Government, arising \nfrom the resources required to administer such a system (well over 300 staff were employed in \nthis regard). A 2009 ADB study (red tape study) estimated that the enterprise registration \nsystem  cost  the  business  community  more  than  $6  million  annually  to  comply  with  the \nregistration process.13 \n \n25.  The Government has made significant progress in modernizing the business licensing \nprocess. Notably, under the new enterprise law, registration procedures have been markedly \nstreamlined, and the period allowed for registration of enterprises not on the negative list has \nbeen limited to 10 days (compared with 60 days on average in practice under the previous \nregime).14 To help meet these targets, the Government is modernizing its enterprise registration \nsystem. MOIC, with ADB technical assistance has simplified enterprise registration procedures \nand developed a computerized system that allows for more efficient implementation of the \nregistration process as well as monitoring of firms, through use of a centralized database in \nVientiane linked via internet to client systems in provincial enterprise registry offices. 15 The new \nsystem  began  operation  in  August  2008  with  four  pilot  provinces  and  is  being  rolled  out \nnationwide in a phased manner\u2014with coverage of all 17 provinces expected to be complete by \nlate 2010 (para. 57). \n \n26.  Investment law. The Foreign Investment Law and the Domestic Investment Law were \namended in 2004 and were important milestones in the Lao PDR\u2019s transition to an open market \neconomy, as they set out a broad framework to promote investment. However, they have major \nweaknesses. As foreign and domestic investors are covered under different investment laws \nand approval conditions, national or equal treatment is compromised. There is an element of \n                                                 \n12 World Bank. 2009. Doing Business 2009. Washington, DC. \n13 ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n14 Owners can now register their enterprises directly at the enterprise registry office for any economic activity not on \nthe negative list. Only those wishing to register a firm for operation in sectors on the list must first seek approval \nfrom the relevant line ministry. \n15 ADB. 2007.

Manila.  \n ", " 1 4   \n \nunpredictability  in  the  administration  of  investment  incentives,  as  the  duration  of  some \nincentives appears to be open-ended. The list of sectors closed to foreign investment, or open \nunder certain conditions, is not consistent with the negative list under the enterprise law of 2006. \nMost countries have shifted away from using a positive list for foreign investment to a negative \nlist, as it increases transparency and predictability for investors. Ideally, the list of conditional or \nclosed sectors under the investment law should be synchronized with those on the negative list \nunder the enterprise law; i.e., the list of sectors on both lists should be consistent. Given the \nimportance of FDI to Lao PDR development, these issues in the investment regime need to be \naddressed. \n \n27.  Excessive red tape. While the enterprise law addresses problems with registration, it \ndoes  not  deal  with  other  operating  business  licenses  issued  by  line  agencies.  There  is \nexcessive red tape affecting business operations. Under current practice, regulations are often \nformulated in an ad hoc manner by technical staff in line ministries subject to tight deadlines, \nwhich leaves little room for stakeholder consultation or assessment of costs to individual firms or \nthe economy as a whole. This has helped contribute to an existing stock of business-related \nregulations that are unduly burdensome and costly for the private sector, serving to undermine \nthe competitiveness of Lao PDR firms and weakening the country\u2019s attractiveness to investment. \n \n28.  The  ADB  red  tape  study  estimates  that  firms  incur  annual  average  expenses  of \nKN4.1 million  to  comply  with  the  three  most  common  types  of  licenses  (referred  to  as \npermissions in Lao PDR)\u2014enterprise registration certificate, sector operation license, and tax \ncertificate (footnote 13). This cost the business community an estimated KN266 billion annually \nin 2008, or 0.7% of GDP (Figure 4a). Firms typically have to comply with dozens of regulations, \ndepending on their line of business, which adds to business compliance costs. A realistic \nestimate of total compliance costs would be 1.5%\u20133.0% of GDP. The major component of \nbusiness compliance costs is the enterprise\u2019s staff time and own financial resources used to \nprepare documentation and apply for the license. The burden of business regulatory costs falls \ndisproportionately on small enterprises. On an employee basis, business compliance costs are \nmuch higher in small enterprises (KN258,442) than in medium-sized enterprises (KN120,000) \nand large firms (KN27,000). This illustrates how the regulatory burden falls most heavily on \nsmall enterprises in the formal sector, and becomes a barrier to the formalization and growth of \nsmall enterprises.  \n \n29.  Need  to  improve  quality  of  regulations  and  reduce  compliance  costs.  The \nGovernment lacks a system whereby laws and regulations affecting licensing and inspection are \nreviewed to determine the impact on the private sector. As a result, the regulatory compliance \ncosts  imposed  on  the  private  sector  are  not  appreciated.  To  help  improve  the  quality  of \nregulations and minimize compliance costs for the private sector, a more systematic approach \nneeds to be taken in their formulation and/or review. Ideally, and following international best \npractice on regulatory impact assessment, this would involve use of a systematic approach to \nassess and make transparent the costs of particular regulations for individual firms as well as \nthe economy as a whole (Appendix 6). This is a long-term effort. As a starting point, the \nGovernment should start with raising public awareness on the need for a regulatory reform \nprogram, and achieve broad agreement on the appropriate plan and institutional set-up for \naddressing red tape over the longer term. \n \n ", "  15\nFigure 4: Business Compliance Costs \n  (a) Compliance costs by common licenses             (b) Composition of compliance costs  \nProfessional certificate of pharmacy\nFacilitation fees\nEnterprise registration\n7%\nImport certificate\nEntertainment license\nOfficial fees\n32%\nTax certificate\nEnterprises' staff \nOperational license Time Costs\n61%\nDrug registration\n500 800 1,100 1,400 1,700 2,000\nAmount per firm (KN'000)\n    \n (c) Compliance costs by firm sizea          (d) Compliance cost by sector \n300 7.0\n0\n0 250\n0 6.0\nN'\nK\ne  200 0\ne 0\ny 05.0\nemplo 150 nt KN'\nper  100 mou4.0\nnt  A\nu\nmo 50 3.0\nA\n0\n2.0\nMicro- Small Medium Large\nManufacturing Trading Pharmaceuticals Tourism\nennterprises enterprises enterprises enterprises\n      \na Compliance costs per employee of the three main licenses\u2014enterprise registration, operational license, and tax \ncertificate. \nSource: ADB. 2009.

The Government considers WTO accession a key foreign trade policy \npriority and this is accelerating the momentum for finishing the trade reform agenda. The \nGovernment\u2019s preparations for WTO accession have had an influence on the way it views trade \npolicy and the business climate. In this regard, MOIC is considering ways to accelerate reforms \nto the import and export management system. It intends to continue to reduce the number of \nsectors on the import control list, and streamline and simplify import and export procedures and \nregulations. The WTO accession efforts follow on from the Lao PDR\u2019s commitments to the \nCommon  Effective  Preferential  Tariff  (CEPT) schedule  under  the  Association  of  Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Agreement (AFTA). The Government has made progress in \nimplementing the CEPT schedule for items in the inclusive list (0%\u20135%), which covers 98% of \nall tariff lines. As a consequence of a process of market-oriented reforms that began in the late \n1980s, the average customs duty has fallen to about 10%, which is among the lowest in the \nregion. Going forward, it is opportune to advance the reform momentum toward reducing the \nremaining non-tariff barriers and investment distortions\u2014including technical barriers to trade \n(TBTs); reform of trade facilitation (logistics, sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards systems, or \n ", " 1 6   \n \nsanitary and phyto-sanitary standards, and customs); consolidation of other incentives that \nnegatively  affect  investment  and  trade  decisions;  and  support  for  implementation  of  the \nLao PDR\u2019s WTO commitments once it accedes to the WTO (tentatively planned for 2012). \nSubprogram  2  deals  with  a  subset  of  these  reform  areas.  Other  areas  (especially  trade \nfacilitation and post-WTO implementation) are a long-term agenda requiring strong coordination \namong development partners. \n \n31.  Effective rates of protection. The degree of protection afforded to domestic industry \nthrough imposition of custom duties, non-tariff barriers, and domestic taxes on products can be \nmeasured by estimates of the effective rate of protection (ERP). A positive estimate of the ERP \nindicates  the  height  of  protection  afforded  to  domestic  industry  while  a  negative  estimate \nindicates the height of negative protection (or disincentive to produce) afforded to domestic \nindustry. Variations in estimates of ERPs for different sectors of the economy reveal the extent \nof resource misallocation (or distortions) within the economy caused by the trade and tax policy \nregime,  and  provide  a  useful  tool  for  assessing  a  country\u2019s  trade  policy  and  promoting \ntransparency.  ADB  and  MOIC  staff  estimates  of  ERPs  show  that  pockets  of  significant \nprotection to industry remain, such as in food, beverages, and tobacco (Table 3). The trade \npolicy and incentives regime appears to be biased against sectors that have potential to be \nexport-oriented,  as  reflected  in  sizeable  negative  protection  in  some  of  these  sectors \n(agriculture and textile and garments). Once the AFTA CEPT schedule is completed, protection \nin some of these sectors (auto and motorcycle assembly, and some processed foods) will \ndisappear. Sector-specific reforms may be needed in some of the others (e.g., cement) to \nenhance economic efficiency (Appendix 6). The estimates do not include fiscal investment \nincentives, which are considered generous and vary across sectors and across firms within \nsectors.  If  these  are  included,  the  variation  in  ERPs  could  be  larger.  A  comprehensive \nassessment of investment incentives is necessary.  \n \n32.  Import licensing and administrative procedures. These are the major remaining non-\ntariff barriers, but are being phased out by the Government to be consistent with WTO rules. \nThe Lao PDR operates an import\u2013export management and control system, identical to the one \noperated in Viet Nam until recently. There are two key features of the import and export \nmanagement system. The first feature is the import licensing regulation and its identification of \nitems subject to restrictive import licensing. It categorizes imports into three categories: (i) \nprohibited goods,16 (ii) controlled goods, and (iii) general goods that are easily imported. Goods \nmay be prohibited based on public safety, environmental, or moral concerns, but not to protect \ndomestic producers. The controlled category deals with licenses for imports that are not banned \nbut managed by MOIC. Until October 2006, these included about 25 broadly defined items such \nas prepared foods and all raw and semi-manufactured products used in manufacturing. MOIC is \nreforming the import and export management system and has made substantial reforms since \n2006 to reduce trade facilitation costs. The list of items on the controlled list was revised in \nOctober 2006. Under subprogram 2, the Government has revised the import regulation to be \nconsistent with WTO requirements, including the use of non-automatic and automatic licenses. \nThe number of import items subject to non-automatic licenses on the controlled list has also \nbeen further reduced (para 61). \n                                                 \n16 The list of prohibited goods and controlled goods set out in MOIC notice No. 1376 of October 2006. Previous MOIC \n    notices of prohibited goods and controlled goods were set out in notices No. 284 and 285 of March 2004. \n ", "  17\nTable 3: Industry Protection\u2014Effective Rates of Protection (%) \nExport or \nSector  Import Sector  ERP \nCrops  E  (5.0) \nLivestock and poultry  E  (8.0) \nForestry and logging  E  (11.8) \nMining and quarrying  E  (11.0) \nFood, beverages, and tobacco  I  104.8 \nTextiles, garments, and leather products  E  (6.8) \nWood and paper products, printing, and publication  E  (0.4) \nChemical products  I  2.0 \nNon-metallic mineral products     I  (4.3) \nMetal products, machinery     I  9.5 \nOther manufactured products     I  6.1 \n( ) = negative, E = export-oriented sector, ERP = effective rate of protection, I = import-oriented sector.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Industry and Commerce staff estimates.  \n \n33.  The second feature of the import\u2013export management system in need of reform has \nbeen the import administrative procedures as defined under prime minister's decree 205 and its \ncirculars. Over the last 3 years, however, these have been significantly rationalized with the \nremoval of MOIC officials at customs posts as well as the requirement for producers to provide \nimport plans. The Government is preparing revisions to the regulation to ensure consistency \nwith WTO rules, especially in relation to trading rights and administration of quotas. \n \n34.  Technical barriers to trade. In preparation for WTO accession, the Government is \nreviewing  technical  barriers  to  trade,  such  as  those  related  to  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary \nstandards (SPS), with a view to making them consistent with WTO rules. This will involve \nestablishing procedures for notifying SPSs and other TBTs to the WTO, and designating an \ninquiry  point  within  government  for  such  notifications.  Early  progress  has  been  made  in \nstrengthening the SPS regulatory environment to ensure consistency with the WTO, as a series \nof decrees was issued related to food safety management\u2014including principles for application \nof SPSs and technical measures for food safety management, plant protection, and quarantine \nlaw. As the Government considers completion of WTO commitments important for its world \ntrade integration efforts, it must strengthen the capacity to implement the required policy reforms \nand to establish compliance notification procedures across relevant agencies.  \n \n35.  Capacity building in trade policy. The institutional arrangements and processes for \nmaking trade policy are just as important as reforms to the trade policy regime. The Department \nof Foreign Trade Policy at MOIC sets the broad trade policy framework and agenda. It is taking \nthe  lead  in  WTO  preparations  and  has  responsibility  for  AFTA.  With  only  30  staff,  it  is \noverstretched and under-resourced to conduct adequate trade policy analysis\u2014an area that will \nbe critical to support further trade reform and effective participation in the WTO. \n \n36.  While the Department of Foreign Trade Policy has a key role in determining trade policy, \na number of other agencies also play significant parts, including the Department of Export and \nImport Management that sets import and export procedures, and compiles the controlled import \nlist. The ministries of agriculture, health, communication, transport, post, and construction\u2014as \nwell as MOIC\u2014control import licensing in their respective sectors and produce TBTs, including \nSPSs. Ensuring consistency of trade policy across the whole Government will be a challenge, \nas in most countries. It is also important for the Lao PDR to continue to build its own capacity to \ncarry  out  policy  analysis  on  its  merits  for  the  Lao  PDR.  Under  ADB  technical  assistance \n(footnote 15) training on trade policy tools has been provided to staff at MOIC and other \nministries, and staff from the Department of Foreign Trade Policy worked with ADB staff to \n ", " 1 8   \n \ndevelop capacity to estimate ERPs. Other activities included writing and presentation skills, \nmedia communication for senior officials, and training on trade policy tools. ADB staff also \nprovided training on free trade agreements. It will be important to continue this longer term \ncapacity development to support the reform momentum. \n \n37.  Trade facilitation. The performance of trade logistic services is critical to determine if \nthe Lao PDR can trade goods and services on time and at low costs. A cross-country study \nconducted by the World Bank17 suggests that high logistics costs and, more importantly, low \nlevel of services are barriers to trade and hence, growth. Available indicators suggest that \nLao PDR businesses bear a higher cost of logistics than other countries in the region (Figure 5). \nThe  logistics  performance  index  ranks  the  Lao  PDR  above  most  countries  in  the  region, \nmeaning it is less efficient (costly and time-consuming). This index is developed based on a \ncomprehensive survey of supply chain performance, including customs procedures, logistic \ncosts, infrastructure quality, and the competence of the domestic logistics industry. \n \n38.  SPS are crucial to microeconomic infrastructure to improve the private sector\u2019s access to \nthe international market for agro-based products. Lao PDR exports of such products are in their \ninfancy, and inadequate SPS management systems are an obstacle to development of such \nexports. The Lao PDR coffee industry has an estimated export value of $60 million only. When it \naccedes to the WTO, the Lao PDR will have agreed to SPS compliance within a transitional \nperiod, usually 5 years. Based on the experience of Cambodia, it is unlikely to achieve this \ncommitment on time. It will require a comprehensive assessment of the regulatory regime and \nsupporting institutions. There are no internationally accredited assessors in the Lao PDR and \nthe technical capacity of laboratories to undertake SPS-related testing is very limited. Therefore, \nmuch  needs  to  be  done  to  strengthen  the  regulatory  environment,  including  promoting \ncompetition in the sector, developing private sector providers, upgrading equipment, and testing \nprocedures and staff training in the laboratories. The Government recognizes that much needs \nto be done to strengthen SPS management systems and capacity, and that this is a longer term \neffort. It had developed an action plan for SPS under the integrated framework diagnostic study \nundertaken in 2006. The action plan will need to be reviewed in light of WTO accession efforts \nand  developments  in  the  region,  and  its  implementation  started.  ADB\u2019s  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) trade facilitation activities are considering ways to harmonize trade facilitation, \nincluding SPS systems, across the GMS.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17 World Bank. 2007.

While assessing the implementation progress of triggers (Appendix 10), a number of \nlessons were identified and have informed the formulation of subprogram 2. These include the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  The program cluster, with a subsequent subprogram linked by triggers within a \nmedium-term framework, has encouraged government ownership of the Program \nand continuous dialogue on policy. \n(ii)  Substantial progress on the policy triggers had been made through support from \nTA.  \n(iii)  The  approach  of  using  a  program  cluster  with  triggers  contains  adequate \nflexibility  to  respond  to  lessons  identified  during  implementation  and  to \nincorporate  new  developments  in  policy  and  government  priorities,  such  as \nupgrading of the CIB.  \n(iv)  In the context of the current global financial crisis and its transmission to the Lao \nPDR, and since subprogram 2 is the final subprogram under this program cluster, \nit is paramount to continue policy dialogue and engagement with the Government \nto  maintain  the  reform  momentum.  The  program  cluster  provides  adequate \nflexibility  though  its  medium-term  framework  to  incorporate  a  post-program \nmonitoring  framework  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  short-term  action  plan \n(Appendix 3 policy matrix). \n(v)  Some  of  the  reforms  under  subprogram  2  and  the  post-program  monitoring \nframework are similar to reforms in other ADB programs in the GMS, and lessons \nfrom these programs are applied to subprogram 2 of the PSME. In particular, \npromoting  reforms  through  interministerial  taskforces  or  committees  face \nsignificant  coordination  difficulties  in  an  environment  where  ministries  often \noperate within \u201cpolicy silos\u201d (i.e., in isolation). Implementing reforms is made \nharder when the interagency taskforce is mandated with several responsibilities \n ", " 2 0   \n \nand  functions.  To  overcome  this,  the  PSME  establishes  a  stand-alone \ninteragency  taskforce  on  regulatory  impact  assessments,  chaired  by  Vice-\nMinister for Industry and Commerce. \n \n40.  As a result, subprogram 2 incorporates several new important policy accomplishments \nthat have enhanced the Government\u2019s agenda in the three core areas, of which some are \ndesigned to further the reform agenda. \n \n41.  Distinct features of the PSME program cluster include the consultative approach taken \nthroughout its formulation. Under subprogram 1, a series of workshops had been organized for \neach component with a view to achieving the commitment of the Government and stakeholders. \nThe  design  of  TA  was  shaped  in  support  of  implementing  the  five  policy  triggers  under \nsubprogram 2, as well as broadening the reform agenda for subprogram 2 by providing detailed \nanalytical work and active consultations with stakeholders to ensure adequate \u201cbuy-in\u201d and \ngovernment ownership of the Program. Examples include high-level policy discussion with the \nGovernment on the level of protection in the economy and the results of the red tape study. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n42.  The impact of subprogram 2 is to achieve sustainable economic growth in the non-\nresource sector, supported by increased contribution of the private sector and SMEs. The \noutcome of subprogram 2 is an improved business environment where the private sector and \nSMEs operate efficiently and effectively. An expanding private sector will generate more and \nbetter jobs, and contribute toward sustainable poverty reduction. \n \n43.  The PSME program cluster includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the key \npriorities of the Lao PDR sixth Social and Economic Development Plan and its sector strategies. \nThese reforms are designed to accomplish the following results.  \n \n(i)  Improve institutional coordination for SME policy and access to finance by \n(a) strengthening the institutional framework for SME policy formulation and (b) \nimproving SME access to finance through improvements in accounting rules and \nguidelines, and development of nonbank financial instruments. \n(ii)  Strengthen the investment climate by (a) implementing the enterprise law, \n(b) other  policy  reforms  aimed  at  reducing  the  transaction  costs  of  doing \nbusiness  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  (c)  more  transparency  in  the  regulatory \nenvironment affecting SMEs. \n(iii)  Improve trade policy and capacity development by (a) reforming the import\u2013\nexport management system, including making measures more transparent, and \nover  the  medium  term  reforming  the  controlled  list  of  imports,  and  (b) \nstrengthening indigenous capacity to carry out trade policy analysis.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n44.  All 14 policy measures required for subprogram 2 had been carried out by mid-August \n2009. \n \n45.  The  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  for  subprogram  1  of  the  PSME \nidentified five policy triggers for subprogram 2 (footnote 3). While assessing implementation \n ", "  21\nprogress, the Government proposed one new policy trigger to recognize recent developments in \nimproving access to finance\u2014the upgrading of the CIB from a manual, paper-based system to a \ncomputerized, web-based system. This will, among other things, ease access to finance by \nallowing borrowers to establish credit histories more readily and by allowing banks to access \nand  make  use  of  such  information  readily.  This  supplements  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to \ndisseminate  information  on  new  accounting  practices  to  SMEs  (Appendix  10  provides  an \nassessment of subprogram 2 triggers). \n \n46.  In total, the Government and ADB are focusing on six policy triggers, of which most are \nsupported by eight measures that support capacity development in the Implementing Agencies \n(IAs) (Appendix 3, policy matrix). The Government has made substantial progress in completing \nthese measures. It has fully or substantially accomplished the six policy triggers. All of the eight \nother supporting (non-triggers) measures have been completed. \n  \n47.  Progress in achieving the PSME  performance indicators and targets set out in the \ndesign and monitoring framework for subprogram 1 and updated for subprogram 2 (Appendix 1) \nhas  been  substantial.  Of  the  12  performance  indicators,  two  are  assessed  as  exceeding \nmedium-term program targets (increase in non-resource exports and number of days to launch \na business), six are assessed as being on track to achieve medium-term targets, two have \nslowed  (implementation  of  SME  strategy  and  days  it  takes  to  prepare  import  and  export \ndocumentation), and updated data not yet available for the remaining two indicators. \n \n48.  In the spirit of the PSME cluster, which aims to support the Government\u2019s policy reform \nagenda  on  a  continuous  basis  rather  than  through  predetermined  rigid  conditions,  the \nGovernment asked that the substantial progress be recognized. Furthermore, as individual \ngrants under the PSME cluster are sequenced to provide continuous support in a predictable \nmanner,  and  subprogram  2  is  the  final  one  of  this  cluster,  it  requested  ADB  and  the \ndevelopment partners to (i) remain fully engaged as part of the ongoing dialogue, (ii) support \nand  continuously  monitor  implementation  and  completion  of  the  remaining  policy  triggers, \n(iii) provide longer term capacity development support for a better investment environment, and \n(iv) support implementation of the post-PSME program monitoring framework. ADB\u2019s program \ncluster approach provides for such flexibility in reform programs that are implemented over time, \nby taking emerging circumstances into account. \n \n1.  Accomplishments under Subprogram 2 \n49.  Subprogram 2 focuses on three core areas of private sector development\u2014institutional \ndevelopment  for  SME  policy  and  access  to  finance;  investment  climate;  and  trade  policy, \ncapacity development, and trade facilitation.  \n \na.   Improve institutional Coordination for SME Policy and Access to \nFinance \n50.  Subprogram  2  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  (i)  strengthen  the  institutional \nframework  for  promoting  SME  policy  formulation  through  a  consultative  process  with \nstakeholders; and (ii) improve SME access to finance through improvements in accounting rules \nand guidelines, and development of nonbank financial instruments. The following measures \ntoward achieving these objectives were completed prior to Board consideration of subprogram 2. \n \n51.  SME strategy implementation. The SME strategy for 2007\u20132012 was formulated under \nsubprogram 1 and approved by the PMO in early 2008. Under subprogram 2, eight defined \nactivities of the strategy have been completed. Overall, 18.6% of planned activities have been \n ", " 2 2   \n \naccomplished or are ongoing, and 11.4% are planned to commence in 2009.18 The monitoring \nunit established at SMEPDO to monitor implementation published its first quarterly report in \n2009. The report produced performance indicators for many of the activities for the first time, \nand made recommendations based on these indicators for steps to accelerate implementation \nof delayed activities.  \n \n52.  Public\u2013private dialogue. To provide an effective channel for feedback from the private \nsector on issues facing firms at the provincial level, the Government (with support from GTZ) \nhas initiated P3Ds in a number of pilot provinces (footnote 8). These are intended to provide a \nregular  forum  to  bring  issues  facing  firms  to  the  attention  of  relevant  local  authorities  for \nresolution at the local level. Issues that cannot be appropriately addressed may be forwarded \nfor the attention of relevant authorities in the central Government. Feedback obtained through \nthe P3Ds can also provide valuable inputs for future policy direction and reforms. In recognition \nof their value, the Government is institutionalizing the P3Ds process in the four pilot provinces \nand  plans  to  replicate  it  in  other  provinces  going  forward.  Once  they  are  institutionalized \neffectively, it is anticipated that P3Ds will serve as a natural forum for the conduct of stakeholder \nconsultations under key initiatives supported by the Program, such as pilot testing regulatory \nimpact assessments. \n \n53.  Upgrading  and  modernization  of  Credit  Information  Bureau  and  system. \nRecognizing the importance of establishing a system that provides banks with access to timely \nand accurate customer credit and collateral information, the central bank is modernizing the \nsystem used by the CIB. This system had increasingly become a bottleneck on the credit \nassessment and approval process, in the face of rapid growth in the number of banks and \ndemand for lending from the private sector. The CIB is moving from a paper-based, manual \nsystem based on relayed fax requests and replies to a system that makes use of a centralized \ndatabase and web-based technology that will allow banks to access as well as update customer \ncredit and collateral information in real time (compared to current response times of up to \n1 week). With assistance from ADB and the EC, a prototype system has been developed in \nclose  collaboration  with  CIB  staff  and  has  been  pilot  tested  with  involvement  from  all \n20 commercial banks. Capacity building is also being provided to both the CIB and commercial \nbanks  in  implementation  of  the  new  system,  while  the  system  is  being  refined  to  reflect \nfeedback from the pilot-testing phase. Following this, it will be populated with data from the \ncommercial banks and rolled out on an operational basis by the end of 2009.  \n \n54.  SME accounting practices. The Government and development partners recognize that \npoor accounting and financial reporting capacity of SMEs limits their access to finance. Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government enacted a new accounting and auditing law. Under subprogram \n2, MOF produced training materials on basic accounting and bookkeeping practices under the \nnew law and disseminated these at training courses to enterprises with technical assistance and \nsupport provided under the EC SME project.  \n \nb.  Strengthen the Investment Climate \n \n55.  Subprogram 2 supports the Government\u2019s efforts to implement the enterprise law and \nsynchronize the investment lists with the negative list under the enterprise law. The main \nobjective is to expand the number of private enterprises (and therefore investment). Reform \nareas of critical significance targeted under subprogram 2 include (i) implementing the new \nenterprise law, such as the negative list, simplifying registration procedures, and establishing \n                                                 \n18 SMEPDO. 2009. Monitoring Report, 1st Quarter 2009. Vientiane: SMEPDO Monitoring Unit. \n ", "  23\nenterprise registry offices; and (ii) other policy reforms aimed at reducing transaction costs in \ndoing business. The following measures toward achieving these objectives were completed \nprior to Board consideration of subprogram 2. \n \n56.  Implementation  of  enterprise  law.  Several  measures  were  accomplished  in \nimplementing the enterprise law, and in particular to achieve the 10-day registration deadline for \ninvestments not on the negative list (the list was approved under subprogram 1). First, after \ncompleting necessary preparations for the enterprise registry, the Government made the new \nregistration system effective in August 2008 and started the reregistration of all firms under the \nnew registry system and in accordance with the negative list. Its purpose is to bring enterprises \nunder the new law and clean the enterprise registry database of firms that are no longer in \nbusiness. By the end of May 2009, about 41,000 firms had registered, of which over 7,000 \nrepresented  new  registrants  (firms  that  had  registered  for  the  first  time).  Second,  the \nGovernment (MOIC) simplified enterprise registration procedures aimed at reducing compliance \ncosts to businesses by: (i) reducing the number of documents required for registration from 18 \nto 2\u20136, depending on the type of applicant\u2014documentary requirements not pertinent to the \nregistration function and the enterprise law have been eliminated (e.g., the requirement for \ncurriculum  vitae,  declaration  of  sentencing,  and  asset  declaration);  (ii)  delegating  approval \nauthority  from  the  MOIC  to  the  registrar  of  the  Enterprise  Registry  Office  (ERO)  under \nministerial  instruction  No  225;  (iii)    issued  ministerial  instruction  No.  0995  on  enterprise \nregistration,  which  standardizes  enterprise  registration  procedures  for  all  provincial  offices \n(called a single window); and (iv) improved transparency in the registration process by posting \non MOIC\u2019s website all registration documents, and other legal documents, instructions, and \nnotices; as well as posting the steps for registration in the public area of registry offices.  \n \n57.  Enterprise  Registry  Office.  A  modernized  ERO  with  a  centralized  database  with \ninternet-based access is crucial to allow for efficient and effective implementation of the new \nenterprise law and enterprise registration system. Under subprogram 1, the central ERO was \nestablished.  Subprogram  2  focused  on  modernizing  the  ERO  at  the  central  level  (MOIC \nVientiane) and completed the upgrading of 7 provincial pilot EROs,19 which (i) established a \ncentralized  web-based  database  linked  to  the  provincial  pilot  EROs,  and  provides  timely \nupdates  on  registrations  nationally;  (ii) MOIC  produced  and  implemented  a  capacity \ndevelopment program with provincial EROs, including upgrading software and hardware, and \ntraining on implementing the new registration procedures; and (iii) ERO printed new, simplified \nregistration certificates. It will be important to complete the national rollout of the enterprise \nregistry system and offices although the remote offices will not be internet-based. \n \n58.  New investment law. MPI, in consultation with MOIC and stakeholders, drafted a new \nlaw on investment promotion and submitted it to the National Assembly in June 2009. The \nNational Assembly approved the draft law in July 2009 pending refinements to it (primarily \nrefinements to the language). This new law is a major achievement under subprogram 2. The \nnew law merges the separate foreign and domestic investment laws, provides for national \ntreatment between domestic and foreign investors, and streamlines the investment approval \nprocess.  \n  \n59.  Regulatory review program. Reforming red tape will be a long-term effort, as in most \ncountries. Subprogram 2 supports the Government\u2019s effort to streamline red tape by assisting \nwith the establishment of a regulatory review process in the medium term. SMEPDO and the \n                                                 \n19 These  ERO  provinces  include:  Bolikhamxai,  Champasak,  Khammouan,  Louang  Phrabang,  Savannakhet,  \nVientiane, Xiangkhouang. \n ", " 2 4   \n \nLao National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with ADB technical assistance (footnote 15) \nundertook a review of the business costs incurred by enterprises in complying with licenses and \npermits. The review consisted of a survey of 156 enterprises in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and \nSavannakhet.  The  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  review  were  presented  to  senior \ngovernment  officials  in  May  2009  and  again  in  July  2009,  as  a  first  step  toward  raising \nawareness of the need for a systematic regulatory review program. As a consequence of this \ndialogue, MOIC established an interministerial taskforce, chaired by the vice-minister of industry \nand commerce and comprising of representatives from the relevant line agencies to build a \ndegree of consensus on an action plan for implementing a regulatory impact assessment across \nnational agencies. SMEPDO completed the upgrade of its website and started posting major \nlaws, business licenses, and explanatory information on steps and processes to adhere to \ngovernment  regulations  on  registration  and  licensing  as  part  of  improving  regulatory \ntransparency. \n \nc.  Improve Trade Policy and Capacity Development \n60.  Subprogram 2 supports the Government\u2019s goals of continuing trade policy reforms to \nlower the costs of doing business for the private sector and facilitate integration of the economy \nwithin  the GMS,  AFTA,  and  the  global  economy\u2014including  participation  in  the  WTO.  The \nfollowing actions toward achieving these objectives were completed before Board consideration \nof subprogram 2. \n \n61.  Reforms to the import\u2013export management system. MOIC has taken a sequential \napproach to reforming the import\u2013export management system, based on the experience of \nneighboring countries such as Viet Nam. The approach is to improve transparency, reduce the \ndiscretion of trade officials, lower administrative costs, and later reduce the number of items \nrestricted and replace some of them with more transparent forms of protection. Measures \nundertaken toward this goal include the following. First, the PMO approved the revised decree \non import licensing procedures consistent with WTO rules. The decree distinguishes between \nautomatic and non-automatic licenses consistent with WTO rules. Second, based on the new \nPMO decree on import licensing procedures, MOIC prepared the draft notification of the import \nprohibited and controlled lists, which has fewer items than the 2006 notification. Prohibited \nimports are confined to guns and ammunition (except explosives used for industrial purposes) \nand illegal drugs. Items subject to non-automatic licenses (i.e., that need approval from the \nsector agency) on the controlled list are primarily for public health and safety, the environment, \nand  national  security  rather  than  protecting  industry.  These  industries  include  fertilizers, \npesticides, and other chemicals; animal medicines; explosives; and guns for industry use. The \nnew list also includes information on the sector regulation requiring an import license for that \nitem and its rationale. Three sectors (cement, steel, and rice) have had import restrictions for \nsome time, but are included on the 2009 draft list for the first time, as part of Government's \nefforts to improve transparency in the trade regime. Third, MOIC prepared a decree on the \napplication of rules of origin and submitted it to the PMO for approval. \n \n62.  Technical  barriers  to  trade.  MOIC,  in  collaboration  with  relevant  line  ministries, \ncommenced review and reform processes for TBT notification to the WTO. The focus has been \non strengthening the legal framework for sanitary and phytosanitary standards and other TBTs, \nconsistent with WTO rules. These accomplishments include the following: (i) updated action \nplans on sanitary and phytosanitary standards for the 5th working party at the WTO, that took \nplace in July 2009; (ii) MOIC and relevant ministries issued a series of decrees related to food \nsafety management; principles for application of SPS; and technical measures for food safety \nmanagement, plant protection, and quarantine law; and (iii) the Department of Health converted \nthe ad valorem fee for issuing import permits for food products to a specific rate, which is a \n ", "  25\nsignificant accomplishment toward cutting the costs of red tape and reducing the discretion of \ntrade officials issuing permits. \n \n63.  Capacity development at MOIC. Building capacity and staff training at MOIC is a core \nobjective of the PSME program. Under subprogram 2, with ADB technical assistance (footnote \n16) trade policy tools were developed for computing effective rates of protection (ERPs). MOIC \nestimated ERPs afforded to domestic industry\u2014the first time ERPs had been estimated for the \nLao PDR. Estimated ERPs are a useful transparency tool, as they highlight areas where high \nprotection may exist and its causes. The results of MOIC-ADB work show that ERPs are \nrelatively low across most sectors, although pockets of high protection still exist. They also show \nthat some key potential export sectors have negative protection, meaning that protection given \nelsewhere in the economy has lowered its competitiveness.  \n \nd.  Impact and Outcomes and of the PSME Program \n64.  The reforms to the enterprise registration system will potentially have a substantial \nimpact on business compliance costs. The ADB-SMEPDO red tape review estimates that these \nchanges  will  reduce  the  business  compliance  cost  of  registering  enterprises  by  over  35% \nthrough  savings  in  staff  time  and  costs  in  preparing  documentation  and  applying  for  the \ncertificate,  and  follow-up.  Even  more  substantial,  businesses  are  not  required  to  renew \nregistration  each  year.  Based  on  the  review,  this  will  save  businesses  at  least  $6  million \nannually (in 2008 prices). The immediate benefits are evident, with over 5,000 enterprises \nregistering for the first time\u2014as of May 2009, 41,000 enterprises have registered under the new \nlaw. The new investment law will enhance predictability in the investment framework and attract \nadditional foreign investment. The reforms to the import\u2013export management system have \nopened up new trade opportunities, will increase integration with neighboring economies, and \nwill lower domestic prices. Consequently, the Program will have indirectly contributed to an \nincrease in imports and exports of non-resource goods since 2006.   \n \n2.  Post-Program Monitoring Framework \n65.  The development policy letter sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for the next  \n1\u20132 years, building on the reform momentum of subprograms 1 and 2. The Government and \nADB have agreed to a post-PSME program monitoring framework for 12 months, focusing on \n12 policy measures and capacity development efforts of the Government\u2019s short-term plan \nadvancing its reforms in SME policy development, investment climate, and trade policy and \nfacilitation (Table 4 and Appendix 3). Monitoring arrangements are discussed in paras. 69 \nand 76.  \n \n ", " 2 6   \n \nTable 4: Post-Program Monitoring Framework \n(Short-Term Measures) \nInstitutional Development for SME  Investment Climate  Trade Policy, Capacity, and  \nPolicy and Access to Finance  Trade Facilitation \n(1) Institutionalize the P3D in the four  (4) Complete rollout of the enterprise  (8) MOIC prepares amendments to \nprovinces  registry offices to all provincial offices  decree 205 on the import\u2013export \n  management system to ensure \nconsistency with WTO rules. \n(2) Bank of Lao PDR will continue to  (5) MPI to prepare and issue  (9) PMO approves decree on the \nrefine the CIB and roll out its  implementing decrees once the new  application of rules of origin \noperationalization  investment law has been enacted by \nthe President of Lao PDR \n(3) Conduct study on ways to  (6) SMEPDO continues to post  (10) MOIC coordinates with line \ndevelop the Lao PDR accounting  regulations on its website  ministries in implementation of action \nprofession    plans on SPS and other TBTs \nconsistent with WTO rules \n  (7) The RIA interagency taskforce  (11) MOIC reviews SPS \ncarries out public awareness raising  management systems \nabout RIA, and prepares draft action \nplan and time frame for implementing \nRIA across line ministries.

Financing Plan \n \n66.  The Government has requested an Asian Development Fund grant of $15 million to \nfinance  subprogram  2  of  the  program  cluster,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the \nBoard.  \n \n67.  The ADB funds are to support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter \n(Appendix 2) and policy matrix (Appendix 3). The grant size was increased from $5 million, as \ninitially planned when the program cluster was approved by the Board in October 2007, to $15 \nmillion. At the time of designing the program cluster in 2007, it was felt that the $5 million grant \nfor subprogram 2 was relatively small when measured against the expected prior actions of \nsubprogram 2. However, at that time limited Asian Development Fund funds to the Lao PDR did \nnot permit more realistic funding of the Program. The increase grant from $5 million to $15 \nmillion is also justified on the basis that policy accomplishments under subprogram 2 have \nsurpassed program expectations, its positive development impact on private sector growth and \nits  links  to  job  creation  and  sustainable  poverty  reduction  (Appendixes  7  and  9).  Direct \nadjustment  costs  include  (i) foregone  budget  revenues  from  reform  of  the  import\u2013export \nmanagement  mechanism;  and  (ii) the  costs  of  carrying  out  improvements  to  the  business \nregistration system and establishment of business registry information systems and offices in \n ", "  27\nthe provinces, as well as establishing systems for posting regulations, licenses, and permits \nrequired to start and operate a business on the SMEPDO website. Therefore the total program \ncluster financing has increased from $10 million to $20 million. \n \n68.  The program grant also reflects the development financing needs of the Government. \nThe collapse in copper and other commodity prices has resulted in a reduction in program \nbudget revenues by up to 1% of GDP. As a result, the budget shortfall is $50 million\u2013$60 million \nfor FY2009. To address the shortfall, the Government will raise excise taxes on alcohol and \npetroleum  and  the  Government  has  requested  additional  grant  support  from  development \npartners.  The  proposed  grant  amount  of  $15  million  for  subprogram  2  will  help  close  the \nfinancing gap for FY2009 (Table 5).  \n \nTable 5:  Projected Financing Sources for 2009 \n($ million) \nProgrammed external borrowings and grants in 2009  Proposed Amounts in 2009  \n \nADB\u2019s planned disbursementsa  88.7  \n        of which:   \nBSRP third tranche    5.0  \nPSME subprogram 2  15.0  \n   \nOther donor                73.5 a \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BSRP = Banking Sector Reform Program, PSME = Private Sector and \nSME Development Program. \n              Note: An exchange rate of KN8,500 = $1 was used for calculations. \na  Planned disbursements for 2009.  \n  Source: Ministry of Finance and ADB.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n \n69.  The implementation arrangements established under subprogram 1 will remain under \nsubprogram 2. MOIC will be the Executing Agency (EA). It will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation  of  subprogram  2,  including  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program \nadministration, and maintenance of all program records. The PSME steering committee, chaired \nby the minister of industry and commerce and comprising senior officials from BOL, MOF, and \nMPI, is responsible for coordinating the implementation and sustaining of the PSME policy \nactions with MOIC and relevant line agencies involved in supporting the PSME Program (BOL, \nMOF and MPI) and the post-program monitoring framework. The committee will meet twice a \nyear to monitor progress and oversee implementation of the PSME Program and the post-\nprogram monitoring framework. ADB will participate in the meetings. English translations of the \nminutes of these meetings will be forwarded to ADB within 2 weeks of each meeting. MOIC will \nbe  responsible  for  day-to-day  program  implementation  activities,  and  will  report  on \nimplementation progress. The BOL and MPI will be acting as implementing agencies. MOF will \nbe responsible for subprogram 2 disbursements and accounts maintenance.  \n \n ", " 2 8   \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n70.  Subprogram 2 of PSME program period is from October 2007 to September 2009. All \nactions included in the policy matrix for subprogram 2 were implemented by mid-August 2009.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n71.  The program grant of $15 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness.  \nThe grant proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries and incurred no \nmore than 180 days before the effectiveness date of the grant, excluding the items specified in \nthe negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 8) and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,20 the proceeds of the program grant \nwill be disbursed to the Lao PDR as the recipient. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired, if during each year that grant proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Lao \nPDR total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  prior  to  the  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under \nexisting  procedures  will  be  required.  Disbursements  will  be  made  under  the  simplified \nprocedures for program loans. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and \nrelated requirements for program grants, all goods and services produced and originating in \nADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n72.  The  reform  needs  supported  under  the  PSME  will  be  met  through  local  currency \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the PSME grant.   \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Assessment \n \n73.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n74.  An assessment of the country\u2019s financial management systems has been carried out to \nunderstand  fiduciary  risks  better  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  for  the \npurpose of this Program. This assessment was based on the Lao PDR Public Expenditure \nReview  and  Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  Report  (PER)  led  by  the  World  Bank  and \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1998.

Based on this \nassessment, the PER determined that the fiduciary risk in the use and management of public \nfunds is high. The Government is aware of the need to increase the amount of public resources \nallocated  to  planning  and  management  to  overcome  significant  weaknesses  in  the  basic \nsystems and processes for budget preparation, execution and control, reporting, and oversight. \nThe PER acknowledges that since 2002, the Government has taken significant actions to \naddress these weaknesses through its Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program \n(PEMSP), and implement the last PER recommendations including strengthening the public \naccounting framework by issuing implementation regulations and by implementing a unified \nbudget  nomenclature  and  chart  of  accounts  throughout  the  Government;  progressively \nimplementing a computerized government financial information system that has introduced an \nautomated system for accounting, budget execution control, and reporting that will improve the \ncapture  and  timely  reporting  of  data  and  increase  budget  control;  and  issuing  a  new \nprocurement decree and supporting implementation regulations and creating a Procurement \nMonitoring Office. ADB, the World Bank, and other development partners are working closely \nwith the Government to implement improved public sector financial management systems. ADB \nhas  been  supporting  MOF  with  fiscal  planning  and  budget  preparation22 and  the  second \ncomponent of the Government\u2019s Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program on \nbudget executing, accounting, and reporting. \n   \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n75.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at the Bank of the Lao PDR to receive all grant proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. \nMOIC will be required to submit quarterly progress reports as well as a final report on the \nprogress of subprogram 2 implementation.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Program Review \n \n76.  In cooperation with the PSME committee (para. 69), ADB will carry out periodic reviews \nof  program  implementation,  and  assess  the  impact  of  the  PSME  and  the  post-program \nmonitoring  framework.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy \ndiscussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  PSME \nimplementation, and provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy \nproposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  the  committee,  will  undertake  a  review  of  program \nperformance 8 months after grant effectiveness to review the outcome of subprogram 2. In \naddition  to  the  review  report,  the  committee  will  submit  to  ADB  within  8  months  of  grant \neffectiveness of subprogram 2, a review report that assesses compliance with, and the impact \nof, agreed actions under subprogram 2. In addition, participants in the Lao Business Forum \n(partner agencies, business groups, and other stakeholders) will be encouraged to support \nprivate sector monitoring of the reforms under the PSME. \n \n                                                 \n21 World Bank, IMF, ADB, and European Commission. 2007.

The Government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to \nmonitor the PSME implementation and evaluate its impact, within the overall PSME framework \n(Appendix 1).  \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n78.  The key benefits expected from the PSME program cluster are as follows: \n \n(i)  Improved investor confidence through completion of implementation of the new \nenterprise law and a new investment law that provides for national treatment \nbetween foreign and domestic investors. \n(ii)  Lower transaction costs for business because of streamlined business start-up \nprocedures, a reduction in red tape, and reform of remaining non-tariff barriers \nwhich will open new opportunities, increase investment and productivity, boost \nthe economy, and increase incomes and create jobs.  \n(iii)  Strengthened institutional development through raising capabilities in the EA and \nIAs to carry out trade, investment, and SME policy analysis with the aim of \nimproving the quality of policy, institutional processes for policy making. Posting \nregulations  on  the  SMEPDO  website  will  also  contribute  to  institutional \ndevelopment through better regulatory transparency. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n79.  The PSME program cluster is subject to the following risks:  \n \n(i)  In transitional economies, maintaining macroeconomic stability\u2013\u2013reflected in low \ninflation  and  a  stable  exchange  rate\u2013\u2013is  critical  for  investor  confidence  and \nprivate sector growth. The Lao PDR is particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic \ninstability because of weak institutions. It also faces emerging fiscal stress and \nmacroeconomic challenges in the context of the fall in resource revenues that \nthreaten to undermine recent gains in social spending and poverty reduction. The \nGovernment recognizes these risks and, with development partner assistance \nincluding ADB, is undertaking measures to raise revenue and strengthen public \nexpenditure management.  \n(ii)  The capacity of agencies to implement reforms may be constrained by resources \nand other emerging priorities. The PSME program cluster reduces this risk by \nlimiting the policy triggers to a small number of high-priority, high-impact policy \nreforms under the jurisdiction of the EA and a limited number of IAs (MPI and \nMOF), and by attaching TA to each policy trigger.  \n(iii)  There will be resistance to some reforms from vested interests. Reforms to the \nimport\u2013export management system and institutionalizing economic governance \nreforms\u2013\u2013i.e.,  red  tape  review  process\u2013\u2013are  likely  to  be  a  lengthy  process. \nResistance  may  also  come  from  entrenched  cultural  and  political  economy \nfactors that may slow market economy reforms and market competition, including \nthe  dominance  of  the  state  sector  in  some  sectors  (cement,  steel, \npharmaceuticals, food processing and beverages, and utilities). However, several \nfactors mitigate these risks: (a) the PSME strategic approach is to focus efforts \non supporting the Government\u2019s initiatives, and (b) reforms have focused on \nareas where there is political will and some measure of capacity. This has been \ndemonstrated  by  successful  implementation  of  the  enterprise  law  and \n ", "  31\nestablishment of the enterprise registry, which has resulted in substantial cuts in \nbusiness compliance costs and 7,000 enterprises registering for the first time in \n2008 and 2009.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n80.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  The Counterpart Funds will be used to finance the local currency costs relating to \nthe  implementation  of  subprogram  2  and  other  activities  consistent  with  the \nobjectives  of  subprogram  2  and  shall  provide  the  necessary  budget \nappropriations  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  relating  to  the \nimplementation of reforms under subprogram 2. \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the PSME grant agreement, as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue  to  be  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  PSME  program  cluster  and \nsubsequently. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n81.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding $15,000,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic from ADB's Special Funds \nresources for subprogram 2 of the Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nDevelopment Program, on the terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n    Haruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n \n \n9 September 2009 \n \n \n \n ", " 3 2  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Update to  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Subprogram 2  Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact         Assumption \nSustainable economic  By 2011, SEDP6      Macroeconomic \ngrowth supported by  goals attained:       stability maintained \nincreased contribution of         \nthe private sector and  Real GDP growth at  GDP growth of 7%\u2013 NSC data  Risks \nSMEs    7%\u20138% per annum  8% in 2007 and    Prolonged and severe \n  2008, expected to  Poverty incidence  global recession will \n  slow to 4%\u20135% in  data from NSC  lead to greater \n2009 because of    economic slowdown in \nglobal recession    Lao PDR than \n(on track)    anticipated \n \nThe collapse in \n \ncommodity prices does \n \nnot recover in the short \nterm, leading to \nincreased fiscal stress  \nOutcome        Assumption \nImproved business  By end of 2011:  ERO began  NSC enterprise  Government stays on \nenvironment where the  Increase number of  reregistration  survey  course with key fiscal \nprivate sector and SMEs  private enterprises  process under new  policy reform measures \nNSC published trade \noperate efficiently and  and SMEs formally  law in August 2008.  and business \ndata \neffectively  registered by as  By end of May 2009,  regulatory reform \n  much as 15% (2006  almost 30,000  GTZ enterprise   \n  baseline was 77,000  enterprises  baseline survey  Risk \nregistered firms)  registered\u2014of which  Lack of commitment \n  5,000 (or 17%)  NSC published  and willingness of \n  registered for the  consumer price  government agencies \n  first time (on track)  index  and stakeholders to \n    participate in \n \nIncrease number of  Data not yet  implementing reforms \nNext industrial \nenterprises (formal  available   \ncensus \nand informal) and   \n \nnumber of female   \n  \nentrepreneurs by   \n \n5% per year (2006   \nbaseline was   \n126,913 enterprises)   \n   \nIncrease  Employment data \nemployment in the  not yet available \nprivate sector   \n(baseline 102,000   \nworkers in industry   \nin 2004)   \n   \nIncrease non- Non-resource trade \nresource trade by  increased from \n5%\u201310% per annum  $980 million in 2004 \n(2004 baseline was  to $1.7 billion in \n$980 million)  2008, or about 17% \nper annum \n(exceeded \nexpectations) \n \n ", "Appendix 1  33\nDesign  Performance  Update to  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Subprogram 2  Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nOutputs  By end of 2010 (with      Assumption \n  baseline 2005 or      Government stays on \n1.

This assessment provides a summary of developments in macroeconomic policy. It also \npresents a summary assessment of debt sustainability.  \n \nA.   Macroeconomic Stability  \n \n2.  This  section  assesses  macroeconomic  performance  to  date  and  summarizes  the \ndiscussion of the key medium-term macroeconomic policy issues. While much has been done to \nput fiscal policy on a sound path, the collapse in commodity prices heightens four critical issues \nfor the Government in ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term: (i) increasing efforts \nto  mobilize  domestic  revenues,  (ii)  better  management  of  natural  resource  revenues, \n(iii) improving  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  management,  and  (iv)  improving  debt \nsustainability. We conclude that, with the collapse in commodity prices, sustainable adjustment \nwill require more efforts to raise domestic revenues resources over the medium term.  \n \n1.   Fiscal Policy \n \n3.  Fiscal  crisis:  1998\u20132001.  After  improving  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  the \nmacroeconomic fortunes of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) quickly reversed \nfollowing the Asian crisis. In the mid-1990s, budget revenues were improving and inflation was \non a downward trend. Then came the fall in demand for Lao PDR products arising from the \nAsian financial crisis and, exacerbated by expansion in domestic money supply to finance public \ninvestments in irrigation, led to a severe economic crisis. The kip exchange rate against the US \ndollar depreciated, leading to hyperinflation during 1998 and 1999, tax revenues plunged, and \nthe national government deficit increased sharply and public debt began to climb. The overall \nbudget deficit reached 5.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003. \n \n4.  A major factor contributing to deterioration of the fiscal balance was that revenues were \nundermined because (i) tax collection was deconcentrated with decentralization, and provincial \ngovernments  had  little  incentive  to  collect  and  pass  on  additional  taxes  to  the  central \nGovernment;  (ii)  several  sectors  were  outside  the  tax  base;  and  (iii)  tax  administration \nweaknesses persisted and were not addressed. \n \n5.  Emerging from crisis. In 2001, the Lao PDR emerged from the economic and fiscal \ncrisis. The Government has restored macroeconomic stability and has maintained it through \nfiscal discipline and better management of monetary policy. This has been at the expense of \nsuppressed expenditure in the social sectors (education and health) and a substantial decline in \npublic sector real wages. In the FY 2008 budget revenues exceeded the budget plan\u2014primarily \nas a result of increased collections from the booming mining sector, with resource revenues \namounting to 3.2% of GDP, up from 2.6% in 2007 and 1.9% in 2006. Overall, budget revenue \ncollections rose by 1.9 percentage points of GDP in 2008 over 2006 levels. As a result, the \noverall budget deficit as a share of GDP fell from 4.5% in 2005 to 2.9% in 2007 and 2.0% in \n2008, surpassing fiscal targets (Table A5.1). \n ", "Appendix 5  45\nTable A5.1: Fiscal Policy Indicators, 2001\u20132008 \n(%, unless otherwise stated) \n \n   \nItem  2003  2004  2005  2006   2007  2008a  \nRevenues and grants  13.0  12.1  12.7  14.6  15.8  15.6 \nRevenues  10.9  11.0  11.4  12.7  14.0  14.3 \n  Tax  8.9  9.1  9.4  10.8  12.1  12.5 \n     Resources    1.3  1.1  1.3  1.7  2.2  2.7 \n     Non-resource  7.6  8.0  8.1  9.2  10.0  9.8 \n  Non-tax  1.9  1.9  2.0  1.9  1.9  1.8 \nGrants  2.1  1.1  1.2  1.9  1.7  1.3 \n             \nExpenditures  18.6  15.5  16.0  17.7  18.6  17.7 \nCurrent   7.1  7.4  8.0  9.0  8.9  10.3 \nCapital expenditure  11.0  7.3  6.0  7.3  8.1  7.0 \nOther  0.5  0.8  2.0  1.0  1.6  0.4 \nOverall balance  (5.7)  (3.4)  (3.3)  (3.1)  (2.8)  (2.1) \nForeign Financing (net)  5.1  3.6  3.0  4.6  2.9  2.0 \n( ) = negative, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \na Estimated. \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Lao PDR; International Monetary Fund. 2008.

Booming \ncommodity  prices  from  2006  to  2008  raised  central  government  budget  revenues  by \n1.9 percentage points over 2005 levels and expectations were that the elevated commodity \nprices would continue for some years to come. This perception influenced the Government\u2019s \nmanagement of resource revenues and spending priorities. The 2009 budget formulated in early \n2008 assumed commodity prices would remain at elevated levels and resource revenues would \ncontribute to 30% of the increase in budget revenues in 2009. Overall, budget revenues were \nprojected to rise by 14% over the 2008 budget outturn. Paralleling revenues, planned current \nexpenditures were projected to rise by 24% and a projected overall budget deficit of 3.4% of \nGDP, which was considered manageable given that the Government had consistently exceeded \nrevenues projections in the previous two budgets. However, the underlying weakness of the \noverall  budget  can  be  ascertained  by  stripping  away  resource  revenues  from  the  central \ngovernment budget. The non-resource budget balance is much higher, at 5.3% of GDP in 2008, \nsuggesting the budget is vulnerable to deterioration in Lao PDR terms of trade (Figure A5.1). \nThe collapse in copper prices and other key minerals, except for gold, has feedback into a \nprojected decline in resource revenues by 21% below the 2009 budget plan and as a share of \nGDP. As a result, the overall budget deficit is expected to rise to 4%\u20135% of GDP in 2009 and \ncreate a budget financing shortfall of $50 million\u2013$60 million in FY2009. The Government is \naddressing  this  through  increased  excise  taxes  on  alcohol  and  retail  gasoline  sales,  and \nincreased grants from development partners. The stress in the fiscal situation may persist in \n2010 as corporate profit tax from the resource sector declines as losses are carried over.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 5 \n \nFigure A5.1: Resource Revenues and the National Government Budget \n \n (a) Overall Budget and Non-Resource Budget    (b) Impact of Commodity Prices on  \n      Deficits (% of GDP)                           Resource Revenues to the NG Budget \n6 4 350\n5 300\n3\n250\n4 ex\nP P d\n of GD3 % GD2 125000 Price in\n%\n2 1\n100\n1\n0 50\n0 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\nResource revenues to the budget\nOverall budget balance Non-resource budget balance Commodity price index\n      \n GDP = gross domestic product, NG = non government. \n Note: The commodity price index refers to the composite price index of metals and minerals (copper, gold, nickel,  \n silver, etc.). \n Sources: Budget data from the Ministry of Finance, Vientiane; Commodity price data from the Development  \n Economics Prospects Group, World Bank; and International Monetary Fund projection for 2009.   \n \n2.   Banking Sector \n \n7.  Impact of global financial crisis. Direct impacts of the global financial crisis on the \ndomestic financial system so far have remained negligible. The banking system has not been \naffected by the direct effect of the global crisis because of its low level of financial sector \ndevelopment (banking assets account for 15% of GDP) and almost nonexistent exposure to \ntroubled US assets. There is no corporate bond market, government treasury bills are not \ntraded  on  the  market,  and  the  Government  does  not  access  international  credit  markets. \nHowever, the banking system is vulnerable to the potential feedback loop from the global crisis \ntransmitting to the real sector, and the slowdown in the real sector transmitting to increased \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) and erosion of banking sector capital. The increased vulnerability \narises for two reasons. First, the three state-owned commercial banks (which account for about \n60% of banking sector assets) have a combined capital to asset ratio of 1.77%, indicating \nessentially no capital to buffer a modest deterioration in asset quality, such as a doubling of \nNPLs from the current 4% level. Lao Development Bank (LDB) and Agriculture Promotion Bank \n(APB) have negative capital and Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao (BCEL) capital \nturned positive in 2007 although it is still below the Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL) required 8% \ncapital\u2013asset ratio (CAR). Private banks reportedly have a CAR of 16%. Second, bank lending \nhad accelerated to unprecedented levels in 2008, rising by more than 50% in BCEL and LDB. \nThe loan to deposit ratios are relatively low (around 50%) and gross NPLs are low at 4% (on \nBOL\u2019s definition). However, the rate of increase in credit over a relatively short period and the \nslowing economy slowing are likely to increase NPLs over the next 12 months, especially if the \neconomic  slowdown  persists  into  2010.  BOL  recognizes  the  need  to  remain  vigilant  in \nmonitoring banks and NPLs, and in this context has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n ", "Appendix 5  47\ntechnical assistance (TA) for enhancing capacity and staff training in bank supervision\u2014both \non-site and off-site monitoring. ADB has proposed the Enhancing Financial Sector Supervision \nTA grant project covering (i) capacity development for effective supervision of microfinance \ninstitutions  under  the  Banks  and  Financial  Institutions  Supervision  Department  at  BOL, \n(ii) capacity development for effective supervision of commercial banks under the supervision \ndepartment,  and  (iii)  capacity  development  for  strengthening  the  anti-money-laundering \nintelligence unit. \n \nFigure A5.2: Banking Sector Indicators \n  (a) Combined capital\u2013asset ratio of SOCBs           (b) SOCB LDR and NPLs   \n4 60 14\n50 12\n2\n10\n40\n0\n2006 2007 2008 R 8 Ls\nD30 P\n-2 % L 6 % N\n20\n-4 4\n10 2\n-6\n0 0\n-8\n2006 2007 2008\n-10\nLDR NPLs\n          \n (c) Total outstanding loans (adjusted to inflation)     (d) 2008 Financial indicators of three SOCBsa \n6000\n6\n5000 4\n4000 2\nn\no\nbilli3000 %0\n \np BCEL LDB APB\ni\nK2000 -2\n1000 -4\n-6\n0\n2006 2007 2008\nCAR NPL\n          \nAPB = Agriculture Promotion Bank, BCEL = Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao, CAR = capital asset ratio, \nLao PDR  =  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  LDB =  Lao  Development  Bank;  LDR  =  loan\u2013deposit  ratio; \nNPL = nonperforming loan, SOCB = state-owned commercial bank. \na  Unaudited 2008 financial accounts of the three SOCBs.  \nSource: Bank of the Lao PDR. \n \n3.   External Sector \n \n8.  Balance of payments. The balance of payments surplus is expected to decline amid \npressure from the global financial crisis. The Lao PDR recorded a balance of payments surplus \nof $113 million or 2.0%  of GDP in 2008. Consequently, gross international reserves rose from \n ", "48  Appendix 5 \n$528  million  in  2007  to  $636  million  in  2008,  equivalent  to  about  3.4  months  of  imports. \nConventionally, at least 3 months of import coverage is considered a sufficient buffer against a \nmodest external shock. However, the global financial crisis has put increased pressure on the \nbalance of payments. Exports year-on-year started to decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 \nbecause of falling commodity prices and the slowdown in demand for garments from developed \ncountries. Imports also started to decline in the first quarter of 2009. It is projected that exports \n(mainly commodities) will decline by about 21% and imports by 14% in 2009. As a result, the \ncurrent account is expected to remain in deficit in the range of 14% of GDP. On the capital \naccount  side,  foreign  direct  investment  flows  are  expected  to  slow,  although  partially \ncompensated by increased inflows of official assistance.  \n3.   Medium-Term Macroeconomic Issues \n \n9.  Considerable fiscal gains have been achieved since 2001, and fiscal space has been \nprovided by taxes from commodities, but the global financial crisis and collapse in commodity \nprices highlight the importance of locking in these gains and building on them.   \n \n10.  Issue 1: Fiscal consolidation. Over the medium term, sustainable fiscal consolidation \nwill require further non-resource revenue effort.  The  Lao PDR has one of the lowest non-\nresource tax revenue to GDP ratios (about 10%) among low-income countries, partly because \nof the dominance of the subsistence agriculture sector. Substantial gains in non-resource tax \ncollection were made in 2006 and 2007, with revenues rising by two percentage points of GDP \nbecause of improvements in tax administration. However, these gains appear to have leveled \nout in 2008. Most of the recent gains in revenues come from royalties and profit taxes from the \nnatural resource sector. Revenue management is challenged by (i) the erosion of the income \ntax base caused by the proliferation of tax incentives in growth sectors of the economy\u2013\u2013about \n1,600   and  large  firms  have  significant  fiscal  incentives  under  the  investment  laws;  and \n(ii) persistently  weak  tax  administration.  The  Government  is  addressing  these  issues  in  a \nsystematic and sustainable way, and this will be a longer term effort. Importantly, the National \nAssembly  enacted  the  budget  law  in  2006,  which  re-concentrates  tax  collection.  The  law, \nmodeled on Viet Nam\u2019s budget law, defines revenues belonging to the central Government, \nprovincial  governments,  and  those  revenues  to  be  shared  between  central  and  provincial \ngovernments. The budget law also places the Treasury and Customs Department under central \ngovernment  authority,  ensuring  that  revenues  are  passed  to  the  central  Government.  The \nGovernment has designed a value-added tax and intended to implement it in January 2009. \nThis has been delayed because much work still needs to be done to clean up the taxpayer \nregistration, expand it, and develop a refund mechanism, and undertake taxpayer education.  \n \n11.  Fiscal outlook for 2009 and 2010. An outlook for fiscal policy over the next 2 years is \npresented in Table A5.2, which presents a baseline scenario based on assumptions of low \ncommodity prices and economic growth in the range of 4%\u20135% in 2009 with recovery in 2010. \nThe low-case scenario of a continued expenditure program with lower revenues would be a \nfiscal deficit projected up to 7.5% of GDP while a high case scenario of additional measures to \nraise revenue and lower expenditure would be a projected deficit of 3.5% of GDP. While the low \nand high scenarios are indicative, they demonstrate the need for continuing increasing revenue \neffort and expenditure management.  \n ", "Appendix 5  49\nTable A5.2: Lao PDR Medium-Term Outlook, 2009\u20132010 \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise stated) \nIndicator  2008  2009  2010 \nRevenues and grants  15.6  14.9  15.3 \n Revenues  14.3  12.9  13.2 \n   Tax  12.5  11.4  11.6 \n      Resourcesa  2.7  2.3  1.7 \n      Non-resource  9.8  9.1  9.9 \n   Non-tax  1.8  1.5  1.6 \nGrants  1.3  2.1  2.1 \n       \nExpenditures  17.7  22.8  21.1 \n  Domestic expenditure  12.8  18.3  16.2 \n    Wagesb  4.6  5.8  5.6 \n    Interest   0.8  0.8  0.9 \n    Otherc  7.4  11.2  9.7 \n  Development partner financed  4.8  4.5 \nexpenditure  4.9 \nOverall balance (excluding additional    (2.1)  (7.9)  (5.8) \nmeasures) d \nOverall balance (including additional    (3.5)  (3.5) \nmeasures) \nForeign financing (net)  3.0  2.4  2.6 \n       \nMemorandum items:       \nExternal public sector debt  71.5  69.1  66.7 \n   \nNominal GDP (fiscal year, KN billion)        44,993.0      48,391.0      52,106.0 \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \na  Includes taxes and royalties from timber, hydro, and mining sectors.  \nb  Includes salaries and benefits, compensation, and extra work allowances. \nc  Includes onlending, debt repayment, and contingencies. \nd  Additional measures refer to tax increases and reduced expenditures to bring the overall budget deficit to \n3.5% of GDP.

Medium-term fiscal sustainability requires \nimproving  efficiency  in the  public expenditure  management  by  ensuring  a  balanced  public \nexpenditure program between capital spending and recurrent expenditures, as well as between \ndiscretionary and nondiscretionary spending items (interest payments and wages).1 This will \nrequire  reorienting  spending  toward  priority  sectors  identified  in  the  Government\u2019s  poverty \nreduction strategy. In recent years, there have been large increases in public servant wages to \ncompensate for hyperinflation in 1998 and 1999. While this is understandable, the expansion in \nthe  wage  bill  and  other  nondiscretionary  items  should  be  more  prudent  going  forward. \nImplementing improved systems for public expenditure management\u2014including the medium-\nterm expenditure framework, which aligns the budget planning process with strategic objectives \nand priorities\u2014is integral to improving efficiency in public expenditure management. Progress is \nbeen  made.  The  Government  has  developed  a  public  expenditure  framework  and  is \nimplementing improved budget processes. It has shifted to a public financial management \nframework that includes the revenue side of the budget. The 2007 public expenditure review \n                                                 \n1   The share of discretionary spending in the national government budget has declined in the last 4 years from 62% \nin the FY2004 budget to 58% in the FY2006 budget and 56% in the FY2008 budget. In contrast, nondiscretionary \nspending on wages and salaries and transfers has increased from 32% in the FY2005 budget to 39% in the \nFY2008 budget.  \n ", "50  Appendix 5 \ncarried out by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), ADB, and the European \nCommission noted that public expenditure in education and roads is reasonably efficient and \nequitable, but less so in other sectors such as agriculture and health.2   \n \n13.  Issue  3:  Managing  resource  revenues.  The  collapse  in  commodity  prices  and \nfeedback to the fiscal situation reminds authorities and development partners of the realities of a \nresource sector that is characterized by a volatile commodity price cycle. The resource sector \nprovides the Lao PDR with a unique opportunity to fund its development goals and reduce its \naid dependence over the longer term. At the same time, it provides the Lao PDR with important \nchallenges as to how these revenues should be managed since such resource revenues are \nvolatile and unpredictable. There are good lessons from other similar small countries that have \nexperienced  similar  resource  booms.  Perhaps  the  most  successful  example  is  Botswana, \nanother small, resource-rich landlocked economy. Through cautious macroeconomic policy, \npublic investments, and economic reforms, Botswana has been among the fastest growing \neconomies in the last three decades and has a per capita income of $3,600 in 2003. It was \nranked  among  the  25  poorest  countries  in  the  world  in  the  mid-1960s.  Key  features  of \nBotswana\u2019s  macroeconomic  policy  included  (i)  smoothing  out  spending  resource  revenues \nrather than spending all as it comes; (ii) aligning expenditures with conservative, long-term \nforecasts  of  resource  revenues;  (iii)  saving  some  portion  of  revenues  for  leaner  years  by \nestablishing a stabilization fund and a public debt service fund to ensure it can meet debt \nobligations in case the resource boom busts; (iv) a balanced expenditure program between \nrecurrent and capital expenditures; and (v) investing in infrastructure, especially in rural areas \nwhere the majority of the population lives. Given the current global environment, it has become \npertinent for the Government to develop a resource revenue management strategy.  \n \n14.  Issue 4: Maintaining debt sustainability. Public debt as a share of GDP has been \ndeclining  but  remains  high.  At  the  end  of  2007,  the  stock  of  external  public  and  publicly \nguaranteed debt was estimated at 60% of GDP. Concessional borrowing from ADB and the \nWorld Bank accounts for the bulk of the increase in public debt since 2001. The stock of \ndomestic public debt is small at 1.5% of GDP. Recent IMF\u2013World Bank debt sustainability \nanalysis  continues  to  show  the  debt  stock  well  above  policy-based  indicative  thresholds, \nsuggesting a high risk of debt distress.3 Debt sustainability depends on sustained economic \ngrowth, as well as improved external competitiveness and largely concessional borrowing and \ngrants. Strong control over quasi-fiscal risks arising from the state sector will also be necessary, \nincluding guarantees for resource sector projects.  \n \n15.  The Government has outlined a strategy to support a sustainable adjustment in fiscal \npolicy over the next few years with technical assistance supported by development partners:   \n(i)  Continue to implement reforms to enhance the revenue system by broadening \nthe tax base through the introduction of value-added tax, replacing the turnover \ntax. In 2005, the Government passed a new tax law that widened the tax base \nand increased receipts from large projects and tourism.  \n(ii)  Addressing  problems  associated  with  fragmented  tax  administration.  The \nGovernment has made progress in returning tax collection functions (Treasury \nand Customs) under the jurisdiction of the central Government and clarifying the \ntax revenue sharing between the central and provincial governments.

The sector analysis updates the performance of the private sector and provides the \nbackground to identification of issues, constraints, and threats and the Government\u2019s priority \nreforms in support of development and growth of the private sector and small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs).1   \n \nA.   Background  \n  \n2.  The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has experienced robust growth and \ndevelopment in the last 5 years. From 2003 to 2008, economic growth has averaged around \n7.1%, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased by over 40% to $669 in 2007. \nBased on the national poverty line, poverty incidence declined to an estimated 28% during the \nsame period, and poverty reduction accelerated after 2004 when per capita income surpassed \n$400 in 2004. The economic growth has been supported mainly by the industrial sector, with \ninvestments in hydropower and the mining sector driving industrial expansion in recent years\u2014\nmaking  the  Lao  PDR  vulnerable  to  volatile  and  unpredictable  commodity  price  cycles \n(Figure A6.1).  The  manufacturing  sector  has  enjoyed  robust  growth  rates,  although  the \ngarments sector\u2014the major manufacturing export sector\u2014has experienced a decline in exports \nin recent years. The service sector has also enjoyed growth. Within services, tourism and \nrelated services have enjoyed rapid expansion in recent years\u2014international visitors to the \nLao PDR continue to increase, with over 1.6 million people traveling in 2007, generating over \n$200 million in revenues. Most of the recorded tourist arrivals are for short-term stays (1\u20133 \ndays) from neighboring economies. More recently, there has been an increased number of \nforeign investments in the agriculture sector, especially large-scale commercial plantations.  \n \n3.  The Lao PDR economy has undergone significant structural transformation since 1990, \nbut the export sector remains narrowly based\u2014with the resource sector (copper, gold, electricity, \nand timber) accounting for 70% of the total exports recorded through customs (Figure A6.1). \nThe economic transformation is reflected in the expansion of the industrial sector relative to the \nagriculture and services sectors. Industry as a share of GDP has increased from about 16% of \nGDP in 1990 to 23% in 2000 and 33% in 2008, with investments in hydropower and the mining \nsector  the  engine  of  growth.  Agriculture\u2019s  share  of  GDP  is  declining,  while  services  have \nremained relatively stable at about 26% of GDP. This pattern of structural change is expected \nas  an  economy  grows  and  develops;  resources  move  from  low  productivity  activities  in \nsubsistence agriculture and traditional services to higher productivity activities in industry and \nmodern services. This process, and the associated rural\u2013urban migration that occurs with this \ntransformation, has contributed to the reduction in poverty in the Lao PDR.   \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The sector analysis benefited from several reports on the private sector in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR).

The  SME  sector  dominates  economic  activity  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  accounts  for \nsubstantial employment. According to the latest available data from the 2006 industrial census, \n ", "54  Appendix 6 \nthere are 126,913 enterprises, of which 124,000 (97.6%) are small enterprises employing less \nthan 10 workers (Table 6A.1). Another 2,835 firms employ 10\u201399 workers and 198 firms employ \n100 or more workers. Sixty-four percent are operating in services, 19% in manufacturing and \n3.4%  in  agriculture.  More  than  half  the  enterprises  are  concentrated  around  the  capital \nVientiane and the north, with 32% enterprises residing in central Lao PDR; 15% reside in the \nsouth.  About  40%  of  firms  have  a  registration  certificate  and  70%  reported  having  a  tax \ncertificate.  The  majority  of  SMEs  are  unregistered,  primarily  because  of  the  high  cost, \ncumbersome procedures, and lack of transparency in the registration process. An ADB red tape \nstudy reported that it costs about $112 per firm to comply with registration procedures alone, \nand firms had to reregister every year. Business compliance costs more than quadruple when \nthe operation license from the sector ministry and the tax certificate from the Ministry of Finance \nare  added.  These  licenses  are  more  burdensome  on  SMEs  than  larger  firms  when \nbenchmarked against compliance costs per worker.  \n \nTable A6.1: Lao PDR Economic Census 2006:  \nEnterprise Size and Location of Primary Economic Units \nEnterprise Size  Economic Units  Location  Economic Units \n  No. % Provinces  No.  %\nLess than 5 employees  118,592 93.4 Vientiane Capital City  28,784  22.7\n5\u20139 employees  5,268 4.2 North   38,017  30.0\n10\u201399 employees  2,835 2.2 Central   40,551  32.0\n100+ employees  198 0.2 South   19,561  15.4\nTotal  126,913 100.0 Total  126,913  100.0\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nNote: Items may not add up to total as no detailed data were recorded for a few enterprises.  \nSource: Lao PDR, The Steering Committee on Economic Census 2007, Report of Economic Census, 2006 Volume 1, \nNational Statistics Centre, Vientiane Capital. \n \n5.  In the short term, the Lao PDR economy is affected by the collapse in commodity prices \nand the global recession. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that economic growth \nwill slow from 7.2% in 2008 to 4.5% in 2009 because of faltering garment exports, a fall in \nresource revenues, and a slowdown in foreign investments. In the longer term, the Lao PDR \neconomy will be challenged by the impact of the resource sector on the competitiveness and \ngrowth of the non-resource sector. Notwithstanding the current slump in commodity prices, the \nGovernment anticipates significant future revenues to the budget from hydropower investments \nand mining in the form of taxes, royalties, and dividends over the next decade. The revenue \nflows provide the Lao PDR with a significant opportunity to finance its development goals, raise \nper  capita  incomes,  and  reduce  poverty  (as  the  diamond  boom  did in  Botswana,  another \nlandlocked  economy).  At  the  same  time,  there  are  important  lessons  from  international \nexperience  for  the  Lao  PDR  in  supporting  private  sector  growth  when  there  is  a  large \ncommodity resource sector. A resource boom\u2014like the one experienced from 2006 to 2008\u2014\ncan  affect  the  growth  conditions  of  the  non-resource  sector  if  it  leads  to  an  \u201cexcessive\u201d \nappreciation of the real exchange rate. An excessive appreciation of the exchange rate may \nslow growth of the non-resource tradable goods sector (manufacturing and agriculture). The \nmanufacturing  sector  (especially  garments)  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  an  excessive  real \nappreciation. Unit labor costs in the Lao PDR garment sector are on a par with Cambodia and \nother neighbors.2 However, the sector operates on relatively lower profit margins, and since \nwages are paid in kip, an excessively appreciated exchange rate would raise unit labor costs in \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2007. Survey of Issues in Trade Policy and institutions Affecting SME Competitiveness in Lao PDR. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 6  55\nUS dollar terms\u2014squeezing profit margins. Updated estimates of the real kip exchange rate \nindicate that it has appreciated faster than its neighbors from 2006 to 2009, although there is no \ndefinitive evidence that this has hurt the competitiveness of the non-resource sector to date.  \n \n6.  The experiences of Indonesia and Botswana show that modest appreciation can be \nsuccessfully managed and can be consistent with growth of the non-resource sector. The critical \nlessons from these two countries include the following: (i) fiscal discipline (guarding against \ninflationary pressures from excessive spending of resource revenues in the domestic economy), \n(ii) promoting  a  balanced  public  expenditure  program,  (iii)  maintaining  a  conservative  debt \nstrategy, and (iv) promoting business climate reforms and investments to raise productivity in \nthe  tradable  sector.  The  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  followed  some  of  these  good \npractices\u2014it invested in irrigation projects in 1998 and 1999, which has boosted agriculture \nproductivity, and it reduced transaction costs in doing business. ADB and other donors are \nproviding assistance to raise productivity in the agriculture sector. However, the Government \ndoes not have a strategy for managing resource revenues and much more needs to be done to \nenhance  efficiency  in  trade  facilitation.  Recent  external  developments  also  highlight  that \nsustainable high growth will require diversification of the sources of growth beyond the resource \nsector, garments, and tourism. This will also reduce the Lao PDR\u2019s vulnerability to external \neconomic shocks. \n \n7.  Investment surveys and several recent value-chain studies have identified impediments \nto  the  Lao  PDR  realizing  its  medium-term  growth  potential  and  economic  diversification. \nSurveys on business climate perceptions suggest that the following, among other factors, are \nmajor obstacles to private sector growth and development: regulatory uncertainty and excessive \nred tape, remaining distortions in the trade regime, and inadequate skills of the labor force. \nValue-chain studies identify poor product quality, an inadequate sanitary and phyto-sanitary \nstandards (SPS) policy framework, underdeveloped links between the rural and modern sectors \nof the economy, and relatively costly logistics as constraints to export diversification. A common \nthread in many of these investment and value-chain studies is the Lao PDR\u2019s weak competition \npolicy framework\u2014broadly defined to include remaining distortions at the border (non-tariff \nbarriers)  and  behind  the  border  (technical  barriers  to  trade  and  industry  regulation,  and \ninvestment incentives). State-owned enterprises (SOEs) remain dominant in several key sectors \nof  the  economy,  and  this  tends  to  undermine  competition  and  economic  efficiency.  The \nGovernment\u2019s approach to SOE reform was first to privatize enterprises in the 1980s and early \n1990s. It is considering a new round of privatizations through partial listings of state enterprises \non the stock market once it is established after 2010.  \n \nB.   Medium-Term Growth Issues \n \n8.  This section summarizes the key business climate impediments to private sector growth \nand economic diversification. While much progress has been made in creating an enabling \nenvironment for the private sector to grow in the Lao PDR, much more needs to be done to \nlower transaction costs by addressing excessive red tape, improving the investment climate, \ncompleting the unfinished trade policy agenda, improving trade facilitation, and strengthening \nthe institutional framework for SME policy making.  \n \n9.  Transaction costs for doing business in the Lao PDR are high, but much lower than they \nwere in the 1990s. The Lao PDR continues to rank low in several international surveys of \ncompetitiveness  because  of  high  transaction  costs  in  the  regulatory  environment,  trade \nfacilitation, and an undeveloped logistics sector. The 2007 World Bank report on trade logistics \nshows that trade facilitation costs in the Lao PDR are high on a regional and international \n ", "56  Appendix 6 \ncomparison. The ADB-World Bank Investment Climate Survey of enterprises carried out in 2005 \nreported  several  major  constraints  in  the  Lao  PDR:  infrastructure,  regulation,  taxation, \nmacroeconomic stability, and access to finance. The German Agency for Technical Cooperation \n(GTZ) enterprise survey of 2007 (footnote 1), which is a follow-on to its 2005 benchmark survey, \nprovides information about changes in perceptions or wareness about business constraints. It \nfinds that business reported increased problems in 2007 with access to capital; finding skilled \ntechnical  labor,  accountants,  and  management;  access  to  technology  and  business \ndevelopment service providers; and increased fees and regulations.  \n \nFigure A6.2: Enterprises Identifying Problem as \u201cMajor\u201d Constraint to Growth \n \n(a) % of enterprises reporting as major constraint       (b) Change in % of enterprises reporting factor as  \n                 major constraint from 2007 to 2005 \n60\n25\n50\n20\n40\n15\n30\n10\n20\n10 5\n0 0\ncapitalAccess to regulationsFees and environmentCompetition Skilled labor Accountants informationMarket technologyAccess to Infrastructure Management    -5 capitalAccess to Skilled labor Accountants Management technologyAccess to regulationsFees and Market info Infrastructure Competition   \n  Source: GTZ. 2007. Enterprise Survey of 2007, Vientiane.  \n \n10.  Fees and licenses. The 2009 ADB red tape study estimates that firms on average incur \n$483 annually to comply with the three most common licenses\u2014the enterprise registration \ncertificate, sector operational license, and the tax certificate. Overall, it costs the business \ncommunity $36 million to comply with the three licenses. Depending on the sector, firms will \nrequire additional licenses and a realistic estimate of the business compliance costs was 1.5%\u2013\n3.0% of GDP in 2008. The report also showed that red tape costs vary across sectors, with the \npharmaceutical (production and retail) and tourism sectors having relatively high cost regulatory \nsystems.  Foreign  and  domestic  investors  requesting  fiscal  incentives  must  also  obtain  an \ninvestment license from the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) under the investment \nlaws. The process is unpredictable, as sector ministries are able to attach additional conditions \nbefore the investment license is approved. The cost of red tape has deterred entrepreneurs \nfrom  formalizing  their  businesses,  with  only  40%  of  total  enterprises  reportedly  having  an \nenterprise registration certificate. To address the red tape, international practice takes a two-\nstep approach: (i) review the existing stock of regulations, estimate its compliance costs to \nbusinesses and the economy, and produce a reform strategy; and (ii) later institutionalize a \nregulatory impact assessment (or review) mechanism designed to screen and monitor future red \ntape issuances. Posting regulations and impact assessments on the relevant ministry's website \nhelps  improve  transparency  in  the  regulatory  regime.  In  August  2008,  the  Government \nimplemented the new registration system, which reduced compliance costs by 35% and saved \nthe business community at least $6 million in compliance costs from not having to renew the \nregistration certificate every year.  \n ", "Appendix 6  57\n11.  Competition policy. The ADB red tape study focused on the business compliance costs \nof  obtaining  licenses  and  permits.  Other  important  costs  of  the  regulatory  regime  are  the \nadjustment costs firms have to undertake to comply with regulations and the economy-wide \nimpact of regulations. A common thread of many of the investment climate and value chain \nstudies is the Lao PDR\u2019s weak competition policy framework (para. 7). Three factors affect the \nnature and level of competition in several sectors. First, the presence of SOEs in the economy \nis widespread, and they are dominant in several sectors in manufacturing and utilities. Many of \nthese SOEs have loosely defined public service obligations that can affect their commercial \noperations and efficiency levels in the sector. Second, the investment incentives regime is very \ngenerous  on  an  international  comparison,  and  lacks  transparency.  Incentives  vary  across \nsectors, regions, and in some instances even among firms in the same sector as the incentives \npackage appears to be custom-made for some investors. This incentives regime has created \nprice distortions and provides an un-level playing field for firms. Third, while most industry \nregulations restricting competition have been eliminated, pockets of industry are provided with \nprotection or supported by anticompetitive regulations (such as in cement).   \n \n12.  Trade policy. Compared to other countries, the Lao PDR\u2019s most favored nation import \nduty rate is relatively low\u2014at a simple average of 10%\u2014although dispersion is relatively high, \nwith duties ranging from 0% to 40%. The effective tariff rate is lower if various duty exemptions \nare included, and when implementation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nFree  Trade  Area  (AFTA)  tariff  schedule  commitments  is  achieved.  The  import\u2013export \nmanagement system and import controlled list imposes time-consuming administrative costs on \nimporters and producers, as well as providing some protection to domestic industries. The \nestimates of effective rates of protection (ERPs)\u2014which measure the extent to which trade \npolicy  has  raised  prices  above  international  ones\u2014are  relatively  low  although  pockets  of \nsignificant protection to industry still exist in food and beverages, metal products, and some \nchemicals. The ERP estimates also indicate that the trade policy regime is biased against \nsectors with potential for export of goods (agriculture, textiles, and garments) as reflected in \nsubstantial negative protection to these sectors. The Government is making significant progress \nin improving trade policy, such as the recent revisions to the import licensing decree (and \ndistinguishing between automatic and non-automatic licensing), the reduced controlled list, and \nongoing revisions to the import\u2013export management decree. \n \n13.  Trade facilitation. Trade facilitation is still relatively costly, but it is improving. With large \ninvestments in road networks and infrastructure, and the cross-border transit agreement (CBTA) \nwith Thailand, the cost of trucking goods in terms of delivery time and cost per unit has falling in \nthe last several years. According to a recent TNT report,3 it now takes 4 hours to truck goods \nfrom the Viet Nam border to the Thai border via the East\u2013West Economic Corridor. However, \nproblems remain with transportation and trade facilitation. The local truck industry does not \nappear to be competitive, and is characterized by poor vehicle standards and breakdowns. The \nhigh cost of the local truck industry is partly offset by the Lao PDR authorities permitting trucks \nfrom neighboring countries to enter the Lao PDR, also cutting costs. There is lack of access of \nLao PDR vehicles of good quality to neighboring countries. The time involved in trade facilitation, \nespecially  through  customs,  remains  costly.  Pre-clearance  is  required  at  Savannaket,  and \noriginal  copies  must  be  sent  to  customs  at  the  border  at  Dansawan,  involving  a  2-day \nprocessing time. According to the TNT report, the new bridge has only saved 45 minutes \nbecause  of  hassle  with  customs.  Another  problem  identified  by  the  study  is  the  lack  of \ndistribution consolidation points along the border, which would be particularly helpful for SME \nexporters to store their products while in transit. Problems of trade facilitation particularly hurt \n                                                 \n3 ACMECS. 2007. Cross Border Transport and Trucking, ACMECS. \n ", "58  Appendix 6 \nSMEs as they export small quantities of products, so the fixed costs of trade facilitation account \nfor a higher proportion of FOB export prices than for larger firms. Governments of member \nstates in the GMS are addressing some of these trade facilitation problems4 by implementing \nthe CBTA, as well as reforming customs.  \n  \n14.  Trade  logistics.  The  performance  of  trade  logistic  services  is  critical  to  determine \nwhether the Lao PDR can trade goods and services on time and at low costs. A cross-country \nstudy conducted by the World Bank5 suggests that high logistics costs and, more importantly, a \nlow level of services are barriers to trade and hence, growth. Available indicators suggest that \nLao PDR businesses bear a higher cost of logistics than other countries in the region. The \nlogistics performance index ranks the Lao PDR 117 out of 150 countries in the survey, meaning \nit is less efficient. This index is developed based on a comprehensive survey of supply chain \nperformance, including customs procedures, logistic costs, infrastructure quality, timeliness of \nreaching destination, and the competence of the domestic logistics industry. The Lao PDR was \nranked 146 in domestic logistic costs, 139 in tracking and tracing, 121 in customs efficiency, and \n121 in infrastructure cost. In comparison, Thailand is ranked 31, Indonesia 43, Viet Nam 53, the \nPhilippines 65, and Cambodia 81.   \n \n15.  Sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards. SPSs are key to microeconomic infrastructure, \nimproving the private sector\u2019s access to the international market for agro-based products. The \nLao PDR SPS management system is in its infancy. Lack of resources and technical expertise \nmean that development of minimum standards for food and beverages is weak, especially \namong SMEs. The Government has a broad SPS action plan, although it needs to be reviewed \nin  light  of  the  Government\u2019s  progress  in  preparing  for  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) \naccession. The Government recognizes that much needs to be done to improve SPSs, including \n(i)  strengthening  the  SPS  framework  for  effective  SPS  management;  (ii)  improving  SPS \nregulations related to food, water, and agro-processed products; (iii) establishing coordination \nprocesses  and  procedures  for  notifying  WTO  on  SPS  regulations  and  other  TBTs,  and \nestablishing inquiry points within the Government; (iv) ensuring competition within the domestic \nmarket SPS providers, auditors, and assessors; and (v) capacity development for effective \nmanagement  systems,  such  as  upgrading  of  laboratories,  assisting  with  the  laboratories\u2019 \nInternational  Organization  for  Standardization  accreditation  so  that  tests  are  internationally \nrecognized, procuring equipment and rapid diagnostic tools, and training staff. An ADB GMS \ntrade facilitation project is considering ways to assist GMS member states with SPS capacity \nbuilding to enable cross-border trade while adequately protecting the health of crops, livestock, \nand consumers. It is intended to develop an action plan with investment projects based around \nfour areas: (i) developing a risk-based system of border handling; (ii) strengthening regional and \nnational capacities for diagnostic and testing facilities; (iii) promoting private sector capacities for \nfood safety compliance; and (iv) promoting academic training needed for managing SPSs.  \n \n16.

The  rankings  reflect  a  range  of  factors,  including  outdated  laws  and  regulations \n(e.g., bankruptcy law), weak capacity and independence of the courts, frequent staff rotations, \nand lack of case precedence, as well as cultural and institutional factors inhibiting recourse to \nlegal means to enforce contracts in a closely knit, consensus-based society (reflected by the low \nnumber of foreclosure cases filed in relation to nonperforming loans, and the time and tedious \nprocesses involved in resolving such cases). \n \n18.  ADB has provided support for capacity building in the judiciary and the development of \nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms (e.g., the Banking Sector Reform Program). However, \nthe impact of these measures has been limited, partly because of the ad hoc and stand-alone \napproach adopted. Based on experience and lessons learned from these as well as ADB \ninterventions in other countries, legal and judicial reform often require deep-seated institutional \nchanges, including public financial management reforms and increased resources to the judicial \nsector, if they are to lead to meaningful and lasting results. This means that systematic and \nsustained engagement as well as political will are required over the longer term. \n \n19.  The Government has outlined a strategy to reduce transaction costs in doing business, \nsupported by the PSME program cluster and the post-program monitoring framework:  \n(i)  Under  Subprogram  1  of  the  PSME,  the  Government  enacted  the  Law  on \nEnterprises of 2006 which promised to streamline registration procedures and \nintroduce a negative list of sectors restricted to enterprise registration. Under \nsubprogram  2,  the  Government  implemented  the  enterprise  law\u2014including \nmaking  effective  the  new,  simplified  enterprise  registration  process  with  a \nnegative list; and establishment of enterprise registration offices with internet \nlinks between the central office and pilot provinces. The Government intends to \ncomplete the rollout of the enterprise registry offices by the end of 2009.  \n(ii)  The Government has drafted a new law on investment that provides national \ntreatment for foreign and domestic investors, and synchronizes the investment \nlists with the negative list under the enterprise law.  \n(iii)  Under subprogram 1, the Government\u2014with ADB assistance\u2014drafted the SME \nstrategy and it was approved in early 2008. The Government is making progress \ntoward  implementing  its  SME  strategy,  including  regulatory  reform  and \ntransparency, capacity development of the SME sector, etc.    \n(iv)  The Government is chipping away at the import\u2013export management system. In \n2006, to improve transparency, it reclassified goods on the import controlled list \naccording to harmonized codes. In 2007, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce \n(MOIC) issued a notice removing trade officials from the customs border posts, \nand abolished the requirement that producers/importers must have an import \nplan  for  the  year.  Most  recently,  it  revised  the  import  licensing  decree  and \ndistinguishes  between  automatic  and  non-automatic  licenses  consistent  with \nWTO rules, reduced the number of items on the controlled list, and is drafting \nrevisions  to  the  import\u2013export  management  decree,  including  trading  rights, \nconsistent with WTO rules. \n(v)  The  Government  (MOIC)  has  started  a  regulatory  reform  process,  including \nestablishing an interagency taskforce to advocate the introduction of regulatory \nimpact assessments and pilot test a regulatory impact assessment at MOIC. To \nimprove transparency in regulations and procedures, the SME Promotion and \nDevelopment  Office  (SMEPDO)  upgraded  its  website  and  started  posting \nbusiness  regulations  on  its  website,  as  well  as  elaborating  on  registration \nprocedures.  \n ", "60  Appendix 6 \n20.  Going  forward,  a  second  generation  of  reforms  should  focus  on  completing \nimplementation of the SME strategy; implementing a regulatory review process within national \nGovernment  that  promotes  better  quality  regulations  and  promotes  competition;  enhancing \ntrade facilitation measures in customs, logistics and SPS; and preparing for implementing WTO \ncommitments once Lao PDR accedes to the WTO, planned for 2012.  \n \n \n ", " \nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT   \n \nThe PSME will contribute to sustainable reduction in poverty in the short and medium term through (i) an increase in investment and the number of enterprises; (ii) the \nlabor market, with increased hiring activity across most sectors; and (iii) lower prices of tradable goods through increased integration within the region and rest of the \nworld through trade policy reforms.  \n \nChannel of Effect  Effects on the Poor \nGeneral  Specific  Direct Short Term  Indirect Short Term  Medium Term  Mitigation or Enhancement Measures \nInvestment Foreign and  Increase in investment  Foreign investment will  Foreign investment will  Implementation of the enterprise law reduces the costs of \ndomestic  will support economic  create linkages with local  create technology  enterprise registration and opens up new opportunities for \ninvestment  growth   suppliers and further  spillovers through labor  entrepreneurs.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR): \nThe Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program Cluster (PSME) focuses on three \npolicy areas: (i) institutional development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) policy and access to finance, \n(ii) a strengthened investment climate, and (iii) trade policy and capacity building. The PSME policy areas correspond \nwith those of the Government as spelled out in the Sixth Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan, \n2006\u20132010, which focuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth, including fostering SMEs; (ii) providing basic social \nservices; (iii) stronger human security; (iv) enhanced participation by the poor; and (v) developing the poorest regions. \nThe SEDP6 has several crosscutting issues relevant to the PSME, including (i) private sector development through a \nstable macro-economy, creating an enabling environment for businesses, and promoting foreign direct investment; \nand (ii) regional integration, including reducing trade barriers, promoting cross-border investments and economic \ncorridors, membership of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \nand the World Trade Organization (WTO). The SEDP6 mission is to reduce the poverty rate from 33% in 2003 to 23% \nby 2015.  \n \nPrivate sector development and growth is crucial for sustained poverty reduction, as it will be the major generator of \njobs and incomes in the future. This is vital as almost 50% of the population is under the age of 20 years, and over \n80% of employment is in informal activities (mainly subsistence agriculture). Removing regulatory constraints to the \nprivate sector to invest and create new businesses is crucially important. The regulatory transaction costs are more \nburdensome on SMEs, and they constrained dynamic growth of SMEs by keeping most of them informal. Indicative of \nthe burden on SMEs, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) red tape study shows that the annual average cost of \ncompliance with licenses and permits amounts to about $25 per employee in micro and small enterprises compared \nwith $3 per employee in large firms (100 or more employees). The Government has modernized the business law \nthrough the enactment of the enterprise law in 2006, which makes it easier to register a business and open sectors up \nfor new enterprises to invest in by issuing the negative list (people can invest in any sector except for those included \non the negative list). Other reforms include drafting a new investment law that provides for national treatment for all \ninvestors, and reducing the nontransparent forms of non-tariff measures to improve productivity and allow SMEs to \naccess inputs at lower prices.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nThe poverty incidence dropped from 46% in 1992 to 33% in 2003, as the economy expanded 6%\u20138% per annum for \nmost of this period, and it is estimated at 28% in 2008. Improved rice production and rising overseas remittances have \nalso helped reduce poverty. The Government targets a poverty rate of 23% by 2015, assuming economic growth \ncontinues in the current range of 7%. An assessment of poverty implications of the PSME indicates that on balance, \nthe PSME program will contribute to a reduction in the incidence of poverty by lowering the transaction costs of doing \nbusiness. A reduction in red tape and other regulatory compliance costs would induce additional SME start-ups and \ntherefore additional investment and employment. The recent reforms to enterprise registration show that 5,000 small \nfirms have registered for the first time. Obtaining the registration certificate formalizes them and helps open access to \nformal sector funding. Reform of the non-tariff measures will lower the prices of several industrial commodities, which \nin turn will support industrial expansion and jobs. Lower prices will ultimately be passed to households/consumers.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nHowever, as part of the PSME process, consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector, civil society groups, and development partners. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  65\n \n \nD.  Gender Development  \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  The PSME has had indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on \nreducing the transaction costs of doing business. The improved investment climate will steadily increase the number \nof SMEs.
