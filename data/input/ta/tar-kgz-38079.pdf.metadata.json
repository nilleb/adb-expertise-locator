In December 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in consultation with the Ministry \nof Agriculture, Water Resources and Processing Industry (MAWRPI) initiated a concept paper to \nundertake  a  study  of  the  impact  of  land  reform  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  paper  was \nsubsequently supported for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. A Fact-Finding \nMission that visited the Kyrgyz Republic on 15 March\u20132 April 2004 to formulate the technical \nassistance (TA) reached an understanding with the Government on the goal, purpose, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference \nfor the TA.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a predominantly agricultural economy, with the agriculture sector \ncontributing in 2002 more than a third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, 11% of the \neconomy\u2019s  export  earnings,  and  52%  of  total  employment.  About  66%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation live in the rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Since 1996, \nagriculture has contributed significantly to economic recovery, growing at an average annual \nrate of about 7.4% (1996\u20132002) compared with 4.7% for the economy as a whole.  \n \n3.  Structural reforms in the sector have helped agriculture to recover. The land reform and \nfarm restructuring reforms introduced in 1993 were some of the key measures that seem to \nhave stimulated agricultural growth in the second half of the 1990s. In Central Asia, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  was  the  forerunner  in  land  reform  and  farm  restructuring  legislation  and \nimplementation. The reform measures, implemented through several phases, comprised the \nprivatization  of  state  and  collective  farms  into  privately  owned  farms,  establishment  of \ninstitutions  to  support  the  process,  and  introduction  of  a  market-oriented  land  market. \nPrivatization of the former state and collective farms is almost complete. Of the country\u2019s arable \nland, 75% has been reallocated. About 243,294 private peasant and individual farmers are using \n752,656 hectares (ha) (Agriculture Census, 2002). Land legislation and land-related institutions \nat  national  and  local  government  levels  are  undergoing  transformation  to  facilitate  the \ndecentralization of land management at the oblast (region), raion (district), and aiyl okmotu \n(village) levels; facilitate land market development; and implement a land registration system. \n \n4.  According to the Agricultural Census (2002), of 1,038,997 farms with arable land of \n1,306,786 ha, 85.1% are less than 1 ha; 23% are peasant or individual farms holding 57.6% of \narable land (average size 3.09 ha); and 76.4% are individual (household) plots holding 4.9% of \narable land (average size 0.08 ha). These farms grow essentially subsistence crops as they \nhave little scope for agriculture improvement. Aside from the large number of small farm plot \nowners, other production arrangements have emerged because of land reform. They vary in \nland size and farm management, and hence have different production needs for growth. \n \n5.  Implementation  of  the  land  reform  program  continues  and  considerable  challenges \nremain. A recent study2 identified five major areas of concern: (i) the allocation, use, and local \npublic management of the Land Redistribution Fund (LRF);3 (ii) lack of a pastureland policy \n                                                 \n1\n  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 February 2004. \n2\n  Childress, M., R. Giovarelli, R. Shimarov, and K. Tilekeyev. 2003. Rapid Appraisal of Land Reform in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic (Draft). Bishkek: ARD/Chechi Development of Commercial Law Project. \n3\n  In 1991, the Government established the Land Redistribution Fund (LRF), which set aside 25% of the country\u2019s \nagriculture  arable  land  for  the  control  of  the  local  aiyl  okmotu  (these  are  heads  of  local  geographic  and \nadministrative areas, consisting of 1\u201327 villages).  Land from the LRF is thus exempted from land reform and may ", "2 \nframework, the increasing public management role on pasturelands by local governments, and \nthe growing demand for pasturelands with the resurgence of the livestock sector; (iii) the need to \nassess the land market restrictions and property rights in terms of household land shares, family \nproperty, married women\u2019s rights to land ownership, and regional variations in lease rental \nmarkets; (iv) the need to accelerate the registration of farms and clarify technical issues; and (v) \nthe rise of land-related conflicts and how best to address these disputes. The land-related \ninstitutions  are  still  building  their  capacity  and  face  difficulties  in  meeting  the  demand  for \nservices at the same time as policy and legislation undergo amendment and harmonization. For \nexample,  having  previously  undertaken  the  registration  of  urban  properties,  GosRegister \nrecently began the registration of rural properties. Land-related institutions at the oblast, raion, \nand  aiyl  okmotu  levels  are  technically  ill-equipped  to  implement  land  reform,  and  local \ngovernments have limited understanding of the various land laws and policies. \n \n6.  Poverty incidence in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2002 was exemplified by 44.4% of the \npopulation living in absolute poverty and 13.8% living in extreme poverty.4 Poverty incidence in \nrural areas declined over 1998\u20132001 largely due to the better performance of the agriculture \nsector. However, rural poverty continues to be significantly higher than urban poverty: About two \nthirds of the population living in rural areas comprise about three quarters of the poor people \n(2001).  There  are  significant  regional  differences  in  poverty:  Naryn  oblast  has  the  highest \nincidence of poverty, followed by Talas, the three southern oblasts of Jalal-Abad, Osh, and \nBatken,  and  the  northern  oblast  of  Issyk-Kul;  the  least  poor  area  is  Chui  oblast.  Another \nimportant feature of poverty is that the majority of the population live very close to the margin \nbetween poor and non-poor, thus creating a significant degree (about 39% in 2001) of transient \npoverty. \n \n7.  The aid community and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have played a major role \nin  assisting  the  Government  in  formulating  and  modifying  policy  and  legislation  and  in \nimplementing the land reform program. Key support has come from the World Bank through the \nAgriculture Support Services Project (ASSP) and the Real Estate and Registration Projects, and \nfrom  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  through  the  Legal \nInfrastructure for a Market Economy,  Kyrgyz Land Reform, and Legal Assistance to Rural \nCitizens (with Helvetas) projects. Recent support from both international agencies and some \nNGOs has focused on legal advice to farmers in resolving their land disputes as well as public \ninformation campaigns to local governments and farmers. Systematic monitoring of land reform \nappears to be limited to ASSP, which has conducted farm surveys in 1999 and 2001, with the \n2003 survey currently under way. There have been other smaller and one-off surveys, often \nsupporting the specific objectives and focus of respective projects. \n \n8.  Neither the land reform process nor the impact of land reform has been systematically \nmonitored and assessed. Experience elsewhere indicates a strong causal relationship between \nlandownership  (through  land  reform)  and  agriculture  growth,  primarily  through  increased \nproductivity of smaller farms relative to large farms. Small farm owners who benefited from land \nreform often invest in land improvements and use quality inputs as well as increase labor \nintensity. Poverty incidence among land reform beneficiaries also tends to decline. Secure rights \nto land have likewise been linked to fostering environmental stewardship and use of sustainable \n                                                 \nbe used to expand rural settlements, or for seed-growing, pedigree breeding, experimental farms, and other state-\nrun variety testing institutions. It was also intended for individuals who had a right to land during the initial allocation \nof land but did not receive any land.   \n4\n  In 2002, the Government\u2019s absolute poverty threshold, which used an expenditure approach definition, was \nSom7,491 per annum, while the extreme poverty threshold was Som4,510 (World Bank. 2003. Kyrgyz Republic: \nEnhancing Pro-poor Growth. Washington, DC). ", "    3 \nfarm practices. However, other studies also showed that the positive impact of land reform on \nagriculture growth, poverty reduction, and environment may be short-lived unless these one-\ntime effects of land reform are accompanied with complementary institutional and additional \nlegislative  reforms,  the  establishment  of  input  markets,  and  development  of  market-  and \nproductivity-enhancing  infrastructure  facilities.  Similarly,  ad  hoc  studies  done  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, which use cross-sectional data, reflect the same short-term beneficial effects of land \nreform. However, there is a dearth of comprehensive analysis that looks at the processes and \ntheir  implications  for  further  poverty  reduction,  increased  productivity,  and  sustainable \nenvironmental development.  \n \n9.  A comprehensive study of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s land reform program is considered \ntimely. The study can review the process from its origin, particularly the evolution of the policy, \nlegislation, and institutions; and assess their impact on agricultural growth, poverty, and the \nenvironment. Such a study will assist the Government in the next phase of the program, which \nwill see a consolidation of policy, legislation, and institutions. This phase should ensure the \npositive contribution of the reformed lands to sustainable agriculture and rural development, \nreduction  in  poverty,  and  improved  environmental  practices.  The  study  will  provide \nrecommendations on the Government's next agenda for action. At the same time, the study will \nbe useful to other transition economies, especially the Central Asian countries, by identifying the \nmajor lessons learned and good practice in formulating and implementing an efficient and \neffective land reform program. The study will also provide a basis for ADB and other sources of \naid  to  incorporate  relevant  recommendations in  future  technical  assistance  and investment \nprojects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The goal of the TA is to implement a more efficient and effective land reform program in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and other transition economies. Its purpose is to assess the process and \nimpact of land reform on agricultural growth, poverty reduction, and the environment. The final \nreport including recommendations and lessons learned will be published. The outputs of the TA \ninclude (i) an assessment of the process of land reform; (ii) an assessment of the impact of land \nreform on agricultural growth, poverty reduction, and the environment; (iii) case studies in three \noblasts to identify good practices in implementation, participatory methods, gender aspects, and \nunderstanding of farmers' rights; and (iv) local and national workshops. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA is principally an analytical study of both the process and the impact of land \nreform on agriculture, poverty reduction, and the environment, especially pastures. The study \nwill employ a strong collaborative and participatory approach to ensure widespread involvement \nand agreement on the analysis and recommendations. This collaboration and participation will \nbe pursued through the establishment of a multi-stakeholder study coordination group, extensive \ngroup interviews, comprehensive and in-depth survey, several workshops at local and national \nlevels, and a final workshop involving international participants. \n \n12.  An  important  feature  of  the  study  will  be  the  emphasis  on  collaboration  between \ninternational and domestic consultants and resource personnel. This collaboration will be of \nmutual  benefit,  with  the  local  personnel  gaining  valuable  knowledge  and  experience  in  a \nrigorous and systematic study and the international consultants gaining understanding of the ", "4 \nlocal social, cultural, and institutional contexts. The framework of analysis will be in the political \neconomy and institutional economics context of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n13.  Essentially, the key activities will include \n \n(i)  reviews of key literature on land reform in relevant countries, the evolution of the \nprocess and key policy documents and legislation, the evolution of institutions in \nresponse to the changing policy and legislation environment and land reform \nimplementation  requirements,  the  role  of  all  stakeholders  in  formulating  and \nimplementing the land reform program, and available statistics and surveys; \n(ii)  a  systematic  assessment  of  impact  through  a  quantitative  and  qualitative \nanalysis. Where feasible use will be made of panel data from Agriculture Census \n2002, surveys under ASSP, and household budget survey for 2000, 2001, and \n2002. Additional quantitative and qualitative surveys will be undertaken in the \nthree  oblasts  of  Osh  representing  the  southern  area,  Chui  representing  the \nnorthern area, and Naryn representing the importance of pasturelands. All data \nand analysis will be disaggregated by gender, region, indigenous groups, where \nsignificant; and farm type (structure, ownership, and management); \n(iii)  preparation of case studies for each surveyed oblast of Chui, Naryn, and Osh to \nfocus on the common and specific attributes of the response in implementation of \nthe land reform program to the process and evolution of policy, legislation, and \ninstitutions; and \n(iv)  workshops at oblast and national levels, first, to understand key stakeholders' \nperceptions of the process and the impact; second, to obtain feedback on work in \nprogress; and third, to obtain consensus on the findings and recommendations of \nthe study. \n \n14.  The final step in the TA will be the publication of the study in the English and Russian \nlanguages,  with  a  summarized  version  in  Kyrgyz,  in  appropriate  forms  and  mediums  to \nmaximize its distribution. An outline of the study report is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $257,400 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $242,600  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $400,000 \nequivalent comprising the entire foreign exchange costs and $142,600 equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund and administered by ADB. The Government, through the provision of counterpart staff, \noffice space and facilities, data and documents, and participation of the study working group, will \nfinance in kind the remaining portion of the local currency costs equivalent to $100,000. In \naddition, MAWRPI will make available office equipment (computers, printers, photocopiers, and \nfacsimile machine) provided under TA 3439: Capacity Building for the Ministry of Agriculture, \nWater Resources and Processing Industry.5 Appendix 3 gives the cost and financing schedule. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Executing Agency will be MAWRPI. MAWRPI will form a study coordination group \nchaired by the first deputy minister with representatives from the Office of the Prime Minister, the \n                                                 \n5\n ADB. 2000.

Other study team members can observe the proceedings. Other relevant \nagencies can participate as required. The study coordination group will report to the minister of \nMAWRPI, and will meet regularly as required to provide feedback and guidance on the study \nprocess and working papers. The TA will be implemented over 18 months with an anticipated \nstart in December 2004. \n \n17.  Up to 12 person-months of international consulting services will be required (person-\nmonths are in parentheses), with expertise in land reform (team leader, 6), law (1.5), institutional \ndevelopment (1.5), agriculture and environment (1), social and gender development (1), and \nunallocated  (1).  Up  to  42  person-months  of  local  consulting  services,  as  required,  will  be \nrecruited with expertise in land reform and study coordination (deputy team leader, 12), law (6), \ninstitutional development (6), agricultural economics (6), social and gender development (6), \nand unallocated (6). The unallocated person-months will accommodate extensions of the above \nexpertise or recruitment of expertise identified in the course of the study. ADB will engage a \nresearch institute or firm in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Resource persons for \nspecial  short-term  studies  can  be  subcontracted  by  the  team  leader  to  augment  various \nassessments, using up to 6 person-months of domestic resource persons or experts on specific \ntopics identified to strengthen the study. A simplified technical proposal procedure using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method will be adopted for recruiting the research institute or \nfirm. Equipment purchased under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non Procurement.  \n \n18.  Workshops will be conducted at oblast and national levels to understand the perceptions \nof key stakeholders, obtain feedback on the study work in progress, and obtain consensus on \nthe findings and recommendations of the study. Six workshops will be held in the three oblasts \nand two national workshops will be held: one on stakeholder perceptions at the beginning, and \none on the findings and recommendations at the end of the study. \n \n19.  An inception report for the conduct of the study will be prepared at the end of the first \nmonth followed by a meeting of the study coordination group. Papers on work in progress will be \nprepared for the assessment of the process of land reform, the design and methodology of the \nquantitative and qualitative survey, the assessment of impact, the case studies, and the final \nreport. The timing for these working papers and consideration by the study coordination group \nwill be determined in consultation with the study team leader. Each quarter the team leader will \nsubmit to ADB and MAWRPI a progress report in English and Russian describing progress to \ndate against an agreed-upon study timetable, problems encountered and action taken, and \nanticipated problems or delays in the conduct of the study. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof the Kyrgyz Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund  for  A  Study  of  the  Impact  of  Land  Reform  on  Agriculture,  Poverty  Reduction,  and \nEnvironment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Monitoring   \nDesign Summary    Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  Assumptions \nGoal       \n       \nLand reform in the  Increases in agriculture  National statistics \nKyrgyz Republic and  productivity    \nother transition    Reports of \neconomies is  Increases in real  government and \nimplemented more  income of farms   aid agencies \nefficiently and     \neffectively  Effective mechanisms  Asian Development \n  to redress increasing  Bank (ADB) \n  degradation of  technical \nagriculture and  assistance (TA) \npastureland   and loan reports \n \nAdoption of good \npractices by other \ntransition economies, \nespecially in Central \nAsia \n \nPurpose       \n       \nThe process and impact  Endorsement of  TA review missions  The Government \nof land reform in the  recommendations by    supports efficient and \nKyrgyz Republic are  Government and key  Progress reports  effective dissemination \nassessed  stakeholders    and debate of TA \ncomprehensively and    TA Completion  recommendations \nrecommendations for  Publication of study in  Report  involving a wide range \nnecessary changes are  month 18    of stakeholders \nprovided  Published report  through participatory \nmanner. \n \nOutputs       \n       \n1.
