To sustain economic growth, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nattaches priority to the so-called Three Rural Issues (agriculture, rural areas, and farmers), \nwhich it identified as a focus for further economic and social development. A rural population of \n650 million that relies mostly on agriculture makes modernization of the agriculture sector a \ncritical development task.  \n \n2.  The PRC wishes to establish efficient logistics policies in rural areas to (i) enable an \nunimpeded bidirectional distribution channel for agricultural products and rural consumer goods \n(manufactured goods) and (ii) promote the development of the agriculture sector. The State \nCouncil issued the Logistics Industry Restructuring and Revitalization Plan1 in 2009, which \npinpoints the need to improve value chains for agricultural produce and circulation of consumer \ngoods through better logistics in rural areas. This technical assistance (TA) has been developed \nupon request from the Ministry of Transport (MOT). Through it, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will support the preparation of studies for strengthening rural and urban links in the PRC. \nThe TA will provide input for and interact with ADB\u2019s ongoing TA for the preparation of the \n13th Five-Year Plan with respect to Challenge 2: Rural Urban Transformation.2 Agreement has \nbeen  reached  on  TA  impact,  outcome,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates,  and \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Logistics  plays  an  important  role  in  agricultural  production  and  supply-chain \nmanagement, and is necessary to ensure food safety and quality. In developed countries, post-\nharvest product losses during processing, storage, and handling are generally small because of \nthe efficiency of the equipment, better storage facilities, and control of critical variables by skilled \nand trained staff. In the PRC, the loss rate for vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural products \nreaches 25%\u201330% in harvesting, transport, storage, and other parts of the logistics chain.4 The \nlack of organization and facilities throughout the agricultural value chains in the PRC is an \nimpediment to serving the growing urban markets. Improvements in rural logistics will help \nfarmers harvest and market crops more efficiently, increase the income they receive from selling \ntheir produce, and contribute to further economic integration of urban and rural areas.  \n \n4.  Logistics in rural areas of the PRC faces diverse and multifaceted hurdles given the \ngeographical conditions, prevailing agricultural products, and the overall economic profile. The \ncountry\u2019s northeast is suitable for large-scale mechanized cultivation of agricultural crops, while \nthe southwest, especially the mountainous areas, is more suitable for specialty crops. Most \nparts of northern PRC can grow only one rice crop a year; southern PRC can grow two or three. \n \n5.  Continuing rapid urbanization is leading to significant changes in overall patterns of \nsettlement and socioeconomic activity, and in associated links between rural and urban areas. \nThis has led to a need for new measures to strengthen the role of rural logistics, including \n                                                \n1  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  State  Council.  2009.

Despite geographical differences, some problems affecting rural logistics are common \nacross  the  PRC.  These  include  (i)  inadequate  infrastructure,  (ii)  changing  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics of rural and urban areas due to rural\u2013urban migration, (iii) a lack of sophisticated \ninformation technology, (iv) underdevelopment of agricultural markets, and (v) a shortage of \nskilled workers. Transport systems are a particularly weak link because of (i) the inadequate \nand poor quality of the rural road network; (ii) a shortage of freight depots in rural areas, which \nhampers consolidation of agricultural products for shipment to other areas; and (iii) a lack of \nspecialized vehicles for the transport of agricultural products. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The  TA  will  assist  the  PRC  in  formulating  strategies  and  policies  to  improve  rural \nlogistics for inclusion in the 13th Five-Year Plan. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the PRC for 2011\u20132015,5 which seeks to foster balanced and equitable \ndevelopment  by  promoting  integrated  rural  and  urban  development  in  ways  that  expand \nlivelihood opportunities for the poor. The TA is also included in the PRC country operations \nbusiness plan, 2014\u20132016.6 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The expected impact will be greater efficiency and cost effectiveness of logistics in rural \nareas of the PRC. \n \n9.  A policy framework for rural logistics development in the 13th Five-Year Plan, along with \nother measures, guidelines, and action plans that can be adopted by MOT and provincial \ngovernments in the PRC are the proposed outcome of the TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The main outputs of the TA are described below. \n \n11.  Brief initial policy proposals on rural logistics for the 13th Five-Year Plan. This \ninvolves  an  assessment  of  the  key  drivers  of  rural  logistics  in  the  PRC  and  the  planned \ndevelopment up to 2025. The output also involves short reviews in up to three provinces to \ndevelop  initial  policy  proposals  for  improving  rural  logistics,  with  a  view  to  these  being \nincorporated in the 13th Five-Year Plan.7 The selection of the provinces will be based on a \nreview of existing national and provincial plans regarding transport and logistics development; \nan  assessment  of  the economic,  agricultural, geographic,  and  demographic  profiles  of the \nprovinces;  and  a  review  of  stakeholders  in  the  logistic  chains.  The  TA  will  evaluate  the \ninteraction and changing relationship between rural and urban areas of the country in terms of \nlogistics, and it will identify major bottlenecks in rural\u2013rural links. A workshop with national \nstakeholders and international and national resource persons will be held to discuss the initial \npolicy proposals and preparation of brief policy notes. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012.

Detailed policy proposals on rural logistics for the 13th Five-Year Plan. Further \nstudies in the selected provinces and consultation of research outputs from related studies and \nTA projects8 will help in preparing a detailed analysis of logistics systems in rural areas. The TA \nteam will also review the rural logistics in selected developed countries and point to international \nbest practices that are relevant to the PRC. The TA will conduct an international study and field \nvisit to a country that can provide examples of replicable agricultural logistic chains, such as \nJapan, the Republic of Korea, or the United States.9 The output will include a workshop with \nnational stakeholders and international and national resource persons to discuss the detailed \npolicy proposals. \n \n13.  Project  proposals in selected  provinces. This involves preparing transport sector \nguidelines and monitoring systems for improving rural logistics in selected provinces and/or \nagricultural markets. The TA team will assist MOT and provincial governments in formulating the \nrequired priority pilot projects and programs. This may entail new or amended regulations and \noperating guidelines, institutional changes, physical infrastructure improvements, organization of \nproduct and transport chains, budget allocation, information systems, market organization, and \nstrengthening of competition. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, suitably furnished office space with \nutilities and telecommunication access, workshop venues, information materials, data, maps \nand other documents, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.
