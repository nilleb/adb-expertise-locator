The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is necessary to support analysis \nand preparation of the program in accordance with the government\u2019s and Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) standards and expectations. Economical and technical feasibility and safeguard \nissues of high priority protection sites should be studied in preparation for tranche-1 subprojects. \nRequirements for the multitranche financing facility (MFF), such as a sector road map and \ninvestment plan should be reviewed and proposed. For institutional, operation and maintenance \nof infrastructure, and community-based disaster management aspects, existing capacity and \npractices need to be examined, and required measures which could be directed by the program \nshould be proposed.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will prepare a proposal for an MFF investment program that can lead to \nanticipated  sector  impacts  and  outcomes,  and  for  program  processing  documents  for  the \ngovernment  and  ADB.  The  PPTA  will  cover  feasibility  studies  for  tranche-1  subprojects, \npreparation of an MFF sector road map and overall program investment plan, institutional study, \nsafeguard assessments, implementation schedule, and development project proforma/proposal \n(DPP) preparation support.  \n \n3.
