INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional technical assistance (TA) program will support research and development to \nachieve  a  greater  understanding  of  the  commercialization  and  bankability  of  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs), across key markets in the Central and West Asia (CWA) region; and enhance \nSOEs\u2019 institutional capacity to access commercial financing from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and cofinanciers. The TA will focus on positioning ADB as a partner in driving forward the \nfinancial sustainability and commercialization of strategic SOEs, and in doing so enable more \nSOE-related commercially oriented investment opportunities in the region. This approach will pilot \nnew approaches such as credit mapping and innovative SOE 360\u00b0 reviews, as well as build the \ntools,  techniques,  and  teams  to  establish  and  implement  comprehensive  individual  SOE \ntransformation programs to support new and deeper engagements with SOEs.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its operational priority of strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity. It will promote greater commercial orientation of SOEs and \nhelp improve their access to financing on commercial terms and conditions by improving their \ngovernance and institutional capacity for service delivery through SOE reforms.1 The TA also \nresponds directly to Strategy 2030's target of expanding private sector operations, including \npreparing SOEs for accessing commercial financing under the One ADB approach, bringing \ntogether knowledge and expertise for the benefit of ADB's clients. In line with another operational \npriority of Strategy 2030\u2014accelerating progress in gender equality\u2014the TA incorporates some \ngender  elements  in  the  analysis  and  program  design  so  that  SOEs  will  contribute  to  the \nadvancement of gender equality. The TA is part of the approved 2021 TA pipeline of ADB\u2019s \nCentral and West Asia Department (CWRD).2 \n \n3.  The TA supports Sustainable Development Goal 16.6 (develop effective, accountable, \nand transparent institutions at all levels) and Sustainable Development Goal 8.10 (strengthen the \ncapacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance, \nand financial services for all) by promoting the financial sustainability and commercialization of \nSOEs, including (but not limited to) state-owned banks.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  SOEs in the CWA region have a substantial presence in delivering public services and \nimplementing public policies, and play a crucial role in economic development across a range of \nsectors. Even though they are the most dominant potential partners in various sectors, from \ntransport and energy to finance and health, many are financially and operationally unsustainable \nand must rely  on their  government's continuous financial  support  to maintain their  regular \nbusiness operations. A lack of competition and insufficient commercial, performance-related \nincentives\u2014coupled with competing commercial objectives and policy mandates, poor corporate \ngovernance, and diffuse and opaque state ownership structures\u2014often result in low operational \nefficiency and productivity of SOEs. Their limited capacity also means that they have less access \nto commercial financing than private enterprises. This all translates into a vicious circle that \nhampers the financial sustainability of SOEs, and ultimately the long-term competitiveness and \ngrowth of the overall economy. Underperforming SOEs have created an increasing fiscal burden \nfor developing member countries, and the continued financing of unprofitable SOEs may cause \ncontingent liabilities and significant risks to a stable financial system and the overall economy. \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 August 2021. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  CWRD has long worked with governments and SOEs to support reforms in public sector \nmanagement,  governance,  and  institutional  capacity  for  service  delivery.  Recent  initiatives \ninclude ADB's policy-based loan to Uzbekistan for subprogram 2 of the Economic Management \nImprovement Program, which helps SOEs implement corporate governance rules; creates a \ncentralized special fund for SOEs' restructuring, divestment, and privatization; and facilitates the \nrevaluation  of  SOE  assets,  the  sale  of  non-core  assets,  and  the  preparation  of  financial \nstatements.3 Another  example  is  ADB's  Sustainable  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nDevelopment Program in Georgia, which will transform water supply and sanitation governance \nand institutions by creating a cohesive sector policy and legal basis, and initiating reforms of \npoorly performing SOEs.4  The ADB SOE working group recently published a study, \"The \nBankable SOE: Commercial Financing for SOEs,\u201d which discusses the reforms that are most \neffective in making SOEs bankable.5  \n \n6.  The CWRD operations have strengthened the enabling environment for SOE and sector \nreforms by helping (i) establish national development strategies for SOEs, (ii) adapt legal and \nregulatory frameworks, (iii) formulate sector-based development strategies and policy, (iv) set up \ncentral committees to guide SOEs' transformation and governance, and (v) facilitate government \ninvestment and divestment strategies, and related sovereign support.  \n \n7.  In its thematic evaluation report on State-Owned Enterprise Engagement and Reform,6 \nADB's Independent Evaluation Department found that SOE reforms had not been the primary \nfocus of most sovereign, nonsovereign, and TA operations. However, it highlighted that well-\ncoordinated operations under upstream sovereign investments that leverage SOE reforms and \nnonsovereign support to SOE clients can improve ADB's effectiveness in supporting SOE reforms \nand ultimately ensure the efficient use of public resources. \n \n8.  The TA will build on the work of the CWRD sector divisions, resident missions, and the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s governance thematic group by \nengaging with a group of efficient and capable SOEs that have the potential for commercial \nfinancing. The TA will thus connect ADB's public and private sector operations to deliver a \ncomprehensive package of integrated solutions directly to SOE clients, and thereby strengthen \nADB's partnership with SOEs and, ultimately, the respective national governments. \n \n9.  The TA support provided directly to SOE clients can be a useful instrument to deepen \ndiscussions on a variety of integrated solutions such as sector reforms and SOE transformations, \nand to create opportunities to gradually migrate SOE clients to the domain of commercial \nfinancing. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: governance and institutional capacity of SOEs \nstrengthened and private sector operations expanded (footnote 1). The TA will have the following \noutcome: commercial orientation of SOEs in the CWA region enhanced.7  \n \n3  ADB. Uzbekistan: Economic Management Improvement Program, Subprogram 2.   \n4  ADB.

Manila: ADB. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Categorization and credit mapping of state-owned enterprises conducted. \nThe TA team will prepare a long list of SOEs in ADB\u2019s priority sectors and segments\u2014energy, \ntransport, telecommunications, postal service, urban and water services, finance, agriculture, \nhealth, and education\u2014and group the SOEs into categories.8 It will then prepare a short list of \nSOEs which, based on their financial viability and credit rating, can likely improve within 2\u20133 years \nto a level that is acceptable to commercial financiers; this will include a brief justification for each. \nOutput 1 will apply to developing member countries where such an SOE categorization and credit \nmapping has not yet been carried out,9 and to the preliminary SOE list that emerges from requests \nby governments10 and consultations with CWRD resident missions, sector divisions, and ADB's \nPrivate Sector Operations Department. The findings will provide a high-level understanding of \nSOEs\u2019 financial performance and will feed into output 2. \n \n12.  Output  2:  360\u00b0  reviews  of  selected  state-owned  enterprises'  readiness  for \ncommercialization conducted.  Based on the findings of the SOE categorization and credit \nmapping exercise under output 1, or based on the results from studies already carried out by ADB \nand other development partners on SOEs that have approached ADB, the TA will target those \nSOEs with the greatest commitment and readiness to access financing on commercial terms and \nconditions. A new 360\u00b0 review framework of SOE bankability will be piloted, which will include (i) \nstrategic dialogues in workshops to understand selected SOEs\u2019 needs and to share knowledge \non best practice; and (ii) a comprehensive and in-depth analysis to understand and define the \nscope of each SOE's transformation, covering topics such as strategy, credit and financial \nassessment,  business  and  operational  management,  corporate  governance,  gender \ninclusiveness, risk management, digital and information technology transformation, organizational \ntransformation, and business process transformation. The TA team will also look at how the state \nmakes major decisions with regard to the SOE, to what extent the SOE is financially dependent \non the state or is cross-subsidized by other SOEs, and to what extent other SOEs are financially \ndependent on it. Finally, the TA team will assess SOEs\u2019 climate change adaptation and mitigation \nstrategies depending on the sectors selected.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Commercialization program for state-owned enterprises designed and \ncapacity built. The TA team will design a program to commercialize SOEs' operations, boost \ntheir financial sustainability, and build institutional capacity. This involves: \n(i)   presenting the results from the 360\u00b0 reviews and a high-level business case for change \nto the SOEs' boards of directors, including the respective government shareholders \nand other relevant stakeholders;  \n(ii)   developing a portfolio of transformation initiatives in key areas such as  \n(a) governance and structure (independence of the SOE management, investor \ndiscipline, sustainability);  \n(b) core operational capacity (risk, finance, information technology, accounting, \ntraining);  \n \n8  A detailed categorization will be defined during implementation.       \n9  Either by ADB or other development partners such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Developing member countries that have SOE categorization \nand/or credit mapping include Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n10  CWRD was approached by several governments to support SOE transformation and thus reduce SOEs' dependence \non government support. These SOEs are included in the preliminary SOE list so that an initial high-level assessment \ncan be conducted. \n \n ", "4 \n(c)  SOEs'  strategies  (markets,  clients,  products,  channels)  and  measurable \nobjectives and goals;  \n(d) performance management (key performance indicators, public expenditure \ntracking  surveys  for  service-oriented  SOEs,  talent,  gender  inclusiveness, \nincentives);  \n(e) change and program management (change, cultural reform); and  \n(f)  strategy and plan for public and private sector financing and investment (debt, \nequity, hybrid instruments); and  \n(iii)  conducting  workshops  and  training  sessions  on  transformation-related  change \nmanagement  and  technical  best  practice,  where  SOE  management  teams  will \nestablish a phased road map and agreed terms of implementation. \n \n14.  A key fundamental assumption of the TA is that the governments and the SOEs have a \nclear interest in and commitment to SOE commercialization. To mitigate the TA implementation \nrisks and optimize TA resource utilization, the TA targets those SOEs that are willing, and are \ntaking respective actions, to work toward commercialization and access to finance on quasi- or \nfully commercial terms. SOEs that are not organized as commercial entities and SOEs that keep \nmaking losses will require more reform support at policy, sector, and institutional levels before \nbeing ready for commercialization, which may take longer than the implementation period of the \npilot TA; hence, they would not be eligible to receive support under this TA.  \n \n15.  The TA program aims to develop a pilot approach that is scalable and replicable, and that \ndeepens the commercial orientation of SOEs in the region by supporting \"enterprise-level\" \nfinancial sustainability and commercialization. The TA also takes a new strategic approach overall \nby focusing on the more commercially oriented SOEs in the CWA region under a program. \nPrevious ADB projects have taken a more ad-hoc approach by trying to make one or two particular \nSOEs more financially sustainable. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s value addition is to deliver a comprehensive package of \nintegrated solutions to SOE clients through the One ADB approach. The TA activities complement \nwell, and enable synergies with, ADB\u2019s existing work on sector and SOE reforms. The TA also \ndemonstrates to potential commercial financiers the feasibility of more commercial financing for \nand private sector participation in SOE operations.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  ($900,000 from TASF-7; $850,000 from TASF-other \nsources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA through CWRD's Client Solutions Team (CST) and the Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Trade Division; in close coordination and collaboration with \nCWRD sector divisions and resident missions, and the Private Sector Operations Department. \nThe One ADB approach will also extend the consultations with other ADB departments, and \nsector and thematic groups where needed, to create synergies with ongoing development efforts. \n \n19.  ADB will work with government authorities involved in managing and/or supervising SOEs \nto make sure that their governments have no objection to an SOE being supported under the TA. \n \n ", "5 \nEach SOE must also indicate its clear interest and willingness to engage in this process with ADB, \nand provide available counterpart resources.   \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 42 months, from October 2021 to March 2025. CST and \nCWRD's Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division will select, supervise, and \nevaluate the consultants. Given the diverse requirements and activities that the TA is expected to \ninvolve, ADB will consider recruiting both individual (national and international) consultants and \nfirms. \n \n21.
