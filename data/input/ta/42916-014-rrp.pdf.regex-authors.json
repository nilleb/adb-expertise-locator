I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a (i) proposed \ndirect loan of $250 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ordinary capital resources; \n(ii) proposed administration of a loan of up to $80 million, to be provided by the ADB Clean \nTechnology Fund (CTF);1 and (iii) proposed administration of a loan of up to $20 million, to be \nprovided by the Canadian Climate Fund for Private Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility (CEFPF) to Sarulla Operations Limited, Sarulla Power Asset \nLimited, Kyuden Sarulla Private Limited, OrSarulla Incorporated, and PT Medco Geopower \nSarulla for the Sarulla Geothermal Power Development Project in Indonesia. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Identifying a clean energy path. A more secure and sustainable future for Indonesia is \ncontingent upon increased access to clean energy. The country presented strong economic \nperformance  throughout  the  global  recession,  with  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth \naveraging 6% during 2009-2012.2 If this growth continues, demand for electricity is projected to \nrise by more than 8% per annum until 2029. As Indonesia currently uses coal and oil to produce \n65% of its electricity and fuel its economic growth, a failure to diversify into cleaner energy \nsources for power generation will magnify the country\u2019s contributions to global greenhouse \ngases (GHGs) and ultimately its own exposure to climate change risks.  \n \n3.  The Government of Indonesia recognizes the imperative of sustainable growth and aims \nto increase the share of renewable energy in the country\u2019s primary energy supply from 5% in \n2010 to 25% by 2025 and achieve a reduction in GHG emissions of 26% by 2020.3 Indonesia is \nendowed  with  several  renewable  energy  options,  including  wind,  solar,  geothermal,  and \nbiomass.  However,  geothermal  energy  is  particularly  suited  to  support  Indonesia\u2019s  more \nsustainable future: \n(i)  Geothermal power comes from thermal energy that is naturally generated in the earth \nand most accessible and abundant near tectonic plate boundaries.4 Due to its location at \nthe edge of the Pacific plate, Indonesia has extensive geothermal resources estimated \nat about 29 gigawatts and equivalent to 40% of the global geothermal resource base.  \n(ii)  Geothermal power plants are very reliable and demonstrate high capacity factors. Thus, \nthey can provide a sizeable portion of base load power, unlike intermittent renewable \nenergy sources like wind or solar, and contribute to a more secure energy mix. \n(iii)  Geothermal power plants typically emit less than 10% of the GHG emitted by fossil-\nfuelled thermal plants, and thereby provide an effective means for Indonesia to achieve \nboth domestic and international climate change mitigation objectives.  \n(iv)  Power generation costs of large geothermal power plants in Java and Sumatra are less \nthan the country\u2019s total average power generation cost. Geothermal sector development \ncan therefore improve the long-term financial health of the national electricity utility, \nPerusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), while reducing the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.5  \n                                                \n1 Financed by the ADB\u2019s Clean Technology Fund. http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n2 Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n3 Geothermal Sector (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4 In a geothermal power plant, high-pressure steam from a production wellhead powers a turbine to generate energy. \n5 PLN. 2013. 2012 Statistik PLN. Jakarta.  ", "2   \n4.  Indonesia\u2019s 3,200 megawatt (MW) geothermal development project pipeline accounts for \n24%  of  the  capacity  of  geothermal  projects  now  planned  globally.  Despite  the  compelling \nopportunity presented by untapped geothermal resources, only 1,226 MW of installed capacity, \nor 4.2% of the country\u2019s total geothermal potential, has been developed to date. Challenges in \ngeothermal power development include high up-front costs and geological risks that can affect \nexploration,  development,  and  long-term  operations. 6  Commercial  financing  has  not \nmaterialized even though geothermal regulation in Indonesia has substantially improved since \n2003. The investment needed to develop the country\u2019s full geothermal potential will only appear \nwhen the actual and perceived risks are reduced through the financing, implementation, and \noperation of projects with the demonstrative capacity to initiate market transformation.   \n \n5.  History. The project\u2019s geothermal resources were originally explored by Unocal North \nSumatera Geothermal in 1993. The company spent about $80 million in initial resource and site \ndevelopment  and  technical  studies,  but  suspended  its  works  in  1998  due  to  challenges \npresented by the Asian Financial Crisis and later sold its development rights to PLN. In 2004, \nsoon after a law was adopted to promote private sector participation in the geothermal sector, \nPLN invited qualified power generators to participate in an Independent Power Producers (IPP) \nbidding process for the Sarulla development rights.7 The first-ranked bidder failed to secure \nfinancing during 2005, and the right was offered to the second lowest bidder, a consortium \nformed  by  Itochu  Corporation,  Ormat  International,  and  Medco  Power  Indonesia  in  2006. \nKyushu Electric Power Company joined the consortium in 2008. ADB and the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) were subsequently invited to support the project due to its \nneed for long-term foreign currency financing.  \n \n6.  Concessional financing. The proposed project will be ADB\u2019s first loan in Indonesia \nadministering resources allocated by the ADB CTF and the Canadian Climate Fund for Private \nSector in Asia under CEFPF. Funded by the multilateral Climate Investment Funds, ADB CTF \npromotes financing for demonstrating, deploying, and transferring low-carbon technologies with \nsignificant potential for long-term reduction of GHG emissions. It is implemented by multilateral \ndevelopment  banks,  including  ADB,  and  is  one  of  the  largest  multilateral  funds  helping \ndeveloping countries finance climate change mitigation projects.8 Given the inherent resource \nrisks, capital-intensive development, and current market stagnation in the geothermal sector, \nADB, the government and development partners have identified a clear need to deploy a \ndiscrete amount of concessional financing to leverage commercial lending and accelerate sector \ndevelopment.  \n2.  Project Design  \n7.  The  project  will  develop  the  steam  resources  in  the  Sarulla  concession  area  and \nconstruct, operate, and maintain three geothermal power generation units with a total capacity \nof  about  320 megawatts  (MW). The  units  will  be  powered  by  steam from  production  and \ninjection facilities at the Silangkitang and Namora-I-Langit reservoirs, located in North Sumatra. \nThe project will be developed and implemented under a 30-year energy sales contract (ESC) \nwith PLN, a 30-year joint operating contract (JOC) with Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) \n                                                \n6 As a result of the drilling required, capital costs for geothermal plants can be more than three times those for \nconventional fossil fuel plants. In addition, future development of the geothermal market is unlikely to benefit from \ndramatic, technology-driven cost reductions that have recently occurred in the solar, wind, and natural gas sectors. \nSee Geothermal Sector (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7 Government of Indonesia. 2003.

", "  3 \nand a 20-year guarantee from the Ministry of Finance, as stipulated under a business viability \nguarantee letter (BVGL). The project is intended for base load operation and will include a 14 \nkilometer transmission line from Namora-I-Langit to a 150 kilovolt (kV) substation to be built by \nPLN near Silangkitang. The substation will connect power from the generation units to the \nSumatra grid through a 275 kV transmission line, to be built by PLN. The project benefits from \nstrong contractual arrangements with creditworthy, investment-grade parties: the Government of \nIndonesia, rated BB+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s; PLN, rated BB by S&P \nand Baa3 by Moody\u2019s; and Pertamina, rated BB+ by S&P and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s. \n3.

Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n9.  Impact. The project will help the government advance towards its renewable energy and \nclimate change mitigation goals.  Successful implementation of the project and deployment of \nconcessional cofinacing will lead to: (i) increased geothermal power generation in Indonesia; (ii) \nmore private sector investment in the geothermal sector; and (iii) increased electrification rate in \nIndonesia.  \n \n10.  Outcome. The project outcome will be expanded geothermal power generation in North \nSumatra. The project will demonstrate the viability of a large-scale IPP geothermal project for \nthe first time since 1999. By developing new geothermal, base load power generation in North \nSumatra, the  project  will  help  displace  fossil fuel-generated  power,  which  is  the  dominant \nalternative for base-load generation in the Sumatra grid. The construction and operation of the \npower plants will generate employment for the local community, including opportunities for \nwomen, and support climate change mitigation through an estimated net reduction in carbon \ndioxide (CO ) emissions equivalent to 1.3 million tons per year. A smaller carbon footprint helps \n2\nprovide healthier and more sustainable living conditions for the people of Indonesia. \n \n11.  Output.  The  project  output  will  be  the  construction  and  commissioning  of  three \ngeothermal power generation units with a total capacity of about 320 MW.  \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n12.  Consistency with Strategy 2020. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, \nwhich emphasizes support for environmentally sustainable growth, and development of the \nprivate sector.10 The strategy supports expanding environment-friendly technologies for clean \nenergy generation and energy efficiency, as well as a larger role for private sector financing of \ninfrastructure through public\u2013private partnerships. Through the administration of the ADB CTF \nand  CEFPF  loans,  the  project  increases  direct,  value-adding  cofinancing  in  nonsovereign \nprojects supporting multiple strategies and objectives under ADB\u2019s finance ++ approach.11 \n \n13.  Consistency with the country strategy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia for 2012\u20132014.12 It supports the strategy\u2019s second pillar of \nenvironmental  sustainability  through  climate  change  mitigation,  which  prioritizes  projects \ndesigned to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. The project also supports the \ngovernment\u2019s long-term objective under the endorsed CTF investment plan for Indonesia13 to \ndeploy CTF resources to leverage commercial financing of geothermal projects. \n \n14.  Consistency with the sector strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy \nPolicy, which emphasizes investment in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and wider access \nto energy.14 Though ADB reached its internal goal of $2 billion per annum in clean energy in \n2011, the project helps sustain that level of investment in 2013 and further bolster the private \nsector role in catalyzing additional resources in the renewable energy sector.15  \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2008.

The remaining land identified for acquisition \nis being procured through negotiated settlement, and a resettlement plan was prepared to \nmitigate any potential economic displacement. In addition, an indigenous peoples plan has been \nprepared to mitigate impacts on members of the Batak ethnic group and to maximize project \nbenefits for affected communities.  \n \n17.  To help avoid the anticipated impacts, SOL will implement generally recognized good \npractices,  as  well  as  preventive  and  control  measures  outlined  in  the  World  Bank  Group \nenvironmental, health, and safety (EHS) guidelines and laid out in the project\u2019s environmental \nand  social  assessments  and  management  plan.  Key  community  concerns  raised  during \nconsultations included EHS, employment, corporate social responsibility opportunities, and land \nacquisition impacts. SOL is committed to developing and implementing an EHS management \nsystem in line with applicable national legislation and industry codes and standards. Through a \ncontractors\u2019 safety management system, SOL has also committed to accord equal priority in the \n \nprotection of its contractors, vendors, customers, and company employees. \n \n18.  Other social dimensions. The project is expected to have some gender elements. \nMeasures to benefit women have been incorporated in the project design in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (2003).21 These include assistance for vulnerable \nwomen affected by the land acquisition, facilitating the employment and involvement of women \nand  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  during  surveys.  The  project  is  also  expected  to \ngenerate job opportunities during both its construction and operational phases, and SOL will try \nto meet the employment targets set for women and indigenous peoples.  ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions requiring SOL to comply with the \nnational labor laws and, in addition, take specific measures (including in relation to contractors) \nto meet internationally recognized core labor standards for the ADB-financed portion of the \nproject, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.22   \nB.  Anticorruption Policy   \n19.  The sponsors and borrowers were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date), and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \n                                                \n17 Since 2008, consultation and negotiation activities were conducted by SOL in a culturally appropriate manner, \nusing Batak facilitators and both the Bahasa Indonesia and Batak languages. Key information from the safeguard \nplans were disclosed to affected villages, project-affected households and civil society organizations during \nadditional consultations in August and September 2013. \n18 These comprise the environmental and social impact analysis and environmental management and monitoring \nplans. Due to design changes, an addendum environmental and social impact analysis was prepared and is \nawaiting government approval. \n19 Supplemental studies on water resources extraction, potential occurrence of natural and geologic hazards, \nbiodiversity and cumulative impacts, hydrogen sulfide modeling, among other assessments were undertaken, and \nassociated management plans were prepared. \n20 A contingency budget has been allocated to implement the environmental corrective action plan. \n21 ADB. 2003.
