I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Tamil Nadu Urban Flagship Investment \nProgram. The report also describes (i) proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening \nInstitutional Capacity for Project Development and Urban Governance in Tamil Nadu, and (ii) the \nproposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility;1 and if the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA and the administration \nof the grant. \n \n2.  The program will develop priority water supply, sewerage, and drainage infrastructure in \nat least 10 cities in strategic industrial corridors in Tamil Nadu.2 It will (i) support innovative pilot \nprojects, including India's first solar-powered sewage treatment plant (STP) to offset greenhouse \ngas emissions and enhance operational efficiency; (ii) strengthen urban governance; and (iii) build \ncapacity  of  state  and  local  institutions  to  enhance  urban  service  delivery,  environmental \nsustainability, and climate resilience.3 \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \n3.  Urban challenges. Tamil Nadu is the most urbanized of India\u2019s large states\u201448.5% of \nits population lives in urban areas, a share that is projected to increase to 67.0% in 2030\u2014and \nmakes the second-largest contribution to the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Although Tamil \nNadu is a leader in many areas of manufacturing, managing its rapid urbanization is essential to \nsustain economic growth, alleviate poverty, and maintain urban livability. Key challenges include \n(i) acute infrastructure deficits as a result of rapid urbanization; (ii) growth of slum populations; (iii) \npollution of waterways; (iv) weak institutional capacity to plan and implement projects; and (v) \nmixed performance in key areas of governance, including local revenue generation, financial \nmanagement, and municipal administration. Water-related disasters\u2014such as recurring droughts \n(once in every 2.5 years) and catastrophic urban floods linked to climate change\u2014are aggravated \nby the high water losses associated with aging distribution networks, and inadequate drainage \nsystems not adapted to heavier monsoon rains. Addressing these complex challenges requires \nsignificant investments and deeper institutional support. \n \n4.  Low levels of urban services. In Tamil Nadu, urban service levels remain low. As of \n2017: (i) 48% of households are served by piped water; (ii) 80% of cities receive less than 80 \nliters of water per capita per day versus the national standard of 135 liters per capita per day; (iii) \nnonrevenue water (NRW) is 30%\u201350%; (iv) 42% of households are covered by a sewerage \nnetwork; (v) wastewater treatment capacity is 43% of sewage generation; and (vi) urban drainage \ncoverage is 50%.4 Low service levels are primarily the result of inadequate local finances to invest \nin  capital  expenditures  and  a  shortage  of  trained  staff.  The  program  will  directly  support \nimprovement in these areas. \n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. ADB secured approval of the Asian Clean Energy Fund grant outside the \nMFF and will disburse the funding concurrently with Tranche 1. \n2  The project will include the following city corporations and municipalities (collectively referred to as cities): Ambur, \nChennai, Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Rajapalayam, Thoothukudi, Tiruppur, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, and Vellore. The \ncities were selected based on population size, location in economic corridors, and eligibility for central government \nfunds (para. 7). Other cities eligible for support under the program are subject to compliance with selection criteria \noutlined in the Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n3  ADB. 2015.

Chennai. \n ", "2 \n5.  Road map. To address the challenges of rapid urbanization, the state aims to (i) provide \nuniversal access to water and sanitation, (ii) develop \u201cworld-class\u201d cities, (iii) establish high-\nperforming industrial corridors, and (iv) promote climate-resilient urban development.5 Tamil \nNadu\u2019s strategic documents outline programs that support capacity building; enable access to \ninfrastructure development funds; and employ green technologies, such as solar power, to \nachieve sector goals.6 Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 estimated an urban investment requirement of \n$42.7 billion, including $7.5 billion for water supply and sanitation, prioritizing continuous and full \ncoverage of services. The State Annual Action Plan, 2017\u20132020 (footnote 4) identified 136 \nprojects in 27 cities covering water supply, sewerage, and drainage infrastructure. \n \n6.  Policy framework. The Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department (MAWS) \n(the state-level agency for urban development in Tamil Nadu) established the Commissionerate \nof Municipal Administration (CMA) to (i) support urban local bodies (ULBs) (municipalities) plan \ninfrastructure to meet national service-level standards; and (ii) advance urban reforms set forth in \nIndia\u2019s Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, focusing on the devolution of service \ndelivery and revenue generation to ULBs. However, to improve the financial and governance \nperformance of ULBs, the state needs to strengthen CMA\u2019s capacity to support ULBs and monitor \nurban reforms, particularly in areas of revenue generation, financial management, operation and \nmaintenance (O&M), and the introduction of innovative approaches in the sector. \n \n7.  National urban flagship programs. Tamil Nadu will access funds from three national \nurban flagship programs under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs: (i) the Swachh Bharat \nMission for Urban Areas, (ii) the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, and (iii) \nthe Smart Cities Mission. The programs are complementary. However, given the large investment \nrequirements of Tamil Nadu, additional funds are required, and the state requested ADB for TA \nand financial assistance to help achieve its urban sector goals (para. 5). \n \n8.  Strategic context. The program aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u2013\n2022 for India, particularly the three growth pillars linked to India\u2019s urban transformation;7 and is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.8 It supports the development of \nthe Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor and the second phase of the East Coast Economic \nCorridor, India\u2019s first coastal economic corridor implemented by the state in partnership with ADB \nto link Tamil Nadu\u2019s manufacturing sector with global value chains in East and Southeast Asia.9 \nThe project will enhance basic services of major cities within economic corridors to meet worker\u2019s \nquality-of-life needs, as well as provide industry with a reliable source of treated and reusable \nwastewater for production demands. The program supports synergies with proposed ADB energy \nand transport projects in Tamil Nadu for industrial corridor development (footnote 8). \n                                                \n5  Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 defines \u201cworld-class\u201d cities as those that are free from garbage and open defecation and \nwhose infrastructure is upgraded with continuous water supply access, and efficient mass transit and sanitation \nsystems. (Government of Tamil Nadu. 2012. Vision Tamil Nadu 2023: Strategic Plan for Infrastructure Development \nin Tamil Nadu. Chennai). Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 lists five priority industrial corridors: Chennai\u2013Hosur, Chennai\u2013\nTiruchirappalli, Coimbatore\u2013Madurai, Coimbatore\u2013Salem, and Madurai\u2013Thoothukudi.  \n6  Government of Tamil Nadu. 2012.

The investment program uses innovative approaches \nand builds on lessons from past urban projects by (i) ensuring all water supply and sewerage \ncontracts include household service connections to ensure immediate use of new facilities;10 (ii) \napplying new technologies for smart cities\u2014such as India\u2019s first solar-powered STP, online \nautomatic water meters, and supervisory control and data acquisition systems for real-time \nmonitoring\u2014to  address  water  management  challenges;  (iii)  expanding  recycling  of  treated \nwastewater for industrial reuse;11 (iv) employing extended O&M contracts for smooth start-up of \nSTPs; and (v) aligning urban investments to support strategic industrial corridor development.12 \nIt will also integrate findings of ongoing ADB knowledge-related technical assistance in areas of \nclimate resilience and smart water management into project designs of future tranches.13  \n \nIII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The investment program is aligned with the following impacts: (i) universal access to basic \nwater and sanitation services achieved; (ii) \u201cworld-class\u201d cities and industrial corridors across the \nstate developed; and (iii) water security, reduced vulnerability to climate change in urban areas, \nand enhanced share of renewable energy achieved. 14 The investment program will have the \nfollowing outcome: livability and climate resilience in at least 10 cities in priority industrial corridors \nenhanced.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Climate-resilient sewage collection and treatment, and drainage systems \ndeveloped in at least eight cities. This includes (i) 187 million liters per day (MLD) of new and \n155 MLD of rehabilitated sewage treatment capacity developed, with solar power systems \ninstalled for STP operations on a pilot basis; (ii) treated wastewater reused for industrial purposes \nin selected areas; (iii) 2,810 kilometers (km) of sewage collection pipelines constructed, with \n426,600 households connected; (iv) 173 sewage pump stations with a combined capacity of 6,390 \nkilowatts (kW) constructed; (v) 20 all-female community water and sanitation committees formed; \nand (vi) climate-resilient drainage and flood management systems (250 km of tertiary and 50 km \nof primary and secondary drains) established in selected cities.15 \n \n12.  Output 2: Water supply systems in at least five cities improved with smart features. \nThis includes (i) smart water supply distribution systems (1,520 km pipelines) established within \n110 new district metered areas (DMAs) to reduce NRW and provide regular water supply, with \n100% of households (total of 171,000) connected; (ii) 120 km of transmission mains built; (iii) 30 \n                                                \n10 Slow connectivity was a key reason behind the less than successful rating of some ADB urban projects (Independent \nEvaluation Department. 2017.

Investment planning is based on demand \nfor services and absorptive capacity of cities.  \n ", "4 \npump stations (1,530 kW capacity) constructed; and (iv) 40 water storage reservoirs (combined \ncapacity  of  70  million  liters),  covering  Chennai,  Coimbatore,  Cuddalore,  Tiruppur,  and \nThoothukudi constructed. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Institutional  capacity,  public  awareness,  and  urban  governance \nstrengthened. This includes (i) establishing within CMA (a) a new state-level urban data and \ngovernance improvement cell, and (b) a new project design and management center; and (ii) \nimplementing (a) state-wide performance-based urban governance improvement program for \nTamil Nadu\u2019s 135 cities to improve revenue, financial management, administration, service \ndelivery, gender mainstreaming, wastewater reuse, and fecal sludge management; and (b) public \nawareness campaigns on water conservation, sanitation, and hygiene in project cities. The \nprogram will intensify the capacity building of key urban institutions and provide incentives for \nurban governance improvement. Project design consultants will be recruited by the PMU to \nprepare new projects in subsequent tranches that meet ADB requirements. \n \n14.  Use of multitranche financing facility. To achieve the outcome, the outputs are best \nfinanced by an MFF.16 \n(i)  The program involves a series of clearly identified large-scale urban investments \nof similar nature (paras. 11\u201313) in different locations with no significant impacts on \nthe environment, resettlement, or indigenous people. No Category A safeguards \nprojects will be included in the MFF. The state is committed to implementing the \nprogram following its urban sector road map. \n(ii)  The executing and implementing agencies have strong track records in managing \nlarge  development  partner-funded  projects  and  safeguards.17 Tranches  are \nsequenced based on the readiness and absorptive capacity of cities for large \ninvestments.18 Tranches are mutually dependent in design (e.g., networks and \ntreatment), governance improvement, and capacity building. \n(iii)  The MFF will facilitate deeper policy dialogue and capacity building in areas of \nclimate change resilience, financial sustainability, and urban governance (para. 6), \nwhich are critical areas where ADB can add value, and which require long-term \ncommitments and an extended implementation period. There are no foreseeable \nrisks to the continuity of policy dialogue under the program. \n \n15.  Scope of Tranche 1. Tranche 1 is representative of MFF investments and will support \nChennai, Coimbatore, Rajapalayam, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, and Vellore. \n \n16.

ULBs will provide counterpart staff to coordinate project activities. \n29 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others).30 The TA has two \noutputs: (i) capacity of CMA to support ULBs in preparing and scaling up urban infrastructure \nprojects in Tamil Nadu strengthened, and (ii) capacity of CMA to implement urban governance \nimprovement programs strengthened. The TA will strengthen the capacity of the new project \ndesign and management center in CMA to support ULBs in preparing project proposals and \napplying innovative approaches in the sector. It will also strengthen the capacity of CMA to apply \nbest  practices  in  urban  governance  improvement  programs.  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. CMA will be \nthe implementing agency for the TA from September 2018 to December 2020. \n \nV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  ADB conducted technical due diligence of Tranche 1 to ensure subprojects designs are \nrobust,  including  a  comprehensive  review  of  feasibility  studies,  engineering  designs,  cost \nestimates,  and  site  investigations.  ADB  appraised subprojects  based  on  (i)  rationale  and \nrelevance, benefits, and ease of implementation and operations; (ii) technical alternatives and \ntheir viability, including STP technology and NRW management; (iii) life cycle costs, including \ncapital and operating costs; and achievable cost savings through energy efficiency, renewable \nenergy, and climate-resilient measures; (iv) maximizing beneficiary area coverage including the \npoor;  (v)  minimizing  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts;  and  (vi)  optimizing \nimplementation timelines through high project readiness. In all subprojects with existing facilities, \nADB assessed the viability of the facilities and, where possible, incorporated them into the new \nsystems through renovation and expansion. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  rationale  for  government  intervention  is  sound. \nTranche 1 aims to provide stronger and more sustainable water supply and sewerage services in \nsix project cities. The estimated economic internal rates of return of the seven subprojects under \nTranche 1 are 10.6%\u201315.3%, while the combined economic internal rate of return was about \n12.2%, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of about 9.0%, indicating significant \neconomic returns. The sensitivity analysis also revealed the results are satisfactory, except under \na scenario in which all downside risks are combined, i.e., (i) a 20% capital cost overrun, (ii) a 20% \nO&M  cost  overrun,  (iii)  a  20%  decline  in  estimated  benefits,  and  (iv)  a  1-year  delay  in \nimplementation. Tranche 1 is likely to be economically more viable because of unquantifiable \nbenefits  not reflected  in  the  analysis,  such  as  environmental  improvements  and  increased \nproperty values. \n \n26.  Financial analysis. ADB conducted a financial analysis for the subprojects under Tranche \n1 to ensure their sustainability and to determine whether revenues generated will cover O&M \ncosts.  The  financial  analysis  indicates  all  Tranche  1  subprojects  would  generate  sufficient \nrevenues to cover full O&M costs, provided CMWSSB and the project ULBs implement regular \ntariff revisions. The financial performance, at the entity level, of CMWSSB and project ULBs \nindicated they all depend substantially on state grants. The financial projections for CMWSSB \nand project ULBs demonstrate that the revenue account will remain in surplus given (i) tariff \nrationalization, (ii) improved collection efficiency, and (iii) continued government support. \n \n                                                \n30 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies can undertake the financial management of ADB-financed \nprojects.31 TNUIFSL has extensive experience in handling large-scale development partner-\nsupported projects with substantial value. In addition, TNUIFSL, CMWSSB, and project ULBs \nhave an established legal, institutional, and monitoring framework for budgeting, accounting, and \nauditing. The overall risk assessment for the investment program is moderate. The risk mitigation \nmeasures include (i) extending full training and capacity building support to enhance the financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  TNUIFSL,  CMWSSB,  and  project  ULBs;  (ii)  obtaining  the  state\u2019s \ncommitment that it will set up the PMU and PIUs in a timely manner, with qualified staff; and (iii) \neffectively  implementing  the  systematic  plans  by  CMWSSB  and  project  ULBs  to  enhance \nrevenues and reduce costs. \n \n28.  Procurement. Procurement of civil works and goods including consulting services will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).32 The procurement \nof consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). A procurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall procurement risk for \nthe project is moderate. TNUIFSL has extensive experience in development partner-supported \nprocurement of large works and will provide advisory support to CMA and ULBs. \n \n29.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and TNUIFSL. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the FAM. Based on the risk assessments, some of the \nmitigation measures incorporated in the program design aim to (i) establish a mechanism for \nregular voluntary disclosure of relevant information; (ii) develop and update a website to enhance \ntransparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (iii)  establish  a \ngrievance redress mechanism to ensure effective resolution of any grievances. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  In Tamil Nadu, nearly 13% of the population lives in urban poverty, and rapid urbanization \nis accelerating the growth of urban slums. The program will indirectly contribute to poverty \nreduction in urban areas and to achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6, which supports \naccess to clean water and sanitation for all. Pro-poor designs include (i) providing water and \nsanitation services to slums; (ii) conducting awareness campaigns in poor communities in areas \nof water conservation, health, sanitation, and women\u2019s safety; and (iii) providing skills training to \npoor project-affected persons. \n \n31.  Gender. Tranche 1 is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Gender design features \ninclude (i) increasing women\u2019s access to safe water and sanitation, especially in poor areas; (ii) \npromoting the participation of women from poor urban communities and increasing representation \nof  women  in  decision-making  bodies;  (iii)  gender-related  capacity  building  for  project \nstakeholders;  (iv)  promoting  equitable  access to  project  employment opportunities;  and (v) \nproviding equal opportunity employment across positions in ULBs. ADB prepared a gender action \n                                                \n31 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 The concept paper was approved in December 2015 prior to the cut-off date (1 July 2017) for the new Procurement \nPolicy (2017).  \n \n ", "10 \nplan, and a community awareness and participation plan.33 CMA and ULBs will implement pro-\npoor and gender activities with support from consultants. \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nof Tranche 1 are as follows. 34 \n \n33.  Environment (category B). Initial environmental examinations were prepared by the \nimplementing agencies for all Tranche 1 subprojects, which showed no significant environmental \nimpacts. The anticipated impacts are temporary and will be avoided or minimized through proven \nmitigation measures and engineering-construction practices, as outlined in the environmental \nmanagement plans. In Vellore and Tiruchirappalli, potentially significant impacts from works \noccurring within the regulated areas of the protected monuments of the Archaeological Society of \nIndia will be avoided by (i) consulting with and obtaining permission from the Archaeological \nSociety of India, and (ii) appointing an archaeological expert to assess impacts and supervise \nconstruction. \n \n34.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  implementing  agencies  prepared \nresettlement plans for all subprojects to assess and adequately address (i) potential temporary \nloss of income for street vendors on proposed pipe alignments; and (ii) permanent impacts in the \nVellore sewerage subproject, including 100% structure loss leading to relocation of 87 vulnerable \naffected persons in 22 households. No private land acquisition is required for Tranche 1. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous people communities present \nat or around subproject sites under Tranche 1. \n \n36.  The mitigation measures outlined in the safeguard documents adequately address the \nassessed impacts. Tranche 1 and the MFF, as per the selection criteria, will not include Category \nA subprojects, and safeguard frameworks will guide subproject preparation.35 The implementing \nagencies conducted public consultations and safeguard documents are disclosed on the ADB \nand project websites. A grievance redress mechanism will address issues in a timely and effective \nmanner. TNUIFSL has sufficient capacity to monitor safeguards based on its experience in \nmanaging development partner-funded urban projects and will submit semiannual safeguard \nmonitoring reports to ADB. Consultants will assist the PIUs in monitoring safeguards compliance. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.36 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nWater shortages from intensified droughts  The program includes climate change adaptation measures to reduce \nlinked to climate change which exceed  water loss, monitor consumption, reuse treated wastewater, and raise \n                                                \n33 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 ADB.
