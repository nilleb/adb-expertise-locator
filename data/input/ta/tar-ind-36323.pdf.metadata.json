INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  2002  India  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  India \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to extend its support beyond the three focal \nstates  (Gujarat,  Kerala  and  Madhya  Pradesh),  and  to  address  the  growing  interregional \ndisparities. Assam, a key state for economic growth in northeastern India, is facing a serious \nfiscal crisis. Given the strong commitment of the state government of Assam (SGA) to reform, \nADB and the Government of India agreed that technical assistance (TA) and a loan would be \nprovided to support reform of Assam\u2019s financial1 and power sectors. \n  \n2.  ADB\u2019s support aims to improve efficiency and achieve financial viability of the power \nsector  by  establishing  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  conducive  to  a  competitive  and \ncommercial business environment, unbundling and corporatizing Assam State Electricity Board \n(ASEB), and strengthening the transmission and distribution system. For this purpose, a loan2 \nand three TA3 projects are included in ADB\u2019s country program for India. The proposed TA is \nintended  to  provide  capacity-building  support  and  make  Assam  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (AERC) fully functional to ensure independent tariff setting and regulation.  \n \n3.  An ADB Mission visited Guwahati, the state capital, and Delhi from 8 to 10 November to \nundertake fact-finding for the TA. The Mission held discussions with SGA, AERC, Government \nofficials, and concerned bilateral aid agencies, and reached an understanding on the objectives, \nscope, cost, and implementation arrangements of the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 \ncountry program for India.4  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Assam is a small state with a total population of 26.6 million. It is in the center of \nnortheastern India and is a strategic corridor for Southeast Asia. Assam\u2019s per capita income of \nRs9,6125 is almost two thirds of the national average; 89% of its population are widely scattered \nin rural areas, and 41% are living below the poverty line. The gross fiscal deficit reached 10%  \nof the state domestic product in FY2000 and is still increasing. Although Assam is blessed with \nnatural resources such as oil, natural gas, and minerals and has thriving tea and rubber \nplantations, its industry has not grown significantly since independence because law and order \nproblems  and  ethnic  unrest  have  deterred  investments  from  outside  the  state.  The  poor \nperformance of the power sector has also been a major impediment to industrial growth. Per \ncapita electricity consumption at 104 kilowatt-hours (kWh) is less than one third of the national \naverage and is the lowest in India. Therefore, improved power supply at a reasonable cost is \nessential to revive the state\u2019s industry and economy. Equally important is restoring the sector to \nfinancial sustainability so that it is no longer a drain on state finances. \n                                                 \n1  A loan, Assam Governance and Public Resource Management, is included in ADB\u2019s 2004 country program for \nIndia. \n2  A loan, Assam Power Sector Development Program, ($200 million) is proposed for 2003 on a stand-by basis. \n3  Three TA projects are included in ADB\u2019s country program for India: Project Processing Technical Assistance: \nAssam Power Sector Development Program\u201d ($800,000, approved on 29 October 2002), Advisory and Operational \nTechnical Assistance (AOTA): Capacity Building of Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission\u201c($500,000) for 2003 \nand AOTA: Restructuring of Assam State Electricity Board\u201d ($1,000,000) for 2005.  \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 5 October 2002. \n5  Estimate for FY2000 at current prices. ", "2  \n5.  The power sector of Assam is facing a serious crisis because of poor performance of \nASEB, a vertically integrated utility, fully owned by SGA. ASEB has an installed capacity of \n574.5 megawatts (MW) comprising 572.5 MW of thermal and 2 MW of hydro power. Of the \nthermal  capacity,  300  MW  is  not  operational  due  to  costly  fuel,  design  problems,  and \ninadequate maintenance. The result is a plant load factor of 15% compared with the national \naverage of 70%. ASEB\u2019s own system meets only 120 MW of the total peak demand of 594 MW. \nThe  deficiency  is  being  met  by  purchasing  power  from  central  power  sector  utilities  and \nneighboring states. Transmission and distribution losses are estimated at 40% due to lack of \ninvestment and maintenance and nontechnical losses.  Because of the low plant load factor and \nhigh transmission and distribution losses, power supply in Assam costs about Rs5.9 per kWh, \nwhich is the highest in all Indian states. Because the average retail tariff covers only 62% of the \ncost, ASEB accumulated losses of Rs44 billion as of March 2002. ASEB has not been able to \nmeet its operating cash requirements, and posted an operating cash deficit of Rs2.5 billion in \nFY2002. \n \n6.  In  March  2001,  SGA  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  central \nGovernment and committed itself to reforming its power sector to provide good quality power to \nall  the  people  in  the  state  and  to  achieve  commercial  viability  so  that  it  can  finance  its \ninvestment needs and stop depending on budgetary subsidies. Following on the memorandum, \nSGA and ASEB have initiated some reform action in areas such as policy and regulatory \nframework, efficiency improvement, financial restructuring, and human resource management. \nA new power sector policy, which has been submitted to the cabinet, describes development \nobjectives, strategies for sector reform and capital investment, and the role of the government in \nsector  development.  This  policy  aims  to  promote  unbundling  of  ASEB  into  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution companies to be incorporated under the Indian Companies Act \nand will become a basis for a reform act of the state. SGA targets the second quarter of 2003 \nfor enactment of the reform act.  A legal and regulatory expert who has been engaged under an \nADB project TA6  (legal and regulatory expert) is supporting SGA in drafting the reform act.  \n \n7.  As required by the memorandum of understanding, AERC was constituted as a one-\nperson commission in August 2001 based on Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act 1998. \nAERC will play a critical role in the power sector reform, particularly because it ensures a \nmechanism where tariff setting will be insulated from political interference and will consider for \nthe interest of consumers and the electricity industry. With no permanent staff as chairman and \nan insufficient operating budget, however, AERC had not been functional till recently. As the \nsector reform became a major policy agenda and realizing that strengthening AERC was \nimperative to keep the reform on track, SGA agreed to provide three permanent officers with \nexpertise in engineering, finance, and accounting,  two advisors on an assignment basis, and \noffice  space.  However,  due  to  the  limited  number  of  permanent  staff  and  lack  of  senior \nmembers other than the chairman, AERC is not ready to receive full capacity building support \nfrom international consultants.  \n \n8.  Presently, the immediate task of AERC is reviewing the first tariff petition recently filed \nby ASEB.  However, none of  the current AERC staff has experience in tariff regulation and \nsufficient knowledge in accounting and finance, which are essential skills  in handling tariff \nissues.  SGA, therefore, will provide a short-term domestic consultancy for hands-on support for \nthe first tariff review. At the same time, basic training is needed immediately in computer skills \nand finance and accounting, the function of a regulator, regulatory issues prevailing in the other \nIndian states undertaking reform. \n                                                 \n6 TA 3957-IND:  Assam Power Sector Development Program ", "  3\n \n9.  As the reform program progresses, AERC will need to discharge a large spectrum of \nfunctions including determining tariffs and corresponding performance norms, issuing licenses, \nand ensuring a nondiscriminatory and commercial business environment. Due to its critical role \nin sector reform, there is a risk that AERC could be a bottleneck unless it functions properly. \nTherefore, SGA needs to undertake full responsibility for making AERC fully functional, with \nsufficient autonomy before major regulatory issues emerge. SGA is of the opinion that AERC \nwill not be able to  fully play  its challenging regulatory role for the reform with its current \ninstitutional capacity. SGA, therefore, plans to reconstitute AERC under a state reform act to \nconvert it from a one-person commission to one with at least three persons, with a new \nmanagerial and organization structure and more permanent staff7. Once sufficiently staffed so \nthat it can absorb skills transfer through technical assistance, AERC will need a full range of \ncapacity-building support from a team of international consultants so that it can properly address \nthe reform objectives and provide a measure of confidence for investments in the sector.   \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will assist AERC to develop its operational standards and procedures and build \nup its institutional capacity to handle regulatory matters effectively and efficiently so as to \npromote the power sector reform of the state of Assam. The TA\u2019s objective will be considered \nachieved  when  AERC  becomes  fully  able  to  make  timely  regulatory  decisions  that  are \nconsistent with the reform objective. The TA framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Given AERC\u2019s lack of absorptive capacity, the TA will be implemented in two phases. In \nphase 1, the TA will focus on basic training of working level staff of the current AERC as well as \nSGA officials who will be involved in the sector reform and routinely deal with AERC staff. In this \nphase, key activities will be (i) local training courses in finance, accounting, and other areas \nrelevant to electricity regulation; (ii) visits to regulatory commissions of other Indian states; and \n(iii) seminars and workshops in Assam. In parallel to this, the legal and regulatory expert will \nreview the framing of regulations related to the general conduct of AERC\u2019s affairs and discharge \nof its functions to ensure that AERC functions in a transparent manner.  \n \n12.  Phase 2 will start once ADB considers AERC properly staffed under the reform act, and \nable to receive full technical assistance.  A team of international consultants will undertake full \ncapacity-building  support.  Key  activities  will  include  (i)  developing  tariff  principles  and \nprocedures;  (ii)  supporting  a  review  of  tariff  proposals;  (iii)  developing  technical  codes, \n                                                 \n7  The autonomy of a state electricity regulatory commission (SERC) can be strengthened and more transparency in \nappointment of its members will be ensured if it is constituted under a state reform act rather than the Electricity \nRegulatory Commissions Act 1998 (SERC Act). As the SERC Act is a central government law, a state government \nmay choose not to constitute a SERC. Even after the constitution of a SERC, the state government can at any time \nissue notification terminating its continuation. Furthermore, the SERC Act has no detailed provision regarding the \nqualification, status, condition of appointment of members of a SERC, which are considered essential to ensure \nsufficient autonomy and independence.    ", "4  \nperformance standards, and supply and safety regulations; (iv) developing customer service \ncodes and standards; and (v) providing training8 and operational support.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, consisting of $445,600 in \nforeign exchange and $179,400 in local currency equivalent. ADB will finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost of $445,600 and $54,400 of the local currency cost for a total of $500,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. SGA will finance the remaining local currency cost of $125,000 in kind, \nconsisting of various services indicated in para. 15. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix \n2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.       The Department of Power of SGA will be the principal Executing Agency and AERC will \nbe the Implementing Agency. In phase 1, SGA and AERC will jointly prepare and submit to ADB \na proposal for training programs, seminars and workshops, and visits to other regulatory \ncommissions in India for funding under the TA. SGA and AERC will implement these activities \nwithout support from consultants. Phase 2 will be implemented by a team of international \nconsultants including a technical expert (3.5 person-months), a tariff and commercial expert (4.0 \nperson-months), and a human resource and institutional development expert (2.5 person-\nmonths). One of the experts will be designated as team leader and will be responsible for \npreparing the consolidated reports. The consultants will closely collaborate with the legal and \nregulatory expert, who will review the existing business codes and internal regulations of AERC \nand propose necessary changes. ADB will select and engage the consultants in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For selecting a consulting firm, the quality and \ncost-based selection method with the simplified technical proposal will be used.  The terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  AERC  will  provide  office  accommodation,  local  communication  facilities,  and  other \nadministrative support including travel arrangements within Assam for the consultants. SGA and \nAERC will provide all available reports and information related to power sector reforms. The TA \nbudget  provides  for  purchase  of  minimum  office  equipment  to  be  conducted  by  SGA  in \naccordance with ADB's  Guidelines for Procurement and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB. \n \n16.  The TA will be completed in about 20 months, from February 2003 to September 2004. \nIn  phase  1,  AERC  and  SGA  staffs  visiting  regulatory  commissions  and  participating  in \nworkshops and seminars outside Assam will prepare and submit a brief report to ADB. Phase 2 \nis expected to start in June 2003. An inception report outlining the consultant\u2019s approach and \nmethodology for the phase 2 will be prepared within 3 weeks of the start of work and will be \ndiscussed at a tripartite meeting to be attended by representatives of AERC, SGA, ADB, the TA \nconsultants and the legal and regulatory expert. A progress report will be prepared quarterly. \nThe progress report will include a report on workshops and seminars held during the 3-month \nperiod. A draft final report will be prepared 12 months after the start of work. Each report will be \ndiscussed at a tripartite meeting. The final report will be submitted within 1 month after the draft \nfinal  report  is  discussed  in  a  tripartite  meeting.  The  consultants  and  ASEB  will  organize \n                                                 \n8 Training to be provided in the first phase will continue in the second phase with support of the consultants.
