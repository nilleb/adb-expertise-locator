INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  2007  technical  assistance  (TA)  program  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) includes a regional TA to produce a development framework \nfor sustainable urban transport.1 The developing member countries (DMCs) are seeking a new, \nstrategic paradigm for sustainable transport systems in their urban areas. This TA responds to \nboth  the  DMCs\u2019  demands  and  the  current  and  future  operational  needs  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rapid urbanization, rising incomes, and an explosive increase in the use and number of \nvehicles have worsened traffic congestion in DMC urban areas. As traffic increases, so do the \nconsumption of oil-based fuels and the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Among the \nresults are more pollution, environmental degradation, and a declining quality of life in the cities. \nUnfortunately, ways to address these problems, or to stabilize urban sprawl, or curb the growth \nof private vehicle fleets, appear to be out of reach at the moment. \n \n3.  Weighed down by inefficient allocation of road space, inadequate traffic management, \ninstitutional weaknesses, and insufficient financial resources, the transport systems in most \ncities fail to cope with these tremendous challenges. The development of urban transport has \nbeen made more difficult by minimal efforts to integrate transport planning with land-use, and a \nlack of attention to the enabling environment.2 \n \n4.  The urban poor suffer most from limited access to affordable transport services, ill health \ndue to pollution, and poor road safety. Current urban transport systems rarely plan for the \nspecific needs of vulnerable groups, and are thereby ineffective in reducing poverty. \n \n5.  Important constraints on sustainable urban transport systems in the cities\u2014as well as  \nelements required for success\u2014have been identified through a variety of related ADB activities, \nincluding an ongoing regional TA for sustainable urban transport.3 They showed that one of the \nbiggest mistakes in urban transport is the tendency of governments to design their way out of \nproblems through isolated, large-scale capital projects. Experience has demonstrated that this is \nnot sustainable and, therefore, a poor approach. \n \n6.  Faced with gridlock and a deteriorating quality of life, governments often turn to instant \nsolutions that are doomed to fail. Transport strategies, in those cities that have developed them, \nare often merely lists of priority projects. They contain no strategic vision, coherent policies, or \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 May 2007. The concept clearance \nwas obtained on 27 July 2006. \n2  In most cities, road networks have evolved in an unplanned fashion, and without proper adherence to quality \nstandards. Poor traffic management involves many factors, including a lack of coordination between agencies, and \nthe anemic enforcement of traffic rules and regulations. Public transport systems are not yet adequately developed \nin most cities. Governments\u2019 weak capacities and inefficient institutional frameworks also contribute to the problem. \nConsequently, transport planning and programming are chronically fragmented and largely ad hoc; institutional \narrangements for policy implementation are usually incoherent as well. \n3  These ADB activities include: 2006. Sustainable Urban Transport. Manila (TA 6350); 2001. Clean Air Initiative for \nAsian Cities.  Manila (TA 6016); 2005. Energy Efficiency Initiative Consultation Workshop. Manila (TA 6261); 2006. \nUrban Transport Strategy. Manila (TA 4836-IND); 2005. Preparing the Mega City Sustainable Development \nProject. Manila (TA 4753-PAK);  2006. Preparing the Hanoi Metro Rail System Project. Manila (TA 4900-VIE); and \n2006. Infrastructure Investment Advisory Assistance.

This  brand  of  transport  planning  focuses  on  individual  complexities  rather  than \nexamining the overall problem, and devising an overall strategy.  The strategic void is filled \ninstead with repeated attempts to improve on what already exists, even when this approach is \nineffective and new problems call for adaptation and fresh tactics.  \n \n7.  While much is already known about how to develop sustainable transport, little has been \nachieved. At the root of urban transport problems is an inability to base strategies not only on \nwhat is needed, but also on what can be readily accomplished and communicated effectively to \nstakeholders.4 An uncomfortable gap exists between planning and practice. Ambitious wish lists \ndo not factor in what the public sector can afford, with the result that much is planned but little \ngets done. Planning has a narrow, technical focus, proceeds without strategic deliberation, and \nproduces forecasts that are not \u201cfit-for-purpose.\u201d \n \n8.  What is needed now is an integrated vision that combines various strands of transport \nconcerns in a program of activities. Therefore, it is urgent to set a new paradigm based on best \npractices. The paradigm should consist of (i) a long-term vision for sector management, without \nwhich little can happen; (ii) coherent transport policies that define what must be done; and (iii) \nfinancing that depends on policy, and that constrains policy as well. This new paradigm should \nharness sufficient resources to confront the scale of these problems. The vision should present \nstrategic directions for sustainable transport. A strategic framework should address how to \ndeliver that vision. \n \n9.  The regional TA on sustainable urban transport5 confirmed that efforts to cobble together \ntransport policies, planning, and programming must be guided, informed, and improved by this \nkind of clear, long-term vision and strategy. The challenges cities face are issues of regional \nand global importance, and the TA noted that the DMCs have made strong demands for a \ndevelopment  framework  at  the  strategic  and  regional  levels.  Consultations  with  operations \ndepartments  in  ADB  also  supported  the  need  for  a  strategic  regional-level  framework  for \nsustainable transport. \n \n10.  Existing work indicated the following requirements: (i) the city government\u2019s substantial \npowers to raise revenues; (ii) the central government\u2019s enforcement of accountability of city \ngovernments; (iii) planning based on affordability, not on an automatic or unrealistic assumption \nthat financing will follow; (iv) planning to produce credible forecasts of demand, revenues, and \ncosts; and (v) the reasonable allocation of project risks between the private and public sectors, \nand the willingness of the private sector to finance projects. \n \n11.  The proposed TA will (i) provide a vision with directions for sustainable urban transport, \nand (ii) develop a strategic regional level framework for sustainable urban transport. The TA will \n                                                 \n4  For example, a common approach to urban transport policy is \u201cforecast and provide.\u201d In many cases, however, this \napproach is better described as \u201cforecast and do little.\u201d Although the capacity to deliver the infrastructure exists, \nthere is insufficient implementation, which brings only temporary relief.  \n5  TA 6350: Sustainable Urban Transport is to assist pilot cities in developing a road map and the project concepts in \nline with ADB strategy and requirements. The pilot cities include Changzhou, Colombo, Dhaka, Harbin, and \nKathmandu. TA 6350 demonstrates a common set of the challenges most cities are struggling to address. It also \nshows that the development of sustainable transport systems has been hampered by the lack of a suitable \nenabling environment, unrealistic programs, poorly structured projects, and the absence of a coherent vision on \nwhich to develop integrated transport solutions. The tendency has been to provide piecemeal interventions that do \nlittle to address the burgeoning demand for travel. Guidance is urgently required to develop a well-reasoned vision, \nsupported by integrated program evaluation, which will provide decision makers with the tools to make the right \ndecisions for delivery of sustainable urban transport. \n ", "  3\nbuild on existing work, including the regional TA on sustainable urban transport. A strategic-\nlevel development framework will be formulated, with a focus on the key concerns and elements \nidentified in existing work.6 The strategic-level framework will serve as an objective basis for \ndeveloping sustainable transport systems, thereby ensuring sound transport planning, policy \nand programming for the city. The new paradigm will be presented at a strategic level. Applying \nthe paradigm to individual urban areas will require flexibility to fit the particular circumstances of \ncities across the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA is to promote sustainable development through sustainable urban \ntransport systems in the region. The outcome of the TA will be to improve the way cities address \nand provide for the increasing demand for travel, by utilizing long-term visions and packaged \nprograms  of  sustainable  transport  systems  that  can  move  people,  goods,  and  services \nefficiently.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will provide these key elements: (i) a strategic vision, with clear-cut directions for \nsustainable urban transport; (ii) a strategic regional development framework for sustainable \nurban transport; and (iii) a regional action plan for clean and efficient energy use in transport. \nThe long-term strategic vision will be a basis for credible and clear development targets, provide \nintegrated transport solutions, encourage and promote social inclusion, and mitigate negative \nexternalities. The strategic development framework will help DMCs in developing effective and \nrealistic transport solutions to meet the growing demand for travel. The framework will also \nmitigate the negative externalities of pollution, accidents, and climate change, while ensuring \nequitable access and mobility for all. Future activities will be realigned based on the paradigm to \nbe developed under the TA.  \n \n14.  The  strategic  regional  development  framework  will  have  three  dimensions:  policy, \nprogramming, and financing. Coherent policies, derived from a holistic vision of sustainable \ntransport, will be constructed on sound analysis and clear principles that complement each \nother and lead to sustainable economic growth, environmental sustainability, and inclusive \nsocial development. \n \n15.  Issues to be addressed in the framework\u2019s policy agenda will include (i) reducing the \nneed for travel, (ii) shifting mode choice towards nonmotorized transport (NMT) and public \ntransport, (iii) increasing energy efficiency and combating climate change, (iv) reducing air \npollution, and (v) reducing poverty. Policy interventions will involve (i) improving NMT and bus \nservices, (ii) segregating public transport, (iii) restraining private vehicle use, (iv) managing the \nroad network, (v) setting the prices and regulations for public transport, (vi) charging for road \nuse,  (vii)  securing  sector  funding,  (viii)  developing  the  road  network,  (ix)  planning  for  city \nexpansion, and (x) promoting efficient vehicles and fuels. \n \n16.  Among the social elements of the policy agenda will be  (i) the travel needs of the poor \nor the disadvantaged and their major transport modes\u2014walking, paratransit, and bus services, \n(ii) the role of transport policy in poverty reduction, (iii) managing the road network in favor of the \n                                                 \n6  Each city may refine or design specific guidelines later on according to its needs. \n ", "4   \npoor, (iv) rethinking megaprojects, (v) the participation of the urban poor in urban transport, and  \n(vi) implementation.7 All the issues on the policy agenda need to fall within the scope of the \nsame policy tools. \n \n17.  The  framework  will  address  these  broadly  identified  financing  areas  in  which \ngovernments could intervene to bring about desired policy outcomes: (i) context and approach; \n(ii) funding, financing, and affordability; (iii) private sector development, especially the role of \nprivate sector, enabling environment, and new modes; and (iv) innovative financing.  \n \n18.  An action plan will be developed for GHG reduction on a regional level. It will be \ndesigned to (i) improve access to goods and services through an integrated urban plan, (ii) \nreduce  the  fuel  consumed  per  passenger-kilometer  or  freight-kilometer,  (iii)  establish  and \nimplement fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles, (iv) increase the use of GHG-friendly \nbiofuels for road transport, and (v) improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles. \n \n19.  Building on past and current activities, the TA will enhance ADB\u2019s ability to engage in \npolicy dialogue with DMCs, and deliver lending and TA projects in key areas of its operations. It \nwill include reviews of successful regional and global experiences, and suggestions on possible \nfuture directions. The strategic framework will be finalized through extensive consultations within \nADB  and  externally  with  governments,  stakeholders,  and  donors.  The  TA  findings  will  be \ndisseminated  widely  through  various  means,  including  publication,  country  consultation \nworkshops, and seminars. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 and will be financed by a grant from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) will be responsible for the overall and day-to-day monitoring \nof TA activities, including supervising and coordinating the consultants\u2019 work. The TA will involve \nADB-wide collaboration with the transport community of practice, regional departments, and \ntheir transport and communications divisions. A technical group, which will be composed of a \nteam leader from RSDD and staff selected from relevant departments within ADB, will supervise \nthe TA work and provide technical guidance through informal discussions.8  \n \n22.  The  TA  will  require  12  person-months  of  services  from  individual  international \nconsultants.  Appendix  3  presents  an  outline  of  the  terms  of  reference.  The  international \nconsultants will provide expertise in (i) urban transport policy and planning, (ii) urban transport, \n(iii)  transport  energy  efficiency,  and  (iv)  urban  transport  poverty.  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n                                                 \n7  Social inclusion is defined as the process of promoting equitable access to the economic and social benefits of \ndevelopment. It requires individuals or groups to participate fully in the society in which they live. \n8  Any specific activity funded by this TA will commence in a particular DMC only after ADB has received a no-\nobjection in writing from the government of the DMC. \n ", "  5\n23.  The TA is expected to begin in January 2008 and be completed by August 2008. The \nconsultants will submit the following reports to ADB: (i) inception report, 2 weeks after the start \nof services; (ii) interim report, 10 weeks after commencement; (iii) draft final report, 14 weeks \nafter the start of services; and (iii) final report, 3 weeks after receiving all comments. \n \nIV.

The technical assistance (TA) will require about 12 person-months of services from \nindividual international consultants. Under the guidance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nTA team, the consultants will build on the findings of existing work and produce a strategic \ndevelopment framework for sustainable transport at the regional level. The consultants will \nprovide (i) a strategic vision, with clear-cut directions for sustainable urban transport; (ii) a \nstrategic development framework; and (iii) a regional action plan for clean and efficient energy \nuse in transport. \n \n2.  The consultants will ensure that TA outputs will enhance ADB\u2019s ability to engage in \npolicy dialogue with the selected developing member countries (DMCs) and deliver lending and \nTAs in some key areas of its operations. The consultants will also review successful regional \nand global experiences, while suggesting possible future directions. Under the guidance of the \nADB TA team, the consultants will organize extensive consultation workshops and seminars, \ninviting national and municipal governments, stakeholders, and development partners. \n \nB.  Consultants \n \n1.  Urban Transport Policy and Planner (5 person-months) \n \n3.  The  transport  specialist  role  is  to  guide  the  work  and  incorporate  the  themes  of \nsustainable economic growth, environmental improvement, and inclusive social development. \nThrough the development of a strategic framework, policies, programs, and financing options for \nsuccessful and sustainable urban transport solutions will be defined. Strategic solutions will be \nbased  on  credible  and  clear  development  visions,  provide  integrated  transport  solutions, \nencourage and promote social inclusion, and mitigate negative externalities.  \n \n4.  The strategic framework will have three dimensions: policy, programming, and financing. \nIt will suggest types and modes of transport infrastructure, transport systems, and implementing \narrangements that meet the refined sustainability criteria. The work will be relevant so that the \nsubsequent phase will identify readily sustainable transport solutions for site- or location-specific \ninterventions.  The  framework  will  highlight  issues  and  mitigating  measures,  and  define \nstrategies to meet the demands of the urban transport sector. \n \n5.  The key tasks will include but not be limited to the following areas: \n \n(i)  Review existing approaches for development of city-level strategies and master \nplans and identify their weaknesses; \n(ii)  Outline the key issues and constraints facing the transport sector in urban areas. \n(iii)  Define  potential  measures  to  address  these  identified  issues,  including  their \nrelevance for sustainable urban transport; \n(iv)  Provide a clear vision for sustainable urban transport, which will provide the basis \nof a transport policy, planning and programming; \n(v)  Highlight the interrelationship of project and program interventions over time, and \nbetween transport modes, as the basis of a strategic vision for transport; \n(vi)  Explore the need for flexibility within the changing environment of the transport \nsector and, in collaboration with the transport policy specialist, propose measures \nto incorporate necessary mechanisms in policy changes and programming; \n ", "10   Appendix 3 \n \n(vii)  In  collaboration  with  other  team  members,  develop  a  comprehensive  and \ncohesive strategic framework that addresses all the identified concerns, as well \nas improved and inclusive infrastructure and service delivery; \n(viii)  Propose specific areas of actions that will address (a) the need for travel, (b) \nmode integration of travel, (c) the externalities of transport, and (d) travel and \nmobility for all; \n(ix)  Policy agenda in the framework should include these issues: (a) reducing the \nneed for travel, (b) shifting mode choice towards nonmotorized transport (NMT) \nand  public  transport,  (c)  increasing  energy  efficiency  and  combating  climate \nchange, (d) reducing air pollution, and (e) poverty;  \n(x)  Specific policy interventions in the policy agenda should involve (a) improving \nNMT and bus services, (b) segregating public transport, (c) restraining private \nvehicle use, (d) managing the road network, (e) setting the prices and regulations \nfor public transport, (f) charging for road use, (g) securing sector funding, (h) \ndeveloping the road network, (i) planning for city expansion, and (j) promoting \nefficient vehicles and fuels; \n(xi)  Populate the strategic framework with relevant challenges, issues, solutions, and \nfinancing options to ensure integrated and progressive decision making. \n(xii)  Develop  a  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  sustainable  transport \ninitiative, which will help measure performance, and suggest a potential need for \nthe realignment of policies and programming; \n(xiii)  Develop best practice examples for sustainable urban transport; and \n(xiv)  Suggest specifications for a risk management system to identify key risks facing \nurban transport in the changing environment, and provide measures to mitigate \nthe risks. \n \n    2.  Urban Transport Specialist (4 person-months) \n \n6.  With the prime objective of developing policy requirements, institutional capacity, and \nsuitable financial structure for sustainable and integrated transport solutions, the transport policy \nspecialist  will  develop  a  strategic  vision,  structured  policy,  and  program  development  for \nsustainable urban transport. Particular attention is required to demonstrate the benefits strategic \npolicies have in delivering sustainable urban transport visions to promote sustainable economic \ngrowth, environmental sustainability, and inclusive social development. Policy and program \ndevelopment requirements must promote holistic and integrated urban transport infrastructure \nand services to ensure efficient and effective operations through well-reasoned and financed \nprogramming solutions. Policy and planning requirements will be provided to the urban transport \nspecialist for inclusion in the strategic framework. \n \n7.  Strategic policies, derived from a holistic vision of sustainable urban transport, will be \ndeveloped that can be adapted to city transport infrastructure and systems.
