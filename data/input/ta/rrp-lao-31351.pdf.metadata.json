It is designed to promote \nagricultural commercialization2 through extension and training and \nto support the growth of value-added enterprises by improving \naccess  to  information  and  markets  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for investments in agribusinesses. The Project will \naddress  key  constraints  regarding  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness  of  the  agriculture  sector  that  impact  on  the \nincome of small farmers and economic growth of the Lao PDR, \nincluding providing for strategic road linkages to the East-West \nand  North-South  corridors,  where  commerce  and  trade  are \nbeginning to develop. The Project will help to improve the living \nstandards  of  rural  populations  in  selected  districts  of \nSavannakhet,  Champassak,  Khammouan,  and  Vientiane  by \nreinforcing  recent  gains  from  increased  rice  production  and \npromoting  commercial  agricultural  growth.  In  line  with  the \ndecentralization strategy of the Government, provincial and district \nadministrations will be used in implementation of the Project.  \n   \nRationale   Agriculture is the Lao PDR's dominant sector, accounting for half \nof gross domestic product and more than 85% of employment. \nOver 85% of people in the country live in rural areas, making a \nliving largely by subsistence cultivation of rice. Fifty-three percent \nof the rural population live in poverty. The incidence of poverty, \nwhich  is  closely  linked  to  agricultural  performance,  can  be \nreduced by moving farmers beyond subsistence farming to more \ndiversified and commercial agricultural production of a number of \ncash  crops  with  ready  markets  in  neighboring  countries.  The \nirrigated floodplain of the Mekong produces most of the country\u2019s \nmarketable  surplus  of  rice  and  other  crops  and  offers  the \nstrongest potential at present for commercialization of agriculture. \nHowever, even in these areas, rice productivity is below that of its \nneighbors,  and  the  productivity  and  quality  of  nonrice  crops \nremain  low  because  of  limited  information  on  markets,  low \ntechnical expertise, restricted access to markets for inputs and \nproducts,  unavailability  of  credit,  low  domestic  demand,  and a \n   \n                                                 \n1  To be classified as a poverty intervention, incomes of at least 39% of project beneficiaries\u2014the percentage of poor \nin the country\u2014should be below the national poverty line. Under the Project, only about 31% of project clients are \nconsidered poor.  \n2  Agricultural commercialization includes smallholder cash crop production, diversification, and marketing. ", "iii \n  dearth of value-adding enterprises.  As well, the extension system \nhas  been  largely  dysfunctional  because  of  severe  budget \nconstraints,  poor  organization  and  staffing,  and  a  policy \nenvironment not conducive to supporting the efficient functioning \nof input and product markets. By providing relatively simple inputs, \na  large  impact  can  be  achieved  mainly  through  training, \nawareness raising, and application of appropriate policies. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The purpose of the Project is to promote commercial smallholder \nagriculture  and  associated  agribusiness,  with  the  overall \nobjectives of achieving sustained increases in rural incomes and \nlong-term reductions in rural poverty. Specific objectives are to (i) \nachieve increased production and marketing of diversified, nonrice \ndry-season  cash  crops,  livestock,  and  fisheries;  (ii)  improve \nsmallholder  access  to  domestic  and  international  markets  and \nmarket information; and (iii) increase investment in value-adding \nagribusiness.  \n \nTo achieve these objectives, the Project has four components: \n(i) farmer  support  services  to  improve  farmers\u2019  technical \nknowledge of integrated farming systems, and access to market \ninformation  and  inputs;  (ii)  agribusiness  and  marketing  to \nstimulate investment in agribusinesses; (iii) rural infrastructure to \nimprove  physical  access  to  produce  markets  and  reduce \nmarketing costs; and (iv) project management. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project over 6 years is estimated at $15.2 \nmillion  equivalent,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies, \ninterest during construction, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, \n$6.5 million or 43% is foreign exchange cost and $8.7 million \nequivalent or 57% is local currency cost. \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\n  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange Currency Cost \n         \nADB  6.5  5.5  12.0  78% \nGovernment  0.0  3.2   3.2  22% \n     Total  6.5  8.7  15.2  100% \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  9.092  million  ($12.0  million \nequivalent) will be made from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nSpecial Funds resources and will have a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years. An interest charge of 1% will be levied on \nthe loan during the grace period, and 1.5% during the amortization \nperiod. The Borrower will be the Government of the Lao PDR.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 October 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 April 2009 \nCompletion Date ", "iv \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) \n   \nImplementation  A national project director (NPD) will be responsible for overall \nArrangements  execution  of  the  Project,  including  procurement,  project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  reporting,  audit,  and \nfinancial management. A national project steering committee will \nbe established consisting of representatives from MAF; Ministry of \nCommunication,  Transport,  Post  and  Construction;  Ministry  of \nCommerce;  Committee  for  Planning  and  Cooperation;  and  the \nprovincial vice governors, and will be chaired by the vice minister \nof MAF. It will meet twice a year. The provincial governments will \nestablish  provincial  project  offices  (PPOs)  to  implement  and \ncoordinate project activities to be undertaken by the respective \nprovincial departments. \n \n  Each  provincial  governor  will  designate  a  provincial  project \ncoordinator to head the PPO. A provincial steering committee will \nbe established in each province, chaired by the vice governor. \nThe provincial agriculture and forestry services will implement the \nfarmer  support  services  component,  while  the  provincial \ndepartment of construction, transport, post, and communication \nwill implement the rural infrastructure component involving road \nconstruction and rehabilitation, and primary market construction. \nThe  provincial  department  of  commerce  and  department  of \nindustry  and  handicrafts  will  implement  the  agribusiness  and \nmarketing component. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB \nloan will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will be procured \nby international competitive bidding where the cost is valued at \nmore  than  $500,000  equivalent,  or  by  international  shopping \nwhere the cost is valued from $100,000 to $500,000 equivalent. \nEquipment or materials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent \nmay be procured under direct purchase. The civil works for road \nrehabilitation will be procured in accordance with local competitive \nbidding procedures among prequalified private local contractors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Because  labor-based  machine-assisted \nconstruction technology will be employed, prequalification will be \ncontingent to the contractor\u2019s attending training workshops to be \nconducted  at  project  commencement  by  International  Labour \nOrganisation  (ILO)  specialists  concerning  the  construction \nmethodology. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide about 44 person-months of international \nand  146  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  for \nproject  management  and  a  number  of  technical  inputs.  The \namount  of  consulting  services  identified  under  the  Project  is \nconsidered   necessary  in view  of  the  limited  human  resources \n   ", "v \n  capacity and technical expertise available in the Government at \nthe central, provincial, and district levels. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. For consulting services \nrelated to labor-based machine-assisted construction technology, \na contract will be negotiated directly with ILO, which has extensive \nexperience  in  this  technical  area  and  has  been  providing \nassistance to similar projects throughout the Mekong region for \nseveral years.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Technical  assistance  (TA)  of  $250,000  will  be  provided  for \nagribusiness  and  training  to  help  the  NPD  identify  viable  and \ncreditworthy  investments  and  provide  training  to  investors  in \nmarket analysis, business plan preparation, feasibility studies, and \nloan applications from commercial banks. The TA will also provide \nsupport  for  training  of  potential  agribusiness  investors  in \nagrobusiness  processing,  including  study  tours  to  selected \nagribusinesses  in  ASEAN  countries.  Ten  person-months  of \nconsultant  services  for  agribusiness  support  and  training \nconsultant will be provided, and 30 agribusiness investors will be \ntrained.  The  consultants  under  the  TA  are  to  be  engaged  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to the ADB with respect to \nthe use of domestic consultants. \n   \nProject  Benefits  and  The Project has an estimated base case economic internal rate of \nBeneficiaries  return  (EIRR)  of  20%.  About  40,000  smallholder  households, \nprimarily  farmers,  living  in  the  Mekong  floodplains  will  benefit \ndirectly from the Project. The bulk of project benefits will come \nfrom  incremental  production  of  rice,  dry  season  field  and \nvegetable crops, reduced postharvest losses, reduced marketing \ncosts, reductions in transport costs, as well as nonproject farmer \nadoption  of  improved  practices  and  high-yielding  crops. \nNonquantified benefits include those from livestock and fisheries \ndemonstrations,  greater  levels  of  smallholder  technical  and \nbusiness  skills,  greater  levels  of  agribusiness  activities,  and \nimproved social cohesion. The Project is relatively robust \u2013 a 20% \nincrease in cost results in a decline of project EIRR to 17.0%\u2014\nand risk-free\u2014the probability of the actual EIRR being less than \nthe  opportunity  cost  of  capital  is  low.  The  estimated  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  about  18%.  The  proposed  project \ninterventions are financially viable and sufficiently attractive at the \nfarm level to encourage smallholder participation. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The methodologies for participatory extension under the farmer \nsupport  services  component  piloted  under  the  Pilot  Extension \nProject and the proposed labor-intensive technology, developed \nby ILO under the rural infrastructure component have been field \ntested   and   proven   in   the   Lao PDR.   The   success   of    the\n   ", "vi \n  agribusiness  and  marketing  component  will  depend  on \nimprovements  in  the  business-enabling  environment  and  the \nability to mobilize agribusiness investments. Implementation of a \nsupportive enabling environment will be the subject of specific \nassurances and loan covenants, and will be monitored closely. It \nis expected that substantial benefits will accrue to project farmers \nand the country with the implementation of these components. \n \nAlthough the Government has assured ADB that the Agricultural \nPromotion Bank (APB) will provide financial services to the project \nparticipants, the ongoing reforms of APB and the financial sector \npromoted by ADB and other aid agencies may constrain lending \nby APB and other banks. Lack of financial services and credit to \nundertake  income-generating  activities  and  agro-based \nenterprises arising from developments under the Project pose a \nrisk to its overall success. \n \nUncertainties  relating  to  the  legal  and  policy  framework  for \nbusinesses will be mitigated by encouraging businesses and the \nGovernment to consult each other in a forum to be created and \nsupported  by  the  Project  and  TA  and  for  the  Government  to \nrespond speedily to justified complaints. \n   \n ", "vii \n ", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Smallholder Development Project. \nThe report also describes technical assistance (TA) for Agribusiness Support and Training, and \nif the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve this TA grant. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Government\u2019s development goal is to reduce poverty by half by 2005 and for the \nLao PDR to graduate from the status of least developed country by 2020. The Government \ntargets broad-based economic growth of 6\u20137% per annum over the next 5 years. The strategic \napproach  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  human  and  rural  development,  and  people\u2019s \nparticipation, focusing on (i) agriculture and forestry, (ii) education, (iii) health, and (iv) road \ninfrastructure. To achieve its ambitious objectives with limited financial and human resources, \nthe  Government  will  need  to  accelerate  economic  development  through  private  sector  or \nprivate-public  initiatives,  which  will  in  turn  contribute  significantly  to  its  poverty  reduction \nprogram.  Following  the  admission  of  the  Lao  PDR  to  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations (ASEAN), considerable potential to exploit export markets has been created. This would \nimprove with the scheduled 2005 implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and \nentry into the World Trade Organization. As well, the development of the East-West Corridor of \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)\u2014comprising the central provinces of central Myanmar, \nnortheastern and northwestern Thailand, lower Lao PDR, and central Viet Nam\u2014represents an \narea of very high potential for the development of agroindustries, from which the Lao PDR can \npotentially benefit.  \n \n  1.  Agriculture  \n \n3.  Agriculture is the Lao PDR's dominant sector, accounting for half of gross domestic \nproduct and more than 85% of employment. About 95% of the rural population is dependent on \nagricultural production, mainly rice, for a living. The majority of Lao farmers practice subsistence \nagriculture, and poverty is widespread. While the national poverty rate is 39%, the rate in rural \nareas is 44%, with the rural poor making up 87% of the total poor.3 Rice is cultivated by over \n80%  of  the  population,  mainly  for  their  own  food  use.  Rice  yields  are  still  low  by  Asian \nstandards; national average yields are within the relatively low range of 1.5\u20133.0 tons per hectare \n(ha) compared with 6\u20137 tons/ha in other countries. See Appendix 1 for the sector analysis. \n \n4.  The irrigated areas on the floodplains of the Mekong and its tributaries produce most of \nthe country\u2019s marketable surplus of rice and other crops. About one fourth of households in this \nregion grow maize, and about a third grow some vegetable crops, either in irrigated fields, \nkitchen  gardens,  or  along  riverbanks.  Commonly  grown  vegetables  include  chili,  cabbage, \ncucumber, eggplant, and onion. Other nonrice crops include sugar cane, peanut, tobacco, \nsesame, and fruit trees (most notably mango and tamarind). Although most households depend \n                                                 \n3 1997/98 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS 2). The Government has defined poverty, by Prime \nMinister decree No. 10/PMM dated March 2002, such that poor households have a monthly per capita expenditure \nof less than KN85,000 based on 2001 prices. ", "2 \non sources other than rice for their income, commercial agricultural diversification in the Lao \nPDR has still not fully taken root.  \n \n5.  While,  in  1990,  rice  production  was  1.3  million  tons,  with  the  help  of  considerable \ninvestment in minor irrigation in recent years and improvement in rice production technology \nwith the assistance of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), this increased by 50% \nduring  the  1990s  and  reached  2.3  million  tons  in  2001;  but  production  remains  below  its \npotential. While remote and mountainous areas still face seasonal food shortages, the country \nas a whole has achieved self-sufficiency in rice. With two of the country\u2019s neighbors, Viet Nam \nand Thailand, being dominant low-cost rice producers in the international market, the Lao PDR\u2019s \ncompetitive advantage lies in nonrice niche markets. However, nonrice crop production and \nquality remain low even in the most highly productive agricultural areas. \n \n2.  Agricultural Extension and Marketing \n \n6.  Since the revolution in 1975, public sector extension in the Lao PDR has been vertically \nstructured from the central to the district levels. At the top, the Ministry of Agriculture and \nForestry (MAF) is organized by line departments (e.g., irrigation, forestry, crops, and livestock). \nIn each of the 18 provinces and 139 districts, the central structure is mirrored in the provincial \nagriculture  and  forestry  services  (PAFSs)  and  the  district  agriculture  and  forestry  offices \n(DAFOs), respectively. This structure has been in place for some 26 years. Although the PAFSs \nand  DAFOs  employ  collectively  some  6,000  persons,  lack  of  staff  capacity  and  operating \nbudgets have severely constrained their functions, rendering them dysfunctional. The main \nfunctions of DAFOs, in the past, have been to collect production data, regulate activities related \nto  land  and  forest  allocations  and  issue  permits,  and  organize  village  labor  for  basic \ninfrastructure construction. Very limited technical assistance to farmers has been provided, and \nvery little has been aimed at assisting farmers improve their productivity. \n \n7.  However, since the mid-1990s, several initiatives by aid agencies have demonstrated \nviable models for strengthening extension in the Lao PDR. With assistance under ADB TA \n1745-LAO and TA 2333-LAO (Institutional Development and Strengthening of the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Forestry) in 1993, and several donors, a national strategy for extension through \nfarming systems extension workers (FSEW) was developed. This concept was pilot tested in \nfour districts between 1994 and 1997 under the Pilot Extension Project (PEP), financed by the \nSwiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) through the Novartis Foundation. The \nconcept of FSEW departed from the traditional assignment of staff at the district level to focus \non a generalist farming systems approach in assigned groups of villages. The approach to \nextension  built  around  the  National  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Extension  Service  (NAFES) \nunderpinning  the  human  resource  development  component  of  the  Government\u2019s  Strategic \nVision  for  the  Agricultural  Sector  was  presented  to  the  international  aid  community  in \nNovember 1999. \n \n8.  The Lao marketing chain for agricultural produce is underdeveloped, with significant \ngaps in critical areas such as inadequacy of primary markets, inadequate business support, and \nabsence  of  business  commodity  traders  except  for  rice  and  livestock.  There  are  also \nconstrained and inadequate mechanisms for efficient cross-border trading. Despite the setting \nup of AFTA to facilitate the free movement of goods and services, compliance with AFTA is \ninadequate or non-existent in many areas. \n \n \n ", "  3 \n  3.  Rural Financial Institutions \n \n9.  The Lao financial sector currently comprises the specialized state-owned Agricultural \nPromotion Bank (APB), three state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs),4 three joint venture \nbanks  (JVBs),5  and  eight  foreign  commercial  banks  (FCBs).6  APB  is  the  only  significant \ninstitutional source of rural finance at present. APB reaches rural households mainly through \ncredit groups and has reportedly established 20,000 such groups with an average membership \nof seven families per group. APB operates three branches in Louang Phrabang, Savannakhet, \nand Champassak; 47 service units in rural areas; and six subservice units in Vientiane Province. \nThe SOCBs have branches in several provinces, while the JVBs and FCBs have no branches \nand hence no provincial outreach other than in the area around Vientiane Municipality. \n \n10.  As of 31 December 2001, outstanding loans for agriculture in all banks totaled the \nequivalent of about $30 million, of which $9 million was outstanding from the SOCBs, about $20 \nmillion from APB, and the rest from the JVBs and FCBs. APB is the premier agricultural finance \ninstitution, whose portfolio is predominantly in agriculture and agribusiness. At the end of 2001, \nAPB had total assets of $29 million equivalent (KN277 billion), of which cash and deposits \ncomprised $3.9 million (KN37 billion), outstanding loans $20 million (KN190 billion), and fixed \nand other assets totaled $5.3 million (KN50 billion). Outstanding loans comprised about $11.6 \nmillion (KN110 billion) in short-term lending for production and $8.4 million (KN80 billion) in \nmedium-  and  long-term  loans.  APB\u2019s  liabilities  comprised  $11.6  million  (KN91  billion)  in \ndemand, savings, and short-term fixed deposits, $1 million (KN10 billion) in 2-year certificates of \ndeposit (which is earmarked for policy lending), about $4.9 million (KN47 billion) in multilateral \ndevelopment institution credit lines,7 $6.3 million or 20% (KN60 billion) in capital, and $5.2 \nmillion (KN50 billion) in other liabilities. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problem Analysis8 \n11.  Agriculture Sector Issues. Rice is the dominant crop, occupying 68% of the total \ncultivated  area  (of  1.8  million  ha,  according  to  satellite  imagery).  Other  annual  crops  and \npermanent crops account for only 9% and 8%, respectively, highlighting the predominant role of \nrice and of subsistence farming in the Lao PDR agricultural economy. Agricultural productivity is \nlow due to inefficient practices, low input use, and low farm mechanization. This is primarily due \nto the predominance of subsistence-oriented rice production whereby farmers adopt low input \nmethods to meet subsistence needs at minimal cost. Only 28% of households used chemical \nfertilizers in 1999, and less than one third of households use any form of mechanization. Low \ntechnical expertise; limited access to domestic and international markets for inputs and outputs; \nlack of access to market information; constraints to export, inter-provincial, and external trade; \nlow domestic demand; and the dearth of local agribusinesses are some of the main reasons \nwhy  agricultural  production  has  been  inefficient.  Limited  human  resource  capacity,  poor \n                                                 \n4  Bank pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao, Lane Xang Bank, and Lao May Bank \n5  Joint Development Bank, Lao-Viet Bank, and Vientiane Commercial Bank \n6  Public Bank (Malaysia), Bangkok Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Krung Thai Bank, Siam Commercial Bank, Thai Farmers \nBank, and Thai Military Bank (all Thai banks), all of which have branch offices in Vientiane. Standard Chartered \nBank has a representative office and only provides offshore guarantee facilities for overseas clients doing business \nin Lao PDR. \n7  This comprises about KN42 billion from ADB, KN5 billion from the International Fund for Agricultural Development, \nand KN0.3 billion from the European Union. \n8  See Appendix 2 for problem and objective tree analyses. ", "4 \nagricultural support and delivery services, and lack of medium- and short-term credit and other \nfinancial services hamper agricultural development. As well, the high cost of transportation \nbecause of lack of physical infrastructure is a major constraint to the flow of goods and services. \nSupport for rural infrastructure, especially rural access roads, which link rural areas to larger \nmarkets, is an important intervention to facilitate the flow of technology from market to producer \nand vice versa. \n \n12.  To stimulate growth in agriculture and to raise rural incomes, it is necessary to move \nbeyond subsistence farming to more diversified, commercial agricultural production by assisting \nsubsistence and semicommercial farmers to transit from their present low input systems to more \nproductive,  higher  input,  and  profitable  commercial  farming  systems.  To  facilitate  the \ncommercialization process, an enabling environment for private sector investment, particularly \nin commercial agricultural development to link producers, wholesalers, and retail buyers is \nneeded. Major factors contributing to low agricultural production and diversification include \n(i) limited access to financial services, (ii) underdeveloped and weak research and extension, \n(iii) underdeveloped seed production system and lack of improved seed and planting material, \n(iv) lack of knowledge of improved technology and lack of skill of MAF staff, (v) limited market \noutlets and poor post harvest facilities, and (vi) high cost of transportation and lack of all-\nweather roads. The underdeveloped research and lack of improved seed and planting material, \nwhile not being binding constraints, since these are now readily available from neighboring \ncountries, need to be further studied for future strengthening.  \n \n13.  About half of all households keep buffaloes for draught power, and a third have cattle \n(the average number of cattle per household is higher than that for buffalo, though). Pig raising \nis also common. However, only a third of households currently vaccinate their cattle. The \nlivestock trade with Thailand is significant, but poor cattle and livestock health hamper this trade \nand  expose  farmers  to  the  opportunistic  and  rent-seeking  behavior  of  middlemen  and \nunscrupulous officials. Fish is a major source of protein, accounting for 40% of total protein \nintake. Fish farming is characterized as extensive low density without feeding to semi-extensive \nfarming  with  a  small  amount  of  feeding.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s  support  through  the \noperation of fish stations with hatcheries, mortality rates have been high. The main constraints \nare lack of technical capacity within MAF and lack of a consistent technology for fish breeding.  \n \n14.  Potential agribusiness investors perceive the Lao PDR to be a high-risk country in which \nto conduct business. High costs for registrations, hidden administrative costs, and the weak \nlegal  framework  impose  extra  burdens  in  this  regard.  Nontariff  barriers  and  other  border \nirregularities, and the slow response of Lao farmers to demand compound the constraints to \nagribusiness viability. Partly because of the large component of subsistence agriculture, the \nmarketing system has remained underdeveloped. Interregional distribution is limited to some \nfruits and fish. Regional market prices vary significantly and reflect the poor market information, \npoor quality of produce, poor transport facilities, and licensing requirements.  \n \n15.  Agricultural  Extension  and  Marketing.  Extension  budgets  are  limited,  and  the  main \nfunction of the DAFO has, therefore, been confined to collecting data on production, carrying out \nregulatory  functions,  and  occasionally  mobilizing  villagers  to  construct  basic  infrastructure. \nWhile some assistance to farmers has been provided, such as livestock vaccination, not much \nhas  been  done  to  help  farmers  improve  their  productivity.  However,  there  is  a  growing \nawareness of the importance of extension and the role of MAF in promoting agricultural growth, \nwhich has resulted in the decentralization of the extension system and assistance by bilateral \nand multilateral agencies, such as under the Sustainable Irrigated Agriculture Project, Farmer \nIntegrated Agriculture Training Project, Integrated Pest Management Project, PEP, and ADB TA ", "  5 \n2333-LAO to strengthen MAF. (See Appendix 3 for external assistance.) Recognizing this, the \nGovernment has tried hard to provide more funds for extension activities. External support is \nneeded to operationalize this vision. \n \n16.  Studies show that the weakest link in the marketing chain on the demand side of Lao \nagriculture is the shortage and/or absence of primary markets in many areas.  Primary markets \nare the point of first sale from producers to local consumers and to wholesalers, and the \nabsence of such basic facilities deters farmers from producing for the market and improving \ntheir livelihood. On the supply side, local supply of agricultural inputs is constrained by the \nabsence of primary markets. Shortage of inputs is a major constraint to increasing commercial \nagricultural production. \n \n17.  Accessibility and Availability of Financial Services. Because rural incomes fluctuate \nand a multitude of risks affect income and consumption, rural households need access to \nfinancial services to help stabilize income and consumption and alleviate chronic and transitory \nfood insecurity. Chronic food insecurity can be alleviated by increasing production through the \nprovision  of  credit,  while  transitory  food  security,  which  involves  income  and  consumption \nsmoothing, requires savings and insurance facilities. \n \n18.  Accessibility of rural financial services is important to ensure that farmers and rural \nbusinesses have the wherewithal to adopt new technologies and practices that can improve \ntheir income. In 2000, ADB approved a cluster TA for Rural Finance Development to help \ndevelop  a  sustainable  market-oriented  rural  finance  system  and  to  strengthen  APB.  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  World  Bank,  and  ADB  are  also  currently  collaborating  to \nstrengthen the financial sector (under the World Bank Financial Management Adjustment Credit \nand  the  ADB  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  Loan),  and  the  Government  is  pledging \nsignificant reforms in the enabling environment and banking sector. Under these initiatives, \ncredit lines to APB have been strongly discouraged until these reforms and those relating to \ngovernance,  audit,  disclosure  and  accounting  practices,  risk  management,  and  human \nresources development (supported under ADB TA 3413-LAO) in APB specifically are carried \nout.  \n \n19.  There are currently no regulations for microfinance institutions. There is no specific \ncredit union law. The legal basis for chartering credit unions (or credit cooperatives) is the \nRegulations  on  Credit  Cooperatives,  No.  02/SB,  dated  15  November  1994  issued  by  the \ngovernor of the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL).9 BOL regulations address some areas of credit union \nregistration; powers; governance; prudential standards; supervision; and the general powers of \nsavings and credit unions to acquire, hold, and dispose of assets, to enter into contracts, to offer \ndeposit and loan services, to determine their own interest rates, and to borrow and to invest in \nauthorized  investments.  However,  there  are  several  provisions  still  lacking,  notably  those \nrelated to investment, membership, loan write-off, external audit, external borrowing, and loan \nportfolio concentration. So far, only the Coop\u00e9ratives de Cr\u00e9dits pour le Soutien aux Petites \nUnit\u00e9s de Production, comprising nine partner cooperatives, have successfully formed under \nthis legislation and operated in rural areas, but on a very small scale, reaching only 900 \nmembers and with a loan outstanding of about $140,000 (financed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Investissement \net de D\u00e9veloppement International and the Association pour le Soutien et le D\u00e9veloppement \ndes Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Paysannes au Laos). The Phongsali Decentralized Credit Network in Phongsali \n                                                 \n9 This Regulation is founded on the following: (i) Law No. 04/90 PSA, dated 10 July 1990, on the Establishment of the \nBank of the Lao PDR, promulgated by the Presidential Decree No. 39/PR of 27 July 1990; (ii) Prime Minister\u2019s \nDecree No. 03/PM of 23 January 1992, on the Management of Activities by Commercial Banks and other Financial \nInstitutions; and (iii) Resolution of the meeting of the Bank Council held on 5 September 1994. ", "6 \nDistrict, operating under the credit cooperative regulations of BOL, was established in 1997 in \n5 villages.  It  now  provides  credit  services  in  49  villages,  reaching  about  2,000  families  in \nPhongsali District.  \n \n20.  Policy Constraints. Other weaknesses that plague the financial and business sectors \nrelate to the legal environment. While a framework of legislation for the operation of commercial \nbusinesses  has  been  developed,  there  is  much  uncertainty  regarding  it.  Among  the \nuncertainties are constraints caused by a lack of dissemination of legislation, limits on judicial \ncapacity, incomplete repeal of legislation that is technically no longer in force, overlap between \nlaws and between decrees, uncertainty of title registration procedures, incomplete land titling \nand  associated  high  transaction  costs,  and  time-consuming  legal  processes  in  relation  to \ncontract enforcement and debt recovery. These constraints seriously hinder sound lending by \nbanks and discourage foreign investors and foreign banks. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n21.  With its small population and abundant (but largely untapped) natural resources, the Lao \nPDR is in a strong position to produce goods for export to neighboring markets, which have \nlarge populations with relatively high incomes but suffer land and other resource pressures and \nincreasing urbanization. Just outside the Lao PDR border live at least 200 million people. As \nindustrial development accelerates in these countries, agricultural land resources are shifting to \nthe non-agricultural sectors, and these populations could become major consumers of rice, \nlivestock, vegetables, and other farm produce from the Lao PDR. \n \n22.  Despite  the  constraints  currently  faced  by  Lao  agriculture,  some  Lao  agricultural \ncommodities are exported through unofficial border trade mechanisms to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Thailand, and Viet Nam. These include maize, soybean, groundnut, cotton, tobacco, \nsesame, red bean, cabbage, banana, tamarind, watermelon, mulberry bark and other nontimber \nforest products, buffalo, cattle, and pigs.10 The fact that such trade with neighboring countries \ntakes place suggests that a demand  for some Lao agricultural products exists. Crops identified \nas  having  potential  for  export  and/or  import  substitution  based  on  comparative  advantage \nanalysis are maize, peanut, soybean, sesame, sunflower, sorghum, and safflower for field \ncrops; grape, mandarin, sapodilla, orange, durian, rambutan, cashew, longan, and tamarind for \nfruits; and coffee, sugar cane, cotton, and sericulture among industrial crops. By ensuring that \nAFTA rules are enforced, Lao agricultural produce should be able to enter Thailand and Viet \nNam freely, thereby benefiting farmers from better prices and the country from more trade. \n \n23.  Livestock, an integral part of most family farm systems, contributes to almost half the \naverage income of farmers. The Lao PDR has a comparative advantage among the neighboring \nexport markets, and there is considerable potential to increase livestock production and value \nadded products for export. Major constraints to the expansion of livestock production are lack of \nan integrated program of animal health, nutrition, and breeding; and lack of support services in \nmarketing and market information systems. By improvements in livestock health and mortality \nfarmers can ensure better farm household income. Similarly, Lao PDR can achieve comparative \nadvantage in fish farming, vis-\u00e0-vis its neighbors, by applying the appropriate technology in \nbreeding and rearing of fish. \n \n24.  The  Government  recognizes  that  growth  in  the  Lao  agriculture  sector  has  been \nconstrained by (i) the limited capacity of public sector institutions and human resources; (ii) an \n                                                 \n10 FAO. 2000. Development of Market Information and Marketing Extension Capability. ", "  7 \nunsupportive environment for private sector development; (iii) limited transport, power, and \ncommunications infrastructure; (iv) unavailability of rural finance and undeveloped input and \noutput markets; (v) international trade constraints; (vi) variability in rainfall and incidence of \nfloods; and (vii) the predominance of subsistence agriculture. The Government is therefore \ncommitted to a market-based economy with equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. In \nNovember 1999, the Government presented its strategic vision for the agriculture sector11 at a \nconference of aid agencies. This strategic vision includes a focus on (i) increasing rural incomes \nby developing market-oriented agriculture and improving public institutions and policies to better \nserve this aim; (ii) recognizing the preeminent role of the private sector and working to improve \nthe business and investment environment; (iii) achieving a better balance of investments in the \nsector; and (iv) improving the sustainability of infrastructure investments. The strategy focuses \non improvements in farmer knowledge, awareness, and capacity to increase agricultural output \nand create marketable surpluses to meet growing domestic and regional demand in both local \nand  external  raw  commodity  and  agribusiness  processing  markets.  In  recognition  of  the \nimportance of agricultural extension services, the Government recently increased MAF\u2019s budget \nby 50%. \n \n25.  It is generally recognized that credit in the presence of technology, extension, and \nmarkets can speed up development. In the project areas, farmers and other rural inhabitants \nface difficulty in accessing financial services. This problem is compounded by the restructuring \nof APB and by reforms in the financial sector under ADB\u2019s cluster TA and the Banking Sector \nReform  Program  Loan.  Simple  revision  in  collateral  regulations,  group-based  lending,  and \nproviding  loans  of  appropriate  duration  could  increase  the  coverage  of  farmers  under  the \nProject. By introducing more loan products and innovative financial services, APB could reach \nout  to  traders  and  merchants  supplying  inputs  and  small-scale  machinery  to  farmers. \nMerchants, in turn, could extend credit facilities to project beneficiaries on normal trade credit \nterms. The Law on Cooperatives provides the framework for the creation of credit cooperatives \ninvolving the private sector, which could serve the rural population and promote increased \ncompetition for formal financial institutions. Under the ADB cluster TA, it is proposed to form \ncredit unions under the auspices of APB, after the completion of the ongoing diagnostic study of \nAPB. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n26.  The purpose of the Project is to promote sustainable commercial smallholder agriculture \nand associated agribusiness in the Lao PDR, with the goal of achieving sustained increases in \nrural incomes and long-term reductions in rural poverty.12 The purpose will be achieved by (i) \nincreasing production and marketing of diversified, nonrice dry season cash crops; livestock; \nand fisheries; (ii) improving smallholder access to domestic and international markets and to \nmarket  information;  and  (iii)  increasing  investment  in  value-adding  agribusiness.  See \nAppendix 5 for the project framework.  \n \n27.  The  Project  covers  16  districts  in  four  provinces.  These  include  six  districts  in \nSavannakhet,13 six in Champassak,14 two in Khammouan,15 and two in Vientiane.16 These four \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997.

", "8 \nprovinces currently have the highest potential for commercial agricultural development where \nfactor and product markets are beginning to function and complementary infrastructure such as \nirrigation, roads, electricity, and some agribusiness development are beginning to emerge. As \nwell, they present the most interest to potential foreign investors.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs17 \n1.  Farmer Support Services \n28.  The Project will facilitate the introduction of technologies to intensify and commercialize \nthe production of wet season rice, nonrice cash crops during the dry season, livestock, and \nfisheries. Target beneficiaries include subsistence, semicommercial, and commercial producers \nwith  varying  production  objectives,  resources,  and  other  circumstances.  Farmer  support \nservices  will  need  to  tailor  technology  and  management  packages  according  to  these \ncircumstances in order to increase relevance and adoption rates. The method used will be \nparticipatory selection and adoption of techniques that enable farmers to make sound resource \nmanagement decisions, taking into account the continuously changing environment of an open \nmarket economy. The extension methods for this intervention have been successfully field \ntested under the PEP, financed by SDC. This approach is a farmer demand-driven participatory \nprocess, which will form the basis of the national extension system of NAFES, now under \ndevelopment. \n \n29.  The capacity of the extension staff of the PAFSs and DAFOs will be strengthened \nthrough training and introduction of new technology. The component will develop new market \ninformation and will link with the information systems of MAF and the Ministry of Commerce \n(MOC).  The  PAFSs  and  DAFOs  will  disseminate  to  farmers  improved  crop  and  livestock \ntechnology  and  extension  packages  from  the  National  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Research \nInstitute, IRRI, and extension services in neighboring countries.18 Market information on crops \ntraded in domestic and contiguous markets will also be periodically disseminated. MAF will \nestablish formal contacts with extension offices in neighboring countries to acquire freely offered \nextension packages.19 MAF will promote private sector extension services and input supply by \nhelping to facilitate contract farming arrangements by private agribusinesses. The reach of \nextension mechanisms will be expanded through training for water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) \nand the creation and training of farmer production and marketing groups (FPMGs) in agricultural \nand livestock production technologies and marketing operations, and in conducting participatory \ntrials  and  demonstrations  in  local  areas.  The  Project  will  also  provide  training  for  village \nextension workers selected by farmers to cover all fields of agricultural and livestock production \nand marketing. \n \n30.  The Project will provide community vaccination of animals and demonstrations to reduce \nthe  mortality  of  cattle,  buffalo,  pigs,  and  chickens,  and  will  conduct  dry  season  feeding \ndemonstrations to increase the weight of cattle and buffalo. It will undertake fishpond trials and \ndemonstrations  at  the  district  level  to  promote  wider  adoption  of  aquaculture  to  increase \nhousehold production. To ensure the adoption of new technologies and farming practices crucial \nto the sustainability of their activities, APB will provide financial services to farmers and rural \n                                                 \n15 Thakhek and Nongbok. \n16 Thoulakom and Phonhong. \n17  See Supplementary Appendix B for description of project components. \n18  Lao-IRRI will be engaged to provide support for rice extension training, rice storage demonstrations aimed at \nreducing post-harvest losses at the farm, and commercial rice seed production by selected farmers on 500-600 ha. \n19 The Lao PDR has bilateral agreements with all neighboring countries to freely exchange extension information. ", "  9 \nhouseholds in the project area. APB will also pilot the formation of credit unions20 under the \nCooperative  Act  and  oversee  their  growth  and  operations  with  the  aim  of  strengthening \ngrassroot microfinance initiatives for rural households.21 \n \n2.  Agribusiness and Marketing22  \n31.  The  Project  will  provide  (i)  agribusiness  investment  promotion  through  conferences \norganized by the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industries; (ii) provincial trade fares \nand investment promotion workshops to promote collaboration between producers and value-\nadded industries in Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam; (iii) establishment of Lao agribusiness \nforum for private business and policy makers to discuss legal, regulatory, and other relevant \nissues; (iv) upgrading of MAF\u2019s information system in coordination with MOC and others to \nensure mutual benefit and to avoid duplication; and (v) assistance to MOC\u2019s Trade Promotion \nCenter  to  promote  Lao  products  through  electronic  medium.  National  and  provincial  level \nconferences  and  workshops  will  be  used  to  build  awareness  and  understanding  on  the \nimplementation of policies and related legal and regulatory functions needed to facilitate the \ndevelopment of competitive agribusiness, and allow interaction between public officials and the \nprivate sector on ways to improve their performance. \n \n32.  The Project will support the construction of strategically located primary markets in order \nto encourage expansion of farmer-initiated retail sales within local areas and to promote the \ngrowth and strengthening of wholesale marketing operations by middlemen, who collect and \nconsolidate small quantities of produce from individual farmers for onward transshipment to \ninternal retail marketing points and to cross-border marketing points in neighboring countries. \nMarket locations that will serve as collection, grading, storage, and exchange points for primary \nproduce as well as points for distributing agricultural inputs (fertilizers; seeds; chemicals; tools; \nand small farm machinery including pumps, pedestrian power tillers, harvesters, and threshers) \nwill be identified during project implementation. \n \n33.  To  assist  project  smallholder  farmers  to  acquire  better  understanding  of  markets, \ninformation technology will be used to collect and disseminate, on a weekly basis, market \ninformation on prices and volumes traded in both domestic and contiguous markets to farmers \nthrough DAFOs by developing new market information links through MAF\u2019s information system, \nin coordination with MOC and other relevant ministries and offices. There will be an extensive \neffort  to  develop  and  extend  throughout  the  project  provinces  essential  knowledge  and \nspecifications of international agricultural product grades and standards. \n \n34.  Training  in  market  economics  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Government  National \nOrganization  for  Studies  on  Policy  and  Administration  (NOSPA)  including  (i)  two  1-week \nnational market economics workshops for participants from MAF, MOC, the Ministry of Industry \nand Handicrafts, the Lao Chamber of Commerce and Industries, and the Lao Trade Promotion \nCenter; (ii) four 1-week provincial market economics training workshops for staff of the Office of \n                                                 \n20 As provided under Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for Rural Finance Development. \n21  A TA proposal for JFPR support to provide dedicated funds for social preparation and group formation of poorer \ncommunities in the project area is being prepared as stand-alone assistance. The proposed TA will complement \nthe farmer support services component by supporting the expansion of a local microfinance institution, the \nCoop\u00e9ratives de Cr\u00e9dits pour le Soutien aux Petites Unit\u00e9s de Production and providing training and basic \nequipment to enhance their capacity to deliver microfinance services. The Project will provide the services of \ndomestic and international rural financial services specialists to assist APB in delivering efficient financial services \ndemanded by project beneficiaries. \n22  See Supplementary Appendix C for market study. ", "10 \nthe  Provincial  Governors,  PAFS,  provincial  departments  of  commerce  (DOCs),  provincial \ndepartment of industry and handicrafts (DIHs), and Provincial Chambers of Commerce; (iii) four \n1-week provincial training workshops in market surveying techniques for staff of provincial \nDOCs; and (iv) one 10-day training in agricultural price forecasting for the Planning Division of \nMOC and the Division of Statistics of MAF. \n \n35.  To improve the climate for investment and to facilitate the resolution of problems faced \nby investors, the Project will promote policy dialogue between the business community and the \nGovernment through the development of business forums at the central and local levels. This \ninitiative will complement the training provided under the Project to government functionaries in \nmarket economics and the importance of a supportive policy environment on the one hand, and \nthe financial sector reforms under the Banking Sector Reform Program Loan and cluster TA for \nRural Finance Development of ADB and multilateral agencies on the other. \n \n3.  Rural Infrastructure \n36.  The Project will provide for the rehabilitation of 89.5 kilometers (km) and construction of \n70.8 km of strategic roads, identified as the highest priority rural access roads in the project \narea. These roads will lower transport costs and facilitate the flow of agricultural technology, \ninputs, and produce among production centers, primary markets, and strategic GMS markets. \nThe selected roads link existing west-east and north-south marketing corridors (primarily to \nThailand and Viet Nam, and to the People\u2019s Republic of China) to agricultural areas that have \nthe potential to adopt agriculture and livestock productivity-enhancing technology.23 \n \n37.  These roads are (i) the Pakse-Champassak-Soukhouma-Mounlapamok road (Road 14-\nA), which links the impoverished, but potentially productive, lower Mekong plain of Champassak \nProvince to the highly commercial east-west corridor of Pakxong-Pakse and the Thai border; \n(ii) the Champhone-Xonbuli road in Savannakhet Province, which links the potentially productive \nXonbuli District to the commercially active east-west corridor in Savannakhet that connects to \nthe border region with Thailand; and (iii) the Songkhone-Thapasoun road, which links the \ncommercial center of Songkhone District in Savannakhet Province to a key Mekong River \nborder trading market with Thailand. The selected roads are within the commercially viable \nzones of the three selected agricultural plains, which serve large populations who need access \nto marketing corridors. \n \n4.  Project Management \n38.  The Project will provide administrative support, technical guidance, and monitoring and \nsupervision related to project implementation, including establishment of a project performance \nmonitoring  system  (PPMS)  and  use  of  consultants  for  project  activities.  International  and \ndomestic consultant services will be provided to assist the national project director (NPD) and \nthe  provincial  project  offices  (PPOs)  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels  in \nadministering  and  implementing  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  provide  expert  technical \nadvice in marketing, livestock and fisheries development, socioeconomic baseline and impact \nassessments,  training  of  staff,  and  designing  and  implementing  extension  and  training \nprograms. \n \n                                                 \n23 The importance of the road network to the economic development of the Lao PDR has been discussed in several \nforums, the most recent being the AEM/METI Economic and Industrial Cooperation Committee meeting in \nVientiane on 11 April 2002. ", "  11 \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Synergy with Other Projects \n39.  The Project will work closely with projects financed by ADB and other external agencies, \nsuch as PEP; the Lao Extension and Agriculture Project (LEAP) of SDC; the Mekong Project \nDevelopment Facility (MPDF);24 and NOSPA, which is a Government agency providing training \nin market economics to Lao officials and which is the recipient of Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) assistance. As well, the Project will use the International \nLabour Organisation (ILO) in advising and overseeing the construction of rural roads using \nlabor-based  methodologies,  which  creates  employment  and  foster  a  strong  sense  of  local \nownership.  \n \n40.  The Project will closely coordinate with two ADB-financed projects that are working to \nimprove the functioning of financial markets in the country. The ongoing cluster TA on Rural \nFinance  Development  is  working  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  rural  and \nmicrofinance, identify and roll out needed reforms in APB, and establish three pilot credit \nunions. It is expected that at least two of these credit unions will be established in the project \nareas in due course. The proposed Banking Sector Reform Program Loan will promote needed \nreforms  to  develop  the  banking  and  small  and  medium  enterprise  sectors.  The  Project, \ntherefore, has not included a separate credit line. Instead, it will work on the credit demand side \nthrough its assistance to local farmers and entrepreneurs, and linking them with APB and the \nsupply of credit expected to result from the other initiatives. \n \n2.  Resettlement \n41.  Rehabilitation of 89.5 km of roads and construction of 70.8 km of roads and three \nbridges will require acquisition of approximately 12 ha of land.  Most of the proposed road \nconstruction and rehabilitation will be made within existing rights-of-way, for which there will be \nminimal requirements for land acquisition. Land acquisition will be necessary for new road \nconstruction as well as new primary markets. Selection of alignments for the new road sections \nand primary markets will be done using a community participatory approach during project \nimplementation. The details of number of affected households and type and area of land to be \nacquired from each household will be determined during project implementation, when the \nalignments and the scope of civil works are finalized. However, it is anticipated that there will be \nno dwellings affected, possibly only some small shops that can be relocated nearby, and a \nminimal amount of agricultural land. Because some of the subproject alignments cannot be \ndetermined before appraisal due to design issues and the need for a community participation \nprocess for the new alignments, a sector-like approach is being taken. For this approach, a \nresettlement  framework25  has  been  prepared  to  include  resettlement  objectives,  policy \n                                                 \n24 Established in 1997, the MPDF supports the development of private, domestically owned small and medium \nenterprises  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  MPDF  is  managed  by  the  International  Finance \nCorporation and is financed by a number of countries and institutions including ADB, IFC, Australia, Canada, \nFinland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The MPDF helps private companies \nprepare business plans, raise financing for investment projects, and obtain various types of advisory assistance. It \ndoes not itself finance projects, but rather helps structure financing plans and obtain financing on appropriate \nterms. The MPDF provides advice, and arranges assistance from specialist consultants, for private companies in a \nvariety of areas, such as business planning, marketing strategy, technical and operational assistance, quality \ncontrol and certification, and accounting and management information systems. This assistance is provided either \nin conjunction with the raising of finance for an investment project, or on a stand-alone basis to companies that \nrequire such services. \n25  See Supplementary Appendix D for Resettlement Framework. ", "12 \nframework, and entitlements for different types of losses, and identifying the major institutional \nresponsibilities for land acquisition and resettlement together with the financing sources (see the \nsummary resettlement framework in Appendix 6). In addition, a sample resettlement plan has \nbeen prepared for one project road segment (Songkhone-Thapasoun) for which there is a \nsufficient level of design. It was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Involuntary \nResettlement.26  The  sample  resettlement  plan  is  time-bound  and  costed  and  covers  the \npopulation  record,  socioeconomic  information,  asset  inventory,  land  assessments,  and \nconsultations with and disclosure to the people affected, plus arrangements for rehabilitation, \nmanagement,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  sample  resettlement  plan  will  be  reviewed \nfollowing detailed design if there have been changes in design resulting in changes in land \nacquisition impact. For all other road segments, road alignments will be determined after final \nsurvey and design, during project implementation, and resettlement plans will be prepared for \nADB approval, with satisfactory implementation before the award of any civil works contract. \n \n3.  Environmental Aspects \n42.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) and a summary IEE for the whole project (see Appendix 7), and a sample \nIEE for the road rehabilitation subproject were prepared. The IEE concluded that any adverse \nenvironmental impacts arising from construction and operation of subprojects, in particular, road \nrehabilitation and construction, will be limited in duration and extent, and can be minimized to an \nacceptable level through the implementation of mitigation measures and monitoring programs \nincluded in the subprojects in compliance with the ADB\u2019s environmental requirements and those \napplicable at the national, provincial, and county levels.27  \n \n43.  MAF assured that the mitigation measures identified in the IEEs will be incorporated into \nthe design, construction, and operational stages of the Project. Environmental measures on \nwhich action needs to be taken by the contractors will be incorporated in the contracts for civil \nworks. To ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \nstandards, and ADB environmental requirements will be met during Project implementation, an \nenvironment  unit  comprising  representatives  of  the  Science,  Technology  and  Environment \nAgency (STEA) and MAF will be established within the office of the national project director \n(ONPD) and, at least one environmental staff will be assigned at each of the PPOs. Monitoring \nof mitigation measures will be carried out by ONPD through its environmental unit. Monitoring \nwill be reported to STEA and ADB through quarterly and annual progress reports on project \nimplementation. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n44.  The total cost of the Project over 6 years is estimated at $15.2 million equivalent, \nincluding physical and price contingencies, interest during construction, taxes, and duties. Of \nthe  total  cost,  $6.5  million  or  43%  will  be  incurred  in  foreign  exchange,  and  $8.7  million \nequivalent or 57% will be incurred in local currency. A summary of the cost estimates is in \nTable 1, and detailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 8.28  \n                                                 \n26 See the summary resettlement plan in Supplementary Appendix E. \n27  See Supplementary Appendix F of environmental management plan. \n28  See Supplementary Appendix G for detailed cost tables.

The proposed ADB financing is for a loan of $12.0 million equivalent (78% of total project \ncost), including $5.5 million equivalent of the local currency cost (Table 2). The ADB loan will be \nfrom Special Funds resources with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. The \nannual interest charge will be 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Borrower \nwill be the Government of the Lao PDR.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n    Foreign  Local  Total     \nSource    Exchange  Currency  Cost    Percent \n             \nADB    6.5  5.5  12.0    78% \nGovernment  0.0  3.2  3.2    22% \nTotal    6.5  8.7  15.2    100% \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n46.  The Executing Agency will be MAF, which will appoint the NPD acceptable to ADB. The \nNPD will be assigned adequate office support staff and will have overall administrative and \nmanagement authority over all project components and will be responsible for procurement, \nproject  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  reporting,  arranging  audits,  and  financial ", "14 \nmanagement. A national project steering committee (NPSC) will be established consisting of \nrepresentatives  from  MAF;  MOC;  the  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post,  and \nConstruction; the Committee for Planning and Cooperations; and the provincial vice governors, \nand will be chaired by the vice minister of MAF. The NPD will be the member secretary of the \nNPSC. The NPSC will meet twice a year to review the physical and financial progress of the \nProject. The NPSC will provide overall guidance and direction for project implementation, and \nhelp to resolve any outstanding issues including policy constraints.  \n \n47.  Field implementation will be the responsibility of the respective provincial governments in \nthe project areas. PPOs will be set up and will have day-to-day responsibility for coordination of \nproject  activities  in  the  provinces.  The  governor\u2019s  office  will  designate  a  provincial  project \ncoordinator (preferably from PAFS) acceptable to ADB to head the PPO. A provincial steering \ncommittee will be established in each province, chaired by the vice governor and including \nrepresentatives of PAFS; the department of communication, transport, post, and construction \n(DCTPC); DOC; and the DIH. DCTPC will implement road construction and rehabilitation, and \nprimary market construction; PAFS will implement the extension component; and DOC and DIH \nwill implement the agribusiness promotion component in collaboration with PAFS. The DAFOs \nwill implement the extension component at the district level. DAFO staff will be trained and \nguided by the Central Extension Training Unit at NAFES and by the Provincial Extension \nTraining Units within PAFSs. All will assign full-time staff necessary to implement the Project. \n \n48.  MAF will (i) work through the PAFS and the DAFOs in extension and training of farmers; \n(ii) implement a 3-year capacity-building program for PAFS and DAFO staff; (iii) implement \nproduction and marketing capacity strengthening of DAFOs, WUAs, and FPMGs; (iv) identify \nsites  for  primary  markets;  (v)  work  with  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post  and \nConstruction (MCTPC) to carry out resettlement plans of roads and markets; (vi) work with \nSTEA to carry out environmental impact assessment of roads and markets; and (vii) conduct \nworkshops and study tours within the Lao PDR and to neighboring countries to study a range of \npublic and private sector extension mechanisms. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n49.  The implementation period will be 6 years, from 2003 to 2009. The first year will focus on \nsetting  up  the  necessary  management  systems,  including  procurement,  accounting, \ndisbursement,  and  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  will  lay  the  foundation  for \nimplementation of the Project. A more detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n50.  Goods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will \nbe  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than \n$500,000 equivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is valued from $100,000 to \n$500,000 equivalent. Equipment or materials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be \nprocured  under  direct  purchase.  Final  details  regarding  packages  for  procurement  will  be \ndetermined during project implementation as appropriate.  \n \n51.  The civil works for road rehabilitation to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan \nwill be procured in accordance with local competitive bidding procedures among prequalified \nprivate local contractors acceptable to ADB. Given the small and scattered nature of the roads \nto be constructed/rehabilitated under the Project, individual contracts are unlikely to attract ", "  15 \ninternational bidders. Domestic contractors have the capacity and capability to undertake the \nrequired contracts. The contractors will be prequalified by the DCTPCs. Because labor-based \nmachine-assisted construction technology will be employed, prequalification will be contingent \non the contractors\u2019 attending training workshops on labor-based construction methodology to be \nconducted by ILO specialists. Appendix 10 gives the procurement packages. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n52.  For successful implementation of the Project, consulting services are required for project \nmanagement and a number of technical inputs. The Project will provide about 146 person-\nmonths  of  specialized  service  of  domestic  consultants  and  about  44  person-months  of \ninternational consultants in both long and short-term assignments through a consulting firm \nselected by ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. The amount of consulting services \nidentified under the Project is considered necessary in view of the limited human resources \ncapacity and technical expertise available in the Government at the central, provincial, and \ndistrict levels. Specialist inputs will be required to introduce new technology through the Project \nand will also be used to conduct capacity-building training for PAFS and DAFO staff. Details of \nspecialists required and their terms of reference are in Appendix 11. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  For  consulting \nservices related to labor-based machine-assisted construction technology, a contract may be \nnegotiated directly with ILO, which pioneered this methodology and has extensive experience in \nproviding  assistance  to  similar  projects  throughout  the  GMS  for  several  years.  Similarly, \nservices  related  to  economic  training  will  be  contracted  directly  with  NOSPA  which  has \ndeveloped  special  programs  with  the  assistance  of  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  to  train  government  functionaries  in  market  economics.  ADB \nprocedures for direct recruitment will be followed. The Government\u2019s attention has been called \nto ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud and corruption, as stated in \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n53.  The  Government  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  through  budgetary \nallocation to MAF and the provincial governments, to be applied to finance project expenditures. \nTo  expedite  disbursements,  MOF  will  establish  a  first  generation  imprest  account  with  a \nrecognized commercial bank acceptable to ADB immediately after loan effectiveness. Payments \nwill be made to and from this account for eligible expenditures under the Project. A second \ngeneration imprest account will also be opened by ONPD and each of the provincial finance \ndepartments at a recognized commercial bank in the project provinces acceptable to ADB. \nThese accounts will be used to meet eligible expenditures under the Project incurred by the \nprovincial implementing agencies. Each imprest account will be managed by MOF, ONPD, or \nthe concerned provincial finance department, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001), and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and \nADB. The initial combined total amount in all imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months of \nestimated  expenditure  and  not  more  than  10%  of  the  total  loan.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  will  be  followed  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  imprest \naccounts for payments below the ceiling of $50,000.  \n ", "16 \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n54.  The  provincial  implementing  agencies  will  provide  the  NPD  with  concise  quarterly \nreports during each year of implementation, detailing the physical and financial progress of \nactivities against agreed upon targets and summarizing performance monitoring and evaluation \nresults. In turn, the NPD will submit to MAF consolidated quarterly progress reports and a \ncomprehensive annual progress report, and MAF will forward these reports to the Government \nand ADB. Notwithstanding the quarterly reports, the NPD will report immediately to ADB any \nsignificant events, as they occur, which might affect project implementation. Within 3 months of \nproject completion, a project completion report in the standard ADB format will be prepared by \nthe NPD and submitted to ADB. \n \n55.  The NPD and the provinces will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify the goods and services financed from loan proceeds, the financing resources received, \nexpenditures incurred for the Project and the use of local funds. Accounts will be established \nand maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and following MOF \nguidelines and procedures as amended from time to time. Consolidated project accounts and \nrelated financial statements will be compiled annually by the NPD and audited annually by \nindependent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, audit report, and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the \nfiscal year to which they relate. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n56.  Performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PME)  will  be  undertaken  for  each  project \ncomponent to ensure that project facilities are managed efficiently and benefits realized. The \nNPD, with assistance from the PME specialists, will develop a comprehensive PPMS system. \nThe PPMS system will measure impacts in terms of participation in project activities, changes in \nproduction and marketing, changes in employment opportunities, development of agribusiness, \nand  other  project  impacts.  It  will  include  a  participatory  mechanism  to  include  beneficiary \ninvolvement in monitoring. The NPD, assisted by the PME specialists and the PPOs, will be \nresponsible for carrying out PME activities, including the establishment of benchmarks through \ninitial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys, data collection, and analysis. Consistent \nwith the lessons learned under the Agricultural Program Loans (1989 and 1992), the NPD will \nensure that all constraints to agriculture and agribusiness development caused by weak or \nunsupportive policies are clearly identified at the start of the Project, and closely monitored. The \nNPD will submit, within 6 months of loan effectiveness, a Project Administration Memorandum \ncomprising  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  for  preparing \nbenchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. Annual PME reports will be provided \nto ADB by the NPD throughout project implementation. \n \n8.  Project Review \n57.  During the life of the Project, ADB will carry out annual reviews. Initial reviews will (i) \ndetermine if all proposed implementation arrangements are appropriate and in place; (ii) review \nthe conduct and outcome of capacity-building activities and training programs within the PAFSs \nand DAFOs; (iii) assess progress relating to extension at the village level; (iv) assess progress \nrelating to agribusiness promotion and policy issues; and (v) assess the progress of survey, \ndesign, and construction for the roads component and primary markets. During the third year, \nADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review. The midterm review \nwill  evaluate  the  actual  physical  and  financial  progress  of  the  Project,  implementation ", "  17 \nprocedures,  procurement  performance,  NPD  and  provincial  government  effectiveness,  and \nconsultants\u2019 performance. Before the midterm review, the NPD will prepare a comprehensive \nreport identifying issues for the mission\u2019s consideration. On the basis of the results of the \nmidterm review, necessary changes in project design and implementation arrangements will be \nconsidered by the Government and ADB. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n58.  In conjunction with the Project, TA is proposed to finance activities of an advisory nature. \nThere  is  need  to  ensure  that,  on  completion  of  the  Project,  appropriate  policies  and \narrangements are in place for the functioning of trade and commerce, as well as to ensure \nincreased  demand  for  agricultural  produce  through  the  development  and  promotion  of \nagribusinesses. The objectives of the TA are to (i) identify viable and strategic agribusinesses \nand potential investors and assist them in establishing their businesses; (ii) train potential \ninvestors in market analysis, business plan preparation, feasibility studies, and loan applications \nfrom commercial banks; (iii) train potential investors in agroprocessing in the Mekong Institute or \nother suitable institutes; and (iv) raise awareness of business opportunities by conducting study \ntours  for  potential  local  investors/entrepreneurs  to  businesses  around  the  region.  The  TA \ndescription and terms of reference are in Appendix 12.  \n \n59.  The TA amount of $250,000 will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. Ten person-months of consulting services for agribusiness support and a \ntraining  consultant  will  be  provided,  and  30  agribusiness  investors  will  be  trained.  The \nconsultants under the TA are to be engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB with respect to the use of \ndomestic consultants. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n60.  The project components focus on activities in which the Lao PDR has an underlying \ncomparative advantage and which offer smallholder farmers opportunities for increased food \nsecurity and greater incomes. The Project has an estimated base case economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) of 19.9%. The bulk of project benefits will come from increments of rice, dry \nseason field and vegetable crops, and reductions in vehicle operating costs (the latter comprise \nabout one fifth of the total project benefits). Nonquantified/valued benefits include those from \nlivestock and fisheries demonstrations, greater levels of smallholder technical and business \nskills, greater levels of agribusiness activities and improved social cohesion. The Project is \nrelatively robust (if costs go up 20% the EIRR is 17.0%) and risk-free\u2014the probability of the \nactual EIRR being less than the opportunity cost of capital is low. The estimated financial \ninternal rate of return is some 17.8%. This is lower than the EIRR, as some crop prices remain \nde  facto  affected  by  government  purchasing  policies;  despite  this,  the  proposed  project \ninterventions are financially viable and sufficiently attractive at the farm level to encourage \nsmallholder  participation  (see  Appendix  13).  The  main  risk  to  the  farmer  support  services \ncomponent is lack of accessibility to financial services from APB. \n \n61.  Implementation of the farmer support services and rural infrastructure components faces \nminimal external risks. The technologies chosen for implementation have been tested and \nproven before in the Lao PDR, and it is expected that substantial benefits will accrue with the \nimplementation of these two components. The farmer support services component, however, \nruns  certain  risks  relating  to  accessibility  of  financial  services.  Rural  finance  is  still  in  an \nembryonic stage in the Lao PDR, and is not yet fully understood and supported in a manner that ", "18 \nenables rural financial institutions to operate in a sustainable manner. The ADB TA on Rural \nFinance Development and the proposed Banking Sector Reform Program are expected to \nimprove the enabling environment and support the creation of credit cooperatives. \n \n62.  The  bigger  risk  to  the  Project  is  to  the  agribusiness  and  marketing  development \ncomponent. The Lao PDR is still seen as a risky place to invest. The success of this component \ntherefore  depends  on  improvements  in  the  enabling  environment  for  agribusiness.  This \nincludes, especially, proper implementation at the local level of national policies prohibiting price \nceilings, monopoly protection, and internal trade restrictions, as well as reductions in extralegal \nrent seeking by local officials. Implementation of a supportive enabling environment will be the \nsubject of specific assurances and ongoing loan covenants, and will be monitored in terms of its \nimpact on businesses and entrepreneurs receiving business support services from the Project. \nThe success of this component also depends on the supply of credit increasing due to reforms \npromoted through other projects in the financial sector (e.g., the ADB-financed Rural Finance \nTA and Banking Sector Reform Program Loan). While these risks are real, they will be mitigated \nby TA to identify creditworthy businesses and assisting those businesses to put together good \nbusiness plans and credit applications. They will also be addressed through training of local \nofficials and promotion of policy dialogue between officials and agribusinesses. Moreover, the \nBanking Sector Reform Program Loan will support needed reforms in the area of contract \nenforcement that will also improve the investment environment. \n \n63.  The Project is expected to reduce food insecurity and increase incomes of households \nliving below the poverty line, which constitute approximately 22% of total households in the \nproject area, through provision of appropriate technology, improved livestock production and \nmaintenance practices, and participatory training and extension. Female-headed households, \nwhich constitute 14% of total households in the project area, are expected to benefit from \nimproved access to new technologies, group-based activities including financial training and \nservices, improved market access, and opportunities for self employment. \n \n64.  Resettlements  impacts  will  be  addressed  through  the  Involuntary  Resettlement \nFramework (Appendix 6) detailing the types of expected impacts and the entitlements matrix for \ndifferent  types  of  affected  persons/households,  as  well  as  a  sample  Resettlement  Plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix  H)  prepared  in  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement. All resettlement plans to be subsequently prepared under the Project will be \nsubmitted for prior ADB approval and resettlement impacts will be monitored as part of Project \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n65.  In addition to the standard assurances, ADB will seek from the Government, at loan \nnegotiations, assurances that include but will not necessarily be limited to the following: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  take  all  measures  necessary  to  implement,  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  the  resettlement  plans  developed  for  project  roads  and \nmarkets. The Borrower will be responsible for the acquisition of the land required \nfor the Project and, if required, relocation and resettlement of Project-affected \npeople.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  such  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nrelocation, and resettlement are carried out in accordance with the resettlement \nframework and sample resettlement plan agreed upon between the Borrower and ", "  19 \nthe ADB, the Borrower's procedures, and ADB's requirements as defined in its \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the \nBorrower's procedures and ADB's requirements, ADB's requirements will apply. \nThe Borrower will promptly inform ADB of any such discrepancies. The Borrower \nwill  provide  ADB  with  monthly  status  reports  on  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement process. The Government will ensure that all people affected by the \nProject are compensated and resettled and rehabilitated in accordance with the \nrequirements  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans,  the \nGovernment's  procedures,  and  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement. \nWithout limitation to the overall application of the ADB's Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement, the following principles will apply in respect of compensation and \nresettlement of Project-affected people: \n \n(a)  Project-affected people will be compensated and assisted in such a way \nthat their economic and social future will generally not be unfavorably \naffected by the Project and, in particular, that they will not face a material \nreduction  in  income,  deterioration  of  living  standards,  or  unnecessary \nsocial and cultural dislocation as a result of the Project, \n(b)  Project-affected people will not be required to have formal legal title to the \nland used by them to be eligible for compensation, \n(c)  The amount of compensation in respect of land acquisition will be at a \nlevel sufficient to cover the full replacement cost of the land and the \nstructures built thereon,  \n(d)  All  compensation  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  satisfactorily \ncompleted before ADB will give approval to award the civil works contract. \n \n(ii)  No price ceilings on agricultural commodities or livestock will be imposed in the \nproject areas. \n \n(iii)  No  restrictions  will  be  imposed  on  the  movement  or  sale  of  agricultural \ncommodities, livestock, or related processed products in the project areas other \nthan those that are reasonable for the purposes of disease control and sanitation. \n \n(iv)  The appropriate authorities will provide clear, written information regarding the \nterms and requirements of operating a business to prospective, new, and existing \nagribusinesses that request such information. This information will include, but \nnot necessarily be limited to, tax rates, leasing and other fees, registration and \nlicensing procedures, and conditions and restrictions on reselling the business. \n \n(v)  Labor-based  equipment-assisted  technology  for  rural  road  construction, \nrehabilitation, and maintenance under the Project will be used wherever possible; \nemployment will be voluntary; and workers hired for this work will be paid a fair \nmarket wage. \n \n(vi)  The province and/or the Department of Roads in the MCTPC, as appropriate, will \nprovide adequate funding for routine maintenance of all project roads. \n \n(vii)  APB assures that appropriate loans will be provided to farmers under the Project. \n \n(viii)  The province and the Science and Environment Unit of MCTPC, as well as \nSTEA, assures that all relevant Government and ADB guidelines on environment ", "20 \nmanagement  of  project  intervention  will  be  strictly  followed  during \nimplementation. \n \n(ix)  Prior to survey and design, all project road alignments will be surveyed and (if \nnecessary) cleared of unexploded ordnance according to accepted international \npractice. \n \nB.  Conditions for Award of Contract for Civil Works \n66.  ADB will not approve the award of any civil works contract for any component to be \nfinanced from the loan proceeds for which there is land acquisition, unless the Government has \ncompleted  satisfactorily  and  in  accordance  with  the  approved  resettlement  plan  for  that \ncomponent  compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites,  and  ensured  rehabilitation \nassistance is in place prior to obtaining possession and rights to the required land. \n \nC.  Conditions for Loan Negotiations \n67.  Prior to loan negotiations, an NPD acceptable to ADB will be designated by MAF. \n \nD.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n68.  An adequate number of appropriately qualified full-time staff will be recruited for ONPD. \n \n69.  A  NPSC  chaired  by  the  vice  minister,  MAF,  will  be  established  to  coordinate  the \nimplementation of the Project and the TA.  \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n70.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 9,092,000 to the Lao People's Democratic Republic for the Smallholder \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n \n7 November 2002\n \n ", "    Appendix 1  21 \nAGRICULTURAL SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.

Agriculture employs 85% of the national labor force in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR) and is the largest contributor to the national gross domestic product (GDP) \n(at around 53% of the total in 2001). In 2001, rice contributed 68.4% to the agricultural GDP, \nwhile livestock contributed 27.7% and nonrice crops 3.9%. Industry and services have been \ncontributing an increasing amount to the national GDP in recent years (their contribution was \napproximately 22% and 25%, respectively in 2001). Although agriculture remains the dominant \nsector  of  the  national  economy,  investments  in  the  sector  from  all  sources  (external  and \nGovernment) have averaged less than 19% of the national budget. Agricultural growth was \nabout 4% in 2001, less robust than in previous years. With primary production being largely for \nsubsistence and not being well integrated into a subregional or regional economy, agriculture \nhas been partly insulated from the effects of the regional financial crisis. \n \n2.  The majority of farmers practice subsistence agriculture, and poverty is widespread. \nWhile the national poverty rate is 39%, the rate in rural areas is 43.8%, and the rural poor make \nup 87% of the country\u2019s poor.1 Agricultural productivity remains low at about $199/worker-year. \nThis is compared with $331/worker-year in Viet Nam and $347/worker-year in Thailand.2 The \naverage household income from farming is about $200/hectare (ha). This is compared with \n$357/ha in Thailand and $320/ha in Viet Nam. \n \n3.  Rice is the anchor of the farming system. Rice accounts for over 90% of total crop \nproduction. Nearly 95% of farming households grow rice for their own use. Glutinous rice \naccounts for over 90% of total planted area. Rice yields are low by Asian standards. Figures \nvary by source and across different parts of the country, according to whether irrigation is \navailable or not, and between upland and lowland areas, but overall national average yields are \nwithin the relatively low range of 1.5 to 2.5 tons/ha/crop.3 However, for the wide majority of \nrainfed (i.e., non-irrigated) rice farmers, yields are closer to 2 tons/ha and below.4  Because of \nhigh  postharvest  and  milling  losses  (55\u201360%),  Lao  PDR  needs  to  produce  400  kg  of \npaddy/capita to obtain the 180 kg/capita of milled rice consumed. With a population of 5 million \npeople, it needs to produce 2 million tons annually for rice self-sufficiency. The country has \nexperienced rice deficits consistently until 1998, when it began to achieve a small surplus.5 \nProduction needs to increase by 50,000 tons annually to keep pace with the population growth \nrate of 2.6% per year. \n \n4.  Rice is a subsistence crop when consumed but becomes a cash crop when sold. As a \ncash  crop,  rice  has  consistently  outperformed  several  alternatives.  Ten-year  gross  margin \ntrends (1990\u20132000) show (i) rice at $228\u2013$364/ha; (ii) soybean, $138\u2013$272/ha; and (iii) maize, \n$61\u2013116/ha.6 Farming systems diversification depends on the ability of farming households to \n                                                 \n1  Lao PDR. 1997/98.  Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS 2). \n2  Calculated from LECS2-1997/98 and national census and income data and from statistics provided through \nnational web sites.  \n3  This is compared with 2.5\u20133.5 tons/ha/crop in Thailand and 3.5\u20134.2 tons/ha/crop in Viet Nam. \n4  There are discrepancies between official rice yield data and sampled data from crop cutting surveys and from \ninterviews with farmers.  \n5  Rice production increased from 1.5 million tons in 1989 to 2.3 million tons in 2001. The increase in production is \nattributed to (i) expansion of minor irrigation (40%), and (ii) development and release of improved rice varieties \ndeveloped by International Rice Research Institute/National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute. \n6  Price x yield @ real exchange rate - losses.   ", " 22  Appendix 1 \nmaintain  rice  security.  When  this  is  achieved,  resources  are  released  for  cultivation  of \nnonsubsistence cash crops including commercial rice (both glutinous and specialty), field crops, \nand specialty products such as nontimber forest products. The choice of options depends on \nfarmer availability of market information, physical access to markets, availability of technology \nand inputs, and access to capital and credit facilities.  \n \nB.  Supply Side Constraints \n \n5.  Farming households living along the Mekong floodplains, where most of the country\u2019s \nrice is produced, are vulnerable to natural disasters (flooding and draught), which are occurring \nwith increasing frequency. Household rice security is the number one priority for farmers. In \ngeneral, agricultural production remains characterized by low productivity due to inefficient \npractices  (e.g.,  traditional  and  outdated  cultivation  practices,  inefficient  irrigation  water \nmanagement systems, etc.), inadequate processing technology (especially in the rice milling \nsector), and a lack of timely and adequate inputs supplies. Input use is very low.7 Only 28% of \nhouseholds used chemical fertilizer in 1998/99, only 11% used pesticides in the same period, \nand less than a third used any form of mechanization. Low input use by farmers is attributed to \n(i) limited number of input suppliers;8 (ii) lack of information concerning input use created by the \nabsence  of  viable  extension  mechanisms  (both  public  and  private  sector)  throughout  the \ncountry;9  (iii)  lack  of  adequate  working  capital  among  the  poorest  and  the  smallest  of \nsmallholder producers; and (iv) general lack of access to markets because of physical barriers \ncreated by poor roads, high transport costs,10 and a constrained marketing system wherein a \nlimited number of traders tend to dominate market transactions for produce that moves beyond \nvillage boundaries to the next link in the marketing chain.11 \n \n6.  Nearly one half of households keep buffaloes for draught power, about one third have \ncattle and pigs, and poultry raising is also common.  Although the volume of the informal \nlivestock trade is considerable, widespread animal diseases prohibit more extensive formal \nexports.  The majority of households grow some vegetables for home consumption, and some \nmarket these nonrice crops if located near urban centers. Lack of transport, market access, and \nknowledge  of  markets  are  the  major  constraints  to  boosting  commercial  marketing  by \n                                                 \n7 On average, Lao farmers, using NPK fertilizer, apply 10-20 kilograms (kg)/ha compared with 70\u201380 kg/ha in Viet \nNam and Thailand. Although improved seed varieties have been developed and released, the majority of Lao rice \nfarmers still use traditional varieties. \n8  There are only 57 very small input supply outlets with an average monthly turnover of 500\u20132,000 kg per outlet in \nmonthly fertilizer sales in the entire Mekong corridor area of Lao PDR. 1999. The Government\u2019s Strategic Vision for \nthe Agricultural Sector. MAF. Lao PDR. \n9  Although MAF has some 6,000 employees working at the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Services/District \nAgriculture and Forestry Office level, the extension of productivity-enhancing technology to farmers has not \noccurred, except where individual aid agencies have supported extension in pilot areas at the local level. The major \ncauses of MAF\u2019s heretofore inability to deliver effective extension to farmers are (i) general lack of subject matter \nand extension skills among extension personnel; (ii) lack of logistical support; and (iii) lack of incentive, since \nextension workers only about $15 per month. The private sector has not responded to extension needs because of \nthe limited size of domestic markets, the dearth of agribusinesses, and very limited number of input suppliers \nthroughout the Lao PDR. \n10 Transport costs in Laos average 7.5 baht per ton-km on good roads and 13.1 baht/ton-km on poor roads. In \nThailand, the average transport cost is 3.2 baht/ton-km. \n11 Marketing costs and margins for raw produce trade between the farmgate and retail markets in Vientiane add some \n84% to the cost for urban consumers. This is compared with an average 23% in Thailand. The difference \nrepresents lower Thai transport costs as well as higher Thai market chain efficiency from economies of scale within \na  more  competitive  marketing  environment  with  less  government  regulation  and  interference  in  marketing \nmechanisms. ", "    Appendix 1  23 \nsmallholder households. Overall, nonrice crop production12 and quality remain low even in the \nmost highly productive agricultural areas because of low technical expertise, limited access to \ndomestic and international markets for inputs and outputs, and low domestic demand because \nof  limited  market  size  (the  2002  population  is  some  5.2  million)  and  dearth  of  local \nagribusiness.13 \n \nC.  Agricultural Marketing and Demand Side Constraints \n \n7.  In general, agricultural marketing suffers from a lack of physical access to produce \nmarkets related to poor infrastructure.  Primary market infrastructure is informal and lacks basic \namenities (access, communications, covered areas, cement floors, secure stall spaces). There \nare significant gaps in the marketing chain from producers to retailers. The marketing chain \nsuffers from inadequate competition and is constrained by poor physical access and limited \nproduce supplies. For example, there is an acute shortage of primary market facilities for \nfarmers to trade their produce to retailers and wholesalers. This constraint both causes a \nshortage of wholesalers and traders for agricultural produce (particularly nonrice) and creates \ninefficiency in the marketing system.  \n \n8.  The marketing of agricultural products in Lao PDR tends to be regionally confined, \nresulting  in  significant  variation  in  market  prices  from  region  to  region.    Such  regionally \nunbalanced  markets  are  created  by  (i)  formal  and  informal  regulations  that  prevent  free \nmovement of goods, (ii) prohibitive fees and administrative costs, (iii) poor access roads and an \nunderdeveloped farm-to-market road network, (iv) transportation shortages and high transport \ncosts, (v) small urban demand, and (vi) interregional transport fees and controls in Lao PDR. \n \n9.  There are several channels for marketing of agricultural produce.  The State Enterprises \nfor Food and Crop Promotion (SEFCP), import-export companies, commercial associations, and \nprocessing  factories  buy  rice,  meat,  and  other  food  commodities  from  local  markets  or \nmiddlemen.  For  purchase  of  rice,  middlemen  usually  visit  and  buy  directly  from  individual \nhouseholds during the harvesting period. For nonrice produce, farmers usually must do their \nown marketing. There are 448 wholesale and retail produce markets in the Lao PDR. Of these, \n13 are privately owned and managed, 101 are Government-leased and privately managed, 73 \nare managed by provincial and district administrations and the remaining 261 are village and \ncommunity  managed.14  No  markets  handling  fresh  food  have  cooling  facilities  or  display \ncabinets. Fresh foods are displayed on tables with little regard for sanitation or quality grading. \nIn  general,  market  areas  are  small  and  limited,  and  buyers  accept  ungraded  and \nundifferentiated produce. \n \n10.  Agricultural  rice  marketing  remains  dominated  by  the  public  sector.  SEFCP  has  a \ncommanding share of the market for paddy (70%), with the remaining 30% share in the hands \nof private entrepreneurs.15 \n \n                                                 \n12 For Lao PDR, as a whole, the diversification ratio (DR) is 0.21. The DR is defined as the nonrice cropped area/total \ncropped area for all crops. For Thailand, in spite of its role as a major international rice producer, the DR is 0.59. \nLao maize yields are about 1 ton/ha, compared with 5\u20136 tons in Thailand. \n13 Lao maize yields are about 1 ton/ha,  compared with 5\u20136 tons in Thailand. Soybean yields in Lao PDR are some \n2\u20133 times lower than in Thailand and Viet Nam. \n14  Source: Ministry of Commerce. \n15 5% of Lao PDR\u2019s total production of 2.3 million tons is marketed rather than consumed by smallholder producing \nhouseholds. ", " 24  Appendix 1 \n11.  There is no established market information system. The sole market information sources \nare  SEFCP  and  private  traders.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  has  a  market \ninformation collection system, but the output appears in annual statistical reports that do not \nreach farmers or traders. There are critical needs for improved market access in rural areas, for \nstrengthening of marketing chains, and for lifting of regulations and barriers to free competitive \nmarket competition. \n \n12.  Over half of the villages nationwide are more than 10 kilometers (km) from the nearest \nmarket, and more than 35% are more than 6 km from a dry season access road and more than \n15 km from an all weather road.16 Compared with neighboring countries, the Lao PDR has a \nsmall  population,  which  partly  explains  the  lower  level  of  marketing  activity.  Large-scale \nwholesale trade in agricultural commodities is the exception. Most products are sold directly by \nfarmers, or by small traders (collectors) to the market retailers in the towns. Transport is by \nhand-tractor and trailers, small three-wheeled vehicles and pick-up trucks.   \n \n13.  Potential international agribusiness investors perceive the Lao PDR to be a high-risk \ncountry in which to conduct business. There are high transaction costs for registrations and \nother administrative processes, and the weak and sometimes contradictory, and often opaque \nlegal framework imposes extra burdens in this regard. Further, nontariff barriers and other \nborder irregularities predominate, and potential investors flag the poor raw material supply \nresponse of farmers as an additional constraint to agribusiness viability.    \n  \n14.  The  main  constraints  to  local  agribusiness  investments  include  lack  of  business \nexpertise and understanding of markets, lack of liquidity and access to credit, the limited size of \nthe private sector, and the long payback period for agribusiness investments (usually 5 years or \nmore). \n \nD.  Strategic Opportunities and Challenges  \n \n15.  Immediately adjacent to the Lao PDR borders live at least 200 million Thais, Chinese, \nand Vietnamese. As industrial development accelerates in these three countries, paddy and \nagricultural land resources are shifting to the non-agriculture sectors. There is a corresponding \ndecline  in  domestic  food  production  amid  their  growing  populations.  As  a  result,  these \npopulations could become significant consumers of rice, livestock, vegetables, and other farm \nproduce from the Lao PDR and other neighboring countries. \n \n16.  Since its move towards a market economy, a number of private investors (both local and \nforeign) have established agroprocessing units within the country. This has created demand in \nthe areas near the processing plants. With the development of urban areas, the domestic \nmarket for diversified agricultural output has grown. There is additional purchasing interest from \nforeign buyers, notably from Thailand, but also from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet \nNam. Coffee, peanut, soybean, mungbean, corn, livestock, fisheries, nontimber forest products, \ncotton, fruits, and vegetables are products in demand. Some farmers are already responding to \nthese market opportunities \n \n17.  To stimulate growth in agriculture and raise rural incomes, there is an opportunity to \nmove beyond subsistence farming to more diversified, commercial agricultural production. With \ntwo of it\u2019s neighbors, Viet Nam and Thailand, being dominant low-cost rice producers in the \n                                                 \n16  LECS 2, 1997/98.

Government Policies and Strategies \n \n18.  The Government is committed to a market-based economy with equitable distribution of \nthe  benefits  of  growth.  In  November  1999,  with  ADB  assistance  under  TA  2883-LAO: \nAgriculture Strategy Study,17 the Government presented its strategic vision for the agriculture \nsector at a conference of aid agencies. The strategy focused on (i) increasing rural income by \ndeveloping market-oriented agriculture, and changing public institutions and policies to better \nserve this aim; (ii) recognizing the preeminent role of the private sector and working to improve \nthe business and investment environment; (iii) achieving a better balance in investments in the \nsector;18 (iv) addressing the respective opportunities and constraints of the country\u2019s upland and \nlowland farming systems and communities; (v) improving environmental management of the \ncounty\u2019s natural resources; and (vi) improving and sustaining investments made in supporting \ninfrastructure (primarily irrigation and rural roads). The agriculture strategy study demonstrated \nthat for a range of crops (including rice, maize, groundnut, cotton, sugarcane, and coffee) the \ncountry\u2019s  production  is  competitive  in  the  region  and,  with  the  application  of  improved \ntechnology, it could be among the world\u2019s low-cost producers of several commodities. The \nGovernment  has  affirmed  its  commitment  to  trade  liberalization.19  In  this  context,  the \nGovernment views assistance with the promotion of market-oriented, diversified agriculture (and \nits own Commodity Development Program) as key to improving smallholder livelihood and \nexpanding the nation\u2019s economy. \n \n19.  To improve rural livelihoods through increased production of higher value crops, the \nGovernment seeks to (i) strengthen its adaptive research and extension services; (ii) facilitate \nthe development of private sector trade and agroprocessing; (iii) improve farmers\u2019 access to \nmarket information and supporting infrastructure; and (iv) increase the availability of credit for \nfarmers, traders, and processors. In essence, the Government views commodity production as \nbeing market driven, with the initiatives coming from the private sector. The Government views \nits role as a facilitator to assist and advise smallholder farmers and to encourage their linkages \nto markets, traders, and processors. \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 1997.

Agriculture is mainly subsistence oriented, \nand remains characterized by low productivity due to inefficient practices, lack of access to appropriate extension and \ntraining services, inadequate technology, lack of access to inputs, lack of access to institutional financing, as well as \naccess to markets. Rice is the major crop produced, and yields are low by Asian standards. It is grown mainly for food \nsecurity. Poor households are characterized by high levels of dependency and low labor productivity, and suffer from \nfood insecurity. Female-headed households often fall into this category.  Improved productivity of rice through \nimproved wet season rice production can contribute significantly towards reducing food insecurity for poor households, \nand help to free up land for growing marketable crops such as vegetables, maize, and soybean. There is a ready \nmarket for such produce in neighboring countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. The development of the productive \npotential of poor smallholders through improved appropriate technologies; training and extension services; training \nand facilitation of poor farmers, women, and ethnic minorities for improved access to financial services; improved \naccess to markets through improved communications; and development of linkages with potential agribusiness \noperations can help to increase food security, increase employment opportunities, and raise agricultural incomes \nthrough market-oriented production and access to better markets and prices. \n \nB.

", " 34  Appendix 6 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n1.  Introduction.  A  resettlement  framework  for  this  Project  was  prepared  to  meet  the \nrequirements of a sector-like approach. This framework is based on ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice and will be applied to \nall subproject roads and markets where there will be land acquisition and resettlement. This \nframework presents the specific policies and guidelines to guide the process for land acquisition \nand resettlement. A sample resettlement plan (RP) was prepared for Songkhone-Thapasoun \nroad. For each of the remaining subproject roads and markets, an RP will be prepared by the \ndepartment  of  communication,  transport,  post  and  construction-provincial  project  office \n(DCTPC-PPO),  together  with  the  local  administrative  authorities  and  compensation  and \nresettlement committees during project implementation.   \n \n2.  Scope  and  Scale  of  Resettlement.  The  rural  access  road  component  comprises \n(i) rehabilitation of a total of 89.5 kilometers (km) of roads, (ii) construction of a total of 80.8 km \nof roads, and (iii) construction of three bridges (196 meters).  Most of the proposed road \nconstruction and rehabilitation will be made within existing rights-of-way, for which no significant \nresettlement will be required. In some portions of roads, however, civil works would require an \nestimated 125,000 square meters (m2) of land acquisition (both homestead and agricultural \nland).  No relocation of people is expected, however, there may be some market kiosks affected.  \nWith the exception of the Songkhone-Thapasoun road, for which an RP was prepared before \nappraisal, the details of numbers of affected households and type and area of land to be \nacquired  from  each  household  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  when \nalignment and scope of civil works are finalized. Construction of 15 market centers with a total \ncovered (roofed) area of 22,400 m2 (126,000 m2 total \u201copen\u201d or fenced area) is also planned \nunder this infrastructure component. These market centers consist of nine small-sized market \ncenters and six medium-sized market centers. The scope of land acquisition is not known to \ndate.  \n \n3.  Resettlement Policy. The resettlement policy framework for the Project has been built \nupon the laws of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  draft \nnational resettlement policy.1 This Project will be bound by the principles and conditions stated \nin the resettlement framework that will be approved by the ADB and the provincial government. \nIf there are any discrepancies between ADB and government policy, ADB policy will supersede. \nThe principles and objectives are to ensure that all affected people (APs) will be compensated \nfor their losses at replacement cost and provided with rehabilitation measures in order to assist \nthem to improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living standards and income earning \ncapacity. \n \n4.  Project Affected People. The APs include the following persons to be identified during \ncensus for each of the subprojects roads and markets where there is land, property, asset \nacquisition, or resettlement involved: \n \n(i)  persons whose agricultural, residential, or commercial land is in part or in total \naffected (temporarily or permanently) by the Project, \n                                                 \n1  A draft national resettlement policy was prepared by the Lao PDR Government in 1995 and presented by the \nScience,  Technology  and  Environment  Agency  to  the  ADB  RETA  5935  Regional  Workshop  on  National \nResettlement Policy Enhancement and Capacity Building at ADB Headquarters in 2002.  The draft policy is the \nbasis for a ministerial decree on resettlement that is being prepared under the Environment and Social Program \nLoan 1867-LAO, approved on 6 December 2001. ", "    Appendix 6  35\n(ii)  persons  whose  houses  and  other  structures  are  in  part  or  in  total  affected \n(temporarily or permanently) by the Project, \n(iii)  persons whose businesses or source of income are in part or in total affected \n(temporarily or permanently) by the Project, \n(iv)  persons  whose  crops  (annual  and  perennial)  and  trees  are  affected  by  the \nProject, and  \n(v)  persons  whose  other  assets  are  in  part  or  in  total  affected  (temporarily  or \npermanently) by the Project. \n \n5.  Principles and Objectives. The following principles and objectives will be applied: \n \n(i)  Acquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  and  resettlement  of  people  will  be \nminimized as much as possible. \n(ii)  The census or inventory of losses to be carried out as part of the resettlement \nplanning process for the infrastructure subprojects will represent the cut-off date \nfor eligibility.  Eligible persons are entitled to be provided with compensation and \nrehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least maintain \ntheir preproject living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels.   \n(iii)  Lack  of  formal  legal  rights  to  the  assets  lost  will  not  prevent  APs  from \ncompensation and rehabilitation measures. \n(iv)  Plans for land acquisition and other assets, provision of replacement land, and \nrehabilitation measures will be carried out in consultation with the APs to ensure \nminimal disturbance. \n(v)  Compensation rates for physical assets (land, house/building/other structures) \nand nonphysical assets (lost income from productive assets or jobs) will be \ncalculated  at  replacement  cost  or  current  market  value  at  the  time  of \ncompensation. \n(vi)  APs that stand to lose only part of their physical assets will not be left with a \nproportion that will be inadequate to sustain their current standard of living, such \nminimum size being identified and agreed upon during the resettlement planning \nprocess. \n(vii)  Affected populations will be systematically informed and consulted about the \nProject,  the  rights  and  options  available  to  them,  and  proposed  mitigating \nmeasures, and to the extent possible be involved in the decisions that are made \nconcerning their resettlement.  \n(viii)  The  consultative  process  will  include  not  only  those  affected,  but  also \nrepresentatives of the local governments of the areas in which the Project is \nlocated, host communities' community leaders, civil society, organizations such \nas nongovernment organizations, and members of local people\u2019s organizations.   \n(ix)  Existing cultural and religious practices will be respected and, to maximum extent \npractical, preserved. \n(x)  Special measures will be incorporated in the resettlement plan to protect socially \nand  economically  vulnerable  groups  such  as  the  ethnic  minorities,  women-\nheaded households, children, and elderly people without support structures, and \npeople living in extreme poverty. \n(xi)  The previous level of community services and resources will be improved after \nresettlement. \n(xii)  There will be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nthe preparation and implementation of the RP. ", " 36  Appendix 6 \n(xiii)  The compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation activities will be satisfactorily \ncompleted before a no-objection from ADB will be provided for award of contract \nof civil works under each subcomponent.  \n(xiv)  The Executing Agency will see to it that institutional arrangements are in place to \nensure effective and timely design, planning, consultation, and implementation of \nthe land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \n(xv)  Where  a  host  community  is  affected  by  the  resettlement  of  others  into  that \ncommunity, the host community will be involved in any resettlement planning and \ndecision-making. All attempts will be made to minimize the adverse impacts of \nresettlement upon host communities. \n(xvi)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available to cover \nthe  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  within  the  agreed  upon \nimplementation period. Owing to practices established under current government \nprocedures, clear budget commitments are required for critical activities such as \nformal detailed physical surveys and administrative functions associated with \ncompensation and resettlement. \n(xvii)  Appropriate reporting (including auditing and redress functions), monitoring, and \nevaluation  mechanisms,  will  be  identified  and  set  in  place  as  part  of  the \nresettlement management system.  \n(xviii)  Construction activities will not commence until the required lands have been fully \nacquired  and  populations  appropriately  compensated  and  relocated  in \naccordance with the principles set out above. \n \n6.  Entitlement  Matrix.    The  Project  entitlements  have  been  designed  to  provide \ncompensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  for  lost  assets  and  restore  or  enhance  the \nlivelihoods of all categories of affected people.

People\u2019s Participation.  The APs will participate throughout the various stages of the \nplanning and implementation of the RPs. The APs will be fully informed by the relevant agencies \nrelated to entitlements, compensation, and rehabilitation options and grievance mechanisms \nunder the RPs. This can be in a form of a project information booklet written in a language that \ncan be easily understood by the APs and issued to APs before Project appraisal.  \n \n8.  Implementation Arrangements.  MCTPC, through the Environment and Social Division \nof the Department of Roads, will oversee the RP activities of the concerned PPO and provide \ntechnical assistance if necessary. The DCTPC-PPO will be responsible for all components of \nthe subprojects including the RP.  Full-time resettlement officers at the provincial and district \nlevels will be designated and will be responsible for all resettlement-related activities. The \nDCTPC-PPO  will  submit  all  subproject  RPs  to  ADB.  A  compensation  and  resettlement \ncommittee will be formed at various administrative levels to seek inputs from stakeholders in the \ndecision-making and implementation of the resettlement framework. The affected persons and \nminority groups will also be represented in those committees and be included in the grievance \nresolutions concerning compensation and other resettlement benefits.  \n \n9.  Implementation Schedule. The RP for each subproject will be prepared following the \ncompletion of detailed design for that subproject. Satisfactory payment of compensation and \nprovision of other rehabilitation entitlements and relocation if that be the case, will be completed \nbefore a no-objection from ADB can be provided for award of civil works contract under each \nsubproject. \n ", "    Appendix 6  39\n10.  Complaints and Grievances. In terms of grievance redressals, the APs will be made \nfully aware of their rights to grievance and the procedures both verbally and in writing during \nconsultation, survey, and time of compensation. The APs may present their complaints to the \nconcerned local administrative officials and compensation and resettlement committees.  The \ncomplaint can be filed first at the village level and can then be elevated to the highest or \nprovincial level if the APs are not satisfied with the decisions made by the village and district \nlevels/committees. APs will be exempted from all taxes and administrative and legal fees. \n \n11.  Supervision, Monitoring, and Evaluation. The DCTPC-PPOs in collaboration with the \nlocal administrative authorities and compensation and resettlement committees, are responsible \nfor internal monitoring of RP implementation. The resettlement specialist and consultants under \nthe loan will monitor resettlement implementation periodically. Once the land acquisition and \nresettlement  programs  have  been  completed,  the  DCTPC-PPOs  will  carry  out  a \npostresettlement  impact  evaluation  to  assess  whether  impacts  of  the  Project  have  been \nmitigated adequately and the preproject standard of living of APs has been restored as a result \nof resettlement and project activities.  \n \n12.  Cost and Budget.  The RP will include the breakdown for each type of losses with \ncorresponding cost estimates reflecting replacement cost or current market values.  The cost \nestimates will make adequate provision for contingencies. The RP will also include the detailed \nschedule and procedures related to flow of RP funds. \n \n13.  Disclosure. In accordance with ADB policy, the APs will be fully informed and closely \nconsulted on resettlement and compensation options. The subproject implementing agencies \nwill translate into Lao the resettlement framework and subproject RPs, especially the sections \non (i) policies, and (ii) entitlements of all categories of AP. These documents in Lao will be \nplaced at important public places in the villages, where copies can be obtained for independent \nreview and study. Project information booklets will also be prepared and distributed to all APs. \nOther means of disclosure can also be through radio and public meetings. Their comments, and \nmodifications based on them, as relevant, will be incorporated in the resettlement framework \nand updated RPs. \n \n14.  The project resettlement framework and subproject RPs will also be disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Smallholder Development Project in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR) is aimed at strengthening the rural economy by promoting market-oriented, diversified \nagricultural  production  on  smallholder  farms  and  by  improving  market  links.  However, \ndiversifying agricultural production involves various types of interventions with potential impacts \non the environment. Therefore, the Project has been classified by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) as an environment category \u201cB\u201d project. An initial environmental examination (IEE) and a \nsummary initial environmental examination (SIEE) for the whole project as well as a sample IEE \nfor a road subproject were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements for environmental \nassessment.  \n \n2.  The objective of the IEE is to identify impacts, evaluate their severity, recommend \nmitigation measures, and propose a monitoring plan for use in project implementation. Project \ncomponents  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  involve  institutional  adjustments,  farm  service \nextension work such as training, and various types of physical infrastructure. The IEE covers a \nwide scope of potential environmental impacts associated with these interventions. Many of \nthese impacts occur on the Project in only a minor degree. For instance, the IEE provides \nguidance  related  to  rangeland  management,  because  it  is  assumed  that  with  intensified \nextension activity some additional livestock rearing will occur; however the loan project will not \nfinance improved pasture for livestock grazing, which is expected to be undertaken at the \nhousehold level. The type of impacts generally associated with large livestock operations are \nunlikely to occur.   \n \n3.  The SIEE follows guidelines provided in Environmental Assessment Requirements of the \nAsian Development Bank, the Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agriculture and Natural \nResources  Development  Projects,  and  the  Handbook  for  Incorporation  of  Integrated  Pest \nManagement in Agriculture Projects. Host country guidelines taken into account include the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Law;  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Regulations  of  the \nScience,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency,  and  the  \u201cEnvironmental  Guidelines  for \nReducing  the  Environmental  Effects  of  Road  Projects  in  Lao  PDR\u201d  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunication, Transport, Post, and Construction (MCTPC), which was issued officially by \nPrime Minister\u2019s Decree No: 05/PM dated 14/1/95.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n4.  The  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  commercial  smallholder  agriculture  and \nassociated agribusiness, with the overall objectives of achieving sustained increases in rural \nincomes  and  long-term  reductions  in  rural  poverty.  Specific  objectives  are  to  (i)  achieve \nincreased production and marketing of diversified, nonrice dry season cash crops, livestock, and \nfisheries; (ii) improve smallholder access to domestic and international markets and market \ninformation; and (iii) increase investment in value-adding agribusiness.  \n5.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  farmer  support \nservices to improve farmers\u2019 technical knowledge of integrated farming systems, and access to \nmarket  information  and  inputs,  (ii)  agribusiness  and  marketing  to  stimulate  investment  in \nagribusinesses, (iii) rural infrastructure, and (iv) project management. The total cost of the \nProject over 6 years is estimated at $15.2 million equivalent, including physical and price \n   ", "    Appendix 7  41 \ncontingencies, interest during construction, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, $6.5 million or \n43% is foreign exchange cost and $8.7 million equivalent or 57% is local currency.  \n \n6.  The Project covers 16 districts in four provinces of the Lao PDR. These include six \ndistricts in Savannakhet, six in Champassak, two in Khammouane, and two in Vientiane. These \nprovinces currently have the highest potential for commercial agricultural development where \nfactor and product markets are beginning to function and complementary infrastructure such as \nirrigation, roads, electricity, and some agribusiness development is beginning to emerge. As \nwell, they present the most interest to potential foreign investors.  \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n7.  The Project is generally centered in lowland or mid-range areas at varying elevation from \nlows of around 100 meters (m) along the Mekong River in Southern Champassak and Marketing \nLines of Communication (MLOC) areas in Savannakhet, increasing to around 200 m in the mid-\nrange Bachieng District in Champassak and Xonbuli in Savannakhet, up to a high elevation of \n1,200 m for upland reaches around Pakxong situated on the Bolovens Plateau in Champassak. \nThe two districts in Vientiane Province range in elevation from 180 to 210 m.  \n \n8.  Climate  represents  a  significant  factor  in  agricultural  production,  determining,  for \ninstance, the productivity of coffee in the Bolovens, or seasonal paddy in the MLOC zones. \nClimate is not a determinant in degree of environmental impact on the present project. Rainfall \nvaries considerably throughout the country and is heaviest (more than 2,600 millimeters) in the \nupland areas of the Bolovens in the south and the highlands of Borikhamxai and Khammouan. \nLowland areas in Savannakhet and Khammouan are the driest, experiencing rainfall around \n1,400 mm annually.   \n \n9.  Ecological resources and species diversity are generally high in all parts of the country, \nespecially where natural environments prevail and human development is still at a low level.  \nForest cover is about 42% nationwide (1999), with the highest level of forest cover in the \nsouthern part of the country, inclusive of Savannakhet (about 59% of total land area). Forest \ncover is somewhat sparse in the three districts in Vientiane Province, and land use shows a \nmixture of forested areas (mixed deciduous and dry dipterocarp), bamboo and ray forested \nareas, scrub, and wet rice cultivation on land under agricultural use.    \n10.  The project areas in Savannakhet Province contain some degraded dry dipterocarp \nforest, with about 15% in scrub. Lowland areas near the Mekong are dominated by wet rice \ncultivation. Paddy dominates throughout the areas where roadways are being constructed. \nProject areas in Khammouan Province are low in elevation and dominated by paddy production \nand dry dipterocarp forest. The project area in Champassak along the river has a predominance \nof land in agricultural use under wet rice cultivation, with dry dipterocarp forest and some scrub \nand grassland. The cropped area in the districts on the right (west) bank of the river is upwards \nof 28% of the total land area. \n11.  National biodiversity conservation areas (NBCAs) make up about 14% of the total land \narea of the country in 20 separate NBCAs, with another 276 conservation or protection forests \n(International Conservation Union [IUCN], 1999). Wetlands are numerous in the vicinity of the \nProject. Lowland environments throughout the Lao PDR are subject to flooding during the wet \nseason because of their flat slopes, and contain a variety of plant and animal species.  \n \n   ", "42  Appendix 7 \n12.  Population  growth  is  high  throughout  the  country.  The  natural  reproduction  rate \nnationally is 2.6%, with the highest in Savannakhet and Champassak at 2.78\u20133.32%, and lower \nin Vientiane Province at 2.01\u20132.22%. A rate of natural reproduction intermediate between these \nrates prevails in Khammouan Province. Typical lifestyles of lowland culture consist of wet rice \nagriculture in bunded fields watered by rainfall and overflow from rivers. Roads are generally \ngood in Vientiane Province, but poorly developed along the right (west) bank of the Mekong \nbelow Pakse, where much of the rural population resides. \nD.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n1.  Farming Support \n \n13.  The Project will introduce new intensification technologies to smallholders to intensify the \nproduction  of  wet  season  rice,  nonrice  cash  crops  during  the  dry  season,  livestock,  and \nfisheries. The method used will be participatory selection and adoption of techniques that \nenable  farmers  to  make  sound  resource  management  decisions,  taking  into  account  the \ncontinuously changing environment of an open market economy. This approach is a farmer \ndemand-driven participatory process, which will form the basis of the national extension system \nof the National Agricultural and Forestry Extension Service (NAFES), now under development. \n14.  Fertilizer use in the Lao PDR has been historically low, but there is evidence it is \nincreasing.  The  application  of  appropriate  technology  through  the  agriculture  extension \nagencies can mitigate against excessive fertilizer use. Given the history of low use rates and \nextension advice, Lao PDR farmers are not likely to excessively apply fertilizer. Streams are not \nsusceptible to eutrophication except during the low flow season, when fertilizer loss could occur \nfrom irrigated fields supporting dry season rice crops. Farmer support by the extension agencies \ninvolves routine analyses of soil samples for soil pH, nitrate, phosphorous, and potassium. The \nextension agencies should provide training in production and use of organic fertilizer and soil \nnatural conditioning agents to supplement chemical fertilizer use, such as compost from urban, \nperiurban, and agricultural wastes.   \n \n15.  Three types of livestock production is envisioned by provincial officials in the project \nareas,  with  increases  in  each  type  by  about  20%  over  the  next  5  years:  (i)  upland  or \nmountainous area grazing within production forests where some ground fodder propagates, \ninvolving cattle, buffaloes, and goats; (ii) lowland foraging among dry deciduous forest that has \nbeen  partially  converted  to  improved  pasture,  again  for  cattle,  buffaloes  and  goats;  and \n(iii) animal propagation near towns aiming at small livestock (pigs, chickens, ducks and goats). \nLivestock can have a wide range of effects on rangeland ecosystems that can be both positive \nand negative, and grazing impacts can be seen at the species, community, and landscape \nlevels.  Therefore,  the  technology  transfer  component  of  the  proposed  Project  needs  to \nincorporate a program for monitoring effects of livestock on various ecosystem types within the \nproject area with the aim of minimizing detrimental impacts while supporting good management \npractice.  \n \n16.  After rice, livestock and fisheries are the most important ingredients of the Lao farm \nincome. A knowledge base for rural aquaculture is needed to define the range of appropriate \ntechnologies and their social and economic profiles. This is the approach proposed in the \nProject. The proposed Project calls for a limited number of pilot projects within each regional \nnetwork to be set up at the local administrative and agro-ecological/ecological levels. These \npilot studies should be viewed as public policy experiments. The development of aquaculture \n   ", "    Appendix 7  43 \nhas  to  eventually  become  integrated  into  the  national  governance  structure  for  it  to  be \nsustainable.  Environmental  impacts  can  be  monitored  alongside  other  project  parameters. \nThese concern water quality primarily, and are generally associated with large commercial \nfacilities  during  the  time  of  drawdown  and  harvesting.  The  pond  culture  demonstrations \nproposed in the Project are unlikely to have adverse impacts on the environment. \n2.  Agribusiness and Marketing Development \n \n17.  The  Project  will  provide  (i)  agribusiness  investment  promotion  through  conferences \norganized by the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industries; (ii) provincial trade fairs \nand investment promotion workshops to promote collaboration between producers and value-\nadded industries in Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam; (iii) establishment of a Lao agribusiness \nforum for private business and policy makers to discuss legal, regulatory, and other relevant \nissues; (iv) upgrading of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry\u2019s (MAF) information system in \ncoordination with the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) and others to ensure mutual benefit and to \navoid duplication; and (v) assistance to the MOC\u2019s Trade Promotion Center to promote Lao \nproducts through electronic media.  \n \n18.  Cleaner production (CP) is an approach for pollution control that emphasizes reduction \nof pollutants at the point of generation using general means for good housekeeping and in some \nsettings specialized types of equipment that minimize pollutant release. Currently, the Ministry \nof  Industry  and  Handicrafts  is  undergoing  a  revision  of  its  rules  for  industrial  waste,  and \nextensive training of staff in CP as well as monitoring and enforcement methods. Therefore, it is \nproposed that the project activities under this component may include the topics on how to \npromote CP in agribusiness investment in Lao.  \n \n  3.  Rural Infrastructure Development \n \n19.  The Project will provide for the rehabilitation of 89.5 kilometers (km) and construction of \n70 km of strategic roads, identified as the highest priority rural access roads in the project area. \nThese  roads  are  (i)  the  Pakse-Champassak-Soukhouma-Mounlapamok  road  (Road  14-A), \nwhich links the impoverished but potentially productive lower Mekong plain of Champassak \nProvince to the highly commercial east-west corridor of Paksong-Pakse and the Thai border; (ii) \nthe Champhone-Xonbuli road in Savannakhet Province, which links the potentially productive \nXonbuli District to the commercially active east-west corridor in Savannakhet, which connects to \nthe border region with Thailand; and (iii) the Songkhone-Thapasoun road, which links the \ncommercial center of Songkhone District in Savannakhet Province to a key Mekong River \nborder trading market with Thailand. \n \n20.  In Savannakhet, the roadway from Songkhone to Thapasoun (Section B) does not pass \nthrough wetlands. The area is dominated by paddy likely to be subject to seasonal flooding. \nSection A from Muang Champhone to Muang Xonbuli crosses a wetlands area, which causes \nthe roadway to be impassable during the wet season. The Xe Champhone wetlands, an area of \nsome 240 square kilometers, is oriented north - south and covers a distance of some 35 km. \nRoadway width will need to be widened about 3\u20134 m in order to obtain side slopes allowing the \nroadway to be raised some 1\u20132 m. Therefore, the impact of the Project on the wetlands will be \ninsignificant.  \n21.  In Champassak Province, Roadway Section C from Champassak to Soukhouma will be \nrehabilitated. This passes through the area identified as the Soukhouma Wetlands Group; \nhowever, the land near the roadway is currently in paddy production, and there are no wetland \n   ", "44  Appendix 7 \necosystems that will be affected by improvement in the roadway.  Further south, Roadway \nSection  D  from  Soukhouma  to  Mounlapamok  also  passes  through  an  area  identified  as \nwetlands.  Marshes  are  interspersed  through  the  area,  and  can  be  readily  avoided  in  the \nconstruction of the roadway. The impact on wetlands from the construction of the roadways in \nChampassak will be insignificant as long as reasonable controls are in place. \n \n22.  Construction of the roadways, and to a lesser extent the ferry landing and markets, will \nrequire movement of materials and equipment, the import of labor, and disruption of usual paths \nof travel. Land clearing can cause unnecessary impact. The contractor should clear only areas \nneeded for widening the roadways and should maintain erosion and silt control in place at the \ntoes of slopes and along drainage channels at all times, decommissioning in the wet season \nwhen soil loss is potentially greatest. To minimize the impact on forests, the contractor should \nalso minimize forest clearing, prevent trade in nontimber forest products (including wildlife) by \nworkers  engaged  in  construction,  prevent  use  of  firewood  by  workers,  and  reforest  in \ncompensation for trees lost due to clearing for the roadway and borrow areas. \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n23.  MAF will be the Executing Agency for the Project. Project implementation will be in the \nhands  of  the  Office  of  the  National  Project  Director  (ONPD)  located  within  NAFES.  The \nrespective  provincial  governments  in  the  project  areas  will  be  the  implementing  agencies. \nProvincial project offices (PPOs) will have day-to-day responsibility for coordination of project \nactivities in the provinces.   \n \n24.  To ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \nstandards, as well as ADB\u2019s environmental requirements, will be met during the implementation \nand operation of the proposed Project, in particular the further preparation of an IEE for each \ncandidate  investment  subproject,  an  environmental  unit  for  the  whole  project  should  be \nestablished within the ONPD. In the meantime, at least one environment staff should be hired at \neach PPO. Considering the lack of environmental management capacity within MAF and the \nprovinces, it is proposed  that  an international environmental assessment specialist for about \n1\u20132  person-months  and  a  domestic  environmental  specialist  for  about  2\u20133  person-months \nshould  be  recruited  under  the  Project  in  the  first  year  of  project  implementation.  The \nenvironmental staffs within ONPD and the PPOs will work together with the international and \ndomestic environmental experts to develop the IEE/Environmental Impact Assessment where \nnecessary, monitor the implementation of mitigation measures identified by IEEs, and maintain \nregular contact with each subproject.   \n \n25.  Environmental  monitoring  of  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  is  recommended \nthroughout  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  Most  monitoring  is  associated  with  the \nconstruction of roadways, for which monitoring protocols are described in some detail in the \nMCTPC environmental assessment guidelines. Monitoring can be undertaken in most cases \nduring  the  inspection  for  the  roadway  construction  work,  which  is  a  responsibility  most \ncommonly shared among various individuals, including the technical assistance consultant, the \nONPD representative and the provincial officials from various agencies (MCTPC and NAFES, \nspecifically).  In  the  meantime,  the  environmental  monitoring  results  will  be  complied  and \nincorporated into the quarterly and annual reports of the Project.   \n \n   ", "    Appendix 7  45 \nF.  Findings and Conclusions   \n \n26.  The project components include the construction of roadways on existing alignments, \nconstruction  of  markets  at  new  locations  and  construction  of  four  ferry  ramps  at  existing \nlocations.  The  conclusion  is  that  significant  environmental  impacts  on  the  Smallholder \nDevelopment Project are limited in duration and extent, and can be mitigated through the \nimplementation of proposed mitigation measures in using of existing guidelines, technological \ncontrols, and regulatory mechanisms already in use within the country. Therefore, a detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment for the Project or further special studies is not warranted. \nG.  Recommendations \n \n27.  The overall recommendation of the IEE is that environmental concerns should not inhibit \nproject  implementation  for  the  Smallholder  Development  Project,  rather  that  the  proposed \nmitigation measures should be incorporated into the body of the proposal for the Project and \nimplementation should proceed. Many concerns are procedural and relate to the construction of \nthe rural infrastructure component.

Justification \n \n1.  The private sector in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is very small and \nin a nascent stage of development. In addition, the Lao PDR is viewed as a very risky place to \ninvest. The majority of the limited number of investors in the country invest in projects with \nshort-term  capital  recovery  (such  as  hotels,  timber  extraction  and  wood  processing,  and \ntextiles). The expected capital recovery in most cases does not exceed 18-24 months. Under \nnormal conditions, agribusinesses require a minimum of 5 years for investment recovery.  \n \n2.  The  critical  component  of  agricultural  demand-side  strengthening  is  agribusiness \ndevelopment. Achieving this objective depends on mobilizing agribusiness investments in the \nproject area. Strengthening marketing chains between farmers and domestic agribusinesses \ndepends on strengthening the skills and capacity of agroenterprises and promoting the entry of \nnew value-adding agribusinesses into the sector. The agribusiness sector in the Lao PDR is \npresently very thin and burdened by major constraints.  \n \n3.  The present operations of agribusinesses are constrained by a variety of factors: (i) \nacute shortage of both investment capital and working capital; (ii) acute shortage of technical \nskills; (iii) insufficient raw material supply; (iv) heavy dependence on imported processing raw \nmaterials and managerial expertise; (v) lack of production, trade, management, and marketing \nexperience;  (vi)  very  limited  understanding  of  existing  markets;  (vii)  low  local  demand  for \ndiversified food commodities; (viii) absence of local processing facilities capable of absorbing \nlarge  quantities  of  produce;  (ix)  low  levels    of  production  and  management  technology; \n(x) limited  number  of  agricultural  commodity  traders;  (xi)  very  weak  commercial  networks \nthroughout  the  country;  (xii)  risk  imposed  by  the  uncertain  legal  environment;  and \n(xiii) difficulties with contract enforcement. \n \n4.  There are only 582 registered businesses in Lao PDR. Thirty percent of these are micro \nscale agroprocessing cottage industries at the household and village levels employing 2 or 3 \npersons.  In  addition  to  micro  cottage  industries,  there  are  15  small-  to  medium-scale \nagribusinesses employing 50-300 persons. Eighty percent of these are located in Vientiane \nMunicipality, just beyond the project area. \n \n5.  The  Project  Preparatory  Technical  Assistance  consultant  (for  the  smallholder \ndevelopment project) identified eight categories of suitable agribusinesses for development in \nthe  project  area.  Development  of  these  enterprises  would  have  a  significant  agricultural \ndemand-side  pull  on  local  agricultural  production.  These  include  feed  mill/piggery/poultry \ncomplexes; canneries; cold storage, grading, sorting, and bulk marketing facilities; seed oil mills; \nsugar mills; fish hatcheries; small-scale rice mills; and postharvest handling facilities at the \nvillage level. The consultant also identified and interviewed 15 potential agribusiness investors \nwho expressed interest in the agroprocessing sector. Although expressing strong interest in \nsetting up agribusinesses, all of the persons contacted face most of the constraints listed above. \nThe major constraint, in addition to low human resource capacity, is lack of capital. \n \n6.  The  potential  agribusiness  investors  contacted  also  lacked  business  management \nexperience and even the necessary skills required in the particular industry. They lacked the \nability to prepare business plans and credit proposals. All have requested technical assistance \n(TA) for overcoming deficiencies in these critical areas. The Project will target the development \nand expansion of 30 agribusinesses through the project area over the 6-year implementation \n ", "    Appendix 12  61\nperiod. This TA will provide training and assistance to 30 candidate businesses to mitigate the \nidentified constraints to agribusiness development. The TA will play a proactive role in helping \nclient  investors  secure  financial  backing  from  Lao  commercial  banks,  Thai  agribusiness \ninvestors, and the Mekong Enterprise Fund (MEF). Where possible the TA will work closely with \nthe Mekong Project Development Fund (MPDF). The TA will complement the Agribusiness and \nMarketing Development component of the loan Project (which it accompanies). \n \nB.  Scope \n \n7.  The TA will facilitate agribusiness development by working with the Office of the National \nProject  Director  (ONPD)  to  provide  training  and  development  support  to  agribusiness \ncandidates within the four Project provinces. To obtain a good cross-section of entrepreneurs, \ntraining and support services provided by the TA will be advertised at national agribusiness \nconferences, cross-border trade fairs, and the Lao Chamber of Commerce and Industries. The \nTA is expected to be completed in 24 months. \n \n8.  Potential agribusiness investors supported by the TA will include enterprising business \npeople with imaginative entrepreneurial ideas and strong interest in receiving assistance. As \nevidence of interest, candidates will be expected to make contributions in kind such as providing \nlocal  transportation  and  assistance  for  subsequent  marketing  and  other  survey  work. \nAgribusinesses supported by the TA will develop \u201cniche\u201d markets for Lao products with clear \ncomparative advantage where unique products have the potential to generate above-normal \nreturns and import substitutes (e.g., organic produce, nontimber forest products, animal feed).  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  provide  assistance,  varying  from  $10,000  to  $30,000,  to  small-scale \nagribusinesses operated totally by the private sector. Agribusinesses supported by the TA will \nreceive training in business plan and feasibility study preparation, marketing studies as well as \napplying for credit financing. The final stage of the agribusiness development and training \nprocess supplied by the TA will consist of guiding and mentoring client candidates through \nbusiness plan and feasibility study preparation, marketing studies and loan applications, and \nfollow-up with the banking sector.1 Training aids developed by the MPDF will be used for the \ntraining program. \n \n10.  This TA will also provide funding for agribusiness management and process training at \nthe Mekong Institute/Khon Kaen University in Thailand and sponsor study tours to selected Thai \nagribusinesses as an adjunct to the formal training program.  \n \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The project components promote diversification and commercialization of agricultural \nproducts that the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has an underlying comparative \nadvantage, so that smallholder farmers can increase food security and cash income. The \neconomic analysis was undertaken on the Project as a whole covering all four components \nbecause the crop production benefits are to arise from these Project investments as a mutually \nsupporting and integrated package. Associated and linked investments in roads, provision of \nproduction supports, and wider support for agribusinesses are all essential for smallholders to \nincrease production and earn cash income through improved access to factors/inputs as well as \nfunctioning output markets. The financial analysis, on the other hand, focused only on the \nviability of representative farm models under the Project. Crop budgets and farm models were \ndeveloped to determine incremental farm incomes. \n \nB.  Assumptions Used for Farm Models \n \n2.  The Project is expected to increase productivity through better farming practices, and to \nfacilitate farmers\u2019 commercial production and diversification. The calculation of financial and \neconomic benefits was based on per hectare crop budgets for wet season rice, dry season rice, \ncorn, peanut, soybean, cabbage, and garlic. The farm models assume that households apply \nthe extended technology only on a proportion of their planted area first, but that this proportion \nrises to a natural plateau of three quarters of targeted households\u2019 wet season planted area and \nto 60% of the total area for dry season cultivation by Year 7. \n \n3.  Wet Season Production. Average wet season rice yields should increase from 1.5 tons \nper hectare (ha) to 2.3 tons/ha, and wet season rice output is assumed to be 5% better in \nquality (mainly due to earlier harvesting) on average under the with-Project situation. The \nProject will cover 54 villages in each of 16 districts (a total of 864 villages), and the extension \ncomponent is expected to impact some 20% of the total households within a district with wet \nseason  cultivation  technology  changes.  Assuming  that  roughly  half  of  villagers  actively \nparticipate in the extension component, about 40% of participating households in those targeted \nvillages should be adopting the wet season technology by Year 7 (Table A13.1).  \n \n4.  Dry  Season  Production.  Overall  average  dry  season  (irrigated)  rice  yields  should \nincrease from 3 tons/ha to 3.2 tons/ha with the Project. There will be a cropping shift towards \ncombinations  of  nonrice  crops  in  the  dry  season,  which  will  become  broadly  increasingly \nvaluable (i.e., in moving from diversification mix 1 through diversification mix 2 to diversification \nmix 3) over time.1 The extension component expects to impact 60\u201375% of the households in \neach  district  that  undertake  dry  season  cultivation. As  only  between  12%  and  16%  of  all \nhouseholds in the project provinces undertake dry season cultivation, this is equivalent to an \nimpact on about 10% of all households in the project area. This target is technically realistic, as \nall the villages with current access to dry season cultivation will be selected to participate in the \nproject extension efforts. The estimate of impacted dry season areas assumes new irrigation \nscheme development with an annual average growth rate of 5% over the Year 1\u20137 period.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Diversification mix 1 = paddy (50%) and peanut (50%); diversification mix 2  = paddy (50%), maize (25%), and \nsoybean (25%); and diversification mix 3 = paddy (33%), cabbage (33%), and garlic (33%). ", "64  Appendix 13 \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n5.  Financial Viability of Representative Farms. A financial analysis was undertaken to \nestimate the effects of project investments on the income of beneficiary farmers by comparing \nwith-  and  without-Project  scenarios.  In  line  with  the  prevailing  size  of  irrigated  land  per \nhousehold, crop budgets and farm models were prepared to determine incremental farm income \nas a result of the project investments. The incremental revenues were valued using financial \nfarm gate prices. The costs included full operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, water fees, \nand the cost of rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation. The results of the financial analysis \nindicate that each representative farm is financially viable (Table A13.2). Farm-level returns to \nproject investments are highly positive; each farm model in the four provinces is expected to \ngenerate a return of around 50-70% increase over the without-Project situation. As the farm \nincome analysis assumes the costs of O&M of irrigation schemes, postharvest activities, and \ntransportation to be covered by farmers, the analysis shows that the beneficiary farmers should \nbe able to afford such levies and the proposed farm models will be financially sustainable. \n \n6.  Government Budgetary Implication. The Project will have relatively minor budgetary \nimplications  consisting  of  (i)  incremental  operating  costs  of  the  extension  system,  and  (ii) \nincremental maintenance costs of the project roads. The aggregate incremental costs of the \nproposed extension system account for less than 0.01% of the Government\u2019s annual budget \n(operating  and  capital  costs)  for  the  agriculture  sector,  and  less  than  0.2%  of  the  annual \nallocation for 1999\u20132001. Incremental operating costs for extension services in the project \nprovinces  during  project  implementation  will  be  financed  by  the  loan  funds.  As  for  the \nmaintenance cost of the project roads, which is estimated to be about $60,000 per year, \nmaintenance of national road sections will be financed out of the Road Maintenance Fund, \nwhich  provides  5\u2013to-1  matching  fund  for  any  locally  generated  revenues.  While  provincial \ngovernments are responsible for maintenance of rural access roads, the provinces and/or the \nDepartment of Roads in the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post, and Construction has \nalso assured the provision of adequate funding for routine maintenance of all project roads.  \n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n \n7.  The economic viability of the Project was analyzed comparing the estimated benefits \nunder the without-Project and with-Project situations for the 20-year life of the Project. In the \ncase of the without-Project situation, there is no expected deterioration or decline of yields and \nareas planted/harvested in the absence of the proposed Project investment, and therefore \nwithout-Project and current situations are de facto the same thing. The economic analysis is \npresented in 2002 constant terms, and economic costs and benefits are estimated using the \ndomestic numeraire.  \n \n8.  Investment and recurrent costs were segregated into tradable, nontraded, and labor \ncomponents, and converted into economic price using financial process net of taxes, duties, and \nsubsidies. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 is used to value tradable resources converted \nat the prevailing/official exchange rate of KN9,470 (July 2002) to the US dollar for the economic \nanalysis.  As regards specific conversion factors, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.9 is used for \nrural labor in the farm budgets, reflecting average prevailing levels of rural unemployment and \nunderemployment throughout the Lao PDR. \n \n9.  The Project\u2019s estimated direct benefits comprise (i) crop production benefits that stem \nfrom  yield  increments  and  price  impacts  covering  an  area  of  about  30,000  ha  (9,000  ha \nirrigated), and (ii) reduced vehicle operating costs (VOC) for non-agricultural traffic on the ", "      Appendix 13  65 \nproject roads.  The calculation of VOC saving assumed that one third of traffic is entirely non-\nagricultural in nature, based on historical trends, and no benefits were estimated for time \nsavings. Benefits generated by the livestock and fisheries extension activities were not included \nin the analysis, because no directly identifiable benefits are apparent from the project outputs. \n \n10.  The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is estimated to be \n19.9% (net present value = KN80,100 million, discounted at 12%). This quite positive estimate \nessentially arises from the scale of the latent economic opportunity, indicating that the Project \nwill help transform an underlying comparative advantage into realized competitive performance. \nJust over half the cropping benefits arise from wet season rice cultivation and the remainder \nfrom dry season interventions. About one fifth of total project economic benefits come from VOC \nsavings. \n \n11.   The project beneficiaries comprise farmers, farm workers, and their families whose \nlivelihood  depend  on  about  106,700  ha  of  land,  and  agroprocessors,  and  commercial \nagricultural traders. The total number of direct wet season beneficiary households is about \n33,000  and  dry  season  direct  beneficiary  households  are  some  16,000.  Many  of  these \nbeneficiaries are poor farm workers and small subsistence farmers, who would benefit from \nincreased  income  through  improved  production  of  wet  season  rice.  In  addition  to  these, \nadditional individuals and households will benefit from the road improvements (including labor \nemployed  to  build  roads\u2014up  to  500  full-time  jobs  created),  livestock  and  fisheries \ndemonstrations, and the various agribusiness support interventions. Total project beneficiaries \nwill likely be at least 45,000 households. The distribution analysis of project benefits suggested \nthat smallholders are the primary beneficiaries of the Project, followed by road users. The \nProject is also expected to have a modest but positive impact on poverty-reduction in the long \nterm: The poverty impact ratio of the Project is estimated to be 25%, which compares with the \nnational poverty incidence of 39.2%. \n \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n12.  A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of higher project costs, lower \nproject benefits, lower production improvements, and a delay in project implementation. The \nProject\u2019s returns are relatively robust; increasing the costs by 20% causing the base case EIRR \nto fall to 17%, and cropping benefits have to fall 42% for the EIRR to fall below 12% (Table \nA14.3). Switching values for major variables indicate that overall costs have to rise by 72% for \nthe Project to become nonviable. Rice yields/prices and adoption rates would have to fall by half \nfor the same outcome. The omission of VOC benefits entirely does not affect Project viability. \nQuantitative risk-based analyses suggest that the probability of the Project achieving less than \nacceptable economic is very low at about 6%. \n \nF.  Component Viability Analysis \n \n13.  Although the Project design logic is based on the fact that several linked interventions \nare required for both on-farm and off-farm activities to deliver the expected benefits, it can also \nbe useful to look at the economic viability of the major components separately. For the extension \ncomponent, if all its directly attributable costs are compared with the cropping benefits from the \nProject, the \u201ccomponent\u201d EIRR is 37%. For the rural infrastructure component the estimated \neconomic return is 34%. \n ", "66  Appendix 13 \nG.  Domestic Resource Cost Analysis \n \n14.  Production  of  major  field  crops  supported  by  the  Project  has  strong  comparative \nadvantage  in  the  Lao  PDR,  indicating  the  potential  for  export.  The  cross-county  cost  of \nproduction information in Table A13.4 supports this conclusion, suggesting that the fundamental \neconomic viability of the Project intervening to increase technical efficiency in the production of \nsuch crops is sound. \n \nTable A13. 1: Incremental Production \n \n      Without  With Project \n    Item  Project  Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  Year 6  Year 7-20\nI.
