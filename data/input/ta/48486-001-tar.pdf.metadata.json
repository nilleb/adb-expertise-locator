INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Palau Public Utilities Corporation (PPUC) is mandated by the Government of Palau \nto  deliver  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  throughout  Palau.  PPUC  is  currently \nimplementing several major water supply and sanitation improvement projects, which have \nhighlighted its limited capacity for strategic oversight of the sector and weak technical capacity \nin planning, delivering, and managing water and wastewater services. To solve this urgent \nproblem, the government has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to improve water and sanitation sector management.1 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. The TA complements other ADB assistance to PPUC through TA \nfor Strengthening Public Sector Management in the North Pacific, and the Koror\u2013Airai Sanitation \nProject (KASP).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sector reform. In 2010, the government began a program to reform Palau\u2019s water and \nsanitation sector, which would also help overcome public and environmental health issues, as \nwell as constraints on tourism development, Palau\u2019s major economic driver. Palau has made \nsubstantial progress in the reform program and in addressing the drivers for the reforms. Before, \nPalau\u2019s water and sanitation sector was characterized by (i) an inadequate legal and regulatory \nframework; (ii) low water tariffs and high water consumption; (iii) fragmented responsibilities for \nmanaging  and  delivering  sector  services;  (iv)  inefficient  operations  and  management; \n(v) insecure water supply systems, prompting projections of water shortage in Koror because of \nexcessive demand growth and high system losses; and (vi) frequent uncontrolled overflows \nfrom the dilapidated Koror sewer system, and unsuitable soils in Arai for on-site wastewater \ntreatment and disposal. These problems are causing environmental and public health issues \nwith serious impacts on the economy. The limited capacity of the Koror sewer network also \ndiscourages investments in tourism, particularly proposed hotels in Malakal, because Palau\u2019s \nEnvironmental Quality Protection Board requires all new hotel developments in Koror to treat \nwastewater on site until Koror\u2019s sewerage system is rehabilitated and expanded. \n \n3.  The legal and regulatory frameworks to create an independent and autonomous water \nand sewerage authority operating on commercial principles and targeting full cost recovery have \nbeen established. Following the adoption of the Water and Sewer Corporation Act of 2010, the \nPalau Water and Sewer Corporation (PWSC) was established in September 2011 and started \noperations in August 2012. In June 2013, PWSC and PPUC were consolidated under the \nUtilities Consolidation Act (Republic of Palau Public Law No. 9-4, 2013) to form an independent \nand  autonomous  electricity,  water,  and  sewerage  corporation  and  thereby  improve  cost \nefficiencies  in  the  delivery  of  such  services.  Within  PPUC,  the  Water  and  Wastewater \nOperations Division (WWOD) was established to deliver public water and sanitation services. \nPPUC is governed by a board of directors comprising seven members who are appointed by the \nPresident of Palau, with the advice and consent of the Palau Senate. \n \n                                                \n1  The  target  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  activities,  and  implementation  arrangements  were  agreed  during \nconsultations with the Government of Palau and PPUC in August 2015 and are recorded in a memorandum of \nunderstanding dated 14 August 2014. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website \non 26 October 2015. \n2  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Public Sector Management in the North Pacific. Manila; ADB. \n2011. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the Republic of \nPalau: Koror\u2013Airai Sanitation Project. Manila. \n ", "2   \n4.  A new water and sewerage tariff structure was introduced on 7 February 2011. Water \nand sewerage tariffs have been incrementally increased each year, and PPUC is on track to \nfully  recover  the  costs  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  operations  and  maintenance,  debt \nservicing, and depreciation by fiscal year 2017. \n \n5.  Sector  investments.  Palau  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious  investment  program to \nreplace inadequate sanitation infrastructure and to improve the security and reliability of Palau\u2019s \nwater supply systems, particularly those in Koror and Airai. ADB approved loans for KASP in the \namount of $28.8 million equivalent on 19 November 2013, targeting improved environmental \nand public health in Koror and Airai through better delivery of sanitation services by PPUC. \nKASP will implement high-priority components of the Koror\u2013Airai Sanitation Master Plan, such \nas (i) rehabilitation of the sewerage network in Koror, (ii) provision of new sewage treatment \nfacilities in Koror and Airai, and (iii) construction of a sewer network to service Kesabelau in \nAirai. On 28 May 2015, the Japan International Cooperation Agency signed a grant agreement \nwith the Government of Palau in the amount of up to \u00a51.843 billion ($15.3 million equivalent) for \nthe Koror\u2013Airai Water Supply Improvement Project (KAWIP), which will improve the water \ntransmission mains, reform water distribution zones, and replace water distribution pipelines in \nKoror and Airai. \n \n6.  Water and wastewater service capacity of Palau Public Utilities Corporation. Until \nthe consolidation of the PWSC into PPUC in 2013, PPUC\u2019s core business was the supply of \nelectricity.  PPUC\u2019s  technical  capacity  to  deliver  electricity  services  is  well  established  and \nresourced,  enabling  it  to  provide  reliable,  accessible,  and  affordable  electricity  to  most  of \nPalau\u2019s population. However, PPUC\u2019s capacity to deliver reliable and sustainable water and \nwastewater  services  is  limited.  WWOD\u2019s  qualified  technical  staff  comprises  two  expatriate \nengineers, a graduate engineer who leads WWOD\u2019s capital works program, and several water \nand  wastewater  treatment  plant  operators.  Given  the  large  water  supply  and  wastewater \ninvestments, the technical capacity of WWOD urgently needs to be strengthened. Although ADB \nis providing short-term capacity-building assistance to PPUC through the provision of a water \nand wastewater advisor,3 such advisory services are required for a substantially longer period to \nenable effective and sustained knowledge transfer. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be improved water supply and sanitation services in Palau through the \ndelivery of robust and well-planned infrastructure, and is aligned with Palau\u2019s Medium-Term \nDevelopment Strategy, 2009\u20132014 and the Palau\u2019s Management Action Plan goal to \u201ccontinue \nto upgrade and develop Palau\u2019s infrastructure to act as a catalyst for strong private sector \ngrowth  and  foreign  direct  investment.\u201d 4  The  TA  outcome  will  be  improved  operational \nperformance of PPUC\u2019s water supply and sewerage systems. \n \n                                                \n3  The water and wastewater advisor has been recruited to provide urgently required technical guidance to PPUC for \na period of 3 months from October 2015 under the Technical Assistance for Sector and Thematic Assessment for \nPolicy Development.

The TA will strengthen PPUC\u2019s capacity to (i) plan, deliver, manage, and operate the \nupgraded water supply and sewerage services; and (ii) provide strategic oversight on both \nspecific and general sector issues through the provision of a highly experienced water and \nwastewater advisor who will provide on-the-job training and mentoring over a period of 24 \nmonths. 5 The  advisor  will  help  strengthen  PPUC\u2019s  water  and  wastewater  operations  with \nstrategic  oversight,  guidance,  and  quality  assurance  for  (i)  the  KASP  and  KAWIP  project \nsteering committees, and (ii) PPUC\u2019s project management unit. At the strategic level, the water \nand  wastewater  advisor  will  provide  policy  and  planning  advice  on  the  development  and \noperation of Palau\u2019s public water supplies and wastewater systems. At the operational level, the \nsame advisor will provide technical advice for the sustainable operation and maintenance of \nPPUC\u2019s water supply and wastewater systems and provide technical oversight and quality \nreview (on behalf of the government and PPUC) of PPUC\u2019s investment projects. The draft terms \nof reference for the water and wastewater advisor are in Appendix 3.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, furniture, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  The TA executing and implementing agency will be the Ministry of Finance. An individual \ninternational  consultant  (the  water  and  wastewater  advisor)  will  be  engaged  to  provide \n22.5 person-months of inputs over a period of 24 months from March 2016, and will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time). The government has requested that the water and wastewater advisor report to the \nMinister of Finance to enable close oversight by the Ministry of Finance of PPUC\u2019s water and \nwastewater operations until PPUC\u2019s delivery of water and wastewater services improves. It is \nanticipated  to  progressively  improve  as  PPUC\u2019s  current  water  supply  and  wastewater \ninvestments are commissioned. The water and wastewater advisor will, however, work on a \ndaily basis with (i) the PPUC chief executive officer, (ii) the PPUC Water and Sanitation Project \nManagement Unit, and (iii) the PPUC water operations manager. TA funds shall be disbursed in \nline with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n11.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Palau for Water and Sanitation Sector Management, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                \n5  Although PPUC is a state-owned enterprise, it is unusual for companies to be TA beneficiaries, and ADB\u2019s Office of \nAnticorruption and Integrity assisted with integrity due diligence of PPUC. The Office of Anticorruption and Integrity \nconcluded that the potential integrity and reputational risk arising from ADB\u2019s association with PPUC and its related \nentities is low. \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nThe impact of the TA will be improved water supply and sanitation services in Palau through the delivery \nof  robust  and  well-planned  infrastructure,  and  is  aligned  with  Palau\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nStrategy, 2009\u20132014 and the Management Action Plan goal to \u201ccontinue to upgrade and develop Palau\u2019s \ninfrastructure to act as a catalyst for a strong private sector growth and foreign direct investment.\u201da \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \n \nImproved operational  a.
