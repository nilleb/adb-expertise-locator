In April 2007, the Government of Palau requested advisory technical assistance (TA)1 \nfrom ADB to assist in the development of a viable health insurance scheme. Underlying Palau\u2019s \nrequest was concern about the sustainability of health care financing and limited cost recovery of \nhospital operations. ADB considered the request to be consistent with the country strategy and \nprogram update for Palau (2007\u20132009),2  which identified policy advice and technical assistance to \ncreate a more sustainable economy as the basic thrust of ADB\u2019s medium-term assistance to the \ncountry. Support for effective financing of basic social services is also a key result area of the \nPacific Strategy (2005\u20132009).3 \n2.   Scoping  on  major  health  financing  issues  in  Palau  and  the  nature  of  the  technical \nassistance  required  was  undertaken  in  October  2007.  An  aide  memoire  to  the  Government \ncontaining an initial contextual analysis is available upon request. A TA Fact-Finding Mission was \nfielded in January 2008 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, \nscope, costs, financing, and implementation arrangements and the consultants' outline terms of \nreference. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   Health care delivery in Palau is satisfactory and health indicators are relatively high. This \ncan be attributed to government prioritization of health and high government health spending (over \n$700 per capita), supported by a steady flow of United States (US) funding under the Compact of \nFree Association. However, this level of spending is increasingly unsustainable because of rising \ncost pressures, high hospital account receivables (about $10 million in 2006), and government \nrevenue constraints. In particular, a significant tightening of public financing is possible following \nthe review of the financial terms of the Compact of Free Association by the US in 2009, which \nwould  lead  to  major  cuts  in  the  overall  government  budget.  Government  policy  makers  are \ntherefore  keen  to  improve  the  sustainability  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position.  The  heavily \nsubsidized health sector (which accounted for about 16% of total fiscal expenditures in 2006) is a \nkey area of concern. \n \n4.  To improve the long-term sustainability of health care financing, the Government has tried \nto  improve  cost  recovery  and  collection  of  fees.  User  fees  for  hospital  services  have  been \nincreased according to a progressive \u201csliding-fee schedule\u201d and upfront payments for the 55% \ncost-share for official off-island medical referrals (primarily to the Philippines) have been required. \nHowever, these measures seem to have affected utilization patterns, with some patients forgoing \nmedical care because of large out-of-pocket costs for health-care services. Although informal \ncommunity social safety nets exist in the form of large family networks, required upfront payments \nfor overseas treatment are reportedly driving families of some patients into poverty. Only a small \npercentage of citizens are currently covered by private medical insurance, usually as part of \ncompany  schemes;  the  premium  rates  for  private  insurance  are  generally  regarded  as  too \nexpensive  for  private  individuals,  who  rely  on  the  public  health  system  instead.  Access  to \naffordable health care for the large population of foreign migrant workers is also a critical concern, \nsince the health of these populations directly affects that of local communities, particularly with \nregard to communicable diseases.4\nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n1 m Tehme bTeAr sfi,r sBt oaapprde aorfe dD iirne AcDtoBrs B, uMsianneassg eOmppeonrtt,u onirt iessta offn,  3a1n dJ amnuaayr yb e20 p0r8e.l iminary in nature.  \n2  ADB. 2006. Palau Country Strategy and Program Update. Manila.  \n3  ADB. 2004. Responding to the Priorities of the Poor: A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n4  About 51% of Palauans (15 years and over) work full time. It is estimated that about 25%\u201330% of Palau\u2019s residents \nare non-Palauan \u201cguest\u201d workers. The guest workers primarily occupy low-paying, unskilled, or semiskilled positions in \nthe private sector while Palauans occupy public sector jobs and white collar jobs in the private sector. \n ", "2   \n5.   The  health  sector  needs  to  be  systematically  reviewed5  to  identify  more  appropriate \nrevenue-raising mechanisms, particularly prepayment and risk-pooling (insurance), with a view to \nensuring coverage, equity, and affordable access to health services for all residents, including \nmigrant workers. Increasing cost pressures on health care from Palau's aging population and the \ntrend toward a higher prevalence of noncommunicable diseases will increase the need to explore \noptions for cost control and more efficient allocation of resources within the sector. A systematic \nreview must be supported by good data that reflect a comprehensive picture of total health \nspending and resources at the national level (e.g., a national health account). However, current \ninformation tends to be fragmented and is often driven by the reporting requirements of specific \nUS federal grant programs. Government information is available only on its own appropriations \nand expenditures. \n \n6.   Palau has been working on a national health insurance scheme since 1995. In January \n2008, Congress passed the National Healthcare Coverage and Savings Act. The Act requires \nestablishment of (i) a national health savings plan (NHSP) in the first phase, and (ii) a national \ngroup health insurance plan in the second phase. The NHSP is considered a concrete step \ntowards later development of a national group health insurance plan. The NHSP is to be financed \nby individual medical savings accounts (MSAs) with contributions from employers and employees, \nas well as possible funding from external loans and grants. The Social Security Administration will \nbe responsible for the administration and investment of this fund. The legislation was drafted with \ninputs from a diverse group of key stakeholders, although lack of data and actuarial expertise \ninhibited a detailed assessment of the financial implications. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.   The impact of the TA will be that public expenditure on healthcare services is financially \nsustainable.  The  expected  outcome  is  that  government  legislation  on  National  Healthcare \nCoverage and Savings Act is operational. At the output level, (i) policymakers are better informed \non evidence to steer implementation of approved legislation on National Health Savings Plan, and \n(ii) evidence-based and locally-appropriate sustainable health financing plan is developed for \npolicy consideration. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.   The TA will be carried out in two phases to support steering and implementation of the \nrecently approved legislation to establish (i) the NHSP, and (ii) the national group health insurance \nplan under the National Healthcare Coverage and Savings Act. Under phase I, the TA will conduct a \ndetailed assessment and actuarial projections on the financial viability of the NHSP and make \nrecommendations to improve its scope and fiscal sustainability. The development of a first national \nhealth  account  (NHA)  for  Palau  will  be  explored  during  this  phase,  which  will  provide \ncomprehensive information on national health sector resources and expenditures. The NHA will \ngreatly facilitate analytical work under the TA and future monitoring and informed decision-making \non health financing by the Government. However, developing the NHA will depend on the level of \nexisting data and the resources required for further data collection. \n \n9.   The assessment of the NHSP under phase I will evaluate its sustainability and its longterm \n                                                 \n5  Palau\u2019s government health delivery system consists of an 80-bed hospital located in the capital Koror, four primary \ncare super-dispensaries, and four community-based dispensaries in the outlying islands. There are three private \nprimary care clinics (two in Koror and one free clinic in Airai run by the US Navy). ", "  3\npotential to provide equity, coverage, and financial protection. It will examine (i) costs, (ii) short- \nand  medium-term  fiscal  pressures,  (iii)  the  revenue-raising  potential  of  NHSP  and  MSAs  to \nimprove cost recovery of health services, (iv) the long-term role of the NHSP and its alignment \nwith the eventual development of a national group health insurance plan as envisaged in the act, \nand (v) the potential effects of the NHSP on utilization patterns of health services and current \ninformal community \u201crisk-pooling\u201d arrangements. The assessment will test different scenarios to \ninform stakeholders on how the NHSP can be fiscally sustainable and how Palau's other health \nfinancing objectives can be met. \n \n10.   Implementation of phase I will involve close consultations with a working group of in-\ncountry stakeholders and experts, especially on (i) the outline of the assessment and key policy \nquestions to be answered on the NHSP and the National Healthcare Coverage and Savings Act, \nand (ii) data interpretation and recommendations to ensure their usefulness and local relevance. \nExperts from the Singapore Central Provident Fund\u2014which is the model for the NHSP in Palau\u2014\nwill be asked to participate in some consultation meetings. The minister of health will nominate \nparticipants in the working group. \n \n11.   Phase II will build on the findings of phase I. It will model a sustainable health financing \nplan that is appropriate to Palau's economic, cultural, demographic, and epidemiological context. It \nwill review the governance, institutional, and long-term needs of the health sector to understand \nPalau's health financing opportunities and challenges with a view to arriving at practical solutions. \nThe scheme will aim to attain fiscal sustainability (i.e., a balance in health spending and available \nrevenue) in the context of Palau's objectives on population health care. On revenue mobilization, \nphase 1 will offer options on different financing sources (including from MSAs) and will focus on \neffective risk-pooling mechanisms and a variety of arrangements that will enable affordable health \ninsurance for all citizens, as well as for the large population of foreign migrants. It will explore cost \npressures and cost inefficiencies in the current system of health services delivery and suggest \nmeasures to improve cost control and cost effectiveness. Assessments of institutional capacity \nand other investment requirements for administration of the selected health financing scheme will \nbe undertaken toward the end of this phase. \n \n12.   To ensure ownership and harnessing of local knowledge, phase II will be implemented \nwith the assistance of a working group of local stakeholders and experts, nominated by the \nminister of health. The experience of health insurance plans in other countries in the region, \nincluding the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Philippines \nwill be taken into account. Experts from these countries may be invited to participate in sessions of \nthe working group. \n \n13.  Palau has twice received external technical assistance to develop a health insurance plan \n(in 1995 and 1999).6  However, this technical assistance was criticized as being independently \ndesigned  and  overly  complex  and  prescriptive,  and  for  having  limited  relevance.  This  TA  is \ndesigned to incorporate lessons from these experiences, ensure ownership, and tailor outputs to \nthe country\u2019s needs and circumstances. Its key features are that it will (i) build on an existing legal \nframework; (ii) involve stakeholders at key stages of analysis, interpretation, and formulation; (iii) \nconduct  comprehensive  analytical  work  that  reflects  broader  issues  affecting  health  sector \nfinancing in Palau and include long-term sustainability analysis; and (iv) focus on proposing \npractical solutions. As many other countries in the Pacific are struggling to put in place sustainable \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n6  Bauder & Associates of Hawaii, under contract to the MOH, developed a proposal for a conventional insurance \nprogram in 1995. In 1999, the World Bank and the World Health Organization provided some assistance to Palau to \nreview the Bauder Plan and produce a modified version for legislative consideration. However, no serious action was \ntaken on the proposals. \n ", "4   \nfinancing plans, outputs from this TA will be shared with other countries during regional technical \nworkshops and other forums. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.   The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill  provide  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  to  finance  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  furniture, \nadministrative support and data collection services, provision of transport, and local logistical \narrangements. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency (EA) for the TA. The MOF has \nappointed the Ministry of Health (MOH) as the Implementing Agency. The Planning and Budget \nDepartment of the MOF will assign a member of staff to assist the consultant(s) in data collection \nand collation. ADB will provide MOF with an indicative list of the types of data required before the \nstart of phase I. A second member of staff will be assigned in the MOH to help the consultant(s) \nwith logistical arrangements and data gathering. The Government will assure and facilitate access \nby the consultant(s) to all the required data for analytical work under the TA. The TA will be \nimplemented in a consultative manner, using a working group of four to six stakeholders and \nexperts. The minister of health will be the primary in-country advisor on implementation of the TA \nand will select and invite key people to participate in the working group. \n \n16.  ADB financing will support a total of 14 person-months of international consulting services \nfor both phases of the TA: a health economist (4 person-months), a health policy and financing \nexpert (5 person-months), an actuary (3 person-months), and a health services administration \nexpert (2 person-months). ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Given the highly specialized \nknowledge  sought,  along  with  relevant  regional  experience,  consultants  will  be  appointed  as \nindividuals. This is expected to be manageable as the number of consultants is small and the TA \nwill be implemented in a phased way. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \nThe total expected duration of the TA is 14 months. Phase I will be implemented over 4 months, \nbeginning  in  June  2008,  and  phase  II  will  be  implemented  over  8  months,  beginning  about \nNovember 2008. There will be a 1\u20132 month interval between the two phases to allow for findings \nfrom phase I to be collated and considered.7 National elections are also scheduled to take place \nduring this interim period. \n17.   Within 1 month of TA implementation, the team leader for phase I will submit an inception \nreport, which will include findings on data quality and gaps (including the feasibility of constructing \na national health account) and the key policy questions to be addressed in the final report (as \nagreed to by stakeholders). The team leader will also submit a final report outlining findings on the \nfinancial viability of the NHSP, policy issues, and recommendations for improving its scope and \nfiscal sustainability. Within 2 months of the beginning of phase II, the team leader for phase II will \nsubmit an inception report outlining the outcome of initial stakeholder consultations, clarification of \nthe main health financing problems and priorities to be addressed, and recommendations for \ndeveloping a sustainable health financing scheme. The team leader will also submit a final report \ncomprising a policy proposal on a feasible and sustainable health financing scheme for Palau, \nincluding administrative capacity requirements. Working group sessions will be held regularly \n                                                 \n7 The suggested interval between phases will not affect financial administration of the TA. ", "  5\nduring  TA  implementation.  Wider  consultations  will  take  place  at  the  end  of  each  phase  to \ndisseminate findings to policy makers and the public. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of the Republic of Palau for the Development of a Sustainable Health Financing \nScheme, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  Assumption \nPublic expenditures on  Fiscal sustainability attained  Hospital balance sheets  Government commitment to \nhealthcare services is  (i.e., improved balance in    improving sustainability of \nfinancially sustainable.  health spending and  Government annual  health financing \navailable revenue) by 2012:  budget reports and   \n  national accounts  Risk \n(i) At least (2) measures to    Significant reduction in \nimprove cost-efficiency/  National health accounts  Compact funds and United \ncost-recovery of hospital    States federal grants leads to \nservices introduced by 2012  Public expenditure reviews unprecedented budget cuts \n(e.g., spending more on     \nprevention services).
