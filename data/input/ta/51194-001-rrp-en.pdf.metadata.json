THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shandong Green Development Fund Project. \n \n2.  The project will pilot an innovative leveraging mechanism to catalyze private, institutional, \nand commercial (PIC) capital for the development of climate-positive infrastructure and business \nin  Shandong  Province.1 It  will  support  a  portfolio  of  mitigation  and  adaptation  subprojects \nassessed against both climate and financial eligibility criteria. The project will contribute to the \nprovince\u2019s transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient development patterns. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The PRC plays a pivotal role in managing the climate change challenge in Asia and the \nPacific. Given the country\u2019s current level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate \nvulnerability, there is a vast need for climate-related investments going beyond business as usual \nto underpin its development targets.2 With high reliance on coal power and heavy industry, \nShandong Province is initiating systemic interventions to build climate resilience and decarbonize \nits economy. The province has a population of about 100 million and ranks eighth in the PRC in \nterms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Shandong Province has a similar economic \nstructure to that of the PRC with a rapid industrial development and high GHG emissions.3  \n \n4.  Since 2010, the Government of the PRC, with the support of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  and  other  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs),  has  established  a  strong  policy \nframework for climate change to promote ecological civilization rather than a GDP-oriented \ndevelopment.4 To support this paradigm shift and address the high level of vulnerability to climate \nchange, the PRC committed to new climate actions through its Intended Nationally Determined \nContribution (INDC) signed under the Paris Agreement.5 The Work Plan for Controlling GHG \nEmissions During the 13th Five-Year Period has set specific tasks and measurable and binding \nGHG emissions control goals by 2020.6 Shandong Province aims for carbon dioxide (CO ) \n2\nemissions to peak around 2027, three years earlier than the INDC (around 2030).  \n  \n5.  Shandong Province is making efforts to scale up climate investments, but public sector \nresources  are  scarce  and  insufficient  to  meet  the  huge  financing  needs.  Private  sector \nparticipation is required to bridge the funding gap and to bring in expertise, efficiency, and \nadvanced technologies. A new approach beyond traditional financing and banking modalities is \nneeded to unlock significant climate finance. The project is designed to catalyze PIC finance at \nscale  for  a  new  generation  of  climate-positive  subprojects  with  perceived  high  risks  that, \notherwise, may not be attractive to commercial investors. The project will cater to climate financing \nrequirements for longer-term, flexible structuring and competitive pricing; build climate finance \n                                                \n1  At least 70% of the subprojects financed (in line with the fund commitment) need to be located in Shandong Province. \n2  In 2016, the PRC was the largest GHG emitter worldwide\u2014accounting for just under one-third of global emissions \n(10,151 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in the PRC versus 36,183 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \nworldwide); the Global Climate Risk Index ranks the PRC as the 12th most affected country by extreme weather \nevents and estimates financial losses amounting to $82 billion and economic losses up to 3.5% GDP. \n3  It is PRC\u2019s largest coal and energy consumer (about 10% of the country\u2019s consumption). \n4  Harmony between humans and nature, resulting in a low- carbon economy. \n5  United Nations. 2016.

Beijing. \n ", "2 \ncapacity and knowledge; and provide policy advice. It will help overcome barriers such as \naffordability constraints, first-mover risks, behavioral risks, and low-technology penetration rates. \nThe project design represents a paradigm shift over the business as usual climate-related \ninvestment, which typically complies with local regulations with minimum climate impacts. This is \ncritical for Shandong Provincial Government (SPG) to meet its aggressive climate targets. As \nsuch, the Shandong Green Development Fund (SGDF) will function as the financial arm of the \nSPG to support its proactive climate policies, and crowd in PIC investors to fund subprojects which \nproduce climate change public goods and positive externalities. \n \n6.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  to  facilitate  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda of managing climate change.7 It supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational plan of tackling climate change by fully integrating climate change mitigation and \nadaptation  into  the  project  design,  contributing  to  increase  climate  finance  targets,  and \naccelerating low GHG development in line with the PRC INDC.8 The project contributes to the \nSustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)\u2014especially  SDG  9:  Industry,  Innovation,  and \nInfrastructure, by building climate-resilient infrastructure and fostering a new climate finance \nmodel;  and  SDG  13:  Climate  Action,  by  taking  urgent  actions  to  promote  climate-related \ninvestments to combat climate change impacts. ADB has long-term engagement in the PRC\u2019s \nenvironment-related financing initiatives such as the Low Carbon City Program; the Yangtze River \nEconomic Belt Framework; and the Air Quality Improvement Program in the Greater Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Region. Under the Air Quality Improvement Program, ADB approved an investment \nloan for Shandong Province in 2018 targeting mitigation, energy efficiency, and air quality \nimprovement at county level administrations with low capacity.9 Based on these experiences and \nin partnership with the PRC agencies, the project is meant to have a catalytic, qualitatively \ndifferent role in relation to climate finance and to complement other facilities. \n \n7.  Priority sectors. Shandong Province was designated to pilot a shift to a low-carbon and \nclimate-resilient growth paradigm that could be replicated nationwide if successful.10 The portfolio \ndistribution  (Table  1)  of  the  SGDF  is  guided  by  a  GHG  profile  and  climate  vulnerability \nassessment, which analyzes where climate financing can have most impacts to achieve the \nprovincial policy objectives and is summarized in the climate change assessment. 11,12 The \nassessment concluded that the main sources of GHG emissions in Shandong Province are in the \nenergy production sector, buildings, and the rapidly growing urban transport, resulting in the \nSGDF\u2019s mitigation priorities (i) renewable energy production, including wind, solar, biomass, and \ngeothermal; (ii) green buildings; and (iii) low-carbon transport.13 The SGDF\u2019s adaptation priorities \nare irrigation and integrated urban water management, including flood proofing, through low-\nimpact development (sponge cities); and coastal protection. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016.

Shandong  Green  Development  Fund  structure. The  SGDF  is  a multi-tiered fund \nstructure to accommodate a timing difference between the ADB loan (20 years) and investment \nhorizon of the PIC investors (up to 10 years). It includes a 20-year catalytic fund holding the seed \ncapital from the IFIs. The IFIs and public funding will then be blended with PIC capital at an initial \ntarget ratio 45:55 into a series of shorter-term funds (8 to 10 years) to match the investment \nhorizon of PIC investors to finance climate-positive subprojects. The SGDF will be structured as \nlimited partnerships and managed by a top-tier fund manager. Any qualified subproject financed \nunder the project will comply with the provisions set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n9.  Shandong Green Development Fund investment strategy. The SGDF\u2019s investment \nstrategy consists of facilitating the transition to a low-carbon future and to both encourage the \ndevelopment of climate-positive subprojects and leverage its public funding in Shandong Province. \nThe objective is to tap new funding sources and leverage existing sources of finance into a \npipeline of viable climate-positive investments by (i) ensuring the SGDF addresses priority climate \nimpacts and vulnerabilities in Shandong Province, where at least 70% of the investment is \ntargeted; (ii) incorporating a project development mechanism funded under the output 2 capacity \ndevelopment  program to  develop  a  pipeline  of  climate-positive,  sustainable,  and replicable \nsubprojects based on high level of performance against the SGDF Green Climate Assessment \nGuidelines; (iii) incorporating structures for leveraging PIC finance, targeting pension funds, \ninsurance companies, commercial banks, and corporate investors in the SGDF and in the \nsubprojects; and (iv) bringing into subprojects the expertise from the private sector and advanced \ntechnologies.14 By establishing clear definitions, guidelines, and systems for climate finance \nfollowing  international  best  practices,  the  SGDF  will  ensure  transformational  change  with \nadequate risk mitigation. \n \n10.  Shandong Green Development Fund selection criteria. Any subprojects that contribute \nto climate change mitigation (measured through GHG/CO eq emissions reduction) or climate \n2\nchange adaptation (measured through improvement of the beneficiaries\u2019 resilience) that meet \neligibility criteria in the Project Administration Manual (PAM) may be considered for investment.15 \nAll investments will be screened with the criteria set under the SGDF Green Climate Assessment \nGuidelines  (footnote  14).  Subprojects  will  be  enhanced  through  the  capacity  development \nprogram to maximize their climate benefits and the adoption of high-level technologies. All \ninvestments will be evaluated based on financial, economic, commercial, legal and safeguards \ndue diligence. \n \n11.  Climate investment process. All subprojects must be financially sustainable and bring \n                                                \n14 Shandong Green Development Fund Green Climate Assessment Guidelines (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2 and as an appendix to the project administration manual developed during project \npreparation and based on the Green Climate Fund Investment Framework). \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "4 \nmeasurable and positive climate impacts. They will be screened with the SGDF Green Climate \nAssessment Guidelines (footnote 14) and categorized under the guidelines as exhibiting \u201cgood \npractices\u201d or \u201cadvanced benefits\u201d or being \u201ctransformational\u201d depending on the climate impacts.16 \nThe SGDF\u2019s investment process will incorporate screening, monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and \nverification (MERV) of the climate performance of the subprojects. The SGDF will link financing \nterms to the level of climate benefits of the subprojects. By mobilizing public and catalytic funding, \nthe project can prioritize financing to subprojects with higher climate impacts (expected to be \ncategorized \u201ctransformational\u201d or \u201cadvanced benefits\u201d) and possibly higher financial risks, thereby \nestablishing bankability support conditions and incentivizing structures linked to climate results. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: peaking of CO  emissions around 2030 \n2\nor earlier on best efforts achieved.17 The project will have the following outcome: climate resilience \nin Shandong Province enhanced.18 \n \n13.  Output 1: Shandong Green Development Fund established with private, institutional, \nand commercial financing leveraged. The SGDF will be structured as an investment pooling \nvehicle for climate financing and run by a professional fund management company (FMC). The \nSGDF will target investing 75% in mitigation, measured through carbon dioxide equivalent \n(CO eq) emissions reduction; and 25% in adaptation, measured through improvement of the \n2\nbeneficiaries\u2019 resilience. By 2027, the project is expected to reduce CO2eq emissions by 2.5 \nmillion tons per year and directly build resilience for at least 2 million people in Shandong \nProvince. The project will leverage PIC funding at a market rate in both SGDF and subprojects, \nwith reinvesting occurring from years 5 to 15. \n \n14.  Output 2: Knowledge and skills of local governments, civil society, and private \nsector to prepare climate-positive subprojects enhanced. The FMC will manage a capacity \ndevelopment program financed under the loan to provide: (i) consulting services for design\u2013\nreview\u2013advice to improve the quality of the subproject proposals and maximize climate benefits; \n(ii) MERV for green climate ratings of subprojects and portfolios; and (iii) capacity development, \nespecially for safeguards and disbursement procedures and policy advisory to the SPG to define \nits climate policies for the next five-year plan (2021\u20132025). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s participation is considered critical for the design and establishment of the SGDF, \nbenchmarked to international green and climate best practices in the following aspects. \n \n16.  Leveraging effect. ADB will provide and mobilize the IFIs\u2019 catalytic funding, on which the \nSGDF depends, to attract local public resources and maximize PIC capital flows into climate-\npositive subprojects. SGDF financing will be targeted (climate-related investment), time-bound \n(3\u201310 years), and transitional (up to 67% of subproject costs for up to 10 years). The project\u2019s \ndesign positions the SGDF as an anchor investor to help catalyze significant additional resources. \nBy revolving distributions from shorter-term funds, the SGDF will finance a large number of \nclimate-positive subprojects over the 20-year project life span. IFIs\u2019 contribution to the SGDF \n(about \u20ac260 million) is expected to achieve a leveraging ratio over five. In addition, the level of \n                                                \n16 Such terms are defined in the Shandong Green Development Fund Green Climate Assessment Guidelines. \n17 Government of the PRC. 2015. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution. Paris. \n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "5 \ncatalytic funding enables the SGDF to enter subsectors (e.g., low-impact development, sponge \ncities, urban and rural sanitation, green transport, and the circular economy), which otherwise \ncannot undertake structural change because of the higher cost of climate-positive investment. \n  \n17.  Comprehensive climate investment framework. ADB has designed the assessment \nand final selection of climate-positive subprojects based on climate impacts and benefits (which \nwill be maximized) and bankability (which will be improved). The shift from business as usual, \ncomplying with national legislation, to subprojects delivering advanced and transformational \nbenefits, is supported by the stricter green climate investment criteria enshrined in the loan and \nproject agreements. The project will also incentivize subprojects to adopt green procurement \nstandards,19 as greening a subproject\u2019s supply chain such that it shifts from \u201cgood practices\u201d to \n\u201cadvanced benefits\u201d will enable access to better financing terms and conditions from the SGDF.  \n \n18.  Project development. The SGDF will promote the adoption of SOURCE, a multilateral \ndigital platform initially developed by ADB and adopted by other IFIs and the private sector, to \nfast-track the delivery of quality infrastructure projects.20 SOURCE is designed to help public \nsector agencies better prepare, manage, and publish their infrastructure projects to attract private \nsector investors. This cloud-based system allows the FMC to present information on all aspects \nof  the  development  of  an  infrastructure  project  for  consistency,  quality,  transparency,  and \naccountability using sector-specific templates. A comprehensive digital platform for an enhanced \nproject management information system for MERV facilitates reporting to the IFIs and the central \nand provincial governments.21   \n \n19.  Knowledge management. The project concept was based on an ADB publication on \n\u201cCatalyzing Green Finance\u201d.22 Shandong Province is piloting the project, which ADB is scaling up \nnationally through the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in the PRC; and in Southeast Asia \n(Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Indonesia) and Mongolia.23 A knowledge product \nunder preparation will further disseminate lessons learned during the SGDF project preparation.24  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n20.  The government has requested a financial intermediation loan of \u20ac88.73 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 20-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 15 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nBased on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 17.75 years, and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.20% per year.  \n \n                                                \n19 The Green Procurement Manual (accessible from the list of Supplementary Documents in Appendix 2) was \ndeveloped during the project preparation and customized from European Union standards. \n20 SOURCE. http://sif-source.org. \n21 Financed by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund (financing partner: Government of \nLuxembourg) and administered by ADB and developed during the project preparation. \n22 ADB. 2017.

ADB will finance (i) investments in qualified \nenterprises by funds to pay for goods, works, and services for qualified subprojects; (ii) the costs \nof operating the funds, including taxes and duties; and (iii) capacity development (mostly services, \nbut potentially also goods). \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  (\u20ac million)  (%) \nSovereign  263.73  44.0 \nADB (ordinary capital resources financial \n88.73  14.8 \nintermediation loan) \nKfWa  100.00  16.7 \nAFDa  75.00  12.5 \nPublicb  322.39  53.8 \nQingdao Municipal Governmentc  322.39  53.8 \nPrivateb  12.90  2.2 \nGeneral partnersd  12.90  2.2 \nTotal  599.02  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank ; AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. \nNote: Includes taxes and duties; such amount does not represent an excessive share of the project cost since limited \npartner contributions and profits are not taxed at the fund level but at the corporate level. \na  German development cooperation through KfW is reapproving a loan of \u20ac100 million and signed a collaborative \ncofinancing memorandum of understanding with ADB.  \n  AFD is approving a loan of \u20ac75 million and is signing a collaborative cofinancing memorandum of understanding \nwith ADB. \nb  Public and private investors\u2019 contributions are in yuan equivalent. \nc  Qingdao will provide 25% of the funds commitment (up to CNY2.5 billion). \nd  The contribution from general partners is 1% of the fund commitment, expected to be CNY10 billion. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22.  Collaborative cofinancing with German development cooperation through KfW and the \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) is needed to achieve a critical mass of catalytic \nfunding to leverage significant PIC capital. Additional catalytic funding may be sought later, \nespecially from the Green Climate Fund. PIC funding is expected to be more than 50% (about \n\u20ac690 million) of the total investment cost for the SGDF and from one-third to two-thirds of the total \ninvestment cost for the subprojects.  \n \n23.  Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $75 million and climate adaptation is estimated to \ncost $25 million. ADB will finance 15% of total mitigation and adaptation costs.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  SPG is the executing agency, represented by Shandong Province Finance Bureau. SPG \nis establishing the SGDF under an experienced financial intermediary, Shandong Development \n& Investment Holding Group (SDIHG), a state-owned enterprise wholly owned by SPG, as the \nimplementing agency. SDIHG operates under the PRC Company Law, 2018 and is financially \nautonomous. As a provincial investment platform to support infrastructure development and \nindustrial transformation, SDIHG has experience in ensuring that planned investments meet \nbroader policy requirements. Qingdao Municipal Government will invest in the SGDF to (i) \nstrengthen Qingdao as a regional green investment center and (ii) leverage its contribution with \nPIC finance to fund climate-positive urban infrastructure and business locally. A fund manager \nincorporated in the PRC, CICC Capital Management Co., Ltd. (CCM), a subsidiary of a leading \ninvestment bank, China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC), was selected by SDIHG \nto manage the SGDF based on the criteria required by the IFIs: (i) top-ranked asset manager in \nthe  PRC  in  terms  of  track  record,  size  of  assets  under  management,  governance,  risk \n ", "7 \nmanagement, and management profile; (ii) licensed by the regulator to operate a fund in the PRC; \n(iii) more than 8 years\u2019 experience, including opening and closing a fund; and (iv) experience with \npublic and IFI funding mechanisms. CCM has assets under management of CNY300 billion \nacross more than 20 funds with extensive experience in setting up and managing commercialized \nfunds, including mandates from the central and local governments to realize strategic visions. \n \n25.  Shandong Province Finance Bureau receives the loan proceeds from the Ministry of \nFinance, maintains the foreign currency account, and transfers the proceeds to SDIHG in local \ncurrency for investment in a 20-year catalytic fund, which will manage and revolve the long-term \ncatalytic funding from IFIs, including ADB, into a series of shorter-term funds that reflect PIC \ninvestors\u2019 investment horizons in line with market practices. Generally, the shorter-term funds will \nhave an investment period of 4 to 5 years, an exit period of about 3 years, and a possible 2-year \nextension period to complete exits from investments in an orderly manner. Using their own funds, \nCCM and SDIHG will invest in the SGDF as co-general partners. Distributions from the shorter-\nterm funds will be made to the catalytic fund for reinvestment, except as distributed to SDIHG to \npay its debt service on onlent IFI debt. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s no-objection will be required before the ADB loan is disbursed to any fund and to \nthe first three subprojects. Subprojects and investees that receive more than the limit of \u20ac70 \nmillion will also require ADB\u2019s no-objection.25 The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 15). \n  \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2020\u2013December 2026 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Shandong Provincial Government \n(ii)  Key implementing agency  Shandong Development & Investment Holding Group \n(iii)  Implementing unit (fund  CICC Capital Management Co., Ltd. with offices in Qingdao (headquarters) \nmanagement company)  and Jinan, Shandong, and Beijing (total staff 46)  \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the project will be carried out in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and regulations for financial intermediation loans. \nConsulting services  QBS (green rating)  1 contract  $1.0 million \nICS (MERV, PDF, capacity  Person-months:  $8.5 million \ndevelopment, knowledge  International (180) and   \nmanagement)  national (480), as required  $0.5 million \nRPS (policy workshops) \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; ICS = individual consultant selection; MERV = monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and \nverification; PDF = project development facility; QBS = quality-based selection; RPS = resource person selection \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n25 An investment shall be deemed to exceed the limit if the amount of such investment, when added to the amount of \nall other investments previously made or authorized by the relevant fund for the same subproject or the same investee \ncompany, exceeds the limit. The FMC will submit to ADB an application for approval of the investment, with a \ndescription and appraisal of the subproject, the financial terms and conditions, and draft investment agreement. \n ", "8 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  ADB validated the SGDF Green Climate Assessment Guidelines (footnote 14) and the \nCO eq emissions reduction, as well as the environmental and social co-benefits, on 10 subproject \n2\nconcepts, including three pre-feasibility studies26   \n(i)  Transformational  Energy  Management  for  Zero  Energy\u2013Zero  Waste  at \nExpressway Service Centers: low-carbon\u2013circular economy of service stations \nalong the expressways, based on a micro grid for energy management from \nrenewable energy; systematic enhancement of energy saving, allowing the setting \nup of service stations in isolated and remote areas without access to electricity. \n(ii)  Solar Smart-Grid for Inclusive Access to Information and Communication \nTechnology:  inclusive  photovoltaic  power  generation  for  telecom  towers  for \nmobile phones, WiFi, and Internet of Things equipped with solar panels. \n(iii)  Large-Scale  Biomass  Delivers  Decarbonization:  carbon  storage  biomass \nrenewable energy production in peri-urban areas.  \n \n28.  The total costs of those three indicative subprojects are more than $600 million, with a \ntotal CO eq emissions reduction of 3.5 million tons per year corresponding to a displacement of \n2\nabout 178,000 tons of coal and resulting in an annual reduction of 2,000 tons of nitrogen oxide \nand 3,700 tons of sulfur dioxide. One subproject linked to fossil fuels (improving boiler efficiency) \nwas dropped and the other six subprojects are under preparation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  Financial analysis was prepared to demonstrate that the SGDF will provide satisfactory \nreturns from investments in climate-positive subprojects. 27 The analysis was prepared under the \nfollowing assumptions: (i) type of financing, debt or equity; (ii) targeted portfolio allocation by \nclimate performance; (iii) financing terms and conditions, linked with climate performance; (iv) \nnonperforming asset ratio; and (v) portfolio allocation by direct investments in subprojects and \nsub-funds. For debt financing, the assumptions were tailored to provide attractive funding to \nclimate subprojects, reflecting the catalytic terms of the funding from IFIs. The financial analysis \nshows that the investments will provide a return to the PIC investors that is commensurate with \nmarket standards and will provide a lower return for the funding from the public investors, \nconsistent with the project design: to use catalytic and public money to crowd in PIC finance and \nprovide affordable financing for climate-positive subprojects. Under the assumptions made, the \nfinancial analysis shows that SGDF will provide sufficient cash flow to SDIHG to repay the IFI \ndebt and will provide the SGDF\u2019s private investors with a return on their higher cost of capital \ninvested and return expectations. \n \n30.  Economic analysis prepared for the same indicative subprojects included the main co-\nbenefit of GHG emissions reduction, valued based on recommendation by the Intergovernmental \nPanel  on  Climate  Change.28, 29 Other  co-benefits  were  reduced  air  pollutants,  gases,  and \nwastewater pollution. The economic analysis showed that the economic co-benefits added \nsignificant value to the overall business case and a minimum of 35% to the main financial benefits. \n                                                \n26  Pre-feasibility studies (accessible from the list of Supplementary Documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2019.

Geneva. \n ", "9 \nThe economic internal rate of return analysis for the indicative subprojects showed returns of \nmore than 14% estimated in real terms. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n31.  The sustainability of the SGDF relies on the efficiency and effectiveness core indicators, \npreliminarily estimated at (i) $4 per ton of CO eq (tCO eq) for the ADB cost over the expected \n2 2\nlifetime emissions reduction of the project, and (ii) $60 per tCO eq for the total CNY10 billion \n2\nSGDF. Performance by sector (mitigation only) is established and benchmarked against the \nMcKinsey China Cost-Abatement calculations, adjusted for improvements in technology and \ncurrent costs.30 The SGDF incentive structure encourages investee companies to improve climate \nperformance in relation to the relevant benchmarks so they can access better financing terms. \nThe FMC managing the SGDF is one of the top tier fund managers in the PRC, with enough \ninvestment experience to build the capacity of the stakeholders. Under an agreement with the \nimplementing agency, the FMC will undertake the procurement for the capacity development \nprogram and will oversee procurement by the investee companies. The SGDF excludes projects \nclassified category A for both environment and involuntary resettlement and categories A and B \nfor indigenous peoples. The Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) to be agreed \nbetween ADB and the FMC, and the Gender Action Plan (GAP), apply to the entire SGDF.31 The \nproject  monitors  subprojects\u2019  beneficiaries,  including  vulnerable  people,  through  the \nsocioeconomic data disaggregated by gender and recorded in the MERV report. \n \n32.  The  ADB  project  team  worked  with  development  partners\u2014the  China  Council  for \nInternational Cooperation on Environment and Development, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme, and PIC funds\u2014on cofinancing, policy development, institutional arrangements, and \nharmonizing  safeguard  principles  and  requirements  across  cofinanciers.  The  subprojects\u2019 \nfeasibility studies provide the expected environmental, social and health, and economic and \nenvironmental co-benefits, as well as gender consideration. Each subproject must demonstrate \nthat it has considered ways to (i) maximize the local economic benefits of the proposed investment \nand (ii) incorporate gender-sensitive design features to enhance women\u2019s inclusion. Subprojects \nshould be designed to provide opportunities for enhancing employment either directly or indirectly \nthrough  enhanced  productivity,  skills,  and  competitiveness  as  documented  in  the  gender \nframework.32 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n33.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial mainly because of \nthe greenfield nature of the SGDF. The financial management assessment, as part of a broader \nassessment of institutional performance, covers the financial and legal status; accounting staffing; \naccounting policies and procedures; fund flow arrangements; financial reporting and monitoring \nprocedures  and  practice;  financial  management  information  systems  in  place;  and  the \nrequirements, guidelines, and results of internal and external audits.33 The results showed that \nthe financial management systems and procedures put in place and strengthened by CCM as the \n                                                \n30 McKinsey  and  Company.  2009.

The external audit reports from 2015 to 2018 for SDIHG and CCM \nhave unqualified opinions. As one of the investment vehicles in Shandong Province, SDIHG fully \ncomplies with local regulations and is under the oversight of the provincial government agencies. \nCCM qualifies as a \u201cinstitution of private investment funds\u201d by the Asset Management Association \nof China. SDIHG and CCM are confirmed to have adequate financial management capacity to \nmanage the project. ADB will review and issue no objection on all the key fund documents and \ntemplates to ensure compliance with ADB requirements. \n \n34.  All  procurement  for  subprojects  financed  under  the  project  must  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  policy  and  regulations  for  financial  intermediaries.34 \nProcurement, including the recruitment of consultants, must follow the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time). A procurement capacity assessment of the implementing agency \nand a procurement assessment of private sector commercial practice concluded that the overall \nprocurement risk for the project is moderate since the SGDF concept is being pilot tested. The \nFMC will be responsible for the procurement activities for the capacity development program. \n \n35.  Investee  companies  will  undertake  procurement  under  the  loan  in  accordance  with \nestablished private sector or commercial procurement practices that are acceptable to ADB. \nInvestee companies may use open competitive bidding for the purchase of large single items or \nin  cases  of  large  quantities  of  goods  for  bulk  purchasing.  All  procurement  will  ensure \n(i) reasonable prices as a result of preferably competitive procedures, (ii) procurement from \neligible source countries, and (iii) fair canvassing and/or evaluation. \n \n36.  Integrity due diligence was conducted on the project stakeholders, especially CCM and \nSDIHG.35 No significant integrity risks were identified. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, SDIHG, and CCM. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote \n15). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  The project is expected to improve the resilience to climate change impacts of 2 million \npeople in Shandong Province by 2027. Social co-benefits include improved cultural preservation, \nhealth, and safety. ADB social development and safeguards policies need to be addressed \nadequately in the subprojects to ensure community involvement, limit negative health impacts, \nand promotes safety. The project leads to active adoption of climate-positive action and ensures \nthat  investment  benefits  are  shared  by  lower-income  or  vulnerable  groups  in  terms  of \nemployment, community participation, and quality of life. The project includes an output on \ncapacity development to finance knowledge products, workshops, community outreach, and \nspecific education programs designed to meet ADB\u2019s social objectives. Environmental co-benefits \ninclude improved air quality, water and soil quality, and biodiversity. For the SGDF, the output of \n2.5 million tons of CO eq reduction per year displaces about 10 million tons of coal, resulting in a \n2\nreduction of 80,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 70,000 tons of sulfur oxide. \n \n38.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, with gender-specific indicators in \nthe design and monitoring framework (footnote 18).

This will be the first climate fund in the PRC that \nsystematically  integrates  gender  equality  considerations  in  the  requirements  for  subproject \nfinancing. Under the SGDF, all proposed subprojects are required to conduct a social analysis \nand  gender  assessment.  As  an  incentive  to  promote gender  equality  in  climate financing, \nsubprojects that identify specific gender design features and prepare a GAP will move to the \n\u201cadvanced benefits\u201d or \u201ctransformational\u201d category, enabling access to better financial terms. The \nSGDF has set an ambitious target of 50% for projects preparing a GAP, to be financed by the \ninvestee companies with monitoring by the FMC.  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n39.  Due  diligence  findings  show  that,  while  CCM  has  a  strong  record  in  corporate \nenvironmental and social governance, it has no specific environment and social policies in place \nor dedicated procedures beyond a requirement under national laws and regulations to avoid, \nminimize and mitigate, or compensate the adverse impacts of subprojects on the environment \nand affected people. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), an ESMS \narrangement  has  been  prepared.36 The  ESMS  arrangement  details:  (i)  the  exclusion  of \nsubprojects that fall under category A for environment and involuntary resettlement, and the \nexclusion of subprojects that fall under categories A and B for indigenous peoples; (ii) setting up \nof the FMC, which includes the establishment of a safeguards unit with two full-time staff and \nresources to strengthen staff capacity; and (iii) the preparation of an ESMS to be agreed between \nADB and the FMC as a condition of the first disbursement.  \n \n40.  Environment  and  involuntary  resettlement  (category  FI).  The  project  excludes \ncategory A subprojects from financing by the SGDF. For category B and C subprojects, it will \nrequire ADB\u2019s review and approval of the required safeguard documents for the first three \nsubprojects or until such time that ADB confirms that the FMC safeguards unit is fully staffed and \nhas  sufficient  capacity  to  do  their  own  due  diligence  and  review  of  safeguards  planning \ndocuments; and any subproject above the limit of \u20ac70 million.37 Semiannual monitoring reports \nand annual consolidated environmental and social reports will be submitted to ADB for review. \n \n41.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  FI-C).  The  project  does  not  target  any  distinct  or \nvulnerable indigenous people groups and is not expected to have adverse impacts on ethnic \nminority groups. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n42.  The project preparation for the SGDF with SPG and the cofinanciers provided a robust \ndesign in which risk management and risk mitigation  are evaluated. The level of financial \nmanagement risk that could affect project performance is considered substantial because of the \ngreenfield nature of the SGDF. The MERV and the FMC\u2019s established operational tools are \nexpected to mitigate most of the risks. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.38 \n \n                                                \n36 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).
