THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Uttarakhand Integrated and Resilient Urban Development Project. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Enhancing Climate Resilience in Uttarakhand \nUrban Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Uttarakhand in enhancing access to high-\nquality and resilient water supply and sanitation (WSS) services in Dehradun and in upgrading \nsanitation facilities in Nainital. The project will apply a range of integrated, resilient, and innovative \nsolutions: (i) centralized and decentralized sanitation systems and mobile toilets to enhance \ncitywide inclusive sanitation (CWIS); (ii) citywide computerized maintenance and management \nsystems (CMMSs) for WSS, based on smart technology and the first of its kind in India; and \n(iii) various measures to improve climate resilience. The project will also (i) promote behavioral \nchange  toward  water  and  resource  savings,  and  better  hygiene  practices;  (ii)  empower \ncommunities for WSS-related jobs and foster entrepreneurial skills; and (iii) strengthen the \ninstitutional knowledge and capacity of state and local governments for integrated, sustainable, \nand climate-resilient urban development in Uttarakhand. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Uttarakhand, part of the central Himalayas, is a young and fast-growing Indian state \nsupported by manufacturing industries and tourism but confronted with significant climate change \nchallenges. Its urban centers, as the homes of growing industries and gateways to tourism, \nattracted hill villagers who had suffered unstable horticultural conditions because of climate \nchange and sought better opportunities for jobs and education. The rapid urbanization of climate-\nvulnerable areas, and the difficulty in mobilizing sufficient human and financial resources led to \nsignificant gaps in the provision of basic infrastructure and services that also address climate \nchange risks such as increasing water scarcity and extreme droughts and floods. The lack of high-\nquality WSS places a disproportionate burden on the poor, estimated at 15.6% of the population.1 \nIt also greatly pressures women, the key players in household management and family health \ncare, because they spend a lot of time and effort on fetching water and taking care of family \nmembers  sick  from  waterborne  diseases  and/or  poor  hygiene,  rather  than  participating  in \neconomic activities. Given the widespread and prolonged impacts of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic and aggravated climate risks, resilient WSS provision is the topmost \npriority; it is not only essential to human development but also critical to managing climate change \nand protecting people from future pandemic and epidemic diseases. The urban poor who are \nliving in crowded neighborhoods under unhealthy hygiene conditions are particularly exposed to \nthese challenges. \n \n4.  Dehradun, the capital of Uttarakhand, is the most populous city in the state. Its peri-urban \nareas grew at an unprecedented speed because of a huge influx of climate-induced urban \nmigrants.  Compared  with  the  2011  census  data  of  569,578  people  living  in  61  wards  on \n64.6 square kilometers,2 Dehradun now covers 196.48 square kilometers (an increase of 300%) \n \n1  Government  of  Uttarakhand,  Department  of  Planning  and  Institute  for  Human  Development.  2018.  Human \nDevelopment Report of the State of Uttarakhand. New Delhi.  \n2  Census of India. 2011. District census handbook-Dehradun. \n \n ", "2 \nand in 2018 had a population of 803,983 (an increase of 141%) living in 100 wards. Its boundaries \nwere  redrawn  in  2018. 3 Previous  WSS  infrastructure  development  funded  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) covered the pre-2018 city boundaries, and World Bank-funded support \nprovided water supply in parts of the newly created wards. 4 Residents in the remaining areas \neither depend on unreliable water supply systems with significant leaks\u2014receiving only 85 liters \nper capita per day during 3\u20134 hours of water service\u2014or individual wells. Moreover, the water \nscarcity is worsening. The gap is even more significant when it comes to sanitation services\u2014\nDehradun's newly added wards have no sewerage system and people rely on unregulated fecal \nsludge and septage management (FSSM). Untreated wastewater and fecal sludge are directly \ndisposed of into rivers, causing greenhouse gas emissions and severe environmental and health \nrisks.5 These risks can be aggravated during the rainy season, when the effluents get mixed with \nstormwater. Insufficient drainage systems and heavy encroachment of human settlement on the \nriverbeds constrain these rivers from properly performing their natural draining function and \namplify the flooding impacts. Here, too, the situation is worsening as climate change leads to \nlonger and more intense wet seasons. \n \n5.  Nainital, the judicial capital of Uttarakhand, is set in a valley of steep mountains around \nNainital Lake. The estimated population in 2020 was about 60,000,6 or almost 50% more than the \n2011 census data of 41,377.7 Since Nainital is a highly popular hill station,8 it attracts on average \nabout 72,650 daily visitors, of which 90% stay overnight.9 This huge floating population on top of \nan ever-increasing number of urban residents have caused severe water stress. Moreover, an \nobserved depletion of groundwater, which got worse with climate change, and the deteriorating \nwater  quality  of  Nainital  Lake  prompted  the  government  to  restrict  the  duration  of  water \nwithdrawals from tube wells and lake water intake by the water authority in Nainital. The tap water \nservice hours were also reduced,10 despite the water supply infrastructure developments funded \nby ADB (footnote 4). The leaks in the aging trunk sewer (built in 1940) and insufficient capacity of \nthe existing sewage treatment plant (STP) led to sewer gases being emitted into the atmosphere \nand accelerated water pollution, making it difficult to rely on surface water as a climate-adaptive \nsource of water supply. Replacing the leaking trunk sewer and the malfunctioning STP and \nexpanding the sewerage treatment capacity in Nainital are urgent tasks if the city and its WSS \nsystems are to be sustainable and climate-resilient. \n \n6.  The project incorporates lessons from ADB-financed projects in Uttarakhand11 and other \nstates in India\u2014e.g., that (i) reliable WSS system development with household connections and \n \n3  Nagar Nigam Dehradun.

The project is aligned with (i) pillars 2 and 3 of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nIndia, 2018\u20132022 and the mitigation of negative climate change impacts;13 (ii) the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs);14 and (iii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly the operational priorities \nof  (a)  making  cities  more  livable;  (b)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity; \n(c) accelerating progress in gender equality; (d) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (e) addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequality. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n8.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) universal and equitable access to safe \nand affordable drinking water improved, and (ii) access to adequate and equitable sanitation and \nhygiene  enhanced to  end  open  defecation.15 The  project  will  have the  following  outcome: \nreliability and efficiency of resilient WSS services in Dehradun and Nainital enhanced.16 The \nproject has four outputs. \n \n9.  Output 1: Resilient water supply system and service in Dehradun improved. The \nproject will construct about 136 kilometers (km) of water supply pipe systems in newly added \nwards in South Dehradun to replace leaking networks. This will ensure reliable and quality 24-7 \nwater supply services of a standard 135 liters per capita per day. By 2028, the project will also \nprovide water meters to about 5,400 household connections, enabling efficient water use and \nvolumetric billing. This will reduce nonrevenue water (NRW) in the project area from 45%\u201350% \nto no more than 25%, which is better than the state's performance standard.17 Such resilient water \n \n12 The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation has primary responsibility for the state\u2019s WSS. Under it, UJN is \nresponsible for the design and construction of WSS assets in both rural and urban areas, while UJS is responsible \nfor O&M, with the authority to (i) set, revise, and collect tariffs; and (ii) augment the WSS schemes when required. \nAlong with urban reform following the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act in 1992, the transfer of WSS assets and \nthe handover of O&M responsibilities to ULBs are gradually progressing. \n13 ADB. 2017.

Uttarakhand Vision 2030. Delhi: Chauhan Offsets. \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17 The performance standards for water supply services in Uttarakhand limit NRW to 30% at best. ADB is pilot-testing \na smart leak detection assessment and management platform in Dehradun, financed by the ADB-administered \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia Knowledge Partnership Fund, which is expected to improve NRW management. \n \n ", "4 \nsupply systems will lessen the water stress in Dehradun and benefit about 40,000 people, \nincluding about 4,000 urban poor and vulnerable people, by 2028. \n \n10.  Output 2: Integrated and resilient sanitation systems and drainage established in \nDehradun and Nainital. The project will construct (i) two STPs with a total treatment capacity of \n29 million liters per day (MLD); (ii) 256 km of enclosed underground sewer networks to stop \ngreenhouse gas emissions from untreated wastewater; (iii) 117 km of enhanced stormwater \ndrainage  networks  that  factor  in  potential  climate  risks;  and  (iv)  17,410  household  sewer \nconnections, all in Dehradun. This will benefit about 138,000 residents, including 15,000 urban \npoor and vulnerable people by 2028. The project will include FSSM for the households that are \nnot connected to sewer networks within the project areas. Combining these two, the project will \nestablish cost-effective integrated CWIS solutions in Dehradun that are also climate friendly. Once \nhouseholds are connected to the new centralized sewer system, they will no longer need to use \nsoak pits. After cleaning these soak pits and connecting them to the rainwater capturing system, \nthey can be reused as groundwater recharge pits\u2014an innovative solution geared to climate \nadaptation and the circular economy. In Nainital, where the sewerage system has 100% coverage \nand benefits about 154,000 people, the project will (i) replace about 4 km of aging and leaking \ntrunk and outfall sewers; (ii) construct an STP with a treatment capacity of 17 MLD and advanced \nmoving bed biofilm reactor technology to replace an old STP; and (iii) build five additional \nprefabricated compact STPs that meet the challenges of a flood-prone steep hilly town with limited \nland space, each with a capacity of at least 20 kiloliters per day and the same moving bed biofilm \nreactor technology; these STPs are also equipped for the reuse of treated wastewater, which will \nlessen water stress in Nainital. \n \n11.  Aiming to increase access to quality and affordable sanitation and hygiene services for \nresidents and visitors, the project will pilot-test 20 mobile toilets with gender-sensitive and \ninclusive design features.18 Old buses no longer suitable for the transport of people will be \nconverted into mobile toilets and placed in urban areas that lack public toilets.19 The deployment \nof these mobile toilets will prevent open urination and/or defection, stimulate behavioral change \ntoward healthy sanitation practices, and hence contribute to positive health impacts. Mobile toilets \nthat fit into limited land space in Uttarakhand's urban centers are also innovative and climate-\nadaptive solutions during flood events. \n \n12.  Output 3: Computerized maintenance and management systems for water and \nsanitation developed and implemented in Dehradun and Nainital. To advance the O&M \nperformance and the management of WSS assets in Dehradun and Nainital, the project will \nprocure, install, and implement four citywide CMMSs for WSS schemes. Using the internet of \nthings, this information and communication technology-based platform will be integrated with \nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and a geographic information system (GIS) to \nprovide  real-time  data  and  information.  The  platform  can  perform  various  tasks  such  as \n(i) recording and presenting the operational status; (ii) scheduling and tracking inspections; \n(iii) planning, implementing, and reporting the results of preventive maintenance; (iv) managing \nfixed assets across multiple sites; (v) managing inventory, work orders, and contracts; and \n(vi) providing customer services, not least by establishing a consumer data management system \n \n18 Different colors (pink and blue) will indicate the gender designation. Ten pink and 10 blue mobile toilets will also be \nequipped with wheelchair access and other inclusive design features to accommodate all types of users. Pink bus \ntoilets will have enough space for women's hygiene needs, their babies and children, and safe and comfortable \nbreast feeding. \n19 Design\u2013build\u2013operate (DBO) contracts will ensure that the private sector provides high-quality services as well as \nskills and entrepreneurial training to people from local communities, including women living below the poverty line. \n \n ", "5 \nwith data disaggregated by sex, age, and other social dimension.20 The architecture of the \ncitywide CMMSs will be designed so that CMMSs can be expanded and linked with other smart \nplatforms that are under development or will be developed.21 \n \n13.  Output 4: Institutional capacity and knowledge strengthened. The project will  (i) \ndevelop robust WSS O&M manuals that are in line with the national WSS manuals22 but tailored \nto the project cities' WSS system, governance structure, and conditions and needs; (ii) provide \ntraining to UUSDA, UJN, UJS, and project ULBs on the WSS O&M manuals and the CMMSs; \n(iii) carry out community awareness, participation, and behavioral change programs that promote \nwater conservation; sound public health and hygiene practices; waste reduction; and safe, clean, \nand healthy community environments; (iv) implement the gender equality and social inclusion \n(GESI) action plan, including the stipend-based women internship program at UUSDA (para. 28); \n(v) develop  climate  adaptation  support  tools  in  Dehradun  and  Nainital  (para.  19);  and \n(vi) strengthen the institutional capacities of UUSDA, UJN, UJS, and project ULBs for sustainable \nurban infrastructure and services, including WSS tariff restructuring, to manage sustainable,23 \ngreen, and resilient urban planning for livable and prosperous cities, integrated watershed and \nwater management, ecosystem-based adaptation measures,24 and GESI issues in urban systems \nand services. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  ADB provided an additional grant to pilot-test intelligent water leak management systems \nusing (i) innovative sensor-based water leak detection technologies, and (ii) a leak analysis and \ndata  management  information  and  communication  technology  platform  to  advance  NRW \nmanagement (footnote 17). To improve CWIS in Uttarakhand, ADB (i) advised an addition of a \nco-treatment unit to a proposed STP in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, \nand (ii) provided a TA grant to investigate the FSSM service level and performance of private \nFSSM service operators.25 ADB ensures the provision of both household water and sewer \nconnections as a part of civil works. Besides applying SCADA- and GIS-based asset mapping for \nWSS for the first time in Uttarakhand (para. 12), the project also introduces for the first time \nadvanced CMMS solutions to India that will modernize WSS O&M and services with optimized \nefficiency and quality.26 Responding to the state government\u2019s growing concern about climate \n \n20 CMMSs will predict, plan, and schedule preventive maintenance and problem solving; increase equipment life and \nreliability; boost employee productivity; and improve customer satisfaction by preempting problems and handling any \ncomplaints quickly. It is estimated to bring a 20% reduction in equipment downtime, 30% savings in material costs, \na 20% reduction in maintenance repair operations, and a 30% increase in maintenance productivity. \n21 CMMSs will link with ongoing GIS-based property mapping under a World Bank project (footnote 23), a smart leak \ndetection assessment and management platform that is being pilot-tested (footnote 17), and GIS-based fecal sludge \nand septage mapping and assessment under development (footnote 25). \n22 Government of India, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Central Public Health & Environmental Engineering \nOrganisation.

The project will incur an estimated climate mitigation cost of $67.8 million and climate \nadaptation cost of $19.7 million.28 ADB will finance $56.6 million (83.5%) of the mitigation cost \nand $16.5 million (83.7%) of the adaptation cost. Key mitigation measures are the use of energy-\nefficient pumps and equipment, enclosed sewers and advanced sewage treatment technologies, \nresilient sewer networks, and intelligent O&M and asset management systems. Key adaptation \nmeasures are a rainwater harvesting structure, groundwater recharge pits, soak pits reused for \ngroundwater recharge, water supply networks with reduced NRW, flood-resilient STP designs, \nresilient outfalls, and buses converted into mobile toilets. Details are in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).29 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The state government, acting through its Urban Development Department (UDD), will be \nthe executing agency, and UUSDA will be the implementing agency. The project management \nunit  (PMU),  established  under  UUSDA,  is  led  by  the  project  director  of  UUSDA.  Project \nimplementation units with full-time staff delegated from UJN, UJS, ULB, and other government \ndepartments were set up in Dehradun and Nainital. This arrangement will facilitate the smooth \ntransfer of the developed WSS schemes to ULBs after the agreed period of 5-year O&M.30 The \n7-year implementation period provides an adequate cushion for delays in civil works induced by \nthe topographical challenges of hilly terrains, and possible lockdown and activity controls because \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 29). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2021\u2013December 2028 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2028 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2029 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight bodies  General body led by the chief secretary, Government of Uttarakhand;  executive \ncommittee, technical committee, coordination committee, district committees, and \ntown committees \n(ii) Executing agency  Government of Uttarakhand through the Urban Development Department \n \n28 The attached TA will include climate adaptation estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which ADB will finance $1.0 million \nwith $750,000.0 from the Climate Change Fund and $250,000.0 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). Combined, the project and the TA will incur $20.8 million in adaptation costs, of which ADB \nwill finance $17.5 million (84%). \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 During the initial 5-year O&M, UUSDA will remain the asset owner. UJS will collect WSS revenues to finance the \nO&M costs, while the state government will provide gap funding in the event of any shortfall. The WSS schemes will \nthen be transferred to the ULBs, which will operate them with full authority, including tariff setting and collection. \n \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(iii) Key implementing agency  Uttarakhand Urban Sector Development Agency;  \nand (iv) implementation units  Project management unit: 18 staff; PIU-Dehradun: 17 staff; PIU-Nainital: 10 staff \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  1 contract  $809,280 \n(internationally advertised) \nOpen competitive bidding  7 contracts  $119,294,237 \n(nationally advertised) \nConsulting services  CAPPA (QCBS 90:10)  108 person-months  $374,648 \nIASMC (QCBS 90:10)  82 person-months  $1,011,600 \nHGTC (QCBS 90:10)  50 person-months  $337,200 \nNWC (QCBS 90:10)  50 person-months  $337,200 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Government of Uttarakhand requested advance contracting for works and \nadvance contracting  consultants.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n19.  The state of Uttarakhand is part of the central Himalayas, comprising numerous glaciers \nand perennial rivers, and providing water to large parts of the country. Yet, severe water runoff, \nincreasing water demand, extreme floods and droughts, and aggravated water pollution led to \nwater scarcity, particularly in urban centers. Faced with more frequent and extensive impacts from \nclimate-induced  hazards,  like  the  2021  snow-burst  flood  in  the  Chamoli  district,  the  state \ngovernment  requested  ADB\u2019s  support  to  tackle  the  complex  climate-  and  human-induced \nproblems and to find solutions to enhance resilience effectively. Thus, the attached TA will include \n(i) situation analysis, scientific studies, and modeling for various scenarios in Dehradun and \nNainital watersheds; (ii) the development of interactive, map-based climate adaptation support \ntools that provide information on flood- and other hazard-prone zones, various climate-resilient \nsolutions and associated costs, and measures to improve resilience; (iii) the formulation of a \nframework for Uttarakhand's climate resilience, including selection and design of priority resilient \ninvestment  measures  in  upstream  and  downstream  urban  areas;  and (iv) capacity  building \nactivities for climate-resilient planning and development. The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, \nof which (i) $250,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-other sources); and (ii) $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate \nChange Fund. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, \nand other in-kind contributions, equivalent to $100,000. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The project is technically robust based on a comprehensive review of detailed project \nreports, bidding documents, cost estimates, relevant documents, and virtual site investigations. \nThe subprojects, i.e., the physical assets to be built or installed under outputs 1\u20133, meet the \ntechnical criteria of (i) rationale and relevance, benefits, and ease of implementation and O&M; \n(ii) comparison with technical alternatives; (iii) cost-effectiveness; (iv) optimal resource efficiency; \n(v) maximum inclusive beneficiary coverage; and (vi) minimum adverse environmental, social, \n \n ", "9 \nheritage, and climate change impacts. The viability of connecting new and existing pipe networks \nand facilities for smooth system integration is confirmed. Intelligent O&M and asset management, \nCWIS components, advanced sewage treatment technologies, buses converted into mobile \ntoilets, soak pit reutilization, and other climate-resilient measures are key project features. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n21.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis evaluated the economic feasibility of the \nsubprojects to be implemented in two project cities. The estimated combined economic internal \nrate of return is 11.1% (17.2% for the Dehradun water supply subproject, 9.5% for the Dehradun \nsanitation subproject, and 10.7% for the Nainital sewerage subproject), which is higher than the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital estimated at 9.0%, which indicates significant economic \nreturns. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the overall results are satisfactory, except for the \nscenarios of an increase in capital costs and a decrease in benefits, and the combined worst-\ncase scenario for the sanitation and sewerage subprojects in Dehradun and Nainital.  The \nsubprojects' economic viability is expected to further increase if unquantifiable benefits such as \nenvironmental improvements are included in the analysis. The poverty impact ratio is estimated \nat 21.0% for Dehradun water supply, 27.8% for Dehradun sanitation, and 40.6% for Nainital \nsewerage. Based on the currently defined urban people living below the poverty line (12.4% in \nDehradun, 28.8% in Nainital and 10.5% in Uttarakhand State),31 the subprojects are expected to \nconsiderably benefit the poor. \n \n22.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis was conducted for all three subprojects. The \nwater subproject in Dehradun is likely to generate adequate revenues for full O&M cost recovery \nwith regular tariff revisions. The wastewater subprojects in Dehradun and Nainital are unlikely to \ngenerate adequate revenues for full O&M cost recovery without substantial tariff revisions, posing \nrisks to the project\u2019s sustainability. The state government has enabled the revision of tariffs for \nO&M cost recovery, so the financial sustainability risk is moderate. The state government is \ncommitted to ensuring gap funding for the O&M of subprojects through budgetary allocations to \nULBs. ULBs will aim to achieve full O&M cost recovery by (i) adopting a tariff structure more in \nline with costs, (ii) reducing NRW and operational costs, and (iii) improving billing and collection \nefficiency. The state government is already implementing reforms in ULBs aimed at augmenting \ntheir own-source revenue and strengthening the financial management system through adoption \nof better corporate governance structures and a monitoring framework (footnote 23).  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n23.  To ensure the project's sustainability, the state government will implement and monitor \nthe  progress  of  institutional  and  financial  reforms,  ensuring  O&M  recovery  through  tariff \nadjustment and O&M gap funding if an O&M shortfall occurs. In the short-term, 5-year O&M \ncontracts will apply to all subprojects, and the state government has ensured adequate funding \nto UUSDA to make payments to O&M contractors. Longer term, the state government, through \nUDD, will ensure that (i) UUSDA will hand over the subprojects to the respective ULBs after \ncompletion of the 5-year O&M period, (ii) ULBs are legally empowered to set and collect water \nand wastewater tariffs, and (iii) ULBs maintain and operate the assets through own-source \nrevenues in line with the progress of implementation of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act \n(footnotes 12 and 30). \n \n \n31 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2012.

The financial management assessment of UUSDA was carried \nout in accordance with ADB guidelines.32 The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk \nis  substantial.  ADB  and  the  state  government  discussed  enhanced  financial  management \narrangements in detail and agreed on a financial management action plan to mitigate the identified \nrisks  and  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements  throughout \nimplementation. The action plan is included in the PAM (footnote 29). \n \n25.  Procurement. The overall procurement risk is moderate. Strategic procurement planning \nensures that fit-for-purpose approaches are developed to achieve value for money while meeting \ndevelopment objectives. The procurement strategy enhances value for money by making sure \nthat (i) financial bid evaluation includes elements of lifecycle cost evaluation that consider the cost \nof consumables, (ii) private sector involvement through a 5-year design\u2013build\u2013operate (DBO) \ncontract  will  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  asset  owners  and  improve  financial \nsustainability,  and  (iii)  early  completion  bonus  payments  to  DBO  contractors  will  expedite \nconstruction  completion.  All  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the state government, UDD, UUSDA, and the PMU. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 29). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  The project will support SDGs 1, 5, 6, 11, and 13 (footnote 14). Pro-poor design features \ninclude (i) providing free house sewer and water supply connections to poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds;  (ii)  improving  sanitation  services  in  low-lying  and/or  peri-urban  areas  without \nsewerage facilities by establishing a FSSM system; and (iii) conducting awareness and behavioral \nchange campaigns on water and resource conservation, sanitation, and hygiene for project \nbeneficiaries, including the poor. Also, the poor will benefit from employment opportunities during \nproject implementation. \n \n28.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A GESI action plan was \nprepared  based  on  the  project-specific  gender  and  social  analysis.33 Key  features  include \n(i) improved access for 90% of households living below the poverty line, or belonging to scheduled \ntribes, scheduled castes, or other backward castes; (ii) skills training for community women to \nencourage their participation in WSS O&M; (iii) training of female staff and ward members on \nCMMS, sustainable and smart WSS management, and GESI issues in urban systems and \nservices; and (iv) a stipend-based internship program for women. A community awareness and \npublic participation agency will be engaged to support the PMU and the project implementation \nunits in implementing the GESI action plan and the project grievance redress mechanism. \n \n \n32 ADB. 2015. Financial Management Assessment. Manila. \n33 A socioeconomic household survey was conducted in two towns covering 677 households, including 106 households \n(16%) living below the poverty line, besides desktop research and virtual consultations in poor pockets of Dehradun \nand Nainital. Gender analysis shows that, on average, a woman in a poor area spends about 2\u20133 hours a day making \nthree trips for water collection; and 7\u20138 hours in water-related tasks such as cooking, washing, and cleaning. It also \nindicates the need for better institutional capacity to implement gender strategies. \n \n ", "11 \nF.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.34 \n \n30.  Environment (category B). All the subprojects are in urban areas and do not involve \nforest, environmentally sensitive or protected areas, or physical cultural resources. Six draft initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs), including environmental management plans (EMPs), were \nprepared and attached to all the works bid packages based on preliminary designs, confirming no \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  irreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented. \nPotential  environmental  impacts  are  site-specific,  short-term,  and  can  be  mitigated  and/or \nminimized to acceptable levels through design considerations and EMP measures, including a \nCOVID-19-related health and safety plan. The state government will obtain regulatory consents \nand permissions, as required, before contracts are awarded or construction activities begin. Public \nconsultations were conducted in compliance with preventive COVID-19 measures. All the draft \nIEEs were disclosed on the websites of ADB and the state government and will be updated during \ndetailed design and submitted for ADB\u2019s concurrence and disclosure. The state government \ncommitted to have appropriate institutional arrangements and human resources in place, and to \ncarry out capacity building activities to manage environmental safeguards and implement the \nEMPs and the project-specific grievance redress mechanism, as detailed in the PAM (footnote \n29) and the IEEs. All works contracts will contain safeguard provisions. No works will start before \nthe state government has cleared construction-site-specific EMPs with COVID-19-related health \nand safety plans, and ascertained regulatory compliance, and ADB has cleared the updated IEEs. \nThe state government will prepare and disclose semiannual environmental monitoring reports \nduring construction and annual reports during operation. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Six draft resettlement plans were prepared and \nattached to all the six works bid packages in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nand government laws. No land acquisition, physical displacement, or permanent economic \nimpacts are anticipated. It is expected that WSS pipe laying and the ensuing road restoration will \ncause temporary income loss for 88 roadside shop owners (with 465 family members), of whom \n32  are  vulnerable  people.  The  measures  in  the  draft  resettlement  plan  and  monitoring \narrangements are adequate for mitigating the identified impacts. The draft resettlement plans will \nform  part  of  the  contract  documents,  updated  during  detailed  design  based  on  detailed \nmeasurement and census surveys, and submitted to ADB for review before construction works \nstart. The draft and the updated resettlement plans are and will be disclosed to project-affected \npersons and on ADB and project websites. The grievance redress committee will have civil society \nrepresentation and be gender inclusive. The state government has demonstrated the capacity to \nmanage the social safeguards of ADB-financed loans (footnote 4). The proposed capacity building \nprograms as well as project consultants will further bolster the management of involuntary \nresettlement  impacts.  The  state  government  will  prepare  and  disclose  semiannual  social \nmonitoring reports during implementation. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Scheduled tribes reside in the municipal and adjoining \nurban outgrowth areas of Dehradun (0.76% of the population) and Nainital (0.68%). They are \nassimilated in urban society in both cases. It is expected that one person of a scheduled tribe will \nsuffer temporary income loss because of the project (para. 31).  The project will not impact \nindigenous peoples\u2019 groups because it does not involve direct or indirect impacts on their dignity, \n \n34 ADB.
