INTRODUCTION\n1. In implementing its 1999 Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) is bringing to bear the full weight of its resources and business processes in pursuit of\nthe  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction.1  ADB  has  embarked  upon  a  dialogue  with\ngovernments, nongovernment organizations, and the wider civil society, to refine its focus to\nhave the greatest possible impact.\n2. ADB has identified a need to address gaps in knowledge about how different types of\ntransport and energy infrastructure help reduce poverty. A better understanding will enable\nADB to direct its support to those areas with the greatest potential to reduce poverty. For this\npurpose ADB will carry out a regional technical assistance (TA) to assess the impact of\ntransport and energy infrastructure on poverty reduction.2 The TA framework is shown in\nAppendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Transport services and energy supply have direct impacts on the poor. Transport\nboth facilitates the delivery of goods and services, and helps people to gain access to them.\nIt thereby influences poor people\u2019s economic, social, and cultural lives. At the household\nlevel, the poor use energy for heating, refrigeration, cooking, and artificial lighting. In this way\nenergy influences their health, education, and general quality of life.\n4. Transport  and  energy  have  indirect  impacts  on  the  poor  by  facilitating  other\nsocioeconomic development to improve poor people\u2019s incomes and well-being. Virtually all\nthe activities commonly associated with poverty reduction depend indirectly on transport,\nincluding elements of economic growth, such as agriculture, industry, tourism, and mining;\ngovernment services, such as education and health; and social safety nets and emergency\nrelief programs. Similarly, energy supply influences the availability of economic opportunities\nand employment for the poor, and the quality of government services. In some cases,\nimproved transport or energy is an essential requirement for poverty reduction interventions\n(e.g.,  increasing  economic  opportunities  for  people  living  in  remote  areas).  In  others,\ntransport  and  energy  infrastructure  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  increasing  the\nefficiency, growth, and spread of socioeconomic activities. Transport is essential for the free\nmovement of goods and services required for market-based private sector development. It\nhelps to empower the poor by ending their physical isolation, enabling communities to work\ntogether, and giving poor people a voice in society.3\n5. While the existence of these indirect impacts is generally appreciated, there is at\npresent only a limited understanding of their precise nature and extent. It is difficult to trace\nthe complex chain of relationships through which transport and energy indirectly impact upon\npoor people\u2019s lives. The different impacts may sometimes be hard to identify separately. In\nsome cases the impact on individual beneficiaries may be relatively small and hard to\nidentify, although the macro-level impact may be significant. Over a period of some years\ntransport and energy may have dramatic impacts in terms of the transformation of economic\n                                                \n1  R179-99: Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\nBank, approved on 9 November 1999.\n2  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 25 August 2000.\n3 The contribution of transport and energy infrastructure to poverty reduction is likely to vary between and within\ncountries,  depending  on  the  underlying  causes  of  poverty  and  requirements  for  reducing  poverty,  the\nmacroeconomic environment, and cultural and other factors.", "2\nor social activities in the areas served, but their enabling role may not be noticed by outside\nobservers, or may be taken for granted, confused with other factors, or forgotten.\n6. Until now, comparatively little attention has been paid to documenting and quantifying\nthe many influences of transport and energy on poverty reduction. ADB\u2019s project economic\nanalysis has not required this. In the case of transport investments, the main emphasis has\nbeen on demonstrating economic efficiency, based on estimates of the savings in transport\noperating costs and journey time for forecast traffic. Although useful as a test of economic\nsoundness, such analysis offers little insight into how or how much the poor will benefit.\nAnalysis of energy investments has focused on estimating the economic value of the energy\nto be provided, rather than on what the energy will be used for and who it will benefit. This\nconservative  approach  has  been  used  because  it  is  difficult  to  forecast  the  impact  of\ntransport and energy improvements on the numerous socioeconomic activities they make\npossible.\n7. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction goal requires a shift in strategic focus in the transport and\nenergy sectors, from formulating projects on the basis of economic efficiency and economic\nvalue  added  alone,  to  supporting  transport  and  energy  projects  that  best  perform  the\ncomplementary role of facilitating socioeconomic activities that reduce poverty. To do so,\nADB  urgently  needs  to  develop  an  improved  understanding  of  how  different  types  of\ntransport and energy infrastructure fulfill this complementary role, directly and indirectly, and\nto establish benchmarks in quantifying the contribution of transport and energy to poverty\nreduction. This need is shared by other development agencies that have adopted poverty\nreduction  as  their  goal,  including  the  World  Bank,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International\nCooperation (JBIC), and the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United\nKingdom.\n8. There are also important gaps in knowledge about how private sector participation\nmodalities can contribute to the poverty reduction impact of transport and energy. ADB\u2019s\ndeveloping member country (DMC) governments have turned increasingly to the private\nsector to develop infrastructure and provide transport and energy services. The private\nsector has often proved better at  (i) mobilizing additional investment resources to finance\nservice  expansion  and  improvement;  and  (ii)  introducing  new  technologies,  better\nmanagement, and competition.4 Private sector participation is often an important factor in\nensuring the sustainability of transport and energy sector projects. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction\nand  private  sector  development  strategies  recognize  that  private  sector  participation  in\ntransport and energy can contribute to poverty reduction through the expansion of facilities\nand  services,  and  improvement  of  corporate  governance  and  responsibility.  However,\ncomparatively little attention has been paid to examining which models of private sector\nparticipation contribute most effectively to poverty reduction. For example, what are the best\nways of ensuring that the private sector extends affordable services to the poor? There is a\nneed for analysis of (i) the poverty reduction impacts of the many approaches followed by the\nprivate sector and private-public partnerships in developing infrastructure, and (ii) the models\nfor structuring and regulating the market to protect the interests of the public, particularly the\npoor.\n9. A range of methodologies and tools are needed for examining the poverty reduction\nimpacts of different types of infrastructure in different settings. Some types of infrastructure,\n                                                \n4  Examples of private sector participation have included toll roads, urban mass transit, ports, road transport\nservices, electricity generation and supply, and gas production and supply.", "3\nsuch as rural roads or rural electrification, may have a relatively localized area of influence.\nIn  such  cases,  it  may  be  possible  to  trace  the  various  contributions  to  socioeconomic\nactivities  leading  to  poverty  reduction.  In  other  cases  the  influence  of  an  infrastructure\nimprovement may extend far beyond its physical location, and more complex methodologies\nmay be required to distinguish impacts. This is generally the case with primary transport\nlinks, such as trunk roads and railways that form part of national and international networks,\nor major port development that can have a general influence on trade. It is also true of\ninvestments in energy generation and transmission for a national grid.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n10. The primary objective of the TA is to enhance the current understanding of how\ntransport and energy infrastructure and services contribute to poverty reduction, to fill gaps in\nempirical  knowledge,  and  identify  lessons  learned  and  good  practices  to  be  taken  into\naccount in future in ADB operations. The TA will (i) determine how different kinds of transport\nand energy investments have contributed to poverty reduction, (ii) establish benchmarks,\nand (iii) identify success stories and lessons learned. In examining the poverty reduction\ncontribution, due regard will be taken of environmental considerations.\n11. The  secondary  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  contribute  to  (i)  formulation  of  the\ninfrastructure elements of national or regional poverty reduction strategies in the DMCs\nwhere  TA  case  studies  are  conducted,  and  (ii)  capacity  building  within  DMC  research\ninstitutions concerned with policy-oriented research on poverty and infrastructure.\nB.  Scope\n12. The TA will be implemented in three stages. In stage 1, it will assess the current\nknowledge of how transport and energy infrastructure impacts on poverty reduction, and\nidentify gaps in that knowledge. In stage 2, country case studies will be conducted to fill the\ngaps identified in stage 1. The findings of the TA will be collated and disseminated in stage 3.\nDetails of the three stages are provided in Appendix 2.\n13. Stage 1 will consist of a review of the present state of knowledge about the poverty\nreduction  impact  of  each  of  the  main  types  of  transport  and  energy  infrastructure  and\nservices, and the main modalities of development by the public sector and public-private\npartnerships. The review will include an assessment of the literature, and discussions with\nstaff of ADB and other international development agencies. The review will provide the basis\nfor identifying a series of critical gaps in knowledge and empirical evidence. A shortlist of\ncritical  gaps  will  be  used  for  selecting  the  types  of  transport  and  energy  infrastructure\ndevelopment to be examined through case studies in selected DMCs in stage 2. The stage 1\nreport will present the state of knowledge and the critical gaps identified.\n14. In stage 2, retrospective studies will be conducted in three DMCs. In each country,\ncase studies will examine the poverty reduction impacts of the selected types of transport\nand  energy  infrastructure  development.  These  country-level  case  studies  will  treat\ngovernance  as  a  crosscutting  issue  affecting  both  sectors.  The  case  studies  will  also\nexamine  what  measures  have  been  taken  to  mitigate  possible  adverse  environmental\nimpacts  on  the  poor,  and  to  protect  the  environment  (e.g.,  by  reducing  deforestation\npressures). In each country a consolidated study will be prepared to present overall findings", "4\non  the  relationship  between  transport  and  energy  provision  and  poverty  reduction,  and\nidentify  emerging  lessons  and  good  practices  for  realizing  the  potential  contribution  to\npoverty reduction.\n15. The following criteria will be used to select the three DMCs for case study work: (i)\ntrack record of having improved transport and energy; (ii) availability of poverty data for time\nseries and geographically disaggregated comparisons; (iii) capable domestic development\nresearch institutes; and (iv) a representative mix of countries, including both economic and\ncultural diversity, and a balance between subregions. An example of a suitable mix of\ncountries might be Thailand, one province in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and one of\nADB\u2019s focal states in India.5\n16. Case study methods will give priority to quantifying the impacts of transport and\nenergy  on  (i)  income  poverty;  (ii)  vulnerability  and  diversification  of  income  generating\nactivities; (iii) human basic needs; and (iv) participation, empowerment, social exclusion, and\nsocietal  transformation.  Methodologies  will  be  based  on  the  understanding  that\nimprovements in transport or energy infrastructure rarely happen in isolation and all past\npoverty reduction should not be attributed to such improvements. In addition to an analysis of\nnational and regional data on poverty, transport, and energy indicators, the assessment of\npoverty reduction impacts will be based on a series of participatory surveys. These will\nsupplement the understanding of each case study by determining the experiences of the\ncommunities affected by the transport and energy improvements in question.\n17. In stage 3, a comprehensive report will be prepared, consolidating the findings of the\nfirst two stages. This report will take into account the outcomes of national workshops to be\nheld in each of the case study countries, and a seminar to be held at ADB headquarters. The\nreport will describe how different types of transport and energy investment impact on poverty,\nestablish associated benchmarks to help quantify such impacts, and identify lessons and\ngood practices to be taken into account in future in ADB operations.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent. This will be financed in\nfull from a grant from the ADB-funded TA program. The costs will include consulting services,\nworkshops,  and  development  of  a  web  site.    Detailed  cost  estimates  are  provided  in\nAppendix 3.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n19. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB\u2019s Infrastructure, Energy, and\nFinancial  Sectors  Department  (West)  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  and  day-to-day\nmonitoring of TA activities. The TA will involve ADB-wide collaboration through a steering\ncommittee,  including  the  infrastructure  and  programs  departments,  their  transport  and\ncommunications and energy divisions, the water supply, urban development, and housing\ndivisions, the Private Sector Group, the Economics and Development Resource Center and\nthe Poverty Reduction Unit. Other development organizations with a strong interest in the\nlinkage between infrastructure provision and poverty reduction will be invited to participate\nthrough the steering committee. The participating organizations are expected to include\nDFID, JBIC, Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, and the World Bank.\n                                                \n5  Gujarat, Kerala, or Madhya Pradesh.", "5\n20. Infrastructure, Energy, and Financial Sectors Department (West) will supervise and\ncoordinate the work of the consultants.

Introduction\n1. The  TA  will  be  conducted  in  three  stages:  (i)  review  of  state  of  knowledge  and\nidentification of gaps in empirical evidence to be filled by country-level case studies, (ii) country\ncase studies, and (iii) preparation and dissemination of overall findings.\nB.  Stage 1: Review of State of Knowledge and Identification of Gaps\n2. A review will be conducted of the present state of knowledge about the poverty reduction\nimpact of each of the main types of transport and energy infrastructure and services, and the\nmain modalities of development by the public sector and public-private partnerships. The review\nwill include an assessment of the available literature, and discussions with staff of ADB and\nother international development agencies.\n3. The review will consider the various transport modes and energy types, serving different\ntypes of local, national, and international markets or needs, and involving different models of\npublic and private sector infrastructure development. It will consider the available methodologies\nand  tools  for  distinguishing  the  impacts  of  infrastructure  from  those  of  the  socioeconomic\nactivities it enables, and for measuring impacts that cover a wide geographical area or cut\nacross social categories, including possible environmental impacts.\n4. The review will also consider the existing knowledge on available methodologies and\nbest practices in project design, which have been shown to increase the poverty reduction focus\nof infrastructure projects and make them more inclusive and responsive to the country-specific\nneeds of the poor.\n5. Following the review, a set of preliminary conceptual frameworks will be prepared to\nshow how the main types of infrastructure, and associated provision modalities, contribute to\npoverty reduction. Using these conceptual frameworks, an analysis will be prepared of how\neach of the main types of infrastructure and provision modalities contribute to poverty reduction,\nincluding a discussion of how these impacts may be quantified. Through this exercise a series\nof critical gaps in knowledge and empirical evidence will be identified. A shortlist of critical gaps\nwill be used for selecting the types of transport and energy infrastructure provision to be\nexamined through case studies in selected developing member countries (DMCs) in stage 2. In\naddition, a series of cross-cutting themes and issues will be identified for inclusion under the\nstage 2 case studies. The stage 1 report will present the state of knowledge and the critical\ngaps identified.\nC.  Stage 2: Country Case Studies\n6. Retrospective studies will be conducted in three DMCs. In each country, case studies\nwill be prepared to examine the poverty reduction impacts of the selected types of transport and\nenergy infrastructure provision. A consolidated study will be prepared to present the overall\nfindings on the relationship between transport and energy provision and poverty reduction, and\nidentify emerging lessons and good practices for realizing the potential contribution to poverty\nreduction.\n(Reference in text: page 3, para. 12)", "8\nAppendix 2, page 2\n7. The following criteria will be used to select the three DMCs for case study work: (i) track\nrecord of having improved transport and energy; (ii) availability of poverty data for time series\nand geographically disaggregated comparisons; (iii) capable domestic development research\ninstitutes; (iv) a representative mix of countries, including both economic and cultural diversity,\nand  a  balance  between  subregions.  An  example  of  a  suitable  mix  of  countries  might  be\nThailand, one province in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and one of ADB\u2019s focal states in\nIndia.1\n8. Examples  of  different  types  of  transport  projects  that  may  be  examined  in  stage 2\ninclude: (i) primary road or rail links (including new construction and capacity expansion such as\nwidening to four lanes), (ii) rural roads, (iii) ports, (iv) airports, (v) public transport services, and\n(vi) urban transport.\n9. Examples of possible energy case studies that may be examined in stage 2 include (i) a\nsector review of how policies and investment practices contribute to poverty reduction; (ii)\nprojects with large-scale, macro-level indirect impacts, such as power generation, transmission,\nand distribution projects; and (iii) projects that can be directly targeted at poor beneficiaries at\nthe micro level, such as rural electrification and renewable energy projects aiming at providing\nrural communities and poor people with improved access to efficient energy sources.\n10. The country-level case studies work in stage 2 will treat governance as a cross-cutting\nissue. Governance performance may often have a significant influence on project sustainability\nand the equitable allocation of resources and service delivery outcomes. Impacts on the poor\nmay be influenced by the approach to development planning in the transport and energy sectors\nand the associated pattern of public expenditure, the sensitivity of the policy and institutional\nframework to poverty reduction and equity, the regulatory mechanisms in place, and the type of\nproject implementation arrangements that are used. The case studies will also examine what\nmeasures were adopted to mitigate possible adverse environmental impacts on the poor, and to\nprotect the environment (e.g. reducing deforestation pressures).\n11. The case studies will examine additional themes arising from the stage 1 work. One\nsuch theme is the idea that \u201croads come first\u201d \u2013 road improvement is often the catalyst for other\ndevelopment. Another possible theme might be called \u201ctree and branch\u201d \u2013 the poverty reduction\nimpacts of rural transport and energy infrastructure may depend to an extent on the regional\nand national level infrastructure they connect into.\n12. Case study methods will give priority to a quantification of the impacts of transport and\nenergy on (i) income poverty; (ii) vulnerability and diversification of income generating activities;\n(iii) human basic needs, and (iv) participation, empowerment, social exclusion, and societal\ntransformation. Methodologies will be developed  on the understanding that improvements in\ntransport or energy infrastructure rarely happen in isolation, and all past poverty reduction\nshould  not  be  attributed  to  infrastructure  improvement.  Where  possible,  cases  studies  will\ncompare  a  with-improvement  example  that  benefited  from  improvement  against  a  without-\nimprovement  example  that  did  not,  with  both  examples  having  had  similar  geographical,\nsocioeconomic, and transport characteristics before the improvement took place.2 In addition to\nan analysis of national and regional data on poverty, transport, and energy indicators, the\nassessment of poverty impacts will be based on a series of participatory surveys. These will\n                                                \n1   Gujarat, Kerala, or Madhya Pradesh.\n2  An example of this approach is found in: World Bank. 1996.
