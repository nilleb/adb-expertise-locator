The Government of Pakistan accords high priority to proper monitoring of public sector \ndevelopment  projects  (PSDPs)  to  establish  and  upgrade  infrastructure  and  save  precious \nbudgetary resources. It has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in designing \nand implementing results-based monitoring (RBM) of project performance. The ongoing TA \n39821 is designing a dedicated project monitoring and evaluation system (PMES) software, \nwhich needs to be strengthened further, made sustainable, and its scope expanded to enable \nRBM  of  project  performance.  The  work  entails  capacity  development  at  the  federal  and \nprovincial planning levels, expanding to include line ministries at the federal level and line \ndepartments at the provincial level, modifying existing software to include preparation of project \ndocuments to enable establishment of proper control points for RBM, and securing appropriate \nlicenses to ensure sustainability of the PMES. The 2005 country strategy and program for \nPakistan includes technical assistance (TA) for strengthening RBM, taking into account the \nfindings of TA 3982. The Mission fielded in October 2005 reached an understanding with the \nGovernment  on  the  objectives,  scope,  approach,  terms  of  reference,  and  implementation \narrangements of the TA2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan has shown remarkable success in the turnaround of its economy promoted by \nfar-reaching economic, fiscal, and governance reforms and supported by the international aid \ncommunity. ADB has assisted the Government\u2019s development and governance reform agenda \nand, as a result of its long-standing relationship, is now engaged in supporting Pakistan\u2019s more \nchallenging  second-generation  reforms.  These  include  addressing  the  Government\u2019s \ninstitutional  constraints  to  development  and  thereby  improving  and  increasing  employment \nopportunities. In its medium-term development framework (MTDF) that covers the 2005-2010 \nperiod, the Government recognizes the large backlog of infrastructure investments in both urban \nand  rural  Pakistan  that  are  required  to  improve  Pakistan\u2019s  competitiveness,  augment \nemployment opportunities, and reduce poverty. Infrastructure entails fixed assets and services \nrelated to transport (roads, airports, rail, mass transport systems, and ports), water supply and \nsanitation, solid waste treatment, education, health, and other small development projects like \nenergy, power, telecom, irrigation, and water storage. \n \n3.  With economic growth exceeding an annual rate of 5%, Pakistan\u2019s business climate and \nconfidence have improved considerably since the year 2000. By June 2005 the fiscal deficit was \nreduced significantly to 3.3% of the gross domestic product, and its debt service ratio has \ndropped substantially. Reforms associated with reduced support to important sectors, including \nthe social sectors (education, health, and safe access to basic services [water and electricity]) \nand local governance reforms pose challenges to local governments capability to implement its \nfunctions. \n \n4.  To further improve debt management, the Government is committed to maintaining \nprudent fiscal management, which limits its ability to borrow. Government estimates in MTDF \nindicate that only half of its investment needs can be covered from FY2006 to FY2010 under \nnormal budget allocations. Modern approaches are required to effectively manage public sector \nresources and investments that are heavily constrained under the conventional planning and \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.  Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Strengthening Portfolio Performance and \nMonitoring. Manila (TA 3982-PAK). \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 1 December 2005. \n ", "2  \napproval processes. Particular effort is required to leverage the professional skills, incentives, \nand financial resources in establishing, managing, and monitoring PSDPs. Poor performance of \nPSDPs is often a result of ineffective monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Increasing M&E ability \nwill result in minimum system losses, timely delivery, and the measurement of performance. \nWhile  the  Government  is  keen  to  monitor  PSDPs,  its  effective  RBM  capacity  requires \nimprovement, as monitoring PSDP and helping public sector organizations to work better are \none of the most persistent and difficult challenges.  \n \n5.  The Government recognizes the need to improve PSDP performance and has initiated \nsteps to identify weaknesses in the existing project management and monitoring system for \nnecessary procedural streamlining and strengthening PSDP monitoring. Acknowledging that a \nconsistent  RBM  policy  needs  to  be  developed  to  address  the  above  constraints,  the \nGovernment has established a high-level Prime Minister\u2019s Monitoring Committee (PMC) to \nregularly monitor various project implementation issues and recommend measures for effective \nuse of aid resources.  \n \n6.  A coherent RBM strategy is needed, as no coherent policy and institutional framework \nexists, particularly at the provincial and local government levels. Policies need to address \ncomplexities across various levels of jurisdiction, blurring clear assignment of ownership and \naccountability,  and  division  of  regulatory  responsibilities,  consumer  protection,  and  service \ndelivery functions and powers of public entities. While Local Government Ordinance (LGO) \n2001 assigns accountability to local governments, services are de facto maintained by agencies \nat a higher level. It is uncertain whether the local government will be able to fulfill the M&E \nfunction  as  prescribed  by  the  LGO,  as  the  project  management  strength  and  monitoring \ncapacity of provincial, district and municipal governments are currently extremely limited and \nneed to be strengthened via policies that improve project identification, structuring, management \nand monitoring capacity.  \n \n7.  The Government\u2019s ability to prepare, manage, and oversee RBM is largely absent. \nBecause of the absence of proper RBM mechanisms, conflict of interest undermines PSDP \nusage and efficiency. Public sector expertise in project management and monitoring must also \nbe nurtured, as M&E in Pakistan in the past often relied on external financing and management. \nCurrently,  the  PMES  role  is  nonexistent,  even  for  larger  PSDP  monitoring,  as  there  is  a \nmisunderstanding among some agencies on the benefit of the PMES and vested interests favor \nthe status quo. It is thus essential that the PMES be well understood and the RBM modules \ndeveloped through a consultative process. It is understood that the PMES can become really \neffective  if  it  raises  M&E  standards  and  is  found  more  viable  than  existing  public  sector \nmonitoring mechanisms. Important constraints need to be addressed within the PMES, including \ncapacity issues and the absence of in-house interdisciplinary skills in M&E. \n \n8.  Professional  support  is  required  to  develop  RBM  modules  and  need  to  be \ncomplemented with public sector commitment to enable RBM of PSDPs. The RBM TA and \nexperience will shape policy and institutional development, including Government capabilities \nfor monitoring and further managing the RBM process. The rationale for the RBM TA is to \nsupport the Government\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction through sustainable economic growth \nand increased employment opportunities. The TA and the RBM approach are timely and fits well \ninto  ADB\u2019s  support  of  Pakistan\u2019s  governance  reforms.  Therefore,  the  proposed  results-\norientation or RBM TA is a promising way forward and will reinforce ADB\u2019s efforts for sustained \nimprovement in project performance. \n \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected outcome of the TA is a streamlined system for Government M&E of \nPSDPs. The outcome will be realized by achieving the following outputs: (i) strengthened PMES \nat the Projects Wing (PW) of Federal Planning and Development Division (FPDD) and at the \nM&E units/cells of provincial planning and development boards/departments (PPDBs/PPDDs) in \nfour  provinces:  Balochistan,  North  West  Frontier  Province,  Punjab,  and  Sindh;  (ii)  the \nassignment  of  responsibility  for  RBM  to  core  PW  staff;  (iii)  relevant  staff  of  key  line \ndivisions/ministries trained in RBM; (iv) sustained information flow among stakeholders at the \nprovincial  and  federal  governments  through  FPDD,  Economic  Affairs  Division  (EAD),  and \nPPDBs/PPDDs; and (v) establishment of a comprehensive database for key project activities \nand financial performance. The desired impact is to enhance the efficiency and quality of \nPSDPs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  RBM  has  top  level  support  from  the  Government.  The  federal  Government  has \nestablished the PMC, initially monitoring all PSDPs over PRs 500 million, chaired by the advisor \nto the Prime Minister on finance. Members of the PMC include high-level representatives of \ngovernment with the additional secretary of FPDD as the PMC secretary. The TA will provide \nnecessary resources and expertise to support the Government's M&E effort by RBM of project \nimplementation,  analyze  the  existing  weaknesses  and  reasons  for  delay  in  project \nimplementation, and address the required remedial steps; and the decision-making authorities \nin  project  implementation.  The  PW  will  be assisted  by  a  TA  implementation  office  (TAIO) \nsecretariat,  which  will  manage  the  PMES  and  monitor  overall  progress,  disseminate  RBM \ninformation  for  feedback  through  web  site,  bulletins,  and  seminars.  To  ensure  adequate \nimplementation capacity, the TAIO will be properly staffed by February 2006. The TA will be \nimplemented by a team of experienced international and domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill  work  closely  with  the  Government's  counterpart  staff,  in  consultation  with  the  key \nstakeholders involved in the decision making, implementation, and monitoring of projects. The \nconsultants\u2019  work  will  be  closely  supervised  by  ADB,  and  guided  and  monitored  by  the \nGovernment through a high-level federal steering committee. Workshops will be organized to \nsolicit views of the stakeholders at different levels of the Government on project implementation, \nportfolio management, and RBM issues and agree on remedial actions. The consultants will \nundertake  a  number  of  well-defined  and  sequenced  activities,  such  as  software  analysis \nincluding  institutional  setup;  training  needs  assessment,  training  manuals  on  PMES,  and \nimparting hands-on-training for relevant staff; development of RBM indicators; and preparation \nof an action plan and a road map for institutionalizing the PMES during the TA and on a \nsustained arrangement after its completion. \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. In phase 1 (April to May 2006 [2 months]) a \ncomprehensive diagnosis of the PMES will be carried out to identify key training requirements \nand issues and make recommendations along with a training plan to speed up the process. The \ndiagnosis will include a review of existing Government monitoring procedures. The design \nphase (from June to September 2006) will start near the end of the diagnostic phase. To better \nunderstand issues and to recommend appropriate changes and improvements in the PMES and \nRBM, a pilot activity encompassing RBM of select projects will be carried out. The work will \ninvolve provision of support to PW for RBM and Electronic Government Directorate (EGD) to \nmanage the portal and database of select projects. In phase 3 (from September 2006 to \n ", "4  \nDecember  2007  [16  months]),  the  scope  of  PMES-RBM  will  be  expanded  to  cover \nimplementation of other key sector projects. During this phase, workshops will be conducted to \nshare the results with and get feedback from key stakeholders. The TA will help develop the \nfollowing tentative outputs and key results areas (KRAs). (The TA framework is in Appendix 1 \nand detailed outputs and sequencing are in Appendix 2.) \n \n(i)  Output 1: Operationalize the PMES \nKRA 1.1 Training need assessment for PMES operationalization \nKRA 1.2 Implementation of training to speed up the process \nKRA 1.3 Support for operationalization via strengthening of PW, FPDD, EAD, \nand EGD \n(ii)  Output 2: Develop supporting RBM modules in PMES \nKRA 2.1 Development and incorporation of appropriate RBM modules \nKRA 2.2 RBM of select projects \n(iii)  Output 3: RBM of key PSDPs via the PMES \nKRA 3.1 Review of RBM modules and incorporation of appropriate changes \nKRA 3.2 Expansion of RBM to cover other PSDPs in few key sectors \n \n12.  The  TA  will  help  develop  a  comprehensive  database  for  key  project  activities  and \nfinancial performance to strengthen the RBM system of FPDD and PPDDs/PPDB through an \neffective PMES with appropriate arrangements established for constant flow of information to \nthose  concerned  in  the  decision-making  system,  including  EAD,  line  ministries  and \ndepartments. By doing this, the TA will integrate the PMES with the decision makers at higher \nlevels and those directly involved in project implementation for efficient portfolio management \nand improved PSDP performance. The TA will identify the core staff requirement and logistic \nsupport for sustaining the PMES, define their responsibilities, and provide extensive training for \ncapacity development within the PW, EAD, and the M&E units at PPDBs/PPDDs and the key \nline agencies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000. ADB will provide $500,000 equivalent \nfinancing  for  the  TA  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nremaining cost of $200,000 equivalent including provision of suitable counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, secretarial services, and telephone. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  FPDD will be the Executing Agency and PW will be the Implementing Agency for the TA. \nA federal TA steering committee will be headed by the secretary of FPDD, with members from \nEAD, EGD, Finance Division, Planning Commission, lead line ministries, Auditor General's \nOffice and PPDBs/PPDDs. The committee will meet regularly to provide periodic guidance on \nTA implementation, and will be responsible for implementing the different recommendations of \nthe  TA.  An  executive  committee  headed  by  the  additional  secretary,  FPDD  will  also  be \nestablished  to  coordinate  the  efforts  and  FPDD  has  committed  to  provide  permanent \ncounterpart  staff,  provide  suitable  offices,  and  facilitate  the  consultants\u2019  interaction  with \nstakeholders, and in close collaboration with ADB, ensure the sustainability and expansion of \nthe PMES to support RBM by the stakeholders. \n \n ", "  5\n15.  Given the nature of issues to be addressed, and capacity development through hands-\non-training to institutionalize RBM, the TA will be implemented over 2 years from the date the \nGovernment signs the TA letter and is expected to be completed by January 2008. FPPD will \nestablish a TAIO under its PW for overall implementation, coordination and monitoring of the TA, \nto be headed by a federal project director. The PPDBs/PPDDs will appoint a project coordinator. \nIn addition, EGD will coordinate TA implementation by interfacing with TAIO for complementing \nthe software-related work, and will be provided with necessary logistical support in this regard. \nThe TA will provide a total of 58 person-months of consulting services: including 54 domestic \nand 4 international. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The \nconsultants  will  be  individually  selected  during  TA  implementation  to  ensure  quick \nresponsiveness to the emerging RBM needs articulated by the Government and FPDD. The \nconsultants will be selected by ADB in consultation with the PW in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting \nand engaging domestic consultants. The services of consultants are expected to commence in \nor  around  April  2006.  Equipment  to  be  provided  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the \nconsultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The review of the diagnostic \nphase is expected within 2 months of the fielding of consultants; of the design phase, within 4 \nmonths of the fielding of consultants; and implementation as agreed upon with ADB. The \nconsultants will provide reports as defined in their specific consulting contracts. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.

The pilot project includes RBM of select projects including selection and monitoring via \nthe PMES. The pilot project will establish a RBM model and processes that are comparable with \nsuccessful best practices, and will set RBM standards. Larger development projects with clearly \nidentifiable outputs may be suitable candidates. It is important that RBM not be stand-alone \nmonitoring; it will supplement the monitoring being done via the PMES to measure outputs. The \nconsultants will have no responsibility for monitoring any individual project and will not intervene \nin decisions regarding the governance, management, or financial outcome of a project.  \nC.  Output 3: RBM of Key PSDPs via PMES \n7.  In addition to the above measures, the line ministries require convincing that the PMES \nis a viable option and their RBM capacity need to be strengthened. It is critical that high-level \ngovernment support continues to make sure that RBM of all PSDPs is done via the PMES as \nspeedily as possible. \n1.  KRA  3.1.
