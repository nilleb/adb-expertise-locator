I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan funded by the ordinary capital resources (the A-Loan) from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), and (ii) a proposed loan funded through the participation of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Infrastructure Fund (the B-Loan), both to the Republic of Indonesia for \nthe Java\u2013Bali 500-Kilovolt (kV) Power Transmission Crossing Project.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  investment  project  will  support  the  Government  of  Indonesia  in  the \ndevelopment of the Java\u2013Bali power transmission network for meeting future power demand in \nBali while improving the long-term power supply security and efficiency of the Java\u2013Bali power \ngrid.2 The project will (i) develop the electricity transmission infrastructure by constructing 220 \nkilometers (km) of extra high voltage (500 kV) transmission lines with capacity to transmit 1,500 \nmegawatts (MW) of power; (ii) develop 500/150 kV and 150/20 kV substations in Bali and Java; \nand (iii) support project management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.    National development plan. With the aim of transforming Indonesia into a developed \ncountry by 2025, the government in May 2011 launched a 14-year master plan to accelerate \neconomic  development  throughout  the  archipelago.3 Infrastructure  development,  including \npower infrastructure, is essential in supporting national connectivity required in the development \nactivities of all the sectors identified in the above master plan, hence infrastructure development \nis  a  key  component  of  Indonesia's  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132014 \n(RPJMN).4   \n \n4.  Power sector assessment. Peak power demand in Indonesia averaged 30,000 MW in \n2012 and is expected to grow at an average rate of 9.4% annually up to 2021.5 The current \naverage electrification ratio is about 72% in Indonesia, and the government's target is to achieve \n90%  electrification  by  2020.  Power  shortage  has  been  a  critical  infrastructure  bottleneck \nthroughout the country and fast-track generation programs are being implemented to increase \nthe power generation capacity.6 In addition, transmission and distribution systems have limited \ncapacities  to  transmit  additional  power  because  of  inadequate  investments  in  the  past. \nTherefore, the transmission and distribution networks need to be developed in a coordinated \nmanner to realize the benefits of the new generation capacities and to achieve the government\u2019s \nelectrification targets. \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Jakarta. \n6   In  2006, the  government  launched  an  accelerated  coal-based  power  development program  to  reduce the \ndependency on expensive oil-based generation. The program aimed at adding 10,000 MW of new generation \ncapacity by 2010. Nearly 70% of this target was largely achieved and completion is expected in 2014. A second \naccelerated program was launched in 2009 for adding an additional 10,000 MW of generation capacity by 2018. \nThis program foresees 60% of the generation from renewable energy sources, mainly geothermal and hydro.   \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Bali  power  supply  situation.  Bali  is  Indonesia's  top  tourism  showpiece. 7  The \ncommercial sector accounts for about 46% of the total energy consumption in Bali, which \nincludes the hotel industry and associated services. However, the Bali power system suffers \nfrom frequent outages and blackouts due to low generation reserve margin and transmission \nbottlenecks. The peak demand in Bali in 2012 was 618 MW and supply capacity was 633 MW, \nresulting in a generation reserve margin of only 15 MW (2.4%). The demand is projected to \ngrow at an average rate of 9.6% per year during 2012\u25002022 and expected to reach 1,619 MW \nby 2022. The Java\u2013Bali power system is linked by two existing 150 kV undersea cables with a \ntotal capacity of 200 MW. In addition, two 150 kV undersea cables are being installed by the \nState Electricity Company (PLN),8 to add another 200 MW by 2014. There are 526 MW of diesel \npower generators operating in Bali that will be eventually phased out due to (i) a policy decision \nby the Bali provincial government to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and minimize noise \npollution in Bali; and (ii) the phasing out of diesel-based generation by PLN because they are \nsignificantly more expensive to operate than other forms of generation. Therefore, investments \nare required to augment the power system in Bali by strengthening the transmission capacity \nfrom Java to Bali and install more economical, less polluting generating plants in Bali itself.  \n \n6.  Technically and economically feasible development option. Transmission of power \nfrom East Java to Bali at 500 kV has been determined as the optimal solution to improve the \npower supply in Bali based on the power system studies carried out in the preparation of least-\ncost generation expansion plan and long-term transmission development plan. Therefore, this \nproject is included in PLN\u2019s power supply business plan (footnote 5). As the power demand in \nBali is only about 2.5% of the total demand of the Java\u2013Bali power grid, coupling it with more \nefficient generation capacity in Java, transmitting power from Java would be a more technically \nand economically feasible option before installing new generation plants in Bali. Accordingly, \nPLN has conducted the initial design of a 500 kV double circuit overhead transmission line from \nJava to Bali, with a total transmission capacity of 3,600 megavolt-amperes (MVA) with power \ncapacity  of  3,000  MW to  be  operational  by  2016.9 The  project  will  alleviate  the  imminent \nshortage of power supply capacity in Bali. The project is also included in the government\u2019s \nGreen Book 2013, which lists planned priority external loans.10 \n \n7.  Project relevance. The project will contribute to long-term power supply security in Bali \nand ensure the provision of adequate and reliable power supply that is vital for economic \ndevelopment activities identified in Bali under the Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of \nIndonesia Economic Development (MP3EI) (footnote 3). The project will strengthen the power \ntransmission system by connecting Bali with a 500 kV link to Java\u2013Bali grid, thus facilitating \nefficient utilization of existing and planned large power generation plants in Java. Hence, the \nproject  will  enable  transmitting  comparatively  cheaper  power  to  Bali.  Currently,  PLN  relies \nmainly  on  expensive  diesel-based  generation  to  supply  electricity  in  Bali.  The  proposed \ntransmission  line  will  reduce  operational  expenditures,  which  will  also  reduce  the  subsidy \npayments made to PLN by the government. PLN\u2019s investment in the project is also part of its \nnationwide plan to increase electrification.11 The development of the 150/20 kV substations \n                                                \n7  Bali is an internationally renowned tourist and cultural destination that contributes 6% of the national gross \ndomestic product. Tourism generates 67% of Bali's gross regional domestic product, and about 70% of residents \nare directly or indirectly dependent on the tourism industry. \n8  PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara.  \n9  Technical losses are less in 500 kV transmission lines and power transfer capacity is higher compared to 150 kV \nand 275 kV transmission lines, which are the standard high voltage transmission voltages in Indonesia. \n10 National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2013. Daftar Rencana Prioritas Pinjaman (Green Book) \n2013. Jakarta. \n11 The electrification ratio in Bali in 2012 was 69%; the government aims to achieve 90% electrification by 2020. \n ", "3 \nunder the project along the proposed route of the transmission line also ensures improved \naccess to electricity to the local rural communities in the project area. \n \n8.  ADB  energy  sector  strategy. The development of power infrastructure required to \nrelieve  power  supply  constraints  and regional  transmission  interconnection  projects  are  an \nintegral  part  of    ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  to  reduce  the  overall  generation  reserve \nrequirements, improve system stability and reliability, and enable transmission of comparatively \ncheaper power from one area to another.12 In addition, ADB\u2019s involvement in the project will \nensure  strict  compliance  in  the  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards \nrequirements in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project is well \naligned  to  ADB\u2019s  present  energy  sector  strategy  and  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  and  country  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132014  for \nIndonesia.13  \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s continued support in the energy sector and experience. To date, ADB has \nfinanced 30 projects in Indonesia totaling about $3.3 billion and 36 technical assistance projects \ntotaling about $14 million focusing on power generation and transmission subsectors. In the \ntransmission subsector, ADB is also providing strategic public\u2013private financing for strengthening \nthe  West  Kalimantan  power  grid  to  facilitate  power  trade  with  Sarawak,  Malaysia. 14 \nFurthermore, development of renewable energy, particularly hydro and geothermal and the \nSumatra\u2013Peninsular Malaysia 500 kV undersea interconnection is currently under discussion. \nThe ADB\u2019s portfolio and sector work is well coordinated among other development partners in \nIndonesia.15 Based on the lessons learned, to mitigate the project delays, the project design \nwas enhanced incorporating advance contracting; efficient procurement procedures; project \nimplementation consultants; and on-the-job training for the PLN staff in project implementation, \nand preparing and implementing safeguard measures effectively. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the project will be long-term power supply security to support sustained \nsocioeconomic growth in Bali. The outcome will be increased capacity of the Java\u2013Bali power \ntransmission network. \n  \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The  project has three outputs: (i) development of 220 km of 500 kV transmission \nnetwork between Java and Bali (a new double circuit transmission line, which includes the \nfollowing subcomponents:  131 km line between the Paiton substation and Watudodol in Java, 4 \nkm line across the Bali Strait between Watudodol and Segara Rupek, 10 km line between \nSegara  Rupek  and  Gilimanuk,  and  75  km  line  between  Gilimanuk  and  Antosari);  (ii) \ndevelopment of 500/150 kV and 150/20 kV substations in Java and Bali (the extension of the \nexisting 500 kV Paiton substation in East Java, the construction of a new 500/150 kV, 2x500 \nMVA capacity substation at Antosari in Bali, and the upgrading of eleven 150/20 kV substations \nwith  600  MVA  additional  capacity);  and  (iii)  support  project  management  (construction \nsupervision, supervision and monitoring of safeguards, and capacity building). \n                                                \n12 Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB.  2012.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n \n17.  The transmission network and the substation developments under the project are part of \nthe power sector development plans prepared based on system studies that includes several \ninterrelated  elements,  including  demand  growth,  distribution  and  transmission  system \ndevelopment plans, the least-cost generation expansion plan, and the river basin plan. Wien \nAutomatic System Planning was the software used for the least-cost generation expansion \nstudies and Power System Simulator for Engineering was used for the transmission system \nstudies.18  \n \n18.  Due  diligence  during  project  preparation  have  confirmed  adequate  project  design. \nExhaustive  engineering  design  and  power  system  calculations  ensure  robust  and  optimal \ntransmission  network  development  based  on  internationally  proven  extra  high  voltage \nalternating current transmission technology. Technical due diligence covers the overall project, \nincluding the 4 km overhead crossing across the Bali Strait, which confirms the overhead \ntransmission line crossing to be the preferred option than undersea cable option due to the \ntechnical risks, environmental and social impacts, and higher costs involved with undersea \ncables and their installation. Technical design of this transmission crossing will involve two towers \neach with a height of about 376 meters, making them marginally the world\u2019s tallest power pylons. \nThere exist other similar transmission line crossings that use high towers with proven technology.19 \nThe project\u2019s technical concept and design meet international standards. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  Financial viability was assessed by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \nproject. The incremental benefits were calculated based on PLN\u2019s revenue stream from power \nsales while costs include capital investments, operation and maintenance costs, and taxes \nincurred to install and operate the project. The post-tax financial internal rate of return of the \nproject is 10.5%, which compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital \nof 2.5%, confirming the project\u2019s financial viability.20 ADB reviewed PLN\u2019s financial performance \nand projections, including its capacity to finance its investment needs and the adequacy of its \ncapital structure to meet its debt service requirements.21 \n \n20.  The economic analysis confirms that the project is economically beneficial. The analysis \nyields an economic internal rate of return of 25.5% and the sensitivity analyses show that this \nexpected economic performance is robust.22 The economic internal rate of return compares the \nannual  streams  of  economic  capital  and  operating  costs  against  incremental  benefits  and \nresource savings due to displacement of the expensive diesel-based power being supplied at \npresent.

Governance \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PLN. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \n22.  To ensure transparency and good governance, PLN will publicly disclose information on \nhow loan proceeds are being used on its website. For each procurement contract, PLN will \ndisclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details \non bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, (v) a list of goods and \nservices purchased, and (vi) the intended and actual utilization of loan proceeds. ADB will \norganize  special  training  for  PLN  staff  on  ADB  procedures,  including  implementation, \nprocurement, use of consultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, and prevention of fraud \nand corruption. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project will be subject to \nprior ADB approval and will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine \nthe records and accounts of the executing agency, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the project.   \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n23.  The poverty and social analysis assessed impacts at the sector level, since identifying \nspecific consumers is challenging in the context of transmission network expansion. The project \nwill benefit poor households in the rural areas of Bali and Java when the government\u2019s rural \nelectrification program is implemented. The current electrification ratio  in Bali is 69%. The \nproject area is located in East Java and in Bali  while the project\u2019s main beneficiary area is Bali. \nThe project will ensure adequate and reliable power supply that will enable industrial and \ncommercial growth, especially in  the tourism industry, and increased trading activities  that \ncreate jobs especially  for  low  income  groups.23 Basic  public  services,  including  education, \nhealth, and water supply, will improve because of increased access to electricity.24 The social \nimpact assessment carried out in June 2011 indicates that the project will benefit the entire \npopulation of 4 million people in Bali. Nearly 20% of the total beneficiary population is below the \nnational poverty line. Further, an estimated 2.6 million foreign tourists and floating population in \nBali will also benefit from reliable power supply.   \n \n24.  Transmission  projects  are,  by  their  nature,  unlikely  to  provide  opportunities  to \nincorporate gender elements into their design, but there will be direct and substantial benefits to \nwomen from improved energy supply. The project preparatory due diligence did not highlight \nspecific gender issues, although the project will benefit women and does not have any adverse \nimpacts or widen the gender inequality. The benefits from electricity will accrue largely in the \nform of labor savings, enhanced social interaction, and broadened options for work and other \nactivities. The resettlement plans for the project include specific actions to ensure women are \nincluded  effectively  in  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  process  (e.g.,  female-headed \nhouseholds and poor women).25  \n \n                                                \n23 Bali is the largest tourist destination in the country and is renowned for its highly developed small-scale private \nenterprises that encompass activities such as art, music, dance, sculpture, painting, leather, and metalworking. \nThe availability of reliable power supply in Bali will help these small-scale private enterprises create additional job \nopportunities. \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n25.  The risk of spreading HIV due to the project is very low. Nevertheless, to address any \nthreats during project implementation, information dissemination campaigns will be carried out \nin the project areas, which will be supervised by independent monitoring consultants. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Environment. The project is classified as environmental category \u201cA\u201d due to some \nsections  of  the  proposed  alignment  passing through  two  national  parks.  An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  has  been  undertaken  covering  all  project  components,  including \nfacilities  funded  by  PLN  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).26 \nRelevant Indonesian environmental policies, regulations, and guidelines were also considered in \nthe EIA. The draft EIA report was uploaded for public disclosure on the ADB website on 13 \nAugust 2012 and updated with a supplementary biodiversity study in June 2013. In accordance \nwith  the  government\u2019s  project  readiness  criteria,  PLN  prepared  a  separate  EIA  (Analisis \nMengenai Dampak Lingkungan), which was approved by the Ministry of Environment on 16 \nApril 2013. \n \n27.  Due consideration has been given to minimize environmental impacts in the selection of \nthe interconnection options and the selection of the final alignment of the transmission line and \nsites for substations. The most environmentally sensitive aspects of the project are the sections \nof the alignment through Baluran National Park in Java and Bali Barat National Park. In the \nBaluran National Park, the alignment will pass through 63 hectares (ha) of wilderness zone and \nspecial utilization zone. This includes a modified area of teak plantation that functions as a \nseasonal  wildlife  corridor for  a small  population  of  endangered  banteng  (Bos  javanicus).27 \nApproximately 12 km of the alignment will pass through the wilderness zone of Bali Barat \nNational Park. The park\u2019s wilderness zone includes several endangered species, but as per the \nEIA, the presence of wildlife other than birds is rare along the transmission line corridor and in \nthe vicinity. While Gilimanuk Bay may provide seasonal habitat for migratory birds, survey and \nexpert consultants indicated that there are no records of migratory birds in the bay. \n \n28.  A comprehensive package of environmental mitigation and offset measures has been \ndesigned to support biodiversity conservation in the two national parks. Specifically, the EMP \nincludes measures to (i) avoid negative impacts to sensitive wildlife species through careful \nscheduling of construction timing and poaching prevention; (ii) minimize vegetation clearing to \ntransmission line foundations, with limited or no clearing along the project right-of-way; and (iii) \noffset vegetation clearing through targeted restoration actions and the management of invasive \nspecies. In addition, PLN will provide financial resources to the two national parks through \ncollaborative  agreements,  which  will  include  (i)  captive  breeding  programs,  release,  and \nmonitoring in the wild; (ii) habitat monitoring and restoration in the transmission line right-of-way \narea; (iii) control of invasive species; (iv) compensation planting; and (v) provision of new water \nsources that are supportive of the parks\u2019 management plans.   \n \n29.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  developed  to  receive  affected  persons \nconcerns about the project\u2019s environmental performance and facilitate resolution. While PLN \nhas  extensive  experience  in  transmission  line  construction  and  operation  in  Indonesia,  its \nproject management unit, contractors, and park authorities will be trained on all aspects of the \nEMP, including mitigation requirements, health and safety requirements, and monitoring.

Regular implementation \nprogress reports will be submitted to ADB. In the event of any change of alignment or the \nidentification of unanticipated environmental impact during project implementation, PLN will \nrevise the EMP. To assist PLN, project implementation consultants will be engaged. In addition, \nindependent safeguards monitoring consultants will also be engaged for independent monitoring \nof the implementation of  the EMP. Comprehensive terms of reference for the  consultants, \nincluding  biodiversity  experts,  are  indicated  in  the  PAM  (footnote  17).  Further,  ADB  will \nimplement a small-scale technical assistance to provide long-term conservation benefits through \nstrengthening of operational management, monitoring, and capacity of the park authorities. \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement. No physical relocation of houses will be required as a result \nof the project. There are no houses or structures that will be totally or partially demolished due \nto the project except several boundary walls. A total of 717 ha of land will be affected by the \nproject (56 ha of permanent acquisition and 661 ha of restricted land use under the right-of-\nway), comprising 172 ha of forestry land and 545 ha of private or company land. A total of 1,200 \nhouseholds  (about  4,000  people)  will  be  affected  by  the  project,  of  which  305  affected \nhouseholds are considered vulnerable, including 143 severely affected households (about 472 \npeople).  \n \n31.  The project\u2019s involuntary resettlement category is \u201cA\u201d as the number of severely affected \npeople exceeds 200. A detailed land acquisition and resettlement plan has been prepared in \nconsultation with the affected people in 2012 and an updated plan was disclosed on ADB \nwebsite on 11 November 2013. In accordance with the land acquisition and resettlement plan, \npeople who are displaced will be given compensation at full replacement cost for their affected \nassets, including crop compensation for the land at the tower locations. The project authorities \nwill arrange training for the displaced people, including specific programs for skills development \nrequired in restoration activities that may be implemented in conjunction with nongovernment \norganizations. All relevant information regarding the project was disseminated and the opinions \nof the displaced persons were taken into consideration in developing the entitlement matrix. No \nindigenous people will be affected by the project.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risks. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.28 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProject implementation delays due  PLN has identified the land acquisition requirements for the transmission line \nto issues in land acquisition and  has put in place a comprehensive LARP in compliance with Asian Development \nresettlement.  Banks\u2019 safeguards policy statement. The LARP will be updated during detailed \ndesign phase with participation and consultation of all affected people. \nImplementation of LARP will start before the awarding of contracts. Capacity \nbuilding of PLN staff will be conducted and project implementation consultants \nwill be tasked to assist PLN in the implementation of LARP. \nProject implementation delays  Advanced procurement actions and retroactive financing will help mitigate the \nowing to procurement delays and  risk of procurement delays.
